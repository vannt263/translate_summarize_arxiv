    "in the past fifteen years , cold atoms and bose einstein condensates have proven invaluable tools to study the physics of interacting quantum systems @xcite .",
    "optical lattices @xcite and feshbach resonances @xcite have been used to drive these systems into strongly interacting regimes .",
    "recently , it has been shown that coupling between cold atoms and an electromagnetic field , for example by putting a condensate in a cavity , leads to interesting collective phases of light and matter @xcite .",
    "for example , the dicke transition @xcite , superradiant mott phases @xcite , self structuration of atoms and light @xcite , and crystallization @xcite have been observed in such systems .",
    "many theoretical predictions have also been made such as the possibility to observe bose glasses @xcite , localization @xcite , or synchronization of quantum dipoles @xcite .",
    "here we are especially interested in a recent experiment by the eth - zurich group @xcite where a cloud of cold atoms is placed in an optical lattice and inside an optical cavity .",
    "the field of the cavity mediates an effective infinite range interaction between the atoms which favours a density difference between neighbouring sites of the optical lattice .",
    "this experiment attracted a strong interest as it provides one of the first observations of the elusive supersolid phase @xcite .",
    "this exotic phase is characterized by both long range phase coherence and spatial ordering , i.e. simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal long range orders . in a recent experiment ,",
    "the same group observed a supersolid phase with a symmetry breaking of a continuous space invariance @xcite .",
    "the experimental system is well described by a conventional bose - hubbard model with an additional infinite range interaction @xcite , which takes into account the effect of the cavity field .",
    "this model and similar ones have been mostly studied within the ( static and dynamic ) mean - field theory@xcite ; only one study has employed an exact quantum monte carlo method in the hard - core limit @xcite . in the current state of the literature ,",
    "exact studies in the strong ( but finite ) interacting regime are still missing .    in this work ,",
    "we use exact quantum monte carlo simulations to determine the phase diagram of this model for several particle fillings , and elucidate the nature of the observed quantum phase transitions .",
    "we also compare our results with mean - field results , obtained with an approach based on the gutzwiller ansatz and classical monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the hamiltonian and the methods used are presented in sec .",

    "is then shown to be governed by a bose - hubbard model with hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath0 the bosonic operator @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) creates ( annihilates ) an atom at site @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the corresponding number operator . the indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote respectively even and odd lattice sites .",
    "the first term of the hamiltonian is the kinetic term describing tunnelling with amplitude @xmath7 between nearest neighbour sites * r * and * s * defined on a square lattice of @xmath8 sites with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the hamiltonian has a @xmath12 symmetry , associated with the mass conservation ( @xmath13 symmetry ) , times the ising @xmath14 symmetry between the even and odd checkerboard sublattices .",
    "the approximate gutzwiller monte carlo ( gmc ) @xcite approach is a numerical method built on the combination of both the gutzwiller ansatz and the classical monte carlo method with metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "this results in a semi - classical lattice field theory which preserves the @xmath13 symmetry , which is an advantage compared to some of the mean - field approaches conventionally used .",
    "this method also allows the reconstruction of correlation functions on a finite lattice cluster .",
    "the gutzwiller mean - field state takes the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the state with @xmath17 particles on site @xmath3 and where we introduced a cut - off @xmath18 on the number of particles per site .",
    "the ensemble @xmath19 of the complex @xmath20 coefficients is then sampled with the monte carlo method @xcite which is especially useful at finite temperature but can also be used in the low temperature regime .",
    "[ sec2_subc ]    the hamiltonian is also simulated by using the stochastic green function algorithm ( sgf ) @xcite , an exact quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) technique that allows simulations in the canonical ( ce ) or grand canonical ( gce ) ensembles of the system at finite temperatures , as well as measurements of many - particle green functions .",
    "we treat @xmath8 lattices with sizes up to @xmath21 and fix @xmath22 to set the energy scale .",

    "in addition to the sf and mi phases  for which @xmath47 as the populations are balanced in these phases  there is , therefore , the possibility of two other phases : a charge density wave ( cdw ) solid with vanishing coherence ( for integer or half - integer densities ) and a supersolid ( ss ) phase exhibiting both spatial ordering @xmath48 and phase coherence . in fig .",
    "[ figure_0 ] , we show @xmath41 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 as functions of the chemical potential , @xmath11 .",

    "[ figure_0 ] , we determined the phase diagrams in the @xmath52 plane for given values of @xmath53 ( see fig .",

    "@xcite , beyond @xmath58 , the nature of the phases change , as phases that show a density modulation are favoured ( fig .",

    "the mott phases are thus replaced with cdw phases . in the small @xmath7 limit",
    ", the mott phase at @xmath59 is replaced with a phase where , depending on the way the symmetry breaks , even ( odd ) sites are occupied by 2 bosons while odd ( even ) sites are empty .",
    "this is what we call a cdw ( 2,0 ) phase .",
    "the cdw phases at half - integer fillings are also affected .",
    "for example , the cdw ( 2,1 ) phase , i.e. having alternately doubly and singly occupied sites , observed at @xmath60 below @xmath61 is replaced with a ( 3,0 ) phase .",
    "the supersolid phase is also much larger as it surrounds completely the cdw lobes for @xmath62 .",

    "[ figure_3 ] .",
    "our results are similar to the phase diagrams of ref .",
    "we observe that the supersolid phase surrounds cdw phases , which means that it only appears for @xmath67 for integer densities ( as @xmath59 ) while it is present for smaller @xmath68 at half - integer densities .",
    "using qmc simulations in the canonical ensemble , we determine exactly the properties of the ground state .",

    "we observe the same features for all phase diagrams , with mostly quantitative differences between the qmc and the gmc predictions .",
    "the main difference is that the gmc technique generally overestimates the size of supersolid regions .",
    "for example , at @xmath69 the supersolid region is difficult to observe below @xmath70 as the transition lines marking the onset of density ordering and the disappearance of condensation appear superimposed in the limits of our simulations ( fig .",

    "the gmc and qmc phase diagrams are essentially the same but we observe a region where there seems to be a direct transition , without passing via an intermediate ss phase , between the sf and cdw ( 2,0 ) region ( fig .",

    "this confirms the presence of a direct first order transition from the sf to the cdw ( 2,0 ) in this region and the absence of a supersolid which then only exists for @xmath103 .",
    "as the interaction @xmath99 grows , for @xmath69 and @xmath60 , the ss region becomes narrower and eventually disappears .",
    "there is then a direct transition between sf and cdw ( 1,0 ) at @xmath69 and between sf and cdw ( 2,1 ) at @xmath60 .",

    "we believe these discrepancies to be due to the fact that we performed bulk simulations ( i.e. with no trap ) whereas the experiment takes place in a harmonic trap . however , the main point is that the existence of the supersolid phase observed in the experiment is confirmed .",

    "we also extended the phase diagram to other densities and confirmed predictions that were made using mean - field calculations @xcite .",
    "we also discussed the stability of the observed phases with respect to phase separation and found that the @xmath59 and @xmath66 supersolid phases are stable whereas the @xmath65 supersolid phase is not .",
