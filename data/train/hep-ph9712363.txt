    "then the neutrino can interact only with neutrons within its yukawa radius @xmath11 , and , if @xmath12 is sufficiently large , the dangerous many - body effects are exponentially damped .",
    "hereby , a lower bound for the electron neutrino mass , @xmath13  ev , was derived @xcite .    the method and results of ref .",
    "@xcite provoked some criticism .",
    "smirnov and vissani @xcite argued that a neutrino sea inside the neutron star @xcite reduces the potential energy @xmath1 because of pauli blocking .",
    "they stressed also that the behaviour of the potential energy @xmath1 , w^(2k)= ( -1)^k |w^(2k ) | , is unacceptable .",
    "in fact , both the increasing of @xmath14 and its oscillatory behaviour with @xmath15 are clear signs for the breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "_ @xcite recalculated the energy difference @xmath0 taking into account non - perturbatively the interaction of the neutrino with a uniform neutron background .",
    "they obtained @xmath16 if no neutrino sea is presented .",
    "this result would imply that neutrinos do not interact at all with the neutron background . in view of the results of ref . @xcite and the possible implications for neutrino physics",
    ", we feel it appropriate to recalculate once again @xmath0 . additionally , we estimate the neutrino pair creation rate of a neutron star caused by a density gradient of the background neutrons .    in our calculations",
    "we always assume that the neutron density @xmath17 respectively its gradient @xmath18 can be approximated locally by a constant value .",
    "this assumption looks unproblematic because of the macroscopic size of the neutron star , neglects however possible long - range effects due to massless neutrinos .",
    "the energy @xmath19 of a neutrino interacting with a classical background current @xmath20 of neutrons is given by @xcite e = p^0 = i^3 x 0 | ^(x ) _ t ( x)|0 _ j .",

    "moreover , the neutron number density @xmath25 is also nearly homogenous .",
    "therefore , the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ dg ] ) can still be characterized by the four - momentum @xmath26 of the neutrino .",
    "then , as it is well known , the only change compared to the vacuum case is the modification of the dispersion relation of the neutrino @xcite , e = ( m^2+|*p*|^2)^1/2 v [ disp ] v = - n_n . here , the upper sign in eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) corresponds to neutrinos and the lower sign to antineutrinos .",

    "the final integral can be done with the help of the residue theorem ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) and gives independently of the neutrino mass @xmath31 e = v -19  ev .",
    "this result could be expected in virtue of eq .",

    "since @xmath0 is the energy difference of one neutrino , we obtain the total contribution @xmath32 of neutrinos to the self - energy of a neutron star with radius @xmath33  km as m = r^3 n_e -42 . obviously , @xmath32 is negligible for a realistic value ( cf .",
    "next sections ) of the neutrino density @xmath34 .    finally , we want to comment on the possible source of error in the results of ref . @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the 8th order term of perturbation theory @xmath35 was used to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath36 is divergent and alternating , any result obtained in a finite order of perturbation theory is meaningless .",
    "by contrast , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the same non - perturbative method as we did .",
    "however , they made  as apparent from their eq .",
    "( 8)  the limit @xmath37 _ before _ integrating over @xmath38 .",
    "then , they argued that after regularization their @xmath39 integral vanishes due to the antisymmetry of the integrand .",
    "however , this is not true because of the presence of the factor @xmath40 .",
    "loeb proposed first that neutrinos with energies below @xmath41  ev are bounded inside neutron stars , while antineutrinos are repelled @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , this result follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) considering a neutron star as potential wall with depth @xmath42 and radius @xmath8 , and simply assuming that all the levels with energy @xmath43 $ ] are occupied .",
    "however , one should note that neutrino states with energy @xmath44 do not have an exponentially damped wave function for @xmath45 , and are resonances instead of true bound states .    to account for a possible neutrino sea inside an neutron star",
    ", we can apply either the imaginary or the real - time formalism of finite - temperature field theory .",
    "we use the latter since it is easier in this formalism to separate the medium from the vacuum effects",
    ". then the thermal neutrino propagator @xmath46 is given by s_f ( p , ) & = & p_l , [ thermo ] where @xmath47 is the inverse temperature and @xmath48 is the distribution function of the neutrinos .",
    "to simplify the notation , we have set @xmath49 . in the case of thermal equilibrium , @xmath48 is the fermi - dirac distribution function f_d ( p^0 ) = f_d , ( p^0 ) + f_d,| ( -p^0 ) = + .",
    "[ f_d ] note that the edge between particles and antiparticles is shifted by @xmath42 . inserting the thermal propagator into eq .",

    "finally , we want to remind that  as mentioned in the introduction  the results obtained in section 2 and 3 are only valid for an uniform neutron background , _",
    "i.e. _ in the limit of an infinite neutron star .",
    "let us consider in more detail the analogy between a neutron star and a potential wall .",
    "we keep now again the neutrino mass @xmath12 finite and consider dirac neutrinos .",
    "the limit for the electron neutrino mass is @xmath59  ev .",
    "hence the potential has no physical meaning , a more correct statement is that the potential difference @xmath60 is overcritical . ] @xmath61  ev is overcritical , @xmath62 , and therefore able to produce @xmath63-pairs at its interface . the quantity characterizing",
    "this process , @xmath64 , is not well - defined in the simple picture of the potential wall .",
    "we assume instead that @xmath17 can be approximated by @xmath65 .",
    "then we can treat locally the `` electric '' field @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , as uniform and derive the spontaneous neutrino pair creation rate due to a density gradient of the neutron background .",

    "but even if @xmath87  ev , the total luminosity @xmath88 is only = 2m_w v ~ 2.1 10 ^ 11 erg / s ( ) and has therefore practically no influence on the energy budget of the star .",
    "however , @xmath89-pair creation by neutron stars is probably the only case in the present universe that massive particles are spontaneously created and therefore it is interesting in its own .",
    "we have recalculated the energy of a neutrino in the uniform background of classical neutrons , both without and with a neutrino sea . in the first case",
    ", we found that the energy is changed by the small amount @xmath90  ev , in agreement with the well - known result of wolfenstein @xcite .",
    "moreover , the influence of a possible neutrino sea inside the neutron star has an even smaller effect on the neutrino energy .",
    "therefore , the contribution of neutrinos to the total energy of a neutron star seems to be negligible . however , to settle definitely the question if many - body effects become important in neutron stars it is necessary to calculate @xmath0 not only non - pertubatively but to take into account also the finite geometry of the star @xcite .",
