    "inaccessible web pages and `` 404 page not found '' responses are part of the web browsing experience . despite guidance for how to create `` cool uris '' that do not change @xcite there are many reasons why uris or even entire websites break @xcite .",
    "since web users frequently re - visit web pages @xcite a @xmath0 response constitutes a detriment to their browsing experience .",
    "however , we claim that information on the web is rarely completely lost , it is just missing . in whole or in part , content is often just moving from one uri to another .",
    "figure [ fig : content_mapping ] graphically explains this uri content mapping problem showing four scenarios with uris ( @xmath4 ) mapping to the same and to different content ( @xmath5 ) over time . furthermore figure [ fig : ht06 ] shows an example of a web page whose content has moved within a three year period .",
    "figure [ fig : ht06_1 ] shows the content of the original uri of the hypertext @xmath6 conference as displayed in 8/2009 .",
    "the original uri clearly does not hold conference related content anymore .",
    "our suspicion is that the website administrators did not renew the domain registration and therefore enabling someone else to take over .",
    "however , the content is not lost .",
    "the title of the original web page was _ acm hypertext 2006_. querying it against today s search engines results in discovering the content at its new uri .",
    "yahoo and bing return the new page top ranked and google returns it ranked fourth .",
    "figure [ fig : ht06_2 ] shows the content which is now available at a new uri .",
    "it is our intuition that major search engines like google , yahoo and msn live ( now bing ) , as members of what we call the web infrastructure ( wi ) , likely have crawled the content and possibly even stored a copy in their cache .",
    "therefore the content is not lost , it `` just '' needs to be rediscovered .",
    "the wi , explored in detail in @xcite , also includes non - profit archives such as the internet archive ( ia ) or the european archive as well as large - scale academic digital data preservation projects e.g. , citeseer and nsdl .",
    "it is our goal to utilize the wi for digital preservation and in particular for the rediscovery of missing web pages .",
    "therefore we need to explore the notion of the `` aboutness '' of the missing pages .",
    "lexical signatures ( lss ) haven been shown to be suitable for this purpose @xcite but they are expensive to generate since the inverse document frequency ( idf ) value needs to be acquired for each candidate term for example by querying search engines . in the worst case",
    "the cost is one query for each term . in this paper",
    "we investigate web pages titles as they intuitively describe the `` aboutness '' of a web page .",
    "other measures such as hashes @xcite and shingles @xcite have been introduced to capture and compare document s content but since we are utilizing search engines we need to leverage textual queries since that is the only format public search engine interfaces process .",
    "we can obtain titles of missing pages from search engine caches and the ia which means it ideally requires only one query per title .",
    "however , it implies that our method is only applicable for web pages ( html files ) with titles . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume all titles to be in a search engine s tolerance range for a search query .",
    "we are aware , however , that we obtain these web pages titles from third party institutions and the title text is often created by humans which both bares a certain risk regarding its correctness .",
    "we focus on the following four aspects of web pages titles : 1 ) their retrieval performance in terms of the rank of the uri of interest in the result set and the degree of similarity between the content of the top @xmath3 results and the content of the uri of interest ; 2 ) their evolution over time measured in edit distance ; 3 ) the correlation between the change of titles and the change of their page content and 4 ) a predictive model of a well performing title .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we see several aspects of future work for this body of research .",
    "so far we have conducted our experiments with randomly sampled pages from the open directory project meaning we used pages that are actually not missing .",
    "we are collaborating with several institutions such as the ia , the library of congress and the california digital library in order to generate an extensive corpus of missing web pages .",
    "we will apply our methods against this corpus and be able to benchmark their individual retrieval performance .",
    "we have shown statistics of how many uris have been re - discovered with titles and lss but a thorough investigation of what ( kind of ) uris were not discovered may reveal valuable information that will help improve the entire retrieval process .",
    "for example we would expect pages about specific and possibly abstract academic topics easier to rediscover than pages with very generic content that may even be used for search engine optimization techniques .    besides titles and lss",
    "we can think of various different methods to form potentially well performing search engine queries for our purpose .",
    "tags used to annotate web pages and lss based on the page neighborhood ( in- and out - links ) for example have been shown to be useful for web search .",
    "using tags and neighborhood based lss is the approach that has to be taken in case we can not locate any copies of the missing page neither in search engines caches nor in the ia .",
    "the uri can be used to query for tags and in- and out - links .",
    "lss consist of unigrams only but phrases or n - grams are promising for discovering similar pages .",
    "the performance evaluation of these methods remain for future work .",
    "we have investigated the performance of web pages titles for the purpose of rediscovering missing web pages by utilizing the web infrastructure .",
    "titles are commonplace and we have shown that they perform similarly well compared to lexical signatures with respect to the number of discovered uris returned top ranked .",
    "we did not address issues such as uri canonicalization in this work and hence we consider our retrieval results to be a lower bound . we have further analyzed the top @xmath3 results for all queries and found that regardless of whether the uri was discovered , potential uri aliases and duplicates were returned which also supports the argument that titles form well performing queries .",
    "we have used copies of pages from the internet archive to further confirm our intuition that titles decay over time .",
    "however , we have provided evidence that the content of web pages not only changes more quickly but also more significantly .",
    "hence we argue that titles can be a more robust method to rediscover missing pages .",
    "we have shown that not all titles are `` good titles '' , at least as determined by search suitability . with a thorough analysis of the composition of all titles in our data set we have provided a guideline to automatically identify titles predicted to perform poorly for our purpose .",
    "we have distilled a list of stop titles that indicate the title s retrieval quality .",
    "a major benefit of this process is that it can be done in real time .",
    "this work is supported in part by the library of congress ."
