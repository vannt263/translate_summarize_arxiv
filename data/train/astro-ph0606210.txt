    ", the anomalous emission line technique can also identify lenses with higher redshift , -emitting source galaxies @xcite . in practice",
    "this approach has been less productive because strong , high - redshift emitters are less numerous on the sky than moderate - redshift galaxies showing oxygen and balmer emission lines to the sdss line - flux limits , and the increase in lensing cross section with source redshift does not overcome this effect .",

    "the system was one of several single - line lens candidates selected from the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample of the sdss @xcite .",
    "these candidates were identified by subtracting best - fit galaxy spectrum templates from the sdss spectra of the lrgs , and then searching for significant ( @xmath15 ) residual emission .",

    "spectrum noise estimates were empirically rescaled in a manner similar to that of @xcite .",

    "candidates were subjected to several pruning steps to reject ( 1 ) unmodeled lrg rest - frame absorption / emission , ( 2 ) night - sky emission residuals , ( 3 ) spectra of very poor data quality , ( 4 ) line profiles narrower than the sdss spectral resolution , and ( 5 ) lines other than  as judged by multiple emission lines at the same redshift . in preparation for a single observing run",
