    "the full , non - factorized form of two - dimensional edgeworth expansion and the interpretation of its parameters is described in the handbook on mathematical statistics by kendall and stuart  @xcite .",
    "the first experimental evidence for oscillating behaviour in the two - particle correlation function has been observed by the na49 collaboration , unexpectedly , in the proton - proton correlations in central pb+pb collisions at cern sps  @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the oscillations has been explained with the help of the binary structure of the proton source in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we follow the lines of this presentation to explain the relationship between binary sources and oscillations in two - particle interferometry .",
    "binary sources appear generally : in astrophysics , in form of binary stars , in particle physics , in form of @xmath115 pairs , that separate before they decay to hadrons .",
    "let us consider first the simplest possible example , to see how the binary sources result in oscillations in the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac correlation function .",
    "suppose a source distribution @xmath116 describes , for example , a gaussian source centered on @xmath117 .",
    "consider a binary system , where the emission happens from @xmath118 with fraction @xmath119 , or from a displaced source , @xmath120 , centered on @xmath121 , with a fraction @xmath122 .",
    "for such a binary source , the amplitude of the emission is ( x ) = f_+ s(x - x_+ ) + f_- s(x - x_- ) , and the normalization requires f_+ + f_- = 1 the two - particle bose - einstein or fermi - dirac correlation function is c(q ) & = & 1 | ( q)|^2 = 1 ( q )    fermions .",
    "the oscillating pre - factor @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this factor is given as ( q ) = [ e : omega ] the strength of the oscillations is controlled by the relative strength of emission from the displaced sources and the period of the oscillations can be used to learn about the distance of the emitters . in the limit of one emitter ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 , or vice versa ) ,",
    "the oscillations disappear .    in particle physics",
    ", the effective separation between the sources can be estimated from the uncertainty relation to be @xmath128 fm .",
    "although this is much smaller , than the effective size of the pion source , 1 fm , one has to keep in mind that the back - to - back momenta of the @xmath129 pairs can be large , as compared to the pion mass .",
    "due to this boost , pions with similar momentum may be emitted from different @xmath130-s with a separation which is already comparable to the 1 fm hadronization scale , and the resulting oscillations may become observable .    in stellar astronomy ,",
    "the separation between the binary stars is typically much larger than the diameter of the stars , hence the oscillations are well measurable . in principle , similar oscillations may provide a tool to measure the separation of the @xmath131 from @xmath132 in 4-jet events at lep2 .",
    "the scale of separation of @xmath115 pairs is a key observable to estimate in a quantum - mechanically correct manner the influence of the bose - einstein correlations on the reconstruction of the @xmath130 mass .",
    "in heavy ion physics , oscillations are seen in the short range of the @xmath133 correlation function  @xcite , with a half - period of @xmath134 mev , in pb+pb reactions at cern sps measured by the na49 collaboration .",
    "proton - proton short - range correlations are strongly influenced not only by the fermi - dirac statistics but also by coulomb and strong final state interactions .",
    "this implies that the proton - proton correlation function of a binary proton source is approximately given by c^pp(q ) & & g(q ) [ 1 + ( q ) ( c_s^0,pp(q ) - 1 ) ] [ e : pposc ] where @xmath135 stands for the two - proton correlation function including only the effects of strong final state interactions for one component of the binary source , @xmath136 .",
    "this function @xmath137 can be evaluated similarly to the calculations performed for the conventional , one component , gaussian like sources , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , with the help of the proton - proton relative wave - function @xmath138 which deviates from a relative plane wave due to the strong final state interactions . in eq .",
    "( [ e : pposc ] ) , the binary nature of the source is represented by the oscillating pre - factor @xmath123 the columb final state interactions are represented in a small source size approximation by a conventional gamow penetration factor @xmath139 .",
    "the above approximation assumes that the strong final state interactions act on a scale that is smaller than the scale of separation of the binary proton source , hence the form of the oscillationg pre - factor @xmath123 is given by eq .",
    "( [ e : omega ] ) . the 30 mev half - period of the oscillations in na49 data implies a separation of @xmath140 fm , which is indeed much larger than the typical range of strong final state interactions .",
    "hence the oscillations in @xmath141 can be attributed to interference between the the two peaks of the na49 proton @xmath142 distribution  @xcite , separated by @xmath143 . as for the protons we have @xmath144 mev , we can identify this rapidity difference with the space - time rapidity difference between the two peaks of the rapidity distribution .",
    "the longitudinal scale of the separation is then given by @xmath145 , which can be used to estimate the mean freeze - out time of protons , @xmath146       \\approx 6.4 $ ] fm / c , in a good agreement with the average value of @xmath147 as extracted from the simultaneous analysis of the single - particle spectra and hbt radii in na44 , na49 and wa98 experiments in the buda - lund picture , as summarized in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath148 resonance is responsible for magnifying the structure of the two - proton correlation function at @xmath149 mev .",
    "this magnification makes the oscillations visible , in spite of their relatively large half period .",
    "another fortunate development in pb+pb collisions was that the @xmath142 distribution of the net baryon number ( protons ) developed two separate peaks , indicating perhaps the onset of nuclear transparency at 160 agev . at the smaller ags bombarding energies",
    ", the net baryon number has a single maximum at mid - rapidity which implies a very small , almost vanishing separation of the proton source into two effective components , that correspond to unobservably large period of oscillations , @xmath150 within the resolvable relative momentum range .",
    "the two - particle bose - einstein correlation function of the buda - lund hydro model ( bl - h ) was evaluated in ref.@xcite in a gaussian approximation , without applying the binary source formulation .",
    "an improved calculation was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the correlation function was evaluated using in the binary source formulation , and the corresponding oscillations were found .    using the exponential form of the @xmath151 $ ] factor",
    ", the bl - h emission function @xmath152 can be written as a sum of two terms : s_c(x,*k * ) & = & 0.5 [ s_+(x,*k * ) + s_-(x,*k * ) ] , + s_(x,*k * ) & = & , + f_b(x,*k * ) & = & , and @xmath153 for boltzmann , fermi - dirac or bose - einstein distributions .",
    "the above splitting is the basis of the binary source formulation of the bl - h parameterization .",
    "the effective emission function components are both subject to fourier - transformation in the bl approach . in an improved saddle - point approximation ,",
    "the two components @xmath154 and @xmath155 can be fourier - transformed independently , finding the separate maxima ( saddle point ) @xmath156 and @xmath157 of @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and performing the analytic calculation for the two components separately .",
    "these oscillations in the intensity correlation function are similar to the oscillations in the intensity correlations of photons from binary stars in stellar astronomy  @xcite .",
    "note that the oscillations are expected to be small in the bl - h picture , and the gaussian remains a good approximation to the becf but with modified radius parameters .",
    "the buda - lund hydro parameterization ( bl - h ) was invented in the same paper as the bl parameterization of the bose - einstein correlation functions  @xcite , but in principle the general bl forms of the correlation function do not depend on the hydrodynamical ansatz ( bl - h ) .",
    "the bl - h two - particle bose - einstein correlation function is evaluated in the binary source formalism in ref .",
    "@xcite : c_2(*k*_1,*k*_2 ) = 1 + _ * e^- q_^2 _ ^2 - q_=^2 _",
    "= ^2 - q_^2 _ ^2 , where the pre - factor @xmath158 induces oscillations within the gaussian envelope as a function of @xmath83 .",
    "this oscillating pre - factor satisfies @xmath159 and @xmath125 .",
    "this factor is given as & = & ^2 ( q _ _ ) + & & .",
    "the invariant bl decomposition of the relative momentum is utilized to present the correlation function in the simplest possible form . although the shape of the becf is non - gaussian , because the factor @xmath160 results in oscillations of the correlator , the result is still explicitely boost - invariant .",
    "although the source is assumed to be cylindrically symmetric , we have 6 free fit parameters in this bl form of the correlation function : @xmath52 , @xmath79 , @xmath86 , @xmath81 , @xmath53 and @xmath161 .",
    "the latter two control the period of the oscillations in the correlation function , which in turn carries information on the separation of the effective binary sources .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of the oscillating factor in the bl bose - einstein correlation function .    due to the analytically found oscillations , the presented form of the becf goes beyond the single gaussian version of the saddle - point calculations of ref .",
    "this result goes also beyond the results obtainable in the ykp or the bp parameterizations . in principle",
    ", the binary - source saddle - point calculation gives more accurate analytic results than the numerical evaluation of space - time variances , as the binary - source calculation keeps non - gaussian information on the detailed shape of the bose - einstein correlation function .",
    "the parameters of the spectrum and the correlation function are the same , given in more details in ref .",
    "hence the simultaneous analysis of the two - particle correlations and the single - particle spectra , advocated already in refs .",
    "@xcite , yields a rather precise picture of particle production . without the oscillations , it is possible to determine only the means and the variances of the density , flow and temperature profiles of the particle source . by taking into account the oscillations , additional information about the separation of the source into an effective binary structure can also be established .",
    "one of the new directions in two - particle quantum statistical correlation studies is to search for non - gaussian structures .",
    "an important observation is that particle interferometry for binary sources predicts the existence of oscillations in the two - particle bose - einstein or fermi - dirac correlation functions .",
    "intensity correlations oscillate , if the sources are binary , and the separation of the binary sources is related to the period of the oscillations .",
    "novel model - independent tools to search for such oscillatory patters are the edgeworth or the laguerre expansion techniques .",
    "the frequency of oscillations in the two - proton correlation function in pb + pb collisions at cern sps has been explained in terms of the bl - h model as a consequence of the separation of the proton sources in this reaction .",
    "more work is required to work out the greater details of oscillatiory patterns in two - particle bose - einstein correlations .",
