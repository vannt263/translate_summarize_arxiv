    "measuring the quasilocal energy in general relativity is an extremely important but a long eluding problem .",
    "there is an ambiguity in calculating this energy as due to its nonlinear nature and the fact that gravitational energy is non - localizable .",
    "the best method for measuring gravitational energy has been proposed by the brown and york in @xcite by employing the hamilton - jacob theory for gravitation .",
    "this method has been studied extensively in general relativity for static spacetime with spherical symmetry and also for kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been generalized the brown - york formalism to all orders in lovelock gravity and have been verified the conjunction for pure lovelock black hole @xcite . motivated by this research , we investigate the evolution of this energy during the birth and growth of lovelock gravity in a system of m0-branes . in our model , m0-branes join to each other and form universe and anti - universe which are connected by a wormhole .",
    "this system is named bion . by considering the changes in brown - york energy",
    ", we can predict the evolution of lovelock gravity in a bionic system .",
    "this can help us predict phenomenological events which are emerged due to dynamical structure of lovelock gravity in our universe .    in previous work ,",
    "bion model @xcite has been used in cosmology to consider the evolution of universe from birth and then inflation to late time acceleration .",
    "for example , in one paper , k black fundamental strings link to each other and construct a bion @xcite .",
    "coincidence with the birth of bion , a universe and an anti - universe are born which are connected with each other through a wormhole @xcite .",
    "this wormhole dissolves in branes and causes their expansion . in another work ,",

    ". then , m0-branes glue to each other and build a pair of an m5 and an anti - m5-brane .",
    "this pair decays to an m3-brane , an anti - m3-brane in additional to one m2-brane .",
    "our universe is formed on one of these m3-branes and m2 has the role of wormhole . in this theory ,",

    "our universe is built on d3-brane and d1-branes dissolve in universe and lead to inflation and late time acceleration @xcite .",
    "now , a natural question arises to how can we consider the evolution of bion in four dimensional universe ?",
    "we answer it by measuring the brown - york energy which changes by changing the lovelock gravity in this system . in our consideration , first m0-branes join to each other and build an m3 , an anti - m3 and an m2-brane which connects them .",

    "the square energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states are produced . to remove these states , m3 compacts ,",
    "the sign of compacted gravity changes and the anti - gravity emerges which leads to getting away of branes from each other and contraction of universe . in this epoch , the brown - york energy decreases and shrinks to zero .",

    "the last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we show that the relevant action of mp - branes can be obtained by summing over the actions of p m0-branes . then , we obtain the brown - york energy in a system of m2-m3 branes . in this system , universes are placed on m3-branes and connect with each other via an m2-brane .",
