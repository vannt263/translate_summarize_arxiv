    "the simplest of the many - body kaonic nuclear system is the @xmath13 , which has had much attention theoretically .",
    "because the @xmath14 resonance is interpreted as a quasi - bound state of the @xmath15 system in the @xmath16 continuum  @xcite , one expects a quasi - bound @xmath13 system driven by the attractive @xmath15 interaction in the isospin @xmath4 channel .",
    "various approaches have resulted in a rather general consensus that the quasi - bound state is obtained above the @xmath17 threshold and the width is larger than the binding  @xcite .",

    "while the large width of the @xmath14 is responsible for the large width of the @xmath13 state , the analogous state @xmath0 , where the @xmath3 plays the role of the @xmath14 in the @xmath13 state , has much better chances to survive as a long lived and observable state .",

    "this is partly because of the small transition coupling which is suppressed by the exchange of the heavy flavor , but the main reason is the suppression of the phase space due to the large binding energy . in this sense ,",
    "the heaviness of the @xmath7 meson is essential to realize the deep and narrow @xmath0 quasi - bound state .",
    "the very narrow width of the @xmath0 system is qualitatively different to the @xmath127 one where the width was so large as to make its experimental observation unfeasible . in the present case",
    "there is a clear situation and there are no problems in principle for the observation of the state . in the fca calculation , we observe that the two - nucleon absorption width is larger than the three - body decay width .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath0 quasi - bound state can be more easily seen in the two - baryon final states such as @xmath278 .",

    "one would expect several thousand events per day for the background of the proposed reaction @xcite",

    "we have studied the @xmath0 system with @xmath1 and have found that the system is bound and rather stable , with a width of about 20 - 40 mev .",
    "we obtained a clear signal of the quasi - bound state for the total spin @xmath106 channel around 3500 mev .",
    "we have used two methods for the evaluation of the quasi - bound state .",
    "the first one used the fixed center approximation for the faddeev equations and the second one employs the variational approach with hadronic potentials in coordinate space .",
    "the @xmath2 interaction was constructed in the field theoretical method with channel couplings and a unitary approach dynamically generates the @xmath277 resonance as a @xmath2 quasi - bound state .    in both cases ,",
    "we have found a bound state with an energy around 3500 mev in the @xmath106 channel .",
    "this corresponds to 250 mev binding from the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the @xmath108 channel is more subtle , and the precise @xmath2 amplitude in the @xmath23 channel is important for a robust prediction in this channel .",
    "the mesonic decay width of the quasi - bound state turned out to be less than 40 mev .",
    "in addition , the @xmath7 absorption on two nucleons was evaluated in the fca formalism using a novel method .",
    "although the absorption process adds several tens of mev to the width , the total width is still much smaller than the binding energy .",
    "it is found that the @xmath2 pair in @xmath4 channel in the @xmath0 system resembles the wave function of the @xmath28 state in vacuum .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 state found here can be interpreted as a quasi - bound state of @xmath28 and a nucleon .",
    "the small width of the @xmath0 quasi - bound state is advantageous for the experimental identification .",
