    "we exploited the differential time - resolved multi - colour photometry of a selected field of ngc  884 presented in ( * ? ? ? * saesen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) .",
    "the photometry was gathered at 12  sites using 15  different instruments and resulted in almost 77500  ccd images and 92  hours of photo - electric data .",
    "the data span three observation seasons ( 2005  2007 ) and the resulting precision of the light curves of the brighter stars is 5.7  mmag in @xmath1 , 6.9  mmag in @xmath2 , 5.0  mmag in @xmath3 and 5.3  mmag in @xmath4 .",
    "we identified 75  periodic b - stars through an automated frequency analysis in the @xmath1 filter and focus on these stars in the current study .",
    "we derived effective temperature and luminosity values from absolute photometry in the seven geneva filters and we combined them with literature values to get the position of the b - stars in the hr - diagram .",
    "we performed a detailed frequency analysis with period04 ( * ? ? ? * ( lenz & breger 2005 ) ) .",
    "we used a weighted and non - weighted frequency analysis for the @xmath1 light curve , and only a weighted analysis for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we considered a peak significant if it has a signal - to- noise ratio above 4 .",
    "a classical prewhitening scheme was adopted to determine all significant frequencies present in a certain star . as a result",
    ", we keep 65  periodic b - stars of which 36  are mono - periodic , 16  are bi - periodic , 10  are tri - periodic , 2  are quadru - periodic and one star has 9  independent frequencies .",
    "the results of the multi - frequency fits in the different colours are presented in table 4 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* saesen et al . ( 2013 ) ) .    since none of the detected frequencies show any phase differences in the different filters , we restricted for the mode identification to the photometric amplitude ratios to determine the degree @xmath5 , following the method of dupret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . for each pulsator",
    ", we selected stellar equilibrium models that fitted the observed position in the hr - diagram within a 2@xmath6-error box .",
    "we then selected for each model and each degree @xmath5 between 0 and 4 the theoretical frequencies that fit the observed ones , taking into account rotational splitting .",
    "we confronted the theoretical amplitude ratios with those observed and made a mode identification by eliminating the degrees for which the theoretical amplitude ratios do not match the observed ones .",
    "we securely identified the degree for 12 of the 114 detected frequencies .",
    "for the following analyses , we exclude three stars : one ellipsoidal binary and two non - member @xmath7  sct stars .",
    "all other 62  b - stars can be considered members of ngc  884 based on photometric diagrams and membership studies in the literature .",
    "we did not find a correlation between the projected rotational velocity and the amplitude or frequency of the modes .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations , however , decrease as the frequency values increase . a comparison between the observed and theoretical frequency - radius relation allowed us to identify eight @xmath0  cep stars in our sample , namely oo  2246 , oo",
    "2299 , oo  2444 , oo  2488 , oo  2520 , oo  2572 , oo  2601 and oo  2694 .",
    "the seismic properties of the selected @xmath0  cep stars were confronted with those predicted for a dense full grid of stellar models ( * ? ? ? * ( briquet et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "we searched for a consistent cluster solution by requesting common cluster parameters , i.e. , equal age and initial chemical composition , without specifying their values .",
    "we eliminated models based on the observed position of the stars in the hr - diagram and the observed frequency spectrum , allowing for rotational splitting in the first - order approximation . imposing the identified degrees and measured frequencies of the radial , dipole and quadrupole modes of five @xmath0 cep stars led to a seismic cluster age estimate of @xmath8 .",
    "this is fully compatible with the age estimate obtained from modeling of an eclipsing binary in the cluster ( @xmath9 , ( * ? ? ? * southworth et al .",
    "2004 ) ) and illustrates the valuable alternative that cluster asteroseismology can offer for age determinations .",
    "for more information , we refer the interested reader to * ? ? ? * ."
