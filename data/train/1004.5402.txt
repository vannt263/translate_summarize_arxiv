    "the observed c  iv @xmath0@xmath01548 - 51 doublet was blueshifted by 190@xmath4 ( section  [ rv ] ) , then compared to the calculated profiles .",
    "the code adopts a standard @xmath22-law to describe the acceleration of the stellar wind , and includes a turbulence parameter , @xmath23 ( typically expressed as a fraction of @xmath1 ) , to account for stochastic deviations from the velocity prescription .",
