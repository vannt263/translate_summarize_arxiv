    "ly@xmath0  is the only emission line that we can detect in the highest redshift ( @xmath12 ) galaxies , making it the only probe of the internal structure of these galaxies and one of the few diagnostic tools for studying the intergalactic gas .",
    "however , separating the internal and external effects will always be difficult at these redshifts .",
    "thus , to determine the intrinsic ly@xmath0  properties of galaxies , we need to study lower redshift samples where the galaxy structure can be separated from the effects of the intergalactic medium .    recently , substantial samples of @xmath13 ly@xmath0  emitters ( laes ) and a small number of @xmath10 laes have been found with the _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex _ ; martin et al .",
    "2005 ) grism spectrographs .",
    "the pipeline extractions for the grism spectrographs provide spectra to a fixed limiting near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) magnitude that can be searched for ly@xmath0  emission lines ( deharveng et al .",
    "2008 ; cowie et al .",
    "the procedure enables the selection of a substantial sample of sources that can be compared to the high - redshift laes . since the selection process is based on finding ly@xmath0  in the uv - continuum selected _ galex _ sources , it is most analogous to locating laes in the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) population using spectroscopy ( e.g. , shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the advent of these low - redshift lae catalogs has been very exciting , and many follow - up papers have been written ( e.g. , finkelstein et al .  2009a , 2009b ; atek et al .",
    "2009 ; scarlata et al .  2009 ; cowie et al .",
    "however , because the _ galex _ grism pipeline only includes objects whose uv continuum magnitudes are bright enough to generate measurable continuum spectra , only a fraction of the emission - line objects at these redshifts are detected .",
    "in particular , strong emitters with high equivalent widths ( ews ) may have emission lines that are detectable but continuum magnitudes that fall below the continuum threshold .",
    "moreover , because the samples have both a continuum and an emission - line selection , it is not straightforward to compute the lae luminosity functions ( see the extensive discussions in deharveng et al .",
    "2008 and cowie et al .",
    "thus , ad hoc assumptions about the invariance of the ew distribution as a function of continuum magnitude need to be made , even though they may not be correct .    fortunately , it is possible to detect directly the excluded emitters by re - extracting the _ galex _ data . in this paper",
    ", we show how to find `` orphan '' emission lines ( e.g. , straughn et al .",
    "2008 ; keel et al .",
    "2009 ) and how to generate a flux - limited ly@xmath0  emission - line sample .",
    "we refer to this approach as a data cube search .",
    "first , we extract a spectrum for every spatial pixel in the _ galex _ fields .",
    "next , we form a three - dimensional data cube , analogous to that produced by an integral field unit , with two spatial axes and a third wavelength axis . finally , we search the wavelength slices in these data cubes for emitters .",
    "an alternative procedure is to use the deep broadband _",
    "galex _ images to develop a target list of galaxies fainter than those used in the pipeline and then to extract the spectra of these objects .",
    "however , since this approach still introduces a pre - selection ( which must be included and modeled in any interpretation and may omit extreme ew emitters ) , we prefer to use the data cube approach .    in order to fully understand the laes that we find",
    ", we need a wealth of ancillary data .",
    "in particular , the key requirement is as extensive a set of redshift measurements as possible .",
    "thus , for this paper , we focus on the intensively studied _",
    "deep field south ( cdfs ; giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) region , where we can use both existing optical spectroscopy to confirm the uv identifications of the ly@xmath0  line and deep x - ray data to identify active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . in section  [ choice ] , we describe the rich ancillary data on the cdfs . in section",
    "[ technical ] , we detail our data cube search methodology and use it to extract a sample of laes at @xmath10",
    ". we also use simulations to estimate the completeness with which we can detect emitters of a given flux . in section  [ newlae ]",
    ", we present the properties of the 28 new @xmath10 laes that we found in our data cube search .",
    "we make use of the ancillary data to test the reliability of the laes and their uv redshifts and to get a first estimate of the agn contamination . in section  [ disc ] , we present our discovery of a giant ly@xmath0blob .",
    "we also compute the @xmath10 lae luminosity function , which we compare with lae luminosity functions at lower and higher redshifts . in section  [ summary ] , we summarize our results .",
    "we use a standard @xmath14  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 cosmology throughout .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab magnitude system .",
    "the four deepest nuv grism observations ( cdfs-00 , 353  ks ; groth-00 , 291  ks ; ngpdws-00 , 165  ks ; cosmos-00 , 140  ks ) correspond to some of the most intensively studied regions in the sky . in this paper , we use the central @xmath17 by @xmath17 region ( centered on right ascension @xmath18 and declination @xmath19 in j2000 coordinates ) of the cdfs-00 for a pilot study to show the power of the data cube method .",
    "this region is extremely rich in ancillary information .",
    "for example , it contains the _ hst _ acs great observatories origins deep survey - south ( goods - s ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) subregion , where there are more than 3000 spectroscopic redshifts in a 140  arcmin@xmath20 area ( le fvre et al .",

    "2004 ) provide the galaxy morphologies and spectral energy distributions from the rest - frame far - uv ( fuv ) to the mid - infrared for a substantial fraction of the objects . finally , the 4  ms _ chandra _ image of the cdfs ( luo et al .",

    "2011 ) and the extended cdfs ( ecdfs ; lehmer et al .  2005 ;",
    "virani et al .",
    "2006 ) fields can be used to help eliminate agns .",
    "a number of optical spectroscopic surveys have specifically targeted the x - ray sources in these fields ( szokoly et al .",
    "2004 ; treister et al .",
    "2009 ; silverman et al .",
    "the 50  cm _ galex _ telescope contains a selectable caf2 75  g  mm@xmath6 grism , which provides slitless spectroscopy over the whole _ galex",
    "_ 1.25  deg diameter field - of - view .",
    "the grism is optimized for order  2 in the fuv channel ( @xmath23   ) and for order  1 in the nuv channel ( @xmath24   ) .",
    "the resolution is roughly 10    in the fuv ( r=200 ) and 25    in the nuv ( r=90 ) , though the exact resolution depends on both the wavelength and the spatial extent of the target ( morrissey et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the pipeline extractions of the _ galex _ grism data are described in chapter  6 of the _ galex _ technical documentation and in the _ galex _ grism primer ( http://www.galex.caltech.edu/researcher/grism/primer.html ) .",
    "the pipeline produces spectral images for each individual exposure , together with extracted one- and two - dimensional spectra from the combined exposures for all of the objects in the field down to a limiting nuv magnitude where the signal - to - noise of the continuum spectrum becomes low .    in the first stage of the _ galex _",
    "grism reductions , the photons are processed in the same way as they are in the direct broadband images , and astrometrically corrected and registered whole field spectral images of the intensity and system response are created .",
    "these individual spectral images , with an average exposure time of about a thousand seconds , have been taken at a wide range of grism rotations .",
    "for the long total exposures of fields like the cdfs-00 , there are several hundred such individual spectral images .",
    "we begin our own data reductions from these spectral images .      the slitless nature of the grism data results in spectral overlaps between neighboring objects .",
    "however , because each of the spectral images is taken at a different rotation angle , overlaps can be removed .",
    "objects only overlap with a given neighbor at one orientation , and so in the multiple spectral images , the signal associated with a given object can be picked out from the occasional contamination .",
    "the grism data are often portrayed as a `` propellor image '' , where images at many grism angles are added together , as shown in figure  [ propellor ] .",
    "this type of image is extremely useful for visualizing our present _ galex",
    "_ grism extraction process .",
    "each pixel ( x , y ) on the spectral image corresponds to a specified position in right ascension and declination . at a given orientation , the grism spectrum corresponding to that pixel runs at that angle relative to the central position .",
    "the zeroth order lies to the negative side , while the higher orders lie to the positive side .",
    "thus , for intensively observed fields with large numbers of independent spectral images , we can form a four - dimensional data cube ( xbyybythe number of wavelength elementsbythe number of spectral images ) .",
    "the number of x and y pixels corresponds to the total number of spatial pixels in the grism image ( here 2000 by 2000 ) , and we hereafter refer to the number of spectral images as nn .",
    "0.4 cm        a given wavelength corresponds to a circular annulus ( large circle in figure  [ propellor ] ) , the spokes of which correspond to the grism angles .",
    "a given emission line will occur at these specified positions in the suite of images with varying grism angles ( e.g. , keel et al .",
    "if we construct a vector of values , only the object itself appears in all the elements .",
    "other objects occur as random contamination in single elements of the vector .",
    "thus , we can mask out pixels on the individual spectral images where we expect contamination from bright neighboring galaxies .",
    "we can further remove contamination from fainter objects by using a clipped average to determine the true signal . in doing so",
    ", we can collapse the four - dimensional data cube to a three - dimensional data cube ( xbyybythe number of wavelength elements ) .",
    "this final three - dimensional data cube is analogous to the data cube that would be obtained with a scanning imaging spectrometer or with an integral - field spectrograph where each spatial pixel has a spectrum associated with it . for most spatial pixels",
    ", there is no significant continuum flux or emission lines in the spectrum ( the third axis ) .",
    "we may also view the three - dimensional data cube as a sequence of narrowband images , stepping in wavelength , each of which may be searched for emitters .",
    "it is in this way that we form our emission - line selected sample .",
    "we created a pipeline to convert the nuv and fuv spectral images into four - dimensional data cubes .",
    "we chose a wavelength step of 5    for the nuv output cube in order to oversample the roughly 20     wavelength resolution .",
    "we chose the wavelength range ( @xmath25   ) to cover the 25% response range of the nuv grism .",
    "this gives 160 wavelength elements .    in forming the four - dimensional data cubes ( xbyyby160bynn ) , we wanted to maintain the statistical independence of the pixels .",
    "thus , in assigning to each ( x , y , @xmath26 ) a vector ( the fourth axis ) , we need to be concerned with the fact that we are oversampling the spectral images in wavelength . to avoid averaging",
    ", we decided to assign to each ( x , y , @xmath26 ) position in a given spectral image ( recall that each position will have nn values since there are nn spectral images ) the nearest neighbor pixel using the grism angle from the _ galex _ pipeline .",
    "note that the _ galex _ pipeline computes the grism angle by fitting to the spectra of bright objects in the field . to maintain the statistical independence of the pixels",
    ", we will only assign each pixel in a given spectral image once , so since we are oversampling the spectral images in wavelength , this means that some of the pixels in the fourth axis are blank .",
    "these blank pixels are ignored hereafter .    at this point , we collapsed the fourth axis by forming the median , comparing each value in the fourth axis with the median , and eliminating points that deviate from the median by more than @xmath27 .",
    "we formed an exposure time - weighted average from the remaining points to give the final signal at this ( x , y , @xmath26 ) pixel in the three - dimensional data cube .",
    "we used an identical procedure for the fuv processing , except here we chose a wavelength step of 2.5    over the wavelength range @xmath28   , giving 160 wavelength elements .",
    "also , because of the low background photon detection rate per pixel in the fuv , and because contamination is much less of a problem in the fuv , we formed a simple average rather than a median for comparison with each value in the fourth axis .",
    "we eliminated points that deviated from the average by more than @xmath27 .",
    "then , as we did for the nuv processing , we formed an exposure time - weighted average of the clipped vector to obtain the final signal at this ( x , y , @xmath26 ) pixel in the three - dimensional data cube .",
    "for the present emission - line search , we are not interested in the objects with brighter continua whose spectra are already included in the existing _ galex _ pipeline data products . we also want to minimize any contamination from these brighter galaxies and stars in the final three - dimensional data cube .",
    "we therefore masked out the spectral region in each _ galex _ spectral image that corresponded to a pixel with a surface brightness in excess of 25.8  mag  arcsec@xmath29 in the nuv continuum image of the field smoothed with a 2 pixel boxcar smoothing .",
    "this removes all objects with nuv magnitudes brighter than 20.4 and no objects with nuv magnitudes fainter than 21.25 .",
    "this faint magnitude bound is considerably brighter than the magnitude limit of the pipeline sample , so we only eliminate objects that already have spectra and hence already have been searched for ly@xmath0  lines .",
    "( the remaining objects that are already present in the pipeline sample are eliminated later in the process ; see section  [ searchdatacubes ] . )",
    "none of our results are sensitive to the precise choice of the masking surface brightness threshold .    in figure  [ slice_sample ] ( left panel ) , we show a typical portion of a wavelength `` slice '' ( a 40    region obtained by summing eight of the 5    steps ; see section  [ searchdatacubes ] ) in the final data cube compared to ( right panel ) the corresponding nuv continuum image .",
    "the positions in the final data cube that correspond to the regions that were masked appear white in the wavelength slice image .",
    "10901 spatial pixels are eliminated by the masking , or just under @xmath30 of the spatial area covered by the three - dimensional data cube .      with the three - dimensional data cube in hand",
    ", we can now carry out a search for emission - line objects .",
    "we first divided each 5    wavelength slice in the data cube by the grism effective area at that wavelength to take out response variations .",
    "we used the values given in http://galexgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/galex/documents .",
    "we then formed forty 20    ( in order to roughly match the resolution element ) narrowband slices from the nuv data cube .",
    "for each slice , we subtracted the average of slices on either side of the primary slice , n. we used slices n@xmath31 to n@xmath32 and slices n@xmath33 to n@xmath34 to form this average .",
    "the background subtraction removes most of the residual structure and most of the continuum objects in the field , as we see by comparing the left panel of figure  [ slice_sample ] with the upper - right panel of figure  [ image_slice ] .",
    "this will retain any emitter whose width is less than about 240   .",
    "even broad - line agns satisfy this criterion , so we should not be eliminating any objects by this process .    from the left panel of figure  [ slice_sample ] , we can see residual regions around the small number of very bright sources that were masked , and these can cause contamination .",
    "thus , in each of the 40 slices , we masked out additional spatial regions around these bright sources . for sources with nuv magnitudes brighter than 14 , we masked a @xmath35 radius region around the source , and for sources with nuv magnitudes brighter than 17 , we masked a @xmath36 radius region .",
    "we searched each slice for objects with surface brightnesses of at least @xmath37  photons  @xmath5  s@xmath6 per @xmath38 spatial pixel using a 4 pixel spatially smoothed version of the slice .",
    "the smoothing roughly matches the @xmath39 spatial resolution in the _ galex _ nuv band .",
    "the surface brightness cut was chosen empirically to provide the maximum depth while not generating an unmanageably large number of spurious sources that have to be eliminated by hand .",
    "bright emitters may appear in more than one slice , and we formed our preliminary catalog by merging all of the emitters found in neighboring slices . as a consequence of the background subtraction process , we only cover a wavelength range of 2030 to 2630   , which corresponds to a redshift range for ly@xmath0  of @xmath1 . at this stage ,",
    "any objects already in the pipeline sample were removed .",
    "we created the one - dimensional spectra directly from the three - dimensional data cube using a @xmath40 spatial pixel box together with a local background subtraction .",
    "we flux calibrated by matching to the nuv magnitude of the object .",
    "we visually inspected each of the narrowband slices and the one - dimensional spectrum of each selected object and eliminated objects that were artifacts , such as remaining edge effects from the brighter objects or objects with stellar spectra , to form our primary catalog .",
    "the initial selection yielded 161 objects , of which we retained 28 .",
    "for each of the 28 objects , we also created a two - dimensional spectral image from which we could extract final one - dimensional spectra . for doing the extractions",
    ", we created our own version of the _ galex _ pipeline .",
    "the only difference between our version of the pipeline and the standard pipeline is that we used a profile - weighted spectral extraction to form the one - dimensional spectra ( horne 1986 ) .",
    "as we illustrate in figure  [ galex ] , we obtained some slight improvements in signal - to - noise from the profile weighting ( about a factor of 1.3 ) , which is helpful in dealing with weak features , such as the faint ly@xmath0  emission lines .",
    "( note that the source shown in figure  [ galex ] was from the pipeline sample rather than from our data cube sample . )",
    "0.4 cm                                in figure  [ spectralimages ] , we show the two - dimensional nuv spectral images of our 28 new @xmath41 laes , ordered according to table  [ faint_z1_sample_table ] ( see section  [ newlae ] ) , along with their fuv and nuv continuum images ( shown to the far - left and left of each spectral image , respectively ) . in figure",
    "[ spect ] , we show the one - dimensional spectra that we extracted from these .",
    "we performed the final flux calibration using the given _",
    "galex _ spectral response .",
    "we decided that using the one - dimensional spectra formed from our version of the pipeline software rather than the one - dimensional spectra obtained from the data cube would enable us to make the most direct comparison with brighter emitters in the field , since their spectra had been formed from the pipeline software .",
    "as a bonus , it would also provide an independent confirmation of the emission - line selection . in figure  [ spec_comp ] , we compare the one - dimensional spectra formed in the two different ways using two of the emitters . despite the very different procedures used , the two methods produce spectra that agree well in shape and normalization .",
    "for each of the 28 objects , we checked that the discovered line was not clearly another line rather than ly@xmath0  by using the combined fuv and nuv spectra .",
    "for the spectrum shown in figure  [ galex ] , the discovered line was not ly@xmath0 , but as we noted above , this object was from the pipeline sample rather than from our data cube sample .",
    "all of the lines in our data cube sample appear to be ly@xmath0 .",
    "we measured the redshifts , the ly@xmath0  fluxes , and the line widths by fitting a gaussian to the primary line in each spectrum .",
    "since , in general , the continua are faint in the spectra , we obtained the ews of the lines by dividing the measured ly@xmath0  flux by the continuum flux measured from the broadband nuv continuum image .",
    "we also made a classification of whether the emitter was definitely an agn based on the presence of high - excitation emission lines in its uv spectrum , or whether it could be a star - forming galaxy ( see , e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "our candidate star - forming galaxy sample will still contain some remaining agns , so optical spectra and/or x - ray imaging data are needed to make a final determination of whether a galaxy is , in fact , star - forming .",
    "because of the low spatial and spectral resolution of the _ galex _ grism data , the emitters almost all appear as unresolved objects in the narrowband slices or in the two - dimensional spectral images ( figure  [ spectralimages ] ) .",
    "the one exception to this is galex033246 - 274154 , which is clearly extended . in figure  [ slice_images]a",
    ", we show a contoured image ( black ) of a typical emitter , and in figure  [ slice_images]b , we show a similar image for galex033246 - 274154 . in both panels , we also show the point spread function contours formed from the average of the three brightest sources in the sample ( red ) .",
    "there is a clear distinction between the two panels . in order",
    "to be spatially resolved , the object must be very extended .",
    "thus , we shall interpret galex033246 - 274154 as a ly@xmath0  blob in the discussion section .",
    "since nearly all the emitters in our sample are unresolved , it is relatively straightforward to estimate the completeness with which we can detect emitters of a given flux , since we do not need to consider morphological or size differences .",
    "in addition , since the observed - frame equivalent widths of the objects are large compared to the spectral resolution , the emission - line peaks have a high contrast with the continuum level ( figure  [ spect ] ) .",
    "thus , the selection depends only on the emission - line flux and not on the continuum level , or , as a corollary , on the equivalent width .    in order to estimate the completeness",
    ", we added in 3000 objects ( one hundred emitters in each of the thirty narrowband slices ) of a specified flux with shapes corresponding to the spatial point spread function measured using bright objects in the data cube .",
    "the emitters were added into the data cube at random spatial positions and uniformly distributed through the narrowband slices .",
    "we then ran our standard selection procedure and found the number of recovered objects . at fluxes above @xmath4  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath6",
    ", our selection is more than @xmath3 complete , but it drops extremely rapidly below this value ( see figure  [ complete ] ) .",
    "we shall use this in calculating the ly@xmath0  luminosity function .     -0.4",
    "in table  [ faint_z1_sample_table ] , we summarize the properties of the 28 new @xmath10 laes in the cdfs-00 found in our data cube search . these are all objects that were not present in the pipeline sample . in column  1",
    ", we give the _ galex _ name ; in columns  2 and 3 , the j2000 right ascension and declination ; in columns  4 and 5 , the nuv and fuv ab magnitudes ; in column  6 , the redshift from the _ galex _ uv spectrum ; in column  7 , the ly@xmath0  fluxes with @xmath42 errors ; in column  8 , the logarithm of the ly@xmath0   luminosity ; in column  9 , the rest - frame ew(ly@xmath0 ) with @xmath42 errors ; in column  10 , an entry of `` agn '' , if the source is classified as an agn based on its uv spectrum ; in column  11 , the logarithm of the @xmath43  kev flux , if the source is detected in the extended cdfs , or an entry of `` ecdfs '' , if the source is in the ecdfs region but is not detected ; in column  12 , the optical ground - based redshift ; and in column  13 , the optical spectral classification .",
    "we measured the nuv and fuv ab magnitudes in @xmath44 diameter apertures centered on the emitter positions .",

    "the @xmath42 errors obtained by measuring magnitudes at random positions in the images are 26.0 for the nuv and 26.7 for the fuv .",

    "the quantity in column  5 is the magnitude corresponding to the absolute value of the flux with a minus sign in front to indicate that the flux was negative .",
    "when allowance is made for the masking done on bright sources ( see sections  [ constructdatacubes ] and [ searchdatacubes ] ) , the area covered is 2286  arcmin@xmath20 , and the data cube emission - line search procedure covers a redshift range for ly@xmath0  detections of @xmath1 .",

    "2001 ; barger et al .  2002 ; szokoly et al .  2004 ; silverman et al .",
    "2005 ) , so the sources that are not detected have x - ray luminosities consistent with being star - forming galaxies .",
    "we hereafter refer to the sources that are x - ray detected ( and hence are clearly agns based on their x - ray luminosities ) as x - ray agns .",
    "nine of the laes have optical spectroscopic redshifts ( see column  12 ) .",
    "for all of these sources , the optical redshift confirms the uv redshift derived from the data cube search .",
    "four of these nine are x - ray agns , which is not too surprising , given that the spectroscopy in the ecdfs region was concentrated on x - ray selected objects .",
    "the mean offset and dispersion between the ground - based optical and the _ galex _ uv redshifts is @xmath50 .",
    "all three of the sources in the ecdfs region that were classified as agns based on the presence of high - excitation lines in their uv spectra are also x - ray agns . in the other direction , three of the 6 sources classified as x - ray agns were already classified as agns based on their uv spectra . of the remaining three sources ,",

    "are poorly positioned to detect either ovi@xmath53 or civ@xmath52 in their uv spectra , and only their ly@xmath0  lines are seen .    classifying sources as agns based on their uv spectra can be challenging , since quite often civ is not accessible , and , as can be seen from figure  [ spect ] , ovi is typically quite weak .",
    "the fraction of laes in the ecdfs region that were not classified as agns based on their uv spectra ( 10 sources ) but are classified as agns based on their optical spectra ( 2 sources ) is 20% .",

    "we can see that the pipeline extraction begins to miss sources below a ly@xmath0  flux of about @xmath56  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath6 and becomes progressively more incomplete at fainter fluxes , until below @xmath57  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath6 , very few sources are detected in the pipeline extraction .    in figure  [ z_mag]a , we use larger red symbols to denote sources with high - excitation uv lines ( in addition to ly@xmath0 ) in their _ galex _ spectra .",

    "we can see that at nuv@xmath58 , most of the sources are agns .",
    "thus , the only way to probe the bulk of the lae galaxy population at these redshifts is to do a data cube search of the present type .",
    "the sources found in the data cube search and missed in the pipeline are those with high ews .",

    "it appears that the morphologies of the objects follow their classifications : the agns are dominated by compact nuclei , while the star - forming galaxies are primarily resolved small blue galaxies , often with multiple components .",
    "in addition to not being detected in the cfht @xmath61-band , galex033246 - 274154 ( last thumbnail of the bottom row in figure  [ gems_thumbs ] ) is not clearly detected in the _ hst _ images .",

    "we used a flux limit of @xmath72  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath6 and only included sources that were not classified as agns in any way and that have rest - frame ew(ly@xmath0)@xmath73   .",

    "2008 and cowie et al .",

    "since many of the laes with ly@xmath0  luminosities @xmath77  erg  s@xmath6 have nuv@xmath2 , this correction is substantial .",

    "however , even allowing for this , we can see that there is a dramatic evolution in the luminosity function between @xmath78 and @xmath79 and that high - luminosity ly@xmath0  sources seen at still higher redshifts are already present at @xmath10 .",
    "in this paper , we described a new method for obtaining a flux - limited sample of laes from _ galex _ grism data .",
    "we showed how for intensively observed fields with large numbers of independent grism images we could construct three - dimensional ( two spatial axes and one wavelength axis ) data cubes from the grism images .",
    "we then constructed the data cube for the central region of the cdfs-00 , the field with the deepest _ galex _ grism observations , and used it to carry out a search for emission - line objects .",
    "we detected 28 new @xmath41 laes in our data cube search of the cdfs-00 . by comparing with the ecdfs x - ray data ,",
    "existing optical spectroscopy , and deep @xmath61-band imaging , we determined that the bulk of our new laes are real and that the uv spectroscopic redshifts based on the ly@xmath0  identifications are reliable . in looking at the high - resolution _ hst _ images that are available for some of the laes in our new sample , as well as for some of the laes from the _ galex _ pipeline sample , we found that the sources classified as agns are dominated by compact nuclei , while the sources that appear to be star - forming galaxies are primarily resolved small blue galaxies , often with multiple components .",
    "one of our new laes is spatially resolved with a linear major - axis diameter of 120  kpc .",
    "this places it in the category of the giant ly@xmath0  blobs , though at the low end in terms of its ly@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "the laes that had previously been found by the _ galex _",
    "pipeline were limited by the pipeline magnitude limit of nuv=22 , but the new laes extend to much fainter magnitudes .",
    "moreover , they also have higher ews , since for a given ly@xmath0  flux and redshift , the nuv=22 continuum cut corresponds to an ew , which becomes progressively lower as one moves to lower ly@xmath0  fluxes .",
    "the consequences of this are severe : the pipeline progressively misses more sources from a ly@xmath0  flux of @xmath80  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath6 down to a ly@xmath0  flux of @xmath81  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath6 , at which point it misses nearly all of them .    finally , we computed the cdfs-00 lae galaxy luminosity function for the redshift interval @xmath1 using both the very small sample of lae galaxies from the pipeline sample of cowie et al .",
