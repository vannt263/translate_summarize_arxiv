    "massive black holes ( bhs ) are likely in the majority of galactic nuclei over the whole hubble sequence and are recognized as fundamental building blocks in models of galaxy formation and evolution @xcite . according to the present cosmological model @xmath2cdm , structures formation involves hierarchical mergers of galaxies , which follow the hierarchical growth of their parent dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "galaxies may experience multiple mergers during their lifetime and , if more than one of these interacting galaxies host a massive bh , the formation of a black hole binary ( bhb ) is a natural consequence of the hierarchical paradigm @xcite .",
    "how long bhbs survive and whether they merge are key points for several questions in high - energy and extragalactic astronomy , as the detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "bhbs lifetime is governed by the loss of energy and angular momentum , by means of which two massive bhs become gravitationally bound and finally merge .",
    "bhbs are thought to undergo four dynamical stages before their coalescence @xcite .",
    "the first one is the dynamical friction stage , during which each bh inspirals independently toward the centre of the common gravitational potential on the chandrasekhar time - scale @xcite    @xmath3    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the number of stars , the one - dimensional velocity dispersion and the radius of the core , respectively , while @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the bh mass . during the second stage , usually referred to as non - hard binary stage , bhs velocities increase , while their orbital period shortens , because more and more stars in the galactic nuclear core are scattered off through gravitational slingshots , while the dynamical friction becomes less efficient .",
    "the third stage , labelled hard binary stage , begins when the orbital separation @xmath9 of bhs is about their influence radius @xcite    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the mass of the lighter bh .",
    "hard bhbs lose energy mainly by the three - body slingshot effect with stars passing in their vicinity , which are expelled after one or more encounters .",
    "the span of this phase depends on the loss - cone refilling .",
    "if it is dominated by two - body relaxation in a spherical and symmetric system , energy will not be lost efficiently and the binary may stall at parsec scale ( the so - called `` final parsec problem '' ) .",
    "however , more realistic calculations show that this stall does not sussist when , for example , asymmetric potentials or gas dynamics are taken into account @xcite .",
    "finally , the last stage is characterised by the energy loss due to gravitational radiation .",
    "a bhb will coalesce within the time @xcite",
    "@xmath12    where @xmath13 is the mass of the heavier bh and @xmath14 is the total mass .    on the point of view of observations , super massive bhbs ( smbhbs )",
    "are quite hard to detect , in particular in dry environments .",
    "however , the presence of surrounding gas enhances the possibilities of finding and resolving bhbs in galactic centres thanks to their energetic interactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , in these gas - rich systems , the bhb evolution is likely to be driven primarily by gas @xcite . on the other hand , in gas - poor environments ,",
    "when tidal disruption events enlighten the cores of galaxies hosting quiescent bhbs , observers are able to detect and study them @xcite .",
    "many galaxies show nucleated central regions , the so - called nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) , which are among the densest stellar populations observed in the universe @xcite .",
    "two different processes are thought to give birth to nscs .",
    "the first mechanism involves radial gas inflow into the galactic centre and predicts that nscs consist mostly of stars formed locally @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism suggests that massive stellar clusters , such as globular clusters ( gcs ) , spiral into the galactic centre and merge to form a dense nucleus @xcite .",
    "observations show that both processes occur in nature and contribute to the formation of nscs . in the latter scenario ,",
    "gcs are expected to be totally disrupted by bh tidal forces , but some stars may be accelerated to high velocities and ejected in jets from the inner galactic regions @xcite .",
    "high velocity stars have been observed in the galactic halo .",
    "such high velocities may be gained thanks to several physical mechanisms , as three - body interactions among binary systems or with the massive black hole in the galactic centre , or kicks due to supernovae explosions .",
    "high velocity stars can be divided in two different categories , i.e. runaway stars ( rs ) and hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) .",
    "rss , historically defined in the context of o and b stars @xcite , are galactic halo stars with peculiar motions higher than @xmath15 km s@xmath16 .",
    "such young massive stars are not expected to be present far from star - forming regions and are thought to have travelled far from their birthplace .",
    "two mechanisms are expected to produce rss : supernova ejections and dynamical ejections @xcite . in the first scenario @xcite",
    ", a rs has origin in a binary system , where it receives a velocity kick when its companion explodes as a supernova . in the dynamical ejection scenario @xcite",
    ", stars are accelerated thanks to a three- or four - body interaction @xcite .",
    "observations show that both the ejection mechanisms operate in nature @xcite , but , in any case , rss velocities are under the galaxy escape velocity .",
    "hvss are stars escaping the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite was the first to predict theoretically their existence , while @xcite serendipitously discovered the first hvs in the outer halo .",
    "hills mechanism involves the tidal breakup of a binary passing close to a massive bh and has been investigated in literature by several authors @xcite .",
    "moreover , hills scenario predicts the existence of a population of stars orbiting in the inner galactic regions around the central bh @xcite . also other mechanisms have been proposed to explain the production of hvss @xcite , as the interaction of a smbhb with a single star @xcite , the arrival from another nearby galaxy @xcite and supernova explosion in a close binary @xcite .    since high velocity stars production mechanisms involve different astrophysical phenomena , it would be possible to infer information about different branches of physics , as the physics of regions near massive bhs @xcite and of supernovae @xcite .",
    "moreover , the study of the proper motions of such fast moving stars can improve the knowledge of the galaxy gravitational potential shape and of its dark matter component @xcite .",
    "observations of high velocity and hypervelocity objects have usually been limited to high - mass , early - type stars due to obvious observational bias @xcite .",
    "nowadays , observers have started investigating low - mass high velocity stars @xcite , some of which are low - mass hvss candidates .",
    "moreover , the european esa satellite _ gaia _ ( http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia ) , along with _ gaia - eso _ ( http://www.gaia-eso.eu/ ) , is expected to measure proper motions with an unprecedented precision , providing for a larger and less biased sample , and to find @xmath17 hvss in a sample of @xmath18 stars .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the production mechanism of high velocity stars , which involves a gc and a smbhb .",
    "actually , when the orbit of a gc delivers it close to a bhb in the centre of its host galaxy due to dynamical friction , some stars are stripped from the cluster and may be ejected with high velocities . for these test cases",
    ", we assumed a total mass @xmath19 m@xmath1 with the scope of better underlying the physical mechanism and of making comparison with our previous results in the case of a single bh @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : meth ] we outline and describe our approach to the study of the consequences of the gc - bhb interaction . in section [ sec : res ] the results of our scattering experiments are presented and discussed .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : con ] we draw the conclusions .",
    "our scattering experiments refer to the interaction of three different components : a smbhb , a gc and a star . in our simulations the smbhb centre of mass sits initially in the origin of the reference frame , while the gc follows an elliptical orbit at a relatively close distance around it .",
    "the assumption of close distance to the bh is motivated by the fact that the globular cluster is supposedly orbitally decayed by dynamical friction braking suffered in the inner dense galactic regions .",
    "the smbhb initial circular orbit has radius @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , for the heavier black hole the initial conditions are given by    @xmath21    while for the lighter black hole by    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the radii of the circular orbits of @xmath13 and @xmath11 , respectively , around their centre of mass .",
    "the mechanical energy ( per unit mass ) of the gc on a circular orbit of radius @xmath6 , around the bhb center of mass ( neglecting the stellar background ) , is    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the circular velocity . thereafter , taking into account that the angular momentum ( per unit mass ) of the gc for the circular orbit is @xmath27 , the pericenter ( @xmath28 ) and apocenter ( @xmath29 ) distances of the gc on orbits of same energy ( @xmath30 ) , but different angular momentum @xmath31 , are given by    @xmath32    where the @xmath33 sign gives the pericenter and the @xmath34 sign gives the apocenter",
    "therefore , by varying the ratio @xmath35 , we can compare the circular orbit with a set of orbits at same energy , but different eccentricity    @xmath36    furthermore , in our simulations , the gc is assumed to have a @xcite mass profile    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the total mass of the gc and @xmath39 its core radius .",
    "the test star is on circular orbit inside the gc sphere of influence .",
    "the cartesian reference frame has been chosen as that with the @xmath40-axis along the line connecting the gc with the smbhb center of mass and @xmath41-axis orthogonal , so that the @xmath42 frame is equiverse to the gc orbital revolution .    to summarize ,",
    "the values of the relevant initial parameters have been set as follows ( see also table 1 ) :    * the total mass of the smbhb is @xmath19 m@xmath43 ; * the binary ratio @xmath44 assumes the values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ; * the radius @xmath51 of the smbhb initial circular orbit is set equal to @xmath20 ; * the initial phase @xmath52 of the bhb is randomly generated ; * the gc mass , @xmath38 , is fixed to @xmath53 m@xmath43 ; * the gc core radius @xmath39 is set to @xmath54 pc ; * the radius of the gc reference circular orbit is @xmath55 pc ; * the gc orbital eccentricity ranges from @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) to @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and is parametrized varying @xmath60 at steps of @xmath61 ; * the gc orbits are coplanar with the smbhb one ; * the test star mass , @xmath62 , is set equal to @xmath63 m@xmath43 ; * the test star circular orbit radii are equal to @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the radius of the hill s sphere ; * the star initial position on the circular orbits is randomly generated ; * the angles @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , which determine the orientation of the star circular orbit in the gc reference frame , are randomly generated .",
    ".the values of the binary mass ratio @xmath72 and of the binary circular orbit @xmath51 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]",
    "the existence of high velocity stars @xcite has been explained thanks to a dynamical ejection mechanism @xcite or a supernova ejection mechanism @xcite , which are able to accelerated stars up to several hundreds km s@xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "hvss @xcite require the presence of a massive bh , or massive bhb , due to their extreme velocities up to thousands km s@xmath16 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extended the recently study @xcite , referred to the case of a single bh .",
    "here we generalised the study to the ejection of high velocity stars due to the close passage of a massive gc near a massive bhb . in the frame of the @xmath2cdm cosmological model ,",
    "smbhbs are a natural consequence of the hierarchical paradigm @xcite .",
    "actually , galaxies may experience multiple mergers during their lifetime and , if more than one of them host a massive bh , the formation of a black hole binary is a natural result .    in our study , we assumed a total mass @xmath19 m@xmath43 of the smbhb to have a direct comparison with previous scattering experiments with a single bh @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism is a four - body interaction , where the bodies are the smbhb , the gc ( of mass @xmath53 m@xmath43 in our study ) and a generic test star ( @xmath63 m@xmath43 ) belonging to the cluster .",
    "we performed a series of high precision scattering experiments in order to investigate the ejection probability , after a close interaction with a smbhb , and the distribution velocity of the ejected stars .",
    "in @xcite results , the velocity distribution was nearly gaussian , narrow and peaked at low values in dependence on the gc core radius .",
    "the ejection velocity is roughly determined by the initial amount of star gravitational energy @xmath73 and by the pericentre @xmath74 of the gc orbit , while the dispersion of the velocity distribution by the different initial conditions and by the relative inclination angle between the angular momentum of the cluster and that of the test star . moreover ,",
    "when the interaction occurs with a smbhb , gc stars are able to exchange energy through gravitational slingshots , which enhances its ejection velocity and produces a tail in the distribution , which depends on the mass ratio @xmath72 of the bhb .",
    "actually , the higher is the mass ratio , the more extended the distribution toward high velocities will be . at the same time ,",
    "also the branching ratio for ejected stars depends on the mass ratio @xmath72 .",
    "while for low values of @xmath72 , the branching ratio remains nearly at the value of the single bh case ( @xmath75 ) , for @xmath76 , it is an increasing function of the mass ratio .",
    "finally , we performed the same set of simulations in the case of mass ratio @xmath77 , but assuming different eccentricities @xmath78 .",
    "the shape of the velocity distribution and the values of the branching ratios show that eccentricity has not a substantial effect on the results .",
    "therefore , our simulations suggest that the features of the ejected stars depend only on the binary mass ratio .    in conclusion , the effect of the binariety ( if @xmath76 ) is dual , since it enhances the probability of stars ejections and produces an extended tail in the velocity distribution , corresponding to the production of hvss .",
    "finally , we suggest that the infall of a gc on a smbhb could enhance the energy loss by the bhb and conduce them to the final stage , where gravitational waves emission is the main mechanism to cause the energy loss of the binary .",
    "we thank s. mikkola for making available to us his arw code and for useful discussions about his use .",

    "<S> after the interaction , few stars reach a velocity sufficient to overcome the galactic gravitational well , while some of them are just stripped from the globular cluster and start orbiting around the galactic centre .    </S>",
