    "evolution from the collapse of dense molecular cores to the formation of protostars has been discussed theoretically for several decades ( e.g. , hayashi 1966 ; shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) .",
    "advances in radio and infrared observations have confirmed many aspects of the evolution . the earliest phase of protostellar evolution , i.e. , the first core , however , still eludes observational confirmation though a theoretical prediction was made almost forty years ago ( larson 1969 ) .",
    "a first core is a hydrostatic object that forms after a star - forming core becomes optically thick to the dust continuum and the temperature evolution becomes adiabatic owing to inefficient radiative cooling .",
    "their roles in protostellar evolution include enabling binary formation and/or driving protostellar outflow ( e.g. , inutsuka 2004 ) .",
    "the difficulty in finding first - core objects is due to the following reasons .",
    "first , first - core objects are short - lived . after formation , they grow in mass by accretion of the envelope matter and the temperature inside increases .",
    "when the mass of the first core reaches about @xmath5 and simultaneously the temperature reaches 2000k , molecular hydrogen begins to dissociate .",
    "owing to effective cooling by dissociation , the first core begins collapse dynamically .",
    "using a typical accretion rate of @xmath6 , the timescale in the first - core phase is only @xmath7 yr , which is one or two orders of magnitude shorter than the class 0 phase .",
    "this means that the expected number of the first - core objects is only a few hundredth of class 0 objects .",
    "besides , the fact that first - core objects are deeply embedded in their parental molecular cores prevents detection .",
    "such difficulties are being overcome with a rapidly increasing number of observed young stellar objects , as well as with dramatical improvement of the sensitivity in the infrared / submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "encouraged by these facts , the search for protostars in their earliest phase is being undertaken vigorously . among them , onishi , mizuno , & fukui ( 1999 ) found l1527f ( also known as mc27 ) in taurus by the @xmath8 emission , which is a candidate for an object in the earliest stage of a protostar owing to its very high density ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "recently , a central submillimeter source ( l1521f - irs ) and near - mid infrared bipolar reflection nebulae with a luminosity 0.05@xmath10 was detected in this object by _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "( bourke et al . 2006 ) .",
    "another more promissing object is cha - mms1 , whose evolutionary stage appears to lie between l1527f and a starless core l1544 from the degree of @xmath11 fractionation and from the detection of a mid - infrared source that is several times less luminous than l1521f - irs ( belloch et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "knowledge of expected observational appearence of first - core objects is crucial in finding such objects and confirming their identity .",
    "some efforts have already been made along this line .",
    "boss & yorke ( 1995 ) presented the expected spectral energy distribution of an object in the first - core phase , using the result of a three dimensional simulation of star formation . by performing a one - dimensional radiative hydrodynamical calculation , masunaga ,",
    "miyama & inutsuka ( 1998 ) followed the formation and evolution of the first cores , and presented the evolution of their emission spectrum . the above mentioned hydrodynamical studies , however , failed to follow the structure of the postshock flow of the accretion shock due to its extreme thinness , although the majority of emission is created there ( stahler , shu , & taam 1980 ) .",
    "in addition to this , those authors included only the dust thermal emission in their calculation . in this paper , we take another approach . with a simpler assumption concerning the dynamics of the accreting envelope",
    ", we correctly solve the structure and emission process in the postshock flow .",
    "using the injection radiation from the shock , we solve radiative transfer in the protostellar envelope . in this way",
    ", we obtain the observable radiation spectrum from the first - core object .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model for calculating the emission from the first - core objects . in section 3 , we present the results . in section 4 , we summarize this paper , and present a discussion and the conclusion .",
    "in figure [ fig : schematic ] , we present a schematic view of our model of a first core and its envelope . for the structure and evolution of the envelope",
    ", we adopt a self - similar solution .",
    "given the radius of the first core , which is the location of the accretion shock , the shock velocity and preshock density are obtained from a self - similar solution .",
    "chemical and radiative processes in the postshock relaxation layer are analyzed by assuming a steady state shock . finally , using the radiative energy injection obtained as mentioned above , we solve the radiative transfer in the envelope .",
    "we describe specific procedures in the following .",
    "we adopt a similarity solution as an envelope density structure .",
    "two types of similarity solutions , ( i ) the larson - penston ( lp ; larson 1969 ; penston 1969 ) and ( ii ) shu ( shu 1977 ) solutions , are studied . in translating the similarity solutions to physical quantities ,",
    "we assume isothermal evolution at 10k . in figure 2",
    ", we show the density distributions in the envelope both for lp and shu similarity solutions . the structure at three epochs , where the mass of the first core @xmath12 and @xmath5 , is illustrated for each model . as the maximum mass of the first core , we take @xmath13 following masunaga & inutsuka ( 2000 ) . as the total mass of the core , i.e. the sum of the first - core mass and the envelope mass , we take @xmath14 . in both solutions ,",
    "the density low follows @xmath15 for inner radius and becomes steeper , @xmath16 , outside . the rarefaction wave , which separates the inner and outer parts , propagates outward at the sound speed . in the outer region ,",
    "the shu solution coincides with the singular isothermal sphere , while the density of the lp solution is 4.4 times higher .",
    "note that even with the same @xmath17 , the time which elapsed since the formation of the first core is different for the two solutions .",
    "since the mass - accretion rate is @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) for the lp ( shu , respectively ) solution , which is constant for isothermal similarity solutions , the age of the first core is @xmath20 , and its entire lifetime is @xmath21yr for the lp solution , and @xmath22yr for the shu solution . for the same first - core mass , the rarefaction wave propagates to about a 50-times larger radius in the shu solution than in the lp one .",
    "thus , the lp solution is hardly modified , except at the innermost region , while the shu solution evolves remarkably during the first - core stage ( see figure [ fig : r_rho ] ) .",
    "we take the radius of the first core , @xmath23 , as a free parameter . for the fiducial case , we take @xmath24au from the spherical symmetric model ( masunaga , miyama , & inutsuka 1998 ) .",
    "we fix the radius in time because it is found to be almost constant from hydrodynamical simulations ( masunaga et al .",
    "taking account of the possibility that rotating first cores can be more flattened and extended ( saigo & tomisaka 2006 ) , we also study the case of @xmath25au in order to mimic this effect .",
    "we then consider four models that are combinations of either lp or shu solutions , and either @xmath265 , or 10 au .",
    "these four models are called as lp05 , lp10 , s05 , and s10 , hereafter . at a given time",
    ", the mass inside @xmath23 is used as the first core mass , @xmath17 .",
    "the postshock flow is treated as a steady - state shock problem .",
    "the preshock density is given by a self - similar solution once the shock radius is fixed .",
    "the preshock temperature is given by solving radiative transfer in the envelope ( sec .",
    "2.3 ) .    using the shock velocity @xmath27 , mach number @xmath28 , preshock pressure @xmath29 and number density @xmath30 ,",
    "the postshock initial values can be obtained by the following rankin - hugoniot relations : @xmath31 where we use subscript 1 ( 2 ) for the preshock ( postshock , respectively ) variables , and @xmath32 is the ratio of specific heat .    in the postshock relaxation layer ,",
    "since the gas kinetic temperature @xmath33 is higher than the radiation temperature @xmath34 , the thermal energy is converted to the radiation energy .",
    "we follow the evolution of a postshock gas parcel until @xmath33 reaches @xmath35 in the following way .",
    "the equations of conservation of mass and momentum fluxes , @xmath36 can be incorporated in a single equation , @xmath37 coupling the above relation with the equation of state for an ideal gas @xmath38 we solve the energy equation @xmath39 where the energy density per unit mass is @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the radiative cooling rate .",
    "this determines the structure of the postshock flow .",
    "the radiative cooling is by line emission and dust thermal emission , @xmath42 in the first term @xmath43 , we include the fine - structure and metastable transitions of c , c@xmath44 and o , and molecular rotational transitions of h@xmath3 , co , oh and h@xmath3o . those are treated as in omukai et al .",

    "the dust temperature is calculated by the energy balance between radiative loss from the dust and collisional heating by gas ( see omukai et al .",
    "2005 for details ) .",
    "the postshock flow is optically thin to the dust continuum . among radiative cooling processes mentioned above",
    ", the h@xmath3o emission and dust thermal emission are dominant .",
    "chemical processes among compounds of h , c and o are included , as in omukai ( 2000 ) , where the reaction rate coefficients for the c and o chemistry are based on millar et al .",
    "hydrogen is assumed to initially be fully molecular .",
    "the initial abundances of other species in the gas phase are set to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 following pollack et al .",

    "if the postshock temperature is higher than the evaporation temperature of ice , which is about 150k , molecules locked in the ice are released into the gas phase . in this case , the amounts of h@xmath3o , co and co@xmath3 in the ice mantle @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are added to the gas - phase chemistry .      to solve the temperature structure in the envelope and the final processed radiation , we need to specify the injection radiation from the accretion shock , which is the sum of the emission from the postshock relaxation layer and radiation from interior of the first core . in the previous section , we described the method to calculate the emission from the relaxation layer . at the bottom of this layer ,",
    "the radiation and matter are thermally well - coupled .",
    "thus the radiation intensity is given by the blackbody radiation at temperature @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the temperature there .",

    "using the postshock relaxation temperature @xmath67 obtained above , the injection radiation to the envelope from the accretion shock is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the energy emission rate in the postshock layer per unit area , and can be obtained by integrating the radiative cooling rate along the postshock flow , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the radiative cooling rate per unit frequency .",
    "the factor 1/2 in the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : i_in ] ) comes from the fact that the other half of the radiation goes into the first core .",
    "the radiation field in the envelope is determined by solving the radiative tranfer under the input radiation from the inner boundary .",
    "we used the variable eddington factor method ( mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) .",
    "the temperature @xmath33 is determined by the radiative equilibrium @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the monochromatic mean intensity in the continuum , and @xmath79 is the mean intensity integrated over frequency in a line @xmath80 .",
    "since the gas and dust are thermally coupled in the envelope , we do not distinguish their temperatures . in solving radiative transfer ,",
    "we only consider the dust continuum as a source of opacity in the envelope . in",
    "all calculated mass ranges in the lp05 model and some in the lp10 model , the dust ice mantle sublimates and h@xmath3o vapor exists in the innermost portion of the core .",
    "however , this part is also optically very thick to dust continuum , and the h@xmath3o - line luminosity is significantly attenuated by the dust absorption in the surrounding region . since we are not interested in such weak line emission , we do not include the h@xmath3o - line opacity in our model .",
    "the model is constructed as follows :    \\(i ) given the model parameters , namely , the shock radius @xmath23 and the type of similarity solution ( lp or shu ) .",
    "\\(ii ) calculate the shock velocity @xmath27 and the preshock density @xmath81 for a given @xmath23 (  2.1 ) .",
    "then , assume the preshock temperature @xmath68 and the radiation temperature in the postshock layer @xmath34 .",
    "\\(iii ) solve the postshock flow (  2.2 ) and obtain the injection radiation field @xmath82 from the shock .",

    "\\(v ) if the assumed and calculated @xmath68 coincide and the shock boundary condition ( eq .",

    "if not , go back to ( ii ) with modified @xmath68 and @xmath34 , and repeat this procedure until convergence .",
    "in figure [ fig : shock ] , we present the temperature distribution in the postshock relaxation layer for three epochs with the first core mass being 0.0125 , 0.025 , and 0.05 @xmath83 ( i.e. , 0.25 , 0.5 , and 1.0 @xmath84 , respectively ) . the distribution is shown as a function of the column density from the accretion shock : a higher column density corresponds to more downstream .",
    "the cooling rate by each cooling agent , namely , the dust thermal emission and the h@xmath3o and @xmath85 line emission , is shown individually in figure [ fig : shock2 ] for the same flows .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : shock ] , the postshock temperature @xmath86 is more dependent on the assumed first - core radius @xmath23 , rather than the type of similarity solution .",
    "it is @xmath87k for the cases of @xmath24 au , while @xmath88k for those of @xmath25 au .",
    "this can be understood as follows . by assuming @xmath89 in the preshock and @xmath90 in the postshock , @xmath91 since the flow velocity is approximately given by free - fall @xmath92 the postshock temperature can be written as @xmath93 since the equation above does not contain the type of similarity solution , the values of postshock temperature are similar for the two solutions with the same @xmath94 and @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dust temperature , which is close to the radiation temperature , is higher for the lp solutions , because of higher luminosity and higher optical depth in the envelope . assuming the radiative diffusion equation @xmath95 in the envelope and approximating the left hand side by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the outer radius of the envelope",
    ", we obtain @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the envelope optical depth .",
    "this shows that the higher luminosity and higher envelope optical depth result in a higher radiation temperature ( @xmath100 ) at the first - core surface .    despite the smaller cooling rates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shock2 ] ) , the shocked gas cools at a lower column density in the shu models ( @xmath101 ) than in the lp ones ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this is because of the longer timescale in the shu cases : since the accretion rates of the lp and shu solutions are different by a factor of about fifty , for the same column density the time which elapsed after the shock is also different by the same factor .    in all models , for low column densities , thermal energy in the postshock flow",
    "is dissipated mostly in dust continuum emission ( see fig.[fig : shock2 ] ) .",
    "the postshock temperature is several hundred degree k ( fig.[fig : shock ] ) , and increases with the first - core mass , reaching 900k ( lp05 ) for @xmath13 . in this temperature range ,",
    "the most efficient molecular coolant is h@xmath3o , and its cooling rate is as large as that by dust continuum for small column densities ( see fig.[fig : shock2 ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath103 , the h@xmath3o lines become optically thick and the cooling rate decreases .",
    "the optical depth effect is apparent when we compare the h@xmath3o cooling rate with that by its isotope h@xmath104o , which remains optically thin .    in figure",
    "[ fig : l_sh ] , we show the contribution to the luminosity emitted in the postshock layer by the individual components ; dust continuum , h@xmath3o lines , h@xmath105o lines , and oh lines .",
    "although the contribution of the h@xmath3o - line cooling to the shock dissipation increases with the first - core mass , the maximum fraction of radiated energy in the h@xmath3o lines is at most about 10% , except for the s05 model . in s05 model ,",
    "the h@xmath3o - line cooling is as important as the dust continuum at the end of the first - core phase @xmath106 . in this model , since the postshock gas temperature is high ( 700k ) and it takes a long time for the layer to become optically thick , the h@xmath3o lines contribute to cooling as much as the dust emission .",
    "the contribution of the water isotope @xmath85 is very small owing to its small abundance .",
    "the second important species as a coolant is oh . however , its role is only temporary : since oh is intermediate species in chemical reactions leading to h@xmath3o formation , its cooling rate decreases as oh is being converted to h@xmath3o .",
    "the value of the h@xmath3o luminosity is dependent on the h@xmath3o fraction as well as the gas temperature . in figure",
    "[ fig : chem ] , we show the h@xmath3o and o concentrations at the bottom of the postshock relaxation layer . in lp05 model , the postshock dust temperature is higher than the evaporation temperature of the ice , even in our minimum mass case of 0.0125@xmath83 .",
    "thus a large amount of water vapor [ @xmath107 ] is already present just below the shock . for the lowest mass case @xmath108 , the final h@xmath3o concentration remains almost the same as the initial value ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chem ] a ) . in the cases with higher mass ,",
    "the final h@xmath3o concentration increases with @xmath17 by a chemical process in the postshock flow owing to higher temperature and thus higher h@xmath3o production rate ( wagner & graff 1987 ; kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) . for @xmath109 ,",
    "most of the remaining oxygen , which is not locked to co , is converted to h@xmath3o via oh .",
    "this can be observed as a decrease in the oh luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l_sh ] a ) . in the lp10 model , the ice mantle evaprates for @xmath110 .",
    "this can be seen as the discontinuous rise in the h@xmath3o concentration , as well as the h@xmath3o luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l_sh ] b ) .",
    "additional h@xmath3o production by chemical reactions slightly increases the h@xmath3o concentration in the high-@xmath17 cases .",
    "the ice mantles do not evaporate in either the s05 or s10 model . in the s05 model , additional h@xmath3o",
    "is produced by high - temperature gas - phase chemistry for @xmath111 , while in the s10 model h@xmath3o hardly increases from the initial value of @xmath62 .    in table 1 , we list the important transitions , their energy fluxes @xmath112 and the luminosities @xmath113 generated in the postshock relaxation layer .",
    "the emitted luminosities are higher and the wavelengths of the strongest emission lines are shorter for lp / small @xmath23 cases than for the shu / large @xmath23 cases . in general , the emitted radiation from the shock is subject to absorption and re - emission in the envelope ( sec .",
    "3.2 ) , and thus these values does not correspond to the observable line luminosities . however , if cavities are present in the envelope due to outflow , rotation , etc .",
    ", the shock emission can come out unattenuated . in this case , the emission lines listed in table 1 are observable probably as mid - infrared nebulosity",
    ".      a first - core object is enshrouded with an optically thick envelope , where radiation emitted from the accretion shock is absorbed and reemitted as dust thermal radiation .",
    "the total optical depths of the envelopes for each frequency are shown for the lp05 and s05 models in figure [ fig : tau ] .",
    "the envelope is optically thick at wavelengths shorter than 1 mm in the lp05 model ( lp10 : 600@xmath114 m , s05 : 100@xmath114 m , s10 : 75@xmath114 m , respectively ) . with increasing mass of the first core ,",
    "the inner portion of the envelope is accreted and the optical depth decreases .",
    "this is not a large effect compared with the differences between the lp and shu models .",
    "figure [ fig : r_t ] shows the temperature distribution in the envelope . for the lp models ,",
    "the dust photosphere locates at @xmath115 au , outside of which the envelope is optically thin and reemitted photons escape freely .",
    "the temperature falls approximately as @xmath116 and @xmath117 in optically thick and thin regimes , respectively ( e.g. , sec . 4.2 of hartmann 1998 ) . below its vaporization temperature ( @xmath118 150 k ) , h@xmath3o ice is an important contributor to the opacity .",
    "therefore , for @xmath119k , due to evaporation of ice mantle of dust , the dust opacity is reduced .",
    "this causes the flattening of temperature profile in the innermost region observed in the lp models . for the shu models , where the envelope is optically thin",
    ", the temperature obeys @xmath117 in the entire envelope .",
    "figure [ fig : dustsed ] shows the spectrum of processed dust radiation , i.e. the radiation escaping from the envelope .",
    "the emitted dust radiation @xmath120 in the shock is also shown for comparison .",
    "however , the peak of the shock emission locates at rather short wavelength , around 10 - 100@xmath114 m , due to high temperature in the postshock flow , while that of processed radiation appears at longer wavelength , 100@xmath114m-1 mm , which reflects the lower envelope temperature .",
    "the envelopes of the lp models are optically thick both to the shock and the processed radiation , while those of the shu models are optically thick to the emitted radiation , but optically thin to the re - emission . owing to this difference , the processed spectra of the lp models resemble the blackbody radiation @xmath121 on the rayleigh - jeans side , while those of the shu model have flatter spectra in low frequencies @xmath122 approximately ( fig . [ fig : dustsed ] ) .",
    "this flat spectrum is explained by the following consideration .",

    "the monochromatic luminosities of these lines are higher than that of the dust continuum .",

    "the h@xmath3o luminosities are only @xmath140 of the dust luminosities , while in the shu models , about 1% of the radiation is still in h@xmath3o lines after reprocessing in the envelope .",
    "profiles of brightness temperature are shown for different wavelength bands in figures ( [ fig : tb.100g])-([fig : tb.100micron ] ) .",
    "these figures show that in low frequencies where the envelopes are optically thin , the emission from the first cores is directly visible",
    ". then , a discontinuity appears in the brightness temperature distribution at the radius of the first core . on the other hand , at the shorter wavelengths , where the envelope is optically thick , only the emission from the dust photosphere in the envelope is visible . with increasing observing frequency",
    ", the brightness temperature at the center decreases and the discontinuity at the first - core surface disappears .",
    "we calculated the radiation spectrum of young stellar objects in their first - core phase .",
    "as envelope models , we studied cases of the larson - penston ( lp ) and the shu self - similar solutions . in the lp model , the emitted spectrum has a peak at @xmath141 m both for the dust continuum and h@xmath3o lines .",
    "the optical depth of the envelope at this frequency is @xmath142 , such that virtually all of the shock emission is absorbed in the envelope and reemitted as the dust thermal emission at lower frequencies .",
    "the amount of total luminosity remains unchanged , which is @xmath143 , but the emission peak is shifted to lower frequency owing to the lower temperature in the envelope .",
    "the processed spectrum can be approximated by the blackbody radiation with temperature 30k , which peaks at 200@xmath114 m .",
    "our result for the continuum spectrum is consistent with a previous study by masunaga & inutsuka ( 2000 ) . in the shu models ,",
    "the amount of total luminosity is @xmath144 , which is smaller by almost two orders of magnitude than in the lp model owing to the smaller accretion rate by a similar factor .",
    "the dust temperature in the postshock layer is lower ( @xmath145k ) , and thus the wavelength of the emission peak is longer ( @xmath146 m ) than that in the lp case ( @xmath141 m ) .",
    "however , owing to the lower optical depth in the envelope , the peak of the processed spectrum is at a shorter wavelength ( @xmath147 m ) than that in the lp case .",
    "strong h@xmath3o emission from accreting protostars has already been pointed out by neufeld & hollenbach ( 1994 ) , who considered the shock on the surface of circumstellar disks of more evolved objects .",
    "they carried out a parameter study for shocks with a preshock density of @xmath148 and a velocity @xmath149 , and calculated the emission from them .",
    "although , in their calculations , protostars tend to be more massive , and shocks are thus stronger than ours ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 in our models ) , our shock calculations and results are very similar to their weakest shock cases . provided that shock conditions are similar , it is a difficult task to distinguish observationally whether the shock is on the disk surface or on the stellar surface without spatially resolving the emission region . in the case of accretion onto the disk ,",
    "the amont of dust extinction can be smaller than that in our case .",
    "using this fact , we might be able to tell the geometry of the shock .",
    "we need more studies in the future to confirm this possibility .",
    "so far , we have discussed the case of spherical symmetry , where the envelope absorbs the shock emission and reemits it at the longer wavelengths . in practice , however , outflows are observed almost ubiquitously in very young stellar objects , such as class 0 objects .",
    "theoretically , it is known that outflows can be launched as early as the first - core phase ( machida et al .",
    "2006 ) . even without outflow ,",
    "a flattened disk - like density distribution is realized by the presence of angular momentum ( terebey , shu , & cassen 1984 ) .",
    "thus , it is highly plausible that the envelope is optically thin in the polar direction while it is optically thick in the equatorial ( disk ) one .",
    "if so , the shock emission escapes unattenuated and can be observed directly in the polar direction , or as a reflection nebula in other directions . in these cases ,",
    "the radiation is mostly emitted in the mid - infrared range , and about 10% of the emission is in h@xmath3o lines at similar wavelengths ( see table 1 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrated that observations in mid- to far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths are important for finding the first - core objects . among observational facilities at these wavelengths , we examine observational feasibilities by currently operating _ spitzer space telescope ( spitzer ) _ and _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia )",
    "_ , as well as forthcoming _ herschel space observatory _ , _ atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) _ and _ space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics ( spica)_. _ spitzer _ has a spectroscopic line sensitivity of @xmath152 in mid - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath153 m ) and a photometric sensitivity of @xmath2mjy at @xmath154 m and @xmath155mjy at @xmath156 m .",
    "here we suppose the observation time to be one hour . the airborne telescope _",
    "sofia _ has a spectroscopic line sensitivity of @xmath157 at mid to far - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath158 m ) and photometric sensitivity of @xmath159mjy at @xmath154 m and @xmath115mjy at @xmath156 m .",
    "_ herschel _ is a space telescope with its aperture 3.5 m and oberving wavelengths @xmath160 m .",
    "its spectroscopic line sensitivity is @xmath161 in short wavelengths ( @xmath162 m ) and @xmath163 in longer wavelengths , while its photometric sensitivity is @xmath164mjy .",
    "the millimeter and submillimeter telescope _",
    "alma _ observes at @xmath165 ( or @xmath166ghz ) , with its spectroscopic line sensitivity @xmath167 and photospheric sensitivity @xmath168 0.1mjy . finally , _",
    "spica _ is an infrared space telescope with a 3.5 m aperture , the same as _ herschel _ , but its mirror is cooled to 4.5k , far cooler than that of _ herschel _ ( 80k ) .",
    "the observing wavelengths are from 5@xmath114 m to 1 mm , with its spectroscopic line sensitivity being @xmath169 .",
    "its photospheric sensitivity depends strongly on the wavelength : it is @xmath170jy around 10@xmath114 m and @xmath1681mjy around 100@xmath114 m .    here ,",
    "we evaluate the h@xmath3o line flux from first - core objects .",
    "after attenuation in the envelope , the maximum value of the h@xmath3o - line luminosities is @xmath171 with its wavelength around 100@xmath114 m in the shu models , although it is significantly dimmer in the lp models . if there is a cavity in the envelope owing to outflow or rotation , and the shock radiation leaks through it without reprocessed in the envelope , the line luminosities take the maximum value at around @xmath172 m both for the lp and shu solutions , with its value being @xmath173 ( lp ) or @xmath174 ( shu ) , respectively ( see figures [ fig : water_lp05 ] - [ fig : water_s10 ] ) .",
    "below , as a typical distance to a first - core object , we use 1kpc , farther than neighboring star - forming regions , because , for detection of such rare objects , the observation of a large number of young stellar objects is needed .",
    "the line flux can be given by @xmath175 where we use typical values of the luminosities for unattenuated ( @xmath176 ) and attenuated radiation ( @xmath177 ) in the first and second expressions , respectively .",
    "if the shock emission from a first core is visible without attenuation in the envelope , _ spitzer _ is able to detect it in sources as far as 1kpc .",
    "if sources are closer , _ sofia _ also has chance to observe them .",
    "however , their sensitivities at far - infrared wavelengths are not enough for observing the attenuated emission . on the other hand , _ spica",
    "_ can detect both processed line radiation through the envelope and direct radiation from the accretion shock as far as 1kpc .",
    "owing to lack of the sensitivity at the mid - infrared wavelengths , the other future telescopes can not observe shock radiation .",
    "as for the attenuated line radiation , which appears in the submillimeter range , the sensitivity of _ herschel _ is not sufficient .",
    "although sensitivity of _ alma _ appears to be sufficient , absorption by telluric water vapor prohibits the observation of h@xmath3o lines in the submillimeter range .",
    "next we discuss the observability of the dust continuum . using a typical value @xmath178 at a typical wavelength of processed radiation @xmath179 ( see figure [ fig : dustsed ] ) , the flux of dust continuum is @xmath180 which falls below the sensitivities of currently operating _ sofia _ and _ spitzer _ , but is above those of all three future telescopes discussed here . in particular , having sensitivity both for direct and processed radiation , _ spica _ is most suitable for observing the first - core objects not only by the h@xmath3o emission , but also by the dust continuum .    in summary ,",
    "_ spica _ can observe first - core objects as far as 1kpc by far - infrared dust emission and ( if the collapse is shu - like ) by the h@xmath3o emission .",
    "in addition , if the hot dust emission and h@xmath3o high - excitation - line emission in the mid - infrared wavelengths originating from the accretion shock come out unattenuated through a possible cavity , _ spica _ can detect them as direct or reflection light , depending on the orientation between the cavity and the observer .",
