    "when managing a portfolio , a trader needs to raise cash in order to finance a number of operations .",
    "those include maintaining the hedge of the position , posting collateral resources , and paying interest on collateral received",
    ". moreover , the trader needs to account for the possibility that the position may be liquidated prematurely due to his own or his counterparty s default , hence entailing additional costs due to the closeout procedure .",
    "cash resources are provided to the trader by his treasury desk , and must be remunerated .",
    "if he is borrowing , he will be charged an interest rate depending on current market conditions as well as on his own credit quality .",
    "such a rate is usually higher than the rate at which the trader lends excess cash proceeds from his investment strategy to his treasury .",
    "the difference between borrowing and lending rate is also referred to as _",
    "funding spread_.    even though pricing by replication can still be put to work under this rate asymmetry , the classical black - scholes formula no longer yields the price of the claim . in the absence of default risk , few studies have been devoted to pricing and hedging claims in markets with differential rates .",
    "@xcite considers option pricing in a market with a higher borrowing than lending rate , and derives an interval of acceptable prices for both the buyer and the seller .",
    "@xcite consider the problem of hedging contingent claims under portfolio constraints allowing for a higher borrowing than lending rate .",
    "@xcite study the super - hedging price of a contingent claim under rate asymmetry via nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations ( bsdes ) .",
    "the above studies do not consider the impact of counterparty credit risk on valuation and hedging of the derivative security .",
    "the new set of rules mandated by the basel committee ( @xcite ) to govern bilateral trading in otc markets requires to take into account default and funding costs when marking to market derivatives positions .",
    "this has originated a growing stream of literature , some of which is surveyed next . @xcite and",
    "@xcite introduce a bsde approach for the valuation of counterparty credit risk taking funding constraints into account .",
    "he decomposes the value of the transaction into three separate components , the contract ( portfolio of over - the - counter derivatives ) , the hedging assets used to hedge market risk of the portfolio as well as counterparty credit risk , and the funding assets needed to finance the hedging strategy . @xcite and",
    "@xcite derive a risk - neutral pricing formula by taking into account counterparty credit risk , funding , and collateral servicing costs , and provide the corresponding bsde representation .",
    "@xcite derives a closed form solution for the price of a derivative contract , which distinguishes between funding , repo and collateral rates , but ignores the possibility of counterparty s default .",
    "moreover , he assumes that borrowing and lending rates are equal , an assumption which has been later relaxed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite generalize @xcite s model to include default risk of the trader and of his counterparty .",
    "they derive pde representations for the price of the derivative via a replication approach , assuming the absence of arbitrage and sufficient smoothness of the derivative price .",
    "@xcite develop a general semimartingale market framework and derive the bsde representation of the wealth process associated with a self - financing trading strategy that replicates a default - free claim .",
    "as in @xcite , they do not take counterparty credit risk into account .",
    "@xcite , study the existence of fair bilateral prices . a good overview of the current literature is given in @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we introduce a valuation framework which allows us to quantify the total valuation adjustment , abbreviated as xva , of a european type claim .",
    "we consider an underlying portfolio consisting of a default - free stock and two risky bonds underwritten by the trader s firm and his counterparty .",
    "stock purchases and sales are financed through the security lending market .",
    "we allow for asymmetry between treasury borrowing and lending rates , repo lending and borrowing rates , as well as between interest rates paid by the collateral taker and received by the collateral provider .",
    "we derive the nonlinear bsdes associated with the portfolios replicating long and short positions in the traded claim , taking into account counterparty credit risk and closeout payoffs exchanged at default . due to rate asymmetries , the bsde which represents the valuation process of the portfolio replicating a long position in the claim can not be directly obtained ( via a sign change ) from the one replicating a short position .",
    "more specifically , there is a no - arbitrage interval which can be defined in terms of the buyer s and the seller s xva .",
    "we show that our framework recovers the model proposed by @xcite , as well its extension to the case in which the hedger and his counterparty can default . in both cases , we can express the total valuation adjustment in closed form , as a percentage of the publicly available price of the claim .",
    "this gives an interpretation of the @xmath0 in terms of funding costs of a trade and counterparty risk , and has risk management implications because it pushes banks to compress trades so as to reduce their borrowing costs and counterparty credit exposures ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the crucial assumptions of the piterbarg s setup is that rates are symmetric . in the case of asymmetric rates ,",
    "closed form expressions are unavailable , but we can still exploit the connection between the bsdes and the corresponding nonlinear pdes to study numerically how funding spreads , collateral and counterparty risk affect the total valuation adjustment . in this regard , our study extends the previous literature in two directions .",
    "first , we develop a rigorous study of the semilinear pdes associated with the nonlinear bsdes yielding the xva .",
    "related studies of the pde representations of @xmath0 include @xcite and @xcite , who consider an extended black - scholes framework in which two corporate bonds are introduced in order to hedge the default risk of the trader and of his counterparty .",
    "they generalize their framework in @xcite to include collateral mitigation and evaluate the impact of different funding strategies .",
    "second , we provide a comprehensive numerical analysis which exploits the previously established existence and uniqueness result .",
    "we find strong sensitivity of @xmath0 to funding costs , repo rates , and counterparty risk .",
    "viewing both buyer s and seller s @xmath0 as functions of collateralization levels defines a no - arbitrage band whose width increases with the funding spread and the difference between borrowing and lending repo rates .",
    "as the position becomes more collateralized , the trader needs to finance a larger position and the xva increases . both buyer s and seller s xva may decrease if the rates of return of trader and counterparty bonds are higher than the funding costs incurred for replicating the closeout position .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we develop the model in section [ sec : model ] and introduce the replicated claim and collateral process in section [ sec : claim ] .",
