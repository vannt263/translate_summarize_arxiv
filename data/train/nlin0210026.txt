    "during the phanerozoic ( 540mya  present ) , the diversity of the biosphere ( total number of species , also known as biodiversity ) has increased dramatically .",
    "the trend is most clear for intermediate taxonomic levels ( families and orders ) , as fossil species data is too incomplete and higher taxonomic levels ( phylum and class diversity ) have been fairly constant since the paleozoic .",
    "a recent review is given by benton(2001)benton01 .",
    "the most completely documented diversity trend is amongst marine animals , which exhibits a plateau during the paleozoic ( 540 - 300mya ) , followed by an accelerating diversity curve since the end of the permian .",
    "the corresponding trend amongst continental , or land animals is characterised by a clear exponential growth since the first species colonised dry land during the ordovician .",
    "benton argues that the terrestrial trend is more characteristic than the marine trend , owing to the far greater diversity shown amongst land animals , even though the marine fossil record is more complete .",
    "similar trends have been reported for plants@xcite .",
    "bedau _ et al._(1998)bedau - etal98 introduced a couple of measures to capture the amount of adaptation happening in a general evolutionary system .",
    "the basic idea is to compare the dynamics of the system with a neutral shadow system in which adaptation is destroyed by randomly mixing adaptive benefits amongst the components of the system ( think of the effects ultra - marxism might have on an economy ! ) .",
    "the amount of adaptive activity ( numbers of each component in excess of the shadow model integrated over time ) and adaptive creativity ( numbers of speciations per unit time exceeding a threshold of activity ) is measured .",
    "bedau has also introduced a general neutral shadow model that obviates the need to generate one on a case by case basis@xcite .    using these measures , it is possible to distinguish 3 classes of activity :    1 .",
    "unadaptive evolution , when the mutation rate is so high that organisms have insufficient time to have their adaption tested before being killed off by another mutation 2 .   adapted but uncreative evolution , when species are highly adapted , but mutation is so low that ecosystems remain in perpetual equilibrium 3 .   creative , adaptive evolution ,",
    "when new species continuously enter the system , and undergo natural selection    the biosphere appears to be generating open ended novelty  not only is it creative , but it is _ unboundedly _ creative .",
    "evidence for this exists in the form of the intricate variety of mechanisms with which different organisms interact with each other and the environment , and also in the sheer diversity of species on the planet . whilst there is no clear trend to increasing organismal complexity@xcite",
    ", there is the clear trend to increasing diversity mentioned above , which is likely to be correlated with ecosystem complexity .",
    "bedau takes diversity as a third evolutionary measure , and distinguishes between _ bounded _ and _ unbounded creative _ evolution , according to whether diversity is bounded or not .",
    "all artificial evolutionary systems examined to date have , when creative , exhibited bounded behaviour .",
    "this was also the case of the _ _ model @xcite .",
    "bedau has laid down a challenge to the artificial life community to create an unbounded , creative evolutionary system .",
    "the heart of the idea of unbounded creative evolutionary activity is the creation and storage of information .",
    "the natural measure of this process is _ information based complexity _ , which is defined in the most general form in@xcite .",
    "the notion , drawing upon shannon entropy and kolmogorov complexity@xcite is as follows :    a language @xmath0 , is a countable set of possible descriptions @xmath1 , and a map @xmath2 .",
    "we say that @xmath3 have the same meaning iff @xmath4 .",
    "denote the length of @xmath5 as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the information content ( or _ complexity _ ) of a description @xmath5 is given by : @xmath8 in the usual case where the interpreter ( which defines @xmath9 ) only examines a finite number of symbols to determine a string s meaning , @xmath10 is bounded above by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the size of the alphabet .",
    "this is equivalent to the notion of _ prefix codes _ in algorithmic information theory .",
    "now consider how one might measure the complexity of an ecosystem .",
    "diversity is like a count of the number of parts of a system  it is similar to measuring the complexity of a motor car by counting the number of parts that make it up .",
    "but then a junkyard of car parts has the same complexity as the car that might be built from the parts . in the case of ecosystems ,",
    "we expect the interactions between species to be essential information that should be recorded in the complexity measure .",
    "but a simple naive counting of food web connections is also problematic , since how do we know which connections are significant to a functioning ecology ?    to put the matter on a more systematic footing , consider a tolerance @xmath13 such that @xmath14 are considered identical if @xmath15 .",
    "now two different population dynamics @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 can be considered identical ( i.e. @xmath19 iff and @xmath20 may diverge exponentially in time , and that a better definition of equivalence would also require similarity of the attractor sets as well . the results derived here would only be a lower bound of the ecosystem complexity under this more refined definition of equivalence . ]",
    "@xmath21    at this point for the sake of concreteness , let us consider lotka - volterra dynamics : @xmath22 where @xmath23 refers to elementwise multiplication , @xmath24 is the net population growth rate and @xmath25 is the matrix of interspecific interaction terms .    over evolutionary time , the growth coefficients @xmath26 , the self - interaction coefficients @xmath27 and the interspecific interaction coefficients @xmath28 form particular statistical distributions @xmath29 and @xmath30 repectively .    since inequality ( [ defeq ] )",
    "must hold over all of the positive cone @xmath31 , it must hold for population density vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in which case eq .",
    "( [ defeq ] ) can be broken into independent component conditions on @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be written : @xmath34 ) .",
    "the term for the growth coefficients is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the ecosystem diversity .    the complexity term for the interaction terms is given by @xmath38    if @xmath13 is chosen very small , the total ecosystem complexity is proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "this is because the zeros of the interaction matrix are encoding information .",
    "however , if @xmath40 , then ( [ c_beta ] ) becomes : @xmath41 this gives flesh to our intuitive notion that complexity should somehow be proportional to the number of connections making up the food web .",
    "empirically , lotka - volterra dynamics has been shown to exhibit an inverse relationship between connectivity and diversity @xmath42@xcite .",
    "may(1972)may72 demonstrated this relationship in connection with dynamical stability .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that an ecology undergoing evolution is often stable .",
    "if this result holds more generally , it implies that complexity is directly proportional to diversity , so that diversity indeed is a good proxy for ecosystem complexity .",
    "although earlier foodweb studies demonstrated this hyperbolic diversity - connectivity relationship , more recently collected data suggests a relationship of the form @xmath43 , with @xmath440.30.4 @xcite .",
    "if complexity indeeds scales superlinearly with diversity as suggested by latter data , then a system displaying open - ended diversity growth is indeed growing in complexity , however a system displaying bounded diversity growth may still be growing in complexity .",
    "_ _ is an evolutionary ecology , and is to my knowledge the first published account of population dynamics being linked to an evolutionary algorithm@xcite .",
    "the next model to be developed in this genre is webworld@xcite , which features a more realistic ecological dynamics , and handles resource flow issues better .",
    "other models in this genre have appeared recently @xcite .",
    "_ _ is also the name of a software package used for implementing this model , as well as other models .",
    "the software is available from .",
    "the model consists of lotka - volterra ecology : @xmath45  is the population density vector ,  the growth rates ( net births - deaths in absence of competition ) ,  the interaction matrix ,  the ( species specific ) mutation rates and  the migration rate . in the panmictic case ,",
    "the  term is left out , and  refers to total populations , rather than population densities .",
    "the mutation operator randomly adds new species @xmath46 into the system with phenotypic parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) varied randomly from their parent species .",
    "a precise documentation of the mutation operator can be found in the _ _ technical report@xcite .",
    "the vector has integral valued components  in assigning a real valued vector to it , the values are rounded up _",
    "randomly _ with probability equal to the fractional part .",
    "for instance , the value 2.3 has a 30% probability of being rounded up to 3 , and a 70% probability of being rounded down .",
    "negative values are converted to zero .",
    "if a species population falls to zero , it is considered extinct , and is removed from the system .",
    "it should be pointed out that this is a distinctly different mechanism than the threshold method usually employed to determine extinction , but is believed to be largely equivalent .",
    "diversity @xmath37 is then simply the number of species with @xmath50 , and connectivity is the proportion of interspecific connections out of all possible connections : @xmath51    spatial _ _",
    "is implemented as a spatial grid , with the @xmath52 term being replaced by the usual 5-point stencil .",
    "a _ specialist _ is a species that only depends on a restricted range of food sources , as opposed to a _ generalist _ which might depend on many food sources .",
    "a specialist has fewer incoming predator - prey links in the food web than does a generalist .",
    "much evolutionary variety is expressed in sophisticated defence mechanisms that serve to suppress outgoing predator - prey links . in this context",
    ", i will use the term _ specialist _ in a more general sense to refer to species with a small number of food web links . in order for the panmictic ecolab model to generate an increasing diversity trend",
    ", a corresponding specialisation trend must also be present ( which it is nt in the case of the usual mutation operator ) .",
    "interestingly , specialisation is usually considered to be the default mode of evolution@xcite .",
    "generalists only exist because they happen to be more robust against environmental perturbation .",
    "this experiment involves modifying the mutation operator to bias it towards removing interaction terms .",
    "the usual _ _ mutation operator operator adds or removes connections according to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a uniform random variate ( _ _ technical report)ecolab - tech - report . in this experiment , a new experimental parameter @xmath55 ( ` gen_bias ` )",
    "is introduced such that @xmath56 and the number of connections added or deleted is given by @xmath57 . by specifying a very negative value of @xmath58 , the mutation operator will tend to produce specialists more often than generalists .",

    "as described in @xcite , activity is weighted by the population density , not just presence of a particular species .",
    "the results show unbounded creative evolutionary activity ( class 4 behaviour ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ connectivity ] , the system remains close to the hyperbolic critical surface , yet the dynamic balance has been removed by the specialisation trend . if we assume that @xmath61 , then unbounded diversity growth can only happen if @xmath62 vanishes at least as fast as @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "[ div - conn ] ) .",
    "an ecosystem consisting entirely of specialists has a constant number of foodweb links per species , or @xmath64 .",
    "the presence of generalists in the ecosystem damps the growth in diversity , and unbounded growth is only possible if the proportion of generalists continually diminishes over time .",
    "in @xcite , i suggested that one possible explanation for the diversity growth since the end of the permian was the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea . a simple estimate given in that paper indicated that the effect might account for a diversity growth of about 3.5 times that existing during the permian .",
    "this was remarkably similar to the growth reported by@xcite , however it is worth noting that benton s data referred to families , not species .",
    "it is expected that the numbers of species _ per family _ also increased during that time@xcite . furthermore ,",
    "when continental organism are included , familial diversity today is more like 5 times the diversity during the permian .",
    "unbeknownst to me at the time , vallentine(1973)vallentine73 had proposed essentially the same theory , called _ biogeographic provincialism _ ( the notion that the number of biological provinces is increased through rearrangement of the continents ) .",
    "the idea received some serious support by signor(1990)signor90 , although in a later review he was less enthusiastic@xcite .",
    "tiffney and niklas(1990)tiffney - niklas90 examined plant diversity in the northern hemisphere and concluded that plant diversity correlated more with the land area of lowlands and uplands , rather than continental breakup .",
    "benton(1990)benton90 is characteristically sceptical of biogeographic provicialism as an explanation of the diversity trend through the phanerozoic .",
    "biogeography theory depends on an assumed dynamic balance between speciation and extinction , which appears to be contradicted by the fossil data for continental animals@xcite , which shows a strong exponential increase in diversity through the phanerozoic .    since the _",
    "_ model has this dynamic balance between speciation and extinction when the dynamics self - organise to the critical surface @xmath65 , i experimented with the spatial version of _ _ reported in @xcite .",
    "the maximum migration rate @xmath66 was swept up and down exponentially in time according to @xmath67 , _",
    "i.e. _ with a time constant of about 9500 timesteps , by scaling by 0.9 every 1000 timesteps ( and then inverting the scaling factor every 174,000 timesteps ) .",
    "it is a little hard to relate",
    "_ _ figures to biological evolution .",
    "the maximum growth rate in _ _ is @xmath68 , so the doubling time for the fastest organism in the ecosystem is around 100 timesteps .",
    "this might correspond to a year or so of real time .",
    "so migration rates are being forced much faster than is typical in the real world . however , in ecolab we also tend run the mutation rate quite high , with adaptive speciations happening every 1000 timesteps or so .",
    "if the mutation rate is too high , natural selection has no chance to weed out non - adaptive species , if too low , too much computing resource is need to obtain interesting dynamics . in practice ,",
    "the mutation rate is set about 2 orders of magnitude less than the critical amount needed for adaptation . in terms of speciation rates",
    ", the migration rate time constant might correspond to something of the order of @xmath69 years , instead of the 10 years or so one gets from considerations of doubling times .",
    "this code is released as ecolab 3.5 . due to a design flaw , performance of this code scales poorly with diversity , unless the code is run in parallel with one cell per execution thread . for this experiment ,",
    "the runs took place on a @xmath70 spatial grid , on a four processor parallel computer supplied by the australian centre for advanced computing and communications , apart from one run of a @xmath71 grid on a 9 processor system .",
    "work is currently underway to implement a spatial version of the _ _ 4.x code , which does not suffer from this performance problem .",
    "the results of a typical run is shown in figure [ mig - sweep ] .",
    "the run started with a maximum migration rate of 0.01 at the bottom right hand corner of the figure and swept down to @xmath72 before increasing .",
    "the migration rate was swept back and forwards 5 times over the 18 million time steps in the run .",
    "=    the first thing to note was that the expected response of diversity to migration rate was not there .",
    "we would expect a response of the form @xmath73 , with @xmath74 in the @xmath70 case , and @xmath75 varying smoothly between 1 for the infinite migration ( panmictic ) case and 2 for zero migration .",
    "these results tentatively indicate that possibly @xmath75 does not vary smoothly at all , but is nearly constant for most values of @xmath66 .",
    "this needs to be resolved with further study .",
    "the second thing to note is the completely unexpected `` resonance '' at about @xmath76 .",
    "it is not peculiar statistical aberration , since the same result was obtained with completely different random number seeds , and fixing the migration rate at the resonance value produces an exponential growth in diversity ( figure [ resonance ] ) .",
    "=    3 more tests were performed to determine if this result is an artifact of discretisation , or a feature of the dynamics .",
    "the first involved changing the grid to a @xmath71 grid , which did not affect the location of the resonance .",
    "the second involved scaling all parameters in the model ( , , ) by 0.1 , which is equivalent to changing the timescale .",
    "if the effect was purely due to dynamics , one would expect the resonance to shift one order of magnitude higher on the scale , however little qualitative different was observed .",
    "the third test involved performing the migration operator every 1000 timesteps , instead of 100 .",
    "this did change the resonance value by 1 order of magnitude , ruling out certain classes of software faults .",
    "the choice of diversity as a proxy measure for ecosystem complexity is a good choice .",
    "complexity is obviously constrained by diversity , so that bounded diversity dynamics also implies bounded complexity dynamics .",
    "however , in the case of evolutionary lotka - volterra dynamics , the system will tend to self - organise to a critical surface where speciation is balanced by extinction .",
    "this surface defines the maximum allowed complexity for a given diversity value , which turns out to be proportional to the diversity .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper could be extended to other evolutionary ecologies as well .    whilst there is still debate about whether the biosphere is exhibiting unbounded complexity growth ,",
    "i am persuaded by bentons(2001)benton01 argument that the growth is nothing short of spectacular . in this paper",
    "i examined two possible mechanisms for diversity growth  _ specialisation _ which proves capable of delivering unbounded creative evolution in _ _ , and _",
    "biogeographic provincialism_. whilst i was only expecting biogeographic changes to deliver a modest impact on diversity , _ _ delivered a unexpected result of a `` resonance '' , where if the migration rate was tuned to this value , diversity grew exponentially .",
