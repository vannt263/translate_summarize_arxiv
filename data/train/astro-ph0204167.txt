    "the detection of very high energy cosmic neutrinos is important from at least three points of view .",
    "first , they can carry astrophysical information about point sources which are optically thick at almost all wavelengths and relics of an early inflationary phase in the history of the universe .",
    "second , the connection between the emission of cosmic nuclei , gamma rays , and neutrinos from astrophysical accelerators is of considerable interest with regards the problem of the origin of extragalactic extremely high energy cosmic rays .",
    "third , due to vacuum oscillations , a flux of high energy cosmic neutrinos is expected to be almost equally distributed among the three flavors due to vacuum oscillations , provided that the neutrinos are produced by distant objects such as gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and hence the study of oscillation effects on high energy neutrino fluxes can be used to study neutrino mixing and distinguish between different mass schemes  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the potential of the telescope array ( ta ) , which will be able to detect cosmic neutrinos with energies above 10@xmath0  ev , so far unobserved .",
    "they have great potential as probes of astrophysics and particle physics phenomena .",
    "they have escaped from regions of dense matter and point back to their sources and they provide a unique window into the most violent events in the universe .",
    "hadrons are accelerated to extremely high energies , regardless of their source , accelerating mechanism , and composition ( i.e. @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 ) , and a subsequent decay of accompanying pions is expected to result in neutrino fluxes through the decay process @xmath3 , with a resultant ratio @xmath4=2 .",
    "observations  @xcite of cosmic rays with energies beyond the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite raise interest in extremely high energy neutrinos .",
    "the gzk mechanism can lead to neutrino fluxes well above those from proposed exotic sources for the super - gzk events around the energy of 10@xmath5  ev .",
    "a curious coincidence between the energy flow of the highest energy cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) suggests a possible common source  @xcite .",
    "another speculation is that very high energy cosmic rays may be the result of the annihilation of topological defects left over from the early universe  @xcite .",
    "the energy scales of such events are of the order of 10@xmath6  ev ( gut scale ) .",
    "in addition to these ideas is the proposal that the highest energy cosmic rays are evidence for novel particle physics or astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "these super - gzk events provide motivation for examining and confirming predictions of modes of photo production mechanisms .",
    "the neutrino fluxes of some representative sources and the range of atmospheric neutrino background as the zenith angle changes from @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given in fig.[fig : neutrino - flux ] .",
    "note the atmospheric neutrino background  @xcite appears to have so large spectral index that it can not largely contribute to the neutrino detection in the higher energy region above 10@xmath0  ev in any source models .    ) from greisen photo production  @xcite , active galactic nuclei  @xcite , gamma ray bursts  @xcite , topological defects  @xcite , and z - bursts  @xcite .",
    "an agn - core flux model  @xcite has been rejected by amanda - b10  @xcite .",
    "the band with vertical hatching shows the range of atmospheric neutrino background  @xcite as the zenith angle changes from 90@xmath9 ( highest ) to 0@xmath9 ( lowest ) .",
    "[ fig : neutrino - flux ] ]    in each of these source cases , neutrino induced air - showers penetrate the atmosphere to a great depth .",
    "the imaging technique used in the ta detector has an advantage in this respect as it can observe the slant depth of a deeply penetrating air - shower",
    ". the recent discovery of near - maximal @xmath10-@xmath11 and @xmath11-@xmath12 mixing  @xcite has a significant impact on the detection strategy .",
    "the proposed astrophysical sources produce predominantly @xmath11 and @xmath10 with very small admixtures of @xmath12 .",
    "however , these sources are so far away that , even at the high energies of interest here , cosmic neutrino fluxes with a @xmath13 ratio at the source of @xmath14 , inevitably oscillate in the three neutrino framework to a ratio of @xmath15 , irrespective of the mixing angle . by looking for upward moving showers from earth - skimming tau neutrinos",
    ", one can test for the existence of neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "once created in the earth , a charged lepton loses energy through bremsstrahlung , pair production , and photonuclear interactions . at the earth s surface , with a density of about 2.7  g/@xmath16 ,",
    "tau leptons and muons are expected to travel 11  km and 1.5  km , respectively , before losing a decade in energy ; electrons however do not travel any significant distance .",
    "detectable neutrinos therefore skim the earth at angles approximately 1@xmath17 above the horizontal and these events are expected to be predominantly showers induced by tau neutrinos .    another important signature of very high energy tau neutrinos is the `` double bang '' which they produce in the atmosphere .",
    "the initial shower is produced by the original interaction which creates a tau lepton and a hadronic shower .",
    "this is followed by the decay of the tau lepton , producing the second shower bang .",
    "the two bangs are separated by a distance of @xmath184.9  km  ( e@xmath19/10@xmath20  ev ) where e@xmath19 is the energy of the tau lepton converted from the tau neutrino .",
    "this decay length is measurable with the imaging telescopes in the ta detector .",
    "the ta detector ( figs.[fig - sites ] and [ fig - stat_t01 ] ) has been designed in order to investigate the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays  @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", the detector is required to obtain statistics of a much greater number of events than the rate of one super - gzk event per year that the agasa is able to detect .",
    "it should also provide particle identification as well as accurate determination of the direction of the primary cosmic ray to test the source models at a high confidence level .",
    "the basic measurement principle use a huge effective aperture to detect the image of fluorescence light produced by air showers and from this the longitudinal shower development can be reconstructed .",
    "the ta detector consists of 10 observational stations installed over an area at about 30 - 40  km intervals as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sites ] .",
    "each station consists of 40 telescopes with a 3  m - diameter f/1 mirror system on 2 layers of supports .",
    "256 2-inch photo multiplier tubes ( pmts ) mounted on the focal plane serve as pixels of the fluorescence sensor of each telescope .",
    "each pmt covers a visual field of angular aperture 1.1@xmath211.0@xmath17 .",
    "we expect the detection rate by the ta detector for events with energies beyond the gzk - cutoff to exceed that of agasa by about 30 times .",
    "we note that this is similar to that expected for another proposed detector , the pierre auger observatory ( auger )  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of determining the energy and arrival direction for the highest energy events are roughly 25% and 0.6@xmath17 respectively .    in order for the detector stations to have good visibility , atmospheric transparency , no significant nearby sources of light pollution , and be away from significant traffic ,",
    "it is preferable to install them on top of small mountains or hills , while still maintaining the arrangement in 30 - 40  km intervals .",
    "we have identified sites in the south - west area of delta in southern utah .",
    "the planned detector station array covers an area of 200  km@xmath22 .",
    "neutrinos can produce air showers through interactions with the atmosphere .",
    "the number of the shower depends on the particular interaction .",
    "we consider here both inelastic charged and neutral current interactions , which always produce hadronic showers .",
    "note however that the case of charged current electron neutrino interactions , in addition to the emerging electron , a pure electromagnetic shower carrying a large fraction of the incoming particle energy is produced .    in our discussions of neutrino induced showers we make use of new calculations of the cross sections of charged - current and neutral current interactions of neutrinos with nuclei  @xcite , according to the cteq4-dis ( deep inelastic scattering ) parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "the cteq4-dis parton distributions take account of new information about parton distributions within the nucleon  @xcite using accurate and extensive dis data from the new muon collaboration ( nmc )  @xcite and desy ep collider hera  @xcite , as well as new data from e665  @xcite .    for a neutrino flux",
    "@xmath23 interacting through a particular process with differential cross section @xmath24 , where _ y _ is the fraction of the incident particle energy transferred to the target , the event rate for deeply penetrating showers can be obtained by a simple convolution : @xmath25 & = & \\nonumber \\\\ n_{a}\\rho _ { air}\\int _ { e_{th}}^{\\infty } & de_{\\nu } & \\int _ { 0}^{1 } dy   \\frac{di_{\\nu } } { de_{\\nu } } ( e_{\\nu } ) \\frac{d\\sigma } { dy}(e_{\\nu } , y ) \\epsilon ( e_{sh } ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is avogadro s number and @xmath27 is the air density .",
    "the energy integral corresponds to the primary neutrino energy @xmath28 which is related to the shower energy @xmath29 , the relationship being different for each interaction .",
    "@xmath30 is the detector acceptance , a function of shower energy , which corresponds to the volume and solid angle integrals for different shower positions and orientations with respect to the detector .",
    "the function is different for both showers induced by charged current electron neutrino interactions and those arising in neutral current or muon neutrino interactions .",
    "this is because hadronic and electromagnetic showers have different particle distribution functions . for @xmath31",
    "charged current interactions , we take the shower energy to be the sum of hadronic and electromagnetic energies , @xmath32 . for @xmath33 charged current interactions and for neutral current interactions , we take the shower energy to be the hadronic energy , @xmath34 . we take the inelasity @xmath35 to be a function of @xmath36 as in reference  @xcite , while @xmath370.25 does not depend strongly on the primary energy beyond @xmath38  ev in both charged and neutral current interactions .    in the case of @xmath12",
    ", we must also take into account the decay length of secondary tau leptons , subsequent tau lepton decay , and a further energy input into the air shower from decaying electrons , photons , and hadrons .",
    "the tau decay branching fractions and tau polarization effect are reasonably well accounted for simply by assuming that the energies of neutral mesons fully contribute to the electromagnetic showers .",
    "the adopted decay branching fractions and the momentum spectra of the decay with a polarization of @xmath391 in the colinear approximation in the laboratory frame are shown in table  [ tab : taudecay ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : taudecay - x ] respectively .",
    "the @xmath40 decay length is often long enough that two subsequent energy inputs into the air showers can be seen in the field of view .    .",
    "tau decay branching fractions from particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite and used in the simulation for events in ta .",
    "the branching fractions in the simulation should include @xmath41 contributions .",
    "[ tab : taudecay ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the next generation of cosmic ray detectors such as auger and the ta have target volumes of atmosphere competitive with or better than that of icecube and their annual detection rates assuming agn - jet proton acceleration models are statistically sizable  @xcite .",
    "the ta using an air fluorescence technique is advanced as a method for discriminating primary neutrinos proton induced air showers . recently a novel strategy for detecting earth - skimming extremely high energy neutrinos has been quantitatively proposed for which significant improvements in detection can be made using the ta detector compared to down - going neutrino detection  @xcite . encouragingly , extremely high energy cosmic neutrino sources , to say nothing of agn proton acceleration models , such as greisen photo production  @xcite , topological defects  @xcite , long - lived super heavy particles , and z - bursts  @xcite , may be experimentally tested with the ta .",
