    "the virgo cluster is the second brightest , extragalactic , extended x - ray source in the @xmath11 kev rosat band , and the closest galaxy cluster ( 16.1 mpc ; tonry 2001 ) .",
    "the central galaxy of the virgo cluster , m87 , hosts an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) that exhibits compelling evidence for complex interactions with the surrounding cluster gas ( bhringer 1995 ; young 2002 ; forman 2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "m87 is , therefore , an _",
    "excellent _ object with which to study agn driven processes ( agn feedback ) that affect the centers of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "the relatively cool , dense gas at the centers of many galaxy clusters emits copiously at x - ray wavelengths . in the absence of a significant heat source",
    ", this gas would be expected to cool quickly and promote significant star formation , at rates an order of magnitude larger than observed ( see peterson & fabian 2006 for a review ) .",
    "the energy required to offset this cooling is widely believed to come predominantly from the central agn , though the exact process or processes by which this occurs remains unclear ( see mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) .",
    "agn inflate bubbles of relativistic radio plasma , which displace the x - ray emitting gas , forming clear cavities .",
    "this process is expected to provide a significant source of heating and turbulence ( churazov 2001 ; see also brggen & kaiser 2002 ; kaiser 2003 ; brggen 2003 ; de young 2003 ; ruszkowski 2004a , b ; heinz & churazov 2005 ) .",
    "sound waves and internal waves generated by cavity inflation also provide a mechanism to heat the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "these waves have been observed in both the perseus and centaurus clusters ( fabian 2003 ; fabian 2006 ; sanders & fabian 2007 ; sanders & fabian 2008 ) .",
    "agn induced shock activity is a further promising avenue to heat the icm .",
    "clear indications of agn - induced shocks are seen in several nearby galaxies and clusters , the best examples being hydra a , virgo , and perseus clusters ( nulsen 2005a ; simionescu 2009 ; forman 2005 , 2007 ; fabian 2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "agn induced shocks in clusters are typically weak ; hercules a hosts the strongest observed agn driven shock in a cluster with a mach number @xmath12 ( nulsen 2005b ) .",
    "these outbursts can also be very energetic ; ms0735 + 7421 boasts the highest observed energy with @xmath13 ergs associated with its shock ( gitti 2007 ) . in galaxies and galaxy groups , these shocks can be much stronger with mach numbers as high as @xmath14 as observed in centaurus a ( croston 2009 ; kraft 2003 ) . in m87 ,",
    "forman ( 2005 ) identified shock fronts associated with an agn outburst @xmath15 years ago . they argued that shocks may be the most significant mechanism of heating the cool icm near the core by the agn .",
    "forman ( 2007 ) also measure temperature and density jumps that are consistent with a weak shock with mach number @xmath16 .",
    "however , important uncertainties remain .",
    "for example , significant temperature jumps are not seen across all putative shock fronts ( graham 2008 ) .",
    "additionally , the observed pressure features are sometimes several kpc thick ( fabian 2006 ) , complicating our understanding of how these processes work .    in m87 , two x - ray bright ` arms ' , discovered by feigelson ( 1987 ) using the _ einstein observatory _",
    ", are the most striking features driven by agn activity .",
    "these arms extend to the southwest and east of the galactic center , are composed of cool gas , and are spatially coincident with extended radio emission ( bhringer 1995 ; belsole 2001 ; molendi 2002 ) .",
    "bhringer ( 1995 ; see also churazov 2001 ) propose that these structures are the result of gas uplift in the wakes of bubbles of radio plasma buoyantly rising in the hot icm .",
    "however , the details of this process and the role of magnetic fields are largely not understood .",
    "subsequent _ chandra _ and observations of m87 have revealed many additional complexities in the system ( belsole 2001 ; matsushita 2002 ; molendi 2002 ; bhringer 2002 ; sakelliou 2002 ; young 2002 ; forman 2005 , 2007 ; simionescu 2007 , 2008 ; werner 2006 ) .    here , we present the second in a series of papers studying in unprecedented detail the thermodynamic properties of m87 . using an ultra - deep ( 574 ks ) observation , we utilize fully the excellent spatial resolution of the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. this paper focuses on the overall thermodynamic structure and fe distribution of the galaxy and surrounding cluster , and on the properties of the strongest shock features .",
    "other papers will study the detailed physics of the x - ray bright arms and inner post - shock regions ( werner 2010 ; hereafter paper i ) and the history of chemical enrichment ( million 2010 , in prep ; paper iii ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the data reduction , basic imaging analysis , and spatially resolved spectroscopy .",
    "section 3 presents detailed thermodynamic maps for the cluster .",
    "section 4 presents results on the radial properties of the ambient icm to the north and south of the agn ; this excludes the x - ray bright arms , which introduce strong multi - temperature structure into the profiles .",
    "we place important new constraints on the isothermality of the ambient cluster gas .",
    "section 5 discusses the results , focusing on the shock features at radius @xmath17 arcsec , the isothermality of the ambient cluster gas , and a high significance metallicity bump at @xmath18 arcmin .",

    "the individual regions for spectral fitting were determined using the contour binning method of sanders ( 2006 ) , which groups neighboring pixels of similar surface brightness until a desired signal - to - noise threshold is met . for data of the quality discussed here , regions outside the x - ray bright arms are small enough that the x - ray emission from each can be approximated usefully by a single temperature plasma model .",
    "regions inside the x - ray bright arms show strong evidence for multi - phase gas ( see paper i ) . in this paper , however , as a first approximation , we model all regions as a single temperature plasma , recognizing that this will bias the results for the x - ray bright arms .",
    "we constrain each region to have @xmath31 net counts , giving @xmath016,000 total regions for a total of @xmath016,000,000 net counts .",

    "errors in each bin were determined from an mcmc analysis having chain lengths of at least 10@xmath81 samples , after correcting for burn - in . a good match between the temperature measurements and the gaussian model",

    "[ fig : errorratios ] shows the ratio of the observed width of the emission measure distribution ( labelled @xmath82 ) divided by the expectation , given the observed mean statistical error ( labelled @xmath83 ) .",
    "only one out of 8 regions show evidence for a deviation from isothermality .",
    "this region is located at the temperature discontinuity behind the shock front .",
    "the temperature distribution in the other seven regions is consistent with being isothermal .",
    "projection effects are not expected to have a significant influence on the analysis .",
    "the observed isothermality at a given radius implies either that the ambient cluster gas beyond the arms is relatively undisturbed by agn uplift , or that there is efficient conduction within a spherical shell .",
    "if conduction is responsible for the observed isothermality at a given radius , then the likely orientation of the magnetic fields is perpendicular to the radial direction , as expected under action of the heat - flux buoyancy instability ( quataert 2008 ; see also bogdanovi 2009 ; parrish 2009 ) .",
    "visual inspection of fig .",
    "5 also suggests that the metals in the ambient icm are significantly clumped .",
    "a detailed analysis of the metal distribution and a discussion of the implications for turbulence and conduction in the icm will be presented in future work .",
    "[ fig : bias ] shows the temperature ( left ) and metallicity ( right ) profiles measured from both the peaks of the emission measure distributions for the individual regions ( open squares ) and from the integrated annular spectra presented in section [ section : ambient ] ( filled circles ) .",
    "the temperature and metallicity results from the two techniques are systematically different by 10 and 30 per cent respectively .",
    "the magnitude of this offset decreases as a function of radius .    from spectral simulations ,",
    "we have determined that this bias is a combined modelling and signal - to - noise issue .",
    "low temperature spectra ( below @xmath2  kev ) contain a strong line contribution at energies where _",
    "chandra s _ effective area is the largest .",
    "however , in low signal - to - noise spectra , one can not determine the abundances of individual elements separately .",
    "these are instead implicitly tied to the fe abundance .",
    "the flux from line emission is , therefore , modelled improperly which biases the temperature and metallicity to low values . increasing the signal - to - noise of the spectra reduces these biases , while simultaneously causing the residuals around the fe l complex to significantly increase .",
    "the apparent position dependence is , therefore , explained by the temperature dependence of the intensity of these line components .",
    "the bias in low signal - to - noise spectra can be lessened by fitting a model with the abundance ratios of the individual elements adjusted to their best - fit values , as determined from a fit to the higher signal - to - noise spectra .",

    "the shock models assume a spherically symmetric , hydrodynamic model of a point explosion in an initially isothermal , hydrostatic atmosphere .",

    "this model provides no significant change to the calculated surface brightness profile , which is already fit well by the simple point explosion model .",

    "table 2 shows the mach number and shock radius from 4 different 30 degree wedges ( from -4050 degrees and also from 190220 degrees ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties dominate the modelling of the surface brightness in these wedges .",
    "these include any projected non - sphericity of the shock due to the likely jet axis alignment near our line of sight , and the incorrect assumption of an initially isothermal , hydrostatic atmosphere .",
    "we , therefore , do not include standard , statistical error bars from the models .",
    "instead , we estimate the uncertainty in the mach number by finding a mach number which brackets the observed scatter in the surface brightness profiles ( see fig . [",
    "fig : vert ] ) .",
    "this represents a conservative estimate of the uncertainty in the mach number of the shock .",
    "the overall shape of the surface brightness constrains the mach number of the shock to within @xmath93 per cent . the radius and mach number of the shock vary at the ten per cent level as a function of position angle .",
    "this is likely due to the detailed structure of the ambient gas and shock front in each sector .     +    the temperature profiles for the position angles of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : ktfens ] , are shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : vert ] we have approximated the ambient temperature profile as a linear fit to the plotted data range , excluding the bins within the @xmath1 arcsec thick shock . under this assumption ,",

    "[ fig : shock_kt ] shows the expected projected temperature profile divided by the pre - shock temperature profile as a function of radius .",
    "the @xmath05 per cent rise in the temperature and the @xmath040 arcsec thick shock in the observed , projected temperature profile are fully consistent with the shock model given an average mach number @xmath5 ( see fig . [ fig : shock_kt ] ) .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the high pressure ring is consistent with a shock with @xmath5 .",
    "thick shocks have also been observed in the perseus cluster ( see fabian 2006 ) , which does not show a clear temperature jump at the leading edge of the front .",
    "the small increase in temperature within the thick over - pressurized ring in m87 suggests that shock heating is present in these systems but that the thickness and the small amount of heating associated with these weak shocks makes temperature increases difficult to detect .",
    "a second shock is seen closer to the core ( @xmath1 arcsec ; section 3.2 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] ) the properties of this shock are difficult to constrain due to its proximity to the core . many other surface brightness features ( the cavities filled with radio plasma seen in fig . [ fig : zoom ] ) are observed at similar radii , preventing an accurate determination of the pre - shock gas properties and the mach number .",
    "however , the projected temperature jump seen to the south of the agn at @xmath54 arcsec ( 3 kpc ; fig . [",
    "fig : zoom ] ) , suggests a mach number of at least @xmath6 .",
    "the presence of the two shocks suggests that agn outbursts are fairly common .",
    "the estimated mach numbers from these shocks and their relative distances can be used to determine the frequency of these outbursts .",
    "these shocks suggest that agn outbursts occur approximately every @xmath7 myrs .",
    "shock heating is likely only relevant in the central regions of the cluster because shocks significantly weaken as they expand .",
    "if repeated shocks occur every @xmath7 myrs , as is suggested here , then agn driven , weak shocks could produce enough energy to offset the radiative cooling of the icm ( nulsen 2007 ) .",
    "bhringer ( 1995 ; see also churazov 2001 ) propose that rising bubbles filled with radio emitting plasma may be responsible for dragging cool , metal - rich gas up out of the central regions of clusters .",
    "buoyant bubbles will rise to a height that depends on their entropy , stopping when they reach their appropriate adiabat .",
    "this process may explain the observed radio edges at @xmath97 arcsec ( 2331 kpc ) and also at @xmath98 arcsec ( 3139 kpc ) .",
    "when the bubbles reach their maximum height , they flatten .",
    "a consequence of this interpretation is that metal - rich gas rising with the radio bubbles should be deposited at a radius similar to that at which the bubbles flatten .",
    "our abundance profiles show evidence for enhancements in fe abundance at @xmath99 arcsec ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : ktfe]b , [ fig : ktfens]b ) .",
    "this is a similar radius to the outer edges of the x - ray arms .",
    "indeed , bumps are observed in the abundance profiles of all elements except oxygen ( paper iii ) .",
    "the amount of fe that is uplifted can be determined from the excess metallicity measured at that radius and the gas mass . in detail ,    @xmath100    where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the mass and excess abundance of fe , @xmath103 is the gas mass , and @xmath104 is the mass fraction of fe ( lodders 2003 ) .",
    "we measure the gas mass and excess fe abundance in the northern sector from a deprojection analysis ( using data from position angles of -10855 degrees ) .",
    "this implies a total mass of uplifted fe of @xmath105 m@xmath106 .",
    "we compare this to the fe mass currently present in the arms ( simionescu 2008 ) . for a gas mass of @xmath107 m@xmath106 and an fe abundance of 2.2 ,",
    "those authors measure an fe mass of @xmath108 m@xmath106 in the x - ray bright , cool arms .",
    "thus , a single generation of uplifted metals from buoyant bubbles is , in principle , enough to explain the observed excess fe mass at large radius .",
    "it is unknown how much of the uplifted metals will remain at large radius after the bubbles flatten .",
    "lower significance bumps at higher radius that coincide with previous generations of radio bubbles may argue that this process occurs over multiple generations .",
    "it is likely that the magnetic field configuration and its evolution will also have an impact ( bogdanovi 2009 ) . in the perseus cluster",
    ", metallicity enhancements also correspond well to the edges of several radio lobes , which suggests a similar origin to that discussed here ( see sanders 2005 ) .",
    "this process may also partly explain the metallicity ridges observed around the central regions of some cool core galaxy clusters ( sanders 2005 ; sanders 2009 ; million 2010 ) .",
    "we note that bumps in the fe abundance profiles are not clearly observed to the south . however , the mean fe abundance is larger in the south than in the north and a cold front is located at a similar radius ( simionescu 2007 , 2010 ) , making the identification of such a bump more difficult .",
    "our results support the rising and pancaking bubble simulations presented in churazov ( 2001 ; see also brggen & kaiser 2002 ; kaiser 2003 ; brggen 2003 ; ruzkowski 2004a , b ; heinz & churazov 2005 ) .",
    "utilizing a detailed , spatially - resolved spectral mapping and an ultra - deep ( 574 ks ) _ chandra _ observation of m87 and the central regions of the virgo cluster , we present an unprecedented , close - up view of agn feedback in action .",
    "our maps reveal x - ray bright arms that have been lifted up by buoyant radio bubbles as relatively cool , low entropy features that are rich in structure ( see belsole 2001 ; molendi 2002 ) .",
    "the detailed properties of these arms are discussed in paper i. outside the arms , the ambient cluster gas is strikingly isothermal at each radius .",
    "this suggests that either the gas remains relatively undisturbed by agn uplift or that conduction is efficient along the azimuthal direction , as expected under action of the heat - flux buoyancy instability ( hbi ) .",
    "many cavities are seen in the inner radio cocoon ( @xmath1 arcsec or @xmath2 kpc ) including one located at @xmath109 arcsec ( @xmath110 kpc ) from the central agn in the counter - jet direction .",
    "these cavities are associated with decreased surface brightness , high temperatures , low thermal pressure , and typically appear filled with radio plasma in projection .",
    "our pressure map confirms spectrally previous results on the presence of a circular shock front at @xmath17 arcsec ( 14 kpc ) .",
    "based on the surface brightness jump , we measure an average mach number of @xmath5 for the shock at @xmath17 arcsec , in good agreement with the analysis of forman ( 2007 ) . under the assumption of a linearly rising temperature profile",
    ", we also measure a temperature jump within the @xmath1 arcsec thick shock , consistent with the expectations for a shock with mach number @xmath5 .",
    "the thickness and overall weakness of these shocks will make it difficult to detect temperature jumps unambiguously in hotter clusters like perseus ( fabian 2006 ; graham 2008 ) .",
    "another shock , associated with the central radio cocoon , is observed at @xmath1 arcsec ( @xmath2 kpc ) .",
    "because of the complexity of this region , we can only estimate the mach number of this shock , using the observed projected temperature jump across the front .",
    "this suggests a mach number of @xmath6 .",
    "the relative distances and mach numbers of these shocks suggest that agn outbursts are common and occur every @xmath7 myrs .",
    "our results show that a significant mass of metals is lifted up to large radius in the wake of the radio bubbles .",
    "at least @xmath111 of fe is uplifted to a radius of @xmath8 arcsec ( 2731 kpc ) to the north of the agn . given that a similar amount of fe ( @xmath112 ) is present in the x - ray bright arms ( simionescu 2008 ) , a single generation of bubbles can , in principle , explain the observed fe excess .",
    "it is still uncertain how much metal falls towards the central regions after this process occurs .",
    "fe uplift of this magnitude may explain the observed metallicity ridges observed around some cool core clusters",
