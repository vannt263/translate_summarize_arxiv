    "sasers are devices capable of producing beams of coherent phonons . besides the system considered here , several other kinds of such devices were proposed and constructed @xcite .    in recent works @xcite the kinetics and the dynamical properties of the double barrier phonon laser",
    "were discussed . in this paper",
    "we study the system from a point of view close to that used in quantum optics to study the onset of the lasing regime . in spite of the fact that the system is far from equilibrium and thus concepts like temperature and chemical potential",
    "can not be applied , the process is analogous to a phase transition @xcite .",
    "this transition is not governed by temperature but an energy flux ( in this case by the injection rate of primary longitudinal optical @xmath1 phonons ) .",
    "we were able to obtain the potential that describes the states of our system and consequently , the threshold value for the coherent transversal acoustic ( @xmath0 ) phonon emission .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a description of the saser device is presented in section [ the system ] .",
    "the multimode case is analyzed in section [ multimode ] . in section [ single mode ]",
    "the potential that describes our system is obtained .",
    "finally , in section [ results ] we present our results and conclusions .",
    "the phonon laser studied here consists of an _ algaas / gaas _ double - barrier heterostructure ( dbh ) .",
    "this device was designed in such a way that , for a small applied bias @xmath4 , the difference @xmath5 between the first excited level @xmath6 and the ground state @xmath7 in the well is less than the longitudinal optical ( @xmath1 ) phonon energy @xmath8 . for a greater bias",
    "the resonant condition @xmath9 is achieved and the electrons begin to decay to the ground state by emitting primary @xmath1 phonons . for an @xmath10 concentration greater than @xmath11 @xcite or @xmath12 @xcite , these phonons are confined inside the well ( they can be also absorbed by exciting electrons from @xmath7 to @xmath6 ) .",
    "the process described above , acts in parallel with the decay of primary @xmath1 phonons due to anharmonicity .",
    "one of the products of this decay is a secondary longitudinal optical phonon ( @xmath2 ) , the other is a @xmath0 phonon @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath0 pair is produced by stimulated emission .",
    "therefore these @xmath0 phonons could be coherent and form a beam that it is called saser by analogy with a laser .",
    "the dbh saser beam could be applied to acoustic nanoscopy , phonoelectronics and phonolitography .",
    "this was discussed in more detail in a previous article @xcite .    the potential profile and",
    "the level positions at the resonant condition are shown in figure [ profile - fig1 ] .    , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the barriers and well widths and the fermi level at the emitter . ]",
    "the fundamental mechanism in this saser is the generation of the @xmath0 phonons due to the decay of primary @xmath1 phonons .",
    "therefore , the other processes ( i.e. , emission - absorption of the @xmath1 phonon through electron transitions and the @xmath2 phonon decay ) are secondary and are taken into account just as a result of the interaction of each phonon with its reservoir .    as the @xmath0 phonon emission results from the decay of @xmath1 phonons , they could be emitted in many modes , corresponding to the different values of its wave vector @xmath16 parallel to the interface .",
    "the number @xmath17 of wave vectors parallel to the interface can be estimated as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the device area and @xmath20 is the lattice parameter . for the values used here , @xmath21 and @xmath22  , @xmath17 is of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "the total number of emitted @xmath0 phonons is @xmath24 @xcite , which means that , at the beginning of the phonon emission , the number of phonons per wave vector @xmath16 is @xmath25 . as the applied bias increases ,",
    "the emission in a particular mode called @xmath26 grow slowly until a certain threshold value @xmath27 is reached . for values of @xmath4 greater than @xmath28 ,",
    "the phonons in that mode are emitted in a coherent way implying that the population @xmath29 is the only one macroscopically non zero . in this section ,",
    "the possibility of macroscopically coexistence of more than one mode is studied .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes our system can be written as :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath16 are respectively the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath0 wave vectors parallel to the interfaces , and must satisfy @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath37 are the energies of each kind of phonons and @xmath38 is the phonon - phonon interaction coefficient .      the equations of motion for the operators @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are obtained from the hamiltonian ( [ h_total ] ) .",
    "we remark that the saser system is coupled to reservoirs .",
    "the @xmath33 phonons are coupled through the emission and absorption processes to the electron system . in the case of the @xmath2 phonons , they are coupled to the other phonon modes to which they decay , whereas the @xmath0 phonons are connected to the other @xmath0 phonon modes outside the well . thus the total hamiltonian includes , besides the terms shown in equation ( [ h_total ] ) , the interaction with the reservoirs . by using the methods described in references @xcite",
    ", the reservoir coordinates can be eliminated leading to the following langevin equations    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the emission and absorption rates for the @xmath1 phonons due the interaction with its reservoir ( i.e. , the electrons ) , @xmath46 is the decay rate of @xmath2 phonons , @xmath47 is the escape rate of the @xmath0 phonons and @xmath48 are the fluctuation forces .",
    "the @xmath0 phonons escape rate is different for each mode , thus depending on @xmath49 .",
    "as we are not interested in studying the statistical properties of the saser , in the following the fluctuation forces will not be considered .    in order to obtain only one equation for the @xmath0 phonons",
    ", we make the adiabatic approximation in equations ( [ langevin11 ] ) and ( [ langevin12 ] ) .",
    "first we replace @xmath50 and @xmath51 in ( [ langevin12 ] ) .",
    "secondly , we integrate ( [ langevin12 ] ) explicitly to get    @xmath52 \\left ( { t-\\tau } \\right ) } \\left (   { \\tilde b_{{\\bf q}_{1}}\\tilde b_{{\\bf q}_{3}}^{\\dagger } } \\right )",
    "_ { \\tau } d\\tau .",
    "\\label{integra - b2}\\ ] ]    assuming that the relaxation time of the @xmath53 phonons is much smaller than the relaxation of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we can take @xmath56 out of the integral in equation ( [ integra - b2 ] ) obtaining    @xmath57    where @xmath58 .    in a similar way",
    ", we obtain for @xmath39    @xmath59    where @xmath60 finally , we replace ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ n1 ] ) in ( [ langevin13 ] ) and we get , after some manipulations , an equation for the @xmath0 phonon populations    @xmath61    where @xmath62 .    considering as an example only two modes , @xmath26 and @xmath63 , we get for the stationary case of equation ( [ dn3 ] ) :    @xmath64    if both modes would be present , ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) both parenthesis in ( [ mode1 ] ) and ( [ mode2 ] ) would be zero .",
    "this is a contradiction ( because @xmath67 ) .",
    "this contradiction only can be solved if just one mode is present and the other one has died out . therefore , only a single mode , the one with largest lifetime inside the well and closest to resonance , survives .",
    "the former analysis also can be done quite rigorously for many modes .    when the @xmath1 decay , the @xmath0 phonons are emitted in the [ @xmath68 direction @xcite .",
    "the device is grown in this direction , such that the @xmath0 phonon beam will make multiple reflections between the walls of the well , implying in large lifetime for these phonons .",
    "indeed , for a small applied bias , the @xmath0 phonons are emitted with any wave vector @xmath16 . in this regime ,",
    "the device works as a sound emitting diode ( sed ) . with a further increase in the applied potential , when a certain value of @xmath4 is reached ,",
    "the @xmath0 phonon distribution on @xmath16 become more and more sharp giving place to a phase transition . in this case @xmath69",
    "grows suddenly from about @xmath70 to about @xmath71 .",
    "thus , a great number of @xmath0 phonons would have only one mode : @xmath72 ( which imply @xmath73 ) .",
    "this mode will survive and slave the others , making the system to self - organize and emit just in this mode .",
    "in order to get the threshold for which @xmath69 begins to be macroscopically non zero , we must first obtain an equation for the amplitude of the single mode @xmath74 that slaves the system . to do that",
    ", we make the same approximations as described in the previous section .",
    "the equation obtained for @xmath74 is    @xmath75    where @xmath76 .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ db3 ] ) can be obtained from the potential :    @xmath77    with @xmath78 such that    @xmath79    the expressions for the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 are @xcite    @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the electron transition rate and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are respectively the electron populations of the fundamental and excited levels .",
    "the shape of the potential ( [ potential - b3 ] ) is similar to that obtained in the ginzburg - landau phase transition theory . for @xmath86",
    "the potential has a minimum at @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) . in the case of @xmath89 ,",
    "the minimum is obtained for @xmath90 .",
    "the transition from @xmath86 to @xmath89 is due to the competition between processes of gain , with a rate @xmath91 and losses , with a rate @xmath92 .",
    "the threshold is attained when @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "the parameters used in our calculation are : the escape rate of @xmath0 phonons @xmath95 , estimated from its group velocity near the @xmath96 point of the brillouin zone , the decay rate of the @xmath2 phonons @xmath97 ( by assuming a small stimulated decay ) and the phonon - phonon interaction coefficient @xmath98 calculated in reference @xcite following the work of klemens @xcite .",
    "the decay rate @xmath99 obtained from this value is in agreement with the experimental result of valle @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 depend on the @xmath1 phonon emission rate @xmath83 and on the electron populations @xmath84 and @xmath85 that were calculated in reference @xcite by solving the kinetic equations .",
    "the total generation rate of the @xmath1 phonons @xmath80 , depends on the applied bias @xmath4 ( i.e. , it turns out from electron transitions that are @xmath4 dependent @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the applied bias is the external parameter that control the intensity of the saser emission .      in figure [ potential - fig2 ] ,",
    "the potential ( [ potential - b3 ] ) is plotted as a function of the @xmath0 phonon amplitude for different values of the applied bias @xmath4 .",
    "as it can be seen , for @xmath100 this potential has different minima for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "these minima represent the stable points @xmath101 of the system .      in figure [ n3-fig3 ]",
    "the stable points are plotted as function of @xmath4 .",
    "the solid line represents the @xmath102 calculated in this work .",
    "the dashed line is the @xmath0 phonon population calculated in a previous work from the kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "figure [ comparison - fig4 ] shows a comparison in the region where the @xmath0 generation begins ( dashed region in figure [ n3-fig3 ] ) . from this comparison",
    "two conclusions arise .",
    "first , as it can be seen ( solid line ) , the @xmath0 coherent emission does not start until a certain threshold of the applied bias is reached . at @xmath28 the @xmath1 emission rate @xmath80 is of the order of @xmath104 and the total @xmath0 phonon population @xmath105 is @xmath106 , whereas @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath0 phonons generated for a bias greater than @xmath28 are coherent .",
    "secondly , our previous calculations @xcite , even without considering the self - organization process , gave results that agree quite well with those presented here .",
    "this results show that the coherent emission occurs immediately after the condition of @xmath1 phonon emission is reached .",
    "that means that it is not necessary a big ",
    "optical \" pumping to get a sasing region . in summary , we show in this work that the @xmath0 phonons , produced by stimulated emission , constitute a coherent phonon beam in the parameter region discussed above .",
