    "let us first quickly describe the universal algebraic background .",
    "a _ signature _ ( or _ similarity type _ ) consists of a set  @xmath8 , together with a map @xmath9 ( the _ arity map _ ) .",
    "an _ algebra _ is a structure @xmath10 , where  @xmath11 is a nonempty set and for each @xmath12 , the `` fundamental operation '' @xmath13 is a map from  @xmath14 to  @xmath11 , identified with the unique constant in its range in case  @xmath15 . a _ congruence _ of  @xmath16 is an equivalence relation on  @xmath11 which is compatible with all the fundamental operations of  @xmath16 .",
    "the set  @xmath17 of all congruences of  @xmath16 forms an _ algebraic lattice _ under set inclusion , and we denote by @xmath18 its semilattice of compact elements .",

    "variety of algebras _ is the class of all the algebras satisfying a given set of identities ( in a given signature ) .",
    "many combinatorial features of the work under discussion in the present paper are contained in the notion of _ critical point _ between varieties of algebras .",
    "the following definition was introduced in the survey paper tma and wehrung  @xcite , then slightly amended in gillibert  @xcite . for a class  @xmath20 of algebras , we set @xmath21 the _ compact congruence class _ of  @xmath20 .",
