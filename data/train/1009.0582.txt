    "deeply virtual exclusive leptoproduction of photons and mesons ( dvcs and dvmp ) can be described in terms of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) .",
    "these provide a holographic view into the nucleon structure . with measurements of polarization and angular asymmetries",
    ", a general parameterization requires 8 quark - nucleon spin - dependent gpds and a corresponding number of gluon - nucleon gpds ( for a review , see ref  [ ] ) .",
    "the basic definition of the quark - nucleon gpds is through off - forward matrix elements of quark field correlators , @xmath2 where we write the dirac indices explicitly .",
    "contracting with the dirac matrices , @xmath3 or @xmath4 and integrating over the internal quark momenta gives rise to the chiral even gpds @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively . on the other hand , contracting with @xmath7 yields 4 chiral odd gpds , which have been chosen in ref .",

    "[ oddgpd ] , @xmath11    we have constructed a robust model for the gpds , extending previous work  [ ] that is based on the parameterization of diquark spectators and regge behavior at small @xmath12 .",
    "the gpd model parameters are constrained by their relations to pdfs , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and to nucleon form factors @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 through the first @xmath20 moments of @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "these are all normalized to the corresponding charge , anomalous moment , axial charge and pseudoscalar `` charge '' , respectively . for chiral odd gpds there are fewer constraints",
    ". @xmath22 can be fit to the loose constraints in ref .  [ ] - the first moment of @xmath23 is the `` tensor form factor '' , called @xmath24 by hgler  [ ] .",
    "further , it is conjectured that the first moment of @xmath25 is a `` transverse anomalous moment '' , @xmath26 , with the latter defined by burkardt  [ ] .    with our _ ansatz",
    "_ many observables can be determined in parallel with corresponding regge predictions . since the initial work  [ ] , we have undertaken a more extensive parameterization , and presented several new predictions . here",
    "we show one example - the transversely polarized target asymmetry , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that will be explained below .    ,",
    "vs. @xmath27 , at @xmath28 gev@xmath29 , @xmath30 for different values of the tensor charge , @xmath31 , with fixed @xmath32 , _",
    "i.e. _ equal to the central value extracted in a global fit  [ ] . ]    in the case of @xmath33 production there are important constraints that restrict the gpds that contribute .",
    "consider the @xmath0-channel quantum numbers corresponding to combinations of gpds .",
    "the @xmath20 moments of the gpds have expansions in terms of @xmath0-dependent form factors and polynomials in @xmath34 .",
    "it has been shown by lebed and ji for pdfs  [ ] and haegler for gpds  [ ] ( see also ref .  ) , that these moments have @xmath0-channel angular momentum decompositions , as appropriate for @xmath0-channel exchanges , as well as regge poles . from the @xmath35channel perspective @xmath36 , which has c - parity negative , goes into a @xmath37 pair ( actually a non - local pair of field operators that have an operator product expansion and mellin moments ) , which subsequently becomes an @xmath38 system . in that chain ,",
    "each part has the same @xmath1 .",
    "consider first the chiral even gpds . in the table",
    "we show the relevant crossing ( anti-)symmetric combinations of the gpds .",
    "the crossing odd @xmath39 has contributions from @xmath40 and higher .",
    "there are several different reasons that this gpd is not expected to contribute at leading order .",
    "there can not be a @xmath41 coupling to @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 appears in the triplet spin with l=2 . for simple resonance exchanges",
    ", there would be an angular momentum barrier compared to the @xmath45 exchanges . in regge language",
    "the trajectory with @xmath44 is non - leading even signature and the absence of @xmath41 would require a `` nonsense '' factor killing the pole , thereby suppressing the effect in the physical region .",
    "furthermore , there is no well established @xmath44 isoscalar or isovector ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) meson below mass of 2 gev / c@xmath29 , although there is a nearly degenerate pair , @xmath48 with a @xmath49 .",
    "since these can be categorized as @xmath50 , then the @xmath44 would lie in this region of masses .",
    "this puts the regge trajectory going through @xmath51 at @xmath52 , which will lie well below the @xmath46 and lower than @xmath53 and @xmath54 , minimizing its importance at small @xmath20 as well .",
    "the crossing odd @xmath55 has contributions from @xmath56 etc .",
    ", so it is the leading candidate for chiral even gpds that contribute to @xmath33 .",
    "its first moment is the pseudoscalar form factor , for    which the main contribution is the @xmath57 itself .",
    "however , for the neutral @xmath57 this is not the case - there is no @xmath57 pole because there is no @xmath58 coupling .",
    "how does this effect the @xmath33 production ? it should be said that the role of the charged pion pole in the gpd is not settled in any case , so its contribution to charged @xmath57 production is not agreed upon .",
    "our approach is that the pole would be included in the gpd , as in the review of goeke , @xmath59  [ ] , rather than providing a separate contribution to the amplitudes , as in ref .",
    "that being said , in @xmath33 the non - pole contribution to the form factor is relevant .",
    "how do we estimate that ?",
    "the electroweak form factors of the nucleon include @xmath60 , the axial vector form factor , and @xmath61 , the  induced pseudoscalar \" . hence for the axial electroweak current , @xmath62 u(p),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , and the choice of the muon mass to make the @xmath64 dimensionless follows convention ( the best experimental values of the induced pseudoscalar form factor come from @xmath65 capture ) .",
    "the divergence of the isovector part of the axial current is approximated in pcac by the pion pole - the goldberger - treiman relation for @xmath66 in terms of the @xmath57-nucleon coupling constant . for non - zero @xmath67",
    "there is a relation between the two form factors , @xmath68 now @xmath39 integrates to @xmath60 ; @xmath55 integrates to @xmath69 , proportional to the above pseudoscalar form factor of the nucleon .",
    "recent experimental determinations show that @xmath70 and @xmath71  [ ] . for @xmath33 electroproduction on the nucleon , however , there is no @xmath33 exchange .",
    "the difference between @xmath64 from eq .",
    "[ gtreln ] and experiment is a measure of the non - pole contribution , which is quite small   [ ] .",
    "thence , the size of @xmath33 electroproduction cross sections would be expected to be considerably less than charged @xmath57 s if @xmath55 were the major contribution ( see for example ref .  [ ] , where an estimate is based on a chiral - soliton model ) .",
    "the measured cross section for @xmath33 is sizable and has large transverse @xmath72 contributions .",
    "this indicates that the main contributions should come from chiral odd gpds , for which the @xmath0-channel decomposition is richer . in particular ,",
    "because these gpds arise from the dirac matrices @xmath73 , there are 2 series of @xmath1 values for each gpd  [ ] corresponding to space - space or time - space combinations - @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these series occur for 3 of the 4 chiral odd gpds , the exception being @xmath76 .",
    "we are thus led to the conclusion that chiral odd gpds will dominate the neutral pseudoscalar leptoproduction cross sections .",
    "this result has interesting consequences .",
    "for one thing , in a factorized handbag picture , these gpds will couple to the hard part , the @xmath77 providing the @xmath33 couples through @xmath78 , which is naively twist 3 , rather than the twist 2 @xmath79 .",
    "nevertheless , the previous arguments support this choice .",
    "secondly the vector @xmath74 and axial vector @xmath75 in the @xmath0-channel , viewed as particles ( @xmath80 ) , couple primarily to the transverse virtual photon . for reggeons ,",
    "the @xmath74 does not couple at all to the longitudinal photon , while the axial vector @xmath75 does through helicity flip  [ ] .",
    "guided by these observations  [ ] , we assume the hard part depends on whether the exchange quantum numbers are in the vector or axial vector series , thereby introducing orbital angular momentum into the model .",
    "we use @xmath81 dependent electromagnetic `` transition '' form factors for vector or axial vector quantum numbers going to a pion .",
    "we calculate these using pqcd for @xmath82 and a standard @xmath83dependent pion wave function , convoluted in an impact parameter representation that allows orbital excitations to be easily implemented .    with our model for the chiral odd , spin - dependent gpds and these transition form factors ,",
    "we can obtain the full range of cross sections and asymmetries in kinematic regimes that coincide with ongoing jlab experiments .",
    "we are able to predict the important transverse photon contributions to the observables  [ ] . in figures 1 and 2 we show two examples of predictions that depend on the values of the tensor charges , thereby providing a means to narrow down those important quantities .",
    "preliminary versions of this program have been presented and further details will soon appear .",
    "a similar emphasis on chiral odd contributions for @xmath57 electroproduction has recently been proposed  [ ] , although the details of that model are quite different from ours .    , vs. @xmath84 , at @xmath28 gev@xmath29 , @xmath85 for different values of the tensor charge , @xmath31 , with fixed @xmath32 , _",
    "i.e. _ equal to the central value extracted in a global fit  [ ] . ]",
    "at the heart our understanding of the role of gpds in exclusive leptoproduction reactions are the analyticity properties of the amplitudes .",
    "we have examined the applicability of dispersion relations ( drs ) to the gpd formulation of dvcs .",
    "unitarity and completeness are crucial ingredients in establishing analytic properties of the amplitudes .",
    "the amplitudes are analytic in energy variables , which allows the amplitudes ( `` compton form factors '' or cff s ) to satisfy drs relating real and imaginary parts .",
    "the imaginary part of a cff is given by the gpd evaluated at the kinematic point where the returning quark has only transverse momentum relative to the nucleon direction .",
    "then the dr can determine the real part thereby .",
    "however , at non - zero momentum transfer the drs require integration over unphysical regions of the variables and that region is considerable - the real parts must still be measured by using interference with the bethe - heitler contribution  [ ] .    we have also investigated the analyticity in the @xmath86 region ( the erbl region ) , which conventionally is described as a quark - antiquark or meson distribution in the proton .",
    "we extended the derivation of the parton model from connected matrix elements for non - local quark and gluon field operators in inclusive hard processes  [ ] to the non - forward gpds  [ ] . at leading twist ,",
    "the kinematics require semi - disconnected amplitudes , _",
    "i.e. _ vacuum fluctuations , that vitiate the partonic interpretation . in order to restore the sensible partonic picture it is necessary to include gluon exchange , appearing as an initial or final state interaction that `` dresses '' the struck or returning quark .",
    "spin dependent gpds enable a qcd based look into the parton angular momentum distributions that constitute the nucleon structure .",
    "dvcs depends on chiral even gpds that involve longitudinal asymmetries . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath33 electroproduction provides a window into transversity via chiral odd gpds , which are essential to understand the importance of transverse @xmath72 .",
    "the transverse photon cross sections and asymmetries are major components of electroproduction observables .",
    "a broad vista of spin phenomenology is opened up by our careful modeling of gpds , as we have explained .    in a more general study of the analyticity of gpds",
    ", we presented the problem with the partonic interpretation of the erbl region of gpd kinematics .",
    "this work is ongoing , and suggests an important connection between partonic distributions and final state interactions .",
