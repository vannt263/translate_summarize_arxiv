    "the three - nucleon continuum is an excellent testing ground for nuclear interactions , since both precise experiments and theoretical calculations are possible  @xcite . comparisons between measured three - nucleon observables and theoretical calculations provide stringent tests of the underlying nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and three - nucleon ( 3n ) interactions .",
    "proton - deuteron elastic scattering at low energies offers two particular advantages : highly accurate experiments can be performed for a large number of observables , and theoretical calculations are simplified due to the energy being below the deuteron breakup threshold and the relatively low number of partial waves required .",
    "past experimental studies have focussed on the differential cross section and analyzing powers for p - d scattering at @xmath8  mev , just below the deuteron breakup threshold  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of these p - d scattering observables using realistic nn and 3n interactions are now routinely possible  @xcite .",
    "the calculations are found to reproduce the differential cross section and tensor analyzing powers ( taps ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 quite well , while the vector analyzing powers ( vaps ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 are underpredicted by @xmath9 .",
    "the available 3n forces are found to have little influence , except for the @xmath10 partial wave  @xcite .",
    "the situation in neutron - deuteron scattering is similar  @xcite , although only the cross section and @xmath0 have been measured to date at low energies . by far the most glaring difference between theory and experiment",
    "is in the vaps , a discrepancy which has come to be known as the `` @xmath11 puzzle ''  @xcite .",
    "this puzzle has been in existence for about ten years now , and the resolution is still unclear .",
    "it has been suggested that the discrepancy arises from inadequacies in the nn potential in the @xmath12 waves  @xcite .",
    "other workers have considered the role of 3n force effects  @xcite .",
    "so far , no conclusive solution to the problem has been found , although most recent attention has been focussed on the role of the 3n interaction  @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to determine these observables at energies below @xmath8  mev , as the influence of higher partial waves is strongly reduced , allowing the dominant @xmath13- and @xmath14-waves to be investigated with greater clarity .",
    "also , when faced with disagreement between theory and experiment , it is interesting to study the energy dependence of the discrepancy , since this may provide clues as to its origin .",
    "new data will place strong constraints on any proposed solution .",
    "there is also considerable interest in obtaining low - energy data for the determination of the p - d scattering lengths  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present measurements of the differential cross section and analyzing powers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath15 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for p - d scattering at @xmath5  kev .",
    "these data are the first complete set of observables measured at such a low energy ; previously only cross section  @xcite and @xmath0 data  @xcite have been obtained in this energy range .",
    "we also present an energy excitation function of @xmath6 from @xmath5  kev up to 2000  kev .",
    "some of the data presented here have appeared previously in brief publications  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the differential cross section and the analyzing powers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 were carried out at the triangle universities nuclear laboratory ( tunl ) .",
    "the analyzing power @xmath4 was deduced from measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath16 . achieving a center - of - mass energy of 431.3  kev",
    "requires either a 650-kev proton beam incident on a deuteron target , or a 1300-kev deuteron beam incident on a proton target ( the small corrections for energy loss in the target will be discussed later ) .",
    "the beams , targets , and detection methods are discussed below .",
    "beams of 650-kev protons were used for measurements of differential cross sections and @xmath0 . polarized or unpolarized",
    "beams of 72-kev @xmath17 ions were produced by the tunl atomic beam polarized ion source  @xcite .",
    "these ions were then accelerated to 450  kev by the minitandem accelerator  @xcite .",
    "the final energy of 650  kev for the now positive ions was achieved by the @xmath18-kv bias on the 107-cm - diameter scattering chamber  @xcite where the measurements were performed .",
    "unpolarized proton beams were produced by bleeding hydrogen gas into the ionizer of the ion source .",
    "when polarized proton beams were used , a wien filter downstream from the ion source was utilized to set the spin - quantization axis vertical in the laboratory .",
    "two spin states were used , with polarizations @xmath19 .",
    "the desired hyperfine states of atomic hydrogen were cycled approximately every second .",
    "this technique minimizes the effects of slow changes in beam position , target thickness , or amplifier gain on the measured analyzing powers .",
    "proton beam polarization was determined using the @xmath20 reaction in a polarimeter  @xcite located at the rear of the scattering chamber .",
    "the polarization was measured several times throughout the measurements at an incident proton energy of 450  kev by lowering the chamber bias voltage .",
    "the proton polarization was found to be constant within @xmath21 throughout the measurements ; the systematic error in the proton polarization is estimated to be @xmath22 .    the energy calibration of the proton beam produced by the minitandem and high - voltage chamber system has been established to @xmath23  kev , using the 240.0- and 340.5-kev resonances in @xmath24 and the 405.4- and 445.8-kev resonances in @xmath25 .",
    "the resonance energies were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "polarized beams of 72-kev @xmath26 ions were produced using the same atomic - beam polarized ion source  @xcite used for protons .",
    "the beam was injected into the tunl fn  tandem accelerator , magnetically analyzed , and then delivered to a 62-cm diameter scattering chamber .",
    "the same wien filter mentioned previously was used to control the spin - quantization axis on target .",
    "the spin axis was longitudinal for the @xmath2 measurements , normal to the reaction plane for @xmath1 and @xmath16 , and @xmath27 offset from longitudinal in the reaction plane for @xmath3 .",
    "three deuteron beam polarization states were produced with the atomic beam polarized ion source : a maximum positive , a maximum negative , and an unpolarized state .",
    "the tap data were obtained with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , while beams with @xmath30 and @xmath31 were used for the @xmath1 measurements .",
    "the spin states were also cycled approximately once every second . the beam polarization for the tap data",
    "was determined using the @xmath32 reaction in an online polarimeter located behind the scattering chamber  @xcite .",
    "deuteron beam vector polarization was determined online via the @xmath33 reaction in a different polarimeter located behind the scattering chamber .",
    "the effective @xmath1 for this reaction at @xmath34  mev has been calibrated relative to the @xmath32 polarimeter at @xmath35  mev . more information on the use of the @xmath33 reaction for deuteron vector polarimetry is available in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath36 measurements the polarization was very stable over time , and was monitored periodically with the @xmath32 polarimeter at @xmath35  mev .",
    "the absolute uncertainty in all of the deuteron beam polarizations is estimated to @xmath21 .",
    "the unpolarized deuteron and proton beams used for the @xmath37 cross section measurements were produced by a direct extraction negative ion source .",
    "the energy calibration of the beams produced by the fn  tandem is determined within @xmath38 from the magnetic field in the @xmath39 bending magnet , measured by an nmr magnetometer .",
    "the magnetometer was calibrated using the @xmath40 threshold ( @xmath41  kev  @xcite ) and the @xmath42 threshold ( @xmath43  kev  @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements were performed by bombarding thin hydrogenated or deuterated carbon foils .",
    "the targets used for analyzing power measurements consisted of approximately @xmath44 and @xmath45 hydrogen isotope and carbon atoms/@xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the targets used for the relative and absolute cross section measurements consisted of approximately @xmath47 and @xmath48 hydrogen isotope and carbon atoms/@xmath46 , respectively . in order to calculate the energy loss in the targets it is necessary to know their carbon and hydrogen isotope thickness and the stopping power .",
    "the carbon content was determined by comparison with carbon foils of known thickness while the hydrogen thickness was determined either from the d - p elastic scattering cross section , or from the p - p elastic scattering cross section . for the analyzing power measurements the beam - energy loss in the targets is @xmath49  kev , while for the cross section measurements , the beam - energy loss was @xmath50  kev . in all cases",
    "the incident energy was adjusted so that the mean energy in the center of the target corresponded to @xmath51  kev . here",
    "the quoted error includes the uncertainties in the incident energy and also the energy loss in the target .",
    "it should be noted that the use of thin targets is very important at low energies for minimizing energy loss and straggling effects .",
    "the differential cross section is particularly sensitive to the energy , a point which will be discussed quantitatively later in this paper .",
    "the reaction products were detected using 100-@xmath52m - thick si surface barrier detectors .",
    "left - right symmetric detector configurations were utilized for all of the measurements .",
    "count rates in the detectors were controlled by varying the solid angle ( 0.2 - 5  msr ) and beam current ( 10 - 150  na ) . in some cases , thin mylar foils ( 2 - 5  @xmath52 m ) were placed over the detectors to either ( 1 ) increase the energy separation between proton and deuteron peaks or ( 2 ) stop heavy recoils resulting from @xmath53 , @xmath54 , or @xmath55 reactions .",
    "measurements at far forward angles in the laboratory are limited by the high flux of elastic - scattered particles from carbon . for the proton - beam measurements in the high - voltage scattering chamber ,",
    "detector signals were sent to ground potential via fiber - optic connections .    for the cross section , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath16 measurements",
    "the elastic scattering yields were determined from the energy spectra .",
    "sample energy spectra are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : spec_pond]-[fig : spec_donp2 ] .",
    "it should be noted that the low - energy heavy recoils seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : spec_donp1 ] and  [ fig : spec_donp2 ] can be eliminated if necessary by using the aforementioned mylar foils .",
    "the primary background under the p - d elastic scattering peaks at all angles is the low - energy tail from carbon elastic scattering .",
    "pulsers were inserted into the detector electronics to facilitate dead - time corrections , which were typically less than 5% but always less than 10% .",
    "peak yields were extracted using linear least - squares fits to the background on either side of the peak . for the analyzing power measurements ,",
    "the background subtraction and dead - time corrections were performed separately for each spin state .",
    "a different technique was used for the vaps @xmath0 and @xmath1 since the magnitudes of these observables are roughly a factor of 10 smaller than for the taps .",
    "the scattered deuterons and protons were detected in coincidence using two pairs of silicon surface barrier detectors placed at symmetric angles on either side of the incident beam .",
    "the angles of the detectors were set to observe either protons or deuterons in the more forward detectors in coincidence with deuterons or protons detected in the more backward detector on the opposite side of the beam .",
    "a major benefit of this method is that data can be acquired at a much higher rate because the events resulting from carbon elastic scattering are essentially completely eliminated .",
    "note that a factor of 10 reduction in magnitude of the analyzing power requires a factor of 100 increase in the number of counts if the same relative statistical accuracy is desired .",
    "an additional advantage of the technique is that the background under the peak of interest is much reduced , lowering the possibility of false asymmetries resulting from the asymmetry in the background .",
    "histograms of the time difference between the fast timing signals from each coincident pair of detectors were stored for each spin state .",
    "the time resolution for the coincident proton - deuteron peaks was @xmath56  ns , with backgrounds @xmath57 .",
    "a sample time spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_tac ] .",
    "dead - time corrections ( @xmath57 ) were determined by sending test pulses to the detector preamplifiers with time delays adjusted to give distinct peaks in the time spectra .",
    "peak yields for each spin state were extracted using linear least - squares fits to the background on either side of the peak , and were corrected for dead time . the possible influence of channel ( time ) dependent dead - time corrections was calculated and found to be negligible .",
    "the incident beam energy was adjusted to yield @xmath5  kev in center of the target , except for the @xmath36 measurements where the incident deuteron energy varied over @xmath58  mev .",
    "the beams were collimated to produce a 2  mm  ( horizontal )  @xmath59  4  mm  ( vertical ) beamspot on the center of the target .",
    "the @xmath60 position for each detector was determined by measuring the elastic scattering from carbon on either side of the beam for angles near @xmath60 . the systematic uncertainty in the angular positioning is estimated to be @xmath61 .",
    "the number of incident particles was determined by beam current integration . for the analyzing power data and relative cross section data the targets",
    "were replaced approximately every 12  hours , or when the hydrogen isotope content decreased by @xmath62% .",
    "relative cross sections were determined with a proton beam in the high - voltage scattering chamber .",
    "the measurements were performed using a movable pair of left - right symmetric detectors , and a fixed pair located out of the plane of the other detectors at @xmath63 .",
    "the yield of protons and deuterons from p - d elastic scattering in the fixed pair was used to normalize the yields in the movable pair .",
    "absolute p - d cross sections were determined relative to the proton - proton elastic scattering cross section at a nominal proton beam energy of 2600  kev .",
    "detector pairs were placed at @xmath64 and @xmath65 where both cross sections vary smoothly with angle .",
    "these angles give d - p elastic scattering measurements at @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . a direct extraction negative ion source was used to inject beam into the tandem accelerator for these measurements .",
    "the beam could be switched between 1300-kev deuterons to 2600-kev protons in about one minute by only adjusting two parameters : ( 1 ) the magnetic field in the bending magnet between the source and the accelerator , and ( 2 ) changing the accelerator terminal voltage .",
    "note that the magnetic field in the @xmath39 analyzing magnet , which defines the beam energy , is unchanged throughout this procedure .",
    "the deuteron and proton beams were switched several times for each target , using an integrated charge of @xmath69  @xmath52c per measurement .",
    "for these measurements accurate relative beam current integration is essential .",
    "current was integrated from the target rod ( biased to @xmath70  v ) and a plate at the rear of the chamber ( suppressed by a shroud at @xmath71  v ) . as a test of the technique",
    ", we also measured using the same procedure @xmath72 and @xmath73 elastic scattering at @xmath74 , where the cross sections are described to a very high accuracy by the rutherford formula . a target consisting of @xmath75 au atoms/@xmath46",
    "was utilized for these measurements .",
    "the results agreed within 0.8% with the ratio expected for rutherford scattering ( @xmath76 corrections due to electron screening  @xcite were taken into account ) .",
    "the relative cross section data as a function of center - of - mass angle are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rel_sig ] .",
    "these data have been normalized to the absolute cross section measurements .",
    "absolute p - d cross sections were determined at @xmath64 and @xmath65 relative to the p - p scattering measurements at a nominal proton beam energy of 2600  kev .",
    "the p - p cross section for these energies and angles appears to be well understood .",
    "our procedure is to utilize the nijmegen energy - dependent partial - wave analysis  @xcite to generate cross sections for our energy and angles .",
    "a thorough discussion of the data upon which this analysis is based is given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the p - p cross section data for @xmath77  mev which are included in the nijmegen analysis generally have absolute uncertainties @xmath78 and are reproduced by the fit within this error . in addition there are the p - p cross section data of knecht , dahl , and messelt  @xcite which include measurements at @xmath79  kev , very close to the energy of the present experiment .",
    "the quoted experimental uncertainties vary in the range 0.1 - 0.3% . although not used in the nijmegen analysis , the nijmegen energy - dependent fit agrees with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite at 2425  kev within 0.4% for the angles of our interest . the systematic uncertainty in the absolute p - d cross sections is estimated to be @xmath80 ;",

    "the assumed p - p cross sections and the p - d cross sections derived from them are given in table  [ tab : abs_sig ] .      analyzing powers were determined from the particle yields measured for each spin state .",
    "the yields for each spin state were corrected for background and dead time , and were normalized by the number of incident particles .",
