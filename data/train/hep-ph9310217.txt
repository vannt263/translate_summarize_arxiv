    "the standard model has been tested to a remarkable accuracy at lep but there is still very little to be said about its electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector apart from a lower limit on the higgs boson mass , @xmath4 gev @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , the existence of a higgs boson by itself makes it difficult to understand the fine - tuning that protects its mass to be as large as the planck mass .",
    "there are two possible ways to avoid this so - called hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "one could either have a supersymmetric theory , in which quantum corrections to the higgs mass are only logarithmic instead of quadratic , or one could have a strongly interacting underlying theory which has the ewsb sector as its low - energy effective theory . in spite of some new indirect evidence in favor of supersymmetric models @xcite , here we will concentrate on the second approach , which has rich experimental consequences at the tev scale that could be tested at the ssc and lhc .",
    "the presence of this strongly interacting sector would manifest itself primarily in the scattering of the longitudinal components of the weak gauge bosons @xmath5 , which at high energies behave as the pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons originating from the global symmetry breaking occurring in the ewsb sector , @xmath6 .",
    "the residual @xmath7 symmetry is responsible for keeping @xmath8 at tree level .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 s and @xmath10 s behave as techni - pions of this underlying strong dynamics and we can describe their interactions by using chiral lagrangian techniques . if this scenario is correct , it is very plausible that resonances would also play a role in describing physical processes .",
    "in fact , amplitudes derived solely from the pion sector of a chiral lagrangian grow with energy and violate unitarity rather quickly ; the presence of resonances tend to unitarize these amplitudes . at this point",
    ", there are two types of resonances that could appear : scalar and vector resonances .",
    "the usual higgs sector is an example of the former choice ; however , in qcd we know that vector resonances are more important in restoring unitarity , _",
    "i.e. _ , in saturating scattering amplitudes .",
    "therefore , we should keep an open mind with respect to what type of resonance would show up in @xmath11 scattering .",
    "both types of resonances can be nicely described in terms of chiral lagrangians . a detailed study of consequences of chiral lagrangians with either scalar or vector resonances ( and of other models as well ) in @xmath11 scattering",

    "we immediately see that the model with a vector resonance is characterized by an _ absence _ of the signal .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that , in contrast to the scalar resonance case , there is no @xmath1-channel resonance contribution to the rescattering process @xmath124 in the vector resonance model .",
    "a few words are now in order with respect to our calculation in the vector model . at the energies we are considering , for @xmath112 close to its qcd value , the contribution from eq .",
    "( [ eq : extra ] ) is very small , the end result being almost identical to taking @xmath125 .",
    "there is a priori no dynamical reason for not having larger values of @xmath112 ( @xmath112 is proportional to the techniquark magnetic moment ) , which typically results in an enhancement of the cross section at high energies .    also of interest",
    "is the result of our calculation to qcd . in that case",
    ", we find a cross section for @xmath126 that presents the features of interference between the two contributions and is considerably below the experimental values .",
    "however , when the two contributions are taken separately either the unitarized amplitude ( @xmath127 ) or the non - unitarized+vector exchange amplitude ( @xmath128 ) would fairly reproduce the qcd data .",
    "we do nt expect this crude model to describe the qcd data accurately since we have not include the effects of other resonances like the @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that eq.([eq : result ] ) is an _ assumption _ that , although found correct in the scalar model , may not be valid in the vector model .",
    "it actually introduces spurious @xmath131 and @xmath132channel poles in addition to the physical ones given by the second term in eq.(34 ) .",
    "in fact , it was recently shown by pennington and morgan @xcite that only for models in which the amplitude for @xmath133 is independent of the initial pions momenta does eq.([eq : result ] ) holds .",
    "this is indeed the case for the non - resonance and scalar models .",
    "they have also shown by means of an explicit calculation that , in a model that includes both scalar and vector resonances , eq.([eq : result ] ) does not reproduce the correct threshold behavior for @xmath134 . however , the _ numerical _ difference that exists between the ansatz of eq.([eq : result ] ) and the exact result in different kinematic regimes is still unknown .",
    "for instance , dobado and pelez @xcite used a pad unitarized amplitude for @xmath133 , which effectively generates a @xmath135-meson , to compute @xmath134 via eq.([eq : result ] ) and found a good agreement with their exact unitarized result ( and with data     vertex , which can upset the good agreement between their results and experimental data . ] ) .",
    "a more complete calculation would involve computing the contribution of the vector resonances in loops , that is , a complete one - loop analysis of this process in the context of the hidden symmetry model @xcite .",
    "since this model is supposed to be a good description of qcd , we do nt expect any major differences from this more thorough approach .",
    "there has been recent interest in the possibility of producing a high energy photon - photon collider by back - scattering a high intensity laser beam off a high energy electron beam .",
    "most of the scattered photons have their direction close to the original electron beam and carry a large fraction of the initial electron energy .",
    "the probability of finding a photon carrying an energy fraction @xmath136 of the initial electron is given by @xcite : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is defined in terms of the electron mass @xmath139 , the electron initial energy @xmath140 and the energy of the photon in the laser beam @xmath141 : @xmath142 and @xmath143 \\ln ( 1+\\xi ) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } + \\frac{8}{\\xi } - \\frac{1}{2 ( 1+\\xi)^2 }   \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 is the maximum energy fraction carried by the scattered photon .",

    "in this example we ll neglect @xmath157 pair production that may occur for @xmath158 .",
    "we concentrate in the region @xmath159 gev , where the equivalence theorem as well as the use of massless phase space become good approximations . in this figure",
    "we compare the results of the vector resonance model with different parameters with a @xmath154 tev higgs model , since for a smaller higgs mass the signal for the scalar model is much larger than for the vector model .",
    "the resonant shape of the curves in this figure is an artifact arising from the convolution of a growing point cross section with a photon luminosity function that falls rapidly near the kinematical limit @xmath160 gev .",
    "the cross section arising from the model with a vector resonance is generally small compared to a model with a scalar resonance of mass @xmath161 gev , where a pole structure is the dominant feature of the signal .",
    "however , the absence of a clear resonance structure would not rule out the scalar model since it may be possible that the scalar mass is above the @xmath154 tev scale , in which case the cross section is small ( @xmath162 ) in both models .",
    "the situation becomes even worse when backgrounds are taken into account @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that the irreducible background from the production of transversally polarized @xmath163 pairs is very large @xcite , reducing the possibilities of finding even a scalar resonance with mass above @xmath164 gev . as techniques for the determination of the polarization of gauge bosons",
    "are improved and high luminosity ( @xmath165 ) @xmath17 colliders become available @xcite it may eventually be possible to extract some information on the symmetry breaking sector from the process @xmath166 .",
    "the vector resonance model could in principle be better tested at an @xmath167 facility because of the @xmath168channel contribution to the subprocess @xmath169 that exists in addition to the @xmath170 boson contribution .",
