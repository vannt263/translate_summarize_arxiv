    "studies of heavy quarkonium production in high energy collisions provide important information on both perturbative and nonperturbative qcd . in the conventional picture ,",
    "the heavy quarkonium production is described in the color - singlet model ( csm)@xcite . in this model",
    ", it is assumed that the heavy quark pair must be produced in a color - singlet state at short distance with the same angular - momentum quantum number as the charmonium which is eventually observed . however , with the recent tevatron data on high @xmath5 @xmath0 production , this color - singlet picture for heavy quarkonium production has become questionable",
    ", the observed cross section is larger than the theoretical prediction of the color - singlet model by a factor of about @xmath6@xcite .",
    "this is called the @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) surplus problem . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the naive color - singlet model has been supplanted by the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism @xcite , which allows the infrared safe calculation of inclusive charmonium production and decay rates . in this approach , the production process is factorized into short and long distance parts , while the latter is associated with the nonperturbative matrix elements of four - fermion operators .",
    "so , for heavy quarkonium production , the quark - antiquark pair does not need to be in the color - singlet state in the short distance production stage , which is at the scale of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the heavy quark mass ) . at this stage ,",
    "the color configuration other than the singlet is allowed for the heavy quark pair , such as color - octet . the later situation for heavy quarkonium production",
    "is called the color - octet mechanism . in this production mechanism",
    ", heavy quark - antiquark pair is produced at short distances in a color - octet state , and then hadronizes into a final state quarkonium ( physical state ) nonperturbatively .",
    "the color - octet terms in the gluon fragmentation to @xmath0(@xmath7 ) have been considered to explain the @xmath0(@xmath7 ) surplus problems discovered by cdf @xcite .",
    "taking the nonperturbative @xmath10 and @xmath11 as input parameters , the cdf surplus problem for @xmath0 and @xmath7 can be explained as the contributions of color - octet terms due to gluon fragmentation .",
    "apart from the nrqcd factorization approach ( nrqcd fa ) mentioned above , there are also other approaches for describing heavy quarkonium production in literature advocated in these years , such as the color evaporation model@xcite , and the model of heavy quarkonium production with interactions with comoving fields@xcite .",
    "even though the color - octet mechanism has achieved some successes in describing the production and decay of heavy quarkonia , more tests of this mechanism are still needed .",
    "recently , the photoproduction data from hera @xcite put a question about the color - octet predictions for the inelastic photoproduction of @xmath0@xcite ( possible solutions for this problem have been suggested in@xcite ) .",
    "most recently , the cdf collaboration have reported their preliminary measurements on the polarizations of the promptly produced charmonium and bottomonium states@xcite , which appear not to support the color - octet predictions that the directly produced @xmath12-wave quarkonia have transverse polarization at large @xmath5@xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions shows that the predictions of nrqcd color - octet mechanism on the polarizations of heavy quarkonium productions may be questionable .",
    "however , the final conclusion about this problem can be achieved only if the polarizations of charmonium production in other processes are also measured and compared with theoretical predictions . in this paper",
    ", we will study the polarization of @xmath0 production in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes at hera collider .",
    "the relevant photoproduction processes have been studied in @xcite , and the leading order color - octet @xmath0 production and polarization in dis have been studied in @xcite ( from @xmath13 virtual photon subprocesses ) .",
    "these processes contribute to @xmath0 production in the forward direction . in this paper",
    ", we will complete these studies by calculating the @xmath0 production in dis from the nlo color - octet processes , i.e. , from the virtual photon @xmath14 subprocesses . with these calculations , we can study the @xmath1 distributions of @xmath0 production and polarization in dis processes at hera , which will compensate the previous studies in the photoproduction process . moreover , since the photon virtuality @xmath4 can be large , electroproduction is a better process from which to test the color - octet mechanism and to extract the nrqcd long distance matrix elements than photoproduction .",
    "the latter process lacks any large energy scale other than the charm quark mass , and consequently , higher order perturbative corrections to leading order calculations are expected to be large .",
    "in addition , nonperturbative effects , such as higher twist corrections to the parton model , are less effectively suppressed in photoproduction than in electroproduction at large @xmath4 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will give the polarized cross section formula for the inelastic @xmath0 production at the electron - proton collider .",
    "here , we adopt the weizscker - williams approximation to calculate the electroproduction cross section with the photoproduction cross section .",
    "the numerical results are given in sec .",
    "we will display the polarized cross sections for both the photon - proton collisions and electron - proton collisions . in sec .",
    "iv , we give the conclusions .",
    "the polar angular distribution in @xmath15 decay is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the angle between the lepton three - momentum in the @xmath0 rest frame and the polarization axis .",
    "@xmath3 is the polar angle asymmetry parameter , @xmath18 where @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the helicity of the produced @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath21 means @xmath0 is longitudinally polarized , and @xmath22 transversely polarized .    in the born approximation ,",
    "the electroproduction cross section @xmath23 is related to the @xmath24 cross section by @xmath25 here @xmath26 are the flux factors of the transversely and longitudinally polarized virtual photons respectively , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fraction of the lepton s energy lost in the proton rest frame . in the typical kinematic region of hera experiments , the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath30 is negligible .",
    "so , in practice , we can simplify the cross section formula of eq.([epc ] ) as @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the cross sections for the transversely and longitudinally polarized virtual photons respectively .",
    "there are two types of contributions to the @xmath34 cross section : the direct photoproduction and the resolved photon production .",
    "the latter contribution is through the partonic content of @xmath35 in the reactions .",
    "the cross section formulas ( polarized and unpolarized ) for the relevant partonic processes of these resolved photon production processes can be found in @xcite . in the following",
    "we will calculate the polarized cross sections for the direct virtual photon ( @xmath36 ) processes , which include the following partonic channels , @xmath37+g;\\\\ \\gamma^*+q/\\bar q\\rightarrow ( c\\bar c)[{}^3s_1^{(8)},{}^1s_0^{(8)},{}^3p_j^{(8 ) } ] + q/\\bar q.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this paper , we calculate the above @xmath14 subprocess contributions to production of @xmath0 , and present the @xmath1 distribution of the production rate . for this purpose ,",
    "in the following we will not consider the @xmath13 subprocess contributions , because these contributions only take place in the forward region .",
    "to calculate these virtual photon subprocesses , we employ the helicity amplitude method .",
    "following @xcite , we choose the polarization vectors for the incident and the outgoing gluons as @xmath38,\\\\ \\label{e3 } \\not\\ ! e_3^{(\\pm)}=n_e[\\not\\ ! p_3\\not\\ !",

    "the normalization factor @xmath44 is @xmath45 where m is the mass of @xmath0 .",
    "the mandelstam invariants @xmath46 are defined as @xmath47 and they satisfy the relation @xmath48 for the transversely polarized photons , we have the following projection operator , @xmath49 and for the longitudinally polarized photons , we have @xmath50    providing with the above defined polarized vectors and polarized projection tensors , we can calculate the amplitude squared for the partonic processes with the definite helicities of the incident and the outgoing partons .",
    "after summing up the helicities and colors , we express the amplitude squared as the following form @xmath51 \\langle { \\cal o}_n^{j/\\psi}\\rangle , \\ ] ] where the short - distance coefficients @xmath52 can be written as @xmath53&=&a_{ij}[n][\\epsilon^*(\\lambda)\\cdot \\epsilon(\\lambda ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + b_{ij}[n][\\epsilon^*(\\lambda)\\cdot p_1\\epsilon(\\lambda)\\cdot p_1 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & +          c_{ij}[n][\\epsilon^*(\\lambda)\\cdot p_2\\epsilon(\\lambda)\\cdot p_2 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & +          d_{ij}[n][\\epsilon^*(\\lambda)\\cdot p_1][\\epsilon(\\lambda)\\cdot p_2].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath54 denote the intermediated states , which include @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath56 functions for different partonic processes are listed in the appendix .    for convenience , we consider the @xmath0 polarization in the _ target _ frame . in this frame , the covariant expression for the polarization vector of @xmath0 with helicity @xmath21 reads@xcite @xmath57 with this equation and eqs.([ms]-[fs ] ) , we can calculate the polarized cross sections , and obtain the polar angle asymmetry parameter @xmath3 in eq.([alp ] ) .",
    "we have checked that our cross section formulas can reproduce the photoproduction cross section formulas @xcite at @xmath58 , and that the unpolarized cross section for the color - singlet process is consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "the production rate of @xmath0 and its polarization parameter @xmath3 depend on the sizes of the nrqcd long distance matrix elements , including the color - singlet matrix elements and the color - octet matrix elements .",
    "we choose these matrix elements as @xmath59 the color - singlet matrix element @xmath60 can be related to the @xmath61 wave function at the origin , and can be taken from the leptonic decay width of @xmath0 .",
    "the last equation comes from the approximation of heavy quark spin symmetry of nrqcd .",
    "the value of the color - octet matrix element @xmath62 is taken from a fit to the large @xmath5 @xmath0 production at the tevatron@xcite .",
    "this matrix element is not important to @xmath0 photoproduction both for the production rate and the polarization parameter @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the other two color - octet matrix elements , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are known to be very important in the inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction @xcite . however , their values are not well determined from the present experimental data on @xmath0 productions . here",
    ", we just follow ref .  @xcite and take their values tentatively as listed above ( which are also consistent with the naive nrqcd velocity scaling rules ) to see what are their contributions to the cross section and the polarization @xmath3 of @xmath0 production in dis at hera . for the numerical evaluation",
    ", we choose @xmath65 , and set the renormalization scale and the factorization scale both equal to @xmath66 . for the parton distribution functions of the proton",
    ", we use the glck - reya - vogt ( grv ) lo parameterization@xcite .",
    "we first display the @xmath1 distribution of the inelastic @xmath0 production rate in dis region at hera , comparing the theoretical predictions with the zeus data@xcite .",
    "the kinematic region is @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in fig .  1",
    ", the dotted line is for the color - singlet contribution , the dotted - dashed line for the direct virtual photon contributions from the color - octet processes , and the dashed line for the resolved virtual photon contributions from the color - octet processes . for the above two components of the color - octet contributions , we choose the color - octet matrix elements of @xmath69 and @xmath64 as @xmath70 and the solid lines correspond to the nrqcd fa predictions ( including the color - singlet contributions and the color - octet contributions ) for the two choices of the color - octet matrix elements : ( i ) for the lower solid line , @xmath71 ( ii ) for the upper solid line , @xmath72 > from this figure",
    ", we can also see that the rapid increase of the color - octet predictions at large @xmath1 is not supported by the experimental data .",
    "this is similar to the case of the @xmath0 photoproduction ( @xmath58 ) , and may indicate that at large @xmath1 the calculations of the color - octet processes are also unreliable due to higher order @xmath73 contributions@xcite . on the other hand , we find that the color - singlet contributions are consistent with the experimental data in the major region of @xmath1 . however , as indicated by the color - singlet photoproduction processes calculations@xcite , the color - singlet cross sections have large theoretical uncertainties due to input parameters such as the normalization and factorization scales and the charm quark mass . in this context , it is difficult to immediately conclude that the experimental data are just saturated by the color - singlet contributions and there is no more space for the color - octet contributions .",
    "especially , in the lower @xmath1 region the experimental data lie above the color - singlet contributions , where the dominant contributions come from the color - octet channels in the resolved photon processes .",
    "( the color - singlet contributions in the resolved photon processes is much smaller than the color - octet contributions , and is not presented in fig .  1 ) .",
    "this may be viewed as a hint of the need of the color - octet contributions in describing the experimental data on @xmath0 photoproduction in the lower @xmath1 region .",
    "we now turn to study the angular distributions of @xmath0 productions .",
    "since the decay angular distribution parameter @xmath3 is normalized , its dependence on parameters that affect the absolute normalization of the production cross sections , such as the charm quark mass , the strong coupling constant , the renormalization and factorization scales and the parton distribution functions , cancels to a large extent and does not constitute a significant uncertainty .",
    "that is to say , in some sense , the polarization parameter as a tool for testing production mechanism is more efficient than the absolute production rate . in fig .",
    "2 , we first display the polarization parameter @xmath3 as a function of @xmath1 for the @xmath34 processes , where the c.m .",
    "energy of @xmath34 system is set to be @xmath74 . here in this figure",
    "we do not include the resolved photon processes contributions .",
    "the solid lines are for the csm predictions , and the other two lines are for the nrqcd fa ( including both the color - singlet and color - octet contributions ) corresponding to the two choices of the color - octet matrix elements : the dashed lines for the choice of eq .",
    "( [ ma1 ] ) and the dotted - dashed lines for the choice of eq .",
    "( [ ma2 ] ) . in order to see the @xmath4 dependence of the polarization , we choose four typical values for @xmath4 : @xmath75 . from these plots",
    ", we can see that the polarization parameter @xmath3 in large @xmath1 region change from positive values to negative values as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this means that in large @xmath1 region @xmath0 production will be dominantly longitudinally polarized at high @xmath4 .",
    "especially , the polarization parameter @xmath3 for csm predictions are more sensitive to @xmath4 than those for the nrqcd fa predictions . at high @xmath4 , e.g. , @xmath76 , the difference on @xmath3 between csm and nrqcd fa can be distinguished for large @xmath1 @xmath0 production ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "in this case , the csm prediction approaches to @xmath77 while the nrqcd fa predictions are both above @xmath78 for the two choices of the color - octet matrix elements ( eqs .",
    "( [ ma1 ] ) and ( [ ma2 ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , we note that if @xmath79 channel dominates @xmath0 production the polarization parameter @xmath3 will be close to zero because in this case the produced @xmath0 are unpolarized , which can also be seen from fig .",
    "2 .    in fig .  3",
    ", we show the parameter @xmath3 as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath80 collisions at hera ( including the resolved photon contributions ) . as in fig .  2 , we choose two typical regions for @xmath4 : ( a ) @xmath67 , and ( b ) @xmath81 .",
    "from this figure , we also find that the @xmath0 polarization changes with @xmath4 .",
    "especially , at higher @xmath4 , the difference on @xmath3 between csm predictions and nrqcd fa predictions become more distinctive . in the two regions of lower and larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the polarization parameter @xmath3 have different features . in the lower @xmath1 region ,",
    "the nrqcd fa predicts @xmath0 being transversely polarized for the octet matrix elements choice of eq .",
    "( [ ma2 ] ) , while the csm predicts @xmath0 to be only slightly polarized ( almost compatible with unpolarized ) .",
    "we note that in this region , the dominant contributions in the nrqcd fa come from the color - octet resolved photon processes ( see fig .  1 ) , which have the similar properties as they have for @xmath0 hadroproduction , contributing to @xmath0 transverse polarization@xcite . in fig .  3 , for larger @xmath1 ,",
    "on the other hand we find that the csm predicts @xmath0 being more polarized , which is however longitudinal .",
    "the nrqcd fa predicts @xmath0 less polarized ( also longitudinally if @xmath82 dominates ) .",
    "again , we note if @xmath0 production is dominated by @xmath79 channel , it will be unpolarized as that for @xmath34 processes .    in the above",
    "analyzes , we present the nrqcd fa predictions of the polarization parameters @xmath3 by using the color - octet matrix elements as in eqs .",
    "( [ ma1 ] ) and ( [ ma2 ] ) . however , there are other sets of parameterizations for the two color - octet matrix elements @xmath69 and @xmath64 in the literature@xcite . with these rather small values for the two color - octet matrix elements @xcite",
    ", the above predictions of @xmath3 in the nrqcd fa will be changed .",
    "for example , if we follow the values obtained in @xcite , the two equations of ( [ ma1 ] ) and ( [ ma2 ] ) will be changed to @xmath83 for case ( i ) , and @xmath84 for case ( ii ) .",
    "if we use the above values for the matrix elements of @xmath69 and @xmath64 , the difference of the polarization parameter @xmath3 between the csm and the nrqcd fa will be reduced , because with these rather small values for the color - octet matrix elements the color - octet contributions to @xmath0 production are much less important than those with parameterizations of eqs .",
    "( [ ma1 ] ) and ( [ ma2 ] ) .",
    "this influence is presented in fig .  4 , where we show the same plot as in fig .  3 but with the new parameterizations of the color - octet matrix elements as in eqs .",
    "( [ ma1p ] ) and ( [ ma2p ] ) . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the difference between these two approaches is reduced , though in some regions there are still some differences .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated @xmath0 production and polarization in dis at @xmath80 colliders in the energy region relevant to hera . compensating for the previous color - octet leading order calculations , we have calculated the cross sections for the @xmath34 @xmath14 subprocesses which are needed for theoretical evaluations of the @xmath1 distributions of the production rate and the polarization parameter @xmath3 . for the inclusive production distributions , we find that the color - singlet contributions are consistent with the experimental data in the major region of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . only in the low @xmath1 regions ,",
    "there are some hints of the need of the color - octet contributions to describe the experimental data .    for the polarization of @xmath0 in dis processes",
    ", we find the parameter @xmath3 changes with @xmath4 .",
    "especially , at higher @xmath4 , difference on @xmath3 between the csm and the nrqcd fa become more distinctive . in the two regions of lower and larger @xmath1 , the polarization parameter @xmath3 have different features . in the lower @xmath1 region , the nrqcd fa predicts @xmath0 being transversely polarized if the @xmath82 channel dominates , while the csm @xmath0 being almost unpolarized . on the other hand , in the larger @xmath1 region",
    "the csm predicts @xmath0 being longitudinally polarized , while the nrqcd fa predicts @xmath0 being unpolarized if the @xmath79 channel dominates . in conclusion",
    ", the polarization of @xmath0 in dis processes at @xmath80 colliders will give another independent test for the production mechanism and help to clarify the present problem concerning the disagreement of the theoretical predictions with the experimental data on polarization in hadroproduction processes at the tevatron .",
