    "spatial confinement of particle s motion to low - dimensional space has an enormous influence on the quantum - mechanical properties of the particle .",
    "of particular interests are systems in which a particle s motion is constrained to a thin curved layer by a strong confining force . due to the confinement ,",
    "excitation energies of the particle in a direction normal to the layer are significantly higher than those in a direction tangential to it ; as a result , one can define an effective hamiltonian that involves an anisotropic effective mass and a curvature - induced scalar potential @xcite .",
    "this implies that the behavior of quantum particles that are confined to a thin curved layer is different from that of quantum particles on a flat plane , even in the absence of external field ( except for the confining force ) .",
    "the effect of curvature was first suggested by jensen and koppe @xcite , and this was followed by subsequent studies that were conducted out of mathematical curiosity @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the effect of curvature has been reconsidered from the viewpoints of condensed matter physics @xcite , owing to technological progress that has enabled the fabrication of nanostructures with curved geometries @xcite .",
    "in addition to surface curvature , geometric _ torsion _ is another important parameter relevant to quantum mechanics in low - dimensional nanostructures .",
    "a torsion effect is manifested in quantum transport in a thin twisted nanowire with a finite cross section .",
    "when a quantum particle moves along a long thin twisted wire , it exhibits a quantum phase shift whose magnitude is proportional to the integral of the torsion along the wire @xcite .",
    "this torsion - induced phase shift is attributed to an effective vector potential that appears in the effective hamiltonian defined for the movement of a particle in a twisted nanowire .",
    "the mathematical mechanism for the occurrence of the effective vector potential was demonstrated by takagi and tanzawa @xcite , and independently by magarill and @xmath0ntin @xcite .",
    "their results imply various intriguing phenomena purely originating from geometric torsion .",
    "for instance , the torsion - induced phase shift may give rise to a novel class of persistent current flow along a closed loop of a twisted wire ; it is novel in the sense that no magnetic field need to penetrate inside the loop , which is in contrast with the ordinary persistent current @xcite observed in a non - twist quantum loop .",
    "however , optimal physical conditions as well as geometric parameters in order to measure those phenomena have been overlooked so far .",
    "quantitative discussions as to what degree of torsion is necessary to make the phenomena be measurable in real experiments are important from both fundamental and practical viewpoints .    in this article , we have investigated the quantum state of electrons in a closed loop of a twisted wire , i.e. a twisted quantum ring .",
    "the wire consists of twisted atomic configuration , and its centroidal axis is embedded in a flat plane ; these assumptions mean that the torsion in our system is defined with respect to a twisting crystalline reference frame .",
    "we have revealed that the magnitude of the torsion - induced persistent current @xmath1 comes within a range of existing measurement techniques under appropriate conditions ; this indicates the significance of torsion - induced quantum phase shift in the study of actual nanostructures , besides its theoretical interest .",
    "it should be emphasized that the persistent current @xmath1 we have considered is free from a magnetic field penetrating through the ring , and thus differs inherently from the counterpart observed in untwisted rings .",
    "in this section , we derive an explicit form of the effective vector potential in line with the discussions presented in reference @xcite .",

    "we assume that @xmath5 is embedded in a flat plane so that @xmath5 _ itself _ has no torsion ; therefore , the torsion of the present system is a consequence of the twisted atomic structure around the axis @xmath5 of the conducting cylinder .    a point on @xmath5",
    "is given by the position vector @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , a point in the vicinity of @xmath5 is represented by @xmath8 where the set ( @xmath9 ) with @xmath10 and @xmath11 forms a right - handed orthogonal triad ; we use the notation @xmath12 throughout the paper . here , the unit vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 span the cross section normal to @xmath5 , and they rotate along @xmath5 with the same rotation rate as that of the atomic configuration . to be precise , the @xmath4-dependences of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are chosen such that the torsion @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 conforms to that of the twisted atomic structure . using continuum approximation , we obtain the schrdinger equation for the twisted quantum cylinder as @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the effective mass of the electron , and @xmath21 with @xmath22 is a strong confining potential that confines the electron s motion to the vicinity of @xmath5 .",
