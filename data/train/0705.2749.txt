    "the schramm - loewner evolutions ( sles ) are random growth processes that generate conformally invariant curves in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "sles yield probability measures on the continuum limit of non - crossing interfaces in 2d statistical lattice models at criticality with conformal invariance .",
    "sles has been proved successful to a more complete , and in some case mathematically rigorous , description of fractal curves in critical percolation @xcite , loop erased walk @xcite , level lines of height models @xcite and domain boundaries at phase transitions ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . the sles consider directly the geometrical characterization of non - local objects in 2d critical systems and complement the powerful tools provided by the conformal field theories ( cfts ) techniques .",
    "on the other hand , cfts focus on correlation functions of local operators which are the scaling limit of lattice variables .",
    "a first family of cfts , the minimal cfts , calculates these correlation functions by studying the infinite constraints imposed by the conformal invariance in 2d systems .",
    "the hilbert space of these theories is constructed from the highest weight representations of the virasoro algebra formed by the generators of the conformal symmetry .",
    "the relation between sles and cfts has been worked out in @xcite . in this respect , an important role",
    "is played by the boundary conditions changing operators ( b.c.c . ) which generate the boundary conditions from which the curve grows @xcite .",
    "the key property of these operators is to satisfy particular relations under the action of the conformal symmetry generators which lead to second order differential equations for their correlation functions .",
    "the link between the sles and cfts is derived by comparing these second order equations to the fokker - plank equations coming from the brownian motion driving the sle .",
    "the sles / cfts connection is well established in the case of minimal cfts , which have a central charge @xmath11 . however , many critical models in condensed matter and statistical physics posses , in addition to the conformal invariance , symmetries in some internal degree of freedom , such as the @xmath12 spin - rotational symmetry in critical quantum spin chains @xcite or the @xmath13 symmetry in spin lattice models @xcite . in the continuum limit , these additional symmetries are enhanced by the presence of chiral currents which form , together with the energy - momentum tensor , more structured algebras which present the virasoro one as a sub - algebra .",
    "the space of local fields occurring in a cft with additional symmetry , the non - minimal cft , corresponds to the representations of the associated chiral algebra .",
    "these theories have in general a central charge @xmath4 .",
    "the connection between sles and non - minimal cfts has been first addressed in @xcite , where the relation between stochastic evolutions and superconformal field theory was investigated .",
    "more recently , the connection between sle and wess - zumino - witten models , i.e. cfts with additional lie - group symmetries , has been studied by very different approaches @xcite . in particular , it has been shown in @xcite that a consistent sle approach is possible provided that an additional stochastic motion in the internal symmetry group space in introduced . for an @xmath12 symmetry ,",
    "for instance , the sle describes a process which carries a fluctuating additional spin @xmath14 degree of freedom .    inspired by these results , we discuss in this paper a possible sle approach to cfts with additional @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "the conserved currents associated to the extra symmetry , called parafermions , have fractional spin .",
    "we consider the first of such parafermionic theories with central charge @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 models coincide with some particular minimal cft where the domain wall boundary conditions and the associated b.c.c .",
    "operator are known .",
    "we exploit these pieces of information to identify the possible b.c.c .",
    "operators for general @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "we show that , under the action of the parafermionic conserved currents , these operators satisfy algebraic relations similar to the ones found in the case of minimal models . from these cft predictions and in analogy with the approach proposed in @xcite",
    ", we introduce an additional stochastic motion driven by the action of the parafermionic currents .",
    "the strong motivation to study these theories lies on the fact that they describe the continuum limit of critical lattice models , the @xmath18-states generalization of the ising model which reduce to the ising and three state potts model for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this allows for the identification of the sle interfaces on the lattice and opens the possibility of a direct numerical verification .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "section [ slelie ] provides the extension to cfts with extra lie symmetries . in section [ sle / para ] , after an introduction to the operator content of the parafermionic theories , we define a stochastic motion in the @xmath13 internal space .",
    "further , by studying the parafermionic algebra representations , we derive some algebraic relations related to the b.c.c . operators . in section [ lattice model ]",

    "it was understood how to associate cft states with the growing curves of the loewner process . to reveal the sle / cft connection ,",
    "the first step is to define stochastic process such that conditioned correlation function are martingales for this process .",
    "the main idea is to arrange the statistical sum by first summing over all the configurations @xmath38 presenting a trace @xmath21 of the interface with fixed shape and capacity @xmath39 and then summing aver all the possible shapes of the trace .",

    "the correlator @xmath45 does not depend on the choice of @xmath27 : the stochastic mean of the correlator @xmath43 is thus time independent and it is a martingale .",
