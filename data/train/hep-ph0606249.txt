    "the factored representation on @xmath14 thus provides a simple and compact representation of @xmath0-@xmath1 ffs over a broad energy range and permits extrapolation to small energy scales .",
    "reduction of scaling violations to near - linear variations of beta parameters @xmath87 may provide more differential access to the energy dependence of parton fragmentation .",
    "the beta distribution model suggests that fragmentation of light partons can be viewed at larger energy scales as an entropy - maximizing equilibration process . in this analysis",
    "the energy dependence of fragmentation has been extrapolated down to a kinematic region not accessed by conventional methods .",
    "such low-@xmath7 extrapolation provides a phenomenological context for minijet - related two - particle correlations in p - p and a - a collisions at rhic , forming a basis for theoretical treatments of in - medium dissipation of low-@xmath7 partons and the subsequent hadronization process in heavy ion collisions .",
