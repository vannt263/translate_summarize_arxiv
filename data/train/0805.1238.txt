    "the probability distribution function ( hereafter pdf ; some authors prefer to call this the probability density function ) specifies the probability that a randomly placed cell of specified size and shape contains a certain specified density .",
    "as gravitational instability alters the spatial distribution of dark matter , the pdf of the dark matter density field evolves . broadly speaking ,",
    "there are two approaches to modeling this evolution : one is to study the evolution of the lower order moments of the pdf , and the other studies the shape of the pdf in its entirety .",
    "typically , the first approach attempts to describe the evolution exactly , using methods derived from perturbation theory , but then the pdf is often computed approximately , upon truncating higher order terms in the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the second uses simple approximations to the exact evolution to derive tractable results ; in almost all cases , these specify local transformations which describe how quantities in the initial field determine the evolved density .",
    "the best studied of these approximations are the spherical evolution model @xcite , or the zeldovich approximation @xcite and its extension to the ellipsoidal collapse model @xcite . in principle , there is a limit to how well approaches based on deterministic transformations can fare @xcite , but , provided one restricts attention to large enough scales , this is a small effect @xcite .",
    "the associated pdf in redshift , rather than real space , is less well - studied . in this case too , the pdf is described in terms of its moments @xcite , using the spherical model @xcite , or using the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite describe a calculation of the pdf based on second order perturbation theory .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to present a calculation of the pdf which is based on the ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "our work is motivated by the fact that the spherical collapse model is inconsistent with a linear theory analysis of the second moment of the pdf by @xcite . whereas kaiser showed that the ratio of the redshift space variance to that in real space should be @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 with @xmath2 the linear theory growth factor and @xmath3 the expansion factor ) , a finding which was confirmed by @xcite using a very different approach",
    ", the spherical model predicts that this factor is @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "an analysis based on the zeldovich approximation does yield kaiser s factor @xcite , providing yet another , very different derivation of this factor , so it is the spherical model which is in error .",
    "for this reason , our analysis of the redshift space pdf is based on the ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "although this model has a long history @xcite , we use it in the form given by @xcite .",
    "they showed how to write this model so that , to lowest order it reduces to the zeldovich approximation .",
    "it is this formulation we use , so the approach we outline below is _ guaranteed _ to correctly reproduce the kaiser factor . this ellipsoidal collapse model ( and its associated tidal shear effects )",
    "has previously been used to motivate more accurate models of the abundance of virialized dark matter halos @xcite ; it also provides a framework for studying how the morphology , rather than just the density , of the large scale enviroment affect structure formation @xcite .",
    "we describe our model in section  [ pdfz ] , and compare its predictions with measurements in a numerical simulation in section  [ section : xpx ] .",
    "section  [ reconst ] describes a method for reconstructing the shape of the initial real - space pdf from the evolved redshift space pdf . a final section summarizes .",
    "details of some of our methods are provided in two appendices .",
    "in what follows , the variance of the initial density fluctuation field when smoothed on scale @xmath5 plays an important role .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the power spectrum of the initial field , extrapolated using linear theory to the present time , @xmath8 is the fourier transform of the smoothing window function , and @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , we use @xmath10 to denote the linear growth factor , and @xmath11 .",
    "the nonlinear overdensity of a region of volume @xmath12 containing mass @xmath13 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean density .",
    "if the evolved eulerian region is a sphere , then the evolved overdensity in real space is well - approximated by @xmath16 ( see appendix  [ section : ec ] ) . here",
    "@xmath17 is the critical value of spherical collapse model and its exact value depends weakly on the background cosmology . in a @xmath18cdm cosmology @xmath19 , while in an einstein - de sitter model @xmath20 . )",
    "the @xmath21s are the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor , extrapolated using linear theory to the present time , and @xmath22 is the linear theory overdensity .",
    "this approximation has considerable intuitive appeal : the factor in the product sign is the zeldovich approximation to the evolution , and the factor in front is the ratio of the evolution of a sphere in the zeldovich approximation to that in the spherical collapse model .",
    "the expression actually uses a simple approximation to the evolution of the density in the spherical model ; in principle , one could use the exact evolution instead .",
    "the redshift space overdensity @xmath23 is related to the real space one by the mapping from real space to redshift space @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the redshift space coordinate , @xmath26 is the real space coordinate , @xmath27 is the peculiar velocity at @xmath26 , @xmath28 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath29 is the line - of - sight direction unit vector .",
    "then , @xmath30 where we assume the line - of - sight direction is along the third axis .",
    "the velocity of the ellipsoidal region along its principal axis can be computed using equation  , @xmath31/3\\right\\}}{r_k^i(1-\\lambda_k)-a^i_h\\left[1-\\delta_l/3-(1-\\delta_l/\\delta_c)^{\\delta_c/3}\\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath10 is the linear growth factor .",
    "@xmath33 is the initial axis length and it is related to @xmath34 by equation  . for a randomly oriented ellipsoid we label the euler angle components @xmath35 for rotation from the line - of - sight coordinate to the coordinate of the principal axes of the ellipsoid . as a result",

    "our redshift space perturbation theory calculation makes use of the same assumptions as in real space : there is a local mapping from the eigenvalues @xmath39 of the deformation tensor to the non - linear overdensity @xmath23 ; and the smoothing scale associated with @xmath23 in the initial field is the one containing the same mass with the correct shape .",
    "the most important difference in redshift space calculation is that the mapping from @xmath39 to @xmath23 is no longer deterministic : the orientation of the ellipsoid with respect to the line of sight introduces stochasticity which must be integrated over . as a result",

    "\\label{eqn : ellvar}\\ ] ] here @xmath46 denotes the initial size of the @xmath47th principal axis , and @xmath48 @xcite . as a result",
    ", it is useful to rewrite equation  ( [ eqn : ecpdf ] ) as @xmath49.\\ ] ]            as happens for the real space calculation @xcite , this estimate of the redshift space pdf is not correctly normalized : @xmath50 ( on the other hand , the integral of equation  [ eqn : ecpdf ] over all @xmath23 does equal unity . )",
    "therefore , we set @xmath51 this ensures that @xmath52 and @xmath53 both equal unity @xcite . in practice , for the scales of interest in what follows , ( cells of radius @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 is only slightly larger than unity : 1.264 , 1.104 and 1.052 .",
    "we will compare our model for the pdf with two other useful approximations which are less physically - motivated .",
    "one is the lognormal , @xmath58 }                      { \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_s } ,   \\label{eqn : lognormal}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 . and @xmath61 is given by multiplying the kaiser factor by the @xcite fitting formula for the real space variance @xmath62 .",
    "the second is based on the finding that , in simulations , the distribution of @xmath63 is almost the same as that of @xmath64 @xcite . since the spherical model provides a good description of the @xmath64 in real space @xcite , we use it together with the kaiser factor to set @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the real space pdf with the spherical collapse model .",
    "in essence , this can be thought of as a model in which the redshift - space overdensity is a linearly biased version of the real - space overdensity , the constant of proportionality ( the bias factor ) being @xmath67 .",
    "@xcite suggests that this should be an excellent approximation on large scales ; although @xcite suggests that it is not a well - motivated approximation on intermediate or small scales , measurements of the redshift space pdf by @xcite suggest that it is nevertheless reasonably accurate .",
    "we compare our models with measurements in a simulation which was run and analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the simulation box is a periodic cube @xmath68 on a side in a cosmological model where @xmath69 .",
    "the simulation followed the evolution of @xmath70 particles , each of mass @xmath71 .",
    "halos were identified using the fof algorithm with link length 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation .    to measure the eulerian real - space pdfs we place spheres of volume @xmath12 randomly in the simulation box , and record the number of particles in each sphere , taking care to account for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we measure the redshift - space pdfs similarly , after transforming the particle positions as follows .",
    "we assume that one of the sides of the box lies parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the redshift space coordinate is then given by adding the peculiar velocity ( divided by the hubble constant ) in this direction to the real - space coordinate , taking care to account for the periodicity of the box .",
    "technically , our model of the pdf is for a continuous density field rather than for discrete particle counts . in practice ,",
    "we are interested in large enough volumes that discreteness effects are negligible , so we simply set @xmath72 .",
    "however , there is another effect which is more pernicious .",
    "the ` virial ' motions of particles within halos give rise to long fingers - of - god  this makes halos stretch about 7 times longer along the line of sight than across  an effect first noted by @xcite , which is entirely absent in the perturbation theory calculation of the redshift space pdf . to illustrate their effect on the pdf ,",
    "we have also computed redshift space positions after first setting all virial motions to zero , so that dark matter particles have the same speed as their associated halos .",
    "( i.e. we assign all particles in a halo the same velocity as that of the halo center of mass . ) in the figures which follow , filled black squares show the true redshift space measurements , and open orange squares show results when fingers - of - god are absent .",
    "figure  [ fig : xpxr8 ] shows the redshift space pdf of the dark matter in spheres of radius @xmath73 .",
    "the main panel shows this using a @xmath74-@xmath75 scale to emphasize the behaviour of the low probability tails , and the inset shows the same data using linear axes to highlight the behaviour near the peak of the distribution .",
    "filled and open squares show the measurements in the simulation ( i.e. , before and after compressing the fingers - of - god ) .",
    "these indicate that fingers - of - god are most important in the denser cells ; this is not unexpected , since dense cells host the most massive halos which have the largest virial motions .",
    "our perturbation theory based prediction is represented by the dotted ( blue ) curve  notice that it provides a significantly better fit to the simulations when the fingers - of - god have been compressed . the solid ( magenta ) curve is the perturbation theory based prediction with @xmath76 in equation  , which corresponds to using our ellipsoidal collapse model but ignoring the effect on the variance associated with differences from a spherical shape .",
    "the dotted curve ( @xmath48 ) is always closer to the measurements than is the solid one ( @xmath76 ) , consistent with the real - space results presented in @xcite ) , although the difference between the two curves is not large . in",
    "what follows , we only show results for the case when @xmath48 .",
    "the dot - dashed ( green ) curve shows the lognormal ( equation  [ eqn : lognormal ] ) and the long - dashed ( red ) curve shows equation  .",
    "our model provides a better fit than these other more empirical curves , except in the highest density tail .",
    "figure  [ fig : xpxr4 + 16 ] shows similar results for spheres of radius 4@xmath77 and 16@xmath77 . in the larger cells , fingers - of - god are irrelevant , and the lognormal provides a slightly better description than does our model , which again overshoots at large densities .",
    "the approach which assumes a simple mapping from real to redshift space overdensity fairs reasonably well at large densities , but underestimates the height of the peak of the distribution , and overestimates the pdf at lower densities .",
    "our model is substantially better than the other two in the smaller 4@xmath77 cells .",
    "in @xcite we described how the spherical collapse model could be used as the basis of a method for reconstructing the shape of the initial pdf from the eulerian one . in principle , the method can be used as a consistency check for gaussian initial conditions .",
    "we showed that , in real space , it can reconstruct the gaussian form of the initial distribution from the highly skewed nonlinear pdf on scales where the rms fluctuation is about @xmath78 or less .    extending this reconstruction method",
    "to redshift space is complicated by the fact that we know the spherical model is inadequate ( it does not reproduce the kaiser factor ) . however , the ellipsoidal collapse model , which we have shown works quite well , has many more parameters  the lengths and orientations of the three principal axes  so that the final density is determined by a stochastic rather than deterministic mapping .",
    "so we have tried a simpler approach which is based on the fact that equation  ( [ eqn : scmap ] ) provides a reasonable description of the redshift space pdf .",
    "namely , we assume that @xmath79 and use the ( square root of the ) kaiser factor in place of @xmath80 ; we have found that using our ellipsoidal collapse calculation of this quantity instead produces slightly worse results .",
    "then we set @xmath81^{-1/\\delta_{\\rm c } } }              { \\sigma_{\\rm l}(m / n_{\\rm sc})/\\delta_{\\rm c } } ,   \\label{rescalenu}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the critical linear density associated with collapse in the spherical model , and @xmath83 is the normalization factor ( the analogue of equation  [ normalize ] ) in the spherical model calculation of the real space pdf .",
    "finally , we make a histogram of @xmath84 by weighting each cell which contributes to @xmath85 by its value of @xmath86 .    before showing",
    "how well this works , figure  [ fig : nurs ] shows a test of our assumption that equation  ( [ linearbiasz ] ) is accurate , meaning that @xmath87 is linearly related to @xmath88 , with little scatter around the mean relation . evidently , these assumptions are reasonable on large scales ( bottom and middle panels ) , but become increasingly worse on smaller scales ( top ) .",
    "mpc ( top ) , @xmath89mpc ( middle ) and @xmath90mpc ( bottom ) .",
    "filled and open symbols are before and after fingers of god have been removed .",
    "they show the mean , and error bars show the rms , for narrow bins in @xmath91 .",
    "if equation  ( [ linearbiasz ] ) is accurate , then @xmath92 with little scatter . ]",
    "( histogram ) with the expected zero - mean unit - rms gaussian form ( solid curve ) .",
    "upper panels show results of reconstruction for @xmath93 scale , middle panels show results for @xmath73 .",
    "lower panels show results for @xmath56 .",
    "left- and right - hand panels show results of reconstructions which begin from the filled and open squares in the previous figures ( i.e. estimates of @xmath85 with and without fingers - of - god ) . dotted curves in each panel show the corresponding nonlinear pdfs ( equation  [ eqn : ecpdf ] ) . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : linearmap ] shows the reconstruction results for @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath94 spheres .",
    "the left- and right - hand panels show the result of transforming the pdfs shown by filled and open squares in the previous figures ( i.e. , full and compressed fingers of god ) .",
    "smooth solid curves show a gaussian distribution for comparison .",
    "the reconstruction method works well for the @xmath55 and @xmath94 scales .",
    "this method even works for the smaller @xmath95 scales if the fingers - of - god have been removed .",
    "the dotted curves show the corresponding nonlinear distributions ( equation  [ eqn : ecpdf ] ) to demonstrate that our reconstruction method transforms significantly skewed distributions back to the original symmetric gaussian shape .",
    "we have extended our previous work on the real space dark matter pdf to redshift space .",
    "to do so , we provided a simple parametrization of the evolution of the nonlinear density in the ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "this shows explicitly how the model extends both the spherical collapse model , and the zeldovich approximation ( equations  [ eqn : ecrhosc ] and [ eqn : ellred ] ) .",
    "this parametrization , with our prescription for relating spatial statistics in the initial and evolved fields ( equation  [ eqn : ecpdf ] ) , results in excellent agreement with measurements from a numerical simulation , in both real ( figure  [ fig : realpdf ] ) and redshift space ( figures  [ fig : xpxr8 ] and  [ fig : xpxr4 + 16 ] ) .",
    "our parametrization fares significantly better than analyses which are based on exact second and third order perturbative expansions of the ellipsoidal collapse evolution  these produce pdfs with a power - law tail at high densities which is a signature that the analysis is breaking down  a similar tail was seen for the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "our approach also fares better than the lognormal model , and one which assumes that redshift space overdensities are linearly proportional to those in real - space : @xmath96 where the constant of proportionality is given by the ( square - root of the ) ratio of the variances .",
    "the latter is known to be a good approximation on large scales  we find that it is accurate on small scales , except in underdense regions .",
    "we also used our results to motivate a method for reconstructing the shape of the initial pdf from the nonlinear evolved redshift space pdf .",
    "this method works well on scales where the rms fluctuation is less than 2 when fingers - of - god have been removed ( figure  [ fig : linearmap ] ) .",
    "we are in the process of applying this method to reconstruct the baryonic ascoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak in the correlation function @xcite . instead of",
    "using equation  ( [ rescalenu ] ) it is also possible to formulate the reconstruction using equations   or ; this is also the subject of work in progress .",
    "while this provides a nice graphic reconstruction of the gaussianity of the initial conditions , more work is necessary before it can be used to distinguish between a truly gaussian model and the very mildly non - gaussian models which are not yet excluded by the cmb @xcite . in this respect",
    ", it may be interesting to extend our method for estimating the nonlinear pdf to the family of non - gaussian models which are currently studied in the context of using cluster abundances and clustering to constrain primordial non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "we thank r. scherrer for pointing out that there was little understanding of why , when scaled by their variances , the real and redshift space pdfs were so similar , l. hui for urging us to go beyond an order - by - order analysis , r. e. smith for the simulation data , and the referee , v. desjacques , for a thoughtful report .",
