    "flavour - changing rare decays and oscillation parameters are known as uncircumventable tests of the standard model ( sm ) and its new - physics extensions . in the quark sector of the sm , flavour - violation",
    "is induced by the non - alignment of the yukawa matrices , resulting in a cabbibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix , and conveyed only by charged currents at tree - level . while tensions are occasionally reported ",
    "see e.g.   @xcite and references therein for a recent example  , this minimal picture seems globally consistent with the current experimental status of flavour observables @xcite , such that new sources or new mediators of flavour violation are relevantly constrained by these measurements . yet",
    ", a proper confrontation of a new - physics model to such experimental results does not depend exclusively on the accuracy of the measurements or of the theoretical predictions in the sm , but also on the magnitude of the effects induced beyond the sm ( bsm ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the well - motivated supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the sm known as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) ",
    "see @xcite for a review  , in a minimal flavour - violating version : we will assume that the squark sector is aligned with the mass - states in the quark sector , so that , at tree - level , only charged particles convey flavour - violating effects , which are always proportional to the ckm matrix .",
    "our aims consist in updating our previous work in @xcite to the current status of flavour observables and accordingly designing a tool for a test in the flavour - sector which will be attached to the public package ` nmssmtools ` @xcite . beyond ours ,",
    "several projects for the study of flavour observables in the nmssm , or more generally in susy extensions of the sm , have been presented in the literature : see e.g.   @xcite .",
    "our original work dealing with @xmath0-physics in the nmssm @xcite discussed the processes @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 as well as the oscillation parameters @xmath6 .",
    "these processes had been implemented in the fortran code ` bsg.f ` at ( grossly ) leading order ( lo ) in terms of the bsm contributions , using the nlo formalism for the sm and locally correcting it to account for nnlo effects in an ad - hoc fashion : in other words , this analysis essentially compiled results of the late @xmath7 s / early @xmath8 s @xcite . in doing so , it ignored existing nlo results in the mssm @xcite , focussed instead , at the loop level , on @xmath1-enhanced higgs - penguin contributions @xcite and only caught the early developments of the nnlo calculation in the sm @xcite .",
    "the sm analysis of @xmath3 at nnlo has been recently updated in @xcite : the corresponding results account for significant progress since @xcite and shift the sm expectation @xmath9 upwards , very close to the experimental measurement .",
    "similarly , @xmath4 has been considered up to three - loop order in the sm @xcite , shifting the result upwards with respect to the lo .",
    "moreover , lhcb and cms now provide an actual measurement of this process @xcite , which tightens the associated constraint significantly with respect to the previous upper limits .",
    "the sm status of @xmath10 has also received some attention lately @xcite . finally , several other channels  e.g.  @xmath11 , the @xmath12 or the @xmath13 transitions  have been suggested as complementary probes of new physics .",
    "in addition to these recent developments concerning the sm and experimental status of flavour processes , we note that , as the nlo contributions in supersymmetric extensions of the sm can be extracted from e.g.  @xcite , it is scientifically sound to include them into our implementation of the observables , so as to reduce the associated uncertainty in the test .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of @xmath4 , since this process is now measured and no longer simply bounded two orders of magnitude from above .",
    "the substancial shift in the sm estimate for @xmath3 also tightens the constraint on bsm effects , so that enhanced precision is relevant .",
    "our purpose in this paper consists in describing the new implementations of flavour observables within ` nmssmtools ` .",
    "we will first remind succintly of the formalism employed to account for modified higgs couplings at large @xmath1 .",
    "we will then review briefly each observable and refer explicitly to the literature that we use in their implementation : in a first step , we shall focus on processes in the @xmath0 sector before turning to kaon physics . finally , we will illustrate the workings of the new flavour constraints on the parameter space of the nmssm , comparing the results of our new implementation with the former ones in a few scenarios , and discussing the relevance of the new observables which have been included .",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm consists of two doublets @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as well as a singlet @xmath16 . as in the mssm ,",
    "the tree - level couplings to quarks involve @xmath17 and @xmath18 in a type - ii 2-higgs - doublet - model ( 2hdm ) fashion : @xmath19u_r^{c\\,f}+y_d^f\\left[h_d^-\\left(v^{\\mbox{\\tiny ckm}}_{f'f}\\right)^*u_l^{f'}-h_d^0d_l^f\\right]d_r^{c\\,f}+h.c.\\ ] ] where the diagonal yukawa parameters can be written in terms of the tree level quark masses and the higgs vacuum expectation values ( v.e.v.s )  defined as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , with @xmath22  , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 represents the ckm matrix .",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 refer to the generation index .    yet",
    ", radiative corrections , particularly those driven by the susy sector , spoil this type - ii picture and generate effective terms such as  in the @xmath28-conserving approximation : @xmath29u_r^{c\\,f}-y_d^{f}\\delta y_d^{ff'}\\left[h_u^-\\left(v^{\\mbox{\\tiny ckm}}_{f''f'}\\right)^*u_l^{f''}+h_u^{0\\,*}d_l^{f ' }   \\right]d_r^{c\\,f}+h.c.\\ ] ] while in principle a higher - order concern , such terms may be enhanced for large values of @xmath1 , so that a resummation becomes necessary for a consistent evaluation .    here , as in our original work , @xcite remains our main guide .",
    "this paper shows that the corrections to the higgs - quark couplings driven by supersymmetric loops are well approximated in an effective @xmath30-conserving theory .",
    "corrections to the down - yukawa couplings and the associated higgs - quark vertices are dominated by the loop - induced and @xmath1-enhanced contributions to the @xmath31 operator , which , in turn , can be encoded as the corrections to the down - type quark mass - matrix @xmath32 .",
    "corrections to the up - yukawa are somewhat more subtle , as @xmath1-enhanced terms do not appear at the level of the quark masses , but only at that of some  e.g.  charged  higgs couplings . there",
    ", @xcite shows that the parametrization of @xcite , complemented by additional corrections , gives competitive numerical results .",
    "we will be working within these approximations .    in this framework , all the @xmath1-enhanced higgs - quark vertices can be encoded in terms of the ` apparent ' quark masses @xmath33 and ckm matrix elements @xmath34 , as well as a bunch of ` @xmath35-parameters ' which parametrize :    * corrections to the down - type masses : @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "such diagonal contributions are mediated by gluino - sdown / neutralino - sdown or chargino - sup loops and can be extracted from eqs.(2.5 ) and ( a.2 ) in @xcite . *",
    "off - diagonal corrections to the down - type mass matrix : @xmath37 .",
    "these , in our minimal flavour violation approximation , are exclusively mediated by chargino - sup loops .",
    "eqs.(2.5 ) and ( a.2 ) of @xcite again provide explicit expressions in terms of the supersymmetric spectrum . * for the up - type couplings",
    ", @xmath38 is defined as the effective correction to the @xmath39 vertex ( see @xcite ) : @xmath40d_l$ ] .",
    "it is computed according to eqs.(5.6)-(5.8 ) of @xcite , i.e.  including relevant electroweak - gauge effects .",
    "* corrections to the ckm matrix elements can be encoded in terms of @xmath41 so that : @xmath42    the relevant flavour - changing higgs - quark couplings are then given in eqs.(3.55)-(3.61 ) and ( 5.8 ) of @xcite .",
    "we note that , in this approach , the couplings of the goldstone bosons expressed in terms of the effective quark masses and ckm elements are formally identical to the tree - level vertices expressed in terms of the tree - level masses and ckm matrix , so that the goldstone bosons do not convey explicit @xmath1-enhanced terms .",
    "another remark addresses the explicit calculation of the @xmath35-parameters : we neglect the yukawa couplings of the two first generations and assume degeneracy of the corresponding sfermions .",
    "consequently , the unitarity of the ckm matrix can be invoked in order to include the contributions of both generations at once as , e.g. , @xmath43 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    as mentioned earlier , the status of @xmath44 in the sm has substancially evolved since the analyses of @xcite .",
    "the new nnlo sm estimate for @xmath45  gev @xcite ( where @xmath46 is the cut on the photon energy ) , shifted @xmath9 upwards with respect to the older estimate , is indeed very close to the experimental measurement @xcite ( combining results from cleo , belle and babar ) : @xmath47\\right|_{e_{\\gamma}>e_0}^{\\mbox{\\tiny sm}}=(3.36\\pm0.23)\\cdot10^{-4}\\hspace{0.5cm};\\hspace{0.5cm}\\left.br[b\\to x_s\\gamma]\\right|_{e_{\\gamma}>e_0}^{\\mbox{\\tiny exp.}}=(3.43\\pm0.22)\\cdot10^{-4}\\ ] ] trying to account for this result by tuning the c - quark mass in the nlo formalism , as we did in @xcite , potentially opens new sources of uncertainty . on the other hand ,",
    "employing the full nnlo formalism is an effort - consumming task of limited interest ( in our position ) , considering that bsm effects will be included at nlo only ( see below ) .",
    "we therefore settled for a ` middle - way ' , using the nnlo formalism but encoding the pure sm nnlo effects within free parameters which are numerically evaluated by comparison with the numbers provided in @xcite .    in the nnlo formalism , one can write @xcite : @xmath48\\right|_{e_{\\gamma}>e_0}=br[\\bar{b}\\to x_c e\\bar{\\nu}]_{\\mbox{\\tiny",

    "again , the discrepancy among sm predictions and experimental measurements for the @xmath271 transition can not be interpreted in this scenario , so that applying a @xmath112 cl test for the ratios @xmath275 would lead to the exclusion of the whole portion of parameter space displayed in fig .",

    "finally , we complete this discussion by considering the parameter sets of fig .",
    "[ at500 ] , where the flavour limits discussed in the previous section were found weaker .",
    "the impact of the new channels can be read in fig .",

    "the colour / symbol code is left unchanged.,width=491 ]    therefore , we find that the new channels tested in ` bsg.f ` and ` kphys.f ` are typically less constraining than the older ones , which we discussed before .",
    "limits from @xmath268 and @xmath265 are found to be significant , however , and an evolution of the experimental limits or an improvement in understanding the sm uncertainties may provide them with more relevance in the future .",
    "the @xmath271 transition stands apart as the tension between sm and experiment resists an nmssm interpretation , at least in the scenarios that we have been considering here .",
    "we have considered a set of flavour observables in the nmssm , updating and extending our former analysis in @xcite .",
    "these channels have been implemented in a pair of fortran subroutines , which allow for both the evaluation of the observables in the nmssm and confrontation with the current experimental results .",
    "we have taken into account the recent upgrades of the sm status of e.g.  @xmath103 $ ] or @xmath276 $ ] and included bsm effects at nlo .",
    "the tools thus designed will be / have been partially made public within the package ` nmssmtools ` @xcite .",
    "we observe that the bounds on the nmssm parameter space driven by @xmath103 $ ] or @xmath276 $ ] have become more efficient , which should be considered in the light of the recent evolution of the sm status and/or the experimental measurement for both these channels .",
    "in particular , the large @xmath1 region is rapidly subject to constraints originating from the flavour sector .",
    "similarly , the light pseudoscalar scenario is tightly corseted due to the efficiency of higgs - penguins in the presence of such a light mediator .    among the new channels that we have included ,",
    "we note the specific status of the @xmath271 transition , where the discrepancy between sm and experiment seems difficult to address in a susy context .",
    "other channels of the flavour - changing sector may prove interesting to include in the future .",
    "note e.g.  the current evolution in the @xmath158 observables .",
