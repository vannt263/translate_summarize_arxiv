    "the structure and evolution of a star is determined by its mass and chemical composition .",
    "hence , the position of the star in the hr diagram is uniquely defined only when its mass and bulk metallicity are known .",
    "eclipsing and double - lined spectroscopic binaries in a detached configuration remain the primary source of directly measured fundamental stellar quantities : mass and radius .",
    "modern observational techniques are currently able to reach precisions of 12% in these parameters , a prerequisite for testing theoretical stellar evolutionary models . in their critical survey and compilation of available results , torres ,",
    "andersen & gimenez ( 2010 ) selected 95 detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) which satisfied a reasonable criterion of 3% in precision for both quantities .",
    "the effective temperatures of the component stars can not be determined directly from the analysis of light or radial velocity curves , making @xmath0 a less well - determined quantity .",
    "the metallicity has been determined for the components of only about 21 of the 95 binaries in the sample of torres et al .",
    "usually , metallicity is derived from fitting the overall spectrum of the stellar system .",
    "detailed abundance determinations have been accomplished for only _ four _ binaries : directly from the spectrum of @xmath1 aur ( lyubimkov et al .",
    "1996 ) and cvvel ( yakut et al .",
    "2007 ) , and from disentangled component spectra of v578mon ( pavlovski & hensberge 2005 ) and v453cyg ( pavlovski & southworth 2009 ) .",
    "tremendeous advances in observational stellar spectroscopy , both in spectral resolution , quantum efficiency and detector linearity , allow new opportunities in binary star research . reconstructing the individual spectra of the components opens a new window on these stars : detailed spectral analysis , atmospheric diagnostics and determination of atmospheric chemical compositions ( pavlovski 2004 , pavlovski & hensberge 2005 ) .",
    "this enables a fine probing of stellar evolutionary models and proper calibrations of fundamental stellar quantities ( pavlovski & southworth 2009 , pavlovski et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "the advantages of analysing disentangled spectra are manifold .",
    "more than a dozen methods have been invented to obtain separate spectra of the components of multiple systems from a series of composite spectra obtained at a range of orbital phase .",
    "pavlovski & hensberge ( 2010 ) divided them into three basic categories : ( i ) spectral separation ; ( ii ) spectral disentangling ; and ( iii ) spectroastrometric splitting . in all cases",
    "the isolation of individual spectra exploits the variable doppler shift of the stars .",
    "in _ spectral separation _ techniques radial velocities ( rvs ) are input data obtained from another source ( e.g.  cross - correlation ) .",
    "the method most widely used in this category is doppler tomography , developed by bagnuolo & gies ( 1991 ) .",
    "the technique of _ spectral disentangling _",
    "( spd ; simon & sturm 1994 , hadrava 1995 ) refers to the situation where both the individual spectra and the orbital parameters of the components are measured , simultaneously and self - consistently .",
    "spectroastrometric splitting _",
    "method accesses the spatial information present in long - slit spectra of partially resolved components ( see bailey 1998 ; wheelwright , oudmaijer & schnerr 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "the principles of these methods are outlined in the review papers by hadrava ( 2004 , 2009 ) , hensberge & pavlovski ( 2007 ) , and pavlovski & hensberge ( 2010 ) . without going into details we record here some new developments by konacki et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , folsom et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and kolbas & pavlovski ( this volume ) .",
    "spectral disentangling or separation techniques return individual spectra which are either in the common continuum of the system , or on an arbitrary ( generic ) continuum .",
    "the reason for this is a basic principle of spd : there is no information on the continuum light ratio of the stars if disentangling is performed on spectra where the light ratio is constant .",
    "the absolute spectral line depths are then unknown because the continuum level is unknown .",
    "the solution is to obtain spectra during eclipse , as information on the continuum level is then available .",
    "spectra during eclipse can be difficult to secure for reasons including the scheduling of observations and the lower brightness of the system at eclipse times .",
    "however , the main difficulty lies in the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "this distorts the line profiles and thus violates a basic assumption of spectral disentangling .",
    "the rossiter - mclaughlin can be only avoided by studying totally - eclipsing systems . in practice",
    "we usually have a situation in which the continuum light ratios do not vary between spectra , and spd has to be performed with arbitrary or generic light dilution factors .",
    "renormalisation then requires light factors from other sources .",
    "it is expected that the most reliable light dilution factors come from analysis of the light curves of debs .",
    "this is true , but it depends on particular cases , as discussed below .",
    "when eclipses do not occur , or observational data do not cover them , we must rely on information contained in the disentangled spectra themselves . here",
    "we list several different approaches recorded in the literature :    * for eclipsing binaries , light factors may be available from the time - independent dilution of spectral lines or from light curves ( e.g.  hensberge , pavlovski & verschueren 2000 ) .",
    "the quality of the photometry , the configuration and geometry of the binary system , or the presence of a third star , could make the light factors uncertain . *",
    "the light factors can be determined from the time - dependent dilution of the spectral lines as additional free parameters in spd calculations ( _ line photometry _ ; hadrava 1997 ) . any intrinsic line profile changes ( pulsations , spots , rossiter - mclaughlin effect , etc . )",
    "violate a basic assumption of spectral disentangling , and can cause erroneous results .",
    "* if the system is not eclipsing , some _ physical considerations _ can be used to renormalise individual disentangled spectra . in the study of the non - eclipsing triple system dgleo , frmat et al .",
    "( 2005 ) successfully used the very deep ca  iik line profiles .",
    "the requirement that the core should not dip below zero flux for any of the component spectra ( in this particular case all components are of similar spectral type ) imposed very strong constraints on the light factors .",
    "light dilution factors can also be estimated from line depths , or equivalent width ratios , once the atmospheric characteristics are fixed ( c.f .",
    "mahy et al .  2011 ) .",
    "use of line depth or line intensity ratios require chemical abundances to be specified _ a priori _ , making this option somewhat uncertain . * separated or generic disentangled spectra contain information on the intrinsic spectra . just as in the way in which information on effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath2 ) are extracted from renormalised spectra , it is possible to recover also light factors by constrained multi - parameter line - profile fitting of both disentangled spectra .",
    "tamajo , pavlovski & southworth ( 2011 ) have implemented this idea in the code genfitt .",
    "simulations using synthetic spectra showed that for a reasonable signal to noise ratio of s / n @xmath3 100 _ constrained genetic fitting _ returns reliable @xmath0 and @xmath2 for each star , plus their light factor .",
    "it is so called because the optimal fitting is constrained by requiring the sum of the light factors to be unity .",
    "@xmath2 can be derived for the stars in close binaries with precisions of 0.01dex , a crucial advantage in breaking the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath2 for balmer line profiles .",
    "comparison of the light factors derived by constrained genetic fitting and from light curve analyses is given by pavlovski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , tamajo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and southworth et al .",
    "( 2011b ) for some real - world cases . *",
    "the procedure described in the previous item could be generalised in the way that part or whole of the disentangled spectrum is fitted by theoretical spectra .",
    "tkachenko , lehmann & mkrtichian ( 2009 , 2010 ) have used this idea and fitted a large portion of spectra by gridding with precomputed theoretical spectra for a large range of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and metallicity . a similar technique has been applied by torres et al .",
    "( 2011 ) but with restriction to solar abundances , only .",
    "to determine the chemical composition of a stellar atmosphere , it is first neccessary to specify an appropriate model atmosphere .",
    "the model is described by @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) . for",
    "most eclipsing binaries @xmath2 can be determined , from analysis of light and velocity curves , with a precision and accuracy up to an order of magnitude larger than for single stars .",
    "this considerably facilitates the determination of @xmath0 , and side - steps the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath2 for hot stars .",
    "moreover , a reliable estimate of @xmath0 is possible directly from _ constrained fitting _ when the light factors are not well determined from external sources ( pavlovski et al .",
    "2009 , tamajo et al .",
    "this also makes it possible to estimate @xmath0 and @xmath2 for non - eclipsing binaries , and stipulate additional constraints in complementary solutions with interferometric observations .",
    "the first estimate of @xmath0 can be used in an iterative cycle for fine - tuning light curve and spd solutions , as was described by hensberge et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and further elaborated by clausen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "detailed abundance work makes possible further improvements in @xmath0 determination through ionisation balance .",
    "we have successfully employed the siii / siiii ionisation balance in high - mass binaries ( pavlovski & southworth 2009 ) , and the fei / feii balance in intermediate - mass binaries ( work in preparation ) .",
    "such an improvement in determination of @xmath0 is an important ingredient if one wants to use binaries for distance determination , in particular for the galaxies in local group ( e.g.  harries et al .",
    "2003 ; north et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "* high - mass stars*. despite considerable theoretical and observational efforts , some important pieces of the jigsaw of stellar structure and evolution remain unclear or missing .",
    "meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) and heger & langer ( 2000 ) found that rotationally - induced mixing and magnetic fields could cause substantial changes in theoretical predictions .",
    "some of these concern evolutionary changes in the chemical composition of stellar atmopsheres . in close binaries ,",
    "tidal effects further complicate this picture ( de mink et al .",
    "2009 ) , and pose a big challenge for observational confirmation .",

    "( in preparation ) we summarise our results for fourteen high - mass stars in eight debs , plus some additional high - mass stars in binaries studied from disentanled spectra ( simon et al .",

    "no abundance changes relative to unevolved ms stars of the same mass have been detected for these components , probably due to their relatively long orbital periods ( de mink et al .",

    "one of the many consequences of the first and rapid phase of mass transfer in close binary systems , and the eventual mass reversal and formation of algols , is the changes in chemical composition of the stars involved .",
    "in fact , algols offer an unique opportunity to probe into stellar interiors since detailed abundance studies of the layers which were once deep inside the star can give important information on the thermonuclear and mixing processes taking place during core hydrogen burning ( sarna & de greve 1996 ) .",
    "carbon should be depleted in the cno cycle even during a star s ms lifetime , and observational studies have aimed at testing these predictions ( c.f .",
