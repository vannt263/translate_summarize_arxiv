    "a more interesting case is the combination of a repelling long - range potential with an attractive short - range potential .",
    "a general method to derive the propagator for the combination of a @xmath12-function potential and another potential is based on the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation by using a laplace transform ( for examples and a discussion see @xcite , section  3.4 . ) .",

    "the laplace transform of the propagator is conveniently expressed in terms of the energy - dependent green function @xmath40 @xcite : @xmath41 if we apply the laplace transform to both sides of equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) , we can use the convolution theorem for a product of two functions ( see @xcite , 29.2.8 ) and obtain the green @xmath42 function of the full hamiltonian @xmath39 in terms of the green function @xmath43 for @xmath37 : @xmath44 the inverse laplace - transform yields the propagator : @xmath45 for the case of a @xmath12-function potential on top of an inverted oscillator we have @xmath46 the laplace transform of the propagator for the inverted oscillator ( [ eq : kisho ] ) gives rise to the parabolic cylinder function ( we use @xcite , 3.547(10 ) [ there is a misprint , the correct result is @xmath47 and 9.240 ) :    @xmath48    at the origin this expressions simplifies to @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 $ ] denotes euler s beta function ( see @xcite , 6.2 ) . in principle , we could now carry out the inverse laplace transform by integrating along the real energy axis .",
    "but since our main interest is to determine the tunneling rate for this type of potential , another method is available to extract this information .",

    "they are given by the roots of the transcendental equation @xmath51 the determination of the roots ( denoted by @xmath52 ) has to be done numerically .",
    "note , that there is another set of poles @xmath53 present , which results from the @xmath54-function in @xmath55 : @xmath56 all poles have a negative imaginary part and thus lead to a decaying wave - function for @xmath57 and fixed locations @xmath58 .",
    "however , none of the poles should be included in an evaluation of the inverse laplace transform , since the original contour runs along the real energy axis and can not be closed in the lower imaginary @xmath59-plane : the residues at the poles with negative imaginary part correspond to wavefunctions that are not bounded at infinity ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the first pole @xmath60 lies closest to the real energy axis and is directly connected to the presence of the @xmath12-potential : for @xmath33 the pole is located at @xmath61 , which is precisely the binding energy of the @xmath12-potential .",
    "the inverted - oscillator potential leads to a shift of this pole to @xmath62 an estimate for the lifetime of the decaying state is thus given by @xmath63 fig .",
    "[ fig : decayisho ] shows that the exponential decay rate is slowed down compared to the evolution in a purely inverted oscillator potential due to the attraction of the @xmath12-potential .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to obtain an exact analytic expression for the propagator of a time - dependent @xmath12-potential on top of an inverted harmonic oscillator . the basic idea is to employ a mapping procedure , which transforms the explicit time - dependent problem into a related time - independent one .",
