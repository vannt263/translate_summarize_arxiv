    "the solutions are characterized by the occurrence of large velocities ( @xmath339 ) and interaction strengths ( @xmath340 ) during the oscillations .",

    "the detailed investigation of spatio - temporal chaos presented by shraiman et al .",
    "@xcite for the unperturbed cgle is presumably robust with respect to perturbations because the sensitive parameter range is not considered there .",
    "a later investigation @xcite considers the sensitive range , where the determination of the range of existence of spatio - temporal chaos becomes questionable in the unperturbed cgle .",
    "we found that stable hole solutions suppress spatio - temporal chaos and as a consequence for a stabilizing perturbation the ( upper ) boundary of spatio - temporal chaos is simply given by the stability boundary hs ( see fig.1 ) of the nb hole solutions , whereas for destabilizing perturbation spatio - temporal chaos is also observed further up @xcite .    comparing holes in 1d with spirals in 2d",
    "one can state that spirals behave in a rough sense ( apart from topological stability ) similar to holes in the perturbed cgle with stabilizing ( decelerating ) perturbation .",

    "a core instability occurs , which is of hopf type @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the 1d case the bifurcation is subcritical in 2d and leads to spatio - temporal chaos .",
