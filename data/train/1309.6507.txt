    "is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the special case with @xmath97 is studied in ref.@xcite , where @xmath98 .",
    "figs.([fig11 - 3 ] ) show the general trait for the qubit remaining in its initial states @xmath99 for different parameter @xmath100 .",

    "this shows the coupling of the two qubits changes their dynamics considerately in the range of @xmath107 for the adiabatic approximation method to be applied , and this is our limit on the coupling parameter @xmath103",
    "here we consider the dynamics of the composite system with different initial conditions .",

    "we could write them as @xmath113 note that @xmath114 are vectors correspond to the positive and negative sign of the parameter @xmath20 respectively . so the initial fully entangled bell states of qubits can be united to be written as @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) for @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "we will consider the dynamics of the system with the two qubits in @xmath120 or @xmath121 and quantum mode field in @xmath122 .      in first case , the initial state for the two qubits is @xmath123 with @xmath116 and quantum mode field in @xmath124 with @xmath125 with probability    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the probability of quantum field state @xmath128 in its number state @xmath129 and @xmath130 . from the above eq.([p1pm to p1pm ] ) , we see that the initial entangled states @xmath131 of the two qubits will have large possibility ( @xmath132 being around @xmath133 ) to evolute into the states @xmath134 .",
    "so it is hard for the two qubits to remain its entangled states . in the following subsection , we will check that for the initial state @xmath0 .",
    "suppose the qubits is in the state @xmath0 initially , while the oscillator naturally stays in its coherent state @xmath128 .",
    "this is a very general state for a quantum processing system .",
    "the system will evolute accordingly and the probability for the qubits remain in its initial state is @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the probability of the two qubits transiting to other non - entangled states and is given as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the probability of @xmath140 photons in the coherent state @xmath128 . in the large quantity @xmath141 approximation , the quantity @xmath142 could be simplified greatly due to the fact @xmath143    we denote the term @xmath144 as @xmath145 in the above equation and will show the general properties of @xmath145 by some special parameters in fig.([fig7 ] ) .",
    "fig([fig7 ] ) also gives some examples concerning the @xmath146 in case of @xmath141 . under these assumption of rapid falling to zero of @xmath146",

    "it is more useful to delineate them in some special cases : one case that when @xmath169 with @xmath170 , and the other extreme case that @xmath171 and @xmath172 . in the first case",
    ", we obtain that @xmath173 the revival time @xmath174 and the height for its amplitude is @xmath175 which is constant in contrast to the decreasing height as time goes in ref.@xcite .    in the second case ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath176 where the fact @xmath177 are used .",
    "obviously , there is no revival phenomena in @xmath178 in this case .",
    "@xmath178 also will generally decreases as time goes except for the initially irregular transiting change .",
    "this two cases are not possible absolutely .",
    "anyway , @xmath179 may be very small with @xmath180 , and this case is close to the first case , where collapse and revival appear in @xmath153 .",
    "however , the small and non - equal - zero quantity @xmath179 contributes both the decreasing heights of the revival amplitude , as is shown in eq.([gbar1])-([gbar3 ] ) and the broadening of revivals with the time growing .",
    "the broadening of revivals also makes the collapse interval shorter and shorter until its disappearing .",
    "similarly , @xmath181 and @xmath169 means the revival time gap is greater than that in the first case .",
    "all these features all shown in fig.([fig80 ] ) .     with @xmath182.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]",
    "the above discussion might be limited or not applicable in the following case , where @xmath146 might be decrease not rapid enough that the approximation @xmath183 and @xmath184 can fails to hold . then new detailed approximation must be added .",
    "as this is seldom , we just stop here .",

    "it depends on the number @xmath140 in an extremely nonlinear and intricate way .",
    "the kind perplexity makes it hard to study the rabi model , never the less , it also provide the opportunity to preserve the entanglement of the two qubits by careful choice of the appropriate parameters . because the coherent state has the probability of poisson distribution , which will be approximated by a gauss distribution if the average number @xmath147 is large enough .",
    "the intricacy of the rabi model could be utilized to make the quantity @xmath187 in eq.([t0 - 1 ] ) extremely small when @xmath140 is in the neighborhood of @xmath147 by some selection of the appropriate parameters , which will guaranty the initial state of the qubits unchanging .",
    "this is shown in fig.([fig8 ] )",
    ". it can be easy to see that whenever we select the parameters appropriate , for example , the parameters as @xmath188 , the bell state @xmath189 have the probability about @xmath190 to remain unchanged@xcite .",
    "@xmath191 in eq.([t0 - 1 ] ) being small in the neighborhood of @xmath192 is crucial for @xmath193 .",
    "so we will select the zeros ( @xmath194 ) of @xmath2 as possible parameters for @xmath147 under definite quantities @xmath195 .",

    "@xmath20 negative and @xmath70 negative around zeros of @xmath197 of @xmath2 are keys to make @xmath198 , that is , to keep the entangled state @xmath0 unchanged .",
    "there is an alternative method for the realization of @xmath199 .",
    "one could first determine the average number @xmath193 of the coherent state of the control field , then chooses @xmath103 and @xmath20 by similar requirement that @xmath200 as larger as possible around @xmath197 .",

    "study also shows that the parameter @xmath20 negative is favorable for @xmath202 approaching zero , as fig.([fig8 ] ) exhibits .",
    "so the inter - qubit coupling is in favor of preservation of the initial entanglement , especial with asymmetrical transition case ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "all the others bell states have not this nice property because there is a simple factor @xmath133 in quantities @xmath204 in eq.([p1pm to p1pm ] ) .",
    "never the less , the preservation of the entangled bell state @xmath0 is still useful for its application in quantum information process . also , the complex formula of @xmath137 make the appropriate choice of the parameters much easier and will beneficial to the experiment application .    in summary ,",
    "coupled strongly with a quantum mode field , the two qubits dynamics is influenced by three parameters @xmath205 and the initial conditions in a very complicated form .",
    "we investigate the evolution of the four bell entangled states with the control mode in its coherent state .",
    "three out of the four bell states will become the combination of the four bell states and can not remain in their initial entangled states .",
