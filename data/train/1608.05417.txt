    "galaxies are assembled over cosmic time by the accumulation of stellar mass ( m@xmath0 ) through star - formation ( sf ) processes .",
    "this build - up is accompanied by an increase of metal content , typically measured through the gas - phase oxygen abundance ( o / h ) , the most abundant heavy element produced by massive stars .",
    "stellar mass is a measure of the integrated sf activity over the history of the galaxy , while the star - formation rate ( sfr ) indicates the current rate for conversion of gas into stars .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity ( @xmath6 ) reflects not only the metal production from high - mass stars , but also the level of galaxy interactions with environment through inflows and outflows in the form of galactic winds .",
    "given the causal relation between star - formation processes and metal content in galaxies , it is not surprising that m@xmath0 , sfr , and o / h are mutually correlated .",
    "the mass - metallicity relation ( mzr , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a manifestation of the m@xmath0@xmath7 correlation ; the sf `` main sequence '' relates m@xmath0  and sfr ( sfms , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mutual relations among the three variables extend to specific sfr ( ssfr@xmath8sfr / m@xmath0 ) and metallicity which are also correlated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these mutual correlations imply that residuals from the main relations ( mzr , sfms ) should be correlated with the third variable . indeed , from an analysis of data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , @xcite found an expression that connected the residuals in the mzr to sfr ; this was dubbed the  fundamental metallicity relation \" ( fmr ) and reduced the scatter in o / h over @xmath280000 galaxies from @xmath20.1dex to 0.05@xmath90.06dex . in a similar vein",
    ", @xcite showed that the 3d space of m@xmath0 , sfr , and o / h for @xmath233000 sdss galaxies could be expressed through a two - dimensional ( planar ) surface (  fundamental plane \" , fp ) . by fitting regressions to parameter pairs , they expressed the fp in terms of m@xmath0and found a residual variation of @xmath20.16dex , larger however than that found for the fmr .    given that reducing a three - dimensional ( 3d ) parameter space to a ( 2d ) plane is mathematically equivalent to diagonalizing the 3d covariance matrix , a natural approach to this problem is a principal component analysis ( pca ) .",
    "a pca was first applied to m@xmath0 , sfr , and o / h by @xcite for @xmath21000 galaxies from @xmath10 selected to span a range of @xmath11 in sfr and two orders of magnitude in o / h  was limited to @xmath1210.5dex@xmath13 , so those results are formally applicable only to galaxies less massive than this limit . ] .",
    "the pca showed that the principal component dominated by o / h was the component _ most dependent _ on the other two , as by itself it comprised only @xmath22% of the total variance .",
    "the pca resulted in a fp in metallicity ( fpz ) with a spread of 0.17dex in o / h , despite the vast range in the original parameters , including redshift .",
    "this fpz applied to the same sdss samples used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* here mass limited ) gave roughly the same residuals as the fmr , 0.06dex .",
    "thus , @xcite concluded that the fpz could be used to estimate metallicities with an accuracy of @xmath14% over an extended range of m@xmath0  and sfr , and moreover was a good representation of o / h at @xmath15 .",
    "it is now well established that both the mzr and the sfms extend to the highest redshifts examined so far , but with differing normalizations relative to the local universe ; at a given m@xmath0 , sfr ( and ssfr ) increases with increasing redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "consequently , if we assume that the fpz is redshift - invariant ( an assumption that we shall reassess below ) , the higher ssfrs found in high@xmath16 galaxy populations must be related , perhaps causally , to the lower metallicities observed at the same redshift .",

    "* ) ; however , these lines are even more difficult than [ oiii ]  to measure in distant galaxies .",
    "an alternative to the use of t@xmath23-diagnostic lines can be the derivation of abundances from optical recombination lines ( orls ) , because of their reduced emissivity dependence on density and temperature .",

    "the main point of this third correlation is that , at least locally , the three psuedo - observables , 12@xmath22log(o / h ) , sfr , and m@xmath0  are mutually interdependent .",

    "pc2 , the second eigenvector , holds 10@xmath911% of the variance , and is dominated by m@xmath0 , followed by sfr , and as in pc1 , with o / h again only marginal .",
    "the smallest fraction of the variance ( @xmath117% ) is contained in the third eigenvector , pc3 , which is dominated by o / h ; the implication is that o / h is the most _ dependent _ parameter , governed almost completely by m@xmath0  and sfr .",
    "moreover , this means that the 3d space defined by o / h , sfr , and m@xmath0  is degenerate ; because of the mutual correlations of the psuedo - observables , only two parameters are required to describe the properties of the galaxies .    we have also performed a pca of the sdss10 galaxies , and obtained similar results : namely , the third eigenvector , pc3 , the one dominated by o / h , contains the smallest fraction of the variance .",

    "the residuals of the fpz relation are independent of redshift to within 0.16dex , the overall uncertainty ; nevertheless the different symbols plotted in the top panel ( and the different histograms in the bottom one ) suggest some slight deviation with redshift which we will explore in sect . [",

    "such a selection can result in a basically flat trend of sfr with m@xmath0(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "this is essentially a malmquist bias since at low stellar masses , only galaxies with relatively high sfr are selected . because the mega dataset requires emission lines in order to measure metallicity spectroscopically , such an effect almost certainly plays an important role ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . ultimately , because of such selection effects , the mega dataset may not be completely representative of the sfr - m@xmath0  correlations at high redshift .",
    "nevertheless , it is the best dataset currently available for assessing the evolution of the mzr .",
    "one way to assess the redshift invariance of the fpz is by comparing the coefficients for redshift variation discussed above in sect .",
    "[ sec : redshiftvariation ] with those for the fpz .",
    "we thus performed multi - variable linear regressions on the mega dataset for 12@xmath22log(o / h )  as a function of m@xmath0  and redshift , and the same for ssfr . performing a robust fit , we find ( for the pp04n2 calibration ) :    @xmath313    with a residual standard error of @xmath20.15dex , and    @xmath314    with a residual standard error of @xmath20.44dex , the fpz in eqn .",

    "the resulting difference for the constant term is @xmath320 , again consistent with 0 within the standard errors .",
    "although this result pertains to pp04n2 , similarly small difference coefficients are obtained for the d02 and pp04o3n2 calibrations .",
    "we thus conclude that the fpz is approximately redshift invariant to within 0.15@xmath90.16dex _ ( see sect .",

    ".    nevertheless , the log(@xmath318 ) difference coefficient of @xmath321dex is slightly larger than would be expected given the residuals of the ( pp04n2 ) fpz , @xmath322dex .",

    "however , the residual standard error of the ( pp04n2 ) fit in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fpzresvsz ] ) is @xmath326dex , equivalent to the residuals of the fpz itself ; indeed , the spread of residuals at @xmath21 is as large or larger than the spread of residuals at @xmath15 .",
    "thus , while the current data suggest that the fpz may not fully describe metallicity evolution ( or its lack thereof related to sfr ) , the discrepancies are within the overall noise in the estimation .",
    "the data at @xmath327 are still relatively sparse , however , and more data with accurate metallicity measurements should help in confirming ( or refuting ) this conclusion .",
    "the fpz presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : fp ] is based on the hypothesis that the curvature in the mzr at high stellar masses is compensated by the inflection in the sfms .",
    "our results show that this hypothesis is reasonably good , at least to within @xmath20.16dex in 12@xmath22log(o / h ) .",
    "comparison of the fpz with the fmr shows that both formulations adequately represent the mutual correlations of m@xmath0 , sfr , and o / h , but also that the o / h calibration is crucial ; applying the fmr to arbitrary samples can result in metallicity offsets as large as @xmath328 to @xmath329dex , compared with the three o / h calibrations considered here .",
    "some groups have concluded that at a given redshift or over a narrow range of redshifts , that the mzr does not depend on sfr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the parameters of the mega sample in specific redshift intervals , given in table [ tab : medians ] , are comparable to the other samples used to draw these conclusions .",
    "it is likely that the broad parameter space spanned by the mega dataset contribute to the differences in the outcome .",
    "the pca analysis presented here could also play a role ; indeed , if we fit the mega data with a simple multi - variable regression of 12@xmath22log(o / h )  with respect to m@xmath0 , sfr , and redshift , we find very little dependence of o / h on sfr .",
    "this is because of the strong dependence of sfr ( and ssfr ) on redshift through the increasing normalization of the sfms ( e.g. , sect .",
    "[ sec : coevo ] ) .",
    "the mutual correlations of the variables underlying the fpz must be taken into account for any analysis considering the mzr and its dependence on sfr .    in conclusion , we have compiled a new mega dataset consisting of @xmath21000 galaxies taken from 19 individual samples spanning a wide range of stellar masses , sfrs , and metallicities and covering redshifts from @xmath18 to @xmath330 .",
    "in addition to larger numbers of high-@xmath95 galaxies , the main improvement of this dataset over that of @xcite is the common o / h calibrations derived for the mega galaxies .",
    "the main results are as follows :    = 0.05=1 @xmath331  after examining the mutual correlations among these parameters , a pca of the mega dataset shows that the 3d parameter space can be described by a plane , dubbed the fpz .",
