    "<S> plasmons are commonly interpreted with classical electrodynamics , while nonclassical effects may influence the dynamics of plasmon resonances as the plasmon confinement is approaching the few  nanometer scale . </S>",
    "<S> however , an unambiguous approach to quantify the degree of nonclassical dynamics remains . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a _ nonclassical - impact parameter _ ( nci ) to characterize the degree of nonclassical effects from an energy perspective , i.e. which fraction of the total electromagnetic energy is attributed to classical electrodynamic terms and which fraction is correspondingly to be assigned to nonclassical degrees of freedom ? we show that the nci relates directly to two fundamental parameters of plasmon resonances : the loss function and the quality factor . guided by the nci , we discuss the nonclassical effects of plasmon waveguiding modes of metallic slab waveguides , and highlight the general features of the nonclassical effects at different microscopic levels by contrasting the numerical results from the semi - classical hydrodynamic drude model ( hdm ) and the microscopic random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . the formal relation between the hdm and the rpa is also established for metals by exploring the limit of an infinite work function . </S>"
