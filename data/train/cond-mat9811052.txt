    "how a liquid freezes to form a solid is a problem of longstanding interest to physicists .",
    "freezing at thermal equilibrium can now be said to be quite well understood in terms of a first - principles order - parameter theory @xcite .",
    "the effect of steady nonequilibrium driving on the freezing transition has been studied in the context of _ sheared _ colloids @xcite . a uniformly driven state , with no gradients on the average ,",
    "as would arise in steady sedimentation @xcite or the fluidized bed @xcite is conceptually simpler : unlike in shear flow , an order - parameter description of the mean state of the driven crystal is straightforward . nonetheless , we know of no studies , experimental or theoretical , of the effect of sedimentation on the liquid - solid phase boundary in a suspension settling uniformly under gravity , or of the freezing of moving flux lattices in the _ absence _ of quenched disorder .",
    "a study of freezing in the presence of uniform driving is also of interest as a problem in the general class of driven diffusive systems .",
    "most of the investigations in this field @xcite are either away from any equilibrium phase transition or in the neighbourhood of a second order phase transition .",
    "the effect of uniform driving on a first order phase transition has received very little attention @xcite ; the freezing transition , in particular holds interesting possibilities since the ordering is at non - zero wavenumber .    in this paper",
    "we consider a collection of interacting particles in a liquid state , i.e. , with strong short - range translational correlations , and ask what happens to the liquid - solid transition in the presence of an imposed steady mean translational motion of the particles with respect to the ambient medium .",
    "our model should apply not only to charge - stabilized colloidal suspensions @xcite , but also to the effect of a steady current on the freezing transition of flux - point liquids @xcite in thin slabs of clean type ii superconductors .",
    "the main ingredient in our theory is the concentration dependence of the mobility of particles in a suspension , or of the flux - points in a superconductor . in colloidal suspensions ,",
    "this dependence arises as a result of the hydrodynamic interactions between particles , while in the flux - liquid , it is the electromagnetic interaction that is primarily responsible for the effect .",
    "although our approach is fairly general , we use parameter values appropriate to the specific case of sedimenting colloidal suspensions in the rest of the paper .",
    "our main results are as follows : as the mean concentration of the suspension is increased , the hydrodynamic interaction causes it to settle more slowly @xcite .",
    "we show that this leads to a nonlinearity in the equations of motion whose effect is to reduce the height of the structure factor relative to its equilibrium value .",
    "the suppression is strongly anisotropic , largest for wavevectors along the direction of mean drift , and vanishing for wavevectors normal to it .",
    "the reduction is most pronounced at the location of the peak , which means the strong short - range correlations in the liquid , which are the precursor of translational order , are suppressed .",
    "this inevitably leads to a shift of the phase boundary towards the crystal side ( i.e. , favours the liquid over the crystalline phase ) , by an amount proportional to the square of the pclet number , in a manner reminiscent of a proposed mechanism @xcite for shear - induced melting .",
    "this nonequilibrium phase transition now assumes additional importance in the wake of recent experiments on charged fluidized beds @xcite where it should be possible to test our predictions .",
    "constraints on the types of systems to which our theory should apply are discussed at the end of section [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ introfreezing ] gives an overview of equilibrium freezing .",
    "the equations describing the motion of a sedimenting suspension are derived in section [ freezingeomsection ] . in section [ freezingphasetrans ]",
    "we discuss in a general setting the prescription used in this paper to describe a nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "the perturbative calculation leading to the equal time correlation function in the driven system is the content of section [ freezingperturbation ] , and our numerical results for the structure factor are given in section [ freezingstrucfac ] . in section [ freezingfreezing ]",
    "we derive our results for the freezing transition , and conclude in section [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the equilibrium phase - transition from a liquid to a crystal is the spontaneous appearance of a static , spatially periodic modulation in the density field of the liquid .",
    "an order parameter theory of this transition @xcite . is obtained by writing down the free - energy cost of such a modulation as a functional of the density field .",
    "the free energy cost of an inhomogeneous density field @xmath0 relative to the uniform liquid state of density @xmath1 is given by @xcite & = & f / k_b t + & = & c(|- | ) ( ( ) - _ 0 ) ( ( ) - _ 0 ) + & & + , [ ryf ] where @xmath2 is the direct correlation function of the liquid .",
    "the second term in ( [ ryf ] ) is an ideal gas entropy , whereas the first comes from correlations in the interacting system .",
    "expanding the logarithm and stopping at the second order in the density fluctuation @xmath3 , gives the quadratic part of the free - energy in terms of the fourier modes @xmath4 as : = ^2 in terms of the dimensionless structure factor = .",
    "the density correlation function at equilibrium is related to the structure factor by the relation ( - ) = v _ 0 where v is the system volume .",
    "all information about temperature and mean density is encoded in the liquid - state direct correlation function @xmath2 . for a given @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath5 corresponding to the thermodynamically stable state , within mean - field theory , is the global minimum of @xmath6 $ ] , obtained in principle by solving @xmath7 , and choosing that solution for which @xmath8 is the smallest . at low densities and high temperatures",
    ", the global minimum is @xmath9 . for sufficiently dense , cold systems ,",
    "this uniform liquid state is unstable relative to a spatially periodic @xmath10 , the crystal .",
    "terms in @xmath8 of order higher than quadratic in @xmath11 are clearly essential to give such a solution .",
    "although the best theories of freezing @xcite go the whole log , we shall sacrifice accuracy in favour of simplicity , and use a quartic polynomial approximation to @xmath8 .",
    "since we are looking for periodic density waves , it is convenient to work with @xmath12 , the weights of the bragg peaks at the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath13 , defined by = _",
    "g _ ( - ) .",
    "since the peak of the liquid - state structure factor at its first maximum @xmath14 is much higher than the subsequent peaks , we restrict ourselves to fourier amplitudes of @xmath15 close to this peak .",
    "this is equivalent to considering only the first shell of reciprocal lattice vectors for the crystal .",
    "only the form of the s(k ) near the peak matters then , and @xmath16 can be replaced by a lorentzian s^-1(g ) = a + ( g^2 - k_0 ^ 2 ) ^2 so that the peak height is s(k_0 ) = a^-1 .",
    "the landau free energy per particle is then given by & = & _ + & & - b _ 0 ^ 2 _ , , _ * g*_1 + * g*_2 + * g*_3,0 + & & + c _ 0 ^ 3 _  _ * g*_1 + * g*_2 + * g*_3 + * g*_4 , 0 .",
    "+ [ flandauintro2 ]    if @xmath17 , then free energy costs strongly discourage the fourier amplitudes to stray from the peak of the structure factor , i.e @xmath18 .",
    "the free energy can then be expressed as a function of a single scalar order parameter @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of reciprocal lattice vectors in the set ( i.e. 6 for a triangular lattice , 12 for bcc etc ) .",
    "note that at nonzero wavevector @xmath13 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are identical .",
    "the free energy per particle per @xmath23 is thus a polynomial f = = a r^2 - b r^3 + c r^4 , [ flandauintrooneop ] with @xmath24 { \\rho_0}^3 c. \\label{landauparameterc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ landauparameters ] here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are numbers that depend on the type of lattice being considered : @xmath25 is the number of such triplets or triangles that each rlv belongs to , and @xmath26 is the number of non - planar diamonds that the rlvs can form among themselves @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath27 at which the transition occurs is found by demanding that the free energy be zero at the crystalline minimum .",
    "this leads to the value of @xmath27 at the transition , a_c = .    the cubic term favours lattice structures in which the rlvs form triangles in sets of three .",
    "the candidate lattices , within the one order parameter theory , are the ones whose rlvs correspond to edges of regular polyhedra or polygons with triangular faces , i.e. planar triangular ( whose rlvs form a pair of triangles ) , face centred cubic ( octahedron ) and icosahedral ( icosahedron ) lattices .",
    "the theory predicts that all crystals should be triangular lattices in two dimensions and body centred cubic ( which has a face centred cubic reciprocal lattice ) in three dimensions .",
    "given the lack of sophistication , the theory is reasonably successful as almost all two dimensional crystals are triangular lattices , and many , if not all elemental solids in three dimensions are indeed bcc , at least close to freezing @xcite .",
    "the theory discussed above has several drawbacks : it neglects all structure in s(k ) except that at the peak and assumes that all wavevectors have the same order parameter amplitude .",
    "these assumptions can be relaxed and a more complete theory written down , but the landau expansion itself is questionable , in fact inaccurate , since the order parameter jump at freezing is large .",
    "it would doubtless be better to generalize the first - principles density - wave approach of ramakrishnan and yussouff @xcite to include the effects of sedimentation . in the present work , however , we have attempted only a nonequilibrium generalizations of the simple and intuitive landau - alexander - mctague theory , as a first step in taking into account the effect of sedimentation on freezing .",
    "an extension of our approach to more realistic freezing theories should be fairly straightforward .",
    "the frictional force on a spherical particle of radius @xmath28 moving slowly in a fluid with shear viscosity @xmath29 with a uniform speed @xmath30 is given by @xcite = 6 r v [ stokeslaw ] the dimensionless parameter which gives a measure of the relative importance of sedimentation with respect to brownian motion is the pclet number , defined as the ratio of the time taken by the particle to diffuse a characteristic distance @xmath31 to the time taken to settle the same distance under gravity , without diffusing . in terms of the mean settling speed @xmath32 of the particle , the pclet number is given by pe = .",
    "the appropriate dimensionless measure ( which we will continue to call the pclet number ) of the relative importance of drift versus diffusion for this problem , will turn out to be proportional to the pclet number defined at the scale of an interparticle spacing , but will incorporate certain collective effects whose nature will become clear below after we construct our equations of motion .    although the single particle problem was solved in 1851 @xcite , the sedimentation speed of a suspension",
    "was theoretically obtained as recently as 1972 @xcite , and that too in the dilute limit .",
    "the speed of a strictly random suspension of volume fraction @xmath15 turns out to be _ less _ than that of a single sphere : v _ = ( 1 - 6.55 + ( ^2 ) ) v _ [ hinderfluid ] thus , at a volume fraction of @xmath33 , the settling speed is reduced to @xmath34 of the stokes value .",
    "it has been also observed experimentally @xcite that the mean settling speed of a suspension is less than that of a single particle , and a decreasing function of the concentration of suspended particles . in other words ,",
    "the mobility of a region is a function of the local concentration .",
    "the sedimenting suspension that we speak of is an idealized bottomless tube of infinite height containing a solvent in which there is a steady downward flow of particles ( denser than the solvent ) .",
    "an ` infinite ' tube is realized in real life by means of a setup known as a fluidized bed @xcite , a vertical tube through which fluid is pushed up at a steady rate by an externally maintained pressure head , with particles suspended stably on the average by the balance between gravity and the viscous drag of the upflow of fluid .",
    "the problem of the steadily sedimenting particle in the comoving frame of reference is identical , in the infinite container limit , or far from the walls of the container , to the fluidized bed problem in the lab frame .",
    "for very dilute solutions , the reduced weight of the particle ( i.e. the weight minus the buoyant force ) is balanced by the single particle stokes friction . at higher concentrations , hydrodynamic interactions between the spheres",
    "@xcite becomes important , leading to a hindered settling speed , the effect of which we investigate .",
    "consider now a collection of interacting particles , on the average in a liquid state with uniform number density @xmath1 , moving through a frictional medium . in the absence of external forces ( such as gravity )",
    "the number density @xmath0 follows the equation : = ^2 + , [ eomeq ] where @xmath35 is the collective diffusion constant , @xmath29 is a gaussian white noise consistent with thermal equilibrium : = 2 k_b t ^2 ( - ) ( t - t ) , [ noiseeq ] and @xmath8 is the free - energy functional defined in [ ryf ] .",

    "note that the equation of motion [ eomeq ] combined with the noise statistics ( [ noiseeq ] ) will take the system to an equilibrium state with a probability distribution p ~e^- f / k_b t.    in the presence of a constant external force , which we take for specificity to be a uniform gravitational field @xmath41 the particles sediment with a steady mean drift velocity @xmath42 @xcite , where @xmath43 is the concentration - dependent mobility , which in the low density limit , is expected to go to the stokes value @xmath44 the current then acquires an extra piece @xmath45 leading to an additional term of the form - m g [ extraterm ] on the right hand side of equation ( [ eomeq ] ) .",
    "here @xmath46 is the reduced or archimedean weight of the solute particles , mg = m_0 g - m_g , with @xmath47 being the mass of the particle , and @xmath48 the mass of solvent displaced by submerging it .",

    "thus one would see a net drift along gravity in this frame .",

    "the term within the brackets is a dimensionless number that vanishes in the dilute limit . for sedimenting suspensions , the mobility is a decreasing function of concentration , so @xmath57 since @xmath58 and @xmath59 are a diffusion constant and a velocity respectively , together they give the appropriate dimensionless coupling ( which we will call the pclet number @xmath60 ) for the problem : @xmath61}_{\\r0 } , \\label{peclet2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ peclet ] where @xmath31 is the average interparticle spacing in the suspension .",
    "note that we are using @xmath31 rather than the particle size as the length scale to define the pclet number .",
    "this is reasonable since we are considering collective rather than single particle effects . in terms of the single particle diffusion constant @xmath62 , which is related to the bare mobility by the einstein relation @xmath63 ,",
    "the pclet number can be written as pe = ( ) ( ) _ 0 ( ) .",
    "[ peclet3 ] the last piece ( in parentheses ) in ( [ peclet3 ] ) is the particle - size pclet number for a single sphere , which is simply the ratio of the gravitational potential energy drop across the size of the particle to the thermal energy @xmath23 .",

    "the hydrodynamic interactions appear through the third piece in [ peclet3 ] ( in square brackets ) .",
    "it should be noted that this term is indeed nonzero even if the mobility is a linear function of concentration .",

    "to the lowest order in the polyball size r , therefore , the piece in square brackets in [ peclet3 ] is proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "the pclet number thus goes as @xmath68 for particle of mass @xmath69 and radius @xmath28 . as @xmath70 , the hydrodynamic interaction between the spheres goes away , and the pclet number goes to zero as @xmath71 if we keep the mass fixed , and as @xmath72 if we change the radius of the particle keeping the density fixed .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ freom ] ) of the density fluctuation is the equilibrium dynamical equation with an additional nonlinearity of the burgers type @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the nonlinear term may be understood in terms of a lattice gas model @xcite , where particles are driven in one direction by a constant field , but a particle is allowed to hop to the next site only if it is empty ( no double occupancy ) .",
    "this microscopically models a mobility depending on the local density  in regions where the density is large , the probability of hopping being obstructed by the presence of other particles is larger , and hence the mobility smaller .",
    "the current at site @xmath73 is then proportional to @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the discretized density in a bin at @xmath73 . on coarse",
    "graining this will give two terms : a term @xmath76 , which can be removed by a galilean transformation ; and another @xmath77 , which persists even in the comoving frame . before moving on to use ( [ freom ] ) to calculate the correlations in the suspension ,",
    "let us briefly discuss the limitations of our model .",
    "first , we have only considered one effect of sedimentation , namely the dependence of concentration on mobility .",
    "this is a coarse - grained description of the hydrodynamic interactions , reliable only at long wavelengths .",
    "a better theory should consider , for example , gradient - dependence in the mobility , i.e. , the diffusivity at wavenumber @xmath78 should have corrections of @xmath79 for a suspension of particles of size @xmath28 .",
    "since we are interested in ordering phenomena at finite wavevectors @xmath80 , our theory should give reliable results for @xmath81 which is satisfied , for example , for strongly charge stabilized colloids where the ordering length scale @xmath82 is of order the screening length , @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , we have ignored the dependence of the mobility on more detailed aspects of the local distribution of particles , e.g. , its anisotropy , a point which we comment on at the end of this paper .",
    "secondly , we have also ignored the concentration - dependence of the diffusion constant @xmath58 in ( [ eomphi ] ) .",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath58 should have the same concentration dependence as @xmath84 , since the two are related by the einstein formula .",
    "a correct formulation of the problem with @xmath85 would require a multiplicative noise ( of the form @xmath86 $ ] where @xmath37 is a spatiotemporally white noise with unit variance ) to make the equations of motion consistent with equilibrium .",
    "this problem is technically much more difficult @xcite , and we believe it should nt change the results dramatically for the following reason .",
    "a concentration - dependent diffusion constant coupled with a consistent noise of the above type is an _ equilibrium _ effect , and an ( effective ) concentration independent @xmath58 with ordinary gaussian noise leads to the same equilibrium distribution .",
    "the nonlinear term in ( [ eomphi ] ) is the _ only driving term _ arising from concentration dependence . in any case ,",
    "( [ freom ] ) is the simplest driven - diffusive model with a liquid - solid transition and the correct equilibrium limit , and thus merits study in its own right .",
    "lastly , we have also ignored the long - ranged effects of the hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "our description corresponds to a quasi two - dimensional suspension confined between parallel walls with spacing @xmath87 .",
    "the walls cut off the hydrodynamic forces on lateral scales much larger than @xmath87 , making them effectively short range .",
    "the _ local _ effects of the hydrodynamic interactions are , however , accounted for by the concentration dependent mobility . to describe the three dimensional problem we have to explicitly include the the hydrodynamic velocity - field of the suspension in the description .",
    "although this could have far - reaching effects at small wavenumber , it should be relatively unimportant for the statics of crystallization , whose physics is dominated by wavenumbers near the structure - factor peak .",
    "since we are interested in the freezing transition , we set up the equation of motion ( [ freom ] ) for the density field , with a free energy functional that leads to a freezing transition in equilibrium .",
    "the simplest of these is the landau - alexander - mctague free energy functional which we have discussed in section [ introfreezing ] . a spatially inhomogeneous density fluctuation @xmath88 ( fourier transform @xmath4 ) has , relative to the uniform fluid , a free energy @xcite    & = & + & & - b + & & + c + & & ( * p* ) ( - -*p* ) [ freeenalexmctague ] where @xmath89 is the equilibrium structure factor of the suspension .",
    "the density correlation function at equilibrium calculated using the above free energy is , to quadratic order , = _ 0 ( + ) .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ freom ] ) becomes in reciprocal space & & = - _ 0 k^2 + & & + i k_z + ( ) , [ eomkwithfeom ] + & & ( , t ) ( , t ) = 2 k^2 _ 0 ( + ) ( t - t ) .",

    "[ eomnoneq ] where the contribution of anharmonic terms in the free energy have not been put in .",
    "this is because we are iterested in the _ corrections _ to the equilibrium bare correlation funtions due to the driving term .",
    "it is easy to see that the additional nonlinear term in equation ( [ freom ] ) or ( [ eomnoneq ] ) can not be expressed in a form so as to be absorbed into an additional term in the free energy .",
    "this is done by checking that the functional curl of the term is nonvanishing",
    ". we will call this term in ( [ eomnoneq ] ) the sedimentation nonlinearity .    to describe phase transitions in this nonequilibrium problem , we follow earlier work on critical phenomena in the presence of shear @xcite and shear - induced melting of colloidal crystals @xcite .",
    "we assume that the fokker - planck equation that derives from the above langevin equation ( [ eomnoneq ] ) has a steady solution in the long time limit , which we write as p [ ] ~e^- [ probss ] and expand the functional @xmath90 in a taylor expansion = _ 2 ( 1,2)(1 ) ( 2 ) + _ 3 ( 1,2,3 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) +  where @xmath91 etc .",

    "the summation convention is implied for repeated arguments .",
    "the @xmath93 are the vertex functions .",
    "the calculation of moments from this probability functional gives , for the connected parts , the relations @xcite @xmath94 [ corlsandvertex ] and so on , which are the usual relations between the connected correlation functions and vertex parts .",
    "the only difference here is that the steady state probability distribution is not the inverse exponential of the equilibrium free energy functional .",
    "the vertex functions @xmath95 above have to be therefore calculated from the steady state probability distribution @xmath96 .",
    "however , the correlation functions can be calculated from the langevin equation itself by demanding that the time derivative of all moments is zero , and these may be used in ( [ corlsandvertex ] ) to calculate the vertex functions upto any desired order , which gives the steady state @xmath96 to the same order in the taylor expansion .",
    "for instance , @xmath97 [ corlsandvertexk ] the second of these relations can be rewritten in terms of the structure factor as = - _ 3 ( , , ) _ 0 ^ 3 s(k_1)s(k_2)s(k_3 ) .",

    "this @xmath96 can be treated as a mean - field probability distribution which may be maximized to find the stable phase at any given temperature . in other words ,",
    "@xmath99 $ ] can be treated as a nonequilibrium free energy .",

    "the four - point vertex @xmath103 will also have a correction at second order , but we ignore this correction as this is simply a stabilizing term and small changes in it will not affect the physics of freezing significantly . in this section",

    "multiplying the equation of motion ( [ eomnoneq ] ) by @xmath104 , symmetrizing in @xmath105 and setting time derivative of the two - point function to zero , we obtain for _ equal time _ a relation between the two - point and the three - point functions : 2 & & = + i k_z & & + & + & 2 n k^2 , [ twopointequaltime ] where we have used the equal - time correlation between the noise and the density fluctuation , ( -,t ) ( , t ) = n k^2 , [ noiseandensityequaltime ] which is proved in detail in the appendix . here",

    "if we proceed in this manner we will keep obtaining higher - order correlations in terms of the lower ones .",

    "the effect of the corrected three - point vertex as well as the structure factor correction have to be considered while describing the liquid - solid transition in the presence of sedimentation .",

    "this ` phase shift ' in the order parameters may be visualized in real space as a shift of one set of lattice planes relative to its equilibrium position .",
    "note that scattering experiments measure only the squared modulus @xmath147 , and will not see a phase shift .",
    "freezing is determined by the _",
    "modulus _ of the modified coefficient of the cubic term , which is b .",
    "the prefactor multiplying @xmath148 is a number that depends on the type of lattice . for a triangular lattice in two dimensions , @xmath149 ( six reciprocal lattice vectors in the first shell ) and @xmath150 ( each reciprocal lattice vector belongs to one of the two triangles ) .",
    "[ modbcorrection ] clearly , the magnitude of @xmath137 can only increase due to sedimentation .",
    "thus , as far as this term is concerned , sedimentation seems to favour ordering .",
    "this effect has to compete with the reduction of the structure factor and only a quantitative analysis can decide their combined effect .    in the rest of this section we present results for the simplest case , that of a planar triangular lattice .",
    "we have described the equilibrium freezing with a one - order parameter landau theory , choosing the landau coefficients to match the structure factor peak height at coexistence for our data , i.e. @xmath151 .",
    "our landau parameters were @xmath152 and , at coexistence , @xmath153 , giving a polynomial f = 0.10107 a r^2 - r^3 + 2.5 r^4 where @xmath154 is the reduced order parameter , defined in ( [ opr ] ) .",
    "note that the correction @xmath155 [ eqn .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) ] vanishes if the reciprocal lattice vectors remain on the shell @xmath156 , and the structure factor remains unchanged .",
    "this follows from ( [ bchange ] ) and the fact that the sum of @xmath157 has to be zero .",
    "thus , to benefit from the free energy reduction that an increase in @xmath137 can cause , the lattice may like to distort , thus sending one of the vectors out of the shell while keeping the sum equal to zero by rotating the other two towards or away from each other .",
    "we have considered two such distortions in our analysis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figdistperp ] , which seem to be most likely from the symmetry of the problem .",
    "it is also imaginable that the lattice distorts to an asymmetric state with two degenerate minima of the free energy ; we have not made a complete scan of all possible distortions to rule out such possibilities , but looked at only the above two on grounds of plausibility .",
    "such distortions apart , the structure factor is itself affected by the driving , so @xmath155 is nonzero even without pushing the reciprocal lattice vectors out of the shell .",
    "the undistorted crystal is therefore also a strong candidate .",
    "the crucial issue is the relative importance of the two effects : @xmath155 and @xmath129 .",
    "though the correction to the three - point vertex is first order in @xmath60 , the correction to @xmath137 for small @xmath60 goes as @xmath158 as can be seen simply by binomially expanding the square - root in ( [ modbcorrection ] ) . for this reason , combined with the fact that the numerical value of @xmath155 is rather small at modest driving rates ,",
    "the @xmath159 effect is negligible compared to the structure factor reduction . for the landau potential chosen ,",
    "we have found numerically that the structure factor reduction makes the free energy function go unstable well before @xmath137 can change significantly .",
    "the physics , therefore , is dominated entirely by the structure factor .",
    "this implies that sedimentation will neccessarily lead to a shift of the liquid - solid phase boundary towards the solid side . in other words , since the correlations are reduced , a system which was at liquid - solid coexistence in the absence of sedimentation will choose the _ liquid _ phase if sedimentation is switched on .",
    "the reduction of the structure factor peak height is maximum along the sedimentation direction and falls monotonically as the angle with respect to the horizontal is decreased , going to zero in the horizontal direction .",
    "it is therefore expected that one of the wavevectors will point along the @xmath160 direction .",
    "this immediately rules out the possibility shown in fig .",
    "[ figdistperp](a ) in favour of that shown in fig .",
    "[ figdistperp](b ) .",
    "even if there is no distortion , this orientation is the best among the undistorted ones .",
    "we now ask : is there any reason the lattice may wish to distort due to structure factor effects alone ?",
    "consider the distortion sketched in fig .",
    "[ figdistperp](b )  the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath161 growing slightly larger ,    @xmath160 axis so as to keep the sum of the vectors zero .",
    "if the pclet number is not too large , @xmath129 continues to have a peak at @xmath162 even in the presence of sedimentation ( section [ freezingstrucfac ] ) , so that there is a free energy cost to pay for the expanding @xmath161 which is moving off the peak .",
    "the other two , however , have moved closer to the horizontal , i.e. in a direction such that the driving affects them less , and the peak height at these wavevectors is higher than it would have been had they not rotated at all .",
    "there is a competetion between these two effects , and its not _ a priori _ clear which will win , so we computed the free energy of distorted crystals at coexistence to find the most favourable value of the distortion or angle .",
    "note that in any case the liquid is the favoured phase , but we can still search among all the crystalline phases and find which of them has the lowest free energy .",
    "this , as we demonstrate shortly , gives us some hint as to what to expect at other temperatures .",
    "we found that for low pclet numbers the undistorted crystal is favoured , but at around @xmath163 a distorted crystal becomes favourable ( fig .",
    "[ figdeltavpe ] ) .",
    "there seems to be a first order jump in what we might call the distortion order parameters @xmath164 .",
    "this is not surprising , as we may regard the nonequilibrium free energy coming out of our analysis as a function of @xmath164 , whose power series expansion will have odd order terms since @xmath165 is not a symmetry of the problem .",
    "the distorted crystal appears at rather high pclet number ( fig .",
    "[ figdeltavpe ] ) , certainly well beyond the range of validity of our perturbation theory .",
    "the reason for the sudden distortion is probably related to the original peak @xmath162 becoming a minimum and two peaks developing on either side ( fig .",
    "[ figskvk2d ] ) .",
    "the several plateaus that appear at even higher @xmath60 are even more intriguing .",
    "the intriguing results regarding split peaks ( figs .",
    "[ figskvk2d],[fig3dskvk ] ) and distortions are however somewhat speculative in the absence of a reliable theory for large driving .",
    "we have also compared the configurations shown in figs [ figdistperp](a ) , and [ figdistperp](b ) and found , as expected , that the latter has a lower free energy at all values of the driving .",
    "thus one immediate consequence of our theory is that the crystal , when it forms , will form with the orientation shown in fig .",
    "[ figdistperp](b ) , i.e. with lattice planes parallel to the sedimentation direction .",
    "this agrees with intuition , since there are shocks @xcite travelling along the sedimentation direction .",
    "finally , one would like to look at the system below the equilibrium freezing temperature @xmath166 , and find how the melting pclet number depends on @xmath167 . strictly speaking this requires structure factor data in the supercooled liquid",
    ", which one should use in ( [ skintegral ] ) to compute the corrected @xmath129 .",
    "such data , however , is not readily available , and in particular for the case of the planar triangular lattice that we are considering , it is very hard to sustain a supercooled liquid for too long in a simulation with monodisperse systems .",
    "we therefore attempt the following approximate theory . near @xmath166 ,",
    "the structure factor is that at coexistence plus a perturbative correction . the critical pclet number @xmath168 at which the crystal melts is an object which is itself perturbative in @xmath167 . in calculating @xmath168 ,",
    "if we neglect the perturbative corrections to @xmath169 , we will be making an error only at a higer order .",
    "we can therefore legitimately do a landau theory at a @xmath170 below but close to @xmath166 using the structure factor _ at coexistence_. the @xmath129 corrections will all be calculated using this @xmath171 , the temperature entering only in the landau parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ sedpdg ] .",
    "we have shown that a uniform drift , as in steady - state sedimentation , reduces translational correlations in a suspension of interacting brownian particles , as a result of local hydrodynamic interactions that reduce the mobility of a dense region .",
    "this reduction is largest in the direction of sedimentation . at sufficiently high pclet number , the first peak of the structure factor splits due to the fact that the reduction is strongest where the initial correlation was largest .    for the freezing transition we find that the phase boundary in a charge stabilized colloidal suspension shifts towards the crystal side .",
    "the shape of the phase boundary is quadratic in @xmath60 as shown in fig .",
    "[ sedpdg ] .",
    "let us now make some estimates for pclet numbers in realistic experimental situations to see whether the values of @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ sedpdg ] are accessible .",
    "the pclet number for a dense suspension , at the scale of the particle radius , is given by eq .",

    ", we note that this is true for volume fraction between @xmath173 and @xmath174 @xcite . the volume fraction used in our calculations ( @xmath123 , from the cutoff used for the integrals , i.e. volume fraction @xmath175 ) falls within this range . > from the data presented in @xcite , the term within the square brackets in ( [ pecletinremarks ] )",
    "is found to be of order @xmath176 .",
    "the first term @xmath177 in ( [ pecletinremarks ] ) is the ratio of the bare to the collective diffusion constant , which has a value of about @xmath178 near the freezing transition of a colloidal suspension @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the interparticle spacing to the radius of the polyballs , @xmath179 , is @xmath180 .",
    "the product of the first three factors in [ pecletinremarks ] is thus @xmath181 .",
    "finally , we have to estimate the bare pclet number @xmath182 .",
    "this turns out to be @xmath183 for polystyrene @xcite .",
    "the pclet number for the interacting suspension is therefore @xmath184 .",
    "this is rather large , which means that our lowest - order theory is probably not reliable here .",
    "it does however suggest that the effect of steady - state sedimentation on freezing should be large for this system .    in general , in choosing a system on which to test our results , two competing needs",
    "must be kept in mind . on the one hand",
    ", the ordering length scale should be large compared to the particle size , so that the simple concentration - dependence of the mobility ( see the remarks towards the end of section [ freezingeomsection ] ) in our model is valid . on the other hand , the particle size itself should be large enough to give an appreciable peclet number .",
    "a comparison with shear induced melting is tempting , since a perturbation theory similar in spirit to the present approach @xcite is known to give a shift in the phase boundary that is quadratic in the shear rate .",
    "there are essential differences however : firstly the _ only _ significant effect of shear is to suppress correlations , whereas for a sedimenting suspension , there are nontrivial corrections to the three point vertex .",
    "the effect of these latter corrections happens to be negligible on the freezing transition as we have shown , making the phase boundary shift in a manner similar to the shear case .",
    "secondly , the sheared colloidal crystal at low shear - rates is a slightly distorted crystal essentially stuck in a statically sheared configuration . at low shear therefore ( where perturbation theory is valid ) , the crystal is essentially in an equilibrium state , and its properties can be derived from an equlibrium picture @xcite . for uniform driving , however , there are nonzero currents even at low pclet numbers , making it a more genuinely nonequilibrium problem .    an interesting feature of our theory is that the sign of @xmath185 does not figure in the results .",
    "thus even if we have a suspension whose settling speed",
    "_ increases _ due to many body effects , our theory will still predict a reduction in the correlations and a consequent shift in the phase boundary towards the crystal side .    finally , a few caveats . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that a sedimenting colloidal crystalline lattice is likely to be unstable at long wavelength .",
    "the theory proposed in this paper is probably nonetheless applicable to the formation of the crystalline phase at least at low pclet numbers , since the physics of freezing is centred primarily around the ordering wavenumber .",
    "the coupling of concentration and shear ( tilt ) considered in @xcite may also be important in the liquid state .",
    "the detailed consequences will be different because shear stresses have a finite lifetime in the liquid , in contrast to that in a solid where it lasts for ever if the strain is present .",
    "the effect of the sedimentation instability is thus very different in a liquid .",
    "this is an additional aspect that we have totally ignored in the above treatment , and one that a more sophisticated approach must address .",
    "however , further development of the theory should be motivated by experiments , which we eagerly await .",
    "consider a set of langevin equations of the form & = & f ( ) + _ , [ fraplang ] + & = & 2 k_b t _",

    "<S> we study the liquid - solid transition in a collection of interacting particles moving through a dissipative medium under the action of a constant , spatially uniform external force , e.g. a charge - stabilized suspension in a fluidized bed or a flux - point lattice moving through a thin , current - carrying slab of type ii superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility of a given region in these systems is in general a function of the local concentration . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the structure factor peak is suppressed in an anisotropic manner as a result of this effect , resulting in a shift of the crystal - liquid phase boundary towards the crystal side . </S>",
