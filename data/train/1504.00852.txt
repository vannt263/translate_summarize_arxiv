    "_ @xmath105 by definition , the hermitian domain @xmath17 is an open subset of the space of isotropic lines in @xmath18 . restricting the tautological bundle on @xmath18 yields a line bundle @xmath106 on @xmath17 , which descends first to the orbifold @xmath107 , and then to the canonical model @xmath0 .",

    "see  [ ss : analytic ] for the precise definition .",
    "the following appears in the text as theorem [ thm : mainthm ] .",
    "[ bigthm : a ] assume that the discriminant of @xmath54 is odd , and let @xmath118 and @xmath119 be the class number and number of roots of unity in @xmath54 , respectively .",

    "the analogous theorem for shimura varieties associated with unitary similitude groups was proved in @xcite .",
    "[ rem : eisenstein intro ] the convolution @xmath3-function appearing in the theorem can be realized by integrating @xmath125 and @xmath126 against a certain eisenstein series @xmath127 .",
    "this eisenstein series vanishes at @xmath128 , and hence the same is true of @xmath124 .",
    "as noted earlier , our cycles @xmath129 arise from embeddings of rank two tori into @xmath8 .",
    "one could instead look at the cycles defined by embeddings of maximal tori ; these are the _ big cm cycles _ of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we prove a result analogous to theorem [ bigthm : a ] in this setting .",
    "we show that it implies an averaged form of colmez s conjecture on the faltings heights of cm abelian varieties ( via the method of yang @xcite ) . this has provided a key ingredient in j. tsimerman s recent proof of the andr - oort conjecture @xcite , which characterizes shimura subvarieties of shimura varieties of hodge type by means of special points .    if one is willing to have the equality of theorem [ bigthm : a ] only up to rational multiples of @xmath130 , in principle it should be possible to drop the assumption that @xmath131 is odd or that @xmath132 is maximal and replace it by the weaker assumption that @xmath132 is maximal away from @xmath133 .",
    "such improvements come at a cost : under these weaker hypotheses one does not know anything like the explicit formulas appearing in proposition [ prop : eisenstein coeff ] and theorem [ thm : x degree ] .    instead",
    ", one should be able ( we have not checked the details ) to prove the main result by using the siegel - weil arguments of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in essence , the siegel - weil formula allows one to compare the point counting part of theorem [ thm : x degree ] with the values of certain whittaker functions appearing in the eisenstein series coefficients of proposition [ prop : eisenstein coeff ] , without deriving explicit formulas for either one .",
    "a rough outline of the contents is as follows :    in  [ s : shimura varieties ] we establish the basic properties of the shimura variety @xmath40 on which we will be performing intersection theory , and of the special cycles @xmath46 . we prove that the @xmath46 define cartier divisors on @xmath40 , and explore the functoriality of the formation of @xmath40 and its divisors with respect to the quadratic space @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , given an isometric embedding @xmath134 of maximal @xmath21-quadratic spaces of signatures @xmath135 and @xmath2 , with @xmath136 , we prove the existence of a canonical morphism @xmath137 between the associated integral models , and show that the pullback of a special divisor on @xmath40 is a prescribed linear combination of special divisors on @xmath138 .",
    "in  [ s : analysis ] we remind the reader of some of the analytic theory used in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we recall the essential properties of harmonic weak maass forms , the divisors @xmath139 on @xmath0 associated to such forms , and the green functions @xmath98 for these divisors , which are defined as regularized theta lifts .",
    "we also recall the theta series and convolution @xmath3-functions that appear in the main theorem , and schofer s @xcite calculation of the fourier coefficients of the eisenstein series of remark [ rem : eisenstein intro ] .",
    "the only thing new here is that , thanks to the constructions of  [ s : shimura varieties ] , we are able to define an extension of the divisor @xmath139 on @xmath0 to a divisor @xmath99 on the integral model @xmath40 .    in  [ s : cm section ]",
    "we fix a quadratic space @xmath140 over @xmath21 of signature @xmath141 , whose even clifford algebra is isomorphic to the maximal order in a quadratic imaginary field @xmath54 .",
    "the clifford algebra of @xmath140 then has the form @xmath142 .",
    "the shimura variety associated to the rank two torus @xmath143 has dimension  @xmath9 , and can be realized as the moduli stack of elliptic curves with complex multiplication by @xmath59 . using this interpretation we define an integral model @xmath144 , and define the kuga - satake abelian scheme as @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the universal cm elliptic curve .",
    "all of the results of  [ s : shimura varieties ] are then extended to this new setting .",
    "in particular , we define a family of divisors @xmath147 on the arithmetic curve @xmath64 , each of which can be characterized as the locus of points where @xmath148 has an extra quasi - endomorphism with prescribed properties .",
    "this can also be expressed in terms of endomorphisms of the universal cm elliptic curve : along each special divisor the action of @xmath59 on @xmath149 extends to an action of an order in a definite quaternion algebra .",
    "theorem [ thm : x degree ] gives explicit formulas for the degrees of the divisors @xmath147 , and these degrees match up with schofer s formulas for the coefficients of eisenstein series .",
    "many cases of theorem [ thm : x degree ] already appear in work of kudla - rapoport - yang @xcite and kudla - yang @xcite , and our proof , like theirs , makes essential use of gross s calculation @xcite of the endomorphism rings of canonical lifts of cm elliptic curves .",
    "in  [ s : main section ] we prove theorem [ bigthm : a ] .",
    "the greatest difficulty comes from the fact that the @xmath150-cycle @xmath64 on @xmath72 may have irreducible components contained entirely within @xmath151 .",
    "thus we must compute improper intersections .",
    "our techniques for doing this are a blend of the methods used in @xcite on unitary shimura varieties , and the methods of hu s thesis @xcite , which reconstructs the arithmetic intersection theory of gillet - soul @xcite using fulton s method of deformation to the normal cone .",
    "the cycle @xmath64 has a normal bundle @xmath152 , and the arithmetic divisor @xmath153 on @xmath40 has a _ specialization to the normal bundle _",
    "@xmath154 , which is an arithmetic divisor on @xmath155 .",
    "the specialization is defined in such a way that the arithmetic degree of @xmath153 along @xmath156 is equal to the arithmetic degree of @xmath154 along the zero section @xmath157 .",
    "what we are able to show , essentially , is that every component of the arithmetic divisor @xmath154 that meets the zero section improperly has @xmath158 , the specialization of the cotautological bundle , as its associated line bundle .",
    "this implies that every component of @xmath159 that meets @xmath64 improperly contributes the same quantity , @xmath160 $ ] , to the degree @xmath161 $ ] .",
    "the contribution to the intersection of the remaining components can be read off from the degrees of the divisors @xmath162 computed in  [ s : cm section ] , and the calculation of @xmath160 $ ] quickly reduces to the chowla - selberg formula .",
    "finally , we remark that the proof of theorem [ bigthm : a ] makes essential use of the bruinier - yang calculation ( following schofer @xcite ) of the values of @xmath98 at the points of @xmath163 .",
    "because of the particular way in which the divergent integral defining @xmath98 is regularized , the green function @xmath98 has a well - defined value even at points of divisor @xmath99 along which @xmath98 has a logarithmic singularity . in other words ,",
    "the green function comes , by construction , with a discontinuous extension to all points of @xmath164 .",
    "hu s thesis sheds some light on this phenomenon , and the _ over - regularized _ values of @xmath98 at the points of @xmath99 will play an essential role in our calculation of improper intersections .",
    "the authors thank jan bruinier , jos burgos gil , steve kudla , and tonghai yang for helpful conversations and insights .",
    "they also thank the referees for useful comments .",
    "let @xmath165 be a commutative ring .",
