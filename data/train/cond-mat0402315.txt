    "in the late 1990s , the researches on complex networks knew an explosive development @xcite .",
    "the impulse came from the convergence of interests between different sectors like physics , biology , technology and sociology turning the study of complex networks into a new interdisciplinary field .",
    "a network is a set of vertices or nodes provided with some rule to connect them by edges .",
    "with such a simple definition , it is not a surprise that it has found so much utility in so many areas . following the classification introduced by newman @xcite",
    ", one can divide real networks into four types : social , biological , technological and informational .",
    "social networks are composed by interacting people with some pattern of contacts like friendship , business or sexual partners .",
    "one of the most popular works in social webs was carried out by milgram @xcite who first arrived to the concept of `` six degrees of separation '' and small - world .",
    "social networks also include problems like the collaboration network of film actors @xcite or co - authorship among academics @xcite .",
    "a number of problems can be mapped into biological networks .",
    "some very good examples are : the 282-neuron neural network of the nematode _ c. elegans _",
    "@xcite , blood vessels and vascular networks @xcite , food webs in an ecosystem with species living in a prey - predator scheme @xcite , network of metabolic pathways @xcite and the genetic regulatory network for the expression of a gene @xcite .",
    "technological networks are those built by man in his arduous struggle for progress and welfare .",
    "perhaps , the best known example is the electric power grid ( high - voltage three - phase transmission lines network ) @xcite .",
    "this category also includes the networks of airline routes @xcite , railways @xcite and internet structures @xcite .",
    "the fourth type is the information network .",
    "one of the oldest example of this kind is the network of citations between academic papers @xcite .",
    "this network is certainly influenced by social relationships and it may be somehow contaminated since putting a citation in a paper does not mean that the author had actually read it @xcite .",
    "another important example is the world wide web , which is the network of informations between web pages @xcite .",
    "it is a directed network with different power laws for the in and out degree distributions .",
    "motivated by such a number of applications , a myriad of theoretical models were proposed aiming to reproduce or to describe real - world networks . in many of these models ,",
    "the degree distribution is power law and the corresponding network is said scale - free @xcite .",
    "a good number of real - world networks are of this kind .",
    "one widely studied scale - free network is the linear barabsi - albert model ( ba ) @xcite . in its general form ,",
    "that we call the nonlinear barabsi - albert model ( nba ) , the network is constructed as follows .",
    "a new vertex connects to another ( already existing ) vertex @xmath14 with probability @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the degree , i. e. , the number of edges connected to the vertex @xmath14 and @xmath2 is a real number .",
    "each new vertex adds @xmath3 new edges to the network . in the linear case ( @xmath10 )",
    ", the model has many desired characteristics like to be a scale - free network or to have the small - world effect , but it also has some other features which are not so coveted : it is no assortative and the clustering goes to zero with the increasing size of the network .",
    "a network is said assortative if it connects preferentially nodes with almost the same degree .",
    "it is something like a social stratification by the incomes .",
    "if we think of social networks , assortative mixing and clustering are both yearned qualities @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the nba ( the model , not the basketball association ) by determining some important quantities like the degree distribution , the clustering coefficient @xmath17 , the assortativity coefficient @xmath8 and the average shortest path length @xmath18 .",
    "this is done in the whole space of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we obtain some interesting analytical as well as numerical results . writing the master equation for the number of vertices with degree @xmath0",
    ", we derive an expression for the degree distribution @xmath4 . if @xmath7 , the gel phase has @xmath3 super- connected sites . for @xmath6 the nba becomes a homogeneous lattice with all sites having connectivity @xmath19 . through a simple change of stochastic variables , we rederive",
    "the known stretched exponential form of @xmath4 in the mean field approximation .",
    "it is proposed a formula for the clustering coefficient which was verified by numerical simulations .",
    "the behavior of the assortativity coefficient is numerically evaluated .",
    "the nba is assortative ( disassortative ) if @xmath9 ( @xmath7 ) and no assortative only when @xmath10 . in the limit @xmath20",
    ", the assortativity coefficient can be calculated exactly .",
    "we find @xmath11 when @xmath12 . by numerical simulations ,",
    "the minimum average shortest path length @xmath13 is determined . as the size of the network increases",
    ", @xmath13 diverges if @xmath5 and it is equal to @xmath21 otherwise .",
    "the probability @xmath4 that a randomly chosen vertex has degree @xmath0 was obtained in references @xcite for the case @xmath22 . here",
    "we derive this probability for any value of @xmath3 . for a network with @xmath23 vertices ,",

    "for the @xmath3 possibilities , this happens with probability @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the last term accounts for the continuous introduction of new vertices .",

    "the new vertex connects to those poorest vertices in a say socialistic way . if @xmath43 with @xmath44 and assuming the connectivity @xmath0 to be a continuous variable , the degree distribution exhibits a maximum at @xmath45^{\\frac{1}{\\|\\alpha\\|}}$ ] .",
    "the degree distribution expanded around this maximum has the gaussian form    @xmath46    in the limit @xmath47 it approaches the dirac delta function @xmath48 .",
    "the condition @xmath49 fixes @xmath50 .",
    "the network is now homogeneous with all vertices having connectivity @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath22 , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath31 is @xmath51 @xcite and there arise one super - connected node to which almost every other vertex is connected .",
    "when @xmath52 , we found @xmath3 super - connected nodes .",
    "this result was confirmed exhaustively by our numerical simulations . for large enough networks ,",
    "the degree histogram always shows ( with no exceptions ) @xmath3 super - connected nodes . the probability _ b _ that the @xmath3 initial vertices are connected to all other remaining sites of the network can be calculated . in the discrete time version process ,",

    "the clustering coefficient is a transitivity property of the network .",
    "if a vertex @xmath21 is connected with vertex @xmath77 and the vertex @xmath77 with the vertex @xmath78 then there is a high probability that the vertex @xmath21 is also connected to @xmath78 . in social networks , this can be easily interpreted as the fact that the friend of your friend is likely to be your friend .",

    "the latter form is more consistent with the numerical simulations results than an earlier theoretical prediction ( @xmath104 @xcite ) .",
    "we simulate the nonlinear nba model in networks with sizes varying from @xmath105 up to @xmath106 and @xmath12 . for each size , the average clustering coefficient was determined and then average it over @xmath107 to @xmath108 independent runs . in the fig.1 , we plot the dependence of @xmath17 with @xmath2 for two network sizes @xmath106 and @xmath109 .     for two different network sizes @xmath23.,width=302 ]    in the figure 2 , we compare the results of the analytical expression ( eq.(16 ) ) with those of the simulated nba model .    for @xmath7 , the clustering coefficient rapidly approaches the value @xmath21 as we increase the size @xmath23 .",
    "this result comes from the fact that the @xmath3 super - connected nodes are also inter - connected .",
    "thus , when a new vertex is added to the network , the strong preferential dynamics ( alpha > 1 ) forces it to connect with the @xmath3 super - connected nodes , leading to a clustering coefficient value close to one .",
    "one important aspect of the networks is how the vertices are linked . if there is a tendency to connect vertices with almost the same degree , we call it an assortative mixing .",
