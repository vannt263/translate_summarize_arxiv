    "+ in more details , even though different strategies are possible , we decided to select @xmath355 as the following partial sum of the fourier - legendre series of @xmath4 @xmath356 which converges in uniform norm versus @xmath4 as @xmath352 increases if @xmath4 is analytic on the bernstein ellipse .",
    "one motivation that lead us to consider this approach is that @xmath4 and @xmath355 have the same mean value ( see ( [ lamasq ] ) and the third example in section  [ example ] ) .",
    "it must be said , in fact , that all our experiments suggest that the upper bound established in proposition  [ pcond ] may be not sharp if @xmath357 @xmath68 is sufficiently large and @xmath358 finally , we observe that we can approximate @xmath359 by applying a standard gaussian quadrature formula or , for example , the algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the described method has been implemented in ` matlab ` ( version ` r2015b ` ) and the generalized matrix eigenvalue problem ( [ genmat ] ) has been solved by using the ` eig ` or the ` eigs ` ( with option ` sm ` ) commands depending on the number of eigenvalues we were interested in .",
    "for the approximation of the coefficients @xmath360 in ( [ ql ] ) we have applied the standard gaussian quadrature formula with degree of precision @xmath361 ( the function ` legpts ` included in ` chebfun v4.3.2987 ` has been used for the computation of its nodes and weights ) . concerning the choice of @xmath351 we always select it in such a way that @xmath362 is of the order of the machine precision . for the estimate of the error in the approximation of @xmath29 we consider as `` exact '' the corresponding numerical eigenvalue obtained with matrices of size @xmath363 with @xmath364 in fact , it is important to underline the fact that if @xmath365 then the exact eigenvalues are not known in closed form even for @xmath4 identically zero in @xmath366 and that , differently with respect to classical sturm - liouville problems , nowadays it is not yet available a well - established numerical software for the solution of the eigenvalue problem we have studied in this paper . + as first examples , we solved the problems with @xmath367 and @xmath368 for several values of @xmath8 and @xmath82 clearly , see ( [ ql ] ) , for the first potential we set @xmath369 while for the second one we choose @xmath370 in figures  [ figpoli],[figexp ] , the errors in the resulting approximation of the eigenvalues have been reported with , as we are going to do for all examples , a logarithmic scale on the abscissae .",
    "as one can see , in both cases , as soon as @xmath68 is sufficiently larger than the index of the eigenvalue @xmath298 it results @xmath371 estimates of the various values of @xmath372 determined with a least - square approximation , are listed in table  [ taborder ] .",
    "it is evident that @xmath373 in agreement with theorem  [ teoconv ] .",

    "all these arguments lead to the value of @xmath384 previously specified . as an example , in figure  [ figtrig ] we report the errors in the eigenvalue approximations versus the index for @xmath385 and for four values of @xmath386 in addition , we list estimates of the corresponding @xmath384 s determined with a least - square fitting .",
