    "@xcite in the last decades interest in the systems with two ops has increased drastically in connection with the discovery of high-@xmath17 superconductors ( see , e.g. ,  ) .",
    "very recently , it has been experimentally established that , in cuprates , the superconducting op  @xmath18 coexists with a state with a charge modulation ( see recent papers refs .   and references therein ) .    in another class of recently discovered superconductors  the so - called fe - based pnictides ",
    "superconductivity may coexist with a spin density wave  ( sdw ) ( for a review see refs .  ) .",
    "coexistence of ops of different types results in several interesting phenomena .",
    "one can mention the enhancement of the london penetration depth@xcite or a peak in the specific heat jump@xcite at the doping level at which the sdw is formed , the peculiar dynamics of the ops  ( see recent papers refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "nonhomogeneous states in systems with two ops are also very interesting and unusual . for example , a cdw arises in the center of vortices in cuprates.@xcite nonhomogeneous states in superconductors may arise even in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "for example , fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov  ( fflo ) states may appear in superconductors in the presence of an exchange field@xcite and the so called amplitude solitons can be energetically favorable in conductors with cdw or sdw .",
    "the latter have been predicted in refs .   and observed in ref .   in systems with a single op  in quasi - one - dimensional conductors with a cdw .",
    "amplitude solitons in systems with a cdw mean that the amplitude  @xmath7 of the cdw drops to zero at some point , and a local energy level  @xmath19 arises in the system.@xcite for example , if @xmath20 , the phase  @xmath21 of  @xmath1 changes from @xmath22 at @xmath23 to @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "the energy level  @xmath19 may vary in time when a sufficiently high current passes through the system . in this case , the stationary state is unstable and one deals with a dynamical amplitude soliton with  @xmath26.@xcite another case of a non - stationary ( moving ) soliton was studied in a recent work.@xcite in both cases , the structure of the amplitude soliton can be found analytically from a solution of microscopic equations.@xcite it is relevant to mention the stripes in high-@xmath17 superconductors@xcite that are higher dimensional relatives of the solutions of refs .  .",
    "fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov states in superconductors coexisting with other ops , such as cdw or sdw , were studied recently in several works.@xcite in particular , it has been pointed out in ref .   that the states similar to the  fflo state are possible in superconductors competing with cdw or sdw .",
    "note that another type of nonhomogeneous states in systems with two ops has been studied in refs .",
    "using the so - called brazoskii - type model.@xcite in particular , it has been shown that a `` glassy '' phase may arise in these systems .    however , the fflo - like state may arise , e.g. , in fe - based pnictides , only at low enough temperatures  @xmath27 when the dependence of  @xmath1 on the curvature  @xmath4 is a multivalued function@xcite which is in a full analogy with superconductors with an exchange field  @xmath28 .",
    "in the latter case , the dependence  @xmath29 at low  @xmath27 is a multivalued function in a certain interval of  @xmath28.@xcite spatial dependence of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 can be described by a generalized eilenberger equation complemented by self - consistency relations@xcite but their analytical study is not simple .    in this paper , we analyze nonuniform states of the ops on the basis of the ginzburg  landau equations that are considerably more transparent than the eilenberger equation .",

    "this means that we consider a situation when the superconducting op  @xmath0 changes its phase from  @xmath2 to  @xmath3 across this defect , while the amplitude of the cdw ( or sdw )  @xmath7 is localized at the center of the defect decaying to zero away from this point .",
    "of course , the opposite situation is also possible , i.e. , when the function  @xmath7 changes sign having opposite values at  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 and  @xmath10 is a localized function .    using a system of coupled ginzburg ",
    "landau equations we show that , while the superconducting op may vary in space as @xmath33 , the form of the amplitude  @xmath7 depends on temperature or doping .",
    "it is described by the gross  pitaevskii equation resulting in a peculiar quantization of the solutions for  @xmath7 .",
    "the function  @xmath34 corresponding to the ground state has the form of a soliton whereas the functions  @xmath9 corresponding to excited states have nodes .    in the opposite case , when a solution @xmath35 is brought about , the superconducting op  @xmath0 is localized near the point  @xmath36 and changes its form with variation of temperature in a rather unusual way .    the nonuniform states considered in this paper may arise in the bulk , near the surface or in heterostructures consisting of materials with two ops . in the latter cases such states appear necessarily because of boundary or matching conditions imposed on the ops . note that the interesting and novel phenomena arising at the surface or in heterostructures are already known .",
    "a new type of superconductivity ( triplet odd - frequency ) in superconductor / ferromagnet bilayer in the ferromagnet@xcite and the appearance of bound edge states with possible formation of majorana fermions at the surface of superconductors@xcite are remarkable examples of these phenomena .",
