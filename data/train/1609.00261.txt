    "<S> at low temperature , information can be stored in a bit encoded in the state of an adatom whenever its two lowest eigenstates have finite and opposite sign of the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> however , scattering of electrons and phonons with the nanomagnet leads its states to have incoherent classical dynamics and might cause fast loss of the encoded information .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been understood that such scattering obeys certain selection rules due to the symmetries of the system . by analyzing the point - group symmetry of the surface , the time - reversal symmetry and the magnitude of the adatom effective spin </S>",
    "<S> , we identify which nanomagnets configurations are to be avoided and which are promising to encode a stable bit . to make contact with the experiments , numerical simulations have been performed to show how such stable configurations respond to typical scanning tunneling microscopy measurements . finally , we generalize our result to rather arbitrary bipartite cluster configurations where adatoms are coupled through a heisenberg - like interactions . </S>"
