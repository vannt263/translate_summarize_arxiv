    "a new generation of deep , large - area , synoptic ( repeated - scan ) galaxy surveys is coming online and is poised to revolutionize cosmology in particular and astrophysics in general .",
    "the scanning nature of these surveys will open the way for a systematic study of the celestial sphere in the time domain .",
    "in particular , ongoing and planned surveys are sensitive to the transient cosmos on timescales from hours to years , and to supernova flux limits down to @xmath3 and sometimes fainter .",
    "as we will see , these capabilities will reap a huge harvest in cosmic supernovae and will offer a new and direct probe of the cosmic supernova history out to high redshifts .    in the past decade , supernovae in nearby and distant galaxies have come to play crucial role for cosmology , via the use of type ia explosions as `` standardizable '' candles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these powerful beacons are detectable out to very high redshift and thus reveal the cosmic expansion history for much of the lifetime of the universe ; the stunning result has been the detection of the acceleration of the universe and the inference that dark energy of some form dominates the mass - energy content of the cosmos today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of large numbers of type ia supernovae over a large redshift range , and their use as cosmological probes , represents a major focus of future galaxy surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while studies of supernova type ia ( thermonuclear explosions ) justly receive enormous attention due to their cosmological importance , there has been relatively little focus on the detection of the more numerous population of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "these explosions of massive stars show great diversity in their observed properties , e.g.  including several varieties of type ii events , but also types ib and ic events . despite their heterogeneous nature",
    ", some core - collapse events may nonetheless provide standardized candles , via their early lightcurves whose nature is set by the physics of their expanding photospheres ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see below ) . moreover , core - collapse events are of great intrinsic importance for cosmology , astrophysics , and particle physics .",
    "these events play a crucial role in cosmic energy feedback processes and thus in the formation and evolution of galaxies and of cosmological structure .",
    "synoptic surveys tuned for type ia events will also automatically detect core - collapse supernovae . indeed , as survey coverage and depth increase , they will , for the first time , image a large fraction of _ all _ unobscured cosmic core - collapse supernovae out to moderate redshift .",
    "these photometric detections of supernovae and their light curves will shed new light on a wide variety of problems spanning cosmology , particle astrophysics , and supernova studies .",
    "moreover , these data will `` come for free '' so long as surveys include core - collapse events in their analysis pipelines .",
    "for example , @xcite already pointed out the link between the cosmic star formation history and the cosmic supernova history , and showed that when integrated over all redshifts , the all - sky supernova event rate is enormous , @xmath4 events / sec in their estimate .",
    "upcoming synoptic surveys will probe most or all of the sky at great depth , and thus are positioned to observe a large fraction of these events .",
    "consequently , these surveys will reveal the history of cosmic supernovae via directly _ counting _ their numbers as a function of redshift .",
    "already , recent and ongoing surveys have begun to detect core - collapse supernovae . however , to date , surveys have focused on type ia events , and thus core - collapse discovery and observation has been a serendipitous or even accidental byproduct of snia searches . as a result of these surveys ,",
    "the supernova discovery rate is accelerating , and the current all - time , all - type supernova count is @xmath5 since sn1006 .",
    "thus core - collapse data is currently sparsely analyzed and reported in an uneven manner .",
    "this situation will drastically improve in the near future , when the supernova count increase by large factors , culminating in up to @xmath6 100,000 core - collapse events seen by lsst annually . in this paper",
    "we therefore will anticipate this future , rather than make extensive comparison with the present data though we will make quantitative contact with current results .",
    "our work draws upon several key analyses .",
    "the thorough and elegant work of @xcite laid out the framework for rates and observability of cosmic supernovae of all types .",
    "their work assembled a large body of supernova data and applied it to make rate and discovery predictions for the wide variety of star formation histories and normalizations viable at that time , with a particular focus on forecasts for very high redshift ( out to @xmath7 ) observable by the infrared _ james webb space telescope_. @xcite estimated the rates for supernovae lensed by the matter distribution  particularly rich clusters ",
    "along the line of sight ; these objects further extend the reach of infrared searches , and identified a possible supernova candidate from _",
    "hubble space telescope",
    "_ archival images of an intermediate - redshift cluster .",
    "@xcite made similar calculations of the infrared observability of supernovae , and identified additional events in archival data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented forecasts for then - upcoming ground - based surveys .",
    "these studies considered all cosmic supernovae , but with a focus on type ia events , specifically with an eye towards revealing the type ia delay time as well as a parameterized characterization of the cosmic star formation history based on type ia counts .",
    "in addition , these first studies reasonably chose to emphasize near - term ( i.e. , now - completed or ongoing ) relatively modest surveys , or on future space - based missions such as snap , with little to no study of the impact of large synoptic surveys .",
    "moreover , while these works included dust extinction effects in host galaxies , but because of their focus on type ia events , they did not study the possibility of a redshift evolution in extinction @xcite .",
    "we build on the important studies of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in several respects : ( 1 ) we explore the promise of synoptic surveys and forecast the very large numbers of supernovae they will find ; ( 2 ) we focus on less - studied core - collapse events ; ( 3 ) we incorporate the ( pessimistic ) possibility of strong dust evolution of @xcite which is a dominant obstacle to observing massive star death at high redshifts ; ( 4 ) we present a strategy for _ empirically _ calibrating the obscuration properties across a broad range of redshift by studying the evolution of the supernova luminosity function ; and ( 5 ) we study the unique opportunities that become available with the large supernova harvest of synoptic surveys ; in particular , we show how the cosmic supernova rate can be recovered based on core - collapse counts , without assumption as to its functional form .",
    "our goal in this paper is to explore the impact synopic surveys will make on core - collapse supernova astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "we summarize key upcoming surveys in  [ sect : surveys ] . in  [",
    "sect : inputs ] we review expectations for the csnr , core - collapse supernova observables , and the effect of cosmic dust and its evolution .",
    "we combine these inputs in  [ sect : forecasts ] where we forecast the core - collapse supernova discovery potential for upcoming surveys .",
    "we quantify in detail the strong dependence of the supernova harvest on the survey limiting magnitude , which we find to be the key figure of merit for supernova studies .",
    "we discuss some of the supernova science payoff in ",
    "[ sect : discuss ] , and conclude in  [ sect : conclude ] with some recommendations for synoptic surveys .",
    "current and future sky surveys build on the pioneering approach of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . following sdss",
    ", these surveys will produce high - quality digital photometric maps of large regions of the celestial sphere . the powerful innovation the new surveys to extend the original sdss approach into the time domain .",
    "each program will scan part of their survey domain frequently , with revisit periods of days and in some cases even hours , and maintain this systematic effort throughout the survey s multi - year operating lifespans",
    ". the result will be unprecedented catalogs of transient phenomena over timescales from hours to years .",
    "these surveys are thus ideal for supernova discovery and matched to supernova light curve evolution timescales ; the result will be a revolution in our observational understanding of supernovae .",
    ".[tab : vitalstats ] recent and future synoptic sky surveys [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figures [ fig : sdss][fig : lsst ] show the supernova forecasts for different surveys . for each",
    "we show the expected annual supernova harvest @xmath8 as a function of redshift , with the sky coverage held fixed to the values in table [ tab : vitalstats ] .",
    "the count distribution across redshift bins are directly proportional to the differential supernova rate distribution @xmath9 , via eq .  .",
    "thus the shapes the curves follow those of @xmath9 as seen in figure [ fig : dndodtdz_band ] an explained in the accompanying discussion .",
    "figures [ fig : sdss][fig : lsst ] also show the survey scan time required for these data to constrain the cosmic star - formation rate in each redshift bin to within a statistical precision @xmath10 .",
    "we have seen ( eq .  [ eq : csnr - sig ] ) that the precision at each bin is inverse with the counts , @xmath11 .",
    "thus these panels show trends in which monitoring time decreases with the counts per bin .",
    "this mirrors the behavior shown in figure [ fig : dtdomega_r ] and explained in the surrounding discussion .",
    "table [ tab : redshift - r ] shows the effect of survey limiting magnitude on redshift range and total supernova harvest in the @xmath12-band .",
    "we see that each unit increase @xmath13 in survey depth yields a large enhancement , in the total supernovae seen .",
    "the supernova numbers increase by a factor 4.3 when going from @xmath14 to @xmath15 to factor of 2.0 when going from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "of course , there is a tradeoff in the needed exposure . for the faintest objects at the highest redshifts , background noise dominates , and monitoring time grows by a factor @xmath18 per magnitude .",
    "thus , including a narrower but deeper survey mode will likely yield fewer supernovae , but if judiciously implemented , this tradeoff may be worth the additional redshift coverage .",
    "-correction of the four types of supernovae(i - bc , ii - l , ii - p , ii - n ) in @xmath20 and @xmath12 bands ( green lines for @xmath20-band and red lines for @xmath12-band ) .",
    "the sharp upturn in the ibc correction reflects a cutoff in the supernova spectrum due to uv line blanketing ; see discussion in text .",
    "[ fig : kcorrection ] , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the @xmath19-correction accounts for redshifting of the supernova spectrum across the passbands in the observer frame . in the context of the southern intermediate redshift eso supernova search ,",
    "the elegant and instructive analysis of @xcite determine @xmath19-corrections for the @xmath21 supernova confirmed and candidate events in their survey .",
    "they found that the corrections depend strongly on redshift , light curve phase , and on waveband .",
    "in particular , the shifts from observed @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands to rest - frame @xmath24-band both typically have @xmath25 , i.e , a negative correction , particularly at early times most relevant here ; this reflects the blue colors of the early phases .",
    "the corrections are at early times ( within the first three weeks ) usually a shift @xmath26 , with the largest corrections @xmath27 . as seen in eq .",
    ", a negative correction would reduce the apparent magnitude and thus _ improve _ the observability of the supernovae .    in this paper",
    "we compute @xmath19-corrections following the formalism of @xcite in a single band , and add the color correction term ( which described as @xmath28 in section [ sect : snmlim ] ) to make the corresponding correction when transfer from one band to another . in band @xmath29 , the @xmath19-correction is k_x = 2.5 ( 1+z )  +   2.5 where @xmath30 is the unobscured , rest - frame spectral distribution of the supernova , and @xmath31 is the sensitivity of filter @xmath29 .",
    "we included five types of core collapse supernovae : ib , ic , ii - l , ii - p , iin .",
    "for each spectral type , we adopt a rest - frame spectrum @xmath30 following the prescription of @xcite , who adopt blackbody spectra ( sometimes slightly modified ) with different temperatures and time evolution .",
    "we picked the temperatures which last for about a weak around the peak luminosity and treat them as a constant . since the surveys we are interested in will have cadence less than a week",
    ", this should be a reasonable simplification . for type ib and ic ,",
    "we choose a 15,000 k blackbody with cutoff at @xmath32 because of uv blanketing .",
    "we choose 11,000 k for type",
    "ii - l , 10 , 000 k for type ii - p , and 14,000 k for type iin .",
    "our resulting @xmath19-correction appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : kcorrection ] , plotted for the @xmath20 and @xmath12 bands which we will see are the optimal for supernova discovery .",
    "the huge turnoff of the @xmath19-correction in type i - bc is due to the short - wavelength cutoff in its spectrum .",
    "a large value is set so that there will be no type i - bc supernovae observed beyond the cutoff point .",
    "regardless of the turnoff of type i - bc , for low redshifts the @xmath19-correction is in the range of @xmath33 to @xmath34 but typically is negative , which is in consistent with @xcite ."
