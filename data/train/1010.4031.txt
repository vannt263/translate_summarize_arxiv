    "supersymmetric solutions of the common sector of supergravity theories in ten dimensions have attracted the attention of both the hep - th and math.dg communities . in particular , in six real dimensions these have become known as _ non - khler _ geometries .",
    "they are one of the simplest examples of geometries characterized by a @xmath2-structure , which arise naturally in supergravity theories @xcite . from the differential geometry point of view",
    ", the interest comes from the fact that the relevant @xmath3 structure is a relatively simple modification of @xmath3 holonomy , the latter characterizing calabi - yau three - folds .",
    "essentially one replaces the levi - civita connection by a connection with skew - symmetic torsion .",
    "the manifolds are then still complex , but not symplectic , hence in particular they are not khler manifolds @xcite . these structures are , however , quite rich ; for example , they are relevant for studies of mirror symmetry @xcite and conifold transitions @xcite",
    ". other work on heterotic non - khler geometries includes , for example , @xcite .",
    "this is also the appropriate framework for studying supersymmetric configurations of five - branes , and hence it features in the gauge / gravity duality .",
    "most notably , a non - khler solution related to @xmath4 sym theory was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that there are also generalizations of the non - khler equations to other dimensions .",
    "for example , in seven and eight dimensions the geometries are characterized by torsion - full @xmath5 and @xmath6 structures , respectively @xcite .",
    "most of our results apply also to these cases .    in the context of heterotic or type i string theory ,",
    "there is also a non - abelian @xmath7 or @xmath8 gauge field @xmath9 . in the latter case ,",
    "the non - abelian gauge field plays a crucial role in constructions of string theory vacua that are designed to reproduce semi - realistic four - dimensional particle physics @xcite .",
    "vacua in which the internal field strength has a background expectation value transforming in a subgroup @xmath2 of one of the @xmath10 factors give as four - dimensional gauge group the commutant of @xmath2 in @xmath10 . in the simplest construction , known as the standard embedding",
    ", one identifies the internal gauge field with the @xmath3 spin connection of a background calabi - yau metric , giving @xmath11 as the observed gauge group .",
    "in the first part of this paper we will mainly focus on a @xmath0 gauge field inside the common abelian subgroup @xmath12 of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; we shall then later discuss how to incorporate non - abelian gauge fields that may lead to four - dimensional gauge groups @xmath13 and @xmath14 , using a modified form of the standard embedding .",
    "the mathematical understanding of non - khler geometries is much less developed than that of calabi - yau manifolds . despite the very impressive existence results obtained recently in @xcite , it is still desirable to construct new explicit examples .",
    "the reformulation of the supersymmetry conditions in terms of equations for an @xmath3 structure @xcite is in fact not particularly helpful for this task , as one might have hoped . to make progress",
    ", the standard approach is that of making an _ ansatz _ for the metric ( or @xmath2-structure ) enjoying additional symmetries . in this paper",
    "we will explore a different method for constructing new solutions , namely a _ solution - generating _ transformation .",
    "generally , these transformations exploit the symmetries of supergravity theories , and here we will discuss how such methods can be adapted to study solutions to the non - khler equations , and their cousins in dimensions @xmath15 .",
    "buscher t - duality is at the heart of most of the generating techniques in supegravity .",
    "a simple transformation involving t - duality is the so - called tst transformation .",
    "this has been applied to a variety of backgrounds , producing interesting gravity duals .",
    "the basic idea is that this transformation induces a @xmath16-field on the two - torus on which it is performed , hence giving a non - commutative deformation @xcite .",
    "examples include the gravity duals of non - commutative field theories @xcite , the beta - deformations @xcite , dipole deformations @xcite , and non - relativistic ( schrdinger ) deformations @xcite .",
    "essentially the same transformation ( see appendix [ trtappendix ] ) was used earlier to construct configurations of d - brane bound states @xcite . for a concise review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the tst transformation is part of the @xmath17 t - duality group transformation . ] of type ii supergravities @xcite . in the heterotic theory the generalized t - duality group",
    "is enlarged to @xmath18 , where 16 is the dimension of the cartan subgroup of the gauge group @xcite .",
    "transformations with elements of this group have been employed in the literature to construct ( non - supersymmetric ) charged black holes , starting from uncharged black holes @xcite .",
    "the solution - generating method that we will discuss in this paper , in the context of heterotic supergravity , involves a particular subgroup @xmath19 of the @xmath18 group .",
    "however , instead of using the @xmath18 transformation rules , we will derive the transformation from a rather different point of view , which is analogous to the tst transformation .",
    "starting from a heterotic solution with a @xmath0 symmetry , which includes calabi - yau manifolds with a @xmath0 isometry as a special case , essentially the transformation that we will employ consists of a rotation of the coordinates on an auxiliary two - torus , followed by an ordinary buscher t - duality ( not involving the gauge fields ) , and then an opposite rotation .",
    "we will refer to this as an rtr transformation .",
    "a more detailed description will be given shortly .",
    "in particular , we will show that this transformation _ preserves supersymmetry _ of the heterotic theory , hence in particular it preserves the non - khler equations .    in the process",
    "we will also show that this procedure may be phrased entirely in terms of a simple @xmath17 transformation in type ii .",
    "in fact , we will see that physically the solution - generating method , once embedded into type ii , is essentially equivalent to a tst transformation .",
    "this can be applied also to backgrounds which are non - khler to begin with .",
    "for example , one can apply it to gravity duals of field theories @xcite . in this case",
    "our formulas then give the supergravity duals of certain dipole deformations , that we briefly discuss at the end of the paper .    for applications to heterotic string theory ,",
    "the expansion in powers of @xmath1 becomes important .",
    "in particular , the bianchi identity and equations of motion receive corrections which involve the _ gravitational _ chern - simons terms and the full _ non - abelian _ heterotic gauge field , already at first order .",
    "however , the transformation that we will discuss does not act naturally on these terms .",
    "we will nevertheless explain how to restore @xmath1 in our transformation , and combine this with a certain `` modified standard embedding '' , in order to obtain full solutions to first order in @xmath1 , including a non - trivial non - abelian gauge field .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ heteroticsection ]",
    "we summarize and review heterotic supergravity . in section [ generating ]",
    "we discuss our solution - generating method and present general formulas for the transformation .",

    "we begin by reviewing the low - energy limit of heterotic string theory .",
    "this is a heterotic supergravity theory with an @xmath1 expansion , where @xmath20 is the heterotic string tension .",
    "the reader might think that this is rather standard material .",
    "although this should be the case , unfortunately there are many misunderstandings in the literature .",

    "there is no such representation for the @xmath8 string , and in general one should replace the particular traces that follow by @xmath25 of the trace in the adjoint representation . alternatively , this is equal to the trace in the fundamental representation when restricted to the @xmath26 subgroup of @xmath8  see , for example , @xcite .",

    "the deformation is like the beta deformation of maldacena - lunin @xcite , in that the parameter @xmath131 may be varied continuously to give a smoothly connected one - parameter family of supergravity solutions .",
    "we then discuss the more general rotation of section [ generalrotate ] . as for the beta deformation of @xcite",
    "a general global anaylsis is more complicated , and we restrict ourselves here only to some brief comments on global issues in this more general setting .",
    "we begin with ( [ wcoords ] ) , which is valid for @xmath128 . consider first the locus of points @xmath132 in the original spacetime @xmath133 where @xmath82 is non - zero . since we assumed that @xmath82 generates a @xmath0 isometry , it follows that @xmath134 will fibre over some orbifold @xmath135 .",
    "the one - form @xmath136 is then a connection one - form on the corresponding @xmath0 principal ( orbi-)bundle .",
    "notice that on @xmath134 the function @xmath28 is finite and strictly positive , and from ( [ hcycase ] ) the same is true of @xmath126 , and thus also of @xmath137 .",
    "since the one - form @xmath138 also appears in the rotated metric in ( [ wcoords ] ) , it follows that the corresponding locus @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is non - zero in the rotated spacetime @xmath141 , is diffeomorphic to @xmath134 , and that the rotated metric is regular on @xmath142 provided one takes the period of @xmath143 to be the _ same _ as the period of @xmath87 .",
    "the rotation then simply rescales the size of the @xmath0 fibre .",
    "let us now look at the locus of points where @xmath82 vanishes .",
    "take some connected component @xmath144 . by definition ,",
    "@xmath28 will diverge along @xmath145  the way in which it diverges is crucial for the regularity of the metric in a neighbourhood of @xmath145 .",
    "essentially , the metric restricted to the normal directions to @xmath145 should approach the flat space metric in some polar coordinate system .",
    "it turns out we will not need to enter into the precise details of this metric regularity condition . to see this , notice that near to @xmath145 we have to leading order @xmath146 , and @xmath147 . thus near to @xmath145",
    "the rotated metric is to leading order  & & ( w+a)^2 + vg _  .",
    "this is _ identical _ to the initial metric , with @xmath87 replaced by the new coordinate @xmath143 ( which forms the diffeomorphism of @xmath134 onto @xmath148 ) .",
    "since these have the same period , and since the metrics are the same to leading order near to @xmath145 , it follows that the rotated metric will be regular at @xmath145 provided the initial metric is .",
    "in fact an alternative way to argue this is to note quite generally that g & = & g - ( w + a)^2  . then where @xmath149 we have to leading order g & & g - ( w + a)^2  .",
    "the second term is a global one - form on @xmath141 , as discussed in more detail below , and hence the rotated metric is regular at these loci .",
    "also notice that since @xmath150 , and @xmath126 is smooth and nowhere zero , the rotated dilaton is smooth .    we conclude that for all @xmath151 the underlying manifold is the same , @xmath152 , and the rotated metric is smooth provided the initial metric was .",
    "notice that , in general , this is not true for the t - duality limit @xmath127 .",
    "for example , a codimension four fixed point set @xmath145 of @xmath82 becomes a five - brane in the t - dual solution . in this limit @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "in particular , along @xmath145 the dilaton @xmath155 diverges to infinity , as expected for a five - brane supergravity solution .",
    "of course , in this case the t - dual solution has no gauge field : @xmath156 .",
    "let us now turn to the rotated curvatures in ( [ curvatures ] ) .",
    "first note that @xmath138 is a global smooth one - form on @xmath157 .",
    "the one - form @xmath158 is then a global smooth one - form on the whole spacetime @xmath152 , since @xmath159 smoothly tends to zero precisely along the loci where @xmath140 vanishes .",
    "more precisely , @xmath159 vanishes as @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the distance to @xmath145 , while @xmath138 approaches a global one - form on the normal sphere bundle to @xmath145 in @xmath115 .",
    "thus @xmath162 is actually an _ exact _ two - form .",
    "there is hence no quantized flux associated to the rotated gauge field , as one might expect given that @xmath131 may be turned on continuously .",
    "similar comments apply also to @xmath163 , showing that it is a smooth global three - form on @xmath141 . notice that in the t - dual limit at @xmath127 , the change in the global structure of the spacetime due to a five - brane would then similarly be accompanied by a delta function source in the bianchi identity for @xmath164 .",
    "this completes our discussion of the global regularity of the solutions in section [ cycase ] .",
    "we conclude this section by commenting briefly on the more general rotations in ( [ rotation ] ) .",
    "again , for @xmath128 one can replace @xmath165 , and similar analysis shows that the new connection one - form on @xmath148 is now ( see ( [ changeoneforms ] ) ) w + a + -^2 c  .",
    "the ( orbi)-bundle @xmath166 will then have the same topology as @xmath167 , for all values of @xmath151 , only if @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( equivalently @xmath85 ) are _ global _ one - forms on @xmath135 . _ a priori _ , this need not be the case .",
    "one can similarly analyse the metric near to @xmath145 . in this case",
    "the rotated metric is to leading order [ smoothly ] g & & ( w + a + 2_)^2 + vg _  .",
    "crucial here is that , as well as @xmath170 going to zero along @xmath145 , one also has that @xmath83 and @xmath85 tend to zero along @xmath145 .",
    "this is because near to @xmath145 the coordinate @xmath87 is an angular coordinate on the sphere linking @xmath145 in @xmath133 , so that @xmath171 is in fact singular at @xmath145 .",
    "it follows that the coefficient of @xmath171 in any smooth form must go to zero along @xmath145 , at an appropriate rate .",
    "the above formula ( [ smoothly ] ) then guarantees that the rotated metric is smooth at @xmath145 if the initial metric is .",
    "as first derived in @xcite , a supersymmetric heterotic supergravity solution of the poincar - invariant form @xmath172 implies that the six - manifold @xmath173 has a canonical @xmath3 structure , satisfying the system of equations [ omegaeqn ] ( ^-2)&=&0  , + [ omegaeqn ] ( ^-2)&=&0  , + [ hflux ] ( |-)&=&h  . here",
    "@xmath174 and @xmath175 are the @xmath3-invariant real two - form and complex three - form , respectively .",
    "in particular , equation ( [ omegaeqn ] ) implies that the associated almost complex structure is integrable , so that @xmath173 is a complex manifold with zero first chern class .",
    "the @xmath176 and @xmath177 operators in ( [ hflux ] ) are then the usual dolbeault operators . on the other hand , in general @xmath174 is not closed and hence @xmath173 is not a khler manifold .",
    "such structures are now commonly referred to as _ non - khler geometries _ , even though this nomenclature is somewhat vague .",
    "we note that very similar results hold for products of minkowski space with complex @xmath178-folds , and also for other @xmath2 structures , such as @xmath5-structure manifolds @xcite .",
    "our analysis in this section should extend appropriately to all of these cases , but we content ourselves here with the most interesting case of an @xmath3 structure .    for abelian heterotic supergravity , with no @xmath1 ,",
    "the supersymmetry equations ( [ omegaeqn ] ) , ( [ omegaeqn ] ) , ( [ hflux ] ) are also supplemented by the gauge field equations [ f11 ] & = & 0  , + [ hym ] & = & 0  . the first equation ( [ f11 ] )",
    "says that the @xmath0 gauge field strength @xmath112 has hodge type @xmath179 , while ( [ hym ] ) is the _ hermitian - yangs - mills _ ( hym )",
    "equation for the gauge field .",
    "these are equivalent to the instanton equation for @xmath112 .",

    "we write explicit formulas for the rotated @xmath3 structure , and briefly demonstrate how the @xmath3 structure equations , hym equation and bianchi identity are satisfied",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the transformation of the holomorphic @xmath183-form @xmath175 in the next subsection .",
    "we now suppress the minkowski space directions , which may be absorbed into the rotation - invariant @xmath184 and play no role , and denote the initial calabi - yau three - fold metric by g & = & ( + a)^2 + vg _  , [ initcy ] where @xmath185 is now a five - dimensional transverse metric . the initial khler form and holomorphic @xmath183-form",
    "are , in a hopefully obvious notation , & = & e_(+ a ) + v _  , + [ omega ] & = & ( v e_+ ( + a ) ) v^1/2 _  .",
    "since the initial killing spinor is assumed to be invariant under @xmath82 , it follows that so are @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "notice that @xmath186 , where the complex structure , metric and khler form are related via @xmath187 . with this sign convention , @xmath188 acting on functions @xmath189 .",
    "this sign convention is opposite to much of the mathematics literature , but is more common in the physics literature .",
    "the closure of @xmath174 and @xmath175 immediately lead to [ operp ] e_= 0  , ( v^1/2_)=0  . denoting",
    "rotated quantities with primes as before , we have [ rotatedomega ] ^-2  & = & ^2 + ^2 e_v^1/2 _  , which we immediately see is closed , as required by ( [ omegaeqn ] ) .",
    "in these equations one should understand that we have formally replaced @xmath87 by @xmath143 in unrotated quantities such as @xmath175  recall this is the diffeomorphism between @xmath173 and @xmath181 . using the explicit form of @xmath162 in ( [ curvatures ] )",
    "it is also straightforward to check that @xmath190 , so that @xmath162 is type @xmath179 .",
    "the rotated two - form is ^-2 & = & ^2 + ^2 _  , so that ^-2   & = & ^2 + ^2 v _ _  .",
    "hence [ djeqn ] ( ^-2   ) & = & 0 ( v _ _ ) = 0  .",
    "but this follows immediately using ( [ operp ] ) and _ _ & = & _ | _  , which in turns follows from @xmath191 .",

    "finally , in our conventions @xmath195 , so we obtain &=&(|- )   , which is equation ( [ hflux ] ) .",
    "the above provides an alternative proof that the rotation preserves supersymmetry in this particular case .",
    "as already mentioned , very similar computations could be done starting with other special holonomy manifolds .",
    "however , the main reason for presenting the above results is that we shall investigate in more detail how the complex structure and other pure spinor ( in the sense of @xcite ) @xmath196 transform in the next section .      in this section",
    "we prove that the rotated complex structure , starting with a calabi - yau three - fold , is in fact invariant .",
    "equivalently , @xmath197 is proportional to the original @xmath175 , after an appropriate diffeomorphism .",
    "this claim is not at all obvious from the formula ( [ rotatedomega ] ) for @xmath198 in terms of @xmath175 .",
    "thus the heterotic rotation may be regarded as fixing the underlying complex manifold , but rotating the solution from khler to non - khler .    in an appropriate coordinate patch",
    "we may introduce complex coordinates @xmath199 and a khler potential @xmath200 so that the initial calabi - yau metric is g & = & 4 _ a|_b k z^a |z^b  , where @xmath201 .",
    "we may also choose @xmath202 , where @xmath82 generates the @xmath0 isometry , and correspondingly @xmath203 .",
    "in terms of our earlier notation , it is then straightforward to compute [ stuff ] v =  , a = ( |_i _ xk |z^i - _ i _ x k z^i )  , where @xmath204 . notice here that , although both @xmath205 and @xmath200 are defined only locally in each coordinate patch , with khler transformations acting on @xmath200 between patches , nevertheless the quantity @xmath206 is a globally defined function on @xmath173 .",

    "notice we may also write [ veperp ] ve_= x + ( _ i _ x k z^i + |_i _ x k |z^i )  .",
    "we now turn to the rotated holomorphic @xmath183-form , which after rewriting ( [ rotatedomega ] ) is ^-2  & = & v^1/2 _  .",
    "this then differs from @xmath175 in ( [ omega ] ) only in the @xmath209 term .",
    "using the expression for @xmath210 in ( [ stuff ] ) together with ( [ veperp ] ) this is ^-2  & = & ( x + ^2 e_+ w + _ i _ x k z^i ) v^1/2 _  , + & = & ( x + ^2 e_+ w)v^1/2 _  . here in the second line",
    "we have used that the closed complex two - form @xmath211 is proportional to @xmath212 .",

    "the latter are simply trivial constant shifts of @xmath214 , and thus ( [ coordchange ] ) defines a global diffeomorphism of @xmath173 and @xmath181 which takes @xmath175 into @xmath216 .",

    "compare this with the rotation in @xcite , where the same pure spinor instead picks up a _ phase _ in the rotated solution .      in this section we present simple explicit examples of non - khler deformations of calabi - yau geometries .",
    "namely , we discuss the gibbons - hawking and resolved conifold metrics .",

    "this is most clear when the t - dual solution has different topology ; manifestly , one can not then obtain the t - dual solution as a smooth limit @xmath252 of smooth supergravity solutions , as the underlying manifolds have different topology .",
    "more computationally , the metric in the @xmath143 coordinates ( [ wcoords ] ) is clearly degenerate at @xmath127 .",
    "instead the regular t - dual metric in this limit is described by giving a finite periodicity to the original @xmath165 coordinate .",
    "returning to the conifold example , the most interesting case is perhaps that with @xmath254 , @xmath255 . in this case , and as is well - known , the t - dual solution describes the back - reaction of two five - branes in flat spacetime . in the above coordinates , the two five - branes arise from the codimension four fixed point sets at @xmath256 , @xmath257 , which are two copies of @xmath258 parametrized by @xmath259 .",

    "in this section we restore the @xmath1 of section [ heteroticsection ] , and carefully describe in what sense the rotated solutions in the previous two sections are solutions to the low - energy limit of heterotic string theory .",
    "the supergravity fields in section [ heteroticsection ] of course have an expansion in @xmath1 .",
    "these are taylor expansions around @xmath261 , and in general we denote the coefficient of @xmath262 with a subscript @xmath178 .",

    "this is indeed true of the chern connection .",
    "however , the chern connection is _ not _ in general an instanton .",

    "@xmath174 is the type @xmath179 ( non)-khler form , @xmath277 denotes the curvature of the chern connection , and @xmath169 denotes its torsion . if the gravitino equation and bianchi identity hold , up to order @xmath1 , _ and _ the chern connection is an instanton ( at zeroth order )",

    "the problem with choosing the chern connection in the bianchi identity is then that supersymmetry and the bianchi identity do _ not _ imply the correct equations of motion  again , we refer also to appendix [ integrability ] .      comparing the heterotic string equations of motion ( [ hetstringeom ] ) with the abelian heterotic supergravity equations ( [ heteom ] ) , one sees that they are essentially the same , up to some small , but important , differences .",
    "firstly , the heterotic string gauge field @xmath9 is non - abelian , while in the abelian heterotic supergravity theory that embeds into type ii , the gauge field @xmath81 is abelian .",

    "secondly , the gauge field in the heterotic string is accompanied by factors of @xmath1 in the action .",
    "thirdly , the heterotic string also has higher derivative terms at this order in @xmath1 .",
    "let us now turn to our rotated abelian heterotic solutions , focusing on the simpler case ( [ rotatedcy ] ) in section [ cycase ] .",
    "in order not to cause confusion in what follows , we keep the primes in ( [ rotatedcy ] ) , now regarding these primes as denoting an abelian heterotic supergravity solution , without any @xmath1 .",
    "we note first that when @xmath261 , the gauge field no longer appears in the low - energy action of the heterotic string .",
    "this suggests that in order to introduce an @xmath1 dependence into the rotated solutions ( [ rotatedcy ] ) , we set the rotation angle [ deltaalpha ] & = &  . this is simply because when @xmath261 the solution should have zero gauge field , which implies that @xmath131 should also be zero .",
    "we then define [ as ] & = &   , + & = & -+o( )  . here",
    "one should be more precise about how the @xmath280 gauge field @xmath281 is embedded into the heterotic gauge group .",
    "obviously , there are choices .",

    "the purely imaginary , skew - symmetric matrix here embeds the @xmath0 gauge field @xmath281 as an @xmath282 subgroup of either @xmath7 or @xmath283 . however , most of what we say will be independent of these details , and we thus suppress this for the time being .",
    "the explicit introduction of @xmath284 in ( [ as ] ) and normalization in ( [ inbed ] ) ensures that the kinetic terms are then related as @xmath285 , and similarly now the bianchi identity @xmath286 becomes @xmath287 . since the other fields already appear at order zero , we simply set @xmath288 , @xmath289 and @xmath290 , where the primed fields now depend on @xmath1 via ( [ deltaalpha ] ) .",
    "the full solution is then easily computed to be [ alphasoln ] g&= & g _ - ( +a)(+a- ) + o(^2 )  , + ^2 & = & ^2_0+o(^2 )  , + & = & -+o( )  , + b&= & -a+o(^2 )  .",
    "this is a one - parameter family of deformations of the original calabi - yau metric , with deformation parameter @xmath291 . at zeroth order",
    "the solution is calabi - yau , with @xmath292 .",
    "notice that the zeroth order gauge field @xmath293 is non - zero ; however , at this order the gauge field does not appear in the action . by construction ,",
    "( [ alphasoln ] ) , _ including _ the infinite @xmath1 expansion coming from the original solution ( [ rotatedcy ] ) , solves the supersymmetry equations ( [ hetstringsusy ] ) _ exactly _ up to and including first order in @xmath1 .",
    "however , from a physical perspective one should truncate the solution at order @xmath266 , as we have done in ( [ alphasoln ] ) , since the supersymmetry equations will receive corrections at this order .",
    "however , the bianchi identity ( [ hetstringbianchi ] ) is solved _ without _ the higher derivative terms in @xmath46 .",
    "we may try to incorporate this using a modification of the standard embedding .",
    "notice that @xmath294 is simply the curvature tensor of the original calabi - yau metric , and as such indeed solves the instanton equation at _",
    "zeroth order_. this is also an @xmath3 connection .",
    "perhaps the minimal choice of `` modified standard embedding '' is then to write the following @xmath295 gauge field [ fullgauge ] _ & = &  q_4 + ^ _  , where _ 4 & = & (    cccccc & 0&0&0 & & + 0&-&0&0 & & + 0&0&-&0 & & + 0&0&0&- + & & & & & + & & & & & 0    )  . here",
    "the spin connection of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath296 , which is an @xmath3 connection , is understood to be embedded in the @xmath114 block that commutes with @xmath297 .",

    "notice here that it is crucial that the @xmath0 gauge field commutes with the @xmath3 spin connection of the original calabi - yau metric in ( [ fullgauge ] ) , ensuring that these terms do not mix in the wedge product and associated matrix multiplication .",
    "of course , it is also important that both are traceless",
    ".    the first term in ( [ fullgauge ] ) solves the instanton equation up to and including @xmath272 , by construction .",
    "however , @xmath298 is only an instanton _ at zeroth order_. thus at this point we have solved all equations up to and including @xmath272 , _ except _ the instanton equation , which is solved only at zeroth order .",
    "however , notice that the gauge field @xmath9 enters the action ( [ hetstringaction ] ) already at order @xmath1 .",
    "thus an @xmath272 correction to @xmath9 enters the action at _ second order _ , while the corresponing @xmath272 corrections to the metric , dilaton and @xmath16-field enter at first order . in this sense",
    ", we already have a solution up to and including @xmath272 . nevertheless , we shall briefly comment further on higher order corrections below .",
    "the gauge field ( [ fullgauge ] ) lies in a @xmath299 subgroup of the full heterotic gauge group .",
    "the maximal commuting subgroup in @xmath10 is then @xmath300 , where @xmath13 is the commutant of @xmath301 in @xmath10 and the @xmath0 factor is the same as that in ( [ fullgauge ] ) .",
    "indeed , an alternative way to think about this is that the initial solution with @xmath111 has only an @xmath3 gauge field turned on , via the standard embedding , and as such has commutant @xmath11 .",
    "then the rotation turns on an additional @xmath0 gauge field which breaks this to @xmath300 .",
    "although our solutions here are non - compact , one might imagine that these are good _ local models _ for a compact non - khler heterotic solution .",
    "for example , the conifold metric is believed to model a neighbourhood of a compact calabi - yau manifold near to a conifold transition , and our rotation then applies directly to the resolved and deformed conifolds . in this",
    "setting , and assuming our gauge field extends globally as a @xmath302 or @xmath301 gauge field , then the low - energy gauge group in @xmath303 is @xmath13 . in particular ,",
    "in the former case the @xmath0 commutant obtains a mass via the green - schwarz mechanism  at least , this is so in the calabi - yau case , as discussed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "thus the rotation effectively breaks the initial @xmath11 gauge group to @xmath13 .",
    "a slight generalization of the above contruction can be given when the initial solution has non - zero @xmath304 .",
    "as explained in section [ alpexp ] , via the standard embedding using hull s connection in this case the initial non - abelian gauge field lies in an @xmath301 subgroup ( the holonomy of the @xmath305 connection ) of @xmath10 .",
    "the rotation turns on an abelian gauge field via the embedding _ & = & ",
    "q_5 + _ 0 ^ -  , where @xmath306 , thus breaking the low - energy gauge group to @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to @xcite , solutions amenable to this construction include the @xmath307 bundles over conformally hyper - khler two - folds , presented explicitly in @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief comment on the possibility of correcting ( [ fullgauge ] ) at order @xmath1 to solve the instanton equation at this order .",
    "notice that this correction , whatever it is , does _ not _ affect the bianchi identity ( [ fullbianchi ] ) , since such a correction enters at @xmath44 in the bianchi identity .",
    "the philosophy from here follows the important , but relatively unknown , paper by witten and witten @xcite .",
    ", which means that the metric is calabi - yau only to leading order .",
    "despite the large number of papers on this subject , @xcite only has 21 references on spires at the time of writing . ]",
    "we write the non - abelian gauge field , up to and including order @xmath1 , as [ fullfull ] ^(1 ) & = & _ +  s  , where @xmath145 is an @xmath1-independent one - form with values in the lie algebra of @xmath301 .",
    "notice here that @xmath308 , as we have defined it , contains all powers of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the ( perhaps confusing ) notation above implies that @xmath309 and @xmath310 expanding everything in powers of @xmath1 and collecting all linear terms we obtain the equations _ 0 ^(1)_1 & = & - _ 1 ^(1)_0  , + _ 0 _ 0 ^(1)_1 & = & -2 _ 0 _ 1 ^(1)_0  .",
    "[ qww ] the left hand sides of these equations are just the usual instanton equations , and vanish if one replaces @xmath311 by @xmath312 , by construction .",
    "the right hand sides are then `` source '' terms .",
    "one could decompose @xmath311 into irreducible representations with respect to the zeroth order structure , and use the equations above to determine its components .",
    "however , @xmath311 is not arbitrary , since the bianchi identity for the gauge field implies ^(1)_1 & = & ^(1)_1 + _ 0^(1)_1 + ^(1)_1 _ 0  .",
    "notice that the equations ( [ qww ] ) are linear , first order pdes for the connection @xmath145 , where all other terms are known from the rotated solution",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate this system further .",
    "in this paper we have studied a solution - generating transformation in the context of heterotic supergravity , with a non - trivial @xmath0 gauge field in the cartan subgroup of @xmath313 or @xmath7 . in particular ,",
    "we have discussed how this transformation preserves supersymmetry . in the case of backgrounds of the form",
    "@xmath172 we have explicitly shown that solutions obtained as rotations of calabi - yau geometries satisfy the non - khler equations , and that the complex structure remains invariant .",
    "one of the main observations we have made is that heterotic solutions with an abelian gauge field can be formally mapped to type ii solutions , where the heterotic gauge field becomes a component of the metric in an internal space of one dimension higher ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "based on this , we have seen that an @xmath19 subgroup of the ( abelian ) heterotic duality group @xmath18 is effectively embedded into an @xmath102 subgroup of the type ii t - duality group .",
    "we thus realize the heterotic transformation as a simple combination of rotations and ordinary buscher t - duality in type ii theories .",
    "this relationship perhaps deserves to be further studied .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to investigate whether a suitable notion of heterotic generalized geometry exists based on the @xmath18 duality group , generalizing the generalized geometry that puts the metric and @xmath16-field on the same footing in type ii .    in the context of heterotic string theory , taking into proper account",
    "the parameter @xmath1 leads to some modifications of the discussion .",
    "firstly , although the solution - generating formulae formally contain an infinite series , although the precise transformation of the fields may be corrected . ] in powers of @xmath1 , the equations of motion , supersymmetry variations and bianchi identities for the heterotic theory are only known up to some low order in the @xmath1 expansion @xcite .",
    "therefore , the transformation only makes sense if the expansions are truncated at the appropriate order .",
    "in addition , the duality transformations do not apply to non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "as we discussed , it turns out that it is quite simple to remedy this , and obtain supersymmetric heterotic solutions at _ first order _ in @xmath1 , including a non - abelian gauge field with a slightly modified standard embedding .",
    "thus , given any ( non - compact ) calabi - yau geometry , we have constructed non - khler solutions , breaking the heterotic gauge group from @xmath11 ( for the calabi - yau with standard embedding ) to the gut gauge group @xmath13 .",
    "going back to the type ii setting , the transformation we discussed is then _ exact _ , since the gauge field is just a metric component and hence appears at the same ( lowest ) order in @xmath1 here .",
    "we may then start in type ii with the direct product of a calabi - yau geometry with a circle , and the transformation will `` twist '' this circle over the base calabi - yau ( although topologically this twisting is always trivial ) , with the base becoming precisely a non - khler geometry . furthermore , we can start with any supersymmetric solution with non - trivial @xmath16-field , and also perform the transformation .",
    "for example , one could apply this rotation to the maldacena - nuez solution @xcite .",
    "notice that if we start with a type iib solution of the form @xmath314 , a t - duality along @xmath315 will give a @xmath316 geometry in type iia .",
    "we can then peform a rotation in the @xmath89 plane , and finally another t - duality along the rotated @xmath317 .",
    "let us call this a trt transformation . if we peform a further rotation of the final type iib solution , we have simply composed a t - duality with our solution - generating transformation .",
    "however , from a _ physical _ point of view , the second rotation does nothing , and hence effectively we have performed a trt transformation .",
    "this is ( locally ) equivalent to a tst transformation , as shown in appendix [ trtappendix ] .",
    "the latter can be interpreted in the dual field theory ( when this exists ) as a _",
    "dipole deformation _ @xcite . in these cases",

[ liftedid ] this is derived using only the dilatino ( [ dilat ] ) and gaugino ( [ gaugi ] ) supersymmetry equations .",
