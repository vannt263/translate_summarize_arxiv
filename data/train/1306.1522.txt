    "this work is concerned with @xmath1 ym theory ( qcdn ) in 4d .",
    "qcdn admits a large @xmath0 expansion  @xcite . lattice work has shown that there is confinement at finite and infinite @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "then , qcdn at @xmath2 ( qcd@xmath3 ) is similar to the starting point of the topological expansion ( te )  @xcite . in te one constructs iteratively an s - matrix from a set of postulated basic general properties .",
    "another starting point for the te is provided by string theory . in both cases",
    "one starts from a system consisting of an infinite set of stable particles interacting weakly at linear order . upon iteration",
    ", other singularities build up .",
    "the expansion is organized diagrammatically with an order given by the genus of a riemann surface .",
    "the qcdn route is better founded than the string one .",
    "we can safely assume that there exist wightman @xmath4-point functions of local gauge invariant observables that admit a single valued continuation to the extended tube @xmath5  @xcite for any @xmath0 .",
    "these functions determine the leading nontrivial term in @xmath6 of any amplitude entering the s - matrix . from this off shell starting point one might be able to build a better founded qcdn string theory  @xcite .",
    "concretely , one would need explicit forms of a least some of the sets of entries of the s - matrix .    despite quite a few papers which achieved high levels of popularity ,",
    "there is not one non - perturbative physical number that has been analytically calculated , or , at least credibly estimated , in qcdn ( with or without a finite number of quarks ) at leading order in @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , interest in large @xmath0 does not seem to die out .",
    "quite a few workers , me included , still are trying to get some new quantitative result in qcdn which rests on the simplification afforded by @xmath8 .",
    "my idea has been to find a simple physical single scale observable whose behavior as a function of this scale showed a universal behavior at the crossover separating long from short scales .",
    "large @xmath0 comes in to provide this universality by a large @xmath0 phase transition .",
    "the universality then becomes a random - matrix type of universality .",
    "the hope is to exploit it in order to match an effective string descriptions holding at large distances to perturbation theory holding at short distances .",
    "for example , consider a circular wilson loop of radius @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath9 large effective string theory provides some universal information about the @xmath9 dependence , while at small @xmath9 perturbation theory applies ; the new ingredient is that random matrix universality would provide the means to connect these two dependencies .",
    "the hope is that an approximate connection between the string tension and some standard perturbative scale would then be calculable .",
    "the existence of the large @xmath0 phase transition is believable for the circular loop because it has been established numerically for square loops .",
    "however , it would be preferable to consider smooth loops also on the lattice , and this leaves us with only polyakov loops winding around a compactified direction .",
    "the length of this circle has to be bounded from below in order to stay in the confined phase .",
    "the single eigenvalue density , @xmath10 , of a polyakov loop becomes uniform at @xmath2 on account of the well known @xmath11 symmetry .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath12 , the connected correlation function of the @xmath10 s of two separated polyakov loops , as the simplest smooth observable on the lattice .    in this paper ,",
    "i focus on polyakov loops .",
    "the outline of the papers is : sections [ vol_red ] and [ two_loop_a ] provide background material .",
    "the concrete new results are in [ two_loop_b ] .",
    "they consist of an evaluation of the single polyakov eigenvalue density connected two point correlation function under the assumption of second rank casimir dominance .",
    "a formula for any @xmath0 ( taken as odd , for simplicity ) is provided , the large @xmath0 limit is taken and the validity of the latter is checked numerically .",
    "next , a brief comparison with monte carlo data in four dimensional @xmath1 yang mills theory is carried out .",
    "there are no large @xmath0 phase transitions .",
    "incidentally it is noted that the result does not show universal features known to hold for large hermitian matrix ensembles .",
    "section [ other ] contains ideas for future work . a short summary concludes the paper .",
    "qcdn is a field theory , but geometrically the fundamental variables are not fields defined over @xmath13 , but rather fields defined over loops in @xmath14 .",
    "this becomes particularly evident when one introduced a lattice uv cutoff : one can derive an infinite set of equations connecting various loop operators and the equations reflect the ordinary locality of four - space the field theoretical formulation rests on , without any of the collateral expenditures ( gauge fixing , faddeev - popov ghosts , gribov ambiguities ) associated with formulating the continuum theory in terms of gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "the loop equations self - truncate at infinite @xmath0 , feeding the hope that it ought to be easier to handle non - perturbative issues of qcdn at @xmath2  @xcite . taking the equations to the continuum",
    "is hampered by the nonexistence of anything resembling a decent calculus in loop space .",
    "one way to go around this obstacle is to try to guess a well defined solution directly in the continuum ( which obeys general symmetry / unitarity constraints ) and show that it satisfies a set of equations that can be viewed as a concrete realization of the formal continuum loop equations  @xcite .",
    "this has led to progress in string theory and even to a connection back to field theory , but not for qcdn  @xcite .",
    "as far as i know , we still do not have even one nontrivial example where the formal loop equations have been credibly defined in the continuum .",
    "one consequence of the loop equation is that at @xmath2 the replacement of @xmath14 by @xmath15 , where the sides of the torus are all larger than the inverse deconfinement temperature , preserves a large subset of observables with no dependence on the actual finite length of these sides  @xcite .",
    "this is of some help in numerical work , but the saving is quite limited  @xcite .",
    "the term describing this phenomenon is `` reduction '' , on account of a reduction in the number of degrees of freedom as far as the four volume size goes .",
    "reduction can be applied to any number of directions and one assumes that there is a hierarchy of scales associated with the preservation of the associated @xmath16 , @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the restriction on the sides of @xmath15 ensures that the global @xmath18 symmetry now present is not broken spontaneously by the @xmath2 limit .",
    "the preservation of the consequence of this symmetry on expectation values of parallel transport round non - contractible loops is a necessary ingredient for reduction  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 loops equations breaks down if @xmath18 is not obeyed by expectation values of winding loops at @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath18 is preserved at @xmath2 , the spacings between momenta induced by the finite volume of @xmath15 get continuously filled in by the eigenvalue - sets of winding loops  @xcite .",
    "polyakov loops are the natural extra observables one has when considering @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that the compact direction is large enough that the one @xmath11 is preserved at all @xmath0 . when we slice @xmath20 by three - spaces parallel , or orthogonal , to the compact direction we find two different transfer matrices .",
    "they provide two hamiltonian pictures",
    ". in one picture @xmath11 is just an extra global symmetry of the hilbert space and the system is at zero temperature . in the other ,",
    "the system is at finite temperature . in either case ,",
    "one has a hilbert space which can be chosen to transform irreducibly under the symmetries commuting with the hamiltonian .",
    "the spaces and hamiltonians are different , providing different spectral representations of identical observables .",
    "reduction applies only to non - winding loops ; it is of interest to see if any reduction - related simplifications hold at @xmath2 also for winding loops  @xcite .",
    "define the parallel transport winding loop operator by : @xmath21 the compact direction is 4 .",
    "@xmath22 are the gauge fields given by traceless hermitian @xmath23 matrices and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is path ordering .",
    "polyakov loops are independent of @xmath26 : @xmath27 @xmath28 labels an irreducible representation of @xmath1 , @xmath29 is the character in @xmath28 and @xmath30 is the dimension of @xmath28 .",
    "if the number of boxes in the young pattern corresponding to @xmath28 is @xmath31 , the @xmath0-ality of @xmath28 is given by @xmath32 .",
    "under @xmath11 we have @xmath33 .",
    "consider the case @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath35 and @xmath36 is generically nonzero . here",
    "@xmath37 is conjugate to @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath9 is a positive distance . denoting the length of the compact direction by @xmath38 ,",
    "the two point function is a function of @xmath28 and the two length scales @xmath39 .",
    "define ( formally ) @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath41-parameter in front of the @xmath42 $ ] parameter in the action is set to zero , so @xmath43 is real and positive .",
    "the definition is only formal because after renormalization there will be an arbitrary term in @xmath44 of the form @xmath45 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 is well defined up to an additive constant  @xcite .      since @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the deconfinement temperature",
    ", the first reaction would be that @xmath49 can not be computed in perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless , to some extent , the quantity @xmath50 can . instead of the @xmath51 limit in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) one takes an infinite uncompactified @xmath26 axis and replaces @xmath38 by @xmath52 and @xmath53 by the logarithm of a rectangular wilson loop of shape @xmath54 .",
    "inspection of feynman diagrams shows that in the @xmath55 limit one has an expansion for @xmath56 up to two loop order in the coupling which ought to be useful for @xmath9 small enough . to go to higher loops one needs to include non - analytic terms in the coupling  @xcite .",
    "pnrqcd provides a prescription for how to do this , but i doubt that it is unique  @xcite .    in this expansion",
    "the path integral over @xmath57 is expanded around @xmath58 , which breaks the @xmath11 .",
    "this may not matter for the two point polyakov loop function at infinite @xmath38 .",
    "whether it can be used at any finite @xmath38 is an open question , so long as @xmath47 .",
    "if there were a credible perturbative regime in which the @xmath38-scale can somehow be removed from the problem , one would expect that @xmath12 might show some crossover as @xmath9 is varied .",
    "then , the ingredients necessary for a large @xmath0 phase transition to develop are present .",
    "the hope is that , for @xmath9 small enough , the eigenvalues of one polyakov loop would restrict the fluctuations of the eigenvalues of the other polyakov loop to such a degree that the periodicity in the angle differences would barely be felt .",
    "for @xmath9 large this periodicity would get restored to full strength .",
    "a separating crossover at finite @xmath0 would become a phase transition at infinite @xmath0 .",
    "the intuition behind the focus on eigenvalues is that collectively their fluctuation explore the distance of parallel transport operators from unity . only when the compactness of the group is felt does one expect non - perturbative effects to become important .",
    "compactness is felt only when parallel transport exceeds a certain distance from unity .",
    "we shall see that the hope for a transition is not realized .    beyond perturbation theory ,",
    "@xmath56 is the ground state energy of the hamiltonian associated with evolution in the @xmath26 direction in the sector defined to transform under the local gauge group as @xmath28 at @xmath59 and @xmath37 at @xmath60 .",
    "this ground state is @xmath61 degenerate .",
    "when one computes the partition function viewing @xmath38 as the inverse temperature , the degeneracy of the ground state cancels the prefactors normalizing the polyakov loop operators .",
    "there is no overall factor of @xmath62 in the physical piece of the free energy .",
    "because of the representation content of the hilbert space which breaks translation invariance , there is no physical interpretation in this picture for plane waves propagating in the @xmath63 directions superposing ground state states . because the sources can move . at three loop order the expansion in powers of the strong - force coupling breaks down , but the non - analytic term responsible for this ( in this framework ) can be derived . ]",
    "the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath9 for @xmath65 starts with a constant ( the string tension of open strings with fixed endpoints transforming as @xmath28 and @xmath37 respectively ) and continues to subleading orders ; several terms in this expansion are universal .",
    "i shall describe below in more detail this aspect in another asymptotic limit .",
    "one can also consider the large @xmath9-separation fixed @xmath38 limit : @xmath66 confinement in this context means that @xmath67 , with @xmath68 depending only on the assumed non - zero @xmath0-ality of @xmath28 , @xmath4 ; @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 gives the @xmath38-derivative of the @xmath9-derivative at @xmath71 of eigenvalues of the hamiltonian describing evolution in any one of the directions @xmath72 in the @xmath4-sector of the global @xmath11 .",
    "now , it does make sense to superpose states and project on zero spatial momentum .",
    "this gives the ground state energy in the @xmath4-winding sector .",
    "one can look at several subleading terms in the large @xmath38 expansion . for this define @xmath73 @xmath74 assuming an effective string theory description one derives from symmetry principles alone that the coefficients @xmath75 are universal calculable finite numbers , independent of @xmath28 ( and consequentially of @xmath4 ) .",
    "they are actually also independent of any other detail regarding the field theory , except the assumption of confinement and applicability of effective string theory  @xcite .    to summarize : at any finite @xmath0 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath28 of nonzero @xmath0-ality have some universal coefficients in their asymptotic expansions in @xmath9 and @xmath38 respectively , which follow from the assumption of confinement and applicability of effective string theory .",
    "numerical checks have yielded results consistent with this .",
    "the @xmath78 limit provides no further simplification with respect to these properties .   and the @xmath78 limit would turn the interactions off .",
    "one would need the @xmath78 limit in order to justify the focus on the lowest genus surface relevant to the correlation under investigation .",
    "the effective string theory on the other hand has already summed up all contributions from handles of the dream string theory , and the universal results provided by the cylinder are @xmath0-independent .",
    "] there is a hope that the @xmath78 limit could provide a clear demarcation point for the domain in which the asymptotic expansion of long strings can make any sense at all , but the universal predictions of effective string theory are insensitive to this .",
    "effective string theory can also be applied to the case where @xmath38 and @xmath9 are both taken to infinity ; a brief overview with references to original work can be found in  @xcite .",
    "this can be done also for ordinary contractible rectangular wilson loops in @xmath14 .",
    "reduction applies in these cases .",
    "there is no lower limit on @xmath38 or @xmath9 and therefore there is a perturbative regime .",
    "renormalization to remove perimeter divergences is still required .",
    "again , for individual irreducible representations large @xmath0 provides no additional constraints on the universal large @xmath39 results of effective string theory .",
    "however , now there is an evident connection to a perturbative regime where both @xmath38 and @xmath9 are small .",
    "this connection is smooth . only by looking at many representations",
    "simultaneously does one detect a large @xmath0 transition : one finds a non - analyticity in the single eigenvalue distribution at a point which serves as a boundary between the perturbative and non - perturbative regime  @xcite .",
    "the boundary location depends on an arbitrary dimensional smearing parameter .",
    "this parameter is a remnant of the need to eliminate the perimeter divergence .",
    "it is defined in a manner independent of @xmath28  @xcite . only at infinite @xmath0",
    "is there a well defined transition point . for any finite @xmath0",
    "one has only a cross - over .",
    "numerical and analytical considerations indicate that the large @xmath0 transition has a certain random - matrix model universality  @xcite .    at any finite @xmath0",
    "the polyakov loop two point function has a discontinuity as @xmath38 is varied through @xmath79 separating the confined and deconfined phases . since one can compute @xmath56 in perturbation theory at @xmath80 , one may hope that a specifically transition as @xmath9 is varied takes place at any @xmath38 in the confined phase .",
    "lattice checks of predictions of effective string theory have overall been successful , at times even surprisingly successful ; this has nothing to do with @xmath0 being large enough . just like effective lagrangians for massless pions work already on the lattice since these lagrangians can parametrize any reasonable uv behavior , effective string theory",
    "should also hold directly on the lattice so long as one is in the rough phase . for long strings the lattice violation of @xmath81 invariance makes an impact determined by symmetries .",
    "if we replace the hypercubic lattice by an @xmath82 lattice  @xcite , the effective string theory predictions may apply even better .",
    "so , the success of lattice checks of effective string theory might be `` explained '' by the relative unimportance of the proximity of the field theoretical continuum limit .",
    "for example , qcdn with scalar matter fields in the adjoint has no continuum limit ; on the lattice it would confine and effective string theory would make some universal predictions in the rough phase of the loop under consideration .    in general , strings are less sensitive to high mode cutoffs than field theories are  @xcite . in four dimensions",
    "there is an exception  @xcite which has to do with the fluctuations in the extrinsic string curvature .",
    "potentially significant deviations from effective string theory were observed in  @xcite and independently in  @xcite ; in  @xcite these deviations were tentatively attributed to the corners of lattice loops because of the perturbation theory experience with the corner divergences in wilson loops .",
    "the technical reason for the universality of the large @xmath0 transition in the case of contractible wilson loops has been second rank casimir dominance of the dependence phase transitions . ] on the representation @xmath28 .",
    "one may then map the size parameters that are varied into an appropriate measure of separation in 2d ym .",
    "so , we ask whether there is a large @xmath0 phase transition to be found in an analysis of polyakov loop correlators in ym on a 2d cylinder .",
    "in general , it is known that there are large @xmath0 non - analyticities in 2d ym on a cylinder  @xcite . here",
    "we wish to see if they show up in the two point function of the single eigenvalue distributions associated with two separated polyakov loops . in the context of large size",
    "hermitian matrices two point single eigenvalue correlation functions have been shown to have some universal properties  @xcite .",
    "a side result of the calculation below will be to check whether this universality extends to the simplest unitary matrices ensemble with a global @xmath11 symmetry . from experience with hermitian matrix models we expect smooth and strongly fluctuating contributions to the two point eigenvalue function of equal magnitude ; the oscillating piece has to be first separated out and only the remaining smooth piece can exhibit a universal large @xmath0 phase transition .    in the subsequent equations the assumption that @xmath0 is odd is made implicitly .",
    "the partition function of @xmath1 ym on a 2d cylinder connecting two loops , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , is given by  @xcite : @xmath85 @xmath86 is the area in some area unit . let @xmath87 and @xmath88 be the single eigenvalue distributions associated with the @xmath23 unitary matrices @xmath89 respectively  @xcite : @xmath90 the @xmath91 are the eigenvalues of @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the @xmath94-periodic delta - function .",
    "the character expansion of @xmath95 is : @xmath96 \\label{rhoone}\\ ] ] the irreducible representation @xmath97 has a young pattern in the shape of a width - one hook , with @xmath98 rows and @xmath99 columns .",

    "as @xmath0 is odd , this will happen only when one pair is the conjugate of the other .",
    "for odd @xmath0 there are no @xmath97 self - conjugate pairs .",

    "the @xmath118 integral can be done by saddle point with @xmath119 . to",
    "leading order in @xmath0 we get @xmath120 we need to keep the factor @xmath121 in the denominator of the first fraction in the integrand in order to ensure its regularity for @xmath122 , because then the numerator divides evenly by the denominator .",

    "the final results for the leading large @xmath0 behavior comes out to be : @xmath128 here , @xmath129 .",
    "the result is the sum of a smooth term and a rapidly oscillating one .",
    "there are no large @xmath0 phase transitions .",
    "the non - oscillating term is : @xmath130 it does not exhibit the universal structure seen in continuous chains of large hermitian matrix models  @xcite .",
    "most likely , the main difference is that for the unitary matrix ensemble we solved above there is no analogue of the nontrivial potential @xmath131 term in the action for the hermitian @xmath132 matrices . while the explicit form of @xmath133 is irrelevant , its mere presence is .    to get a feel for the goodness of the large @xmath0 limit and also check whether its derivation was correct , we present some figures below . we see that the large @xmath0 approximation deteriorates when @xmath0 decreases , when @xmath134 is close to @xmath135 and when @xmath86 is small , but otherwise holds well",
    "i now turn to 4d and report on some numerical simulation done in order to see qualitatively whether , overall , the data looks similar to the 2d case .",
    "i only wish to confirm that also in the 4d case there are no signs of a large @xmath0 transition .",
    "i do not aim here for anything quantitative and am content with low numerical precision .",

    "this means that we may as well consider the following finite-@xmath0 definition of @xmath12 : @xmath141 @xmath12 depends only on the angle difference on account of the @xmath11 symmetry .    in order to eliminate the uv divergences in 4d ,",
    "the gauge field configurations were smeared . unlike in previous work  @xcite , gauge fields along the direction separating the polyakov loops were left unsmeared ; smearing was only done for gauge fields tangent to all orthogonal three - spaces .",
    "thus , the gauge fields entering the polyakov loop are smeared .",
    "this is enough to remove the perimeter divergence , as can be seen from the formula of a massless propagator smeared in the above manner at infinite volume : @xmath142 one has then @xmath143 and the short distance singularity is regulated away .",
    "this removes the perimeter divergence at the cost of a dependence on the new scale @xmath144 . at the level of feynman",
    "diagrams it is obvious that this eliminates all uv perimeter divergences to any finite order , because the extra diagrams smearing introduces have a tree structure , reflecting the determinism of the smearing equation , which , in continuum notation reads : @xmath145 like in  @xcite , @xmath146 is a coordinate along a new direction .",
    "@xmath147 label directions orthogonal to the direction of separation between the two polyakov loops .",
    "@xmath148 and @xmath149 are the covariant derivative and field strength respectively .",
    "the three dimensional character of the smearing means that the quantities @xmath70 are @xmath146-independent on account of the limit @xmath65 which projects on the ground state of the relevant hamiltonian .",
    "smearing only affects the ( regularized ) matrix element of the operator between the singlet @xmath11 ground state and the nontrivial @xmath11 ground state .    in simulations we employed @xmath150 in lattice units , which is a moderate amount of smearing , found adequate in the study of contractible wilson loops  @xcite .",
    "the figures below show results from a lattice volume of @xmath151 with @xmath152 at inverse t hooft couplings , @xmath153 and separation @xmath154 in lattice units .",
    "we see that at fixed @xmath155 the general behavior resembles the analytical results in 2d with @xmath86 increasing with @xmath9 .",
    "one also sees a trend of increase in the difference from 2d as the angle difference increases .",
    "only the angle difference range of @xmath156 is plotted on account of the symmetry under simultaneous sign switch of @xmath139 . as @xmath155 increases the effective @xmath86 decreases , as expected on account of asymptotic freedom .",
    "the errors on the mc data are of the order of 10 percent but can not be reliably estimated .",
    "each figure shows , in addition to raw data , a smoothed curve obtained by a cubic spline smoothing method .",
    "the method of smoothing consists of a minimization of a weighted combination of some average of curve curvature and deviation from the data .",
    "the smoothing procedure is quite ad - hoc , and only serves to produce curves to guide the eye .",
    "i discovered no analogues to the large @xmath0 phase transition found for contractible wilson loops in @xmath14 in this case .",
    "the reason must be that one can not make @xmath38 small .",
    "if we try , we hit a discontinuity already at finite @xmath0 ; this discontinuity becomes quite spectacular at @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "there seems to be no way to qualitatively distinguish between the finite @xmath0 discontinuity and the @xmath2 one .",
    "so , we would like to work in a metastable phase where @xmath157 but @xmath11 is still a good symmetry . more mathematically",
    ", we want to analytically continue in @xmath38 from the low temperature to the high temperature phase .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite there is a way to define also a string description there .",
    "the instability in the string theory occurs when some winding string states go tachyonic  @xcite . and",
    "@xmath158 are given by the right and left winding numbers .",
    "the constraint on the closed string states that ties the left and right movers ends up leaving one extra integer labeling the string modes . for a small circumference ,",
    "nontrivial winding modes have positive mass squares , overcoming the negative additive contribution reflecting the ordinary tachyon , but for a larger circumference some of the winding modes have negative mass square .",
    "the smallest non - zero windings cross the tachyonic threshold at the hagedorn temperature . ]",
    "numerically , one might try to go into the metastable phase by using quenching .",
    "originally quenching was introduced as a device to maintain the global @xmath18 of @xmath15 and reduction to zero volume  @xcite , but the idea was flawed  @xcite .",
    "the flaw was that it still left alive an annealed mechanism for breaking the @xmath18 to some proper subgroup . without respecting full @xmath18 symmetry",
    ", reduction fails .",
    "however , when a single direction is compactified , the preservation of the single @xmath11 would not suffer from this flaw . to be sure ,",
    "we choose prime @xmath0 because then , unlike @xmath18 , @xmath11 has not proper subgroups .    the point would be to check numerically whether the condensation of winding states , which would occur beyond the hagedorn temperature , is something that occurs in the analytically continued field theory at finite @xmath0 as a phase transition ( continuous or not ) . the alternative might be that there is no such ordinary phase transition , since @xmath38 is small enough to enter a field theoretic perturbative regime where string theory of any traditional sort is inapplicable . then , on the basis of analogy with the contractible wilson loops , one would guess that a large @xmath0 phase transition would develop in the two point single eigenvalue correlation function .",
    "the investigation of this is left for the future .    the large @xmath0 phase transition for contractible loops",
    "is seen only when considering simultaneously many irreducible representations .",
    "they may be viewed as coming from multiple windings of the boundary of the loop . since the loop is contractible ,",
    "winding numbers are not conserved . in the polyakov case",
    "they are , at least for windings between 0 and @xmath159 .    the analytic continuation from @xmath160 to @xmath161 should provide a way to compute ( for small @xmath9 and @xmath38 ) @xmath53 from the two polyakov loop correlator directly and for arbitrary irreducible representations . the analytic continuation would amount to expanding around the one - loop unstable saddle point , given by @xmath162\\ ] ] for odd @xmath0 , @xmath163 , where @xmath164 indicates a diagonal matrix with the listed elements on its diagonal .",
    "this configuration is @xmath11 invariant , but unstable at one loop order .",
    "there are two ingredients in 2d ym : one is the `` propagator '' defining the cylinder with fixed circular boundaries and the other is the `` vertex '' which sews together three boundaries  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that it would be of interest to study the connected correlation function of three polyakov loops .",
    "the simplest example is to take 2 polyakov loops in the fundamental and a third in the irreducible representation made by combining two anti - fundamentals into a symmetric or anti - symmetric irreducible representation .",
    "take @xmath165 and odd .",
    "the three loops are positioned at distinct locations in @xmath166 . in euclidean space , using a different slicing this looks like a finite temperature setting for one among the many possible generalizations to large @xmath0 of @xmath167 baryons .",
    "three infinitely heavy quarks are connected by a v - shaped string configuration .",
    "one could go to minkowski space and endow these locations with zero masses , forcing them to evolve in time at the velocity of light .",
    "for open strings in minkowski space such a situation was looked at in the context of cosmic strings . for @xmath167",
    "this was considered in several papers , but the string tensions were taken to be equal  @xcite . an effective string theory valid at large separations",
    "would need to handle a case where one couples two strings of the same tension to one of a different tension .",
    "it seems to me that string tension considerations would favor a v - shaped arrangement of `` fundamental '' strings .",
    "it would be interesting to apply the methods of effective string theory to this setup . assuming the v - shape , in the field theory there would be a coupling associated with the vertex of the v. for large @xmath0 it would go as @xmath168 with a finite @xmath169 .    back to fixed sources ,",
    "the three point function of polyakov loops for the antisymmetric case is given by : @xmath170tr ( u_{p_3})\\rangle ( r_a , r_b,\\theta)\\ ] ] here , @xmath171 is at @xmath172 , @xmath173 is at @xmath174 and @xmath175 is at @xmath176 with @xmath177 and @xmath178 . the new ingredient is the presence of corners . in the case of rectangular wilson loops , corners may change the rules of effective string theory , by exhibiting a field theoretical dependence on loop sides which is not exponentially suppressed even for asymptotically large loops . here , the same question can be addressed in a different set - up . on a hypercubic lattice only @xmath41 values which are multiples of @xmath179",
    ". numerically there would be high noise problems , but it is worth a try .",
    "one could then get back at our main theme , and consider the connected three point function of the eigenvalues of the three loops . to search for large @xmath0 phase transitions one would need to look at three point connected correlations @xmath180 , depending on two eigenvalue - angle differences at infinite @xmath0 .",
    "it might be of interest to consider the problem of colliding two same direction wound polyakov loops in minkowski space .",
    "the three point vertex would enter twice to produce a two to two particle scattering dominated by the exchange of the symmetric and antisymmetric long strings with masses above and below threshold .",
    "the distribution of the excited string modes of the two separate outgoing strings might provide a thought experiment reminiscent to the bjorken model for high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "the correlations among single eigenvalue distributions associated with various polyakov loops has been studied for the simplest arrangement and found to provide no large-@xmath0 generated non - analyticities .",
    "the results might be of some interest in random matrix theory .",
    "one needs the interplay between different windings to get large @xmath0 phase transitions and also a perturbative regime .",
    "one idea was to somehow analytically continue in @xmath38 to @xmath181 and follow the evolution of the single eigenvalue distribution of a polyakov loop as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "the other was to construct arrangements involving mixtures of polyakov loops of different winding numbers .",
