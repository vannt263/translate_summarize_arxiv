    "<S> , we generalize a theorem of ebenfelt , khavinson and shapiro by characterizing fingerprints of polynomial pseudo - lemniscates .        </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of this paper is the following conjecture on the behavior of holomorphic functions on the closed unit disk .    </S>",
    "<S> [ conjrichards ] let @xmath0 be holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closure of the unit disk @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> then there is an injective holomorphic function @xmath2 and a polynomial @xmath3 such that @xmath4 on @xmath1 .    in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we say that @xmath0 and @xmath3 are _ conformally equivalent _ and that @xmath3 is a _ </S>",
    "<S> conformal model _ for @xmath0 on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath1 can be replaced by any jordan domain , by the riemann mapping theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> the above was conjectured by the first author in  @xcite , motivated by questions arising from the study of level curve configurations of meromorphic functions . </S>",
    "<S> the case where @xmath0 is a finite blaschke product follows from the work of ebenfelft , khavinson and shapiro  @xcite on the characterization of the so - called fingerprints of polynomial lemniscates . </S>",
    "<S> proofs of this special case were also given independently by the first author in  @xcite using level curves , and by the second author in  @xcite using a simple riemann surfaces welding argument combined with the uniformization theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> conjecture [ conjrichards ] was proved in full generality by george  lowther and david  speyer on the internet mathematics forum _ math.stackexchange.com_ , using lagrange interpolation and the inverse mapping theorem ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> our main motivation for this paper comes from the observation that the proof in  @xcite of the finite blaschke product case can easily be generalized to obtain a proof of conjecture  [ conjrichards ] , with some additional assumptions on the behavior of the function @xmath0 on @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> although this approach yields a slightly weaker result than that of lowther and speyer , it has considerable advantages . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the argument also works in the meromorphic setting , in which case the polynomial @xmath3 must be replaced by a rational map @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the proof is more enlightening in the sense that it gives some information on the rational map @xmath6 thereby obtained .    more precisely , our main result is the following .    </S>",
    "<S> [ mainthm ] let @xmath7 be a jordan domain with analytic boundary and let @xmath0 be a meromorphic function on some open neighborhood of the closure of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> assume that @xmath0 has no critical point on @xmath8 and that @xmath9 is a jordan curve whose bounded face contains @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> then there is an injective holomorphic function @xmath11 and a rational map @xmath6 of degree @xmath12 such that @xmath13 on @xmath7 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number of zeros and the number of poles of @xmath0 in @xmath7 , counting multiplicity .    </S>",
    "<S> the rational map @xmath6 may be chosen so that all of its zeros and poles are in @xmath16 , except for a pole of multiplicity @xmath17 at @xmath18 if @xmath19 or a zero of multiplicity @xmath20 at @xmath18 if @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> we mention that a similar conformal factorization result was obtained by jeong and taniguchi @xcite in the case where @xmath0 is a proper holomorphic mapping from a finitely connected domain @xmath7 onto the unit disk @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> their main goal was to prove a conjecture of steven bell saying that every such domain @xmath7 is conformally equivalent to a domain of the form @xmath22 for some rational map @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> see also @xcite for a uniqueness statement and applications to analytic capacity and ahlfors functions .    </S>",
    "<S> theorem [ mainthm ] is proved in section 1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the degree of @xmath6 is best possible . </S>",
    "<S> it thus seems natural to expect that in conjecture  [ conjrichards ] , one can also obtain a conformal model for @xmath0 whose degree depends only on the maximal number of preimages under @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show in section  2 that this is not the case </S>",
    "<S> .    finally , in the last section of the paper , we use theorem [ mainthm ] to characterize the welding diffeomorphisms ( or fingerprints ) of _ polynomial pseudo - lemniscates _ , that is , analytic jordan curves of the form @xmath23 where @xmath3 is a polynomial and @xmath24 is an analytic jordan curve . </S>",
    "<S> this generalizes the main theorem of  @xcite . </S>"
