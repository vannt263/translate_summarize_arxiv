    "before ross geoghegan turned his attention to the main topic of these proceedings , _ topological methods in group theory _ , he was a leader in the area of shape theory .",
    "in fact , much of his pioneering work in geometric group theory has involved taking key ideas from shape theory and recasting them in the service of groups .",
    "some of his early thoughts on that point of view are captured nicely in @xcite . among the interesting ideas found in that 1986 paper",
    "is an early recognition that a group boundary is well - defined up to shape ",
    "an idea later formalized by bestvina in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we return to the subject of geoghegan s early work . for those whose",
    "interests lie primarily in group theory , the work presented here contains a concise and fairly gentle introduction to the ideas of shape theory , via a careful study of one of its foundational questions .    in the 1970 s d.a .",
    "edwards and r. geoghegan solved two open problems in shape theory  both related to the issue of stability . roughly speaking , these problems ask when a bad  space has the same shape as a good  space . for simplicity",
    ", we focus on the following versions of those problems :    * problem a. * _ give necessary and sufficient conditions for a connected finite - dimensional compactum _ @xmath0 _ _  to have the pointed shape of a cw complex . _ _    * problem b. * _ give necessary and sufficient conditions for a connected finite - dimensional compactum _ @xmath0 _ _  to have the pointed shape of a finite cw complex . _ _    solutions to these problems can be found in the sequence of papers : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a pair of particularly nice versions of those solutions are as follows :    * solution a. * @xmath0 _ _  has the pointed shape of a cw complex  if and only if each of its homotopy pro - groups is stable . _",
    "_    * solution b. * @xmath0 _ _  has the pointed shape of a finite cw complex  if and only if each of its homotopy pro - groups is stable and an intrinsically defined wall obstruction _ _",
    "@xmath1\\right )   $ ] _ vanishes .",
    "_    solution b was obtained by combining solution a with c.t.c .",
    "famous work on finite homotopy types @xcite .",
    "so , in order to understand edwards and geoghegan s solution to problem b , it is necessary to understand two things : solution a ; and wall s work on the finiteness obstruction .",
    "since both tasks are substantial  and since problem b can arise quite naturally without regards to problem a  we became interested in finding a simpler and more direct solution to problem b. this note contains such a solution .",
    "this paper may be viewed as a sequel to @xcite , where geoghegan presented a new and more elementary solution to problem a. in the same spirit , we feel that our work offers a simplified view of problem b.    the strategy we use in attacking problem b is straightforward and very natural .",
    "given a connected @xmath2-dimensional pointed compactum @xmath0 , begin with an inverse system @xmath3 of finite @xmath2-dimensional ( pointed ) complexes with ( pointed ) cellular bonding maps that represents @xmath0 .",
    "under the assumption that @xmath4-@xmath5 is stable for all @xmath6 , we borrow a technique from @xcite allowing us to attach cells to the @xmath7 s so that the bonding maps induce @xmath5-isomorphisms for increasingly large @xmath6 . our goal then is to reach a _ finite _ stage where the bonding maps induce @xmath5-isomorphisms for all @xmath6 , and are therefore homotopy equivalences .",
    "this would imply that @xmath0 has the shape of any of those homotopy equivalent finite complexes .",
    "as expected , we confront an obstruction lying in the reduced projective class group of @xmath4-@xmath8 . instead of invoking theorems from @xcite",
    ", we uncover this obstruction in the natural context of the problem at hand ; in fact , the main result of @xcite can then be obtained as a corollary .",
    "another advantage to the approach taken here is that all cw complexes used in this paper are finite .",
    "this makes both the algebra and the shape theory more elementary .",
    "in this section we provide some background information on inverse systems , inverse sequences , and shape theory . in addition , we will review the definition of a reduced projective class group .",
    "a more complete treatment of inverse systems and sequences can be found in @xcite ; an expanded version of this introduction can be found in @xcite      we provide a brief discussion of general inverse systems and pro - categories , which provide the broad framework for more concrete constructions that will follow .",
