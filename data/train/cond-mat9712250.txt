    "wave propagation through a random passive medium is being studied intensively over several decades@xcite .",
    "it is now well established that coherent interference effects , due to elastic scattering by the static disorder , induces anderson localization for quantum as well as classical waves .",
    "some physical examples are electron transport in disordered conductors , light or electro - magnetic wave propagation in random dielectric media , sound propagation in an inhomogeneous elastic medium , etc .",
    "these qualitatively different types of waves in an appropriate limit follow the same mathematical equation , namely , the helmholtz equation .",
    "thus studies on different types of wave propagation complement each other .",
    "it is basically the wave character leading to interference and diffraction which is the common operative feature .",
    "coherent multiple scattering of a wave from a fixed spatial realization of randomly distributed scatterers generates an interference pattern in space which is very sensitive to the actual distribution of scatterers .",
    "small relative displacement of scatterers , of the order of a fraction of a wavelength , can alter completely the interference pattern . specifically in the context of quantum electron transport in one dimensional random media this will make the resistance ( or the transmittance ) a non - self averaging quantity @xcite in that the resistance fluctuations over the ensemble of macroscopically identical samples dominate the ensemble average , root mean square variation of sample to sample fluctuations in the resistance over all the realizations of the macroscopically identical samples exceeds the mean value by orders of magnitude no matter how large the sample is .",
    "the inelastic scattering ( due to phonons or other quasi - particles ) lead to loss of phase memory of the wave function .",
    "thus the motion of electrons becomes phase incoherent and sample to sample fluctuations become self - averaging in the high temperature limit leading to a classical behavior . in recent years",
    "the study of wave propagation in an active random medium @xcite , , in the presence of absorption or amplification , is being pursued actively .",
    "the light propagation in an amplifying ( lasing ) medium has its implications for stimulated emission from random media . in a stimulated emission photons emitted",
    "will have the same frequency , phase , direction , and polarization .",
    "this will result in spatial and temporal coherence of laser light propagation .",
    "the absorption in the medium corresponds to the actual removal of the particle ( or energy in the case of electro - magnetic wave propagation ) by re - combination processes .",
    "for example propagation of optical ( excitons ) or magnetic excitations in solids which terminate upon reaching trapping sites . to allow for the possibility of inelastic decay on the otherwise coherent tunneling through potential barriers",
    "several studies invoke absorption@xcite . in the presence of inelastic scattering due to thermal excitations , electrons are scattered out of elastic channel to other inelastic channels . in these studies",
    "the absorption is identified as the spectral weight lost in the inelastic channels . as an example , in the case of one - dimensional double barrier structures the absorbed or attenuated part is assumed to tunnel through both the left and the right hand sides of the barriers in proportion to the transmission coefficient of each barrier , and this is added to the coherent transmission to get the overall transmission coefficient @xcite . in the electro - magnetic wave propagation",
    "the bosonic nature of photons brings in both features , namely that of amplification as well as attenuation . photons obey bose statistics and their number is not conserved .",
    "thus one can consider a problem of wave propagation in a coherently amplifying ( or absorbing ) optical medium . in the schrdinger equation , to describe the absorption or amplification , one introduces the imaginary potentials . in that case",
    "the hamiltonian becomes non - hermitian and thus the particle number is not conserved .",
    "such hamiltonians are widely used in nuclear physics literature and the corresponding imaginary potentials are called optical potentials . the absorption or amplification for the case of light propagation is simulated via the imaginary part of the dielectric constant with opposite signs .",
    "it should be noted that in quenched random systems with imaginary potentials the temporal coherence of the wave is preserved in spite of amplification or absorption which causes a particle non - conserving scattering process .",
    "almost all the studies reported so far have considered a linear amplifying or absorbing medium , irrespective of the fact that real problem of laser oscillations and mode selection in an optically pumped random medium requires consideration of non - linearities @xcite . in all these studies",
    "the basic issue is to understand the interplay of phase coherent multiple scattering and amplification ( or absorption ) .",
    "several new results have been obtained from the studies of wave propagation in an active medium . in earlier studies",
    "it has been widely thought that the effect of absorption on classical waves is analogous to that of inelastic scattering of electrons .",
    "weaver@xcite has shown that absorption does not provide a cut - off length scale ( similar to an inelastic scattering length ) for the renormalization of wave transport in the random medium .",
    "in other words , the absorption does not re - establish the diffusive behavior of the wave propagation by destroying the localization of eigenfunctions .",
    "the transport seems to remain non - diffusive even in the presence of absorption .",
    "this fact will have an important bearing on the physics at the mobility edge in higher dimensional ( 3-d ) systems . in a related development",
    "it has been shown that absorption along with enhanced reflection induces coherence in quantum systems@xcite . in a scattering problem , the particle experiences a mismatch from the real valued potential to the imaginary valued potential at the interface between the free region and the absorbing ( or amplifying ) medium , and hence it tries to avoid this region by enhanced back reflection .",
    "thus a dual role is played by imaginary potentials as an absorber ( or amplifier ) and as a reflector .",
    "this point has been emphasized in earlier treatments@xcite .",
    "one can readily show that , when the strength of the imaginary potential is increased beyond certain limit , both absorber and amplifying scatterer act as a reflector .",
    "thus the reflection coefficient exhibits non - monotonic behavior as a function of the absorption ( amplification ) strength . using the duality relations",
    "it has been shown that amplification suppresses the transmittance in the large length ( l ) limit just as much as absorption does @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat contrary to the expectation .",
    "one would have expected that as a wave passes through a disordered amplifying medium it undergoes coherent multiple scattering and hence gets amplified before it escapes from the system .",
    "it turns out that coherent amplification in turn induces localization by enhancement of the coherent backscattering involving longer return paths , thereby cutting off transmission .",
    "experimentally this reflects in a narrowing of the backscattering cone in random amplifying medium @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed @xcite that there exists a crossover length scale @xmath0 below which the amplification enhances the transmission and above which the amplification reduces the transmission which , in fact , vanishes exponentially in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "in contrast , super - radiant reflectance saturates to a finite value in the large length limit . moreover , absorption and amplification of same strength ( , differing only in the sign of the imaginary part ) will induce same localization length @xcite .",
    "even for an ordered periodic system in the presence of coherent amplification , the transmittance always decreases in the asymptotic length limit @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that the amplifier also acts as a back - scatterer ( or reflector ) as mentioned above . to obtain enhanced coherent transmittance ,",
    "the synergy between wave confinement due to anderson localization and coherent amplification by active medium is not necessary . by a proper choice of a length of an ordered amplifying medium one can achieve large transmittance",
    "however , for a finite sample of length @xmath2 to obtain enhanced reflection the synergy between disorder and amplification plays a major role .    in an amplifying medium even though the transmittance ( @xmath3 ) decreases exponentially with the length @xmath2 in the large @xmath2 limit , the average @xmath4 is shown@xcite to be infinite due to the less probable resonant realizations corresponding to the non gaussian tail of the distribution of @xmath5 .",
    "this result is based on the analysis using random phase approximation ( rpa ) . using",
    "duality argument paasschens show that non - gaussian tails in the distribution of @xmath6 contain negligible weight@xcite .",
    "thus one might expect finite value for @xmath4 in the asymptotic limit .",
    "it should be noted that even in the ordered periodic system all the states are resonant states and still the transmittance decreases exponentially for all the states in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the above simple case may indicate that in the asymptotic limit @xmath4 is indeed finite .",
    "one of our objectives in this paper is to study ( numerically ) the behavior of the transmission probability as a function of length in the presence of coherent amplification .",
    "we show that the transmission coefficient is a non - self - averaging quantity . in the large length limit",
    "we do not find any resonant realization , which can give an enhanced transmission .",
    "we also study the behavior the of cross - over length @xmath0 as a function of disorder and amplification strength .",
    "as mentioned earlier , upto the cross - over length @xmath0 transmittance increases and after @xmath0 it falls exponentially .",
    "we have studied the logarithm of the transmittance which will have a maximum value @xmath7 at @xmath0 .",
    "we have analyzed the behavior of @xmath7 as a function of disorder and amplification strength .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in the lasing medium the presence of disorder suppresses the average transmittance at all length scales in comparison with the ordered media having the same strength of amplification .",
    "for a given strength of amplification there exists a critical strength of disorder below which the average transmittance is always less than unity at all length scales and decreases monotonically . in this regime @xmath0 and @xmath7 loose their physical significance . yet in this regime",
    "we show that there exists a cross - over length scale @xmath8 which diverges as the amplification strength is reduced to zero for a given strength of the disorder . in the case of super reflection in the presence of disorder",
    "we show that there exists a cross - over length @xmath9 below which the averaged logarithm of reflectance , @xmath10 , is always less than @xmath11 for the periodic ( @xmath12 ) lasing ( @xmath13 ) system .",
    "@xmath9 depends on disorder and amplification strength .",
    "below @xmath9 , @xmath10 is always larger than that for the ordered lasing medium .",
    "however , there is another disorder dependent length scale @xmath14 . for a system of size less than @xmath9 disorder enhances the reflection whereas for sizes between @xmath15 and @xmath9 disorder suppresses the reflection .    in the work by pradhan and kumar@xcite , the analytical expression for the stationary distribution @xmath16 of a coherently backscattered reflection coefficient @xmath17",
    "is obtained in the presence of both absorption and amplification using the method of invariant imbedding@xcite . in the presence of a spatially uniform amplification in a random medium and with the help of random phase approximation , the expression for @xmath16",
    "is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the strength of amplifying potential and disorder respectively .",
    "one can readily notice from eqn .",
    "( [ prad ] ) that @xmath16 does not tend to @xmath23 in the large @xmath21 limit . in this limit , as mentioned earlier , an amplifying scatterer acts as a reflector . instead , eqn .",
    "( [ prad ] ) indicates that as @xmath19 increases the distribution becomes broad and the most probable value of the reflection coefficient shifts to higher values .",
    "since the above expression for @xmath16 is obtained within the rpa , its validity is limited for small disorder and amplification strength . even in the absence of amplification",
    "it is well known that rpa fails in the large disorder limit@xcite . in the presence of small disorder",
    "it is shown that absorption suppresses phase fluctuations making the regime of validity of rpa still smaller in the parameter space of disorder and absorption@xcite .",
    "we show that this is true also in the presence of spatially uniform amplification . from eqn .",
    "( [ prad ] ) it follows that the average reflection coefficient @xmath24 is infinite .    with the help of transfer matrix approach",
    "we have studied the distribution and statistics of the transmittance @xmath3 from which the non - self - averaging nature of @xmath3 follows .",
    "we then study the behavior of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , @xmath15 and @xmath7 on the material parameters .",
    "the probability distribution of the reflection coefficient @xmath25 tends to a stationary distribution @xmath16 in the large @xmath2 limit . for a small disorder @xmath22 and small amplification @xmath21",
    ", @xmath16 is qualitatively in conformity with eqn .",
    "( [ prad ] ) .",
    "as we increase @xmath21 , a double peak structure appears in @xmath16 and as we increase @xmath21 further , @xmath16 tends towards @xmath23 .",
    "the average of @xmath11 obtained from @xmath16 exhibits maxima as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "we also show that amplification suppresses the phase fluctuation of the complex reflection amplitude . in the next section",
    "we define our model hamiltonian and transfer matrix approach .",
    "later sections are devoted to results and conclusions .",
    "we consider a quasi - particle moving on a lattice .",
    "the appropriate hamiltonian in a tight - binding one - band model can be written as    @xmath26    @xmath27 is the off - diagonal matrix element connecting nearest neighbors separated by a lattice spacing @xmath28 ( taken to be unity throughout ) and @xmath29 is the non - degenerate wannier orbital associated with site @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the site energy .",
    "the real part of the site energy @xmath32 being random represents static disorder and @xmath32 at different sites are assumed to be uncorrelated random variables distributed uniformly ( @xmath33 ) over the range @xmath34 to @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath22 can be interpreted as the strength of the disorder .",
    "we have taken imaginary part of the site energy @xmath21 to be spatially uniform and depending on whether the medium is amplifying or absorbing , it is set to positive or negative values .",
    "since all the relevant energies can be scaled by @xmath27 , we can set @xmath27 to unity .",
    "the lasing medium consisting of @xmath36 sites ( @xmath37 to @xmath36 ) is embedded in a perfect infinite lattice with all site energies taken to be zero .",
    "in our studies we have set the energy of the incident particle at @xmath53 , , at a midband energy .",
    "any other value for the incident energy does not affect the physics of the problem .",
    "in calculating average values in all cases we have taken 10,000 realizations of random site energies ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "the numerical value of @xmath121 depends on the material parameters . for the value @xmath122 , the amplifying medium acts dominantly as a reflector .",
    "it should be noted that the double peak structure in @xmath16 appears for values of @xmath21 close to @xmath121 . for a given amount of disorder and for @xmath123",
    "the increase in reflectance ( beyond unity ) as function of @xmath21 is due to the presence of disorder along with amplification .",
