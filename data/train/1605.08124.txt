    "in this supplemental material , we describe how classically measured lyapunov exponent of a deterministic chaos can be related to the out - of - time - ordered correlators for quantum fields . in particular , our lyapunov exponent measured in the linear sigma model and in the motion of the d7-branes in the gravity dual side can be written as a version of the out - of - time - ordered correlators .    as briefly described in the main part of the paper , recent development in quantum chaos and ads / cft",

    "the important conjecture of @xcite is the upper bound for the lyapunov exponent @xmath139 for the out - of - time - ordered correlator which is properly regularized . in this supplemental material",
    "we provide how our lyapunov exponent calculated in the gravity dual can be written as a version of this out - of - time - ordered correlator .      before a presentation of the precise relation between our results and the out - os - time - ordered correlators , it is instructive to have a brief review of how can be related to a classical chaos in the semiclassical limit @xcite based on the argument in @xcite . consider a classical particle motion where the location of the particle at time @xmath133 is given by @xmath140 .",

    "the classical chaos means the exponential growth of a tiny difference at the initial conditions , @xmath142 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath143 is the initial difference of the position of the particle .",
    "the growth rate is given by the lyapunov exponent @xmath130 , and the factor @xmath144 ( and the square in the left hand side ) is just for a later purpose .",
    "the left hand side can be re - written by a poisson bracket , @xmath145 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , when one goes to a quantum mechanical regime , the poisson bracket is replaced by a commutator @xmath146 $ ] .",

    "since it is solvable , one can evaluate the operator commutation explicitly .",
    "we start with a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath148 then it is easy to calculate the relevant commutator of the operators in the heisenberg representation , @xmath149 = \\cos[\\omega(t_2-t_1 ) ] \\ , .",

    ", we can take a pure imaginary @xmath158 . in this inverse harmonic oscillator ,",
    "a lyapunov exponent can be computed , though the system is not really chaotic because the classical motion is not bounded .",
    "nevertheless , it would be instructive to see how the exponential growth rate @xmath159 can be detected by the quantum operator commutator and the classical analysis of the deviation .",

    "normally for classical chaos one does not introduce the temperature @xmath162 : the growth rate is calculated by a classical deterministic motion of @xmath140 for a given set of initial conditions . for the initial conditions , one needs to provide energy since it is normally conserved for hamiltonian systems .",
    "therefore the classical lyapunov exponent is a function of energy , rather than the temperature . from this argument",
    ", we notice that the classical chaos is normally given by a micro canonical ensemble ( which is specified by an energy ) while the chaos measured by in @xcite is given by a canonical ensemble ( which is specified by a temperature ) .",
    "crudely speaking , the temperature @xmath162 determines the rough energy scale of excited states , so one could say that the energy @xmath163 .",

    ", this finite number @xmath170 can be arbitrarily large , which provides the infinite variety of classical initial conditions for a given energy @xmath29 .",
    "the moduli @xmath137 in needs to be understood as this degeneracy . for the harmonic oscillator ,",
    "any given quantum energy level @xmath167 , the state is not degenerate .",
    "however , for a given classical energy @xmath29 , there are infinitely many quantum states , and superposition of all of them gives rise to the classical initial condition @xmath156 . ]",
    "as described earlier , our out - of - time - ordered correlator is evaluated by @xmath136 , which is a state in a micro canonical ensemble . to make a connection to the thermal ensemble",
    ", we need to sum over all states with the canonical weight @xmath171 $ ] where @xmath29 is the energy density and @xmath20 is the spatial volume of the system",

    "the classical lyapunov exponent @xmath130 in depends on @xmath29 and @xmath137 , so substituting into this expression shows @xmath174 \\exp [ 2l(e,{\\cal m } ) t ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , the thermal lyapunov exponent @xmath175 studied in @xcite could be related to the classical lyapunov exponent @xmath176 as @xmath177 \\exp [ 2l(e,{\\cal m } ) t ] \\biggm ]   \\ , .",
    "\\label{rel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the relation between the lyapunov exponent @xmath176 of our classical evaluation and the thermal lyapunov exponent @xmath175 given by the out - of - time - ordered correlator . in general , there is no simple analytic expression for the explicit relation",
    ". grows linearly in @xmath29 , the thermal weight @xmath178 $ ] can not make the energy integral convergent , and the integral itself is not well - defined .",
    "therefore , the powers in @xmath29 appearing in the classical lyapunov exponent seems to be bounded from above : @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",
    "this condition may be regarded as a classical version of the bound . ]",
    "let us start with the @xmath12 model example .",
    "the @xmath12 model consists of the meson fields @xmath12 and @xmath37 , and their conjugate operators are given by @xmath181 there are various ways to define the  distance \" between two orbits in the phase space of the @xmath12 model , but we adopted simply the distance in @xmath26 for given two initial conditions , because we are interested in the chiral condensates .",
    "then , our lyapunov exponent for the chiral condensate is written as @xmath182 ^ 2   | e , { \\cal m }   \\right\\rangle \\biggm|   \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can argue an evaluation of once a model is given . in the case of our @xmath12 model , as we have observed in figure .  3",
    ", the lyapunov exponent is nonzero only for a limited region in the energy scan .",
    "so , let us simply assume that the region is very narrow and the lyapunov exponent is nonzero only at a certain energy density @xmath183 .",
    "then effectively the energy integration in the right hand side of is evaluated for the limited region ( a delta function @xmath184 ) , and we obtain @xmath185 so the thermal lyapunov exponent is equal to our classical lyapunov exponent at the region .",
    "let us discuss the meaning of in view of the bound .",
    "although the bound for @xmath175 is for a properly regularized four - point function which is different from @xmath186 ^ 2 $ ] used above , it may be instructive to discuss how the bound could be consistent .",
    "it appears that contradicts with the bound for a small temperature .",
    "but notice that a possible  violation \" needs a very small temperature comparable to @xmath187 and thus the classical evaluation of the lyapunov exponent is not validated .",
    "let us argue this a bit more in detail .",
    "the quantum time evolution is by a unitary operator @xmath188 $ ] , thus the validity of the classical picture is for @xmath189 .",
    "we are looking at the lyapunov growth , so the time scale is @xmath190 . using this",
    ", the classical analysis needs @xmath191 .",
    "suppose the lyapunov exponent is constant .",
    "then a violation of the bound needs a low temperature @xmath192 .",
    "together with the classical validity , we obtain @xmath193 .",
    "this means that the thermal weight @xmath164 $ ] is highly suppressed for this temperature , so it can not appear in perturbation theory : the thermal sum in at such a low temperature could be overwhelmed by other perturbative corrections .",
    "therefore , the  violation \" is not an immediate conclusion , we need more careful quantum treatment of the evaluation of the thermal partitions .    in this paper we considered a homogeneous time - dependent field configuration of the mesons , but in general the mesons are inhomogeneous .",
    "the operators in the expression is naturally evaluated at the same position in the three - dimensional space . in qcd",
    "chiral perturbation , there are some study of homogeneous meson configurations , which is called @xmath194-regime @xcite . in this @xmath194-regime , the volume @xmath20 is taken to zero .",
    "however , @xmath195 can not be so small if we rely on classical treatment , as mentioned above : @xmath196 is necessary .",
    "let us briefly discuss the out - of - time - ordered correlator for our main example of the @xmath4 supersymmetric qcd .",
    "the discussion is the same except for the difference of the operators .",
    "the operators for which we measured the lyapunov exponent are @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is defined in a similar manner , @xmath199 ^ 2   | e , { \\cal m }   \\right\\rangle \\biggm|   \\ , .",

    "5 shows that for fixed @xmath13 and @xmath0 the lyapunov exponent grows as we increase the energy density @xmath29 .",
    "evaluation of the thermal lyapunov exponent through needs an analytic functional form of @xmath200 and also the density of state .",
