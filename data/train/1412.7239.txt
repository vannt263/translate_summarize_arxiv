    "since the first observation of a nuclear rainbow in elastic @xmath4 particle scattering from @xmath5ni @xcite , the importance of the concept of rainbow scattering in studies of nuclear reactions and structures has been widely understood @xcite .",
    "the interaction potential can be determined without discrete ambiguity up to the internal region by studying rainbow scattering because refraction carries information from the inner region .",
    "the nuclear rainbow has been observed under weak absorption in many systems and has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the uniquely determined interaction potential made it possible to study the cluster structure of the compound system above and below the threshold energy by unifying unbound and bound states as typically shown for the @xmath4+@xmath0o and @xmath4+@xmath6ca systems @xcite .",
    "the nuclear rainbow has also been observed for typical heavy ion systems such as @xmath0o+@xmath0o , @xmath0o+@xmath1c and @xmath1c+@xmath1c , for which the higher order airy structure has been clearly observed @xcite .",
    "the interaction potential uniquely determined for the most typical @xmath0o+@xmath0o system made it possible to understand the superdeformed @xmath0o+@xmath0o cluster structure in @xmath7s and the nuclear rainbow in a unified way @xcite .",

    "the airy structure in inelastic scattering has been studied @xcite .",
    "inelastic rainbow scattering has also been especially powerful in understanding the highly excited cluster structure near and above the threshold energy , such as the @xmath4 particle condensation of the hoyle state in @xmath1c and the hoyle - analog state in @xmath0o @xcite .",
    "a recent systematic study of the evolution of the airy structure in inelastic scattering for the typical @xmath4+@xmath0o system @xcite showed that the cluster structure with core excitation in @xmath9ne near the threshold energy region and the inelastic nuclear rainbow scattering can be understood in a unified way by using reliable interaction potentials for the inelastic channels .",
    "this urges us to study inelastic rainbow scattering with heavy ions in order to determine the interaction potentials in inelastic channels , which will make it possible to understand the molecular structure with core excitation , for which phenomenological shallow potentials have been used widely instead of a deep potential @xcite .    for heavy ion systems ,",

    "<S> inelastic @xmath0o + @xmath1c rainbow scattering to the @xmath2 ( 4.44 mev ) state of @xmath1c was measured at the incident energies , @xmath3 = 170 , 181 , 200 , 260 and 281 mev . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic analysis of the experimental angular distributions was performed using the coupled channels method with an extended double folding potential derived from realistic wave functions for @xmath1c and @xmath0o calculated with a microscopic @xmath4 cluster model and a finite - range density - dependent nucleon - nucleon force . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled channels analysis of the measured inelastic scattering data shows consistently some airy - like structure in the inelastic scattering cross sections for the first @xmath2 state of @xmath1c , which is somewhat obscured and still not clearly visible in the measured data . </S>",
    "<S> the airy minimum was identified from the analysis and the systematic energy evolution of the airy structure was studied . </S>",
    "<S> the airy minimum in inelastic scattering is found to be shifted backward compared with that in elastic scattering . </S>"
