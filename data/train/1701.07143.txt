    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism ( see  @xcite for a review ) is an effective field theory approach to qcd at small @xmath0 where the gluon density in a proton or nucleus is expected to be so large that the standard qcd - improved parton model must break down . in this limit",
    "it is more appropriate to treat the hadron or nucleus as a coherent color field rather than a collection of incoherent and individual partons . at the classical level , the cgc generalizes scattering via exchange of a single gluon to multiple gluon exchanges ( high energy factorization ) . by including quantum loop effects",
    ", it resums the large logs of bjorken @xmath0  @xcite ( or equivalently energy ) as opposed to the leading twist collinear factorization formalism which resums large logs of the hard scale @xmath1 .",
    "the color glass condensate formalism is the appropriate one to use in the kinematic limit where @xmath2 .",
    "this is typically the case for particle production in the low to intermediate @xmath3 regime and in the forward rapidity region  @xcite where one probes the small @xmath0 components of the target wave function . +",
    "the color glass condensate formalism has been applied to various high energy processes . a first class of observables is associated with the forward hadron production at rhic and the lhc ( see @xcite for a compilation of lhc forward physics observables and @xcite for a compilation of the cgc - motivated phenomenology of particle production ) .",
    "while there are strong hints for the presence of gluon saturation effects in the observed suppression of forward hadron production cross section at rhic and the lhc  @xcite , the effect is far from being universally accepted as coming only from saturation .",
    "models which modify the parton distribution functions of nuclei and add energy loss effects have also been used to fit the data  @xcite .",
    "azimuthal angular correlations of produced di - hadrons have also been measured ( in deuteron - gold collisions ) and show a strong decorrelation of the azimuthal angle between the two produced hadrons in the forward rapidity region as predicted in the cgc formalism  @xcite .",
    "the away side peak is observed to be broader which can be understood to be due to multiple scattering .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the peak is reduced which is due to the small @xmath0 evolution of the target wave function which causes nuclear shadowing .",
    "various angular correlations have also been suggested as possible probes of gluon saturation in the target  @xcite .",
    "they all exhibit the same qualitative features in the cgc formalism which will be further probed by the current experiments at the lhc and in the proposed electron - ion collider  @xcite .",
    "+ while much can be learned from hadron - hadron collisions , observables generally suffer from contaminations due to soft and collinear radiation .",
    "a much cleaner environment  both experimentally and theoretically  is , on the other hand , provided by photon induced processes .",
    "while much has been learned from the study of proton structure functions measured at the hera experiment , ultra - peripheral collisions ( upcs ) of protons on protons and nuclei on protons at the lhc , allow to study the currently most energetic photon - proton collisions , where either a large nucleus or a proton serve as the photon source . among the most prominent observables explored so far",
    "is exclusive photo - production process of vector mesons such as the @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such processes are of particular interest since they allow to probe the gluon distribution in the proton down to very small values of bjorken @xmath5 , see @xcite for cgc - related studies .",
    "while such cgc studies provide an excellent description of the energy dependence of the exclusive @xmath4 photo - production cross - section , the same energy dependence has also an excellent description in terms of ( dilute ) next - to - leading order bfkl evolution ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) which , unlike the cgc - formalism , does not include corrections due to high densities . from a theoretical point of view the difficulty to distinguish low @xmath0 evolution without ( bfkl ) and with ( bk , jimwlk )",
    "is related to the type of correlators probed by such observables : both proton structure functions and the amplitude for exclusive photo - production of vector mesons are directly proportional to the two - point correlator of two wilson lines , which itself can be related to an unintegrated gluon density .",
    "the description of such observables is therefore at first identical for low ( bfkl ) and high ( bk , jimwlk ) densities and the presence of high density effects only manifests itself through the particular form of low @xmath0 evolution . finding definite evidence for saturation effects requires therefore evolution of the observables far into the low @xmath0 region , well beyond the kinematical reach of current collider experiments .",
    "+ in  @xcite we proposed triple jet / hadron production in dis as an excellent probe of gluon saturation dynamics in a hadron or nucleus . unlike the observables discussed above , the theoretical description of observables with multiple final states involves higher order correlators of wilson lines in the target .",
    "as a consequence high density effects manifest themselves directly at the level of the observable without the need to invoke low @xmath0 evolution .",
    "in particular there are substantial differences between a bfkl / low density and a cgc / high density description . while the measurement of such high multiplicity final states is much more cumbersome",
    "experimentally , such observables provide important complementary information to inclusive observables , and therefore allow to pin down the valid description of perturbative qcd in the low @xmath0 region .",
    "the case of three jet / hadron production is then of particular interest , since such an observable provides two relative angles rather than one in the case of two - particle correlations , so there is an additional knob to turn .",
    "furthermore there are two away side peaks , each of which will sensitively depend on saturation dynamics and small @xmath0 evolution .",
    "we showed our final expression for the triple differential cross section in  @xcite and used it to study , quantitatively , the angular dependence of the cross section in certain kinematics .",
    "the present paper is dedicated to a presentation of the full details of the calculation , employing spinor helicity formalism ( for introductory reviews see  @xcite ) which leads to a major simplification of the calculation . for",
    "another recent application of the spinor helicity formalism in the framework of light - cone wave function see @xcite ; for a related calculation of 3 parton impact factor in dis in the shock wave framework see also @xcite ; see also the calculation of next - to - leading corrections to inclusive dis of @xcite .",
    "+ this paper is organized in the following way : we write down the formal expressions for the production amplitude in section [ sec : ampl - moment ] and proceed to study the space - time structure of the diagrams in section [ sec : cut - diagr - accord ] and [ sec : further - reduction ] .",
    "various cuts of the diagrams are considered and shown to lead to vanishing of some diagrams due to the wrong cut .",
    "this allows us to re - write the expressions for the amplitude in a more compact way .",
    "we then give an overview of the spinor helicity formalism in section [ sec : helic - spin - meth ] and proceed to apply it to the process considered .",
    "major simplifications occur when one considers scattering and production of partons of a fixed helicity due to helicity conservation .",
    "we summarize in section [ sec : summary ] and , using crossing symmetry , point out the connections between our results and multi - parton scattering ( mpi ) in the projectile , in photon - jet or photon production in forward rapidity proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "we consider production of three partons in dis as depicted in fig .",

    "the method becomes inefficient due to the large number of feynman diagrams which need to be considered .",
    "while the process @xmath34 target @xmath35 requires 3 diagrams , one finds already 16 diagrams for the process @xmath34",
    "target @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , calculations based on configuration space propagators suggest a large redundancy in the result , leading to large cancellations among different diagrams , which further complicate the use of momentum space methods . in the following",
    "we demonstrate that there is a direct way to use the emerging simplicity of the configuration space amplitudes for calculations in momentum space .      to achieve the required reduction of feynman diagrams it is necessary to exploit the restriction of the interaction between projectile and target to the light - cone time - slice @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "such properties are naturally revealed in the configuration space and/or light - front formalism , which is the main reason for their preferred use over momentum space techniques . to make these properties and the associated reduction of diagrams explicit in momentum space , it is sufficient to associate with each propagator a separate minus - momentum variable .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing at each ( standard qcd ) vertex ( where minus - momenta are conserved _",
    "i.e. _ , excluding the vertices in eqs .   and )",

    "using such propagators together with integrations over light - cone times @xmath49 at each vertex one re - obtains directly the light - cone time ordered feynman rules of light - front perturbation theory ( old - fashioned perturbation theory ) , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite which contains a recent and compact overview .",
    "in particular we find that it is natural to organize qcd interaction vertices into vertices before ( @xmath50 ) and after the interaction ( @xmath51 ) with the target field . in a nut - shell",
    "this result will allow us to evaluate to zero configurations which are absent in the light - front formalism for momentum space diagrams , simplifying enormously the reduction of diagrams at earlier stages of the calculation .",
    "+ to be more precise , we first note that potential contact terms in the quark ( @xmath52 ) and gluon ( @xmath53 ) propagators are absent , if the propagators connect with the vertices eqs .   and : for the quark due to the identity @xmath54 , for the gluon since @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( if the vertex connects to a virtual gluon ) and @xmath57 ( if the vertex connects to a real gluon ) .",
    "due to the absence of such contact terms it will be sufficient to limit the discussion to scalar skeleton diagrams , independent of the precise nature of particles .",
    "we further note that plus momenta are conserved at all vertices ( including eqs .   and ) .",
    "on the other hand , since plus coordinates and plus momenta are the only components which receive special constraints from the propagators in the representation of eq .  , it is sufficient to study only their effect .",
    "the resulting diagrams are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : real ] , where for the time being we ignore the presence of potential target interaction vertices eqs .   and .    in a next step",
    "we divide all integrals over light - cone times @xmath43 into a positive @xmath58 and a negative @xmath59 sector .",
    "while this is motivated by the restriction of the target interaction vertices to light - cone time @xmath60 , this is irrelevant for the following reason .",
    "using now that propagation from a vertex with negative light - cone time @xmath61 to a positive light - cone time @xmath51 implies @xmath62 and therefore positive light - cone momentum @xmath63 ( due to the structure of theta - functions in eq .  ) , it is straight forward to verify that each skeleton diagram can be organized according to three possible `` @xmath64-channel '' cuts , see fig .",
    "[ fig : real_sliced ] .",
    "+    it is easily possible to extend our result to the case of @xmath31 final state particles : crossing from negative to positive light - cone times requires positive light - cone momentum and  vice versa  crossing from positive to negative light - cone times requires negative light - cone momentum . in the case of a tree skeleton diagram ,",
    "all light - cone momenta are always positive and therefore crossing from positive to negative light - cone times is impossible .",
    "moreover , once a certain line crosses from the negative to the positive light - cone time sector , all its daughter lines , _",
    "i.e. _ , lines emerging from a splitting of this line , will have positive light - cone times by default .",
    "the resulting picture tells us that each individual diagram is characterized by all possible vertical lines through the diagrams ( ` @xmath64-channel ' cuts ) which indicate transition from negative to positive light - cone time .",
    "+ the benefit of this result for the study of the interaction with the target field should be apparent by now : since vertices , eqs .   and , are limited to light - cone time @xmath65 , such vertices can only be inserted in a `` cut '' line .",
    "insertions in un - cut lines , are immediately zero , see fig .",
    "[ fig : illegal ] for two configurations which can not occur .",
    "note that this result applies separately for each individual feynman diagram and holds regardless of whether the actual evaluation takes place in configuration , momentum or mixed _ i.e. _ light - front space .",
    "while this leads already to a significant reduction in the number of feynman diagrams to be evaluated , the remaining set of diagrams still contains a sizable fraction of redundant contributions .",
    "in particular there are large cancellations between diagrams where we place a target interaction vertex eqs .",
    ", at the @xmath66 cut and diagrams where such interaction is absent , see fig .  [",
    "fig : cut_ex ] for an example .",
    "+              to reduce the number of diagrams further , it is necessary to study the fourier transform of the complete propagators ( containing both interacting and non - interacting ) parts , eq .  .",
    "using these propagators for all lines in diagrams ( for external lines this implies the use of the lsz - reduction procedure , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) the full process can be represented in terms of two diagrams only . on the level of scalar skeleton graphs these are precisely those of fig .",
    "[ fig : real ] .",
