    "the new generation of `` gradient corrected '' density functionals have been shown to yield remarkably accurate thermochemistries for organic systems@xcite .",
    "applications to inorganic complexes are less extensive , but those studies which have been reported are very encouraging@xcite .",
    "we have recently developed a dft code @xcite and applied it to the excitation and ionization energies of the atoms of the first transition series .",
    "the becke exchange functional @xcite coupled with the lee - yang - parr correlation functional @xcite , the ( b - lyp ) functional , gave exceptional results for the ionization energies ( mean errors of @xmath9 ev ) and acceptable results for excitation energies ( mean errors of @xmath10ev ) .",
    "we were therefore interested in the predictions of gradient - corrected dft for a `` simple '' series of ionic complexes , the transition metal fluorides : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "experimental geometries and bond energies are in hand for the first three members of this series , thereby allowing a study of the accuracy of the results as a function of basis set and functional , while the last one , @xmath3 , has been the subject of considerable controversy in recent years . on the experimental side , the debate centers about whether the vibrational spectrum observed by hope , et al.@xcite , and used by them to assign @xmath11 symmetry to @xmath3 , indeed corresponds to @xmath3 , or is actually the signature of @xmath12@xcite .",
    "the debate among theorists centers around the relative stability of the @xmath11 isomer relative to a trigonal prismatic geometry of @xmath13 symmetry @xcite .",
    "early calculations preferred the @xmath13 structure but the most recent and extensive calculations suggest that the @xmath11 isomer is the more stable .",
    "we present here the results of calculations on this series using both a local density approximation(lda ) and the gradient - corrected b - lyp approximation .",
    "the local density approximation comprises the slater exchange functional and the vosko - wilks - nusair parameterization of the electron gas correlation energy ( s - vwn ) .",
    "hartree - fock calculations were also performed for comparision .",
    "our results show that the b - lyp approximation yields reasonable binding energies for the transition metal fluorides using modest basis sets , but tends to overbind by 810 kcal / mol per bond . we have also investigated a hybrid hf / dft method due to becke ( the becke3lyp method ) @xcite , and have found this to yield very good results ( errors of the order of @xmath7 kcal / mol per bond ) .",
    "the calculations support the claims that the octahedral structure of @xmath3 is of lower energy than the trigonal prismatic structure , our best calculation ( becke3lyp ) favoring the octahedral structure by 14 kcal / mol .",
    "the dft calculations were carried out using the mesa suite of programs@xcite , into which we recently added dft modules@xcite .",
    "the kohn - sham procedure used is strictly analogous to traditional hartree - fock calculations , with the replacement of the analytical exchange matrix with an exchange - correlation matrix calculated by numerical integration @xcite .",
    "analytic gradients of the energy were computed including the derivatives of the quadrature weights @xcite .",
    "the `` standard grid-1 '' of gill et al.@xcite is used on the fluorines ; on the metals we use a simple grid of 100 concentric spheres , with radii chosen according to an euler - maclaurin scheme@xcite , on which are positioned quadrature points chosen according to the scheme of lebedev@xcite , using the 194 point ( 23rd order ) formul . this 100-point radial grid for the transition metal",
    "has been shown to provide atomic energies accurate to @xmath14 a.u . in a previous study @xcite .",
    "it is much larger than the fluorine grids and could be made significantly more economical with little loss in accuracy by applying a `` grid pruning '' technique@xcite .",
    "most atomic calculations were performed using a spin - restricted open - shell procedure as described in a previous work@xcite .",
    "the hybrid hf / dft , becke3lyp , calculations were performed with the gaussian 92/dft programs@xcite .",
    "a 100 point radial grid and 194 point angular grid was used on each atom .",
    "bond energies were obtained using atomic energies calculated with a spin - unrestricted kohn - sham procedure .",
    "our initial studies on these molecules used a general contraction of the @xmath15 cartesian - gaussian basis set of wachters@xcite augmented with the diffuse @xmath16 function of hay@xcite .",
    "as described previously@xcite , we have used wachters hartree - fock coefficients in our contraction , and contract the inner parts of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 orbitals to obtain a @xmath23 $ ] set using the general contraction scheme of raffenetti@xcite .",
    "the more diffuse primitives of each space are left free .",
    "this contracted set gave b - lyp total energies for sc - cr to within @xmath24 a.u .",
    "of the completely uncontracted results , and excitation and ionization energies to within @xmath25ev@xcite . with this metal basis set , we then examined various levels for the fluorine basis set in @xmath3 .",
    "table  [ tb : fbas ] reports the optimal geometrical parameters , average bond energies , and relative stability for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 conformers of @xmath3 in the b - lyp approximation .",
    "examination of table  [ tb : fbas ] reveals that inclusion of the @xmath16 polarization function ( 6 - 31 g * ) decreases the optimum bond length in both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 conformers by some 0.02  .",
    "consistent with this shorter bond length , the average bond energy increases by @xmath28 kcal / mol in both conformers .",
    "the relative energy is only slightly changed , the @xmath26 conformer being more stable by @xmath29 kcal / mol .",
    "because these species are expected to be ionic in character , calculations were performed in which diffuse @xmath30 and @xmath31 functions were added to the fluorine atom ( 6 - 31g+ ) .",
    "relative to the double - zeta 6 - 31 g basis , this modification increased the bond lengths by @xmath25  , and decreased the average bond energy by @xmath28 kcal / mol .",
    "the addition of the diffuse functions had a more pronounced influence on the energy difference than did inclusion of the polarization function ; the @xmath26 form is @xmath32 kcal / mol more stable than the @xmath13 form in the ( 6 - 31g+ ) basis . a final calculation in which both diffuse and polarization functions were added to the fluorines ( 6 - 31g+ * ) yields a nearly identical relative stability of @xmath33 kcal / mol . in the calculations to follow , then , the ( 6 - 31g+ * ) basis is used for the ligands .",
    "there were additional issues regarding the transition metal basis set which we wished to address before examining the series .",
    "first of all , folklore has it that wachters primitive set optimized for the atoms is sometimes inadequate in the valence 4s / p region in a molecule .",
    "specifically , the primitive @xmath30 space may be too diffuse , and the functions provided by wachters to describe the @xmath34 atomic orbital are also more diffuse than those which might be needed to act as a polarization function in a molecule .",
    "preliminary tests were therefore run on @xmath0 and @xmath1 in which the two most diffuse of wachters @xmath30 primitives were replaced by tighter functions chosen to make the set more even - tempered . for sc",
    "the new exponents were .12 and .04 , for ti they were .2 and .07 . for @xmath0",
    "the change in total energy with the modification of the @xmath30 set was only @xmath35 kcal / mol .",
    "addition of a diffuse @xmath31 function , @xmath36 , changed the total energy of @xmath0 by @xmath37 kcal / mol .",
    "similar results were found for @xmath1 .",
    "modification of the metal @xmath30 and @xmath31 set thus appears to be a minor effect in this series , presumably because of the ionic character of the bonding .",
    "a second issue concerns the relative importance of @xmath38 functions in dft calculations .",
    "previous research using ci and coupled - cluster techniques discovered a profound effect on the relative stability when @xmath38 polarization functions were included on the metal .",
    "we found that addition of a metal @xmath38 function , optimized in the b - lyp calculation , had a relatively minor effect on the energy . in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "addition of an optimized @xmath38 function changed the total energy by @xmath28 kcal / mol , or @xmath37 kcal / mol in the average bond energy . in the discussion to follow , we compare results using the @xmath23 $ ] contraction of wachters original basis and this basis augmented with an @xmath38 function optimized in the b - lyp calculation @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "these optimized @xmath38 exponents were found to be 0.4 for sc , and 0.5 for the other three molecules .",
    "table  [ tb : results1 ] compares theoretical and experimental bond lengths for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the two major headings refer to the results using the @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] metal atom bases .",
    "it can be seen that the additional metal @xmath38 function has little effect on the equilibrium distances , regardless of the theoretical method used . if any trend can be observed , it is a tendency for the @xmath38 function to decrease the bond lengths slightly ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "concentrating on the @xmath39 $ ] results , hf theory and the s - vwn aproximation are generally in good agreement with experiment .",
    "an exception occurs for @xmath0 where hf theory underestimates the bond length by @xmath41 , with s - vwn being @xmath42  too short .",
    "this exception was also noted in the s - vwn calculations of sosa et al.@xcite although the basis sets , grids , and other details of our calculations differ from theirs , the agreement between the present s - vwn results and this earlier research is excellent .",
    "perhaps most disappointing in table  [ tb : results1 ] is the tendency of the b - lyp approximation to overestimate the bond lengths . for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where hf and s - vwn are in good agreement with experiment , the b - lyp results are @xmath43longer than experiment .",
    "similar behavior was obtained with b - lyp in a series of molecules comprised of first row atoms @xcite , although the error was smaller , of the order of 0.02 . in the transition - metal fluoride series studied here , the origin of this behavior is associated with the becke exchange functional .",
    "this can be seen from table  [ tb : results3 ] where the equilibrium distances predicted by various functional combinations are presented .",
    "note that both the b - vwn and b - lyp approximations give distances which are too long , while s - vwn and s - lyp give distances in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the reason for this behavior is unknown ; as is shown below , the hybrid hf / dft version suggested by becke largely remedies the problem@xcite .",
    "table  [ tb : results2 ] compares average bond energies , @xmath44 , for the various methods with experiment .",
    "the experimental values in table  [ tb : results2 ] were obtained from enthalpies of formation at @xmath45@xcite .",
    "the theoretical quantities reported are obtained by subtracting the energy of the molecule from the sum of the energies of the atoms , and dividing by the number of fluorines . in order to compare the theoretical results directly with experiment ,",
    "they should be corrected for the zero - point contribution and for the difference in enthalpies of formation between 298 and 0@xmath46k . in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "this thermodynamic information is available from experiment@xcite . to the experimental heat of atomization at 298@xmath46k , the zero - point contribution and differences in enthalpy for 0@xmath46k , + 5.5 kcal / mol and -3.5 kcal / mole , respectively , should be added to obtain a `` corrected '' experimental value .",
    "this `` corrected '' value thus increases by 2.0 kcal / mol , or 0.5 kcal / mol / bond for @xmath1 . as a result",
    "the average bond energy would be 140.4 instead of 139.9 kcal / mol , which can be compared directly with the theoretical value of 149.5 kcal / mol for blyp . while vibrational frequencies are known for @xmath2 , the other information needed to make corrections for the other molecules",
    "is not available .",
    "we estimate that these corrections would range from 0.3 to 0.7 kcal / mol for the average bond energies as one goes from @xmath0 to @xmath3 .",
    "these corrected estimates appear parenthetically in table  [ tb : results2 ]    the first point to notice is that the @xmath38-functions have a minor influence on the average bond energy .",
    "they contribute @xmath47 kcal / mol per bond in the dft calculations , and somewhat more for the hf calculation , up to @xmath48 kcal / mol in @xmath2 .",
    "as expected , the hf bond energies are in poor agreement with experiment .",
    "the error per bond grows quickly as the number of bonds increases ; the error is @xmath49 kcal / mol per bond in @xmath2 .",
    "this is shown graphically in figure  [ gf : bonderr ] .",
    "on the other hand , the error in the s - vwn dft approximation is more constant as the size of the molecule increases .",
    "the s - vwn approximation overbinds the molecule , by @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 kcal / mol per bond in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the b - lyp bond energies are in much better agreement with experiment . like s - vwn",
    ", this approximation also overestimates the bond energy , but by only @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 kcal / mol , respectively .",
    "this error is somewhat larger than the typical error observed in studies of organics , but it should be kept in mind that quite extensive theoretical treatments including very large one- and many - electron bases would be necessary in order to obtain this degree of accuracy in conventional hf - based correlation schemes .    it is sometimes argued that more accurate bond energies are obtained when using spin - unrestricted kohn - sham ( uks ) atomic results , as opposed to the spin - restricted open - shell method used here . since the dft approximations generally overbind the molecule , and the uks method will always yield atomic energies identical to or lower than the roks method , the use of uks atomic energies will certainly decrease the bond energies , thereby improving the apparent agreement with experiment . in order to investigate the magnitude of this effect , we calculated uks atomic energies using gaussian92/dft@xcite . in the @xmath23/[6 - 31g+*]$ ] basis set ,",
    "the average bond energies were 153.4 , 146.8 and 122.3 for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the difference between our roks and these uks results is small ( @xmath56 kcal / mole per bond ) .",
    "becke@xcite has argued that the residual tendency of the gradient - corrected dft methods to overbind stems from the exchange functional and has introduced a hybrid method in which a component of the `` exact '' hartree - fock exchange is retained in the energy expression .",
    "we have therefore also examined a variant of this hybrid approach , the becke3lyp method .",
    "the @xmath39/[6 - 31g+*]$ ] basis set was used , giving the results shown in table  [ tb : b3lyp ] .",
    "the results are in very good agreement with experiment : the difference in the average bond energies between the raw becke3lyp results and the `` corrected '' experimental values is 2.0 , 1.4 and 1.7 kcal / mol per bond .",
    "bond lengths are also significantly improved over the b - lyp approach .",
    "they are approximately 0.01  too long , except in the case of @xmath0 , where the bond length is underestimated by 0.05 . given the success of the method for the other molecules , this experimental determination should probably be revisited .      before discussing the present results for @xmath3 , a brief review of the history of",
    "the problem is useful . in 1963 , hellberg , mller and glemser@xcite reported the preparation of a volatile yellow substance which they identified as @xmath3 .",
    "on the basis of vibrational data , hope , et al.@xcite assigned octahedral @xmath57 symmetry to the molecule .",
    "the first _ ab initio _ theoretical treatment of @xmath58 @xmath59 complexes was reported by kang , albright and eisenstein in 1989 @xcite ; these studies predicted octahedral geometry for @xmath3 at the mp2/minimum basis set level of theory .",
    "this prediction was countered by the calculations of marsden and wolynec@xcite who concluded that @xmath3 was probably trigonal prismatic @xmath60 based on the predictions of coupled - cluster theory with double substitutions ( ccd ) in a double - zeta basis set .",
    "jacob and willner @xcite carried out new experiments and argued that @xmath3 had not yet been prepared , and that earlier experiments had merely produced @xmath12 .",
    "hope , levason and ogden @xcite responded with a more detailed analysis of their data and again concluded that @xmath3 had octahedral geometry .",
    "more extensive theoretical treatments then came into play .",
    "pierloot and roos @xcite performed caspt2 ( complete active space with second - order mller - plesset perturbation theory ) calculations in a large basis set , and found that the octahedral isomer was 50 kcal / mol lower in energy than the prismatic isomer .",
    "neuhaus , frenking , huber and gauss @xcite discovered two interesting facts .",
    "the first is a large differential effect in the scf energies when @xmath38 functions are included in the cr basis set .",
    "scf calculations without @xmath38 functions showed the prismatic isomer to be preferred , but with @xmath38 functions the octahedral isomer was favored by 11 kcal / mol .",
    "neuhas , et al .  then explored a hierarchy of coupled cluster expansions with a smaller double - zeta basis and discovered a second interesting point : a large differential effect in the correlation energies of the two isomers associated with the contribution of triple excitations . in their double - zeta basis",
    "it was nearly as large as the differential effect of @xmath38 functions at the scf level . by combining these two results ,",
    "neuhas et al",
    ".  concluded that the octahedral isomer was lower in energy by some 20 kcal / mol .",
    "meanwhile , back in the lab , a 1992 experimental paper from jacobs , mller , willner , jacob and brger @xcite once again argued that @xmath3 had not in fact been prepared .",
    "most recently , in 1994 , marsden , moncrieff and quelch @xcite reported correlated calculations using cisd , ccsd and ccsd(t ) methods with a large basis including @xmath38 functions on the metal .",
    "their work confirmed the sensitivity of the results to metal @xmath38 functions and triple excitations .",
    "their most extensive calculation favored the octahedral isomer by @xmath61 kcal / mol .",
    "thus , at the present time , theory is converging to the position that the octahedral form is more stable than the prismatic .",
    "the magnitude of the difference is still not settled , particularly given the large effect of triple excitations on the relative stability .",
    "the results of the b - lyp calculations for @xmath3 are presented in table  [ tb : results1 ] and table  [ tb : results2 ] , and those using the becke3lyp approximation in table  [ tb : b3lyp ] . once again , the becke3lyp method yields shorter bond lengths and smaller binding energies than b - lyp .",
    "the becke3lyp equilibrium bond distances for both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 forms are similar , 1.73  and 1.74 respectively .",
    "the optimum bond angle in the @xmath27 isomer , i.e. that between a three - fold axis and a cr - f bond , was found to be @xmath62 , in good agreement with earlier hf calculations which found @xmath63 .",
    "the average bond energy follows the trend established in the earlier members of the series of decreasing strength with increasing number of bonds .",
    "the difference in energy between the two isomers is @xmath64 kcal / mol .",
    "this result is very close to the latest ccsd(t ) calculations of marsden , et al .  who found 14.2 kcal / mol .",
    "since the experimental efforts at identifying the molecule have focussed on the vibrational spectrum , we present in table  [ tb : freqs ] the b - lyp harmonic frequencies of the @xmath11 isomer .",
    "the two infrared active modes occur at @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the former is in excellent agreement with the experimental bend observed@xcite at @xmath67 .",
    "the latter is in reasonable agreement with the intense mode observed at @xmath68 .",
    "although there are not many cases reported yet , it appears that the gradient - corrected approximations tend to underestimate metal - ligand stretching frequencies . this would be consistent with the observed tendency of b - lyp to overestimate bond lengths . as discussed above ,",
    "the becke3lyp approximation significantly improved both the bond lengths and the bond energies relative to b - lyp ; we therefore also examined the vibrational frequencies predicted by becke3lyp ( table  [ tb : freqs ] ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions of 768 and 336 @xmath69 are in excellent agreement with the experimentally observed bands .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the ir intensities of the becke3lyp modes is 0.081 , which agrees with the corresponding ratio in the experiments of jacob and willner@xcite , 0.080 .",
    "these calculations strongly support both the conclusion that @xmath3 has been prepared and the assignment of @xmath11 symmetry .",
    "as has been noted many times before@xcite , an advantage of the dft approach is that the density , and hence the energy , converges much more rapidly with basis set than does the correlation energy in configuration - interaction or coupled - cluster approaches .",
    "a case in point in the present work is the relative insensitivity of the results to the presence of @xmath38 functions on the metal .",
    "this can be contrasted with the research reviewed above . in hartree - fock",
    "based correlation approaches the @xmath38 functions must provide for angular correlation among the @xmath16 electrons , while in dft calculations they play the role of polarization functions only .",
    "the small effect they have on the structure and bond energies in this series is presumably a reflection of the ionic character of the bonding . in the ionic limit , the metal density is roughly spherical , and the dominant polarization effects should come from @xmath31 functions .",
    "the bond energies provided by the b - lyp approximation are in fairly good agreement with experiment .",
    "the decrease in average bond energy down the series is faithfully reproduced , and the absolute values are within @xmath70 kcal / mol of experiment even in this relatively modest double - zeta - polarization basis set .",
    "the b - lyp distances , however , appear to be consistently too long by @xmath71  , with the exception of @xmath0 .",
    "the anomalous behavior of @xmath0 suggests a problem with the experimental data .",
    "both the bond distances and energies are greatly improved in the hybrid hf / dft becke3lyp approach .",
    "distances are within 0.01  and average bond energies within 2 kcal / mole per bond of experiment .",
    "this success is impressive , especially considering that the molecules studied here are quite different from those used by becke to generate his fit .",
    "we note that ricca and bauschlicher@xcite have recently found that the becke3lyp approximation provides excellent thermochemistries in the series @xmath72 .",
    "the bonding in these carbonyls is certainly quite different from the ionic limit studied in the current contribution ; the approach appears very promising given the small sample of transition metal complexes studied thus far .    finally , our b - lyp calculations suggest that the octahedral form of @xmath3 is preferred over the @xmath13 form by @xmath73 kcal / mol ; this number is reduced to 14 kcal / mol in the becke3lyp approximation .",
    "the becke3lyp ir - active vibrational frequencies and relative intensities computed for the @xmath11 structure are in excellent agreement with the experimental infrared spectrum and support the original assignment of hope , et al .",
