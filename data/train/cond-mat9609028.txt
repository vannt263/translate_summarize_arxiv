    "the dependence of the total energy of a ferromagnetic crystal on the direction of magnetization originates from the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction as well as from spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , as proposed by van vleck  @xcite .",

    "recently , a magnetization easy - axis perpendicular to the film plane has been observed for a wide variety of thin film systems , for example for thin films of fcc fe on cu(001 )  @xcite .",
    "some of these systems are promising candidates for magnetic high - density storage media .    in spite of many theoretical attempts  @xcite ,",
    "the relation between the electronic structure and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy @xmath0 could not be fully clarified so far .",
    "some very important questions are subject to intense discussion : ( i ) which bandstructure details lead to significant contributions to @xmath0 ? especially the treatment of degenerate bands near the fermi level has brought up controversies  @xcite .",

    "finally , the correct prediction of magnetic anisotropy for real systems still remains a challenge , since due to the quenching of orbital angular momentum in 3@xmath1 transition metal systems , @xmath0 is several orders of magnitude smaller than other contributions to the total energy of a crystal ( typically about @xmath4  mev per atom in ultrathin films ) .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy of thin films has been investigated using two essentially different approaches . in semiempirical calculations",

    "convergence , however , is difficult to achieve ; sometimes , additional assumptions are made in order to obtain converged results ( _ state tracking method _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the structure of thin fe films deposited on cu(001 ) has been widely investigated , especially the dependence of the structure and magnetization orientation on the temperature . for films of less than 5 monolayers ( ml ) deposited at low temperatures ,",

    "is observed , as well as a restructuration of the film .",

    "moreover , we find the characteristic scale for the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy to be @xmath2 , rather than the bandwidth .",
    "this supports the significance of the lifting of degeneracies at @xmath6 by @xmath2 and demonstrates the importance of contributions to magnetic anisotropy due to fermi - edge smearing .",

    ", we find a transition from magnetization perpendicular to the plane to in - plane magnetization at about 4 ml .",
    "we conclude from our calculation that the experimentally observed reorientation at 5 layers is not necessarily caused by a structural phase transition . for ni",

    "due to time reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the contribution of the lifting of degenerate bands , which are shifted linearly with @xmath2 , depends on the fraction of states in @xmath29-space influenced by the degeneracy .",

    "unlike stated by those authors , however , this does not rule out contributions to @xmath0 of the lifting of degeneracies ( ii ) . in section iii.b and fig .",
    "[ entartung ] , we show explicitly that such contributions play a very important role for @xmath0 in the monolayers considered .",

    "@xmath98 increases for decreasing @xmath66 ( decreasing bandwidth ) .",

    "we discuss in detail how the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy can be related to the electronic bandstructure .",
    "a 3@xmath1-band degeneracy can make large contributions to @xmath0 , if ( i ) it is lifted by soc for one direction of magnetization ( @xmath126 ) and remains for another ( @xmath127 ) ; ( ii ) it is located near the fermi level @xmath6 ; ( iii ) it runs along a line in * k*-space and ( iv ) the degenerate bands have no or very little dispersion along this line . before showing that such degeneracies indeed occur in the bandstructures , we estimate their contribution within a linearized bandstructure ( see fig .",
    "[ entartung ] ) . if @xmath6 is situated below or above the two subbands , no contribution to @xmath0 results : @xmath128 .",
    "the maximal contribution occurs when the degeneracy lies exactly at the fermi level @xmath6 and amounts to : @xmath129 since the fraction @xmath130 of involved states in the irreducible quarter of the bz is @xmath131 .",

    "wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite implicitly assume that the degenerate bands are dispersive in either dimension of * k*-space .",
    "this would lead to @xmath133 and @xmath122 and justify the exclusion of degeneracies from their calculation in order to improve convergence . in the light of our results , however , this assumption is incorrect and it neglects very important contributions to @xmath0 .    in fig .",

    "the * k*-space resolved analysis of @xmath142 ( fig .",

    "especially the subbands @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( and , correspondingly , @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) change their roles if the magnetization is changed from @xmath161 to @xmath162 and vice versa , because the orbitals @xmath16 and @xmath17 have different orbital momenta with respect to the @xmath24- and @xmath163-axes . these subbands will thus be involved in the lifting of degeneracies by altering magnetization and possibly , as shown above , yield important contributions to @xmath0 . in the case of fe parameters ,",
    "the situation is even simpler since coupling between states of opposite spin ( @xmath150 and @xmath164 with @xmath165 ) can be neglected .",

    "in addition , we must conclude from our results that shifting of subbands far below the fermi - level is not so important , since then @xmath193 could not be essentially lowered on such a small temperature scale .",

    "the contribution of the degeneracies to the anisotropy energy is not so evident , the minority and majority spin bands mix much more than in the case of fe because of the small exchange coupling . this is a possible reason for the nearly constant anisotopy energy we obtain .",

    "<S> the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy @xmath0 of free - standing monolayers and thin films of fe and ni is determined using two different semi - empirical schemes . within a _ tight - binding calculation _ for the 3@xmath1 bands alone , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in detail the relation between bandstructure and @xmath0 , treating spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) non - pertubatively . </S>",
    "<S> we find important contributions to @xmath0 due to the lifting of band degeneracies near the fermi level by soc . </S>",
    "<S> the important role of degeneracies is supported by the calculation of the electron temperature dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy , which decreases with the temperature increasing on a scale of several hundred k. in general , @xmath0 scales with the square of the soc constant @xmath2 . including 4@xmath3 bands and @xmath3-@xmath1 hybridization , the _ combined interpolation scheme _ yields anisotropy energies that quantitatively agree well with experiments for fe and ni monolayers on cu(001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the anisotropy energy is calculated for systems of up to 14 layers . even after including _ s_-bands and for multilayers , the importance of degeneracies persists . </S>",
    "<S> considering a fixed fct - fe structure , we find a reorientation of the magnetization from perpendicular to in - plane at about 4 layers . for ni </S>",
    "<S> , we find the correct in - plane easy - axis for the monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the anisotropy energy remains nearly constant , we do not find the experimentally observed reorientation .    </S>",
