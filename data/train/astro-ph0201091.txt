    "the giant  region ngc  3603 , located at a distance of about 6  kpc , shows the densest concentration and largest collection of visible massive stars known in our galaxy .",
    "recent hst images of @xmath602 angular resolution @xcite have shown that ngc  3603 consists of three wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and @xmath670 o - type stars , with an estimated 4050 of these stars located in the central @xmath630@xmath730  ( 1 pc @xmath7 1 pc ) region .",
    "the three h - rich wr - stars of subtype wnl are also located within @xmath61  of each other in the central core and are the brightest members of the cluster .",
    "they are believed to be massive main sequence stars which , like the bright stars in r136a , drive very strong winds @xcite .",
    "ngc  3603 has also been shown to be a seat of active star formation outside the main cluster region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , three distinct dense cometary nebulae were detected there using hst and vlt : are these ultra compact   regions ( uchr ) or proplyds ?",
    "uchrs are small ( @xmath80.1  pc ) nebulae , _ internally _ photoionized by a deeply embedded , massive star .",
    "even though the embedded stars are very luminous , they are invisible at optical wavelengths because of the surrounding dust ; instead they show strong far - infrared emission .",
    "their radio continuum emission is often associated with oh and h@xmath9o masers .",
    "the morphology of uchrs in high resolution radio continuum images ranges from spherical , cometary , core - halo , shell , to irregular @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a proto - planetary disk ( proplyd ) is a phenomenon describing a low - mass , young stellar object ( yso ) with a circumstellar disk , embedded in a dense ( neutral and ionized ) envelope that is being _ externally _ photo - evaporated by the ultraviolet radiation from one or more massive stars .",
    "these low - mass stars are not able to ionize their surroundings significantly . the disks in these systems are either observed directly ( as in orion where the disks are seen directly or in silhouette against the bright background nebula @xcite ) , or are inferred because in almost all of the proplyds ( young ) low - mass stars are visible at optical or near - infrared wavelengths ( see e.g. @xcite ) . at low angular resolution proplyds",
    "look like uchrs , but at high resolution , optical and near - infrared images reveal their different nature .",
    "so most proplyds would have been classified as uchrs prior to those observations . in some cases",
    "the distinction between the two classes remains difficult .",
    "given the fact that there are about four times more uchrs than expected @xcite from star formation rates and the potential problems identifying host stars for uchrs ( e.g. some may not have enough fir flux to account for an internal ob star ) , it may well be that a large fraction of catalogued uchrs are mis - identified proplyds .",
    "interferometric radio continuum observations of proplyds are needed to determine their structure , spectral indices and thus the nature of their emission , as well as mass loss rates and extinctions when compared to measured  fluxes .",
    "proplyds were first identified in the orion nebula , where over 150 of them are known @xcite .",
    "two proplyds have been identified in more distant nebulae : one in ngc  2024 by @xcite and one , g5.971.17 , in the lagoon nebula by @xcite .",
    "the three objects , hereafter referred to p1 , p2 and p3 , in ngc  3603 @xcite are the biggest , youngest and most massive ones found _",
    "so far_. they are also the most distant known .",
    "these emission nebulae are clearly resolved in the hst / wfpc2 observations , and share the overall morphology of the proplyds in orion .",
    "all three nebulae are rim - brightened and tear - drop shaped with the tails pointing away from the central ionizing cluster .    according to @xcite the brightest object ( p1 ) , which has a projected distance of 1.3  pc from the cluster , has the spectral ( excitation ) characteristics of a uchr .",
    "optical spectra reveal the presence of an underlying , heavily reddened continuum source , which is also confirmed by near - infrared vlt / isaac observations .",
    "the wfpc2 observations show that only the outermost layer is ionized whereas the interior is neutral .",
    "the morphology of p1 is described as a heart - shaped head with a collimated structure in between , which can be understood as the superposition of two individual proplyds .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "p2 and p3 , located at projected distances of 2.2  pc and 2.0  pc from the stellar cluster , respectively , show approximately axisymmetric morphologies .",
    "no embedded disk or central star has been detected so far in any of these nebulae , preventing a clear identification as proto - planetary disks . the optical point source ( see fig .",
    "2c ) close to p3 is probably not physically linked to the nebula @xcite .",
    "the structures in ngc  3603 are about two orders of magnitude fainter than typical uchrs , but have a typical extent of 9000 au with tails extending to 21000 au , much larger in size than the proplyds in orion .",
    "recent 3.4  cm radio continuum and recombination line measurements of ngc  3603 by @xcite , which were focussed on abundance measurements and the bright continuum emission from the ionized gas in this region , have an angular resolution of @xmath67  and a @xmath10 sensitivity of 55 mjy . by obtaining high sensitivity and high angular resolution ( @xmath612 ) observations we primarily aimed to study the radio emission of the winds from many of the early - type stars in the cluster , as well as to detect and resolve the s and other gaseous regions in the cluster periphery .",
    "this paper will focus on the sources only , which have been detected and are shown to be clearly resolved with the . a subsequent paper containing a detailed study of the whole ngc",
    "3603 region based on our  observations will follow .",
    "radio continuum observations of ngc  3603 were made with the australia telecope compact array ( ) in the 6a , b , c and d configurations in five observing runs in february , april , june , september and november 2000 with a total of 60 hours assigned observing time .",
    "the observing frequencies were 4.8  ghz ( 6  cm ) and 8.64  ghz ( 3  cm ) with a bandwidth in each case of 128 mhz .",
    "detailed observing parameters are given in table  1 .",
    "the three data sets were combined , reduced and analysed in miriad using standard procedures .",
    "the full stokes parameters were measured .",
    "the flux density scale was calibrated using observations of the primary calibrator , 1934638 , assuming flux densities of 2.84 and 5.83 jy at 3 and 6  cm , respectively .",
    "a primary beam correction was carried out . to obtain high angular resolution and filter the extended emission to emphasize the small scale structure we used uniform weighting of the _ uv _ data while omitting the shortest baselines , up to @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we find that for a @xmath11 cutoff all bright extended nebula emission is removed from the s even at 6  cm .",
    "1 shows an example of a combined 3  cm radio map where a @xmath12 cut of @xmath13 was chosen . a zoom on the three s",
    "is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for the 6  cm maps a @xmath12 cut of @xmath11 was used . the average r.m.s . in these combined radio maps",
    "was approximately 0.2 mjy at 3  cm and 0.4 mjy at 6  cm , but varies throughout the map .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "levels near the s , which lie in rather empty regions , were @xmath14 mjy at 3  cm and @xmath15 mjy at 6  cm .",
    "the dynamic range in the 3 and 6  cm images is about 1:100 . fitting a 2d - gaussian to the dirty beam",
    "gives fwhm values of 094 @xmath7 077 to 106 @xmath7 087 at 3  cm and 153 @xmath7 123 to 183 @xmath7 149 at 6  cm depending on the @xmath12 cut employed . in fig .",
    "2 we have restored the cleaned maps with a circular gaussian beam of width 1  at 3  cm and 2  at 6  cm .    to create spectral index maps between 3 and 6  cm we convolved the 3  cm map with a gaussian appropriate to achieve the resolution of the beam fwhm at 6  cm .",
    "the spectral index maps were then derived from the 6  cm and convolved 3  cm maps using a clip value of 1.0  mjy beam@xmath3 , corresponding to approximately @xmath16 at 3  cm and @xmath10 at 6  cm ( statistical errors ) .",
    "error maps for the spectral index maps were calculated using error propagation. we note , however , that spectral indices of extended sources as obtained from interferometric data have to be regarded with caution .",
    "the three sources found with the  at 3 and 6  cm are clearly resolved , showing a head - tail extent of @xmath64  ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "p3 shows the most pronounced head - tail structure with a 3  cm flux density ratio between head and tail of about 10:1 .",
    "the tail is very well defined and at least 2  long , pointing away from the central star cluster .",
    "unfortunately , p3 is rather faint in the low - sensitivity hst broad band image shown by @xcite ; it is located outside the region of their high - sensitivity  image .",
    "the three s have a cometary or head - tail shape at cm - radio wavelengths , matching their appearance in optical images ( see fig .  2 )",
    ".    integrated radio flux densities and peak fluxes are derived by summing over the whole s , and by fitting circular gaussians to each object .",
    "statistical flux uncertainties are estimated as map r.m.s .",
    "times number of beamsizes covered by the source .",
    "dependent on the method of flux determination , beam size and @xmath12 cut employed to the maps ( 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 k@xmath17 ) the resulting flux densities vary .",
    "the standard deviation of this variation is considered as systematic uncertainty .",
    "we found that the systematic uncertainties are always larger than the statistical error . in table  2",
    "we report the average fluxes and their uncertainties of all 3 nebulae , together with their average spectral indices derived from the integrated fluxes .",
    "circular gaussians are used to at least attempt disentangling the head and tail structures in these cometary - shaped objects .",
    "the radio heads of the s are typically 23  in diameter while the total head - tail extent is @xmath64 .",
    "p3 shows the most pronounced head - tail structure of the three ( most likely due to the viewing angle ) and the smallest head ( diameter @xmath62 ) among all three s , with the largest peak flux at 3  cm while the integrated head flux is comparable . its head - to - tail flux ratio is about 10:1 , whereas in the other two s part of the tail may be confused with the head flux density .",
    "both , p1 and p2 , appear inclined with respect to the plane of the sky , with p1 inclined at a larger angle than p2 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  2 where we have indicated the projected direction to the ionizing source .",
    "3 shows the residual radio continuum image of p1 after removing a single circular gaussian component .",
    "the residual map of p1 shows two excess emission sites , one corresponding to the tail , and a second one north of it .",
    "recent  images indicate that p1 is composed of two separate cometary - shaped objects @xcite .",
    "we interpret the northern excess as the second head .",
    "a two component gaussian fit to p1 at 3  cm gives peak fluxes of 4.6 mjy beam@xmath3 and 1.4 mjy beam@xmath3 , and integrated flux densities of 9.9 mjy and 5.7 mjy for the two heads , with a separation of the two peaks of 13 .",
    "a two component model could not be applied to the lower resolution 6-cm data .",
    "the tails of all three s are directed away from the star cluster , approximately coincident with the tails in  within the positional uncertainty of the radio / optical pointings ( see fig .  2 ;",
    "note the shift of 05 in declination and right ascension of the hst - image which we have employed in these figures ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the radio position is @xmath6015 while hst has a pointing uncertainty of @xmath18 .",
    "the present data were obtained in all four stokes parameters .",
    "no polarization signal above 3@xmath19 was detected .",
    "possible flux variability on timescales @xmath20 days expected from e.g. flaring pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars with non - thermal radio spectra , can not be tested with the present data .",
    "the radio continuum fluxes ( see table  2 ) are a factor of 9 to 21 larger than those predicted by @xcite assuming optically - thin thermal bremsstrahlung as the radio emission mechanism @xcite , which scales with the ( extinction corrected )  flux . the neutral part of the envelope of the may attenuate  photons from the far side of the object depending on the viewing angle .",
    "however , @xcite have estimated this effect to be less than 25% of the total  light for an isotropic ensemble of proplyds .",
    "furthermore , the reasonable coincidence of the sizes of the s in the radio and optical band suggests that this effect is not important here . for p1 and p3 the integrated fluxes at 6  cm are higher than that at 3  cm , whereas similar flux densities were predicted .",
    "the average spectral index of each object , shown in table  2 , is calculated on the basis of the integral fluxes at 3  cm and 6  cm in this table .",
    "modeling the uv distribution of the 6  cm map to match the uv distribution at 3  cm gives similar results .",
    "the average spectral indices of p1 and p3 are negative ( p3 only marginally ) , between @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , indicating non - thermal emission , while the spectrum of p2 ( @xmath24 ) is in agreement with the expectation from optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations predict spectral indices of @xmath25 near the ionization fronts , which can increase up to @xmath26 when considering in addition a hydrodynamically collimated jet ( s.  richling , private communication ) .",
    "negative spectral indices can not be explained by this model .",
    "because of the high resolution and sensitivity in the radio maps , we were able to generate spectral index maps for all three s. fig .",
    "4 shows examples of the spectral index maps .",
    "here we used the radio maps shown in fig .  2 and constrain ourselves to brightness densities greater than 1.0  mjybeam@xmath3 , which corresponds to roughly 5  @xmath19 at 6  cm and 10  @xmath19 at 3  cm ( based on statistical error estimates ) .",
    "the radio emission zone within each appears to be inhomogeneous .",
    "the spectra in at least two of the sources appear steeper in the tail than in the head , with a tendency of positive spectral indices located towards the region facing the ionizing star cluster .",
    "@xcite have derived the reddening towards ngc  3603 from ubv photometry , and found @xmath27  mag for the cluster core . however , as can be seen in their data , the visual extinction is not uniform across the whole star forming region , but increases significantly with distance from the star cluster , mainly towards the north and the south .",
    "this is confirmed by recent vlt / isaac data on the basis of 4750 stars , showing that the extinction can be as high as a@xmath28  mag ( brandner , private communication ) .",
    "for example , star mtt  68 , close to p3 , has a@xmath29  mag , whereas star mtt  81 near p1 has a@xmath30  mag , and star mtt  79 close to p2 has extinction a@xmath31  mag .",
    "here we use @xmath32 as used by melnick et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for ngc  3603 .",
    "thus , it appears likely that p2 and p3 suffer from stronger foreground extinction than the stars in the cluster center which have on average a@xmath33  mag .    using the ratio between radio flux density and  flux as given by mccullough et al . , ( 1995 ; their equation 5 ) and assuming that the radio flux density at 3  cm is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung , we predict the  flux using our 3  cm radio continuum data .",
    "the predicted fluxes are then compared to the  fluxes measured by @xcite and used to derive lower limits for the extinction , @xmath34 .",
    "( if ( gyro-)synchrotron radiation dominates the radio emission , which comes from an emitting region as specified in sect .  4.4 , the derived extinction @xmath34 would be higher , with the exact value depending on the magnetic field . )",
    "table  3 shows the calculated fluxes ( assuming @xmath35  k ) and extinctions .",
    "note the uncertainty in comparing different areas for which the  fluxes and the radio continuum fluxes have been obtained .",
    "@xcite give the  surface brightness of the heads , measured for a 05 aperture radius , whereas we quote peak fluxes per beam where the beam size is @xmath610@xmath710 .",
    "for @xmath36 , we find a@xmath37 for p1 and a@xmath38 for p2 .",
    "we find thus significant excess extinction for both s , which may be intrinsic to the s themselves , otherwise the extinction estimate derived from the stars is underestimated .",
    "estimates for the electron / ion density inside the heads can be obtained from our radio data if thermal bremsstrahlung dominates the radio emission .",
    "this is likely to be the case for p2 and maybe p3 , while for p1 the derived values should be considered as upper limits .",
    "the bremsstrahlung intensity in the radio domain for a thermal , ionized h - gas of constant density in a sphere is @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the source distance in kpc , @xmath41 is the apparent radius of the source in arcsec , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the densities of the thermal electrons and ions , respectively , in @xmath44  @xmath5 , @xmath45 is the observing frequency in ghz and @xmath46 is the electron temperature of the ionized gas in @xmath44  k. @xmath47 is the ratio of thermally emitting to total volume of the source , and is introduced to account for the possibility of smaller emitting volumes than the apparent extent of the source .",
    "this is likely because only the outermost layers in proplyds are believed to be ionized .",
    "we estimate the proplyd heads @xmath6 2 - 3  in diameter . for @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "we estimate the electron density by comparing the expected radio flux with the observed 3  cm proplyd head flux densities , and find @xmath50(9 , 7 and 13)@xmath51  @xmath5 for p1 , p2 and p3 , respectively .",
    "( the corresponding emission measures are em = 5.9 , 3.5 and 9.3 @xmath52  @xmath53  pc . ) if the emitting volume is smaller than the total source volume , the electron density and emission measure increase accordingly . from spectral considerations",
    "the emission must be optically thin , i.e. free - free absorption may set in at frequencies lower than 4.8  ghz .",
    "thus values of em can not exceed @xmath6 several @xmath54  @xmath53  pc , in order to avoid free - free absorption at frequencies above 4.8  ghz .",
    "this constrains the size of the thermally emitting volume of the 3 s to at least 4% , 2% and 9% of the total source volumes , and consequently puts limits on the thermal electron densities in the sources : 4.5 , 4.9 and 4.3 @xmath55  @xmath5 for p1 , p2 and p3 , respectively .",
    "note that these numbers should be considered as upper limits if the observed radio flux is dominantly of non - thermal origin .",
    "these numbers are in reasonable agreement with @xmath56  @xmath5 derived from [ sii ] line ratios by @xcite . for the orion proplyds densities of order @xmath57  @xmath5",
    "have been found @xcite .",
    "note that our derived numbers suffer from uncertainties due to the unknown geometrical projection angle of the s , and hence the true source diameters .",
    "mass loss from the s occurs through external heating of the envelope by the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation field from hot stars , especially from the core of ngc  3603 , and subsequent evaporation . knowing the electron density , the mass - loss rate in a wind is given by @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the system radius , @xmath60 the ion mass and @xmath61 the evaporation velocity . assuming a pure hydrogen gas , @xmath62",
    ", we find @xmath63year@xmath3 for the heads of all three s , where @xmath64 is the wind velocity in units of 20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite found evaporation flow velocities of order 1025 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the derived upper limits for the mass - loss rates are of the same order as estimated by @xcite , and about two orders of magnitude higher than the typical values for the orion proplyds .    a rough estimate of the mass reservoir of the ngc  3603 s",
    "can then be derived by multiplying the mass loss rate with an estimated evaporation time scale of @xmath65 years @xcite .",
    "this gives a mass for the objects of order 110 , 101000 times larger than for the orion proplyds .",
    "the radius of the putative disks in these massive objects can be estimated using the evaporation model of @xcite which considers the mass reservoir in a disk - like shape .",
    "we find an approximate disk radius of 2000  au ( @xmath66 ) for all three ngc  3603 s : @xcite found @xmath63400  au from hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the s in ngc  3603 are 2030 times larger and much more spectacular than those in orion , which were detected at 2 and 20  cm with the vla ( see @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "orion contains numerous dense clumps , originally classified as uchrs , but now known to be proplyds .",
    "most orion proplyds have central disks , sometimes seen only in silhouette against the background light . on recent hst - images",
    "dozens of jets powered by young stars embedded in proplyds have been found @xcite .",
    "all orion proplyds detected at radio wavelengths are non - variable thermal emitters with spectral indices between 0.1 and 0.2 @xcite , and located within 0.04  pc of the dominant ionizing o - star ( @xmath67 ori c ) .",
    "the non - thermal orion radio sources show strong variability , and are mostly associated with visible pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "their non - thermal spectra are usually explained as due to stellar flaring activity .",
    "g5.971.17 ( @xmath68 = 1.8  kpc ) was originally classified as an ultracompact region , but is now thought to be a proplyd at @xmath69 au projected distance from the o7 star herschel 36 in the center of m8 , the lagoon nebula @xcite .",
    "eso near - infrared , hst optical and vla radio continuum observations indicate that g5.971.17 is a young star surrounded by a circumstellar disk that is likely being photo - evaporated by her 36 , similar to the proplyds in orion .",
    "the previous hypothesis suggested that g5.971.17 is a uchr intrinsically ionized by an embedded b0 star .",
    "however , @xcite showed that g5.971.17 is predominantly externally ionized , and thus the spectral type of the embedded star should be later than b5 .",
    "the flux over 06 is consistent with the @xmath70  cm appearance .",
    "optical and near infrared ( nir ) continuum images show the central star is displaced from the peak of the bow shock by 0125 .",
    "nir photometry of g5.971.17 revealed that its central star is extremely red , which can not be explained by extinction laws that use spherical matter distributions .",
    "this supports the idea of the circumstellar matter surrounding the central star of g5.971.17 being arranged as a disk .",
    "the cm - radio spectrum of g5.971.17 appears flat , which is interpreted as optically thin free - free emission @xcite .",
    "no oh or h@xmath9o masers , which are often associated with uchrs , are known in g5.971.17 .    in comparison ,",
    "the ngc  3603 s appear rather peculiar and spectacular .",
    "not only are they the largest and most massive ones found so far . exposed to an extremely strong fuv radiation field",
    ", they also suffer the largest mass losses , though their distances from the ionizing source are larger than for the orion or lagoon nebula proplyds .",
    "no embedded source nor disk has been found for any of the ngc  3603 s. at cm - wavelengths they are so far the only s showing non - thermal radio emission .    the spatial distribution of the ngc  3603 s is also peculiar .",
    "they are not only distributed apparently along a straight line ( see sect .  4.3 for further discussion ) , but all three also lie clearly to the north of the ionized gas region and avoid the region north - east and south - west from the stellar cluster .",
    "this is in contrast to the orion proplyds which do not appear to be located in preferred regions of the nebula ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since sequential star formation proceeding from north to south seems evident in ngc  3603 ( e.g. @xcite ) , this suggests that the structures in this region might have emerged just recently .",
    "a possible way to prove that the s have indeed been ionized _ externally _ by the star cluster is to show that the observed radio fluxes for the s are consistent with the number of ionizing photons they receive from the cluster stars . for simplicity",
    "we assume thermal radio emission , and note that this leads to an upper limit for the number of ionizing photons needed to produce the observed radio flux density . in this case",
    "the brightness temperature is directly proportional to the number of ionizing photons . because ngc  3603 contains a large number of stars that are extremely hot and luminous they provide an ionizing flux that is several orders of magnitude larger than that in orion or m  8 ( see table  4 ) . the expected brightness temperatures at the projected distances of 1.3  pc , 2.2  pc and 2.0  pc of the s from the ionizing source due to a lyman flux of @xmath71photons s@xmath3 @xcite are 200  k , 70  k and 90  k at 3  cm assuming @xmath72",
    "this is only slightly higher than our estimates derived from the 3  cm maps of 40  k , 30  k and 70  k for the three s , respectively .",
    "we can also compare the number of ionizing photons required to deliver the observed flux densities at the location of the s , and compare this number with the number of lyman photons they receive from the star cluster .",
    "noting that the s subtend a fraction of ( 6 , 3 and 2)@xmath73 , of the total solid angle seen by the cluster stars , they thus receive ( 6 , 3 and 2)@xmath74  photons  s@xmath3 , respectively . on the other hand , the required number of ionizing photons at the location of each to deliver the observed radio flux density is about @xmath75  photons  s@xmath3 in all three cases .",
    "these comparisons show that the number of required lyman photons is slightly lower than provided by the star cluster , and thus would even allow an additional dust attenuation and/or , more likely , longer linear distances between the s and the ionizing source in the external ionizing scenario",
    ". significant ionizing power from within the s appears therefore unlikely , which puts the spectral type of any central stars to later than @xmath6b1 , and hence mass to below @xmath76 .",
    "the present radio data as well as the recently published hst / vlt - images do not provide any direct evidence that the observed objects in ngc  3603 host any ( proto-)stellar objects or disks . to a limiting @xmath77-magnitude of 18 , no circumstellar",
    "disk or central stellar object in any of the three s has been detected by hst+vlt observations .",
    "instead the cometary - shaped nebulae may rather be massive emission regions photo - ionized by the radiation from the star cluster . @xcite",
    "have presented model calculations for such clumps , called fliers or ansea which are commonly located along the major axis towards the ionizing source .",
    "indeed , all three s apparently lie approximately along one straight line , with the outflow source , sher  25 , located roughly midway between p1 and p3 . although the bipolar outflow from sher  25 appears not to point in the direction of any of the three sources , the ring - like structure around sher  25 , roughly perpendicular to its jet , has been shown to expand with a velocity of @xmath78 km s@xmath3 @xcite , and could in principle be related to the origin of the clumps .",
    "in addition , models such as the flier model which are not based on disk - like mass distributions typically give short evaporation times , inconsistent with the distance of the s from sher  25 ( w.  brandner , private communication ) and the approximate date of the mass - loss event about 6630 years ago in sher  25 @xcite .",
    "thus , the existence of such features at large distances from the cluster centre appears to favor models where most of the material is concentrated in compact structures such as disks .",
    "the actual presence of disk - like structures is however not confirmed .      the significantly non - thermal spectrum ( @xmath79 ) from at least one of the three ngc  3603 s ( p1 ; p3 seems to be marginally non - thermal ) appears to be steepest ( @xmath80 ) in the tail , slightly flatter ( @xmath81 to 0.1 ) in the head , and have a tendency of positive spectral indices ( @xmath82 ) located towards the region facing the ionizing star cluster rather than away from it .",
    "this is not expected from non - thermal radio emission from a wind  wind collision region .",
    "the non - thermal radiation must originate rather from inside the s , either from their putative central stars hidden behind thick material , the surrounding disks or the envelopes . a stellar origin analogous to active star coronal emission seems to be unlikely because of the extended nature of the observed source .",
    "non - thermal radio spectra could be produced by a population of energetic particles emitting synchrotron , gyrosynchrotron or gyroresonance radiation in a magnetic field .",
    "for gyrosynchrotron radiation the emission is concentrated at harmonic numbers @xmath83 ( where @xmath84  ghz is the gyrofrequency , @xmath85 is the magnetic field strength in gauss ) , and thus magnetic fields strengths of order @xmath86  g are required .",
    "these high field values can not be present in extended sources , which leaves synchrotron radiation as the only plausible emission mechanism .",
    "disk or envelope , whatever the ultimate source might be , the negative spectral indices suggest optically thin non - thermal processes as the dominant radiation mechanism in p1 , and maybe p3",
    ". one could argue that the shock created by the evaporation flow predicted in proplyd models could accelerate charged particles within the objects .",
    "other possibilities may be inflow - outflow activity causing shocks during the early stage of star formation , compression and reconnection of magnetic fields in the collapsing envelope , or magnetic reconnection in star  disk interactions in young stellar objects leading to production of energetic particles .",
    "magnetic fields are known to exist in molecular clouds @xcite , and therefore it appears plausible that gas clumps still contain `` fossil '' fields . in a magnetized plasma ,",
    "acceleration due to particle collisions and subsequent bremsstrahlung can often be negligible in comparison with acceleration due to gyration around the field lines . in place of free - free emission , there is then synchrotron emission from energetic particles .",
    "the negative radio spectral indices in p1 and p3 are conveniently explained by non - thermal particle spectra .",
    "because thermal bremsstrahlung is proportional to @xmath87 and synchrotron emission is proportional to @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , the former dominates if the density is high enough , or if the temperature or field strength is low enough . indeed the electron densities found in the ngc  3603 s are @xmath6two orders of magnitude smaller than in the orion proplyds ( see table  4 ) .",
    "the different energy dependencies of the two kinds of emission may lead to one dominating at low frequencies and the other at high frequencies .",
    "a lower limit for a possible magnetic field is given by the razin - tsytovich effect . in order to avoid a razin - suppression of the radio spectrum above @xmath90  cm the magnetic field",
    "can not be smaller than @xmath2  g for an electron density of @xmath44  @xmath5 in the emission region .",
    "on the other hand , to avoid gyroresonance absorption above @xmath90  cm the field strength can not be higher than @xmath91  g. the equipartition magnetic field , the minimum possible value in flare loops , for a @xmath92  k particle distribution with density @xmath44  @xmath5 , is @xmath93  g. note that synchrotron photons of energy 4.8 ghz in a @xmath94 g field must have been produced by @xmath76 gev electrons .",
    "efficient particle acceleration may occur , e.g. , at the proplyd surface , from flow amplification of even very weak ambient magnetic fields followed by local reconnection events ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the flux density from a homogeneous sphere with diameter @xmath95 due to synchrotron radiation in a uniform field and a low energy cutoff @xmath96 in units mev of a @xmath97 particle distribution with @xmath98 spectral index power law , which we use as a reasonable assumption here .",
    "] is given by ( e.g. dulk 1985 ) @xmath99 the non - thermal electrons might have been energized by e.g. shock acceleration or magnetic reconnection events , out of the pool of thermal particles , or they may be galactic cosmic rays penetrating the starforming region . in the latter case @xmath100@xmath5 and @xmath101 , and thus @xmath102  g ( for @xmath103 ) . for the former case , because energy is conserved , the production efficiency of the high energy particles is related to the properties of the thermal background particles , and vice versa .",
    "realistic non - linear diffusive particle acceleration scenarios typically yield @xmath104 ( i.e. the fraction of total electrons which end up with high energies ; e.g. @xcite ) , while magnetic reconnection might be as efficient as @xmath105 for the present densities and temperature @xcite .",
    "since the thermal electron density @xmath106 can not be significantly smaller than @xmath107 @xmath44@xmath5 ( derived from [ sii ] line ratios ; see sect.3.4 ) , and @xmath108 if thermal and non - thermal electrons have the same source , we find that the size of the actual magnetized volume emitting non - thermal radiation must be smaller than the appearance of the on the sky for this case . if particle trapping is at work , @xmath109 is possible , and consequently the ratio of emitting to total volume of the becomes even smaller .",
    "the present data , however , do not allow to quantitatively constrain the actual size of the source responsible for the non - thermal radiation .",
    "we note that the recent discovery of variable x - ray emission from some proplyds in orion by @xcite support the idea of a non - thermal emission volume smaller than the appearance of the on the sky .",
    "the size of the emitting region was estimated on the basis of variability arguments to order 110 au .",
    "the three massive ( @xmath6110  ) nebulae in ngc  3603 , which have recently been discovered by @xcite , have been clearly detected and resolved with the _ atca _ at 3 and 6  cm , with one of them likely to be composed of two cometary - shaped objects .",
    "their flux densities are about 1020 times higher than expected from the  measurements , and a non - thermal average spectrum can be associated with at least one of the three sources .",
    "this is the first time that non - thermal radio emission has been detected from sources .",
    "our spectral index maps show that the emission region is rather inhomogeneous , with negative spectral indices in the tail and part of the head whereas positive spectral indices , indicating thermal free - free emission , tend to be detected from a small region facing the star cluster .",
    "we show that synchrotron emission from a magnetized , relativistic , non - thermal particle population may explain the non - thermal spectral regions .",
    "energetic electrons necessary for synchrotron radiation may be produced through shocks or by magnetic reconnection out of the pool of thermal particles , or may be galactic cosmic rays .",
    "a stellar origin of the observed flux densities appears unlikely considering that the sources are extended .",
    "thus magnetic fields , which have been neglected in proplyd models so far , are possibly associated with the proplyd envelopes or disks , and appear to be crucial in understanding the physical processes in these objects .",
    "@xcite have shown that an inhomogeneous dust distribution in ngc  3603 causes increasing extinction with distance from the star cluster .",
    "in particular , the extinction at the location of the s is estimated to lie between @xmath111 mag .",
    "extinction estimates derived from the radio- to -luminosity ratio are 12 magnitudes higher",
    ".    the ultimate discovery of the so - far undetected disks , which are thought to be part of all proplyds , would give important hints about the origin of the extremely high and non - thermal radio fluxes and the nature of the cometary - shaped clumps seen in ngc  3603 .",
    "this may be accomplished in future mm observations with an upgraded .",
