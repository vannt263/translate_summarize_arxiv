    "understanding the generation of system - size magnetic fields in natural objects , i.e.  fields with a significant component on the scale of the objects themselves , remains an outstanding problem in geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "such fields are maintained by dynamo action , whereby the magnetic induction produced by the motions of an electrically conducting fluid compensates the losses due to ohmic dissipation .",
    "typically , in planetary and stellar interiors , the inductive motions are driven by thermal convection .",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated that rotating convection can indeed generate magnetic fields on a scale large compared with that of the convective cells  see , for example , the spherical shell simulations of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the plane layer computations of @xcite .",
    "however , relating the findings of numerical models to dynamos in the convective cores of rapidly rotating bodies , such as planets , is not entirely straightforward . in computational models ,",
    "it is not currently feasible to achieve values of the ekman number ( @xmath2 , a measure of viscous to rotational forces ) smaller than @xmath3 , whereas in the earth , for example , @xmath4 .",
    "the horizontal extent of convective cells , which depends on the ekman number as @xmath5 , is therefore expected to be much smaller in nature than in the numerical models ; this has important consequences for magnetic field generation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . for rapidly rotating planets ,",
    "the magnetic reynolds numbers ( @xmath6 , the ratio of ohmic decay time to induction timescale ) are expected to be of the order of at the system size ; calculated on the small convective scale though , @xmath1 is much less than unity , i.e.  ohmic diffusion acts much faster than magnetic induction . in this case ,",
    "any large - scale magnetic field can only be generated by the small - scale convective vortices if they act collectively to produce a mean - field @xmath7-effect @xcite .",
    "however , the large - scale magnetic field sustained by this process tends to be spatially uniform ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unlike the observed geomagnetic field . in computational models , which necessarily have to consider much higher values of @xmath2 than the true planetary values , the fundamental problem of very small @xmath1 on the convective scale is therefore implicitly avoided .",
    "that said , the dynamos that result are viscously dominated , with the generated magnetic field having little effect on the convection @xcite ; @xcite thus make the important point that the prominent role of viscosity in the simulations may call into question their direct application to the geodynamo , for which it is typically assumed that viscous effects are negligible .",
    "the main challenge of planetary dynamo theory is therefore to explain the generation of system - size magnetic fields of strong amplitude and complex spatio - temporal variations , while @xmath1 at the convective scale is smaller than unity .",
    "one plausible solution to this problem is that in rapidly rotating convection , the small - scale convective vortices might transfer part of their energy to larger - scale flows ; if @xmath1 is sufficiently high , based on this increased scale , then the dynamo could operate at these larger scales .",
    "the possible formation of large - scale flows is therefore of great interest for the dynamics of planetary interiors .",
    "computationally , this represents a challenging problem , with large domains required that can accommodate many convective cells , together with any large - scale structure that may emerge ; as such , studies to date have concentrated on the computationally economical planar geometry .",
    "recently , a number of independent numerical studies of plane layer , non - magnetic , rapidly rotating convection  both boussinesq and compressible  have demonstrated how large - scale vortices ( lsvs ) can form through the long - term concerted action of the reynolds stresses resulting from the small - scale convective cells @xcite .",
    "the lsvs are long - lived , box - size , depth - invariant vortices , which form by the clustering of small - scale convective vortices ; their horizontal flows are of much larger amplitude than the underlying convective flows .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagram_lsv ] , based on the results of @xcite , shows the domain of existence of lsvs for rotating , plane layer , boussinesq convection , in the parameter space ( @xmath8 ) ; the rayleigh number , @xmath9 , measures the ratio of buoyancy driving to dissipative effects , with @xmath10 the critical value at the onset of convection .",
    "the colour of the circles denotes the value of the local rossby number , @xmath11 , the ratio of the rotation period to the turnover timescale of the convective vortices .",
    "@xmath11 is an inverse measure of the rotational constraint on the convective flow ; it thus increases with @xmath9 .",
    "the area of the circles provides a measure of the relative amplitude of the lsvs , quantified by the ratio @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the root mean square ( rms ) value of the total flow and @xmath14 is the rms value of the vertical flow .",
    "since the flows in lsvs are essentially horizontal , they are characterised by values of @xmath15 larger than unity .",
    "there are two essential conditions for the formation of an lsv , highlighted by figure  [ fig : diagram_lsv ] .",
    "one is that the convective flows must be sufficiently energetic to cluster ; for the parameter values considered in @xcite , this may be expressed by the condition @xmath16 .",
    "the other is that the convective flows are rotationally constrained and anisotropic , i.e.  narrow in the horizontal directions and tall in the vertical direction ; this may be expressed by the condition @xmath17 .",
    "lsvs thus appear for low ekman numbers and large reynolds numbers ( @xmath18 , the ratio of viscous timescale to convective turnover time ) , precisely the conditions under which convection takes place in planetary cores .",
    "lsvs could therefore be good candidates to drive planetary dynamos if they can efficiently generate magnetic fields on scales comparable with or larger than that of the lsvs themselves .",
    ", for @xmath19 and an aspect ratio of @xmath20 .",
    "the colour scale gives the value of the local rossby number , @xmath11 , and the area of the circle is proportional to @xmath15 , which is a measure of the relative strength of the horizontal flows .",
    "the grey area indicates the region where lsvs form.,width=302 ]    the question of whether lsvs can indeed drive a dynamo was addressed in the short paper by @xcite . by extending the hydrodynamic study of @xcite",
    ", it was found that rotating convection in the presence of lsvs can indeed generate a magnetic field with a significant large - scale component .",
    "the field is concentrated in the shear layers surrounding the lsvs and is mainly horizontal . a coherent mean ( i.e.  horizontally averaged ) magnetic field",
    "is also maintained by the flow .",
    "this large - scale dynamo process operates only for a range of magnetic reynolds numbers ; @xmath6 must be large enough for dynamo action to ensue , but small enough that a small - scale magnetic field can not be permanently sustained by the convective flows .",
    "the latter is an essential condition for this particular type of dynamo , since small - scale magnetic fields appear to suppress systematically the formation of the lsv .",
    "indeed , the ability of a small - scale field to disrupt large - scale coherent flows would seem to be a fairly robust characteristic of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence ; for example , in a two - dimensional @xmath21-plane model , @xcite found that small - scale fields  resulting from the distortion of a very weak large - scale field  suppress the generation of the zonal flows that would otherwise form spontaneously . in the large - scale dynamos considered by @xcite ,",
    "the influence of the small - scale magnetic field varies in time , resulting in large temporal oscillations of the kinetic and magnetic energies .",
    "a large - scale magnetic field is first generated by the joint action of the lsv and the smaller - scale convection flow ; this large - scale field is then distorted by the convective flows into a small - scale field , which , subsequently , quenches the lsv and triggers the decay of the whole field ; once the field is small enough , however , the lsv is able to regenerate and the cycle starts again .",
    "since lsvs consist essentially of horizontal flows , they can not of themselves act as dynamos @xcite ; nonetheless , for convenience , we shall refer to this type of dynamo as an ` lsv dynamo ' , even though it does not rely solely on the lsv .",
    "the present paper builds extensively on @xcite by exploring the lsv dynamo in depth .",
    "we concentrate on the lowest value of @xmath2 considered in @xcite , thus allowing a wide - ranging exploration in @xmath9 and @xmath6",
    ". the goals of our study are : ( i ) to investigate in detail how the lsv dynamo mechanism operates ; ( ii ) to constrain the parameter region where this dynamo operates , in order to determine its relevance for planetary dynamos ; and ( iii ) to explain the mechanism by which the small - scale magnetic field suppresses the lsv .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . the mathematical formulation of the problem is given in  [ sec : math ] .",

    "[ fig : diagram ] , we have identified three very distinct types of dynamo .",
    "this feature is illustrated clearly in figure  [ fig : wz_bx ] , which shows the axial vorticity and the @xmath23-component of the magnetic field for representative cases of each type of dynamo . in the following subsections",
    "we explore in some detail the characteristics of the flow and magnetic field for these three dynamo mechanisms .      for rayleigh numbers just above @xmath10",
    ", the convection takes the form of elongated columns , which have a small horizontal cross - section and are aligned with the rotation axis . in the non - magnetic case ,",
    "the integral convective wavenumber ( defined by ( [ eq : kh ] ) ) is @xmath82 for @xmath83 . for this rayleigh number ,",
    "the convective flows maintain a dynamo for @xmath84 , which corresponds to @xmath85 .",
    "the magnetic field is dominated by a mean ( i.e.  horizontally - averaged ) component ; this is clearly seen in the horizontal cross - section of @xmath86 in figure  [ fig : bx_onsdyn ] .",
    "note that , owing to the magnetic boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bc_b ] ) , the mean field can have only a horizontal component .",
    "this type of large - scale dynamo , which operates near the onset of convection , was first described analytically by @xcite and @xcite , and was later studied through detailed numerical simulations of rotating convection by @xcite and by consideration of specific flow planforms by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "details of this dynamo are recalled here for comparison with the dynamos found at larger values of @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamo process works as a two - scale mechanism , whereby the mean field is generated by the electromotive force ( emf ) produced by the collective action of small - scale convective columns .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsdynamo_b ] shows the vertical structure of the mean magnetic field @xmath87 , revealing a spiral staircase structure that is anti - symmetric with respect to the mid - plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsdynamo_c ] shows the space - time diagram of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the components of the mean field have a well - defined periodicity corresponding to a clockwise rotation of the entire staircase structure , with the maxima moving in time from the boundaries towards the mid - plane @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , the green dashed line represents the transition between the regime of this mean - field , large - scale dynamo found close to the onset of convection and a regime in which there is no dynamo action ; this boundary was deduced from consideration of the kinematic dynamo growth rates of neighbouring points in parameter space .",
    "the most significant , and somewhat counter - intuitive , feature of this dynamo is that increasing the rayleigh number , and hence the strength of the convection and the magnetic reynolds number , eventually kills off the dynamo process .",
    "mean - field dynamo action relies crucially on a high degree of spatial and temporal coherence of the small - scale velocity in order to provide an effective emf ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "as the convection becomes more vigorous , although there is more kinetic energy available to drive a dynamo , the coherence of the convective columns is lost , leading to the failure of the large - scale dynamo @xcite .",
    "critically , this occurs even though the convective vortices remain rotationally constrained .",
    "hence this large - scale dynamo is confined very close to the onset of convection , i.e.  @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "provided the magnetic reynolds number is sufficiently high , the convective flows that are unable to generate a mean ( large - scale ) magnetic field are then able to generate only small - scale fields ( i.e.  fields with a size comparable with or smaller than the convective scale ) @xcite .      for sufficiently large thermal driving , an lsv forms in non - magnetic , rapidly rotating convection ; an example is shown in figure  [ fig : wz_lsvdyn ] .",
    "the lsv consists of a concentrated cyclone and a more dilute anticyclone ; details of the formation and stability of the lsv are discussed in detail in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . starting from such convective flows , two very different types of dynamo",

    "is also plotted .",
    "as expected from inspection of the magnetic energy spectrum , both @xmath71 and @xmath73 increase with @xmath92 . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the integral magnetic wavenumbers are smaller than the convective wavenumber , so most of the magnetic energy is contained in the large scales . also in these cases , @xmath71 is systematically smaller than @xmath73 , so the horizontal magnetic field is dominated by scales larger than those of the vertical field . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the integral magnetic wavenumbers are larger than the convective wavenumber , so most of the magnetic energy is contained in scales smaller than the convective scale ; we refer to these dynamos as _ small - scale _ dynamos . in these cases ,",
    "the integral wavenumbers of the horizontal and vertical magnetic fields are comparable .",
    "hence there is a transition from a dynamo that generates a large - scale magnetic field ( i.e.  an lsv dynamo ) to a small - scale dynamo ; for this particular rayleigh number ( @xmath105 ) , the transition occurs for @xmath92 in the range @xmath106 .",

    "@xcite argued that it is the generation of the small - scale magnetic field that yields the suppression of the lsvs .",
    "we study this question in detail in ",

    "indeed , the presence of the lsv is vital to the generation of the large - scale magnetic field , as we shall see in  [ sec : mechanism ] .    to conclude this section , we determine the boundaries in parameter space of small - scale and lsv dynamo action .",
    "first we calculate the small - scale dynamo threshold . to do this , we perform simulations in a box of aspect ratio @xmath113 , chosen to be sufficiently small that no lsv forms , as can be seen from the horizontal cross - sections of the axial vorticity shown in figure  [ fig : wz_l025 ] .",

    "the magnetic energy decays , whereas for @xmath115 , the magnetic energy increases and eventually saturates .",
    "the sustained magnetic field is dominated by small scales .",
    "the small - scale dynamo threshold is thus located between @xmath116 and @xmath117 . to complete the diagram of figure  [ fig : diagram ] , we computed dynamo simulations with @xmath113 for a range of @xmath9 .",
    "from these we find that the small - scale dynamo threshold is always in agreement with the dynamo transition identified earlier for @xmath52 , which was calculated by comparing the integral convective and magnetic wavenumbers ( marked as diamonds in figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "the boundary between the two types of dynamo corresponds to the line where @xmath118 ; this is plotted in figure  [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "we can also define a local magnetic reynolds number , @xmath119 .",
    "the curve @xmath120 lies close to that of @xmath121 for all @xmath9 , since the integral convective wavenumber remains close to @xmath122 for @xmath9 increasing up to @xmath123 .",
    "the small - scale dynamo threshold can therefore be defined equivalently by the local magnetic reynolds number taking the value @xmath124 .",
    "this threshold is independent of the formation of the lsv and , indeed , exists for @xmath125 , where no lsvs are present .",
    "the lower threshold of the lsv dynamo is determined from consideration of kinematic dynamo action as @xmath92 is decreased ; this is shown as the red dashed line in figure  [ fig : diagram ] . for @xmath126 ,",
    "the threshold remains fixed at @xmath127 , at least up to the highest rayleigh number calculated , @xmath128 . for larger @xmath9 , there are two reasons why the lsv dynamo might fail : the lsvs themselves might cease to exist at large rossby number ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagram_lsv ] ) , or the small - scale dynamo threshold intersects that of the lsv dynamo . from hydrodynamical simulations , the strength of the lsv",
    "declines when the local rossby number , @xmath11 , exceeds a value of about @xmath129 . for the ekman number considered here , this occurs for @xmath130 ( i.e.  @xmath131 ) .",
    "since it was not possible to pursue dynamo simulations for @xmath132 , we were unable to locate directly the intersection of the small - scale and lsv dynamo thresholds .",
    "however , we could perform hydrodynamical simulations for larger @xmath9 , up to @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , thereby allowing us to make a prediction about the demise of the lsv dynamo under the assumption that the small - scale dynamo threshold continues to obey @xmath124 for @xmath135 .",
    "we find that this boundary intersects the line @xmath127 for some value of @xmath9 in the range @xmath136 .",
    "for this value of @xmath2 , the two critical rayleigh numbers  one marking the demise of the lsv , the other the preference for small - scale dynamo action  are , coincidentally , of the same order of magnitude .",
    "lsvs , which consist predominantly of horizontal flows , do not of themselves act as a dynamo .",
    "there are therefore two possible mechanisms for the generation of large - scale magnetic field by an lsv dynamo .",
    "one is that the small - scale three - dimensional flows are modified crucially by the lsv in such a way that they are able to support dynamo action  recall that in this parameter regime , small - scale dynamo action without the influence of the lsv is not supported .",
    "the alternative is that lsv dynamo action arises through an essential combination of the lsv and the three - dimensional flows . in this section",
    ", we examine the elementary components of the lsv dynamo mechanism by considering filtered versions of the velocity field , as described in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to study the kinematic dynamo problem for velocity fields obtained from the full convective velocity by the removal of selected spectral modes , with the aim of identifying which modes are the key players in the dynamo process .",
    "note that only the velocity is filtered ; the induction equation is then solved using the filtered velocity , but retaining all modes in the description of the magnetic field . in order to examine the importance of various modes in the velocity , we perform three different types of filtration : the removal of the lsv mode ( lsv filtering ) , the removal of modes at high wavenumbers ( short - wavelength filtering ) and the removal of modes at low wavenumbers ( long - wavelength filtering ) .",
    "we consider these separately in  ",

    "we first examine the role played by the lsv in the dynamo process : in particular , does the lsv velocity field contribute directly to the magnetic induction , or does it play a more subtle role through modifying the smaller - scale flows in such a way that they become favourable to dynamo action ? to address this question , we consider the velocity field obtained by removing only the modes from the velocity ( lsv filtering ) .",
    "a snapshot of this filtered flow is shown in figure  [ fig : wz_filter_f ] , illustrating that the effect of the lsv on the rest of the flow is kept intact ; for comparison , the unfiltered flow is shown in figure  [ fig : wz_filter_a ] .",
    "the result of the kinematic dynamo simulation is shown in figure  [ fig : me_filter_b ] ( labelled lsv - filter ) , leading to the interesting result that the filtered flow fails to act as a dynamo . consequently , despite its inability to sustain a dynamo by itself , the lsv must play a critical role in the magnetic induction ; in particular , its importance for dynamo action is not confined to its hydrodynamical influence on the other parts of the flow .",
    "we now consider the nature of the dynamo action that arises from short - wavelength filtration of the velocity field .",
    "the cutoff horizontal wavenumber is denoted by @xmath140 : all the spectral modes for which either or are set to zero .",
    "examples of short - wavelength filtered flows are shown in figures  [ fig : wz_filter_b]-[fig : wz_filter_c ] .",

    "the magnetic energy is essentially neither decreasing nor increasing , i.e.  this case is close to the dynamo threshold . for @xmath147 , the dynamo fails .",
    "the intermediate modes of scale between that of the box size and that given by @xmath148 are therefore absolutely vital for dynamo action at @xmath137 .",
    "visual comparison of a flow that is capable of dynamo action ( figure  [ fig : wz_filter_b ] for @xmath145 ) with one that is not ( figure  [ fig : wz_filter_c ] for @xmath149 ) , suggests that the elongated flow structures that are produced by the horizontal shear from the lsv might be crucial for the dynamo process .",
    "figure  [ fig : b_filter_b ] shows the structure of the horizontal magnetic field for the filtered simulation with @xmath143 ; for comparison , the field produced by the unfiltered flow in the kinematic case is shown in figure  [ fig : b_filter_a ] .",
    "the plotted quantity is a snapshot of , twice the depth - averaged horizontal magnetic energy . as in the unfiltered case ,",
    "the horizontal magnetic field appears on a large scale and is organised into bands around the cyclone .",
    "however , unlike the unfiltered case , the horizontal field is also strong in the core of the cyclone .",
    "this observation indicates that magnetic induction does occur in the core of the cyclone , but that the small - scale components of the unfiltered flow ( i.e.  @xmath150 ) must subsequently expel the magnetic field from the core into the shear layer .",
    "the destruction of the field inside the core of the cyclone is portrayed in figure  [ fig : bave ] , which shows the time - averaged values of and in a given horizontal slice , for different filtered simulations as well as for the unfiltered case . since here",
    "we are considering kinematic dynamos , the values of and have been normalised by their maximum value at each timestep before averaging .",
    "the time averages are taken over @xmath151 snapshots , during which the lsv drifts slightly in the horizontal plane ; this explains why the averaged values are not as sharp as in the snapshot of figure  [ fig : b_filter ] . for @xmath152 ,",
    "both the horizontal and vertical magnetic fields are concentrated mainly in the cyclone . as the filtration is relaxed ( @xmath153 ) ,",
    "the horizontal and vertical magnetic fields are expelled from the core of the cyclone .",
    "it is therefore the flow corresponding to large wavenumbers ( @xmath154 ) that leads to the magnetic flux expulsion .",
    "the dilute large - scale anticyclone always corresponds to a region of weak magnetic field ; here , the horizontal shear is weaker than in the concentrated large - scale cyclone and seems unable to promote field amplification .      in performing long - wavelength filtration , the amplitudes of the modes for which either or are set to zero , except , crucially , for the modes corresponding to the large - scale flow , i.e.  .",
    "we have seen from  [ sec : lsv ] that the lsv plays a critical role in the magnetic induction .",
    "the aim here therefore is to determine whether a large - scale dynamo of ` @xmath155 ' type is at work , i.e.  a two - scale dynamo driven by a combination of the shearing at large scale ( the @xmath156-effect ) and the production of a coherent emf by interactions of the small scales ( the @xmath7-effect ) .",
    "examples of flows obtained from a long wavelength filtration are shown in figures  [ fig : wz_filter_d]-[fig : wz_filter_e ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : me_filter_b ] shows the temporal evolution of the magnetic energy from a series of filtered simulations in which the cutoff wavenumber is varied from @xmath145 to @xmath157 . for @xmath158",
    "the dynamo fails , but with @xmath157 the flow is able to sustain a magnetic field .",
    "these experiments thus demonstrate that the dynamo requires the presence of intermediate scales up to @xmath159 , i.e.  a scale somewhat larger than a characteristic convective scale ( see figure  [ fig : scales_ra5e8 ] ) , but that larger scales ( with the exception of @xmath111 ) are not necessary for dynamo action at @xmath137 .",
    "there is therefore no rigorous scale separation between that of the shear exerted by the lsv and that of the modes that are significant for dynamo action ( @xmath160 ) ; as such , this dynamo can not strictly be categorised as an @xmath155-dynamo .",
    "figure  [ fig : b_filter_c ] shows the structure of the horizontal magnetic field for the case @xmath157 .",
    "the field is similar to that produced in the unfiltered case , with bands of strong magnetic intensity concentrated in the shear layers surrounding the lsv , and with no magnetic field in the core of the cyclone .",
    "in  [ sec : ttd ] we demonstrated the existence of a transition between an lsv dynamo and a small - scale dynamo as @xmath92 is increased for a given convective flow . in this section",
    "we look in detail at the physical processes underlying this marked change in the nature of the dynamo , and in particular at how the lsv can be suppressed by the small - scale magnetic field . in   [ sec : ttd ] , [ sec : mechanism ] we focused attention chiefly on the spatial characteristics of the generated magnetic fields . here , in order to gain an understanding of the transition between lsv and small - scale dynamos , we first consider the detailed temporal evolution of dynamos at different @xmath92 . in  [ sec:5.1 ] we consider the case of @xmath100 , for which the lsv is destroyed , and for which dynamo action is unambiguously small - scale . in  [ sec:5.2 ] we consider the same convective flow but with @xmath94 , which gives rise to an lsv dynamo",
    ". however , even in this case , the lsv feels the influence of the small - scale magnetic field , leading to temporal variations in the strength of the lsv .",
    "then , in  [ sec:5.3 ] , we explore the underlying physical processes by which the magnetic field can influence , or even destroy , the lsv .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the dynamo resulting from the convective flow with @xmath93 and @xmath100 ; as can be seen from figure  [ fig : diagram ] , it lies well within the small - scale dynamo regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : oscillations_ra5e8_pm25 ] shows the time series of the kinetic and magnetic energies of the horizontal wavenumbers @xmath98 ( for the magnetic field only ) , @xmath111 and @xmath161 .",
    "the initial condition is one of purely hydrodynamic convection , to which a seed magnetic field is added at @xmath162 .",
    "when the magnetic energy grows to a sufficiently large value , the kinetic energy of the lsv ( @xmath111 ) decays rapidly , before reaching a new saturated level , more than two orders of magnitude smaller than in the hydrodynamical case . in the meantime , the kinetic energy of the modes with @xmath161 decreases by about @xmath163 , which is mainly attributable to the decrease in the energy of modes @xmath164 . in the saturated phase ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the mode @xmath111 is smaller than the total energy of the other modes by a factor of @xmath165 ( see also the kinetic energy spectra of figure  [ fig : specu_ra5e8 ] ) .",
    "although the magnetic field does not completely eliminate the kinetic energy at the largest scale , no coherent lsv is apparent .",
    "the magnetic field therefore has an unfavourable effect on the lsv , while leaving the amplitude of the convective flows relatively unchanged .",
    "since no large - scale magnetic field is generated by this dynamo , the unavoidable conclusion is that the small - scale field is responsible for the suppression of the lsv .",
    "it is of interest to note that this suppression does not require a strong magnetic field ; at the point when the amplitude of the lsv starts to decrease , the magnetic energy is only about a tenth of the kinetic energy of the convective flow .",
    "here we consider the same convective flow as in ",
    "[ sec:5.1 ] ( i.e.  @xmath105 ) , but at the much lower magnetic prandtl number of @xmath94 .",
    "time series of the kinetic and magnetic energies are shown in figure  [ fig : oscillations_ra5e8_pm02 ] ; in contrast to figure  [ fig : oscillations_ra5e8_pm25 ] , only the saturated ( dynamic ) phase is shown , because the kinematic dynamo growth rate is slow .",
    "large oscillations in the kinetic energy of the lsv are observed , while the kinetic energy of the modes with @xmath161 remains relatively unchanged .",
    "the oscillations are absent in the purely hydrodynamic case , and so are indisputably of magnetic origin . oscillations of the magnetic energy are associated with the oscillations of the lsv , and are roughly anticorrelated .",
    "the duration and amplitude of these oscillations varies , those with the largest variation having the longest duration .",
    "in contrast to the flow , all scales of the magnetic field are affected by the oscillations , with a seemingly similar evolution . once the magnetic field is amplified to a critical strength by the dynamo",
    ", the lsv decays , leading to the decrease of the magnetic field at all scales .",
    "subsequently , once the field becomes sufficiently weak , the lsv regenerates , eventually leading to a new phase of growth of the magnetic field . in the lsv dynamo",
    " for which @xmath6 is below the threshold for small - scale dynamo action  the small - scale magnetic field is produced by the interactions of the large - scale field with the convective flows .",
    "the evolution of the small - scale field therefore closely follows that of the large - scale field . for @xmath100",
    ", the suppression of the lsv can be attributed solely to the small - scale field ; it is plausible that this is also the case for the dynamo at @xmath94 , although the direct influence of the large - scale field can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "figure  [ fig : oscillations_e ] shows the amplitude of the oscillations of the energies for both the lsv dynamos and small - scale dynamos . for comparison ,",
    "the oscillations of the kinetic energy in the absence of the magnetic field are also shown in grey .",
    "the transition between the two types of dynamo is identified by the line @xmath121 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "the oscillations of both energies are largest for small @xmath92 . indeed , for small @xmath92",
    ", the maximum value of the kinetic energy can even attain the level of the purely hydrodynamic case , implying that the lsv is temporarily fully restored .",
    "as @xmath92 increases , however , the maximum of the kinetic energy remains well below the hydrodynamic level .",
    "for the lsv dynamos , the maximum of the magnetic energy is comparable at all values of @xmath92 and equal to the maximum value of the magnetic energy just above the small - scale dynamo threshold .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of a critical value of the magnetic field for which the lsv is systematically disrupted .",
    "as @xmath92 increases , this critical value is reached more quickly ; as such , the suppression of the lsv occurs before it can reach its full amplitude .",
    "consequently the oscillations tend to have shorter duration as @xmath92 increases .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the physical processes underlying the suppression of the lsv by the magnetic field .",
    "there are two possible mechanisms : ( i ) the magnetic field destroys the reynolds stresses that are the source terms of the lsv by decreasing either their amplitude or their spatio - temporal coherence , or ( ii ) the maxwell stresses cancel out the reynolds stresses . to investigate how the reynolds stresses are modified in the presence of the magnetic field",
    ", we focus on two velocity components of the lsv , and .",
    "the equations for the temporal evolution of and are @xmath166 where the components of the reynolds and maxwell stresses are respectively @xmath167 and where we have assumed that @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "the velocity and magnetic fields are decomposed into @xmath108-average and @xmath108-dependent parts , where @xmath170 .",
    "the stress components @xmath171 and @xmath172 can then be decomposed into @xmath173    .,width=264 ]    figure  [ fig : stress ] shows the time evolution of the rms values of @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 for the small - scale dynamo at @xmath105 and @xmath100 .",
    "this time series can be compared with the evolution of the energies in figure  [ fig : oscillations_ra5e8_pm25 ] .",
    "since the magnetic field does not have a large - scale component , the rms value of @xmath178 is small and is not plotted in figure  [ fig : stress ] .",
    "as expected , the self - interaction of the lsv , represented by @xmath174 , decreases by about two orders of magnitude when the velocity of the lsv decreases by an order of magnitude .",
    "the driving term of the lsv is @xmath175 , which represents the interaction of @xmath108-dependent vortices @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath175 remains at the same level in the presence of the magnetic field but its temporal variations change , marked in particular by the disappearance of the high frequencies . as the magnetic field increases in strength , @xmath176 increases , eventually reaching a level below @xmath175 .",
    "the residual of the components of the reynolds and maxwell stresses , @xmath179 , has the same amplitude as @xmath175 , thereby indicating that the suppression of the lsv is not due to a straightforward cancellation of the reynolds stresses by the maxwell stresses .",
    "instead , therefore , the lsv is suppressed by a modification of the driving term @xmath175 by the magnetic field , although its amplitude remains relatively unchanged .",
    "figure  [ fig : rxy_time ] shows the spatio - temporal evolution of @xmath180 and @xmath181 during the kinematic and saturated phases of the dynamo . to remove the variations of high temporal frequency in the data , we have performed a moving average over @xmath165  time units . during the kinematic phase , @xmath180 and @xmath182 maintain good temporal coherence of the modes @xmath183 and @xmath184 respectively .",
    "the time series is short enough that the lsv does not drift much in the horizontal plane .",
    "the time averages therefore have a well - defined signal at @xmath183 or @xmath184 .",
    "thus , in the kinematic regime , the lsv is forced consistently by the convective vortices . by contrast , during the saturated phase , this temporal coherence is lost , so the lsv can not be forced consistently .",
    "thus , significantly , the demise of the lsv is due not to a reduction in the amplitude of the reynolds stresses that feed the lsv , nor by their cancellation by the maxwell stresses , but instead to the more subtle influence of the small - scale field in hindering the coherence of the reynolds stresses .",
    "in @xcite , we showed how large - scale vortices ( lsvs ) can be spontaneously generated from a hydrodynamical process that consists of the clustering of small - scale , rotationally constrained convective vortices . in this paper , we have explored the dynamo action that may result from turbulent rotating convection in the presence of lsvs . for a range of magnetic reynolds numbers above the critical value for the onset of dynamo action ( @xmath0 for @xmath51 and @xmath19 ) ,",
    "the flow acts to generate a magnetic field with a significant component on scales large compared with the small - scale convective vortices  we denote this as an lsv dynamo .",
    "the dynamo generates magnetic fields that are concentrated in the shear layers surrounding the lsv , together with a coherent mean ( i.e.  horizontally - averaged ) magnetic field . from considering the kinematic dynamo problem with spectrally filtered versions of the velocity , we find that the dynamo mechanism requires only the presence of the lsv together with velocity modes of scale intermediate between the box size and the dominant convective scale",
    ". when the lsv is artificially filtered out from the induction equation but the effect of the lsv on the flow is retained in the momentum equation , the dynamo fails .",
    "consequently , the lsv plays a crucial role in the magnetic induction  importantly , not simply via its action on the smaller scale flows .",
    "the filtered simulations indicate that the magnetic field is generated in the core of the lsv and in the surrounding shear layers , having been expelled from the core by small - scale vortices .    for @xmath1 greater than @xmath185",
    ", the convective flows generate a small - scale dynamo . in this case",
    ", the continuous production of the small - scale magnetic field acts to suppress the lsv completely .",
    "the lsv are produced by the reynolds stresses resulting from the interactions of depth - dependent vortices .",
    "the small - scale magnetic field hinders these interactions , leading to a loss of coherence of the reynolds stresses , and hence an inability to create an lsv .",
    "the lsv dynamo can therefore operate only below the threshold for small - scale dynamo action .",
    "the transition from the lsv dynamo to the small - scale dynamo is continuous . in the lsv dynamo ,",
    "oscillations of the kinetic and magnetic energies are associated with cycles of suppression and regeneration of the lsv .",
    "these oscillations are of magnetic origin , and are due to the amplification of the small - scale magnetic field from the interactions between the large - scale field and the convective flows .    in the cartesian geometry employed here , the lsv dynamo produces a mean horizontal magnetic field with a coherent ` staircase ' structure that rotates overall clockwise .",
    "the spatial and temporal variations of this mean field are more complex than those of the mean field generated by the large - scale dynamo that operates near the onset of convection ( compare , for instance , figure  [ fig : lsdynamo_c ] and figure  [ fig : lsvd_bmean_b ] ) .",
    "this latter dynamo relies on the coordinated action of the convective vortices , and so can operate only for slightly supercritical convection ( up to 50% above the critical rayleigh number for the parameters considered here ) .",
    "its mean field always has a simple spatial structure with a regular time dependence , quite unlike the spatial and temporal variations of planetary magnetic fields . from this point of view , the greater complexity of the mean magnetic field of the lsv dynamo is thus an interesting feature , although the cartesian geometry is inadequate for a comparison with planetary magnetic fields .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of the recent work on lsv formation in rotating convection , together with the resulting dynamos considered in this paper , is the discovery of new physical phenomena at the small values of the ekman number that can now be tackled numerically .",
    "it is instructive to consider how the formation of lsvs and the ensuing dynamos might be affected at yet lower values of @xmath2  though clearly one can not rule out the appearance of further novel behaviour in the considerable gap that exists between what is currently computationally feasible ( @xmath186 ) and what is appropriate for the earth ( @xmath187 ) , for example . in terms of the lsvs ,",
    "it is clear that they require vigorous , yet rotationally constrained turbulence ; as such we can be confident that the range of rayleigh numbers at which lsvs will be found will increase as @xmath2 is decreased , as portrayed in figure  [ fig : diagram_lsv ] .",
    "the issue of the lsv dynamo is , however , less clear - cut .",
    "although we may expect the lsv dynamo to operate for @xmath9 just above the value at which lsv can be formed , it is less straightforward to predict the onset of small - scale dynamo action , and hence the demise of the lsv dynamo .",
    "the set - up considered here  i.e. , a boussinesq fluid in cartesian geometry  forms the simplest system in which to study dynamos driven by rotating convection ; it thus allows for a relatively wide exploration of parameter space .",
    "however , spherical geometry is clearly more appropriate for the study of planetary cores . to date",
    ", lsvs have not been reported in numerical simulations of rotating convection in spherical geometry ; large - scale coherent flows _ are _ observed for low @xmath2 and large @xmath18 , but these are zonal flows  i.e.  axisymmetric and azimuthal jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in terms of rotating convection ,",
    "one of the major differences between cartesian and spherical geometries is the anisotropy caused by spherical geometry in the plane normal to the rotation axis .",
    "this anisotropy constrains the geostrophic flows to be azimuthal , unlike in cartesian geometry , where there is no preferred horizontal direction .",
    "consequently , zonal flows tend to be dominant in rotating spherical convection , provided that the viscous damping from the boundary layers is not too large , i.e.  for stress - free boundary conditions .",
    "interestingly , however , models of barotropic flows on a @xmath21-plane with forced stirring have shown that non - zonal coherent structures of low azimuthal wavenumber can co - exist with dominant zonal jets @xcite .",
    "these large - scale coherent structures take the form of propagating waves , which are believed to be sustained by nonlinear interactions between rossby waves .",
    "one may thus speculate that at sufficiently small values of @xmath2 , large - scale vortices , and the resultant dynamos , may indeed play a role in spherical geometry ; if so , we might expect them to have a propagating nature , a feature that can not be recovered in plane parallel geometry .",
