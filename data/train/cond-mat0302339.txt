    "thermally assisted magnetization reversal has been the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental study for many decades . aside from the relevance of the subject to emerging magnetic technology such as heat - assisted magnetic recording @xcite and thermal stability of magnetic random access memory @xcite , fundamental physics of magnetization reversal process driven by white - noise",
    "is very rich .",
    "classical transition - rate theory of kramer @xcite has supplied a framework in understanding thermal activation of a single domain magnetic element @xcite .",
    "namely , the thermal switching probability @xmath0 can be described by the nel - brown ( nb ) relaxation - time formula , @xmath1 , where the relaxation time is @xmath2 , @xmath3 is an attempt frequency , @xmath4 is the energy barrier , and @xmath5 is the temperature . for a multi - domain structure , the energy surface becomes extremely complicated and identifying energy barriers are numerically non - trivial . nevertheless , with recent development of micromagnetic modeling",
    ", one can understand thermal reversal reasonably well for a not - too - complicated structure @xcite .",
    "an implicit and yet critical assumption in the nb theory is that magnetization dynamics is governed by a torque from an effective magnetic field @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the total magnetic energy , i.e. , the effective field is derivable from the derivative of an energy function with respect to the magnetization vector .",
    "therefore , an energy barrier is well - defined in the nb relaxation formula .",
    "if the torque is not derivable from an energy function , one would expect breakdown of the nb formula .",
    "recently , a new class of torques , called spin transfer torque ( stt ) , has been proposed @xcite and verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "stt is derived from a spin polarized current in magnetic multilayers . for a spin valve structure ,",
    "stt is written as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the strength of stt ; it is proportional to the current density .",
    "@xmath10 is gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath11 is a _ unit _",
    "vector representing the direction of the magnetization of the pinned layer , @xmath12 is the magnetization vector of the free layer and @xmath13 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "if we define an effective field @xmath14 from stt , it is evidently that @xmath15 can _ not _ be written as a total derivative of a function with respect to the magnetization vector , i.e. , there is no well - defined energy associated with the field @xmath16 .",
    "recent experiments @xcite on the thermal effect of the spin torque had also indicated that the thermally assisted magnetization reversal can not be simply described by the nb formula .",
    "et al _ @xcite found that the activation energy strongly depends on the magnitude as well as the direction of the current . to capture the gloss features of the observed experiments",
    ", they have to introduce an effective temperature unrelated to the true temperature in the nb formula .",
    "their proposed effective temperature was then interpreted via a possible magnetic heating and magnetic excitations from the spin transfer torque .",
    "the current directional dependence of the effective temperature indicated that the heating is not of the ordinary current - induced joule heating .",
    "however , no attempt has been made to mathematically link the effective temperature with the spin transfer torque of eq .",
    "the problem of thermally assisted escape process driven by a non - gradient driven force , not derivable from a potential , is an unresolved outstanding problem in statistical physics .",
    "while there are already some efforts to formulate the escape time in this case , the general conclusion is that the law of escape time lacks universality and a variety of scaling relations exist @xcite .",
    "the standard treatment of the thermal escape problem in the presence of a non - gradient field would start from the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation and one numerically solves for the probability distribution @xcite .",
    "this procedure involves proper averaging over the possible escape trajectories .",
    "let us consider the total work done by the conservative torque and the non - conservative stt along an arbitrary trajectory , @xmath17 where we have assumed that the magnetization vector starts at an initial equilibrium point @xmath18 and reaches to an energy saddle point @xmath19 , and we have defined the energy barrier from the conservative torque @xmath20 .",
    "one immediately realizes that @xmath21 defined above depends on the escape trajectory . in the absence of stt ,",
    "one relies on the assumption that the most probable path of the escape is through a minimum energy barrier , i.e. , @xmath22 would be an energy saddle point . in the presence of stt , such assumption breaks down in general . in the present paper",
    "we do not intend to address the general problem of the thermal escape in an open system , rather we want to answer a very focused question : to what extent one can formulate the thermal agitation in terms of a simplified nel - brown activation process and to what accuracy one can analyze the relevant experimental data through a simple effective formula we will develop in the later sections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we propose the stochastic landau - lifshitz equation and its corresponding fokker - planck equation in the presence of the current . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce a stationary solution for the probability density of magnetization by identifying an effective barrier or an effective temperature associated with spin torques . in sec .",
    "iv , we present a numerical calculation to demonstrate the validity of our theory in several realistic cases .",
    "finally , we compare our theory with existing experiments and summarize our theory .",
    "let us first explicitly propose the following generalized stochastic landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation that describes dynamics of the magnetization vector subject to a stt at finite temperatures @xmath23 + \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\gamma $ } _ s,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the damping constant , @xmath25 is the effective magnetic field including the external field , the anisotropy field , the exchange field , and the demagnetization field , and @xmath26 is a fluctuating field with a gaussian stochastic process whose statistical properties are defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are cartesian indices , @xmath30 represents the strength of the thermal fluctuations whose value will be determined later .",
    "@xmath31 denotes an average taken over all realization of the fluctuating field . in the absence of the spin torque , the above equation is the standard stochastic ll equation .",
    "note that we have conveniently dropped the customary renormalized gyromagnetic ratio @xmath32 when compared with the standard landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation .",
    "the critical assumption of our proposed stochastic ll equation , eq .",
    "( 3 ) , is that _ the spin torque does not contain a fluctuating field @xmath26_.",
    "the justification for this choice is that the spin torque comes from the conduction electrons whose transport properties are less affected by thermal fluctuations since the fermi level is much higher than the thermal energy .",
    "therefore , the thermal fluctuation would not appear to affect @xmath9 which represents the strength of the spin torque .",
    "we believe that our proposed stochastic ll equation captures the main random processes induced by thermal fluctuation .",
    "nevertheless , one could , in principle , have introduced a second random field or torques to take into account the fluctuation of the spin torque . in our proposed ll equation , the thermal effect on the spin torque",
    "is only encoded in the dependence of the magnetization vector .    to establish the thermal properties from the above stochastic equation",
    ", one must take a proper thermal average .",
    "fortunately , much of theoretical work on the stochastic ll in the absence of the spin torque had been carried out @xcite . here",
    "we will follow and generalize the procedure pioneered by brown @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath33 as a non - equilibrium probability density for magnetic orientation vectors associated with the stochastic eq .",
    "the rate equation for @xmath33 is @xmath34 where the probability current density @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a short notation for the gradient operator on the magnetization vector @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the diffusion constant whose value is determined by fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in the present case , @xmath38 is related to @xmath30 by @xmath39 .",
    "the above rate equation , eq .  ( 5 ) , is a simple statement for the angular momentum conservation : the change of probability density in an enclosed small volume ( first term ) has to be balanced by the net probability in - flowing flux ( second term ) plus the probability density loss via spin diffusion ( third term ) . by inserting eq .",
    "( 3 ) into eq .  ( 5 ) , after a straightforward but rather tedious algebra manipulation @xcite , the resulting equation is the fokker - planck equation @xmath40 p \\right\\ } \\end{array}\\ ] ] in the absence of the spin torque , i.e. , @xmath41 , the thermal equilibrium distribution density @xmath42 demands to take the form of the boltzmann distribution function , i.e. , @xmath43 where @xmath5 is the temperature and @xmath44 is the energy defined by @xmath45 . inserting this equilibrium @xmath46 into eq .  ( 6 ) , one finds that @xmath47 this is the well - known dissipation - fluctuation relation .",
    "we now postulate that _ the fluctuating field is independent of the spin torque_. this hypothesis is consistent with our notion that the spin torque is a deterministic action so that the spin torque does not alter the randomness induced by the thermal fluctuation . with this identification , the stochastic ll equation , eq .",
    "( 3 ) , and its corresponding fokker - planck equation , eq .",
    "( 6 ) , completely determine the dynamics of the magnetization vector at finite temperature @xmath5 .",
    "before we numerically solve the above stochastic ll equation for a number of interesting cases , we should first look for a stationary solution in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , i.e. , @xmath48 is independent of time . without the spin torque ,",
    "this solution is known as the equilibrium boltzmann distribution function mentioned earlier . with the spin torque ,",
    "the system is no more in an equilibrium state because the system is subject to the spin torque and thus it is not a closed system . for an open system",
    ", the law of thermal dynamics does not require the minimum free energy and the concept of thermal equilibrium breaks down . nevertheless , it is still meaningful to obtain a stationary solution @xmath49 where fokker - planck probability density is time - independent @xmath50 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 p_s \\right\\ } = 0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] unfortunately , the above eigenstate problem for an arbitrary field @xmath25 is generally difficult to solve .",
    "one can immediately verify that the boltzmann probability density @xmath52 is no more a solution of the above equation . to make progress , we need to consider a special case below .",
    "first , we recall that the nel - brown formula for the thermal agitation is in fact most useful where the energy barrier constructed by @xmath25 is much higher than the thermal energy @xmath53 . in this limit",
    ", the probability density will be very small if the direction of the magnetization vector is away from the energy minimum .",
    "here we should also consider this case .",
    "we now tentatively seek a solution of @xmath49 in the form of @xmath54 where we have introduced an effective temperature @xmath55 that will be determined next . by placing this @xmath49 into eq .",
    "( 8) and by utilizing the identity @xmath56 , we find @xmath57 p_s \\right\\ } = 0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] clearly , the above equation does not necessarily have a solution for an arbitrary effective field .",
    "however , as we point out earlier , we have limited ourselves to a high barrier case such that the magnetization vector at the stationary condition is nearly at the direction of @xmath58 . for concreteness ,",
    "let us consider a most experimentally relevant geometry where @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the external field which is applied at x - direction , @xmath62 is the anisotropy field , and @xmath63 is the demagnetization field perpendicular to the plane of the film . in this case , the energy minimum are at @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "we simply keep the first order in @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and set @xmath68 up to the first order , we find @xmath69 and @xmath70 . by placing these expressions into eq .",
    "( 9 ) and carrying out the divergence @xmath36 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 components we find ( one noticed that the divergence operator on @xmath49 produces higher orders since eq .  (",
    "11 ) is already the first order in @xmath66 and @xmath67 , thus it is consistent with our approximation by neglecting the terms of divergence on @xmath49 ) , @xmath71 or @xmath72 where we defined a critical spin torque @xmath73 . coincidentally , this critical spin torque is precisely the minimum spin torque required to switch the magnetization at zero temperature @xcite .    we should point out that the concept of the effective temperature introduced here should be understood in terms of the stationary solution of the probability density .",
    "the thermally averaged dynamical variable , for example , the magnetization vector @xmath74 would behave as if the temperature of the system is @xmath55 .",
    "however , the magnetic temperature which is defined through the thermal fluctuation remains to be @xmath5 .",
    "an alternative understanding of this effective temperature is to rewrite the stationary solution by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an effective activation energy @xmath77 in other word , we can state that the spin torque alters the magnetic energy and thus there will be an effective energy barrier associated with the spin current .",
    "therefore , it is equivalent to think of the effect of the spin torque via the modification of the temperature or of the energy barrier .    to conclude this section ,",
    "we have found a stationary solution @xmath49 of the stochastic ll equation . since the life time or the relaxation time @xmath78 is inversely proportional to the probability density @xmath49",
    ", we can write the generalized brown - nel formula below @xmath79 where @xmath3 is an attempt frequency and @xmath4 is the energy barrier .",
    "the stationary solution , @xmath80 $ ] , is based on the assumption of high energy barrier assumption . in general cases , one should start the calculation of magnetization dynamics from our generalized ll equation , eq .  ( 3 ) . since the stationary solution is simple and easy to use in analyzing experimental data , it would be necessary to establish the range of validity of eq .",
    "( 15 ) for various interesting experimental situations .",
    "once its validity is established , we expect that our stationary solution would be serving as a starting point to understand various thermal agitation phenomena in the present of the current . in this section",
    ", we numerically integrate eq .",
    "( 3 ) and compare the result with @xmath49 .     as a function of the inverse of the temperature for several values of the spin - transfer torques .",
    "the external field of @xmath81 ( oe ) is applied along @xmath82 direction.,width=264 ]    the standard white - noise spectrum , eq .",
    "( 4 ) where @xmath30 is given by eq  ( 7 ) , is used for the modeling of the temperature dependence of random fields .",
    "the calculation procedure is same as that for the standard llg equation , except a spin torque is added to the equation of the motion . a magnetic layer ,",
    "whose lateral size is 64nm@xmath8364 nm and whose thickness is 2.5 nm , is treated as a single macrospin .",
    "the in - plane uniaxial anisotropy field @xmath62 is @xmath84(oe ) and the saturation magnetization is @xmath85 ( oe ) .",
    "these parameters are reasonably consistent with the experiments performed by the cornell group @xcite .",
    "the gilbert damping constant was taken as @xmath86 throughout the modeling .",
    "the magnetization of the free layer is initially saturated at @xmath87 direction . at @xmath88",
    ", we apply a magnetic field at @xmath82 direction whose magnitude is close to but less than the anisotropy field @xmath89 . at the same time , @xmath90 is also applied to the system .",
    "equation ( 3 ) was numerically integrated in time using the stochastic heun method with a 0.3ps time step . a smaller time step has been tested and it yields nearly identical results in all the cases presented in the paper .    with above specified parameters and procedure ,",
    "we first determine the probability @xmath0 that the magnetic layer has been reversed within the waiting time @xmath91 . by performing up to @xmath92 independent runs for each set of parameters ( each run starts at @xmath88 and ends at the time that the magnetization has either been just switched or ends at the time up to @xmath93 , whichever is smaller ) and then by recording the number of them that the magnetization is switched at time interval ( @xmath91 , @xmath94 ) , we obtained a simulated @xmath0 that is fitted by a simple exponential function , i.e. , @xmath95 where @xmath78 is the fitting parameter for the relaxation time .",
    "we have found that the fit works remarkably well for any values of @xmath9 we have considered . in fig .  1 , we show the fitted relaxation time @xmath78 as a function of the temperature for a fixed applied field @xmath96 .",
    "two features are immediately seen : first the data fall on a straight line for any fixed @xmath9 ; this indicates the thermally assisted reversal can be described by an activation process , i.e. , @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to introduce an effective activation energy , see eq .",
    "( 14 ) , in accordance with the nel - brown law of thermal agitation .",
    "the second conclusion is that the slope , or the activation energy depends on stt : the positive @xmath9 favors a lower energy barrier .",
    "all these features are well described by eqs .",
    "( 13)-(15 ) .     as a function of @xmath90 at three different external fields .",
    "inset : @xmath98 vs @xmath99 for several different values of stt.,width=264 ]    in fig .  2 ,",
    "the effective activation energies are shown to be linearly dependent on the current and they vanish at almost the same point @xmath100 for different external fields [ note that @xmath100 is weakly dependent on the external field , see the definition of @xmath100 after eq .",
    "( 13 ) ] . in the insert of fig .  2 , we have shown the activation energy as a function of the magnetic field for several different stt . the activation energy can be fitted by    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the switching field at zero temperature , @xmath103 is the energy barrier at zero magnetic field field , and @xmath104 is a constant , which has been argued to be 1.5 or 2 .",
    "the exponent @xmath105 for the external field applied parallel to the easy axis .",
    "these simulated results confirm our analytical result , eq .",
    "a number of experiments on spin torque induced thermal agitation had been carried out .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether our prediction , eq .",
    "( 15 ) , agrees with these existing data .",
    "the phenomenon that we want to compare first is so - called `` telegraph noises '' or dwell times .",
    "experimentally , one simultaneously applies an external magnetic field and a spin current to a spin valve structure so that the magnetization direction of the free layer is fluctuating from one direction to another due to thermal agitation @xcite . the dwell time @xmath106 @xmath107 is defined as an average time the magnetization of the free layer is parallel ( antiparallel ) to that of the fixed layer . in general , @xmath108",
    "however , by adjusting the magnetic field or the spin current , one is able to obtain an equal dwell time for parallel and antiparallel states , @xmath109 . from eq .",
    "( 15 ) for the parallel and the antiparallel states , the condition of the equal dwell time is @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the critical currents for the magnetization switching from antiparallel to parallel alignments and vice versa ; their magnitudes are not necessary the same , i.e. , @xmath113 in a typical experimental geometry @xcite . to compare our prediction , eq .",
    "( 17 ) , with experiments , we plot the h - i phase diagram of equal dwell time @xmath109 in fig .  3 .    .",
    "the coupling field is @xmath114 , the critical currents are @xmath115 for the transition from ap to p alignments and @xmath116 from p to ap alignments .",

    "square : experimental data @xcite.,width=264 ]    it is noted that we have shifted the external field by @xmath118 to take into account of the magnetic coupling between the free and fixed layers .",
    "the coupling may come from either the exchange or dipolar couplings . since we assume that the magnetization of the fixed layer is held at the direction of @xmath119 , the free layer receives an effective coupling field that will be added to @xmath61 in eq .",
    "evidently , the agreement between our results and the experimental data is excellent @xcite .",
    "next we compare the ratio of the dwell times of antiparallel and parallel states for a fixed magnetic field .",
    "again , from eq .",
    "( 15 ) , we have @xmath120    .",
    "the parameters are same as those in fig.4.,width=264 ]    in fig .  4",
    ", we show the ratio of the dwell times for a fixed magnetic field as a function of the spin torque by using the same set of experimental parameters as in fig .",
    "3 . the results are consistent with experimental data ( however , the data points in ref.@xcite are rather scattered so that i do not include those data in the figure ) .    up till now",
    ", we have studied the thermal activation by _ abruptly _ introducing an external field and a stt at t=0 . in experiments ,",

    "we have verified that the temperature dependence of @xmath132 is a linear relationship and @xmath131 monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "myers _ et al _",
    "@xcite have discovered that the thermal activation driven by spin torque is qualitatively different from that driven by the magnetic field .",

    "in summary , we have extended the law of thermal agitation to include the spin transfer torque driven by the spin polarized current in magnetic multilayers .",
    "although the concept of the energy barrier or the temperature in the nel - brown formula breaks down in the presence of the spin transfer torque , we are able to re - establish the nel - brown formula by properly introducing an activation energy or an effective temperature to replace the true energy barrier or true lattice temperature .",
