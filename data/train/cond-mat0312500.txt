    "there is no reasonable doubt that it was , at least intuitively , neat and clear for ludwig boltzmann and for albert einstein @xcite that statistical mechanics descends , in one way or another , from microscopic dynamics .",
    "it should be so for all essential concepts of the theory , including the celebrated expression for the entropy , namely ( written here for a discrete case ) @xmath2 from now on referred to as the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) entropy .",
    "however , and interestingly enough , it is until now unknown how to start from say newton s law @xmath3 and end up with this remarkable functional form and its associated variational principle .",
    "it is boltzmann s magnificent intuition which made him to propose this specific microscopic expression for clausius thermodynamic entropy .",
    "expression which is totally consistent with newton s law , although rigorously speaking we still do not know why .",
    "if such is the situation for @xmath4 , it is clear that the situation has to be even more intriguing  to say the least !  for any generalization of @xmath4 , such as @xcite @xmath5    even if we do not yet know how @xmath4 descends from dynamics and what restrictive premises the microscopic dynamics must satisfy , it has been profusely verified that @xmath4 is the natural entropic form everytime we have nonintegrable and sufficiently chaotic dynamics ( i.e. , _ positive _ lyapunov exponents ) , known to yield quick mixing and eventually ergodicity in phase space .",
    "a natural question arises : what happens if the system is nonintegrable but _ all _ lyapunov exponents vanish ?",
    "more precisely , what happens when the sensitivity to the initial conditions diverges _ less _ than exponentially ?",
    "it seems plausible to imagine that the answer depends on _ how _ the sensitivity diverges asymptotically , a power - law ?",
    ", a slow logarithmic divergence ?",
    ", some other type ?",
    "the case that we focus on in the present paper , and generically in nonextensive statistical mechanics , is the ubiquitous _ power - law_. it is for such dynamics that one imagines that @xmath6 would be the appropriate physical entropy to be used for various purposes , including the bridging to thermodynamics .",
    "furthermore , one imagines that the appropriate value of the entropic index @xmath1 should reflect the _ exponent _ of the power - law , thus constituting the basis for universality classes of nonextensivity .",
    "although most of the notions that we shall use here occur in all types of dynamics , including quantum ones , we shall focus on classical systems for simplicity .",
    "let us start with the notion of _ sensitivity to the initial conditions_. at the present point it is enough , as an illustration , to consider a one - dimensional nonlinear dynamical system ( e.g. , an unimodal map like the logistic one ) characterized by @xmath7 .",
    "we define the sensitivity ( to the initial conditions ) @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the difference between two trajectories @xmath7 and @xmath10 that are initially close to each other .",
    "the following differential equation is typically satisfied : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lyapunov exponent ( or essentially the largest one in more general situations ) .",
    "the solution of course is @xmath13 hence @xmath14 .",
    "this solution generically holds everytime @xmath15 .",
    "but if we have @xmath16 ( referred to as _ weak chaos _ if there is mixing , and _ integrability _ otherwise ) , we expect the adequate differential equation to typically be the following generalization of eq .",
    "( 3 ) : @xmath17 where _ sen _ stands for _ sensitivity_. its solution is given by @xmath18 hence @xmath19 , with @xcite @xmath20^{1/(1-q ) } \\;\\;\\;\\;(e_1^x = e^x)\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath21 ( we remind that @xmath22 is always real and nonnegative ; for @xmath23 , it vanishes for all values of @xmath24 such that @xmath25 ) .",
    "if @xmath16 and , in spite of that , there is mixing in the full dynamical space of the system , we typically expect @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; if there is no mixing , we typically expect @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is of course possible in even more pathological cases ( and therefore more rare in natural or artificial systems ) that _ both _ @xmath12 and @xmath30 vanish , but such cases are out of the scope of the present discussion , centered on power - laws ( and not on even weaker behaviors such as the logarithmic ones ) .",
    "it is by now well known that an illustration of the situation we are focusing on here is provided by the edge of chaos of the logistic map : @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "many other paradigmatic dynamical systems are known or expected to also enter , in one way or another , into the same category .",
    "this is the case of globally coupled standard maps close to integrability ( @xcite and references therein ) or long - range - interacting many - body hamiltonian systems ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us finally mention that , at least for simple one - dimensional maps , @xmath33 also enters prominently in basic properties such as the entropy production per unit time @xcite ( essentially the kolmogorov - sinai entropy rate ) , and the values at which the multifractal function ( associated with the edge of chaos ) may vanish @xcite .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a macroscopic observable relaxing towards its value at a stationary state ( thermal equilibrium , or some other ) .",
    "the associated differential equation very frequently is @xmath36 @xmath37 being the relaxation time .",
    "the solution of this equation is @xmath38 the quantity @xmath39 is in principle expected to depend on the observable @xmath35 .",
    "however , in all generic cases one expects ( according to krylov s classical remarks ) @xmath40 if @xmath41 .",
    "this is quite natural since the relaxation of a macroscopic quantity reflects nothing but the exploration that the system makes of its full dynamical space in its search of a possible stationary state ( given some class of initial conditions ) , and this occurs at a rythm dictated by the lyapunov exponent @xmath12 ( or , in general , by the full lyapunov spectrum ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath12 ( or the maximal lyapunov exponent ) vanishes , we expect @xmath39 to diverge , thus making eq .",
    "( 11 ) inappropriate .",
    "it is quite plausible that , in such situation , eq .",
    "( 10 ) becomes generalized into @xmath42 where _ rel _ stands for _ relaxation_. the solution is of course given by @xmath43 being typically @xmath44 .",
    "it could well happen that @xmath44 depends on the specific observable @xmath35 we might be interested in , but even if such is the case , we expect all possible @xmath45 s to be simply inter - related .",
    "moreover , we expect them to be essentially characterized by the speed at which the nonlinear dynamics makes the system to approach its stable ( or metastable ) stationary ( or quasistationary ) state , given the class of initial conditions within which the system has been started . more specifically , when @xmath16 , we expect simple hypothesis such as ergodicity in full phase space ( basic for the validity of bg statistical mechanics ) to be not fulfilled .",
    "even more , we expect ( under conditions to be determined ) the system to have a tendency of lengthily living in some kind of attractor or pseudo - attractor , _ whose lebesgue measure in full dynamical space would typically be zero _ , as it is the case of ( multi)fractals or scale - free networks .",
    "if we assume an ensemble whose lebesgue measure is different from zero at @xmath46 inside a special region of full space , we might observe a shrinking of the lebesgue measure as time goes on .",
    "the loss of lebesgue measure would possibly occur through a @xmath1-exponential function whose value of @xmath1 would be noted @xmath45 . from now on ,",
    "we reserve the notation @xmath45 for the shrinking of lebesgue measure , if such is the case .",
    "all other @xmath45 s would be simply related to this one .",
    "let us emphasize that the present scenario does _ not _ exclude that , at even larger times , the system escapes from this ( multi)fractal  prison \" and ultimately satifies ergodicity , thus making a crossover from @xmath45 to @xmath47",
    ". this would in fact be the case unless some limiting situations ( see @xcite ) are taken which strictly guarantee that @xmath12 vanishes .",
    "when such _ escape _ is possible , _ aging _ phenomena might be present @xcite , aging being presumably related to a slow collective dynamics which would prepare the escape from the  prison \" .",
    "a typical illustration of the picture we have described in the present subsection is , as before , the edge of chaos of the logistic map , where it is @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "other paradigmatic illustrations should include the systems mentioned in the previous subsection , but this remains to be verified .",
    "let us finally mention that , at least for simple one - dimensional maps , @xmath45 also emerges @xcite in basic properties such as the fractal dimension ( maximum of the multifractal function ) of the attractor at the edge of chaos .",
    "let us now address what may in some sense be considered as the most useful thermostatistical function , namely the distribution of total energies in gibbs @xmath0-space of a thermodynamical system in contact with a canonical thermostat fixing the temperature @xmath49 .",
    "let us first consider a hamiltonian system whose elements interact only _ locally _ , or almost _ not at all _ ( e.g. , the ideal gas ) .",
    "a typical example of local interaction is a classical two - body ( attractive ) potential which has no singularity at the origin , and which asymptotically decays with distance @xmath50 as @xmath51 with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the space dimension of the system ; for instance , for the usual lennard - jones fluid , we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we know that the relevant stationary state is thermal equilibrium and that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the set of eigenvalues of the hamiltonian with specific boundary conditions .",
    "this celebrated distribution can be obtained through the textbook procedure which consists in optimizing @xmath4 under the constraints @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the total internal energy .",
    "it seems to be realized by only a few physicists that this distribution can _ also _ be obtained , _ albeit _ without formal justification up to now , through a differential equation , namely @xmath61 the black - body radiation law was first found , and published in october 1900 @xcite , by max planck through an heuristic differential equation , precisely one which , with appropriate variables , contains eq .",
    "( 15 ) as a particular case !",
    "this is known only by those interested in the history of science . and",
    "it has not been incorporated in standard textbooks presumably because of the lack of formal justification .",
    "nevertheless the mathematical fact is there , and in my opinion it is perhaps not a mere coincidence .",
    "indeed , since the sensitivity to the initial conditions follows an exponential law , and the same typically does its prominent consequence namely the relaxation of macroscopic thermostatistical quantities , it can not be a very great surprise that the same does happen to the distribution associated with the stationary state towards which the system relaxes .",
    "for hamiltonian systems whose elements do not interact locally but _ globally _ ( e.g. , the classical systems mentioned previously but with @xmath62 , in which case the potential is _ not _ integrable ) , it seems quite plausible that the eq . (",
    "15 ) becomes generalized into @xmath63 where _ stat _ stands for _ stationary state _",
    ", and @xmath64 is the adequate inverse temperature ( in units of @xmath65 ) .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath66 and one typically expects @xmath67 .",
    "it is in fact _",
    "precisely _ this solution which emerges @xcite by optimizing , through conveniently written norm and energy constraints , @xmath6 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "there is molecular dynamical numerical evidence @xcite for some classical long - range - interacting many - body inertial rotators on @xmath53-dimensional lattices that they might satisfy , in some robust metastable states in the presence of a thermostat , the total energy distribution indicated in eq .",
    "but , even at the numerical level , the problem is uneasy , though not impossible , to study .",
    "this is the subject of ongoing efforts .",
    "the strategy which is followed is to consider an isolated system of @xmath68 rotators at a fixed total energy .",
    "then consider once for ever a subset of @xmath69 rotators among the @xmath68 available .",
    "finally , one must numerically approach the @xmath70 limit of the @xmath71 limit of the @xmath72 limit .",
    "the whole procedure must be repeated many times ( @xmath73 , mathematically speaking ) for realizations differing in the precise multi - particle initial conditions , always within some specific and nontrivial class of initial conditions , and then averaging the results .",
    "the distribution obtained in this manner ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) is to be compared with eq .",
    "( 17 ) .",
    "let us make one more remark , which concerns the distributions of momenta of these rotators .",
    "if we denote with @xmath75 the hamiltonian associated with say planar rotators , the distribution in @xmath0-space is given by @xmath76 then the one - body angular momentum marginal distribution @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 we do not yet know what is the result for this distribution but it could also be a @xmath79-exponential in @xmath80 with @xmath81 related to @xmath82 is some still unknown manner .",
    "one expects ( essentially because the integral of a @xmath1-exponential is another @xmath1-exponential ) the index @xmath79 to either coincide with @xmath82 or be a simple function of it ( see @xcite ) . in any case , the available numerical evidence is not inconsistent with such posibilities ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "see , for instance , fig .",
    "1 ( from @xcite ) , where for the first time the momentum distribution is calculated ( through molecular dynamics ) for a system which is sensibly closer to a _ canonical _ ensemble ( contact with a large thermostat ) than the _ microcanonical _ ensemble considered up to now in the literature for such systems .",
    "( i.e. , in @xmath83-space ) , starting with a `` hot water bag '' . in solid black circles , the instantaneous pdf at time @xmath84 ( with @xmath85 ) , for @xmath86 spins inside an @xmath87 spin system . in empty circles , the average of @xmath88 realizations for @xmath89 spins ( all averages made during the @xmath90 plateau ) . in dashed line , the @xmath79-exponential fitting curve with @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    ". finally , in solid line , the analytical gaussian pdf .",
    "these last three curves are the same in every frame , and are plotted for reference . from @xcite.,width=359 ]    , namely those associated with sensitivity to the initial conditions , relaxation and stationary state . for the most relevant situations we expect @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "these indices are presumably inter - related since they all descend from the particular dynamical exploration that the system does of its full phase space .",
    "for example , for long - range hamiltonian systems characterized by the decay exponent @xmath96 and the dimension @xmath53 , it could be that @xmath82 decreases from a value above unity ( e.g. , @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) to unity when @xmath99 increases from zero to unity .",
    "for such systems one expects relations like the ( particularly simple ) @xmath100 or similar ones . in any case , it is clear that , for @xmath52 ( i.e. , when bg statistics is known to be the correct one ) , one has @xmath101 .",
    "all the weakly chaotic systems focused on here are expected to have well defined values for @xmath33 and @xmath45 , but only those associated with a hamiltonian are expected to _ also _ have a well defined value for @xmath82 .",
    ", width=453 ]",
    "the @xmath1-indices discussed in section 2 and their possible interconnections are schematically represented in fig .",
    "2 . it is our scenario that they are different  faces \" of the same basic phenomenon , namely how the system  likes \" to evolve and mix in part or all of its full phase space ( gibbs @xmath0-space for hamiltonian systems ) given its initial conditions .",
    "if the system is strongly chaotic ( i.e. , positive lyapunov exponents ) , essentially satisfying boltzmann s  molecular chaos hypothesis \" , then the system will be mixing and ergodic allover the entire phase space .",
    "bg statistical mechanics is expected to appropriately describe the thermal statistics of the system , the associated microscopic expression for the entropy undoubtedly being @xmath4 .",
    "but if the system is only weakly chaotic ( i.e. , zero lyapunov exponents , but _ not _ integrable ) , then the occupancy of phase space might be much more complex everytime the system is started within specific nonzero - lebesgue - measure regions of phase space .",
    "the region of phase space where the system may lengthily evolve before eventually occupying the entire space might have a ( multi)fractal or hierarchical structure of the type currently referred to as scale - free network ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as long as the system remains in that region , its thermostatistics might be adequately be described within nonextensive statistical mechanics , the associated microscopic expression for the thermodynamic entropy presumably being @xmath6 with a specific value of @xmath1 . during the metastable or quasi - stationary state we would then have @xmath102 , and at later times ( in many cases , infinitely later ! ) a crossover would occur to @xmath101 .",
    "this confluence onto a single value of @xmath1 for bg statistics might be at the origin of occasional confusion within the interested community .",
    "indeed , three essentially different ( though related ) concepts just happen to coincide within the bg formalism .",
    "it is a deep pleasure to thank the creators and organizers of this wonderful meeting in cagliari ( villasimius ) where we all received exceptionally warm hospitality . although they were many and very valuable , it is for me but a matter of elementary justice to gratefully name those who contributed the most : p. quarati , g. kaniadakis , a. rapisarda , m. lissia and e.g.d .",
