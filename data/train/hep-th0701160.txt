    "we can write @xmath39 we think of @xmath40 as the coherent state in @xmath33 ( level @xmath41 matrices ) which is localized at the point @xmath34 of @xmath0 . therefore the coherent state @xmath42 in @xmath32 ( level @xmath43 matrices ) which is localized around the point @xmath34 of @xmath0 is defined by the projector @xmath44 we compute that @xmath45 hence it is natural to identify fuzzy @xmath0 at level @xmath15 ( or @xmath46 ) by the coordinates operators    @xmath47    they satisfy    @xmath48=\\frac{2i}{n}f_{abc}x_c~,~x_a^2=\\frac{4}{3}(1+\\frac{3}{n})~,~d_{abc}x_ax_b=\\frac{2}{3}(1+\\frac{3}{2n})x_c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore in the large @xmath7 limit we can see that the algebra of @xmath49 reduces to the continuum algebra of @xmath50 .",

    "explicitly these are given by @xmath82 in above we have used the fact that the generators in the adjoint representation @xmath83 satisfy @xmath84 .",
    "remark that we have the identities @xmath85 .",
    "hence the condition ( [ cond ] ) takes the natural form @xmath86 this is one condition which allows us to reduce the number of independent components of @xmath71 by one .",
    "we know that there must be three more independent constraints which the tangent field @xmath71 must satisfy since it has only @xmath87 independent components . to find them we start from the identity @xcite @xmath88.\\label{24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath89.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using the fact that @xmath90 we obtain    @xmath91    hence it is a straightforward calculation to find that the gauge field @xmath71 must also satisfy the conditions @xmath92 in the case of @xmath2 the projector @xmath80 takes the simpler form @xmath93 and hence @xmath94 . from equation ( [ plk55 ] )",
    "we have on @xmath0 @xmath95 if we choose to sit on the `` north pole '' of @xmath0 , i.e @xmath96 then we can find that @xmath97 and as a consequence @xmath98 .",
    "so @xmath99 , @xmath100 correspond to the normal directions while @xmath99 , @xmath101 correspond to the tangent directions .    indeed by substituting @xmath96 in equation ( [ cond2 ] ) and using @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 we get @xmath107 which is what we want .",
    "in fact ( [ cond2 ] ) already contains ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "in other words it contains exactly the correct number of equations needed to project out the gauge field @xmath71 onto the tangent bundle of @xmath0 .",
    "let us finally say that given any continuum gauge field @xmath71 which does not satisfy the constraints ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) we can always make it tangent by applying the projector @xmath80 .",
    "thus we will have the tangent gauge field @xmath108 similarly the fuzzy gauge field must satisfy some conditions which should reduce to ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) . as it turns out constructing a tangent fuzzy gauge field using an expression like ( [ cond ] ) is a highly non - trivial task due to @xmath5 gauge covariance problems and @xmath6 operator ordering problems . however implementing ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) in the fuzzy setting is quite easy since we will only need to return to the covariant derivatives @xmath72 and require them to satisfy the @xmath9 identities ( [ idd ] ) , viz @xmath109 so @xmath72 are almost the @xmath9 generators except that they fail to satisfy the fundamental commutation relations of @xmath9 given by equation ( [ comm ] ) .",
    "this failure is precisely measured by the curvature of the gauge field @xmath71 , namely @xmath110+f_{abc}d_c\\nonumber\\\\ & = & i[t_a , a_b]-i[t_b , a_a]+f_{abc}a_c+i[a_a , a_b].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the continuum limit of this object is clearly given by the usual curvature on @xmath0 , viz @xmath111 $ ] . to check that this fuzzy gauge field @xmath71 has the correct degrees of freedom we need to check that the identities ( [ cond3 ] ) reduce to ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) in the continuum limit @xmath112 .",
    "this fact is quite straightforward to verify and we leave it as an exercise .    next we need to write down actions on fuzzy @xmath46 .",
    "the first piece is the usual yang - mills action @xmath113 by construction it has the correct continuum limit .",
    "@xmath114 is the normalized trace @xmath115 .",
    "the second piece in the action is a potential term which has to implement the constraints ( [ cond3 ] ) in some limit .",
    "indeed we will not impose these constraints rigidly on the path integral but we will include their effects by adding to the action a very special potential term .",
    "in other words we will not assume that @xmath72 satisfy ( [ cond3 ] ) .",
    "to the end of writing this potential term we will introduce the four normal scalar fields on fuzzy @xmath46 by the equations ( see equations ( [ cond3 ] ) )    @xmath116    and @xmath117 we add to the yang - mills action the potential term @xmath118 in the limit where the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 are taken to be very large positive numbers we can see that only configurations @xmath71 ( or equivalently @xmath72 ) such that @xmath121 and @xmath122 dominate the path integral which is precisely what we want .",
    "this is the region of the phase space of most interest .",
    "this is the classical prediction .",
    "however in the quantum theory we will find that the parameter @xmath119 must be related to @xmath120 in some specific way in order to kill exactly the normal components of @xmath71 .",
    "this result ( which we will show shortly in the one - loop quantum fuzzy theory ) is the quantum analogue of the classical continuum statement that equation ( [ cond2 ] ) contains already ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "the total action is then given by @xmath123 ^ 2+if_{abc}d_ad_bd_c\\bigg]+\\frac{3n}{4g^2}tr_n\\phi + \\beta tr_n{\\phi}^2+m^2 tr_n{\\phi}_c^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is essentially the same action considered in @xcite . however this action is different from the action considered in @xcite which is of the form @xmath124",
    "^ 2+\\frac{2i}{3}f_{abc}d_ad_bd_c\\bigg].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first difference is between the cubic terms which come with different coefficients .",
    "the second more crucial difference is the presence of the potential term in our case .",
    "the linear term in @xmath125 is actually a part of the yang - mills action .",
    "the equations of motion derived from the action @xmath126 are @xmath127=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are solved by the fuzzy @xmath46 configurations @xmath128 and also by the diagonal matrices @xmath129 we think of these diagonal matrices ( including the zero matrix ) as describing a single point in accordance with the ikkt model @xcite .",
    "more interestingly is the fact that these equations of motion are also solved by the fuzzy @xmath130 configurations @xmath131 indeed in this case @xmath132=[d_i , f_{ib}]$ ] . for @xmath133",
    "this is equal to @xmath134 because @xmath135 whereas for @xmath136 this is equal to zero because @xmath137 . in above @xmath138 are the generators of @xmath10 in the irreducible representation @xmath139 .",
    "the equations of motion derived from the action @xmath140 are on the other hand given by @xmath141+\\frac{1}{2g^2}f_{abc}f_{bc}+2\\beta\\{\\phi , d_a\\}+m^2\\bigg(2d_{abc}\\{{\\phi}_c , d_b\\}-\\frac{2n+3}{3}{\\phi}_a\\bigg)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the only solutions of these equations of motion are the @xmath46 configurations ( [ cp2nf ] ) .",
    "thus the potential term has eliminated the diagonal matrices ( [ cp2di ] ) as possible solutions .",
    "in fact this classical observation will not hold in the quantum theory for all values of the parameter @xmath120 since there will always be a region in the phase space of the theory where the vacuum solution is not @xmath142 but @xmath143 .",
    "however when we take @xmath120 to be very large positive number then we can see that @xmath142 becomes quantum mechanically more stable .",
    "hence by neglecting the potential term we can not at all speak of the space @xmath46 since it will collapse rather quickly under quantum fluctuations to a single point .",
    "the potential term has also eliminated the fuzzy @xmath130 configurations ( [ cp2s2 ] ) as possible solutions .",
    "in fact even if we set @xmath144 in the above equations of motion the fuzzy @xmath130 configurations ( [ cp2s2 ] ) are not solutions . the other major difference between @xmath140 and @xmath126",
    "is that if we expand around the fuzzy @xmath46 solution @xmath142 by writing @xmath145 and then substitute back in @xmath140 and @xmath126 we find that @xmath126 does not yield in the continuum limit the usual pure gauge theory on @xmath0 .",
    "it contains an extra piece which resembles the chern - simons action ( although it is strictly real ) .",
    "we skip here the corresponding elementary proof ( see the appendix ) .",
    "@xmath140 will yield on the other hand the desired pure gauge theory on @xmath46 in the limit @xmath146 and hence it has the correct continuum limit .",
    "if we do not take the limit @xmath147 then @xmath140 will describe a gauge theory coupled to @xmath87 adjoint scalar fields which are the normal components of @xmath71 .",
    "the only motivation for @xmath126-as far as we can see- is its similarity to the fuzzy @xmath2 action which looks precisely like @xmath126 with the replacement @xmath148 .",
    "this fuzzy sphere action was obtained in string theory in the limit @xmath149 when we have open strings moving in a curved background with an @xmath150 metric in the presence of a neveu - schwarz b - field .",
    "however it is found that perturbation theory with @xmath126 is simpler than perturbation theory with @xmath140 .",
    "more importantly it is found that @xmath126 allows for some new topology change which does not occur with @xmath140 .",
    "in particular the transitions @xmath151 and @xmath152 are possible in the quantum theory of @xmath126 .    using the background field method",
    "we find that the one - loop effective action in the gauge @xmath153 is given by ( see the appendix )    @xmath154&=&{s}_i[d]+\\frac{1}{2}tr_8tr\\log{\\omega}^i_{ab}-tr\\log{\\cal d}_a^2.\\label{for}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath155&=&\\frac{1}{g^2}tr_n\\bigg(-\\frac{1}{4}[d_a , d_b]^2+i{\\alpha}_i f_{abc}d_ad_bd_c\\bigg)+{\\rho}_i tr_n\\phi + { \\beta}_itr_n{\\phi}^2+m_i^2 tr_n{\\phi}_c^2.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath156 the trace @xmath157 corresponds to the left and right actions of operators on matrices whereas @xmath158 is the trace associated with @xmath159dimensional rotations . given a matrix @xmath160 the operator @xmath161 is given by @xmath162 $ ] , for example @xmath163 $ ] .",

    "<S> many gauge theory models on fuzzy complex projective spaces will contain a strong instability in the quantum field theory leading to topology change . </S>",
    "<S> this can be thought of as due to the interaction between spacetime via its noncommutativity and the fields ( matrices ) and it is related to the perturbative uv - ir mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we work out in detail the example of fuzzy @xmath0 and discuss at the level of the phase diagram the quantum transitions between the @xmath1 spaces ( spacetimes ) @xmath0 , @xmath2 and the @xmath3dimensional space consisting of a single point @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the approach of fuzzy physics @xcite @xmath5 to quantum geometry and @xmath6 to non - perturbative field theory insists on the use of finite dimensional matrix algebras with suitable laplacians ( metrics ) to describe the geometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fields will be described by the same matrix algebras or more precisely by the corresponding projective modules @xcite and the action functionals will be given by finite dimensional matrix models similar to the ikkt models @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as it turns out a topology change can occur naturally if we try to unify spactime and fields using this language of finite dimensional matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the picture which emerges from the perturbative and non - perturbative studies of noncommutative gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we found in the one - loop calculation @xcite as well as in numerical simulations @xcite and the large @xmath7 analysis @xcite that the noncommutative gauge model on the fuzzy sphere written in @xcite ( which is obtained in the zero - slope limit of string theory ) and its generalizations undergo first order phase transitions from the `` fuzzy sphere '' phase to a `` matrix '' phase where the fuzzy sphere vacuum collapses under quantum fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix phase is the space consisting of a single point . </S>",
    "<S> this topology change from the two dimensional sphere to a single point and vice versa is intrinsically a quantum mechanical process and it is related to the perturbative uv - ir mixing phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> this result was extended to the case of fuzzy @xmath8 in @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we will go one step further and generalize this result to higher fuzzy complex projective spaces . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we will work out the case of fuzzy @xmath0 in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we find the possibility of first order phase transitions between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , between @xmath0 and a matrix phase and between @xmath2 and a matrix phase . </S>",
    "<S> this richer structure of topology changes is due to the fact that @xmath9 contains also @xmath10 as a subgroup besides the trivial abelian subgroups @xmath11 . as we will explain generalization of our calculation to higher fuzzy complex projective spaces is obvious and straightforward .    </S>",
    "<S> for other approaches to topology change using finite dimensional matrix algebra and fuzzy physics see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this article is organized as follows . </S>"
