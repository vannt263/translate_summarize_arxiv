    "an important class of problems in quantum systems is that of quantum quench , where a parameter in the hamiltonian varies with time , typically attaining constant values at early and late times . starting with some initial state ,",
    "the problem is to determine the nature of the final state .",
    "this problem has recently attracted a lot of attention in several areas of many - body physics , particularly because of progress in cold atom experiments @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . among other things ,",
    "this problem is interesting for two different reasons .",
    "the first relates to the question of thermalization .",
    "does the system evolve into some kind of steady state ?",
    "if so , is the state `` thermal '' in any sense ?",
    "the second question deals with the situation where the quench takes place across a value of the parameter where there is an equilibriium critical point . in this case ,",
    "kibble - zurek type scaling arguments indicate that there are several physical quantities which are _ universal _ and determined by the critical exponents of the critical point .",
    "furthermore for two dimensional theories which are _ suddenly _ quenched to a critical point , powerful techniques of boundary conformal field theory have been used in @xcite to show that ratios of relaxation times of one point functions , as well as the length / time scales associated with the behavior of two point functions of different operators are given in terms of ratios of their conformal dimensions at the critical point , and hence universal .",
    "another related application of this phenomenon is in gravitational physics and cosmology . in this context , this is the phenomenon of particle production in time dependent backgrounds , which is relevant to many physical problems ranging from black hole evaporation to behavior of quantum fluctuations in an expanding universe .",
    "there are very few theoretical tools available to study such systems when they are strongly coupled . in this note",
    "we will explore the use of ads / cft correspondence @xcite - @xcite to this problem .",
    "ads / cft techniques have been in fact used in the past to study quantum quench , though not at critical points . in ads",
    "/ cft the boundary values of bulk fields become coupling constants , so that this problem becomes that of determining a time dependent background with specified initial and boundary conditions . as is usual , a _",
    "problem in the boundary theory becomes a classical problem in general relativity .",
    "one class of problems involve a vacuum initial state ( in the bulk this is pure @xmath11 in the distant past ) and a change of the boundary value of some field ( e.g. the dilaton or the boundary metric ) over some finite time interval , in a regime where supergravity is always valid . in the boundary field theory",
    "this corresponds to turning on a time dependent source for the dual operator . under suitable conditions , this leads to black hole formation in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the correlators at future time would then be thermal with a temperature characterized by the hawking temperature .",
    "the time scale after which this happens depends on the nature of the correlators , but turns out to be always smaller than what one would expect from a conformally invariant system evolving to a thermal state .",
    "thus , in this case thermalization of the field theory is signalled by black hole formation .",
    "another class of problems involve a similar setup , but a suitable variation of the coupling which prevents black hole formation in the supergravity regime .",
    "the coupling , however , becomes _ weak _ at some time and the bulk string frame curvature grows large , leading to a breakdown of the supergravity approximation - thus mimicking a space - like singularity @xcite . for the case of a slow variation of the coupling it turns out that the gauge theory remains well defined and",
    "may be used to show that a smooth passage through this region of small coupling is possible without formation of a large black hole .",
    "related scenarios appear in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many interesting phenomena in gauge - gravity duality , in particular phase transitions , can be explored consistently in a _",
    "probe approximation_. in this approximation , a certain set of bulk fields can be treated separately and independently of bulk gravity .",
    "one set of examples are probe branes in a background @xmath12 .",
    "this introduces hypermultiplets which in general live on a defect in the original field theory .",
    "when the number of such branes , @xmath13 is much smaller than the number of flux units which produce the background geometry , @xmath14 , the dynamics of these branes do not backreact on the bulk metric which remains @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamics is then described by a dbi action in a fixed background - the fields in this action are then bulk probe fields . if the boundary value of such a probe field is time dependent in a fashion similar to above , black hole formation in the bulk is invisible in the probe approximation .",
    "however , rather remarkably , thermalization of the hypermultiplet sector is still visible .",
    "this manifests itself by the formation of an apparent horizon ( which evolve into an event horizon in some situations ) in the induced metric on the brane worldvolume @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the brane feel this induced metric and their correlators have thermal properties .",
    "none of the above works study quench dynamics near a phase transition . in this paper",
    "we take the first step towards doing that , in a simple model which displays an equilibrium critical point in a probe limit @xcite .",
    "the model involves a neutral scalar field whose mass lies in the range @xmath15 in the background of a charged @xmath2 black brane .",
    "the overall coupling is chosen to be large so that the scalar can be treated as a probe . for a given brane background (",
    "i.e. for a given temperature and charge density in the dual field theory ) , and for a vanishing non - normalizable mode of the field ( corresponding to a vanishing source of the dual operator ) there is always a critical mass @xmath3 below which the trivial solution is unstable . in this regime",
    "the stable solution is nontrivial , signifying a nonzero expectation for the dual operator in the dual theory .",
    "@xmath16 with a vanishing source is then a critical point , which happens to have standard mean field exponents .",
    "this setup is in fact quite similar to models of holographic superconductors and fermi surfaces @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , here the scalar field is neutral so that the dynamics of the gauge field is frozen .",
    "this model has been argued to model phase transitions in antiferromagnets . as is well known , in this mass range there are two inequivalent quantizations .",
    "our analysis is restricted to the conventional quantization of the bulk scalar , where the mode which vanishes slower at the boundary is treated as the source in the boundary theory .",
    "a similar analysis can be easily performed for the alternative quantization .",
    "we will study the time evolution of the order parameter starting from adiabatic initial conditions in the ordered phase .",
    "the passage through the critical point is done in two ways - ( i ) by keeping the bulk mass at its critical value and changing the leading term of the near - boundary expansion of the bulk field and ( ii ) by changing a bulk mass parameter with a vanishing leading term .",
    "the field theory meaning of ( i ) is clear - this corresponds to turning on a source dual to the bulk field : the critical point appears when the source vanishes and the mass is at its critical value .",
    "the meaning of ( ii ) is less direct - changing a bulk mass means changing the anomalous dimension of the corresponding operator in the field theory . as discussed in @xcite , one way to do this",
    "is in fact coupling this scalar field to another field and changing the source for this other field .",
    "away from the critical point , adiabaticity holds for a sufficiently low rate of change .",
    "we will show that the adiabatic corrections are proportional to _ linear _ time derivatives , even though the equations of motion involve only second order time derivatives .",
    "this is a well - known phenomenon and happens because of dissipation implied by the presence of a horizon . in the bulk",
    ", we need to impose regularity conditions at the horizon , which is easily done using ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinate @xcite @xmath17 as time .",
    "@xmath17 coincides with the usual time coordinate @xmath18 on the boundary and @xmath19 , though @xmath20 .",
    "the bulk equations now involve first order derivatives @xmath21 .",
    "as expected , adiabaticity fails as one approaches the critical point at a time which we choose to be @xmath22 .",
    "the appearance of a first order time derivative is related to the fact that the dynamical critical exponent of similar models turn out to be @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "when adiabaticity fails , the system enters a scaling regime .",
    "a useful way to understand the dynamics is to decompose the bulk field in terms of eigenstates of the radial operator which appears in the linearized problem around the equilibrium solution . for any nonzero temperature of the background black brane",
    ", this operator has a zero mode which is regular at the horizon exactly at the critical point .",
    "we will show that in the critical region , the dynamics for small @xmath24 is dominated by that of this zero mode .",
    "the other modes remain adiabatic .",
    "the scaling properties can be then understood in terms of a landau - ginsburg type dynamics of the zero mode with a _ linear _ time derivative .",
    "the order parameter remains nonzero even when the instantaneous value of the coupling reaches the equilibrium critical value and first drops to zero at a time @xmath25 where @xmath24 denotes the rate of change of the coupling in the critical region .",
    "the departure of the value of the order parameter from the instantaneous equilibrium value also scales as @xmath26 .",
    "the exponents @xmath27 and @xmath28 are essentially determined by the static critical exponents .    beyond the critical region , however ,",
    "the other modes become important .",
    "in fact , at very late times the bulk equation may be approximated by its linearized form , so that the solutions are nothing but the usual quasinormal modes around the background black hole . as usual , the imaginary part of the lowest quasinormal mode frequency",
    "then determine the decay of late time behavior .",
    "we also present preliminary results of a numerical solution of the time dependent equations for the bulk field and extract the time dependence of the order parameter .",
    "the results are consistent with the above picture .",
    "our numerical results are not yet accurate enough to verify the scaling behavior .",
    "however this should be possible with further work .",
    "in section 2 we discuss spatially homogeneous classical quench in a landau - ginsburg type model as a prelude . in section 3",
    "we review the main faetures of the equilibrium phase transition . in section 4",
    "we discuss the failure of adiabaticity in quantum quench across this transition .",
    "we then show that in the critical region the dynamics for an initially slow quench is dominated by that of the zero mode , and discuss its relationship of the dynamics to the landau - ginsburg model of section 2 .",
    "in section 5 we present the results of a numerical solution of the bulk equation of motion and verify the expectations in the previous section .",
    "section 6 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "the three appendices provide details of derivation of the some of the results contained in the main text .",
    "as a prelude to the main discussion , in this section we will study classical spatially homogeneous quench in a landau - ginsburg model , which is described by the equation , + m^2(t)+^2 -1+j(t)=0 [ 22 - 2 ] as discussed above , holography converts the problem of a _ quantum _ quench to a problem of _ classical _ quench in one more dimension - which is the motivation behind studying ( [ 22 - 2 ] ) . in a later section",
    "we will show that this simple model describes some of the essential features of the dynamics in the critical region of the holographic phase transition which is the main subject of this paper .",
    "note that we do not have any noise term ( which is what is needed for many other applications ) .",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath10 are time independent , this model has a critical point at @xmath29 .",
    "here we have kept generic @xmath27 and @xmath28 for convenience of later discussion . in most conservative models ,",
    "i.e. where energy is conserved , @xmath30 .",
    "however as we will see @xmath31 is more appropriate for the holographic transition which we will discuss . in the following",
    "we will therefore use this value .",
    "we will also concentrate on the @xmath32 case , i.e. a quartic interaction .",
    "let us first discuss the case where @xmath6 is time varying , but a @xmath0 which is independent of time and positive .",
    "for a time independent @xmath10 we have , m^2 + ^3+j=0 denote the solution of this static equation by @xmath33 .",
    "we then introduce a @xmath6 which is slowly varying with time .",

    "if the values of @xmath201 were discrete , the @xmath202 mode would clearly dominate the dynamics for small @xmath24 .",
    "however , @xmath201 is a continuous parameter starting from zero - this naively indicates that the perturbation expansion in @xmath193 could break down . whether this happens or not depends on the behavior of the numerator on the right hand side of ( [ scalingeqn ] ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that all the terms like @xmath203 as @xmath204 , rendering the perturbation expandion in @xmath205 well defined .",
    "this is shown in appendix ( [ kscaling ] ) .",
    "thus , in the critical region the solution @xmath206 is dominated by the zero mode piece proportional to @xmath207 . in terms of the original variables , we have finally @xmath208 since the equation for @xmath195 is identical to the equation for the quantity @xmath51 in the toy model ( [ 22 - 2 ] ) , we are led to scaling relations identical to the @xmath179 dimensional model .",
    "the one point function of the dual operator is given by ( u ) ~lim_0 [ ^1-_+ _ s ( , u ) ] therefore , the time dependence of @xmath123 is governed by the same scaling behavior .",

    "this means that away from the critical point , all the modes are important .",
    "another way to quench across the critical point is to consider a time dependent @xmath0 with no source , keeping the background geometry fixed .",
    "the mass function is taken to asymptote to some constant value of @xmath4 at early times and then rise to a constant value @xmath211 at late times , e.g. m^2(u ) = m_c^2+(m_c^2-m_1 ^ 2)(v u ) [ 2 - 1 ] note that we have a mass which depends on the ef coordinate @xmath17 rather than the time coordinate @xmath18 .",
    "the motivation for this is as follows .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we may consider the bulk mass term as arising from a coupling of the scalar field with some other field .",
    "this latter field acquires an expectation value in response to a source which leads to a mass of our field @xmath51 . in this scenario ,",
    "a time dependent source of the second field would lead , by causality , to an effective mass - squared which has the form @xmath212 , where the ellipsis denote terms which involve @xmath17 derivatives of @xmath7 .",
    "the function @xmath213 vanishes at the boundary and is regular at the horizon . to leading order",
    "we therefore get an equation like ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) with the potential @xmath214 modified by replacing @xmath215 .",
    "the analysis in the previous sections can be now easily repeated for this problem .",
    "below we outline the main steps and results .",
    "let us consider the case of a time dependent mass which asymptotes to a sufficiently negative value , @xmath216 . if the mass remained constant at @xmath216 there is a nonzero static solution @xmath217 .",
    "now once we make the the mass time dependent we solve ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) adiabatically in @xmath218 . for a mass which is _ slowly varying _",
    "one expects that the time dependent solution of ( [ 1 - 6 ] ) may be constructed around an adiabatic solution , ( , u;m(u ) ) = _ 0 ( , m(u ) ) + ^2  _ 1(,u ) + .",
    "[ 1 - 15 ] @xmath219 is the static solution obtained by ignoring the time dependence of the mass completely . here",
    "@xmath34 is an adiabaticity parameter which keeps track of the adiabatic expansion .",

    "@xmath222 the first term defines the scaling relation .",
    "the expectation value of the scalar field in the scaling regime has the following properties , = < ( t v^ ) > v^",
    "in this section we will solve the equations ( [ 1 - 10 ] ) numerically , although our analysis is quite preliminary .",
    "mainly we would like to understand how the system behaves away from the regime of slowly varying quench .",
    "it is generally hard to solve pde s numerically .",
    "however we will use the convenient method of lines . in this method",
    "the pde is at first discretized only in the @xmath96 direction .",
    "this gives rise to a set of odes .",
    "this set of odes is then treated in a ode solver .",
    "we fix the boundary condition at the two ends , at the boundary and at the horizon .",
    "we use a regularity boundary condition at the horizon and appropriate standard quantization condition at infinity .",
    "the initial radial profile of the scalar field and its derivative are given at @xmath22 .",
    "in most cases the initial value scalar profile would be a solution with @xmath223 . hence @xmath224 .",
    "then we will change @xmath0 to some other value higher than the critical mass .",
    "the first point to note is that at late times , i.e. out of the critical region , any finite energy excitation is gradually sucked up by the black hole .",
    "in fact at late times , the equation can be approximately linearized and the solution in a black hole background can be expressed as a sum of quasi normal modes .",
    "hence , the quasi normal frequency with smallest imaginary part determines the late time decay of the scalar field in a black hole geometry @xcite . we find a similar decaying behavior even in the full non - linear theory ( fig [ dasbasu ] ) .",
    "note that the scalar field falls in the black hole as expected .",
    "a time dependent @xmath73 changes the scalar field profile near the boundary . as the potential vanishes near the black hole horizon ,",
    "changing the value of @xmath73 does not have an immediate effect .",
    "hence a time dependent @xmath73 creates disturbances near the boundary .",
    "the disturbances then propagate towards horizon along a light cone .",
    "in this work we have taken a first step in using ads / cft methods to study quantum quench across holographic critical points .",
    "the particular critical point we study is a mean field transition at any finite temperature , and it is not surprising that the critical behavior can be obtained by a landau - ginsburg type model of an appropriate mode . it may appear surprising that the dynamics involves a first order time derivative , even though the underlying theory is lorentz invariant . as discussed above , this is a feature of non - zero temperature which manifests itself as a dissipative horizon in the bulk .",
    "however , similar techniques can be used to study other interesting non - mean field theory transitions .",
    "in particular , the zero temperature limit of the transition which we study is of berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "other examples of such non - trivial transitions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the situation is more subtle in this case : it would be worthwhile to study quench in these systems",
    ". it would be also interesting to study dynamics of holographic transitions associated with black branes whose ir geometry is of lifshitz type @xcite .    as discussed above , ads / cft maps quantum quench in a strongly coupled theory to a classical quench in one higher dimension .",
    "the dynamics is completely deterministic , as opposed to e.g. langevin dynamics - the effect of a non - zero temperature being accounted by the presence of a black brane in the bulk .",
    "such systems have also been studied in the past @xcite . in these studies , however the interesting questions are rather different .",
    "they involve , for example , long time behavior of fluctuations and correlation functions when averaged over initial conditions .",
    "these questions can be addressed in our framework as well - they would correspond to @xmath225 corrections of the dual field theory and are left to future work .",
    "a related direction is the study of entanglement entropy during a quench which has been studied holographically in other contexts in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to extend our considerations to inhomogeneous quench . in this case",
    "one interesting question relates to defect formation as one crosses the phase transition .",
    "some aspects of this question has been studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see if expected scaling properties continue to hold , and if there is any analytical insight in terms of the eigenmodes of the radial operator .",
    "in this section we will study quantum quench in a simple _ relativistic _ landau - ginsburg model .",
    "the relevant lagranian is = - ^2 + m^2(t ) + ^4 + j(t ) [ 22 - 1 ] in our language this is a system with @xmath226 quench in a holographic model without any black hole horizon , e.g. a quench in global @xmath11 , is expected to obey eqn ( 22 - 1 ) as an effective description .",
    "this is suggested by the fact that in this latter situation the lowest order adiabatic correction is proportional to the second derivative of the source , as is consistent with lack of dissipation ( see e.g. the last reference in @xcite .",
    "this kind of model also appears in dynamics of phase transitions in cosmology @xcite a thorough discussion on those issues is left to the future .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ 22 - 1 ] ) leads to the equation of motion + m^2(t)+^3+j(t)=0 [ 22 - 2b ] when @xmath0 and @xmath10 are time independent , this model has a critical point at @xmath29 .",
    "we study quench by seting @xmath227 and considering a time dependent @xmath228 . for small",
    "@xmath24 , breakdown of adiabaticity occurs when , tv^ ~1 the scaling solution in the critical regime is given by , ( t)= v^ ( t v^ ) .",
    "as discussed in the main text this scaling relation fixes @xmath229 and zero crossing time @xmath230 .",
    "if we continue the quench we may ask how much excess energy ( or the equivalently the amplitude of oscillation ) remains in the system at late times . if the adiabatic approximation were valid , the excess energy would be suppressed exponentially .",
    "however , here the system goes through a critical point where adiabaticity is broken and at late times the energy turns out to scale as a power of @xmath24 .",
    "the purpose of the next two appendices is to justify the perturbation expansion in @xmath231 used to derive the critical region scaling in section 4.2 .",
