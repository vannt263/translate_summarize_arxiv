    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is an extension of the standard model ( sm ) that assigns to each sm field a superpartner field with a spin differing by half a unit .",
    "susy provides elegant solutions to several open issues of the sm , such as the hierarchy problem , the nature of dark matter  @xcite , and the grand unification .",
    "susy is one of the most relevant scenarios of new physics probed at the cern large hadron collider  @xcite , yet no signs of susy have been observed so far . in view of these null results in _ conventional _ susy searches , it becomes mandatory to fully explore _",
    "non - standard _ susy scenarios involving @xmath0-parity violation ( rpv )  @xcite and/or quasi - stable particles .",
    "@xmath0  parity is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the baryon ( lepton ) number and @xmath6 the spin , respectively .",
    "hence all standard model particles have @xmath7 , whereas @xmath8 for all susy particles .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the conservation of @xmath0  parity is an _ ad - hoc _ assumption .",
    "the only strict limitation comes from the proton lifetime : non - conservation of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 leads to a rapid proton decay .",
    "@xmath0-parity conservation has serious consequences in susy phenomenology in colliders : the susy particles are produced in pairs and , most importantly , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is absolutely stable and weakly interacting , thus providing the characteristic high transverse missing momentum ( ) in susy events at colliders . here",
    "we highlight two rpv models : the bilinear rpv ( brpv ) and the @xmath1-from-@xmath2 supersymmetric standard model ( ) , which as we shall see both reproduce correctly the neutrino physics observations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sc : brpv ] is dedicated to brpv susy models : their connection with neutrino physics is explained in section  [ sc : brpv - nu ] , its phenomenology at the lhc is provided in section  [ sc : brpv - pheno ] , while section  [ sc : brpv - atlas ] presents the current constraints from the atlas experiment .",
    "the @xmath1-from-@xmath2 supersymmetric standard model is discussed in section  [ sc : munussm ] .",
    "after a brief review of the theoretical motivation for , descriptions of its possible signatures at the lhc based on multileptons and displaced vertices follow in section  [ sc : munussm - lhc ] .",
    "sections  [ sc : munussm - higgs ] and  [ sc : munussm - wz ] focus on higgs decays and unusual @xmath9/@xmath10 boson decays in the context of @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "aspects of rpv susy linked to dark matter are discussed in section  [ sc : dm ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary and an outlook in section  [ sc : summary ] .",
    "@xmath0-parity conservation ( rpc ) has several consequences such as the stability of the lsp , which is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) and consequently a candidate for dark matter ( dm )  @xcite .",
    "being a wimp , once produced at the lhc , it will escape detection , resulting in large missing transverse momentum , . providing a dm candidate",
    "is one of the strongest arguments in favour of rpc susy , nonetheless rpv models _ do _ exist that can explain dm through , for instance , very light gravitinos  @xcite , axions  @xcite or axinos  @xcite .",
    "there is no fundamental reason for @xmath0  parity to be conserved thus lepton and baryon number violating renormalisable terms may appear in the supersymmetric potential in the following way : @xmath12    where the couplings @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16 yukawa matrices @xmath17 being flavour indexes , @xmath18 are parameters with units of mass and @xmath19 refer to supermultiplets .",
    "the first three types of terms lead to lepton number violation , while the baryon number is violated by the fourth one .",
    "as long as the breaking of @xmath0  parity is spontaneous , only bilinear terms arise in the effective theory below the rpv scale , thus rendering bilinear @xmath0-parity violation a theoretically attractive scenario .",
    "moreover , the bilinear model provides a theoretically self - consistent scheme in the sense that trilinear rpv implies , by renormalisation group effects , that also bilinear rpv is present , but not conversely  @xcite .    in other words ,",
    "the simplest way to break @xmath0  parity is to add bilinear terms to the mssm potential . besides that",
    ", additional bilinear soft susy breaking terms are introduced , which include small vacuum expectation values for the sneutrinos .",
    "the relevant superpotential @xmath10 and the soft supersymmetry breaking terms @xmath20 , which include bilinear @xmath0-parity violation , would then be  @xcite @xmath21    where the @xmath22 have units of mass .",
    "in fact , if susy was not broken , the bilinear terms could be rotated away and be converted into trilinear terms , however the presence of the soft susy breaking terms @xmath23 gives brpv a physical meaning  @xcite .",
    "there are nine new parameters introduced in this model : @xmath18 , @xmath22 and @xmath24 , the latter being the sneutrino vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "however , after electroweak symmetry breaking and taking into account constraints from neutrino experiment results , only one free parameter remains in the model , which is set to be of the same order as the others .",
    "sneutrino vevs introduce a mixing between neutrinos and neutralinos , leading to a see - saw mechanism that gives mass to one neutrino mass scale at tree level .",
    "the second neutrino mass scale is induced by loop effects  @xcite .",
    "the same vevs are also involved in the decay of the lsp , which in this case is the lightest neutralino .",
    "this implies a relation between neutrino physics and some features of the lsp modes .",
    "an example of such a connection is given by the relation  @xcite @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and the `` alignment '' parameters @xmath27 are defined as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the vev of @xmath30 .",
    "this relation between rpv and neutrino physics allows setting bounds on brpv parameters from results of neutrino experiment and astrophysical data  @xcite . in the opposite direction , a possible positive signal observed in colliders may lead to the determination of some of the brpv phenomenological properties , which in turn can constrain neutrino - physics parameters  @xcite .      in the specific bilinear @xmath0-parity violating model discussed here , the lsp is the lightest neutralino , @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the brpv terms are embedded in the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model , which imposes some restrictions which reduce the large number of parameters of the mssm .",
    "the number of parameters in msugra is reduced to five , namely @xmath32 , the scalar mass ; @xmath33 , the gaugino mass ; @xmath34 , the trilinear scalar coupling ; @xmath35 , the ratio of the higgs vevs ; and @xmath36 , the sign of the higgsino mass parameter .",
    "the six brpv parameters for each msugra point are determined by the ` spheno `  @xcite spectrum calculator . `",
    "spheno ` uses as input the msugra parameters and the neutrino physics constraints , and delivers as output the brpv parameters ( together with the mass spectra and the decay modes ) compatible with these constraints .",
    "once those quantities are calculated for a given set of brpv parameters within an msugra benchmark point , they can subsequently passed to an event generator and produce collision events at the lhc .",
    "it is stressed that the sparticle spectrum for brpv - msugra is within theoretical uncertainties the same as in rpc msugra ; it is the lsp decay modes and its lifetime that depend on the brpv parameters .",
    "typical  decay modes are shown in fig .",

    "the neutralino decays are dominated by leptonic @xmath40 or @xmath41 channels , making lepton - based searches ideal for constraining this model .",
    "the decay to a muon and a hadronically - decaying @xmath10 has been studied in detail and it has been shown that it may lead to the measurement of the  mass through the reconstruction of the @xmath42 peak in the @xmath43 invariant mass  @xcite . furthermore the fact that in the low-@xmath33 high-@xmath32 region the  is slightly long lived , as evident from fig .",

    "so far we have discussed the brpv in the context of supergravity models .",
    "if the brpv terms are introduced to anomaly - mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) instead , the  lsp decay modes do not change , whereas the wino - like neutralino ( as opposed to the bino - like in msugra ) is characterised by stronger interactions , hence it is easier to be produced at lhc .",

    "the common feature of brpv phenomenology is the presence of delayed decays leading to interesting signatures at the lhc .      as mentioned above , thanks to the abundant neutrino production from the lsp decay , brpv events at the lhc are expected to feature relatively ( when compared to standard model processes ) high missing transverse momentum .",
    "high lepton/@xmath41 multiplicity is also expected from the lsp decays and from upstream lepton production in the susy cascade decay , if strong production is considered .",
    "both features are exploited when looking for a signal of the brpv - msugra model , as demonstrated in ref .",

    "[ fg : decay ] , hence muon channels yield stronger limits than their electron counterparts . a slight loss of sensitivity in the high-@xmath32 low-@xmath33 region was observed due to the large lsp lifetime , which causes signal muons to be rejected by the cosmic - muon veto , i.e.  the cut on muons with high impact parameter .",
    "aforesaid limits were extended further by an analysis with @xmath54 based on events with high jet multiplicity ( at least seven jets ) , large  and exactly one lepton ( muon or electron )  @xcite .",

    "subsequently upper limits have been set on the size of the @xmath0-parity violating coupling in the range of @xmath135 to @xmath136 .",
    "these limits turn out to be more stringent than those coming from contributions to neutrino masses or from the baryon asymmetry in the early universe .",
    "combining them with lower limits from big - bang nucleosynthesis constraints on the nlsp lifetime allows narrowing down the available parameter space for gravitino dm with brpv .",
    "recent analyses of combined spectra of multiple galaxy clusters and the andromeda galaxy from the xmm - newton telescope , have revealed a tentative line with the central energy of 3.5  kev  @xcite . first and foremost , any long lived particle that produces enough number of photons should be a good candidate as a source of x - rays . among the various theoretical scenarios attempting to explain it ,",
    "rpv susy with an lsp decaying to photon and a neutrino is a possibility . in bilinear rpv",
    "it was found that a warm - dark - matter axino with a mass of @xmath137 can have the proper lifetime and relic density to account for the observed x - ray emission line through its decay @xmath138  @xcite .",
    "alternatively the line may be due to annihilating dm with @xmath139 .",
    "apart from the axino , other possible candidates include a gravitino , a bino , or a hidden sector photino as decaying dm leading to such a signal studied in the context of other - than - bilinear rpv susy scenarios  @xcite .",
    "such gravitino dm is also proposed in the context of  with profound prospects for detecting @xmath110 rays from their decay  @xcite . in studies on the prospects of the fermi - lat telescope to detect such monochromatic lines in five years of observations of the most massive nearby extragalactic objects",
    ", it was found that a gravitino with a mass range of @xmath140 , and with a lifetime range of about @xmath141  s should be detectable with a signal - to - noise ratio larger than three  @xcite . after confronting the actual @xmath110-ray flux data , limits on the model parameters",
    "have been set  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that gravitino masses larger than about 4  are already excluded in the  by fermi - lat data of the galactic halo  @xcite . the constraints on @xmath142 lifetime versus mass obtained by the 5-year fermi - lat and other @xmath110-ray observations , as a consequence of the limits on line emission , are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fg : fermi ] .",
    "if the photino - neutrino mixing parameter @xmath143 from the @xmath144 neutralino mixing matrix is between @xmath145 and @xmath146 , the correct neutrino masses are reproduced in .",
    "values of the gravitino mass larger than 5  , are disfavoured , or lifetimes smaller than @xmath147 , are excluded at 95% cl as dm candidates .",
    "@xmath0-parity breaking couplings can be sufficiently large to lead to interesting expectations for collider phenomenology .",
    "the neutralino nlsp , depending on the rpv model considered , may decay into  @xcite @xmath148    such decays may be probed at the lhc via inclusive channels characterised by leptons , many jets , large  and/or photons or exclusive channels involving the reconstruction of a @xmath9 or a @xmath149 from its decay products .",
    "the cases where the nlsp is long - lived yet with a decay length comparable to the dimensions of an lhc experiment are particularly interesting , as they give rise to displaced tracks / leptons and non - pointing photons .",
    "the possibility to measure the neutralino decay length provides an extra handle to constrain the underlying susy model . nevertheless determining whether @xmath0  parity is conserved or broken may not be trivial since the dm particles themselves , whether absolutely stable or quasi - stable , can not be detected directly in collider experiments . to this effect ,",
    "an interplay between collider and astroparticle physics is necessary to pin down the dark matter properties and the related theoretical - model parameters .",
    "the hitherto null results of searches for supersymmetry in conventional channels calls for a more systematic and thorough consideration of non - standard susy theoretical scenarios and experimental techniques . to this effect ,",
    "scenarios involving violations of @xmath0  parity and/or ( meta)stable particles arise as interesting alternatives .",
    "@xmath0-parity violating supersymmetry may reproduce correctly the measured neutrino physics parameters .",
    "moreover its enriched mass spectrum and @xmath0-parity breaking decays can lead to novel signals at colliders , among which very few possibilities have been explored so far . in particular , searches for displaced objects at the lhc offer an attractive possibility as well as the prompt multilepton analyses .",
    "the former suffer from less background sources from sm processes when compared to prompt - object searches .",
    "more sophisticated searches are expected by atlas , cms and lhcb in the near future during lhc run  ii , where energies of @xmath150 will be probed .",

    "<S> @xmath0-parity violating supersymmetric models ( rpv susy ) are becoming increasingly more appealing than its @xmath0-parity conserving counterpart in view of the hitherto non - observation of susy signals at the lhc . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> rpv scenarios where neutrino masses are naturally generated are discussed , namely rpv through bilinear terms ( brpv ) and the `` @xmath1 from @xmath2 '' supersymmetric standard model ( ) . the latter is characterised by a rich higgs sector that easily accommodates a 125-  higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of such models at the lhc is reviewed , giving emphasis on final states with displaced objects , and relevant results obtained by lhc experiments are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the implications for dark matter for these theoretical proposals is also addressed . </S>"
