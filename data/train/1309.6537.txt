    "young stellar objects ( ysos ) are known to be strong emitters of x - rays with typical photon energies @xmath0 kev ( preibisch et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these x - rays irradiate the accretion disks of ysos where they are responsible for ionizing the inner disk at depths beyond the range of far ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons ( glassgold , najita & igea 1997 ) . using a monte carlo code , igea and glassgold ( 1999 ;",
    "ig99 ) studied the propagation of the x - rays in the accretion disks around ysos ( henceforth protoplanetary disks ) . including both absorption and scattering",
    ", they showed that scattering allows hard x - rays to penetrate disks to depths as far down as vertical columns of @xmath1 , or about 70 g @xmath2 .",
    "this depth extends well below the warm inner atmospheres of protoplanetary disks that are observable at near and mid infrared wavelengths .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , there have been no confirming calculations of the results of ig99 in the intervening years .",
    "we do this here using up to date methods embodied in the mocassin code ( ercolano et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 , 2008a ; www.3d-mocassin.net ) .",
    "ercolano et al .",
    "( 2008b , 2009 ) and ercolano & owen ( 2010 ) have applied this code to a study of diagnostics for protoplanetary disk atmospheres .",
    "mohanty , ercolano & turner ( 2013 ) have used the mocassin x - ray ionization rates in their analysis of midplane ionization of protoplanetary disks .",
    "in addition to verifying and clarifying the results in ig99 , we extend the scope of this work by studying the dependence on the elemental abundances in protoplanetary disks and by investigating realistic x - ray spectra based on observations of ysos",
    ". we also present our results online in useful form .",
    "our initial objective is to compare results obtained by ig99 with those from moccasin .",
    "it is important to recognize that detailed comparisons are not simple because the two procedures are very different .",
    "mocassin is a broad based radiative transfer program that includes x - rays , whereas the ig99 calculation was a one - time specific calculation .",
    "the underlying physics is treated differently in the two programs and to make matters more difficult , the full electronic version of the ig99 code has been lost .",
    "we performed the ionization rate calculation using a modified version of the 3d radiative transfer and photoionization code mocassin ( ercolano et al 2003 , 2005 , 2008a ) .",
    "the code uses a monte carlo photon packet approach to the transfer of radiation ( lucy et al 1999 ) , allowing the treatment of both the direct stellar radiation as well as the diffuse fields and the transfer through a mixture of gas and dust .",
    "mocassin includes all the relevant x - ray photoionization and related processes , as described by ercolano et al ( 2008a ) .",
    "this code differs from the treatment in ig99 by allowing a full treatment of compton scattering and secondary ionization by suprathermal electrons that are produced by inner shell ionization of abundant metals . .",
    "it also uses a more sophisticated monte carlo estimator for the radiation field .",
    "the treatment of physical processes by ig99 is significantly simpler .",
    "the direct absorption by x - rays is expressed with an analytic approximation to the cosmic average cross section for both solar and depleted abundances ( defined in table 1 ) .",
    "compton scattering and ionization are also included .",
    "the secondary electrons that arise from x - ray absorption and the auger effect actually generate the bulk of the ionization , but they are not followed in detail .",
    "instead the ionization is computed using the semi - empirical energy to make an ion - pair , which is close to 36ev ( dalgarno et al .",
    "2009 ) for a fully neutral gas , which is the case assumed in the models .",
    "in order to compare our calculations with those of ig99 for the same or at least very similar conditions , we ran several calculations for monochromatic and thermal spectra using the ig99 depleted abundances ( table 1 ) .",
    "we have found that the ig99 analytic approximation for the absorption cross - section agrees very well with the mocassin cross - section for the same abundances .",
    "however , ig99 adopted a low energy cut - off of 1kev in their work , so that the low - energy absorption is different in the two calculations .",
    "table 1 lists the abundances used in this work .",
    "the first column gives the rather extreme abundances used by ig99 , where most of the heavy elements are completely removed except for obviously highly volatile elements .",
    "the scenario behind this choice is that the protoplanetary grains have agglomerated and settled to the midplane .",
    "the third column lists the well determined interstellar abundances for diffuse interstellar clouds obtained from uv absorption line spectroscopy ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",

    "we take a different approach here by weighting the input photon packets so that all ranges in the input spectrum are appropriately sampled .",
    "this is important to ensure the accuracy of the ionization rates at large columns in the disc where only the most energetic photons in the high - frequency tail of the input spectrum can penetrate .",
    "+ we follow ig99 and assume a ring source of radius 5@xmath33 placed at a height of 5@xmath33 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of a given source is therefore scaled by a factor of two , to account for two rings placed symmetrically above and below the disc midplane .",
    "thus the luminosities quoted in the text and tables are the total for both ring sources .",
    "we note that the ionization rates do not depend strongly on the exact choice of the ring radius for values varying between 2 and 10 @xmath33 , as already demonstrated by ig99 .",

    "we note here however , that , as demonstrated in ig99 , the ionization rates are not sensitive to the exact choice of the surface density distribution ( see figure 5 in ig99 ) , and depend mainly on vertical column density .",
    "in this section we first make some comparisons between the present calculations of ionization rates and those in ig99 .",

    "the black mocassin points are generally in good agreement with the red curves from ig99 .",

    "figure 3 , we have also calculated the ionization rates for thermal spectra with @xmath41 3 , 5 and 8kev at three radii , @xmath42 1 , 5 and 10au . in figure 2 , the calculations are color coded as black ( 3 kev ) , red ( 5 kev ) and green ( 8 kev ) .",
    "the 10 au curve has been shifted down by 1 dex for purposes of clarity .",

    "different energies do not differ very much , but the ig99 5kev curve is significantly higher than the new calculations at moderately high densities .",
    "part of the differences can be ascribed to the green function approach employed by ig99 . as already noted by ig99",
    ", their use of equally spaced @xmath43 functions leads to an undersampling in the 1 - 2 kev region when the thermal average is calculated .",
    "however , taking into account the limitations and uncertainties in making such comparisons , the agreement between ig99 and the present calculations is quite good .",
    "figure 2 confirms the conclusion of ig99 that the ionization rate depends only weakly on the x - ray temperature and mainly on the x - ray flux , i.e. , on the luminosity and the radius .    ,",

    "we refer to this average spectrum as coup msm ( for mean solar mass ) .",
    "the low and high x - ray temperature components have , respectively , 1/3 and 2/3 of the total luminosity of @xmath44 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 3 for solar abundances ( black curves ) and ism depleted abundances ( red curves ) . at small and moderately large column densities , @xmath45 , there is a fairly strong dependence on abundance . recalling the discussion in sec .  2 on grain growth and settling ,",
    "this may also be considered as a dependence on grain size .",
    "solar abundances might then apply to _ small _ grains where the heavy elements are fully exposed to the x - rays independent of their partitioning between gas and grain .",
    "the depleted abundances would correspond to the situation where the depleted elements are incorporated into grains that grow and settle out close to the midplane .",
    "this is probably the case for protoplanetary disk atmospheres exposed to stellar x - rays .",
    "for very large column densities the ionization rates are almost independent of the abundances , as might be expected for the situation where the main interaction of the x - rays is thomson / compton scattering and ionization of h and he .",
    "figure 3 confirms again that the thomson cross section determines the range of the x - rays , in this @xmath46 .",
    "this is expected due to the significant hardening of the radiation field at these columns .",
    "thomson scattering begins to dominate over absorption for energies greater than @xmath05kev , but photons of these energies are the only ones that can penetrate so deep . some of the curves in figure 3 seem to drop precipitously due to the small number of surviving photons at the largest columns . at these maximum depths ,",

    "the results are roughly similar to figure 3 , the non - flaring case of coup results for solar mass ysos . due to the high @xmath48 and high @xmath49 , the results are even more sensitive to abundances , and the dominance of compton / thomson scattering is not manifest until very large vertical columns .    , and",

    "2008 ) against those for a two - temperature representation of the average spectrum of the coup solar - mass sample ( wolk et al .",
    "2005 ) for the orion nebula custer .",
    "this comparison is illustrated in figure 5 at 1au , 5au and 10au using depleted abundances .",
    "the luminosities were normalised to @xmath50 ionising annulus ( i.e. , a total luminosity of @xmath51 ) .",
    "the harder flare spectrum produces higher ionisation rates at larger columns .",
    "the radiative transfer is dominated by thompson / compton scattering in this case , as is clearly visible in the bump in the ionisation rate curves at high column density .",

    "the differences are due to the fact that the harder photons require a larger column before they can be efficiently absorbed by the gas .",
    "the transition occurs at lower columns in the solar case compared to the depleted abundance case , i.e. @xmath53 compared to @xmath54 , because the higher metal abundances allows the required optical depth for interaction to be achieved at lower hydrogen columns .     for both cases , and the x - ray temperatures",

    "our results are in broad agreement with the previous calculations of ig99 for the same stellar and disc properties .",
    "the calculations include a two - temperature average representation of the coup x - ray sources in the orion nebula custer ( wolk et al .",
    "2005 ) . in essentially all cases , the effects of the x - rays fade by a vertical depth @xmath55 gr @xmath56 at 1 au , a very small fraction of the disc thickness at that radius .",
    "this finite depth occurs because penetrating high - energy x - rays interact with matter through the compton effect , rather than by photoelectric absorption .",
    "the ionization rate at such depths for a typical yso is @xmath57 , significantly smaller than the potential contributions from the radiative decay of galactic @xmath58al ( stepinski 1992 ) or shielded cosmic rays ( cleeves et al .",
    "as shown in the figures , the effects of scattering appear at even smaller vertical columns near @xmath59 , consistent with the thomson cross section .",
    "there are significant differences in the ionisation rates between the simple one - temperature thermal spectra used by ig99 and the two - temperature fits to the x - ray observations .",
    "in particular , after normalising to the same x - ray luminosity , the ionisation rates based on the coup observtaions are systematically higher at large column densities and systematically lower at low column densities than the ig99 calculations ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "the change occurs at typical column densities that depend on the radius and on the abundances used .",
    "typical differences are of order half a magnitude for calculations employing depleted ism abundances ( table 1 ) and a little more than a magnitude for solar abundances , as shown in figure  6 . the effects on the electron abundance will be less , however , because it depends on the square root of the ionization rate ( e.g.  dmkovics et al .",

    "the calculations in this paper are relevant for a number of astrophysical problems . in the upper atmosphere of the inner disc ( @xmath60 ) ,",
    "x - ray ionization affects the chemistry and thus the molecular spectroscopy of the disc .",
    "below , the x - rays help determine the geometry of the dead - zone associated with the magneto - rotational instability , especially its vertical thickness .",
    "on the other hand , stellar x - rays do not play a role on the ionization of the mid - plane region of the dead - zone , where other processes may be at work ( e.g. , turner & drake 2009 ; mohanty et al .",
