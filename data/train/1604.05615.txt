    "one of the main goals of computational solid state physics is the simulation of `` hypothetical '' compounds that have not been synthesized in the experimental lab . driven by its remarkable predictive power , density functional theory ( dft ) is today the most important tool in the field . together with the high level of sophistication that synthesis technology has reached , the vision of materials design ( i.e. the composition of functional materials that are tuned for usage in specific devices ) seems to become reality .",
    "control on the atomic level in materials synthesis e.g. with modern molecular beam epitaxy and pulsed laser deposition lead to an increasing focus on heterogeneous superstructures and effects associated with interfaces and surfaces .",
    "especially oxide superstructures @xcite attracted lots of attention due to partially extraordinary physics@xcite unknown in the bulk materials but also adatom lattices or graphene grown on functional substrates are in the focus of current experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "in our dft study we concentrate on a particular quality of functional materials which is largely affected by its surface and crucial to many applications : the work function @xmath0 . devices that make use of thermionic electron emission@xcite , catalytic surface properties@xcite , construction of schottky barriers@xcite , or the conception of organic electronics @xcite are some of the technologies for which knowledge of the work function is essential .",
    "one of the main motivations for our study can be attributed to the very recent conception of so called thermoelectronic devices @xcite which rely on the thermionic emission of an emitter and the subsequent condensation on a collector material .",
    "being , so to speak , the next evolutionary step following thermionic energy convertors , the new devices strive for a breakthrough in thermal to electrical energy conversion .",
    "two main aspects are key for the novel setups : i ) stability towards surface degradation also at elevated temperatures and ii ) emitter and collector materials with work functions tuned to one another . due to these two criteria",
    "we focus our study on transition metal oxide ( tmo ) materials : most tmos are thermally very stable and have high melting points . moreover , we know from an extensive body of research that tmos are sensitive to external perturbations ( i.e. they are _ tunable _ ) which lead to rich phase diagrams@xcite",
    ".    if we turn to past studies of density functional theory on materials work functions we find a good amount of research for simple metals @xcite , molecular structures@xcite and simple oxides like mgo and zno @xcite on metal surfaces , sc@xmath1o@xmath2 with adsorbed ba @xcite , modified silicon ( 111 ) surfaces @xcite , and even graphene @xcite . yet ,",
    "tmo work functions have been rarely studied and only recently started to attract attention@xcite .    in the present study",
    "we clarify the sensitivity of tmo work functions with respect to the specific surface termination , surface relaxation , surface reconstruction , defect structures ( i.e. oxygen vacancies ) , externally induced surface strain , electronic interactions on the mean - field level ( i.e. inclusion of a hubbard u ) , and most importantly , material trends for a number of perovskite oxides and superstructures .",
    "our findings will not only serve as a reference for the presented compounds but especially the observed parameter trends present a first systematic step towards a broader understanding of how to push a compounds work function to the desired value .",
    "the manuscript is organized in the following way : after reporting details of our calculation scheme in section [ methods ] we divide our results in three sections . in section [ resultsa ]",
    "we report on the sensitivity of the work function on `` external '' and calculation parameters .",
    "while some of the calculation parameters serve purely as a dft benchmark ( e.g. choice of the dft functional or the hubbard interaction u ) , others will be quite relevant for comparison to experimental dependencies ( e.g. lattice strain or oxygen vacancies ) . in section [ resultsb ]",
    "we explore the material trends for different abo@xmath2 perovskite oxides . in section [ resultsc ]",
    "we consider the potential of tuning work functions with heterostructuring oxide materials .",
    "the work function is defined as the minimal energy required to remove an electron from inside the material across its surface into the vacuum .",
    "conceptually the work function can be devided into a `` bulk '' and `` surface '' dependent part .",
    "if there were no charge redistribution at a materials surface and the vacuum potential would be set to v@xmath3 , the work function would be equivalent to @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the materials fermi energy ) .",
    "( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "in reality , however , ionic and electronic charge in the vicinity to the surface is very different from the bulk and an additional electric field is generated by the non vanishing dipole moment of the shifted charge arrangement .",
    "it is intuitively clear that generally such a field , and therefore also the work function , depends on the specific surface indices and termination . for our studies",
    "we assume clean surfaces with well defined terminations .",
    "let us remark already here that while there are many materials , in particular simple metals @xcite , which show little dependence of the work function on microscopic details of the surface , tmo work functions are extremely sensitive to these details .",
    "plane averaged electrostatic potential of a symmetric srruo@xmath2 slab consisting of six sro layers , five ruo@xmath1 layers , and a 20 vacuum .",
    "the electrostatic potential is defined with respect to fermi energy @xmath5 , and converges to a constant value in the vacuum region that is the work function @xmath0 of srruo@xmath2 with sro surface termination .",
    "@xmath0 therefore indicates the required energy to remove an electron at fermi level from the material to a state at rest in the vacuum nearby the surface.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this study we have selected a number of perovskite transition metal oxides abo@xmath2 ( where a = ca , sr , ba ; b=3d , ti - co ; 4@xmath6 : zr - rh ) and their heterostructures .",
    "the abo@xmath2 structure can be viewed as simple cubic lattice of a atoms with a body centered b atom and oxygen atoms in the face centers . in the following we consider surfaces along the ( 001 ) direction which are the most commonly studied surfaces in thin film or heterostructure compounds . in this direction",
    "the crystal is build up by an alternating stacking of ao and bo@xmath1 layers @xcite .",
    "the ( 001 ) abo@xmath2 then have either ao or bo@xmath1 surface terminations , and thus two intrinsically different work functions .",
    "for the calculation of the work function within a dft framework we employ a symmetric slab geometry which is sketched in the top part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the example of srruo@xmath2 .",
    "the sro terminated srruo@xmath2 slab consists of six sro layers , five ruo@xmath1 layers , and a vacuum thickness of 20 ; for bo@xmath1 terminated surface ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) we add an additional bo@xmath1 layer on each side of the slab .",
    "the work function @xmath0 is then calculated as the energy difference between the plane averaged electrostatic potential ( excluding the exchange correlation part ) of the slab in the vacuum region and the fermi level as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; benchmark calculations confirmed that @xmath0 is converged with this setup .",
    "for further information on the calculation of the averaged electrostatic potential we refer to and .",
    "since we are mostly interested in materials and superstructures grown on substrates , the in - plane lattice constant was fixed to a=3.905which is that of an assumed undistorted cubic srtio@xmath2 substrate ( it is also very close to the bulk lattice constant a=3.923of cubic srruo@xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "for all calculations the internal atomic positions were relaxed .",
    "the calculations were performed with the vasp ( vienna ab initio simulation package ) code @xcite using the generalized gradient approximation gga -pbe functional @xcite for electronic exchange and correlation and a 16@xmath716@xmath71 k - point grid including the @xmath8 point . in a set of selected benchmark calculations",
    "we compare the gga results also to those obtained by a local - density approximation ( lda ) functional@xcite .",
    "while the latter one generally leads to somewhat larger values of the work function , our main conclusions about materials trends and sensitivities remain unchanged by the choice of the functional .",
    "let us also explicitly mention that this study is not concerned with the temperature dependence of the work functions . while motivated by applications and devices which operate at elevated temperatures the non - trivial inclusion of finite temperatures in dft calculations is beyond the scope of this study .",
