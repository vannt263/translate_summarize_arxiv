    "multi - component silicate glasses are technologically important insulating structural materials , usually containing trace paramagnetic impurities ( typically fe@xmath0 and fe@xmath1 from the fabrication process ) . such dilute impurities give rise to nearly - ideal langevin paramagnetism that can be exploited in low - temperature thermometry  @xcite .",
    "a by - product of the magnetization measurements ( usually through squid magnetometry ) is the determination of the impurity concentration ( in the atomic ppm region ) .",
    "for example : commercial borosilicate glasses bk7 ( optical glass ) and schott s duran ( laboratory glass ) have ( reportedly  @xcite ) about 6 ppm and 120 ppm ( or 180 ppm  @xcite ) of diluted iron impurities , respectively , according to squid - magnetometry .",
    "knowledge of such paramagnetic impurity concentration is important also where the fundamental physics of disordered solids is concerned . at low temperatures ( below 1 k , normally ) the physics of a disordered solid",
    "is known to be dominated by low - energy excitations that go under the name of tunneling systems ( tss )  @xcite .",
    "these tss are dynamical defects that give rise to quasi - universal physical properties that can also be exploited in low - temperature thermometry  @xcite .",
    "a celebrated example is the excess ts contribution to the real part @xmath2 of the dielectric constant at low frequency , which depends logarithmically on the temperature @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "after 40 years of research , however , the precise microscopic nature of the tss is still a mystery .",
    "more recently , this dielectric constant @xmath2 has been discovered to be sensitive to weak magnetic fields ( @xmath4  10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6 g )  @xcite for some multi - component silicate glasses and possible explanations for this unexpected magnetic effect ( observed also in other physical properties  @xcite ) that have been proposed involve nuclear quadrupole moments  @xcite , structural inhomogeneities  @xcite and also paramagnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a precise determination of the impurity concentration is essential also in order to decide among different explanations for the magnetic effects .",
    "research on the ultimate nature of the tss is , moreover , receiving renewed interest in view of the fact that the tss have been recognized to be the cause of decoherence in josephson - junction based quantum computing devices ( the tunneling jj barrier being typically amorphous )  @xcite .",
    "moreover , studies of aging  @xcite in glasses ( hard and polymeric )  @xcite at very low temperatures depend on a more complete description of the physics of the tss .",
    "the issue of the origin of the magnetic effects therefore helps in improving knowledge about the nature of the tss so as to minimize  @xcite ( or exploit  @xcite ) their decoherence ( or coherence ) effect in scjj qubits .",
    "the study of the structure of real glasses at low temperatures provides , in turn , alternative information on the mechanism for the glass transition ( normally investigated from the liquid state  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate mainly the issue of the determination via squid magnetization of the concentration @xmath7 of paramagnetic impurities  @xcite , also in view of the fact that the theoretical analysis  @xcite of the magnetic effect  @xcite in the heat capacity @xmath8 of some multi - silicate glasses produced values of @xmath7 systematically much lower than those quoted in the literature  @xcite ( and obtained from squid measurements ) .",
    "we briefly review the analysis of some @xmath9 data in the range 0.6 to 1.3 k  @xcite , then apply our model to the calculation of the ts contribution to the magnetization @xmath10 and analyze the available magnetization @xmath11 data in the range 4 to 300 k  @xcite with our formula added to langevin s contribution from the paramagnetic impurities .",
    "we find that the concentrations @xmath7 of such impurities extracted from both types of measurements will get to agree with each other only when the ts contributions ( from our model , e.g. ) to both @xmath9 and @xmath11 get to be added to langevin s known expressions for the paramagnetic impurities contributions .",
    "we apply our analysis to available data for the borosilicate duran glass and for the multi - silicate glass of composition al@xmath12o@xmath13-bao - sio@xmath12 ( in short albasio , or bas , reported concentration @xmath14  100 ppm  @xcite ) since these glasses have shown the most remarkable magnetic effects  @xcite .",
    "the concentrations @xmath7 that we find for the fe impurities are , however , about 60 to 80% lower than those quoted in the literature for these glasses , so the correct description of the magnetic - sensitive tss becomes important also for the applications of low - temperature physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the foundations of the extended tunneling model that we use , then in section 3 we apply the model to the explanation of the magnetic effect in the @xmath9 data . in section 4",
    "we derive the contribution from the tss in our model to the magnetization @xmath11 and analyze the available data with our formula .",
    "the values of @xmath7 extracted from both quantities @xmath8 and @xmath10 are compared in section 5 , which also contains our conclusions . in the appendix we present some preliminary results for the analysis of some measurements in bk7 glass .",
    "the modern justification for the tunneling model is based on the belief that glasses at sufficiently low temperatures are characterized by a potential energy landscape ( pel ) , that can be investigated only by means of classical computer simulations of atomic configurations . out of the many local minima of the pel",
    "some local potentials , normally thought to be double - welled ( dwp ) , give rise to tss , normally replaced by two - level systems ( 2lss ) that at low temperatures are characterized by the tunneling hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath15 here the parameters @xmath16 ( the energy asymmetry ) and @xmath17 ( twice the tunneling parameter ) are typically characterized by a probability distribution that views @xmath16 and @xmath18 ( the latter linked to the dwp energy barrier ) broadly ( in fact uniformly ) distributed throughout the disordered solid  @xcite : @xmath19 where some cutoffs are introduced when needed and where @xmath20 is a material - dependent parameter , like the cutoffs . in this justification of the tss clearly the tunneling `` particle '' can not be typically a real atom / ion of the glass , but rather an effective , fictitious particle : jumps between contiguous low - lying minima of the pel correspond to the rearrangements of several atoms / ions , if not large parts of the entire atomic configuration .    much progress has been done in understanding the physics of glasses at low temperatures with the help of the above simple model ( the standard tunneling model , stm )  @xcite , which has however important limitations . the recently discovered magnetic effects in non - magnetic glasses  @xcite , for example , can not be explained without a suitable extension of the stm .",
    "our own extension brings three realistic considerations in the modeling of the structure of real glasses .",
    "the first is that glasses can be no longer considered fully homogeneously disordered solids at the intermediate atomic scales , for there is mounting experimental evidence that the structure is spatially inhomogeneous with `` better ordered '' regions being inter - dispersed in an otherwise featureless homogeneously disordered matrix .",
    "one way to look at these regions of enhanced atomic ordering is that they are the thermal - history continuation to temperatures below the glass transition temperature @xmath21  @xcite of the slower - particles regions present , within the sea of faster - particle regions , in the dynamical - heterogeneity picture  @xcite of the supercooled liquid phase , between @xmath21 and the melting temperature @xmath22 .",
    "these slower - particle regions are in fact also better ordered , as expected .",
    "we name these regions in the glassy phase _ regions of enhanced regularity _ ( rers ) , but some other names have been proposed in the literature : _ cybotactic groupings _ from a critical analysis of the x - ray and neutron scattering data in amorphous solids  @xcite , _ para - crystals _ from combined electron - diffraction and fluctuation electron microscopy of _ a_-si films  @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions about partial devitrification have been reported for the metallic glass zr@xmath23cu@xmath24al@xmath25 using combined monte carlo simulation and fluctuation electron microscopy  @xcite .",
    "besides , the amorphous solids of general composition ( mgo)@xmath26(al@xmath12o@xmath13)@xmath27(sio@xmath12)@xmath28 are termed _ ceramic glasses _ and are even known to contain embedded micro - crystals  @xcite . the evidence from x - ray analysis for crystalline - like ordering in quenched network glasses is in fact most compelling in the case of multi - component materials  @xcite . for these glasses",
    "the distribution ( [ 2lsdistribution ] ) of the 2ls parameters should be partially abandoned in favour of a different distribution , for a subsystem of tss nesting within the rers , having a form favouring the near - symmetry of the local wells of the dwp , e.g. : @xmath29 where the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 now refer to that subsystem .",
    "one should then use at the very least  @xcite a collection of the two types of tss described above when dealing with multi - component glasses ( for which the strongest magnetic effects have been observed ) .",
    "the second consideration is that the computer - generated pel typically contains more complicated , local multi - welled potentials ( mwps ) as well as dwps ( indeed , a representation of the pel solely by means of dwps and 2lss seems rather oversimplified , though of obvious practical theoretical advantage  @xcite ) . in fig .  [ landscape ] the one - dimensional map of a molecular dynamics - generated pel for a system of 32 particles interacting through a binary mixture",
    "lennard - jones potential in the glassy phase has been reproduced  @xcite .",
    "there are clearly dwps , but also mwps as we have highlighted .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian of a mwps is easily written down as  @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the energy asymmetries between the wells ( we have chosen the simplest case , having three wells ) and @xmath34 is the most relevant tunneling amplitude ( through saddles of the pel , in fact ) .",
    "this 3ls hamiltonian has the advantage of readily allowing for the inclusion of a magnetic field @xmath35 , when coupling orbitally with a tunneling `` particle '' having charge @xmath36 ( @xmath36 being some multiple of the electron s charge @xmath37 )  @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the peierls phase for the tunneling particle through a saddle in the field , and @xmath40 is the aharonov - bohm phase for a tunneling loop and is given by the usual formula : @xmath41 @xmath42 being the appropriate flux quantum ( @xmath43 is planck s constant ) and @xmath44 the magnetic flux threading the area @xmath45 formed by the tunneling paths of the particle in this simple model .",
    "the energy asymmetries @xmath33 typically enter through their combination @xmath46 .",
    "one can easily convince oneself that if such a mwp is used with the standard parameter distribution , eq .",
    "( [ 2lsdistribution ] ) with @xmath47 replacing @xmath48 , for the description of the ts , one would then obtain essentially the same physics as for the stm 2ls - description . in other words , there is no need to complicate the minimal 2ls - description in order to study glasses at low temperatures , unless structural inhomogeneities of the rer - type and a magnetic field are present . without the rers , hence no distribution of the type ( [ nd2lsdistribution ] ) , the interference from separate tunneling paths is only likely to give rise to a very weak aharonov - bohm effect",
    "hence , it will be those tss nesting within the rers that will give rise to an enhanced a - b effect and these tss can be minimally described  for example  through hamiltonian ( [ 3lsmagtunneling ] ) and with distribution ( [ nd2lsdistribution ] ) thus modified to favour near - degeneracy  @xcite : @xmath49 we remark that the incipient `` crystallinity '' of the rers calls for near - degeneracy in @xmath33 simultaneously and not in a single one of them , hence the correlated form of ( [ atsdistribution ] ) .",
    "other descriptions , with four - welled potentials or modified three - dimensional dwps are possible for the tss nested in the rers and lead to the same physics as from eqs .",
    "( [ 3lsmagtunneling ] ) and ( [ atsdistribution ] ) above  @xcite ( which describe what we call the anomalous tunneling systems , or atss , nesting within the rers ) .",
    "the final and most important consideration is that the tss appear to be rather diluted defects in the glass ( indeed their concentration is of the order of magnitude of that for trace paramagnetic impurities , as we shall see ) , hence the tunneling `` particles '' are embedded in a medium otherwise characterized only by simple acoustic - phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "this embedding , however , means that the rest of the material takes a part in the making of the tunneling potential for the ts s `` particle '' , which itself is not moving quantum - mechanically in a vacuum .",
    "sussmann  @xcite has shown that this leads to local trapping potentials that ( for the case of triangular and tetrahedral perfect symmetry ) must be characterized by a degenerate ground state .",
    "this means that , as a consequence of this ts embedding , our minimal model ( [ 3lsmagtunneling ] ) must be chosen with a positive tunneling parameter  @xcite : @xmath50 where of course perfect degeneracy is always removed by weak disorder in the asymmetries .",
    "the intrinsic near - degeneracy of ( [ atsdistribution ] ) implies that this model should be used in its @xmath51 limit , which in turn reduces the atss to effective magnetic - field dependent 2lss and greatly simplifies the analysis together with the limit @xmath52 which we always take for relatively weak magnetic fields .",
    "our extended tunneling model ( etm ) consists then in a collection of independent , non - interacting 2lss described by the stm and 3lss described by eqs .",
    "( [ 3lsmagtunneling ] ) and ( [ atsdistribution ] ) above in the said @xmath51 and @xmath52 limits , the 3lss nested within the rers and the magnetic - field insensitive 2lss distributed in the remaining homogeneously - disordered matrix .",
    "( proportional to the magnetic field @xmath53 ) and different energies ( @xmath54 has been set to 1 ) .",
    "the shape of this part of the dos ( coming from the mwps with a parameter distribution ( [ atsdistribution ] ) favouring near - degeneracy ) is the ultimate source of all the magnetic effects .",
    "the cusp is an artifact of the effective 2ls approximation  @xcite , but also of the existence of upper and lower bounds for @xmath34 owing to the nature of the rer atomic structure . ]",
    "our etm has been able to explain the magnetic effects in the heat capacity  @xcite , in the real  @xcite and imaginary  @xcite parts of the dielectric constant and in the polarization echo amplitude  @xcite measurements reported to date for various glasses at low temperatures , as well as the composition - dependent anomalies  @xcite .",
    "the new physics is provided by the magnetic - field dependent ts density of states ( dos ) which acquires a term due to the near - degenerate mwps  @xcite that gets added up to the ( nearly ) constant dos from the stm 2lss ( having density @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the atss concentration , @xmath58 is a magnetic - field dependent dimensionless function , already described in previous papers  @xcite , and @xmath59 is a material and @xmath53-dependent cutoff .",
    "the @xmath60 dependence is a consequence of the chosen tunneling parameter distribution , eq .",
    "( [ atsdistribution ] ) ( or , to the same effect , eq .",
    "( [ nd2lsdistribution ] ) ) , and gives rise to a peak in @xmath61 near @xmath59 that is rapidly eroded away as soon as a weak magnetic field is switched on .",
    "the form and evolution of the magnetic part of the dos is shown in fig .",
    "[ dosfig ] for some typical parameters , as a function of @xmath53 for different values of @xmath62 .",
    "this behaviour of the dos with @xmath53 is , essentially , the underlying mechanism for all of the experimentally observed magnetic field effects in the cold glasses within this model : the measured physical properties are convolutions of this dos ( with appropriate @xmath53-independent functions ) and in turn reproduce its shape as functions of @xmath53 . as an example , the total ts heat capacity is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the heat capacity contribution from a single ts having energy gap @xmath62 .",
    "we end this section by mentioning that in model simulation studies of the 2lss generated by defects in perfect crystals , churkin , barash , and schechter  @xcite found non - uniform behaviour for the @xmath65 dos very similar to what we advocate in eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) for the ats part ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , fig . 6 for @xmath53=0 ) .",
    "the ( near- ) crystallinity is thus the common theme between the rers in glasses and the twin - caged defects in crystals .",
    "a much deeper justification for our ats model and for the nature of the tss in general ( of two types only : the 2lss and the three- or four - fold atss ) will be presented elsewhere , for glasses ( papers in preparation ) .",
    "in this section we re - analyze the available data  @xcite for the magnetic effect in the heat capacity of two multi - component glasses , commercial borosilicate duran and barium - allumo - silicate ( bas ) glass , in order to better estimate the concentration of trace fe - impurities in this way .",
    "the presence of a magnetic effect in the pyrex glass was reported long ago by stephens  @xcite and attributed solely to paramagnetic iron impurities even though the maximum effect was for @xmath66 .",
    "a systematic experimental study of @xmath9 around and below 1 k in some multi - silicate glasses was carried out by siebert  @xcite and those data have been used , upon permission , by one of us  @xcite as the very first test of the above ( section 2 ) etm  @xcite .",
    "that earlier analysis best - fitted the @xmath8 data by siebert with the sum of einstein s @xmath67 phonon term plus the 2ls @xmath68 non - magnetic contributions , as well as with langevin s paramagnetic and the ats contributions ( see below ) .",
    "the analysis came up with concentrations @xmath6948 ppm and , respectively , @xmath69 20 ppm instead of the quoted  @xcite 126 ppm ( or 180 ppm in a different study  @xcite ) and 102 ppm for duran and for bas glass , respectively .",
    "in order to better understand this large discrepancy we begin with by re - analysing siebert s data for @xmath9 , after subtraction of the data taken at the same temperatures for the same glass , but in the presence of the strongest applied magnetic field ( 8  t ) . in this way",
    "only the magnetic - field dependent contributions should remain in the data for @xmath70 .",
    "it should be remarked that use of these data for @xmath8 is marred by the question of the many relaxation times in a glass , since the data are obtained indirectly ( like in all @xmath8 measurements in glasses at low @xmath3 ) , from a heat - pulse experiment where the change with time of the sample s temperature is fitted with a single relaxation time involving @xmath8 .",
    "the data thus obtained for @xmath8 , however , strongly resemble those obtained earlier on by stephens ( at @xmath53=0 and 3.3 t only )  @xcite and there is theoretical evidence that the width of the relaxation times distribution narrows considerably in a magnetic field for a multi - component glass  @xcite .",
    "still , we use the data of @xcite tentatively .",
