    "with the large and homogeneous redshift surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al.2000 ) and two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) , our view of the local universe became extended out to a few hundred mega parsecs . from such dense redshift surveys ,",
    "the small - scale distribution of galaxies is also being revealed in more detail .",
    "it is now possible to make very accurate measurements of various relations among the physical properties of galaxies and the local environment .",
    "this is a difficult task , which should be completed before theoretical modeling and interpretations are attempted .",
    "the study is complicated because there are many physical parameters involved and their mutual relations are non - trivially interrelated .",
    "a further complication is the fact that definition of environment depends on the type of objects chosen to trace the large scale - structure .",
    "one could divide the physical properties of galaxies into internal and collective ones .",
    "examples of internal physical properties are color , luminosity , morphology , star formation rate , velocity dispersion , surface brightness , spectral type , size , and so on .",
    "collective properties can be the strength and statistical nature of spatial clustering , peculiar velocity field , luminosity function , velocity dispersion distribution function , halo mass function , axis ratio distribution function and so on ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the local environments can be spatial or temporal .",
    "dependence on the latter means the evolution in cosmic time . ",
    "spatial environment  can have various meanings .",
    "traditionally discrete types , such as cluster , group , field , or void , are used to distinguish among different environments of galaxies .",
    "recently , the smoothed number density of neighboring galaxies was also used to represent the environment .",
    "one could also use other parameters to define the environment of galaxies .",
    "density gradient , shear fields , and large - scale peculiar velocity fields can be important parameters affecting the properties of galaxies .",
    "the relations among all these physical observables and environment can give us information on galaxy formation and the background universe .",
    "many authors in the past have investigated the relations between environment and galaxy properties ( lewis et al .",

    "baldry et al . ( 2004 ) analyzed the bivariate distribution of the sdss galaxies in the color versus absolute magnitude space .",
    "the fundamental plane and the color - magnitude - velocity dispersion relation for early type galaxies with sdss have been investigated by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003a , 2005 ) very recently desroches et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the fundamental plane projections of elliptical galaxies depend on luminosity using dr4 of the sdss .",
    "in particular , they found that the radius - luminosity and faber - jackson relations are steeper at high luminosity , which we also found in our work using a larger sdss sample with morphologically cleaner early type samples .",
    "sheth et al . ( 2003 ) and mitchell et al .",

    "this paper focuses on understanding of the relationship among many physical properties of galaxies using a set of volume - limited samples of the sdss galaxies , which are further divided into subsamples of constant morphology and absolute magnitude .",
    "this well - controlled experiment allows us to measure the relations among internal and collective properties as a function of morphology and luminosity . in our companion paper",
    "we have studied the dependence of various galaxy properties on the local density environment ( park et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe our catalog and morphology classification and the physical parameters that we use in section 3 and 4 to investigate the relations among the galaxy properties .",
    "we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "the sdss ( york et al . 2000 ; stoughton et al . 2002 ; adelman - mccarthy et al . 2006 ) is a survey to explore the large - scale distribution of galaxies and quasars by using a dedicated @xmath15 telescope at apache point observatory ( gunn et al .",
    "the photometric survey has imaged roughly @xmath16 sr of the northern galactic cap in five photometric bandpasses denoted by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 centered at @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , by an imaging camera with 54 ccds ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ; gunn et al .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of photometry at a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath24 are @xmath25 , and @xmath26 in the five bandpasses , respectively .",

    "2004 ) . after image processing ( lupton et al . 2001",

    "2002 ; ivezi et al .",
    "2004 ; tucker et al .",
    "2006 ) , targets are selected for spectroscopic follow - up observation . the spectroscopic survey is planned to continue through 2008 as the legacy survey and to yield about @xmath29 galaxy spectra .",
    "the spectra are obtained by two dual fiber - fed ccd spectrographs .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath30 , and the rms uncertainty in redshift is @xmath31 km s@xmath12 . because of the mechanical constraint of using fibers , no two fibers can be placed closer than @xmath32 on the same tile . mainly due to this fiber collision constraint ,",
    "incompleteness of spectroscopy survey reaches about 6% ( blanton et al .",
    "2003b ) in such a way that regions with high surface densities of galaxies become less prominent even after adaptive overlapping of multiple tiles .",
    "this angular variation of sampling density is accounted for in our analysis .",
    "the sdss spectroscopy yields three major samples : the main galaxy sample , the luminous red galaxy sample ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the quasar sample ( richards et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the main galaxy sample is a magnitude - limited sample with an apparent petrosian @xmath19-magnitude cut of @xmath33 , which is the limiting magnitude for spectroscopy ( strauss et al .",
    "it has a further cut in petrosian half - light surface brightness @xmath34 mag / arcsec@xmath35 .",
    "more details about the survey can be found on the sdss web site .    in our study of galaxy properties",
    ", we use a subsample of sdss galaxies known as the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; blanton et al 2005 ) .",
    "this sample is a subset of the recent sdss data release 5 .",
    "one of the products of the nyu - vagc used here is a large - scale structure sample dr4plus ( lss - dr4plus ) . for local density estimation in the three - dimensional redshift space in our accompanying paper",
    "we use galaxies within the boundaries shown in figure 1 of paper ii , which improves the volume - to - surface area ratio of the survey .",
    "there are also three stripes in the southern galactic cap observed by sdss .",
    "density estimation is difficult within these narrow stripes , so for consistency with the samples examined in the accompanying paper , we do not use them . the remaining survey region covers @xmath36 deg@xmath35 .",
    "the primary sample of galaxies used here is a subset of the lss - dr4plus sample referred to as ",
    "void0  , which is further selected to have apparent magnitudes in the range @xmath37 and redshifts in the range @xmath38 .",
    "these cuts yield a sample of 312,338 galaxies .",
    "the roughly 6% of targeted galaxies that do not have a measured redshift due to fiber collisions are assigned the redshift of their nearest neighbor .    completeness of the sdss is poor for bright galaxies with @xmath39 because of both the spectroscopic selection criteria ( which excludes objects with large flux within the 3@xmath40 fiber aperture ; the cut at @xmath41 is an empirical approximation of the completeness limit caused by that cut ) and the difficulty of obtaining correct photometry for objects with large angular size .",
    "for these reasons , analysis of sdss galaxy samples have typically been limited to @xmath42 .",
    "this is unfortunate because it limits the range of luminosity that can be probed ; using the magnitude limits of the void0 sample the range of absolute magnitude is only about 3.1 at a given redshift . to extend the range of magnitude , we attempt to complete the redshift sample by supplementing the catalog with redshifts of bright galaxies , first from sdss itself , and then by matching to earlier redshift catalogs ( the missing galaxies are quite bright and easily observed by earlier surveys ) . we employ another subset of the lss - dr4plus sample referred as bvoid , which is made before redshift determination and includes galaxies with @xmath39 .",
    "galaxies in bvoid with sdss redshifts are added to the catalog . for those objects lacking redshifts , we searched earlier catalogs . out of @xmath43 bright objects with @xmath39 in the bvoid sample and within our survey region ,",
    "we assign redshifts to 3945 galaxies cross matched with the updated zwicky catalog ( uzc ; falco et al .",
    "1999 ) , 807 galaxies from the bvoid sample after redshift determination , 69 galaxies from the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) redshift catalog ] ( zcat 2000 version ) , and 4 galaxies from the _ iras _ point source catalog redshift survey ( saunders et al .",
    "we found 336 bright objects to be errors , such as outlying parts of a large galaxies that were deblended by the automated photometric pipeline , blank fields , stars , etc .",
    "out of the remaining 66 objects , 30 galaxies are included in our sample , using redshifts from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "only 36 galaxies remain in the bright bvoid sample with no measured redshift .",
    "in addition to these bright bvoid galaxies , which have been selected based on their @xmath19-band magnitudes , we have included the redshifts of 340 uzc galaxies cross - matched with sdss objects in nyu - vagc , which were not included in the previous step . out of 6295 uzc galaxies within our survey region , 242 are still not matched with sdss objects in the nyu - vagc .",
    "ofthe missing uzc galaxies , 60% have redshifts smaller than our inner redshift cut of @xmath44 , leaving only 99 galaxies missing at larger redshift .    in total ,",
    "we add 5195 bright ( @xmath39 ) galaxies to the void0 samples , which yields a final sample of 317533 galaxies .",
    "volume - limited samples derived from the resulting catalog have nearly constant comoving number density of galaxies along the radial direction at redshift @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we treat our final samples as having no bright limit at redshift greater than @xmath44 .      in this study",
    "we use only volume - limited samples of galaxies selected by absolute magnitude and redshift limits .",
    "figure 2 shows the definitions of our six subsamples in redshift - absolute magnitude space .",
    "the shallowest subsample is labeled cm , which stands for ` color - magnitude ' .",
    "we employ the cm sample to extend some of our analyses to fainter absolute magnitude .",

    "this means that a galaxy at @xmath73 has a @xmath66-correction of @xmath74 , independent of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we have applied the same mean luminosity evolution correction formula to individual galaxies .",

    ", we retrieve the @xmath18- and @xmath20-band atlas images and basic photometric parameters of all galaxies in our sample from the archive of photometric reductions conducted by the princeton / nyu group .",
    "to take into account flattening or inclination of galaxies , we use elliptical annuli in all parameter calculations , and the isophotal position angle and axis ratio in the @xmath20-band are used to define the elliptical annuli .",

    "the @xmath3 color gradient , concentration index , and isophotal axis ratios are corrected for the effects of seeing . to do so , we first generate a large set of sersic model images with various scaling lengths , slopes , and axis ratios convolved with a range of psf sizes . for an observed galaxy image with a given size of the psf we look for a best - fit sersic model when the sersic model is convolved with the psf to find the true sersic index and the true axis ratio .",

    "the @xmath3 color gradient and concentration index are calculated for the true sersic models and their differences from those of convolved images are used to correct the color gradient of the observed image for the seeing effects .",
    "we classify galaxy morphologies into early ( ellipticals and lenticulars ) and late ( spirals and irregulars ) types using the automated galaxy morphological classification method given by park & choi ( 2005 ) , who showed that incorporating the @xmath3 color gradient into the classification parameter space allows us to successfully separate the two populations degenerated in @xmath2 color and the concentration index helps us separate red disky spirals from early type galaxies ( see fig . 1 of park & choi 2005 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the `` morphological '' properties of galaxies can change when different bands are adopted .",
    "the difference in morphology in different bands is exactly the color distribution , which is reflected in our color gradient parameter . to define the classification boundaries in this multi - parameter space , they used a training set of 1982 sdss galaxies whose morphological types are visually identified .",
    "the distributions of the early and late type galaxies in sample d2 are shown in figures 6@xmath87 and 6@xmath88 , below .",
    "the reader is referred to park & choi ( 2005 ) for further details of the methods and various tests .",
    "we have visually examined color images of a set of faint galaxies retrieved by the sdss image list , and confirmed that the resulting morphological classification is highly successful with completeness and reliability reaching 90% . for the volume - limited samples d2 and cm we made an additional visual check to correct possible misclassifications of the automated scheme for blue early types ( those below the straight line in fig .",
    "3@xmath87 ) and red late types ( those redder than @xmath89 in @xmath2 color ) .",
    "the morphological types of 1.9% of galaxies , which are often blended or merged objects , were changed by this procedure .",
    "this morphology classification allows us to make very accurate measurements in this study compared with previous work .",
    "we discuss this further in section 3.2 .",
    "we find that absolute magnitude and morphology are the most important parameters characterizing physical properties of galaxies , in the sense that other parameters show relatively little scatter once absolute magnitude and morphology are fixed .",
    "this is particularly true for early type galaxies .",
    "we begin this section by showing the dependence of various physical parameters of galaxies on their absolute magnitudes . in each case , we separately examine samples of early ( e / s0 ) and late ( s / irr ) morphological types .",
    "figure 3@xmath87 shows the color - absolute magnitude diagram of galaxies in the cm and d2 samples .",
    "galaxies in the cm sample are shown only for @xmath90 .",
    "the left panel shows the distribution of early types , and the right panel shows that of late types .",
    "the solid and dashed lines delineate the most probable @xmath2 color of galaxies in the d2 and cm samples , respectively .",
    "( here and throughout , the `` most probable '' parameter value within 0.4 absolute magnitude bin is the mode of the distribution of that parameter . )",
    "the most probable color of the red sequence galaxies has a break at @xmath91 and has slopes of about @xmath92 at the bright side and about @xmath93 at the faint side .",
    "we plot only those late type galaxies with axis ratios @xmath94 , to reduce the biases in absolute magnitude , color , color gradient , etc . , due to internal extinction .",
    "colors of late types have a much wider dispersion .",
    "their most probable color rapidly becomes bluer as galaxies become fainter , but is very insensitive to absolute magnitude fainter than @xmath95 , approaching @xmath96 at the very faint end ( @xmath97 , not shown ) .",
    "baldry et al . (",
    "2004 ) reported a slope of about @xmath98 for luminous red galaxies selected from the sdss , which is consistent with our measurement .",
    "one significant difference between baldry et al.s and our result is the color - magnitude relation of the late type ( blue distribution ) galaxies at the bright side . in their results",
    "the slope of the relation becomes less steep long before the color - magnitude relation for late types touches that of early types as one , toward brightest magnitude . on the other hand",
    ", our result shows no such bending until it approaches the relation for early types .",
    "the difference is probably caused by extinction of late type galaxies .",
    "figure 3@xmath87 shows that the color distribution of late type galaxies overlaps with early types at all magnitudes , and vice versa .",
    "the solid straight line in figure 3@xmath87 roughly divides the sequences of red and blue galaxies .",
    "however , about 24% of spiral",
    "/ irregular galaxies brighter than @xmath99 are above this line when all inclinations are allowed . among all galaxies above this line , 32% are actually late types",
    ". therefore , an early type sample generated by a simple cut in the absolute magnitude versus color space must take into account this huge contamination .",
    "we also find a significant fraction of early types located outside the main red sequence at faint magnitudes . at absolute magnitudes between @xmath100 and @xmath101 ,",
    "about 10% of early types are located below the straight line shown in figure 3@xmath87 .",
    "this outlying fraction is larger at fainter magnitudes",
    ". some of these blue early type galaxies may be actually spirals whose disks look too faint for both our automated and visual classification schemes to classify correctly , but the trend seems robust .",
    "again , it should be noted that even though the bimodality in galaxy color is mainly due to the bimodality in galaxy morphology , there is a significant overlap in color space between the two morphological classes . with few exceptions , very blue ( @xmath102 )",
    "early type galaxies show strong emission lines in their spectra , indicating active star formation ( see fig .",
    "6@xmath103 ) .",
    "the distributions of colors of early and late types at a given absolute magnitude are not gaussian",
    ". the colors of early types are skewed to blue color , and those of late types are skewed to red color .",
    "the blue sequence appears less prominent when the data is contaminated by internal extinction effects ( see fig .",
    "12 , below ) .",
    "figure 3@xmath88 shows distributions of galaxies in color gradient , @xmath104 , versus absolute magnitude , @xmath76 .",
    "we find that the majority of e / s0 s ( _ left panel _ ) have a weak negative color gradient ; the envelope is slightly bluer than the core .",
    "their most probable color gradient is surprisingly constant at @xmath105 at all magnitudes explored , with a weak trend for more positive gradient toward faint and bright magnitudes .",
    "interestingly , the e / s0 s with @xmath106 have the minimum color gradient .",
    "it should be noted that the color gradient of the brightest early types approaches zero , meaning that the brightest early types are reddest and most spatially homogeneous in color .",
    "although the most probable color gradient has a nearly constant of absolute magnitude , the number of e / s0 s with blue cores increases strongly at absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath107 .",
    "the color gradient of late type galaxies is more negative ( i.e. , bluer envelope ) than that of early types and is a slowly increasing function of absolute magnitude faint late types are more gas rich and have more uniform internal star formation activity , while bright late types have red central bulges and blue star forming disk structures .",
    "figure 3@xmath103 shows that the ( inverse ) concentration index @xmath108 of the early types ( _ left panel _ ) is nearly independent of absolute magnitude when @xmath109 , but rises rather steeply at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the most probable concentration index of the bright early types is close to that of a de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath110 ) , even though it slightly increases at the brightest end .",
    "the brightest early types might be less concentrated because of more recent mergers , and the galaxies only slightly brighter than @xmath111 , with @xmath112 might be dynamically older ( more relaxed ) . for late type galaxies",
    "the most probable value is close to the value an exponential disk ( @xmath113 ) at the brightest end , albeit with a large dispersion .",
    "the petrosian radius in units of @xmath114 kpc as a function of absolute magnitude is shown in figure 4@xmath87 .",
    "the petrosian radius is calculated by using the elliptical annuli , and is typically larger than the value in the sdss photometric database which uses the circular annuli .",
    "early type galaxies ( _ left panel _ ) exhibit a tight correlation between physical size and luminosity , and the relation has a significant curvature .",
    "the slope is very steep ( @xmath115 at @xmath116 ) at the brightest end .",
    "the late types have larger @xmath81 , and their size relation with absolute magnitude is less curved .",
    "the curvature of the relation for both early and late types means that fainter galaxies have lower surface brightness . as a guide",
    "the radius - magnitude relation in the case of constant surface brightness ( @xmath117 where @xmath118 is luminosity and @xmath119 is surface brightness ) is drawn in both panels .",
    "the slope of this relation to the bright end of the late types tells that the brightest spiral galaxies , with @xmath120 , have surface brightness approximately independent of luminosity .",
    "this relation is also true for the early types in the regime @xmath121 fainter than for the late types .",
    "desroches et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also found that the radius - luminosity relation of elliptical galaxies is steeper at high luminosity .",

    "<S> we examine volume - limited samples of galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey to look for relations among internal and collective physical parameters of galaxies as faint as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the internal physical properties of interest include morphology , luminosity , color , color gradient , concentration , size , velocity dispersion , equivalent width of @xmath1 line , and axis ratio . </S>",
    "<S> collective properties that we measure include the luminosity and velocity dispersion functions . </S>",
    "<S> we morphologically classify galaxies using the three dimensional parameter space of @xmath2 color , @xmath3 color gradient , and concentration index . </S>",
    "<S> all relations are inspected separately for early and late type galaxies . at fixed morphology and luminosity </S>",
    "<S> , we find that bright ( @xmath4 ) early type galaxies show very small dispersions in color , color gradient , concentration , size , and velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> these dispersions increase at fainter magnitudes , where the fraction of blue star - forming early types increases . </S>",
    "<S> late types show wider dispersions in all physical parameters compared to early types at the same luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> concentration indices of early types are well correlated with velocity dispersion , but are insensitive to luminosity and color for bright galaxies , in particular . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the faber - jackson relation ( @xmath5 ) continuously changes from @xmath6 to @xmath7 when luminosity changes from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the size of early types is well - correlated with stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath10 , when @xmath11 km s@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that passive spiral galaxies are well separated from star - forming late type galaxies at @xmath1 equivalent width of about 4 . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting finding is that many physical parameters of galaxies manifest different behaviors across the absolute magnitude of about @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology fraction as a function of luminosity depends less sensitively on large - scale structure than the luminosity function ( lf ) does , and thus seems to be more universal . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of internal extinction in late type galaxies on the completeness of volume - limited samples and on the lf and morphology fraction are found to be very important . </S>",
    "<S> an important improvement of our analyses over most previous works is that the extinction effects are effectively reduced by excluding the inclined late type galaxies with axis ratios of @xmath14 . </S>"
