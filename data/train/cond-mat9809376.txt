    "this paper is the sequel of a previous one@xcite ( henceforth referred to as i ) in which the so - called _ fundamental measure theory _ ( fmt )",
    "was applied to build a density functional for the multicomponent system of parallel hard cubes ( phc ) . in i",
    "we explained all fundamentals of the theory and gave a full account of the technical details involved in the derivation of the functional .",
    "we also discussed the pros and cons of the theory , as compared with more standard density functional theories ( dfts ) , and suggested some possible extensions .",
    "in this paper we apply the formalism developed in i to study the phase behaviour of the phc fluid , with special emphasis in its relevance for the understanding of the phase behaviour of mixtures .",
    "the phc fluid is a rather academic model and it possesses a bunch of ` peculiarities ' which are rather odd for a fluid model , e.g.  the uniform fluid is anisotropic at small scales ( the cubes are kept parallel to each other ) , freezing occurs at very low packing fractions ( around 0.30.4 ) and it is a continuous , instead of first order , transition ( a consequence of the lack of isotropy of the fluid phase ) , and the depletion in the binary mixture is very strong compared to hard spheres ( hs ) .",
    "but in spite of these peculiarities  which certainly make of this model a caricature of a fluid , the physics one can learn from its phase behaviour can be easily extended to more reasonable fluids , and it has the important added value of being a much simpler model to carry out analytical calculations ( even more : fmt seems to be somehow optimal for this model @xcite ) .",
    "there have been a few previous studies in the literature about the fluid of phc @xcite scattered in the last forty years , but the relevance of this model has only recently become apparent when it has been proposed as a model of a fluid able to demix by a purely entropic mechanism .",
    "@xcite    entropic demixing has been a long standing question which only recently begins to be understood .",
    "it is well known that different attractions between two types of particles in a fluid can produce segregation into two phases , each rich in one type of particles .",
    "@xcite the question remains whether hard particles , for which only an entropic balance can drive a phase transition , ever demix and how .",
    "it is clear that nonadditive mixtures ( mixtures in which particles of different type interact as if they had a larger volume ) do demix , @xcite but they have the segregation mechanism introduced at the interaction potential .",
    "so the nontrivial question concerns additive hard - particle mixtures .",
    "the question is tricky because the simplest model of this type ",
    "hs  was solved in percus - yevick ( py ) approximation @xcite and shown never to demix .",
    "@xcite it had to wait almost thirty years until the py result was questioned . by solving numerically the ornstein - zernike equation with closure relations more accurate than the py one",
    "a spinodal instability was shown to occur in a binary mixture of hs @xcite for a diameter ratio below 0.10.25 ( depending of the authors ) .",
    "it was then believed that a sufficiently asymmetric hs binary mixture undergoes fluid - fluid demixing in a certain region of the phase diagram . but successive experiments performed in suspensions of polystyrene or silica spheres ( which to a large accuracy can be considered hs ) showed cumulative evidence that demixing is coupled to freezing , and so one of the phases shows up as a crystal  sometimes a glass  of large particles . @xcite recent theoretical calculations confirm this scheme .",
    "@xcite    direct computer simulations have run into troubles when dealing with this problem due to the extremely low probability of moving a larger particle in a sea of small ones without overlapping any of them .",
    "simulations are still possible for not too dissimilar diameters , but they do not show demixing . @xcite",
    "with the help of specially designed cluster moves the first evidence of demixing has recently been found in simulations for diameter ratios smaller than 0.05 .",
    "@xcite unfortunately these cluster moves do not help above the percolation threshold , and this sets a relatively low upper bound for the total packing fraction of the fluid . besides",
    ", this method does not allow to identify the coexisting phases , so it does not distinguish fluid - fluid or fluid - solid demixing .    in order to elucidate the nature of demixing for very asymmetric mixtures",
    "the attention has shifted to understand the depletion interaction .",
    "an effective pair potential between the large spheres can be obtained by different procedures .",
    "@xcite its shape reveals a very deep and narrow ( one small - sphere diameter ) well followed by a couple of small oscillations extending two or three small - sphere diameters .",
    "the depth and the amplitude of the oscillations depend on the small spheres packing fraction . in view of the phase behaviour of spheres with narrow and deep attractive potentials @xcite fluid - fluid demixing",
    "is ruled out for sufficient asymmetry , and instead fluid - solid demixing or even expanded - dense solid demixing ( i.e.  demixing once the large component has crystallised ) should appear .",
    "simulations of a system of hs supplemented by the depletion potential @xcite confirm this conjecture if the diameter ratio is below 0.1 .",
    "expanded - dense solid demixing is indeed shown in some of this simulations for ratios 0.1 @xcite or 0.05 .",
    "@xcite this phase behaviour has been recently corroborated by _",
    "direct _ simulations of the binary mixture , @xcite which have been shown to be possible in the relevant region of the phase diagram thanks to the small amount of small spheres present in those statepoints .    in the limit of zero size of the small spheres at constant packing fraction",
    "the depletion potential becomes baxter s adhesive potential .",
    "@xcite by applying a similar limit to the fmt functional of a binary mixture of phc @xcite we have recently obtained a functional for parallel adhesive hard cubes ( pahc ) .",
    "@xcite by avoiding the singularities of this potential ( we will treat this point in detail later on ) we show that the phase behaviour of this fluid is consistent with the above described picture for the mixture of hs , with the difference that expanded - dense solid demixing is the most common scenario because pahc freezing occurs at rather low packing fractions .",
    "there are relatively few results in the literature concerning the fluid of phc . as concerns",
    "the uniform fluid the virial coefficients , both in 2d and 3d , have been exactly obtained through diagrammatic expansions up to the seventh . @xcite they have also been obtained for different approximate integral equation theories .",
    "@xcite the main consequence one draws from this information is that the virial expansion is very poorly convergent . for the 3d fluid ,",
    "the seventh order virial expansion exhibits a maximum in the pressure at @xmath0 , and then goes down very quickly to reach negative values .",
    "@xcite its behaviour at moderate densities strongly deviates from that of a sixth order virial expansion ",
    "in contrast with what happens for hs .",
    "this is the fingerprint of a nearby divergence .",
    "in fact , the simulations of the fluid of phc ( 3d ) @xcite show a continuous freezing into a simple cubic lattice at @xcite @xmath1 ( in contrast with the first order nature of the hs freezing ) .",
    "this result has been proven to be exact in infinite dimensions .",
    "@xcite the reason for a continuous freezing is the lack of rotational symmetry of this system even in the disordered phase @xcite ( thus freezing does not brakes this symmetry ) . allowing the cubes to rotate",
    "restores the first order nature of the freezing transition .",

    "( 60 ) and ( 61 ) of i , @xmath2 with @xmath3 the inverse absolute temperature in boltzmann constant units , @xmath4 the pressure , @xmath5 the number density , and @xmath6 the packing fraction , @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the cube edge - length . in fig .",

    "can be studied as usual in dft by parametrising the local density with a sum of gaussians centered at the lattice points .",

    "in i we expressed the free - energy functional of a multicomponent system with density profiles @xmath12 ( @xmath13 labeling the species ) as @xmath14 & = & f^{\\rm id}[\\{\\rho_i({\\bf r})\\}]+ f^{\\rm ex}[\\{\\rho_i({\\bf r})\\ } ] \\ , ,   \\label{ftotal }   \\\\ \\beta f^{\\rm id}[\\{\\rho_i({\\bf r})\\ } ] & = & \\sum_i\\int d{\\bf r}\\ , \\rho_i({\\bf r})\\left[\\ln{\\cal v}_i\\rho_i({\\bf r})-1\\right ]   \\ , , \\label{fideal }   \\\\ \\beta f^{\\rm ex}[\\{\\rho_i({\\bf r})\\ } ] & = & \\int d{\\bf r}\\ , \\phi(\\{n_{\\alpha}({\\bf r})\\ } )   \\ , ,   \\label{fexcess}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 the thermal volume of species @xmath13 , and @xmath16 a set of four weighted densities ( stars denotes convolution ) defined by the weights    @xmath17    [ omegas ]    with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",

    "@xcite as for the excess contribution , similar manipulations lead to @xmath38 where the last summation runs over all combinations of signs .",
    "again the latter expression is suitable for gauss - hermite integration , which is crucial this time because ( [ fnex ] ) involves a three - dimensional integration .",
    "we can now minimise with respect to @xmath11 to determine the equilibrium profile .",
    "this yields a continuous freezing at @xmath39 .",
    "as the transition is continuous we can make a more accurate determination of the transition density via a standard bifurcation analysis .",
    "this is equivalent to finding the density at which the structure factor diverges for some wavevector @xmath40 .",

    "the solution to this equation is @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is noticeable the discrepancy between the value of @xmath50 obtained from the divergence of the structure factor and that obtained using the profile ( [ densprof ] ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy can be inferred if we obtain from @xmath44 the lattice spacing , @xmath51 ; thus @xmath52 , what means that the resulting crystal has a large fraction of vacancies ( around 31% of the lattice sites ! ) .",
    "this is a strong effect that can be accounted for by simply multiplying the r.h.s .  of ( [ gxgygz ] ) by an average occupancy ratio @xmath53 and minimising with respect to this new variational parameter .",
    "in the calculation process this simply amounts to ( i ) add a term @xmath54 to the ideal free energy ( [ fnid ] ) , and ( ii ) replace @xmath55 by @xmath56 in the definition of @xmath57 [ eq .",

    "notice that @xmath32 is now given by @xmath58 . as a result",

    "compared with the simulations .",
    "it is obtained as @xmath60 .",
    "we can see that the overall agreement is good , although the freezing point is shifted down with respect to the simulations because the spt equation of state overestimates the pressure of the fluid phase .",
    "two are the requirements for a fluid mixture to be stable : @xcite ( i ) the positiveness of the specific heat at constant volume ( @xmath61 ) , and ( ii ) the positive definiteness of the matrix @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 being the helmholtz free energy , and @xmath65 the number density of species @xmath13 . condition ( i )",

    "the solution to the equation @xmath70 , if it exist at all , will represent a spinodal curve .",
    "such a condition can be understood in terms of the structure factor matrix of the mixture , given by @xmath71^{-1 } \\",

    ". then , after ( [ matrixm ] ) , @xmath70 is the condition for the structure factor to diverge at zero wavevector ( the uniform fluid ) .    in order to work out the expression of @xmath74",
    "let us introduce the following notation : @xmath75 , the packing fraction of species @xmath13 ; @xmath76 , the total packing fraction of the fluid ; @xmath77 , the large - to - small edge ratio ( @xmath78 ) ; and @xmath79 , the relative packing fraction of the large component . with these definitions as well as",

    "it follows that the 2d mixture is stable whichever the values of @xmath6 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "accordingly , parallel hard squares never demix into two _ fluids _ with different composition . equation ( [ det-3d ] ) , however , tells us that the mixture of phc will be stable provided the expression in square brackets is positive , i.e.@xmath87 since the minimum of the function @xmath88 , for @xmath89 , is 6 ( reached when @xmath90 ) and the maximum of @xmath91 , for @xmath92 , is @xmath93 ( reached when @xmath94 ) , ( [ condition ] ) will hold for _ any _ @xmath6 and @xmath86 whenever @xmath95 which means for any @xmath96 , where @xmath97 ( or , equivalently , as we have defined @xmath78 , for any @xmath98 ) . for @xmath99 there will exist values of @xmath6 and @xmath86 for which ( [ condition ] ) does not hold , and thus the mixture demixes . from ( [ condition ] )",
    "it is very simple to find that those values correspond to the region above the curve @xmath100 which therefore defines the spinodal .",
    "figure [ demix ] shows this curve for a few values of @xmath85 .",
    "it is interesting to notice the symmetry of the spinodal with respect to @xmath94 .",
    "this means that for a given packing fraction , @xmath6 , the stability of the mixture depends on the fraction of occupied volume of any of the particles , regardless their type , large or small .",
    "the existence of a spinodal instability of this type means that if the system is kept at constant pressure , there is a certain region in the density - composition phase diagram in which the fluid is stable in two coexisting phases , one rich in small particles and the other one rich in large particles . in order to determine the values of @xmath6 and @xmath86 of the two coexisting phases we must solve , at a given pressure , the equilibrium equations .",
    "if we denote @xmath101 , @xmath102 ( respectively @xmath103 , @xmath104 ) the values of the small - particle ( respectively large - particle ) rich phase , those equations can be written @xmath105 @xmath106 being the externally fixed pressure .",

    ", ,   \\label{bin - mu2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .    to determine the critical point of this transition we use the fact that this point is the only one for which the spinodal and the coexistence line coincide , and it corresponds to the minimum value of the pressure on the spinodal .",
    "hence eqs .",
    "( [ spinodal ] ) and ( [ bin - press ] ) allow us to determine this point for every value of the edge - ratio @xmath85 .",
    "the phase diagram ( fig .  [ demix ] ) shows a few features that are worth noticing .",
    "first of all , it is interesting to see that the critical line collides , when @xmath112 , with the @xmath113 edge of the phase diagram at a nonzero packing fraction .",
    "what this suggests is that in this limit the packing fraction of the small component goes to zero but it still remains a residual depletion between the large cubes .",
    "this depletion forces the one - component effective fluid of large cubes to collapse beyond a certain packing fraction .",
    "we will explore this matter in full detail in sec .  [ adhesive ] .",
    "another interesting feature of the phase diagram is the remaining impurity of the two separated phases even when the system undergoes an infinite pressure .",
    "this reflects in the fact that the coexistence lines end up at values of @xmath86 other than 1 or 0 ( pure components ) when @xmath90 ( actually , this effect is noticeable only for the values of the large - cube rich phase , although it is also present in the other phase ) .",
    "the prominent asymmetry of the coexistence line is another striking feature , but easy to understand : it arises from the enormous volume difference between large and small cubes necessary to produce demixing ( notice that demixing begins for @xmath114 , and this means that large cubes occupy a volume 1000 times larger than the small ones ) .",
    "this forces the large - cube impurities in the small - cube rich phase to be in an extremely low concentration .",
    "the wide metastability region in the small - cube rich side means that for those compositions the mixture is less sensitive to variations in composition .",
    "in order to check to which extent the demixing scenario found in the previous section holds we have to determine whether the fluids are stable against spatial modulations at the coexisting compositions .",
    "spatial inhomogeneities cause a divergence of the structure factor matrix ( [ struct ] ) at a certain nonzero wavevector .",
    "thus for a given composition , @xmath86 , the spatial instability is found as the lowest total packing fraction at which the determinant @xmath115 vanishes for at least one vector @xmath116 .",
    "we can use the expression for the dcf found in i [ eqs .",
    "( 53 ) , ( 54 ) , and ( 57 ) of i ] and simplify the problem by simply looking for instabilities along the three coordinate axes . by symmetry , this amounts to take @xmath117 .    the value of @xmath6 at which @xmath118 , as a function of @xmath86 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ solid ] for different values of @xmath85 ; these lines of instability are compared with the coexistence lines of the demixing transition ( fig .",
    "[ demix ] ) .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the critical points of the latter are always in the unstable region ; therefore , for any pair of coexisting fluids , at least one ( the large - cube rich one ) is always unstable against spatial inhomogeneities . in other words , of the two phases in which the system phase separates ,",
    "the one rich in large cubes must always be a solid .",
    "notice , on the other hand , that the other phase is also unstable for size ratios smaller than @xmath119 .",
    "one is then tempted to conclude that fluid - fluid demixing is preempted by freezing in this system .",
    "however coexistence between a large - cube rich solid phase and a small - cube rich fluid phase may change drastically the compositions of the coexisting phases and thus make a fluid - solid demixing more stable than just a freezing of the whole system .",
    "the only conclusion we can draw from fig .  [ solid ] is that the fluid - fluid demixing transition found in sec .",
    "[ stability ] is always metastable .",
    "in order to study the phase behaviour of a very asymmetric binary mixture let us first consider the effect on the interaction of the big particles induced by the small ones ( depletion ) . to this purpose",
    "let us use a semi - grand ensemble in which the small particles ( solvent ) are kept at constant chemical potential .",
    "this is the usual experimental setup in colloidal suspensions . in this situation",
    "the element of the structure - factor matrix ( [ struct ] ) corresponding to the correlations between large particles can be considered as the structure factor of an equivalent one - component fluid made of the large particles interacting via the effective potential induced by the solvent .",

    "this particular choice has two important advantages ( they will be made clear below ) : ( i ) the free energy of the fluid phase is the same as that of the monodisperse system ( hence its phase behaviour as well ) , and ( ii ) formally the expressions for the free energy of the solid phase change very little .",
    "it also has two drawbacks : ( i ) particles are not cubic anymore , and ( ii ) there is a nonzero contribution in the negative lengths . as these two inconvenients disappear when @xmath254 they can be overcome by choosing @xmath255 .",

    "the singular behaviour of the monodisperse system is removed , and we can readily determine phase equilibria . a typical result for a small value of @xmath253 is shown in fig .  [ poly ] .",
    "this figure reveals several remarkable features .",

    "appears after a continuous transition from the fluid phase ( f ) . the expanded solid ( s@xmath274)-dense solid ( s@xmath275 ) transition ends at a critical point , @xmath276 , below which we can only find a fluid and a single solid , separated by a continuous transition .",
    "thirdly , as @xmath196 increases from @xmath276 the expanded solid packing fraction decreases down to meeting the freezing packing fraction . above the point where this occurs",
    "coexistence is between a fluid and a dense solid ( s@xmath275 ) , the former quickly becoming highly diluted and the latter highly packed .",
    "notice the strong resemblance between this true equilibrium phase behaviour and the metastable behaviour described to occur the monodisperse pahc fluid ( sec .",

    "the fluid of phc is a rather academic one which however has the great advantage of being analytically tractable in contexts where the fluid of hs is not , thanks to its adequacy to a fundamental measure description . yet , with some peculiarities due to the lack of rotational symmetry , @xcite the physics it reveals is similar to that of more realistic fluids .",
    "it then allows for theoretical investigation on fluid phase behaviour otherwise very difficult ( the closely related fluid of parallel hard parallelepipeds has been recently used in the context of associating fluids @xcite and liquid crystals @xcite ) .",
    "the main contribution of the fluid of phc is to the understanding of the phase diagram of a binary mixture .",

    "@xcite however , as it has been shown in this work , this feature is irrelevant when the effect of depletion in the solid phase is accounted for",
    ". spatial order of the large component strongly enhances demixing , so that fluid - solid demixing becomes the main scenario of the phase diagram of binary mixtures . but this transition can be preempted by the freezing of the large component , and when this happens the system phase separates into two fcc solids with a different lattice parameter .",
    "this effect , very clearly shown here for the mixture of phc ( in the limit of infinite asymmetry ) , has also been confirmed in simulations of hs interacting via an effective depletion potential , @xcite and very recently also in direct simulations on the true binary mixture .",
    "@xcite the simulations also show that the solid - solid transition disappears as the asymmetry of the two components decreases , but it is anyhow categoric with respect to the fluid - solid nature of demixing .",

    "<S> a previously developed fundamental measure functional [ , 6379 ( 1997 ) ] is used to study the phase behaviour of a system of parallel hard cubes . </S>",
    "<S> the single - component fluid exhibits a continuous transition to a solid with an anomalously large density of vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the binary mixture has a demixing transition for edge - length ratios below 0.1 . </S>",
    "<S> freezing in this mixture reveals that at least the phase rich in large cubes always lies in the region where the uniform fluid is unstable , hence suggesting a fluid - solid phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> a method is developed to study very asymmetric binary mixtures by taking the limit of zero size ratio ( scaling density and fugacity of the solvent as appropriate ) in the semi - grand ensemble where the chemical potential of the solvent is fixed . with this procedure the mixture is exactly mapped onto a one - component fluid of parallel adhesive hard cubes . at any density and solvent fugacity </S>",
    "<S> the large cubes are shown to collapse into a close - packed solid . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the phase diagram contains a large metastability region with fluid and solid phases . upon introduction of a slight polydispersity in the large cubes </S>",
    "<S> the system shows the typical phase diagram of a fluid with an isostructural solid - solid transition ( with the exception of a continuous freezing ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequences about the phase behaviour of binary mixtures of hard core particles are then drawn .    2 </S>"
