    "x - ray and gamma - ray spectra of accreting black holes and neutron stars are deconvolved into ( at least ) two components : a soft component interpreted as emission from an optically thick accretion disc , and a hard tail associated with a hot ( 10100 kev ) `` corona '' .",

    "( 2000 ) .",
    "an amusing fact is that super - massive black holes in agn , gbhs and accreting neutron stars in their hard ( low ) states ( see tanaka & lewin 1995 ; gilfanov et al .",
    "1995 for the definition of the spectral states ) show very similar x/@xmath0-ray spectra ( see zdziarski 1999 ; barret et al .",
    "furthermore , properties of their rapid temporal variability are also similar ( van der klis 1995b ; wijnands & van der klis 1999 ; psaltis , belloni & van der klis 1999 ; ford et al . 1999 ; edelson & nandra 1999 ; chiang et al . 2000 ) .",
    "all this argues for a common mechanism of the x - ray production in all these sources .",
    "there are good reasons to believe that the main radiative mechanism for the production of the hard x - rays is comptonization of soft photons ( e.g. , shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ; sunyaev & trmper 1979 ; sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) . however , it is not completely clear what determines the observed spectral slopes .",
    "the geometry of the x - ray emitting region and the source of soft photons is still a matter of debate ( see svensson 1996 ; poutanen 1998 ; beloborodov 1999b ; wardzinski & zdziarski 2000 ) .",
    "an important clue to our understanding of the x - ray production came from the discovery of fe lines ( at @xmath1 kev ) and the hardening of the spectra above 10 kev in agn ( pounds et al . 1990 ; mushotzky , done , & pounds 1993 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) , cygnus x-1 ( e.g. , done et al . 1992 ; gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) , and neutron stars ( e.g. , yoshida et al .",
    "these features are associated with the reflection of hard x - rays from cold material ( basko , sunyaev , & titarchuk 1974 ; george & fabian 1991 ; magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ; poutanen , nagendra , & svensson 1996 ) .",
    "these observations gave support to the so called two - phase accretion disc - corona models .",
    "in such models , x - rays are emitted by a hot rarified corona above the cold accretion disc ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ; haardt , maraschi , & ghisellini 1994 ; stern et al .",
    "1995 ; poutanen & svensson 1996 ) .",
    "hard x - rays from the corona , being reprocessed in the cold disc , produce the reflection hump as well as most of the seed soft photons that are subsequently comptonized to produce the hard x - rays .",
    "this is the _ feedback _ mechanism .",
    "the geometry of the corona determines the feedback factor which in its turn determines the spectral slope of the escaping radiation .",
    "the temperature of the emitting plasma ( or to be more exact , the kompaneets @xmath2-parameter ) is determined by the energy balance between heating ( by magnetic reconnection ? ) and cooling ( by comptonization of soft photons ) .",
    "further support for the feedback models was recently given by zdziarski , lubinski , & smith ( 1999 ) ( see also zdziarski 1999 ; gilfanov , churazov , & revnivtsev 2000 ) who found a correlation between the amount of reflection ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a solid angle subtended by cold material as viewed from the x - ray source ) and the intrinsic photon spectral index , @xmath5 , of the hard x - ray component . such a correlation can easily be explained if there is overlap between the hot corona and the cold disc ( poutanen , krolik , & ryde 1997 ) .",
    "the further the cold disc penetrates into the corona , the larger is the cooling , the smaller is the temperature of the corona , the softer is the spectrum , and , finally , the larger is the amplitude of the reflection .",
    "the model , however , appears to have trouble giving reflection amplitudes above @xmath6 ( if the coronal optical depth @xmath7 , see zdziarski et al .",
    "1997 ) due to partial smearing of the reflection component by the hot corona .",
    "alternatively , the observed @xmath8 correlation can be reproduced by variations of the bulk velocity of the x/@xmath0-ray emitting plasma ( beloborodov 1999a , b ) .",
    "if the emitting regions are sufficiently compact to produce electron - positron pairs , the pressure of the radiation reflected and reprocessed in the disc accelerates pairs to mildly relativistic velocities away from the disc . on the other hand , for proton dominated plasmas , a small anisotropy in the energy dissipation mechanism can result in the ejection of particles away or towards the disc .",
    "ejection away from the disc reduces @xmath9 below 1 and leads to hard spectra , while ejection towards to the disc can result in apparent @xmath10 as is observed in some objects .",
    "the physical possibility of the corona formation was studied by galeev , rosner , & vaiana ( 1979 ) .",
    "they showed that the magnetic fields , being amplified in the cold disc due to turbulent motions and differential rotation , do not have time to annihilate inside the disc on the inflow time scale .",
    "instead , the field loops are expelled from the disc by buoyancy ( the parker instability ) and they annihilate in the tenuous corona .",
    "beloborodov ( 1999a ) showed that the mechanism studied by galeev et al . is able to produce a corona of limited luminosity which is @xmath11 ( the ratio of the disc height to its radius ) times smaller than the disc luminosity .",
    "by contrast , in some sources most of the energy escapes in the form of hard x - rays .",
    "beloborodov also argued that the magneto - rotational instability ( velikhov 1959 ; chandrasekhar 1960 ; balbus & hawley 1991 ) increases the rate of the magnetic field generation ( as compared with the galeev et al .",
    "model ) thus producing an active magnetic corona where a large fraction of the gravitational energy can finally be dissipated in magnetic flares .",
    "these qualitative arguments were recently supported by numerical three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of miller & stone ( 2000 ) who showed that about 25 % of the total energy dissipation can occur in the rarified corona .",
    "an alternative to the magnetic corona is the hot disc model ( shapiro et al .",
    "1976 ; ichimaru 1977 ; narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998 ; zdziarski 1998 ; esin et al . 1998 ) which is also able to explain the observed x/@xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "in order to distinguish between the models , it would be helpful to compare the predictions of different models with the temporal variability data ( see van der klis 1995a , b and cui 1999a for recent reviews ) .",
    "unfortunately , most of the papers on the spectral models do not consider the temporal variability . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the models designed to explain the temporal variability data do not pay enough attention to the emission processes and the physics of the spectral formation .    in this review",
    ", we will discuss the variability data keeping in mind recent advances in modelling broad - band x/@xmath0-ray spectra of accreting black holes and neutron stars .",
    "most attention will be paid to the time lags that can shed light on the mechanism of the x - ray production .",
    "then we discuss simple phenomenological models that are able to explain some of the observational facts .",
    "after that , we switch to the physical models . in particular , the properties of the comptonizing regions will be discussed .",
    "we will point out the flaws in models that do not consider the energy balance in the `` compton cloud '' , and then discuss models that satisfy the energy conservation law and confront them with the available data .",
    "the standard temporal characteristics that are usually computed are the power - density spectra ( pds ) in different energy channels , auto / cross - correlation functions ( acf / ccf ) , the time / phase lags between the variability in different energy channels , the coherence function , etc .",
    "time lags have been studied by two methods , by constructing the ccf and by cross - spectral analysis ( for details , see lewin et al .",
    "1988 ; van der klis 1989 ; nowak et al .",
    "1999a ) .      the observations of cygnus x-1 from sounding rockets and _ heao 1 _ ( priedhorsky et al .",
    "1979 ; nolan et al .",
    "1981 ) showed that the ccf between different energy channels peaks very close to zero lag ( delay @xmath12 ms ) , but it is slightly asymmetric .",
    "similar asymmetry was found in the _ exosat _ data by page ( 1985 ) who claimed a @xmath13 ms shift of the peak of the ccf between the 5 - 14 kev and the 2 - 5 kev bands .",
    "recent  observations clearly show asymmetries of the ccfs , which , however , peak within @xmath14  ms from zero lag ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ccfcygx1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the relation between the variation in the two bands are not simply a time delay .",
    "asymmetry is also observed in the  data of gx 339 - 4 , where the ccfs are offset by @xmath15  ms from zero ( using the 2 - 5 and 10 - 40 kev bands , smith & liang 1999 ) .",
    "the ccfs of agn also display similar properties ( e.g. , papadakis & lawrence 1995 ; lee et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the ccfs can not be fitted with simple exponentials at any time scale .",
    "a reasonably good description of the ccf is in terms of a stretched exponential @xmath16 $ ] ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : ccfcygx1 ] ) , where the normalisation @xmath17 , the time where the ccfs peak @xmath18  s , @xmath19 in the range @xmath20  s , and the time constant @xmath21 is different for rising and decaying part of the ccf .",
    "such a behaviour is probably the result of self - similarity of the light curve .",
    "it is interesting to note that the acf of gamma - ray bursts also show a similar stretched exponential behaviour ( see stern & svensson 1996 ; beloborodov 1999c ) .    since the ccf does not show which frequencies contribute most to the observed lags , van der klis et al .",

    "different mechanisms should be involved in producing the lags at different fourier frequencies , the lags in the qpos and the coherent pulsations , and the lags in the broad - band noise .",
    "let us first consider the simplest possible model that produces time lags : a shot noise model ( terrell 1972 ) , where shots ( = flares ) are uncorrelated with each other .",
    "we assume that the shot time profiles at different energies have the same shape , but slightly different time constants . as an example we take",
    "a shot profile at soft energies @xmath41^p      \\exp[-t/\\tau]$ ] and at hard energies @xmath42^p   \\exp[-t/(\\eta\\tau)]$ ] , where @xmath43 is measured from the beginning of the shot and @xmath44 is positive .",

    "the lag is positive when hard photons are lagging soft ones ( i.e. , for @xmath57 ) . for small frequencies ,",
    "@xmath58 rises as @xmath59 , while for large frequencies , it decays as @xmath60 .",
    "the lag reaches a maximum of @xmath61 at @xmath62 close to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the frequencies where @xmath65 peak .",
    "one can also consider a modified shot noise model , where the shot time scales are distributed according to a power law , @xmath66 between @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( see , e.g. , miyamoto & kitamoto 1989 ; lochner , swank , & szymkowiak 1991 ) , with the same ratio @xmath69 .",
    "physically this could correspond to , for example , the situation when flares of different durations appear at different radii from the central object ( poutanen & fabian 1999a ) .",
    "a power - law distribution of @xmath21 assures that the pds is also a power - law @xmath70 ( lochner et al .",
    "if the flares are self - similar , then the phase lag will be constant @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , decay as @xmath74 at @xmath75 and rise linearly at @xmath76 .",
    "the corresponding time lags are constant , @xmath77 , for @xmath76 , and decay approximately as @xmath74 between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "note that in this model the coherence function ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ; nowak et al .",
    "1999a ) is close to unity , since the light curves at different energies are almost perfectly synchronised .    if we assume that @xmath80 , there are hard lags and the predicted behaviour of the time lags and coherence function is in a very good agreement with the observations of gbhs ( poutanen & fabian 1999a ) .",
    "however , this model contradicts the ccf of cyg x-1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ccfcygx1 ] and maccarone et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the ccf becomes narrower at larger energies which requires the shots to be narrower at larger energies .",
    "if one , however , reverses the time profiles of the shots , so that they rise slower and decay faster ( e.g. , @xmath81 ) , and one assumes @xmath82 ( i.e. , hard shots are narrower ) , the ccfs and the time lags can be reproduced , simultaneously .",
    "much more complicated models which also account for lags in the qpos sources were developed by shibazaki et al .",
    "we just note here that if a signal consists of shots appearing almost periodically and if shots at different energies are shifted in time one against another ( or , e.g. , the minima are reached at the same time and the peaks are not ) , the phase lag has a very complicated dependency on frequency ( e.g. , changes sign from one harmonic to another ) depending on the shot profiles .",
    "since comptonization is the most probable mechanism for x - ray production in compact objects , it is natural to attribute the time delays between hard and soft photons to this process .",
    "hard photons are the result of more scattering and so emerge after , or lag behind , softer ones .",

    "this model was criticised by miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and vaughan et al .",
    "first , the large size of the cloud ( @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath100 ) is needed to produce large delays observed in gbhs and neutron stars .",
    "such cloud is physically unrealistic , since most of the gravitational energy is dissipated within @xmath101 .",
    "second , the lags predicted by the model are independent of the fourier frequency ( miyamoto et al . 1988 ) contrary to the observed @xmath102 dependence .",
    "third , it is assumed that the soft photons produce the variability , while the hot cloud is not variable .",
    "observationally , it is well established that when a soft black body spectrum is observed in gbhs it is much _ less _ variable than the hard x - rays ( e.g. miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ) , so that the hard x - ray variability is most probably intrinsic to the hot cloud itself .    finally , we would like to point out that due to the requirement of energy conservation the whole concept of a static compton cloud with a constant temperature is physically unrealistic .",
    "the total emitted x - ray luminosity ( produced by comptonization of soft radiation ) is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the heating rate in the hot cloud and @xmath105 is the luminosity of seed soft photons . for hard spectra ( i.e. @xmath106 ) ,",
    "the total x - ray luminosity is thus a function of the heating rate _ only _ and it does not depend on the amount of seed soft photons . by changing @xmath105 , one effectively changes the spectral slope of the emergent x - ray radiation which is a function of the compton amplification factor @xmath108 .",
    "this results in the pivoting of the spectrum ( see poutanen 1998 ; beloborodov 1999b ) without a noticeable increase in @xmath109 .",
    "the larger the @xmath105 , the smaller the equilibrium temperature of the emitting electrons , and the softer the spectrum .",
    "by contrast , in static compton cloud models no changes in the electron temperature are considered in reaction to the changes in the number of soft photons , violating thus the energy conservation law . in order to increase the emitted luminosity",
    ", one has to change the energy dissipation rate in the cloud , but then exactly these changes will be driving the variability .",
    "recently , kazanas , hua , & titarchuk ( 1997 ) ( see also bttcher & liang 1998 ; hua , kazanas , & cui 1999 ) modified the comptonization model . instead of a homogeneous compton cloud , the density profile , @xmath110 ,",
    "was assumed ( in this case , one has equal optical depth per logarithm of radius ) .",
    "the variability is still driven by changing the rate of soft photon injection in the center of the cloud .",
    "then larger radii produce lower frequency variability ( filtering out high frequency signal ) and larger lags , while the smaller radii produce higher frequency variability and smaller lags ( see also nowak et al .",
    "1999a , c ) .",
    "this model solves only one of the problem mentioned above ( @xmath74 time lag dependence ) , while the other problems remain unsolved .",
    "another modification of the model was considered by bttcher & liang ( 1999 ) based on an earlier suggestion by miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . here",
    ", small cold clouds are assumed to free - fall into the hot central cloud thus changing the input of soft photons .",
    "again , this model has problems with energy conservation .",
    "miyamoto et al . (",
    "1988 ) pointed out that some modulation mechanism must be invoked to produce the strongly frequency - dependent time lags .",
    "poutanen & fabian ( 1999a , b ) proposed a model where the time lags are produced by the evolution of the flare spectrum .",
    "they assumed that the energy dissipation varies in time .",
    "for a small ( of the order of @xmath99 ) emitting region ( er ) one can consider the spectral evolution as a sequence of steady - states as long as the characteristic time scale of variability is @xmath111 .",
    "any changes in the amplification factor @xmath112 would cause spectral variability and , specifically , a continuous increase of @xmath112 with time during the course of the flare would cause a soft - to - hard spectral evolution producing hard time lags of the order of the flare time scale ( see   [ sec : shot ] ) .",
    "poutanen & fabian ( 1999b ) considered three mechanisms that can increase @xmath112 .",
    "+ ( 1 ) a flare starts in the background of soft photons .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is soft as long as @xmath113 . with increasing @xmath104 ,",
    "the soft photon input gets dominated by reprocessed photons . the spectral slope is then determined by the feedback parameter @xmath114 ( the fraction of @xmath104 returned to the er after the reprocessing in the disc into soft seed photons , see stern et al .",
    "1995 ; svensson 1996 ; beloborodov 1999b ) and the spectrum becomes hard .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the dissipation is accompanied by pumping net momentum into the hot plasma of the emission region ( beloborodov 1999a , b ) .",
    "the resulting bulk velocity increases with increasing luminosity .",
    "it leads to a lower feedback and higher @xmath112 ( if the velocity is directed away from the disc ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the differential rotation of the footpoints of a magnetic loop at the disc surface causes a twisting and elevation of the loop ( romanova et al .",
    "the time scale of the evolution is of the order of the keplerian time - scale .",
    "when the emission region moves away from the disc , the feedback decreases and @xmath112 increases ( see fig .  [ fig : flare ] ) .",
    "in all these cases the spectral evolution proceeds from soft to hard .",
    "the _ hard _ time lags between energies @xmath115 and @xmath85 are @xmath116 . if there is a distribution of time scales @xmath21 between , say , 1  ms and 0.3  s ( e.g. , keplerian time scales at the radii between the innermost radius of the accretion disc and @xmath117 ) , the time lags @xmath118 at the characteristic frequencies of the variability ( see   [ sec : shot ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cygx1lags ] ) .",
    "if @xmath119 a few light crossing time of the er , the spectrum in the beginning of the flare is hard because of photon starvation ( one needs a few @xmath120 to get reprocessed soft photons into the er ) and softens towards the end of the flare ( poutanen & fabian 1999a ; malzac & jourdain 2000 ) producing _ soft _ time lags . observing the change of sign of the time lags at some fourier frequency , @xmath121 , would determine the size of the er that produces variability at these frequencies ( e.g. , for cyg x-1 , @xmath122  hz@xmath123 ) .",
    "the models considered above can explain the time lags in the broad - band noise .",
    "in some qpo sources the time lags show a very complicated behaviour ( see   [ sec : lags ] ) and may require different explanation . in radiation - hydrodynamic model",
    "( see , e.g. , lamb 1989 ; miller & lamb 1992 ) , qpos appear as a result of oscillations in the optical depth of the radial flow due to the radiation feedback from the neutron star surface .",
    "the resulting spectral pivoting produces phase lags and the increase of the rms amplitude variability above the pivoting point .",
    "this model , however , is not applicable to the qpos and the lags in black holes sources ( see , e.g. , takizawa et al .",
    "1997 ) because of the absence of a hard surface .",
    "the galactic microquasar grs  1915 + 105 shows large amplitude oscillations with periods varying from @xmath1241 up to 100 s. these time scales are a few orders of magnitudes larger than keplerian time scales and up to @xmath125 time larger than the light crossing time of the er . the best candidate for producing the spectral variability that causes the lags in grs  1915 + 105 is the oscillation of the inner radius of the cold disc on viscous time scales .",
    "such oscillations are similar to the spectral transitions , but have smaller amplitude and occur at shorter time scales .",
    "changes of the relative geometry of the hot corona and the cold disc ( with or without changes of the total luminosity ) cause spectral pivoting at a few kev ( see , e.g. , poutanen , krolik , & ryde 1997 ; esin et al .",
    "the fluxes below and above the pivot point oscillate then with a phase shift of @xmath126 .",
    "the rms amplitude of the qpo increases with the energy .",
    "the phase lags between the energies above the pivot point can then be produced if the oscillations are time asymmetric ( see fig .  11 in morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ; vilhu & nevalainen 1998 ) .",
    "similar ( but aperiodic ) changes in the inner disc radius can be responsible for the broad - band variability observed at @xmath127  hz in , e.g. , cyg x-1",
    ". associated spectral changes can manifest themselves in time lags observed at these frequencies .",
    "the spectra of accreting gbhs and neutron stars show signatures of compton reflection ( see   [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "some fraction of the x - ray photons can be reflected from the outer edge of a flared accretion disc , a wind from the companion , etc .",
    "such a reflector acts as a low pass filter smearing out the high frequency variations and produces lags corresponding to the light travel time to the reflector only at lower frequencies .",
    "such processes can explain the break in the time lag spectra observed in cyg  x-1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cygx1lags ] ) and in other gbhs at @xmath128 hz .",
    "reprocessed soft radiation which accompanies compton reflection is emitted in the optical and uv spectral bands if the reprocessing occurs far away from the central x - ray source .",
    "the time delays can then be measured between the optical / uv and the x - ray radiation ( e.g. , hynes et al .",
    "on the other hand , reprocessing in the vicinity of the x - ray emitting region , produces time delays of the order of the time scale of the spectral evolution in the hard x - ray band .",
    "this may be one reason for the observed soft lags in the soft state of gx 339 - 4 and gs 1124 - 68 (   [ sec : lagbh ] ) .",
    "some neutron star sources show lags in their periodic oscillations at khz frequencies .",
    "ford et al . ( 1999 ) and ford ( 2000 ) interpreted the soft lags in aquila  x-1 and in the accreting millisecond pulsar sax 1808.4 - 3658 using a model of a rotating hot spot with a black body spectrum at the surface of a neutron star where the lags appear due to doppler effects .",
    "the weak energy dependence of the rms amplitude of the oscillations reported by cui et al .",
    "( 1998 ) rules out the black body model for the spectrum used by ford .",
    "detailed analysis of the pulsations in the time domain by folding techniques by revnivtsev ( 1999 ) revealed that the pulse profile is distorted at different energies , while the minima are reached at the same time ( i.e. , there are _ no _ lags in the normal meaning of this word ) .",
    "time lags and other temporal variability data provide strong constraints on the models of the x - ray production .",
    "it was demonstrated that static compton cloud models are based on physically unrealistic assumptions .",
    "the models invoking spectral evolution of the flare spectrum can fit both the ccf and the time lag fourier spectra only if ( 1 ) the energy dissipation rate increases slowly and decreases rapidly and ( 2 ) the flare spectrum evolves from soft to hard . if soft seed photons are produced by reprocessing the hard ones , the change of sign in the time lag spectrum is expected at high frequencies corresponding to the light crossing time of the emission region .",
    "the absence of such a change would put constraints on the size of the emitting region .",
    "we also argued that the reflection of hard x - rays from the outer part of the accretion disc produces time delays that we already might have observed in gbhs .",
    "if so , the disc should be flared and the break in the time lag fourier spectra then corresponds to the size of the accretion disc .",
    "of course , such an interpretation is not unique .",
    "alternatively , small scale spectral transitions ( e.g. , oscillations of the inner radius of the accretion disc at viscous time scales ) might produce time lags observed at lower frequencies .    in the case of ( quasi- ) periodic oscillations from the neutron star sources , we argued that in order to reproduce both the time lags and the energy dependent rms amplitude , the spectrum of the hot spots should not be close to a black - body .",
    "this work was supported by the swedish natural science research council and the anna - greta and holger crafoord fund .",
    "i thank katja pottschmidt for providing the time lag fourier spectra and the light curves of cyg x-1 used in the calculations of the cross - correlation functions .",
    "i am grateful to andrei beloborodov and roland svensson for valuable comments ."
