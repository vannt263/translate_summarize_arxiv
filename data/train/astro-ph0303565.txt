    "brown dwarfs , which straddle the mass range between stars and planets , appear to be common both in the field and in star - forming regions . their ubiquity makes the question of their origin an important one , both for our understanding of brown dwarfs themselves as well as for theories on the formation of stars and planets .    in the standard framework , a low - mass star forms out of a collapsing cloud fragment , and goes through a `` t tauri phase '' , during which it accretes material from a surrounding disk , before arriving on the main sequence",
    "there is ample observational evidence now to support many key aspects of this picture for young solar - mass stars .",
    "one of the defining characteristics of the t tauri phase is a rich array of emission lines in the spectra , of which h@xmath0 is usually the most prominent ( joy 1945 ) .",
    "the broad , asymmetric h@xmath0 line profiles , seen in `` classical '' t tauri stars , are now thought to arise in the infall region , as are many of the metallic emission lines ( muzerolle , hartmann & calvet 1998 and references therein ) .    whether the same scenario holds for objects at and below the sub - stellar limit is an open question .",
    "it has been suggested , most recently by padoan & nordlund ( 2003 ) , that brown dwarfs form in the same way as more massive stars , via ` turbulent fragmentation ' .",
    "reipurth & clarke ( 2001 ) proposed an alternate scenario , which has been further explored through numerical simulations by bate et al .",
    "( 2002 ; 2003 ) : in their model , brown dwarfs ( and presumably isolated planetary mass objects or `` planemos '' ) are stellar embryos , ejected from newborn multiple systems before they can accrete sufficient mass to eventually fuse hydrogen . in this scenario ,",
    "a stellar embryo competes with its siblings in order to accrete infalling matter , and the one that grows slowest is most likely to be ejected through dynamical interactions .",
    "a key prediction of reipurth & clarke ( 2001 ) is that `` sub - stellar equivalents to the classical t tauri stars should be rather short - lived '' because the ejection process limits the amount of gas brought along in a disk .",
    "studies of _ young _ sub - stellar objects could provide valuable clues to distinguish between these formation mechanisms .",
    "therefore , we have undertaken a multi - faceted study of very low mass ( vlm ) objects in star - forming regions and their immediate circumstellar environment .",
    "one of our key goals is to investigate whether some or all young brown dwarfs undergo a t tauri - like phase , and if so how long that phase lasts .",
    "this paper reports on a search for accretion signatures in high - resolution spectra of 14 objects near and below the sub - stellar boundary in ic 348 ( @xmath1 320 pc ) and taurus ( @xmath1 150 pc ) .",
    "our targets consist of m5m8 sources in ic 348 from luhman ( 1999 ) and the recently identified m7m8 brown dwarfs in taurus from martn et al .",
    "combined with the spectra of 15 additional sources in the upper scorpius and @xmath2 ophiuchus star - forming regions ( jayawardhana , mohanty & basri 2002 ) , we now have a substantial sample to characterize disk accretion in young brown dwarfs .    in a subsequent paper",
    ", we will use these optical spectra to derive temperatures , gravities and masses for the current sample , as we did for upper sco and @xmath2 oph ( mohanty et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "for now , we assume an age of @xmath1 12 myr for ic 348 ( luhman et al . 2000 ) and @xmath1 3 myr for taurus ( white & ghez 2001 ) .",
    "if we further adopt the luhman ( 1999 ) spectral type - temperature scale for low - mass pre - main sequence objects , then theoretical evolutionary models ( baraffe et al . 1998 ) imply masses of @xmath1 0.1 ",
    "0.02 @xmath3   for our m5-m8 objects .",
    "thus , our sample spans a mass range from the stellar / sub - stellar boundary well into the brown dwarf domain ( and possibly even into the planetary mass regime ; mohanty et al .",
    "we obtained optical spectra of the target sample using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) on the keck i telescope on 2001 october 27 ut ( cfht - bd - tau-2 , 3 and 4 ) and on 2002 october 31 ut ( the rest , plus a second spectrum of cfht-3 ) . with the 1.15  slit ,",
    "the two - pixel - binned spectral resolution is r @xmath4 33,000 .",
    "the instrument yielded 15 spectral orders in the 6390  8700    wavelength range , with gaps between the orders , providing a variety of features related to youth and accretion activity .",
    "for comparison to our targets and to derive _",
    "v  sin  i _ , we used m dwarf and m giant spectroscopic standards observed with the same hires set up .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner using idl routines , as described in basri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we derived rotational velocities ( @xmath5  sin  @xmath6 ) of the targets by cross - correlating with a ` spun - up ' template of a slowly rotating standard .",
    "multiple spectral orders ( @xmath1 6 ) , selected on the basis of an absence of strong telluric features , strong gravity - sensitive features , and stellar emission lines , were used in the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "following white & basri ( 2003 ) , we used a combination of giant and dwarf spectra for the template ( see detailed discussion in mohanty & basri 2003 and mohanty et al .",
    "table 1 lists the derived @xmath5  sin  @xmath6 , h@xmath0 equivalent widths , and h@xmath0 full widths at 10% of the peak flux for our sample .",
    "figure 1 shows h@xmath0 line profiles in our sample .",
    "of the ten ic 348 objects , five show broad , asymmetric h@xmath0 lines ; three of those five also exhibit strong emission in oi ( 8446 ) and caii ( 8662 ) ( fig .",
    "2 ) . of the four taurus targets ,",
    "cfht - bd - tau-3 and cfht - bd - tau-4 show very strong but relatively narrow h@xmath0 .",
    "we have clear detections of li ( 6708  ) absorption in ic348 - 256 , 286 and 353 , and marginal detections in cfht - bd - tau-2 and 3 .",
    "the other spectra are too noisy in this region for unambiguous detection ( not surprising for these very faint , red objects ) .      the shape and width of the h@xmath0 emission profile is commonly used to discriminate between accretors and non - accretors among t tauri stars ( tts ) .",
    "stars exhibiting broad , asymmetric h@xmath0 lines with equivalent width larger than 10    are generally categorized as classical tts ( ctts ) , although this threshold value varies with spectral type ( e.g. , martn 1998 ) .",
    "recently white & basri ( 2003 ; hereafter wb ) have suggested that a full - width @xmath7 270 kms@xmath8 , at 10% of the peak emission , is a better empirical indicator of accretion , independent of spectral type .    by the latter criterion ,",
    "two of our targets are accretors : ic348 - 165 ( m5.25 ) and ic348 - 205 ( m6 ) , with 10% full - width @xmath7 300 kms@xmath8 .",
    "moreover , both objects show broad ( fwhm @xmath7 100 kms@xmath8 ) emission in oi ( 8446 ) and caii ( 8662 ) ; ic348 - 165 also exhibits broad emission in hei ( 6678 ) . in ctts , the presence of a broad component in these metallic emission lines is associated with moderate to high accretion rates ( @xmath9@xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12/yr ) , such as in dg tau and dr tau ( hessman & guenther 1997 ) .",
    "wb detected these lines in cida-1 ( m5.5 ) and gm tau ( m6.5 ) , two taurus objects at the sub - stellar boundary that also exhibit broad h@xmath0 profiles and veiling , and inferred accretion rates ( @xmath1 10@xmath13 m@xmath12/yr ) similar to ctts . in fact , muzerolle , hartmann , & calvet ( 1998 ; hereafter mhc ) found a correlation between the accretion rates and the line fluxes in caii , oi and hei for their sample of ctts , and argued that the broad components of these lines originate in magnetospheric infall regions .",
    "mhc also found that the oi ( 8446 ) line appears in emission only for those ctts with accretion rates higher than a certain threshold value ( @xmath1 10@xmath11 m@xmath12/yr ) .",
    "thus , our detection of broad oi and caii emission in ic348 - 165 and ic348 - 205 ( as well as broad hei in the former ) is significant , and implies that some vlm objects are accreting in a fashion analogous to ctts .",
    "we also find broad oi and caii emission in a third object , ic348 - 415 ( m6.5 ) ( fig.2 ) . the results of mhc quoted above then indicate that accretion is very likely in this object as well .",
    "it is thus noteworthy that its h@xmath0 10% full -width ( @xmath1 213 kms@xmath8 ) is somewhat below the accretion cutoff ( 270 kms@xmath8 ) defined by wb .",
    "we suggest that the latter cutoff may need revision for vlm objects , for the following reason",
    ". the broad component of the h@xmath0 line is believed to arise in a nearly free - falling flow between the inner edge of the disk and the stellar surface ( e.g. , hartmann , hewett , & calvet 1994 ) ; the lower limit on the line - broadening is then set by the free - fall velocity ( @xmath14 ) . for ages 13 myr and substellar masses ( @xmath15 @xmath16 0.08 m@xmath12 ) , evolutionary models ( baraffe et al . 1998 ) yield @xmath14 @xmath1 75125 kms@xmath8 , implying h@xmath0 full - widths of order 150250 kms@xmath8 , significantly less than the wb cutoff of @xmath1 270 kms@xmath8 .",
    "muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue that stark broadening can increase the h@xmath0 width beyond that expected from infall alone .",
    "however , this effect does not appear important at rates below @xmath1 10@xmath17 m@xmath12/yr ; thus in mildly accreting brown dwarfs , the h@xmath0 line - width is likely to be set by @xmath14 alone .",
    "for instance , in v410 anon 13 ( a taurus m6 object with @xmath9@xmath1 5@xmath1810@xmath19 m@xmath12/yr ) , muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) adequately model h@xmath0 with no recourse to stark broadening .",
    "these authors also show that accretion rates @xmath16 10@xmath17 m@xmath12/yr are not expected to produce any optical veiling arising from the accretion shock .",
    "the wb cutoff , however , is _ defined _ in terms of optical veiling : only objects with veiling are adopted as accretors , and it is these that have h@xmath0 full - widths @xmath7 270 kms@xmath8 .",
    "our foregoing discussion suggests that vlm objects with very low accretion rates can fail the wb accretion test : their h@xmath0 profiles are unlikely to be stark - broadened beyond the @xmath14 full - widths , which are less than 270 kms@xmath8 ; furthermore , they will also not exhibit any veiling indicative of accretion . a case in point",
    "is v410 anon 13 itself : its h@xmath0 10% full - width is @xmath1 250 kms@xmath8 ( slightly below the wb limit ) , and it shows no veiling ( and no caii or oi emission either ) , yet is an accretor .",
    "similarly ic348 - 415 , which does show caii and oi but has an h@xmath0 full - width somewhat below the wb limit , is very likely to be accreting .",
    "consequently , we adopt a 10% full - width @xmath1 200 kms@xmath8 as our accretion cutoff . given the rotational velocities in our sample ( all @xmath5  sin  @xmath6 @xmath20 50kms@xmath8 ) , such a width is hard to explain by rotational broadening and/or flaring , but is in agreement with the expected @xmath14 . in that case , at least two other targets in our sample  ic348 - 382 ( m5.5 ) and ic348 - 355 ( m8 )  are accretors as well , albeit with low accretion rates .",
    "both show broad asymmetric h@xmath0 profiles ( 10% full - width @xmath7 200kms@xmath8 ) associated with infall , even though the 10% width is somewhat below the wb limit and no caii or oi emission is noticeable .",
    "if so , ic348 - 355 is the latest spectral type ( lowest mass ) accretor known to date .",
    "putting together now all the young objects near or below the substellar boundary ( @xmath1 m5 and later ) with published high - resolution optical spectra , we have 4 objects in @xmath2 ophiuchus , 10 in ic 348 , 14 in taurus and 11 in upper scorpius . of these",
    ", optical spectral signatures of accretion are found in 1 object in @xmath2 oph ( gy 5 ) , 5 in ic 348 ( discussed above ) , 3 in taurus ( cida-1 , gm tau , v410 anon 13 ) and 1 in upper sco ( usco 75 ( m6 ) , adopting an accretion cutoff of @xmath1 200 kms@xmath8 in 10% width ) . the vast majority of @xmath2 oph vlm objects were inaccessible to our optical spectroscopy because of significant extinction , presumably due to circumstellar as well as interstellar material .",
    "thus , our ( small ) @xmath2 oph sample is heavily biased against possible accretors , and should not be used to estimate the accreting fraction .",
    "considering the other three clusters , which are much less affected by this bias , we find that @xmath150% of the vlm objects show disk accretion at an age @xmath16 2 myr ( ic 348 ) , @xmath1 20% at age @xmath1 3 myr ( taurus ) , and @xmath1610% by @xmath1 5 myr ( upper sco ) .",
    "while there are uncertainties in the cluster ages , ic 348 is likely to be younger than taurus and upper sco .",
    "thus , we appear to be seeing a decrease in the fraction of accreting young sub - stellar objects with increasing age .",
    "a decrease in brown dwarf disk frequency with age is also seen in measurements of infrared excess .",
    "while a large fraction @xmath16080% of brown dwarfs in the @xmath16 3 myr - old @xmath2 oph , ic 348 , and trapezium clusters show near - infrared excess indicative of disks , the fraction appears to be lower in the somewhat older @xmath21 orionis ( @xmath15 - 8 myr ) and tw hydrae ( @xmath110 myr ) groups ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "2003 ; jayawardhana , ardila & stelzer 2002 ; muench et al .",
    "2001 , liu et al .",
    "the disk fractions as measured by near - infrared excess are roughly comparable between tts and sub - stellar objects in the same cluster .",
    "the evidence to date is consistent with similar timescales for inner disk dissipation in young brown dwarfs and low - mass stars ( jayawardhana et al . 1999 ; 2001 ; haisch , lada & lada 2001 ) .      in field @xmath1",
    "m5m8 dwarfs , a saturation - type rotation - activity connection is seen : stars rotating above a threshold velocity ( @xmath1 5 kms@xmath8 ) exhibit a saturated level of chromospheric h@xmath0 flux , while slower rotators show a range of ( smaller ) fluxes ( mohanty & basri 2003 ) .",
    "we will explore this issue for our young vlm objects in a future paper , after deriving effective temperatures so that observed h@xmath0 equivalent widths can be converted to fluxes .",
    "however , we note here that the h@xmath0 widths in our sample of non - accretors are at least as large as in saturated field dwarfs of similar spectral type ( @xmath1 3 - 10 ) . indeed , in three cases  ic348 - 256 and cfht - bd - tau-3 and 4 ",
    "the equivalent widths are many times higher than usually seen in quiescent m dwarfs , and are reminiscent of intense chromospheric flaring .",
    "interestingly , cfht - bd-3 shows very strong h@xmath0 emission in two observations separated by a year .",
    "all these facts indicate that chromospheric activity levels in young vlm objects are at least as high as , and possibly significantly higher than , in older field dwarfs of similar spectral type .",
    "our high - resolution optical spectra provide the most compelling evidence yet for a t tauri - like accretion phase in many sub - stellar objects , qualitatively similar to that of their stellar counterparts .",
    "the lifetimes of inner disks around brown dwarfs do not appear to be vastly different from those of t tauri disks .",
    "thus , the observational evidence to date favors a similar mechanism for the formation of stellar and sub - stellar objects .",
    "while it is too early to rule out the ejected embryo hypothesis for the origin of at least some brown dwarfs , our results do not support it : the naive expectation of signficantly shorter lifetimes for sub - stellar disks is not borne out by the data .",
    "however , current numerical simulations do not have sufficient resolution to determine whether a sub - stellar object with a small , truncated disk should be an accretor at a few million years ( bate et al .",
    "future simulations should clarify this issue . on the observational front , longer - wavelength measurements with the _ space infrared telescope facility _ and/or the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy",
    "could constrain the sizes of brown dwarf disks and thus determine if they are truncated as expected in the ejection scenario .",
    "other important insights could come from investigating even younger objects , namely embedded ( proto- ) brown dwarfs , with high - resolution near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the great cultural significance of mauna kea for native hawaiians , and express our gratitude for permission to observe from its summit .",
    "we also thank the keck observatory staff for their outstanding assistance over the past several years . this work was supported in part by nsf grants",
