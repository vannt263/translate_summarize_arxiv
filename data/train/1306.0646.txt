    "the naming game ( ng ) @xcite is a simple multi - agent model that employs mutual bipartite interactions within a population of individuals which leads to the emergence of a shared communication scheme . in each game a randomly selected pair of agents interact to negotiate conventions , i.e. , associations between forms ( names ) and meanings ( for example objects in the environment , linguistic categories etc . ) .",
    "the negotiation of conventions takes place as follows : one of the agents ( acting as a speaker ) attempts to draw attention of the other agent ( acting as the hearer ) toward the external meaning ( i.e. , an object or a category ) by the production of a conventional form . in case",
    "the hearer is able to express the proper meaning of the form uttered by the speaker the agent pair is assumed to meet a mutual consensus and the interaction is called a  success \" .",
    "consequently , both the agents update their form - meaning repertoire by removing all competing forms corresponding to the meaning except the  winning \" one currently uttered by the speaker . on the other hand ,",
    "if the hearer produces a wrong interpretation then she takes lesson from the meeting by learning this new form - meaning association and in this case the interaction is termed as a `` failure '' .",
    "thus , on the basis of success and failure of the hearer in producing meaning of the name , both the interacting agents reshape their internal form - meaning association . through successive interactions ,",
    "the adjustment of such individual associations collectively leads or should lead to the emergence of a global consensus .",
    "the naming game model is one of the simplest examples of a framework progressively leading to the establishment of human - like languages .",
    "it was initially formulated to understand the role of self - organization in the evolution and change of human languages @xcite . since then",
    ", this model has acquired a paradigmatic role in the novel field of semiotic dynamics ( see  @xcite for a series of references ) that primarily investigates how language evolves through the invention and successive adoption of new words and grammatical constructions .",
    "ng finds wide applications in various fields ranging from artificial sensor network as a leader election model @xcite to the social media as an opinion formation model @xcite .",
    "more advanced models  @xcite attempting to explain further complex processes like categorization have also been built on top of the basic naming game framework .    ,",
    "( b ) number of distinct words @xmath0 and ( c ) success rate @xmath1 with time for a community size @xmath2 . , width=264 ]    in this paper , we revisit the basic construction of this model and argue that it is too stringent in removing all the entries except the winning one from the agent repertoire after a successful interaction .",
    "further , it has to be noted that learning is seldom unidirectional as in case of a failure in the original naming game ; in contrast , we believe that learning activity most of the times is reciprocal @xcite . therefore , here we redefine the interaction rules in order to address the above limitations by having a symmetric model where on a success both the agents sort out all the common information that they have while on a failure enhance each of their knowledge by learning all the form - meaning associations that the other partner only knew so far .",
    "one can intuitively posit that this process should lead to the emergence of a faster consensus than the original naming game owing to the fact that ( a ) the agents learn more and ( b ) the agreement criteria is relaxed , thereby , increasing manifolds the probability of successful communication .",
    "we perform rigorous numerical simulations to obtain the scaling relations for this revised model and explicitly show that for a population of @xmath3 agents the time to reach global consensus indeed scales as @xmath4 as opposed to @xmath5 for the original naming game .     of configurations having",
    "more than 1 distinct word per agent in the stable state has been plotted against the community size @xmath3 .",
    "a power law is observed like @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "there are @xmath3 agents in a community .",
    "each agent @xmath8 has an inventory of words whose length @xmath9 may be arbitrarily long .",
    "the community evolves under a dynamical process where a long sequence of mutual bipartite information sharings takes place which finally reaches a stable state where all agents have the same set of common words . at the initial stage",
    "all agents have empty inventories i.e. , @xmath10 for all @xmath11 . in an interaction a pair of distinct agents @xmath11 and @xmath12 of inventory lengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively are selected randomly with uniform probability from all the agents .",
    "one of them , say the @xmath11-th agent is randomly selected between the two and is termed as the ` speaker ' where as the @xmath12-th agent is called the ` hearer ' .",
    "the time @xmath15 is discrete and is measured in terms of the number of interactions .",
    "the interaction between them can take place in the following three possible ways :    a. _ invention : _ in this case the inventory list of the speaker is empty .",
    "the speaker picks up a new word and keeps it at the bottom of his inventory .",
    "since this is a new word , it can not be present in the inventory of the @xmath12-th agent .",
    "therefore this new word is simply added at the top of the inventory of the @xmath12-th agent .",
    "( blue ) and the average convergence time @xmath16 ( red ) against the community size @xmath3 .",
    "the exponents are @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    ", width=264 ]    b. _ success : _ in this case the inventory length of the speaker is non - zero .",
    "the speaker and the hearer share information about their contents , sort out the common contents and only the common words are retained .",
    "that means the inventories of lengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the speaker and the hearer respectively are compared and the number @xmath19 of common words are sorted out . in case @xmath20 then this possibility is called a success",
    ". the inventories of both the speaker and the hearer are then shrunk to @xmath19 entries where only the common words are kept .",
    "c. _ failure : _ if the inventories have non - zero lengths yet there is no common word between them , then the lists are merged together and both the agents have the same combined list .",
    "it is to be noted that in this model the success and failure rules are symmetric with respect to the speaker and the hearer .    at any arbitrary intermediate time",
    "@xmath15 the total number of words in the community is denoted by @xmath21 and the total number of distinct words is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "the dynamics starts with the inventory lengths @xmath10 for all @xmath11 . at very early times",
    "almost all interactions are of type a. during this period both @xmath21 and @xmath22 grow very fast , i.e. , linearly with time .",
    "as time proceeds more and more agents have non - zero inventory lengths and therefore the chances of interactions of types b and c become increasingly likely . consequently @xmath21 reaches a maximum at a specific time @xmath23 and then it decreases with time ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . on the other hand",
    "the number of distinct words @xmath22 nearly saturates around a fixed mean value .",
    "eventually @xmath22 also decreases gradually and the community finally converges at the time @xmath24 to a stable state which is a fixed point ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . in this stable state @xmath25 takes a value @xmath26 when every inventory has the same set of @xmath27 common words , @xmath27 being a small positive integer .",
    "therefore in contrast to the naming game model where @xmath27 = 1 @xcite , there could be multiple globally common words in our model i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "consequently @xmath22 finally reaches the value @xmath27 .",
    "in addition a third quantity @xmath29 is also calculated which measures the success rate of an interaction at time @xmath15 .",
    "in other words @xmath29 is the fraction of a large number of independent runs which have successful moves at time @xmath15 and its variation with time is shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) .     against the community size @xmath3 on a @xmath30 scale .",
    "( b ) the slopes @xmath31 between pairs of successive points in ( a ) gradually increases with increasing @xmath3 and has been plotted against @xmath32 to obtain the asymptotic value of @xmath33 = 1.539 .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "the simulation algorithm can be described as follows .",
    "positive integer numbers starting from unity are used for representing different words . therefore at any arbitrary intermediate stage if @xmath34 distinct words have already been used , to choose a new word",
    "one simply selects the number @xmath35 .",
    "it turned out that defining an array @xmath36 is very useful , @xmath36 keeps track of the number of times the word @xmath37 has occurred with all agents . in case a , @xmath36 is increased by 2 : @xmath38 . however to check if an interaction is a case of success or failure , one first compares the inventories of the @xmath11-th and the @xmath12-th agents .",
    "therefore every word of the list @xmath13 has to be checked in the list @xmath14 and vice versa .",
    "this is easily done by using another array @xmath39 and for every word @xmath37 in @xmath13 and @xmath14 one makes @xmath40 .",
    "after that the number of locations with @xmath41 are the number of common words between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "let this number be @xmath19 and only these common words are kept in another array @xmath42 . at the same time",
    "we also count that out of @xmath19 such common words how many have @xmath43 values greater than 2 , i.e. , these words have not only occurred in @xmath13 and @xmath14 but also in the inventories of other agents .",
    "let this number be @xmath44 . if @xmath45 it is a case of success and if @xmath46 its is a case of failure .     and the second largest cluster @xmath47 for a community with @xmath3 = 16384 agents .",
    "it is seen that while the size of the largest cluster grows almost ( but not exactly ) monotonically , the size @xmath48 of the second largest cluster reaches a maximum at time @xmath49 and then gradually decreases to zero .",
    "the time axes has been scaled by the characteristic time @xmath49 .",
    ", width=264 ]    in case of success we first update the @xmath43 array . for each entry",
    "@xmath37 in @xmath13 and @xmath14 we first make @xmath50 . therefore during this updating procedure whenever @xmath36 becomes zero",
    "we reduce @xmath34 by one : @xmath51 .",
    "let there be @xmath52 distinct entries in the inventories of @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath36 becomes zero .",
    "then the @xmath19 words in @xmath42 array are copied to @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath53 is updated like : @xmath54 and @xmath34 is updated like : @xmath55 .",
    "this completes a successful interaction .    in the case of failure the combined list of @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "are copied to the inventory lists of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for each such word the @xmath43 value",
    "is increased by unity .",
    "the total number of words @xmath53 is increased as @xmath56 , the number of distinct words @xmath34 remains same .",
    "this completes an unsuccessful interaction ( see table i ) .",
    ".summary of the rules a , b and c for the changes in the total number of words @xmath21 and the number of distinct words @xmath22 at any arbitrary time @xmath15 . [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]",
    "it is noticed that on increasing the community size @xmath3 the probability that an arbitrary configuration has the same set of @xmath27 distinct words per agent in the final stable state decreases for @xmath28 and it increases to unity for @xmath57 .",
    "we have measured the fraction @xmath58 of a large sample of uncorrelated configurations that have @xmath27 words in the final stable configurations .",
    "the variation of @xmath59 has been shown in fig .",
    "2 . a plot of @xmath60 vs. @xmath3 on a @xmath30 scale gives a nice straight line for the intermediate range of @xmath3 .",
    "this indicates that the growth of @xmath59 to unity as @xmath3 increases follows a power law like @xmath61 and our measured value of @xmath62 is 1.13(2 ) .     where the size of the second largest cluster is maximum has been plotted with the community size @xmath3 on a @xmath30 scale for @xmath63 .",
    "the variation seems to be a power law : @xmath64 .",
    "( b ) slopes between successive points has @xmath3 dependence and we plot @xmath65 vs. @xmath66 which fits best to a straight line . the extrapolated value @xmath67 = 1.12 . , width=264 ]    the mean maximal time @xmath68 and the mean convergence time @xmath16",
    "have been measured for different values of @xmath3 and are plotted using a @xmath30 scale in fig .",
    "the community sizes which have been simulated varied from @xmath69 , increased by a factor of 2 in successive steps .",
    "these data fit very well to straight lines . therefore assuming power law variations like @xmath70 we obtained @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this observation leads us to conclude that both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are approximately the same and has a value 1.13(1 ) .",
    "it may be noted that these exponents are much smaller than the original naming game ( both @xmath71 and @xmath72 equal to 1.5 ) @xcite .",
    "this faster consensus is possibly a consequence of the fact that the interaction rule here is symmetric thus increasing the possibility of alignment between the agents through fewer interactions as compared to the original naming game .",
    "further , here the stable state criteria is also relaxed , so the agents are assumed to reach consensus even if they do not agree on only a single word .",
    "with time @xmath73 .",
    "( b ) finite size scaling of the data in ( a ) , plot of @xmath74 vs. @xmath75n^{0.13}$ ] exhibits a data collapse .",
    ", width=264 ]    next in fig 4 .",
    "we plotted the average maximal number of words @xmath76 against @xmath3 on a @xmath30 scale for the same community sizes . here",
    "again we assumed a power law variation like @xmath77 and the average slope is measured using a least square fit method .",
    "we obtained an average value of @xmath78 .",
    "further , this analysis has been done in more detail .",
    "the intermediate slopes @xmath31 between successive pairs of points have been measured and extrapolated against @xmath32 .",
    "the extrapolation fits very well to a straight line and in the limit of @xmath79 the value of @xmath80 has been obtained .",
    "this value of @xmath33 is comparable with 1.5 in the original naming game model @xcite .",
    "it may be noticed that the main difference between the present model and the original naming game arises from the fact that here a failure is caused when none of the words known by the speaker is also known by the hearer as opposed to the mean field case where the sufficient condition for failure is that the one random word selected by the speaker is unknown to the hearer .",
    "a similar argument also holds for the success case where the success probability in this case is determined by whether the hearer knows one or two or three or up to any number of words known by the speaker unlike the mean field case where the success is determined by the match of the one random word selected by the speaker .",
    "therefore , intuitively a single success or failure event in our model corresponds to an accumulation of a set of a number of independent success and failure events in the mean field case thus making the current dynamics faster and the overall exponents different .",
    "at an intermediate time @xmath15 there are @xmath22 distinct words and in general each word is shared by a number of agents . similar to the percolation phenomena @xcite we define the cluster size @xmath81 associated with the @xmath11-th word as the number of distinct agents which have the word @xmath11 in their inventories . in the algorithm described in section 3",
    "we have stored the cluster sizes in the array @xmath82 . as time evolves cluster sizes of some words gradually",
    "vanish but at the same time the cluster sizes of the other words grow . finally only @xmath27 distinct words survive whose cluster sizes are exactly @xmath3 and at this point of time the dynamics reaches the fixed point .",
    "it may be noted that the size of a particular cluster increases in the failure rule and decreases in the success rule only by one agent at a time .",
    "we keep track of the variation of the size of the largest cluster @xmath83 and observe how it almost monotonically increases and assumes the size @xmath3 at the fixed point ( fig .",
    "5 ) . at an intermediate stage",
    "there may be a number of distinct clusters whose sizes are equal to the largest cluster size @xmath84 .",
    "we define the fractional size of the largest cluster at time @xmath15 averaged over many independent runs as : @xmath85 in addition we define the size @xmath86 of the second largest cluster as well .",
    "in contrast to @xmath87 the value of @xmath86 gradually increases to a maximum value and then systematically decreases to zero at the fixed point ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "we define another characteristic time @xmath49 at which the second largest cluster assumes its maximum value .",
    "this is the transition time when the second largest cluster starts dismantling and the largest cluster grows at its fastest rate which signifies the onset of correlation in the community .    in fig .",
    "6(a ) the characteristic time @xmath88 averaged over many independent runs has been plotted on a @xmath30 scale against the community sizes @xmath89 .",
    "while the points seem to fit a nice straight line on the average , a closer look reveals that here again the local slopes between successive pairs of points have a systematic variation . assuming that the functional form would indeed be a power law in the limit of @xmath79 as @xmath90 we have extrapolated the local slopes @xmath65 with a negative power of @xmath3 .",
    "the best value of this correction exponent is 0.42 and in fig .",
    "6(b ) a plot of @xmath65 against @xmath66 gives a nice straight line for large @xmath3 values .",
    "extrapolating to @xmath79 we obtained @xmath91 .    finally in fig .",
    "7 the average value of the largest cluster size @xmath74 has been plotted for three different community sizes @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we first scale the time axis @xmath94 so that the scaled time could be treated similar to the site / bond occupation probability in percolation theory . the scaled axis",
    "is then shifted by 2.98 and then again scaled by @xmath95 to obtain a data collapse .    to summarize we devised a new model for information sharing and sorting in a community of agents .",
    "three types of mutual bipartite interactions take place among the randomly selected pairs of agents . here",
    "the interactions are more symmetric and less restricted compared to the ordinary naming game . by invention new words are created , by failure inventories are shared and by success only the common words are sorted out .",
    "the dynamics of the system is dominated initially by invention , followed by rapid growth of different words dominated by failure and finally the system gradually gets rid of uncommon words dominated by success moves .",
    "the system finally reaches the stable state where each agent has the same set of @xmath27 words in his inventory . using extensive numerical studies we find that the exponents describing the characteristic time scales and the maximum number of words of this model assume a completely distinct set of values compared to the ordinary naming game .",
