    "prestellar core formation in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) is an important issue in theoretical studies of star formation , because these cores are the immediate precursors of protostars .",
    "it is believed that the magnetic field and supersonic turbulence may both play important roles in core formation and subsequent evolution . in gmcs",
    ", simulations starting more than a decade ago have shown that overdense structures generated by supersonic turbulence may collapse gravitationally to form protostellar systems , while also attracting material from their surroundings ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic fields limit compression in large - scale turbulence - induced shocks , channel material toward forming filaments , provide support for cores as they grow , and remove angular momentum in collapsing cores @xcite .    because gmcs are only lightly ionized , and magnetic fields are only coupled to charged particles , magnetic stresses are mediated by ion - neutral collisions , and are affected by the level of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "analytic studies and numerical simulations have shown that supersonic motions accelerate ambipolar diffusion @xcite .",
    "similar simulations with both strong turbulence and ambipolar diffusion have also demonstrated core evolution times , efficiency of star formation , and core structure similar to observations @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied the one - dimensional c - type shocks and identified a transient stage of turbulence - accelerated ambipolar diffusion",
    ". this transient stage , with timescale @xmath10  myr ( depending on ionization ) , can explain the enhanced diffusion rate and affect the magnetization of cores that form .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter co14 ) , we applied three - dimensional numerical simulations to study the roles of magnetic fields and ambipolar diffusion during prestellar core formation in turbulent cloud environments .",
    "our simulations adopted the model framework of @xcite to focus on the shocked layer produced by turbulent converging flows , and surveyed varying ionization and angle between the upstream flow and magnetic field . in simulations",
    ", we found hundreds of self - gravitating cores with masses @xmath11  m@xmath12 and sizes @xmath13  pc , all formed within @xmath14  myr .    in",
    ", we also found that core masses and sizes do not depend on either the ionization or upstream magnetic field direction , and ambipolar diffusion is in fact not necessary to form low - mass supercritical cores .",
    "our analysis showed that this is the result of anisotropic contraction along field lines , which can be clearly seen in our simulations , with or without ambipolar diffusion ( see also ) . in the anisotropic core formation model ,",
    "low - mass magnetically supercritical cores form rapidly even in a strongly magnetized medium with high ionization .",
    "this explains the prevalence of magnetically supercritical cores in observations .    using a simple scaling argument , suggested the characteristic core mass may be set by the mean turbulent pressure in a gmc , regardless of magnetic effects .",
    "the predicted core mass is a factor @xmath15 lower than the thermal bonnor - ebert mass at the mean density in the cloud , where @xmath16 is the turbulent mach number .",
    "previously , @xcite proposed a similar formula based on the preferred scale for gravitational fragmentation of post - shock layers , for the purely hydrodynamic case .",
    "@xcite also argued for a similar characteristic mass , based on statistics of turbulent flows . although the analyses of @xcite and @xcite neglect magnetic fields , the end result is similar to the prediction of that incorporates magnetic effects , with the turbulent pressure in a cloud setting the characteristic core mass .    here ,",
    "following , we continue our study of anisotropic core formation in turbulent molecular clouds .",
    "we extend our previous numerical study to explore how the turbulent and magnetic pressures of the pre - shock gas can affect core formation in the compressed region .",
    "we demonstrate that the dependence of core properties on pre - shock parameters are similar to those predicted by the anisotropic core formation model of .",
    "we also compare our results with observations , showing that the mass - size relationship and ratio of mass to critical value of our simulations is comparable to that seen in perseus and other star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we review the anisotropic core formation model in section  [ sec::anicore ] , outlining the successive dynamical stages and associated parameter dependence expected .",
    "section  [ sec::methods ] describes the equations solved in our numerical simulations , and specifies the model parameter set we shall consider .",
    "the post - shock gas structure for varying parameters is analyzed in section  [ sec::postshock ] , including physical properties of the compressed layer ( section  [ sec::pslayer ] ) , and development of filaments within it ( section  [ sec::psfila ] ) . in section  [ sec::cores ]",
    "we provide quantitative results for masses , sizes , magnetizations , and other physical properties of the bound cores identified from our simulations , and compare to predictions from .",
    "we also compare these results with observations ( section  [ sec::obs ] ) , focusing on interpreting the physical state of super - jeans mass cores and mass - size relationships .",
    "section  [ sec::summary ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "and radius @xmath17 _ ( top right)_. when the length of the cylinder has shrunk to satisfy @xmath18 , it can be treated as an isotropic sphere with radius @xmath17 , which will collapse if the self - gravity overcomes thermal pressure .",
    "contraction along the post - shock magnetic field creates dense filaments , and the densest regions within the filament continue contracting as quasi - spherical cores _ ( bottom left)_. ]    here we briefly review the anisotropic condensation model of core formation proposed in .",
    "we consider a strongly - magnetized post - shock region created by a large - scale converging turbulent flow within a cloud .",
    "as shown in ( see figures  3@xmath195 there ) , the magnetic field will lie primarily parallel to the shock front in the layer no matter what the initial inclination angle is , because only the component of the field parallel to the shock front ( or perpendicular to the inflow ) is amplified .",
    "equation  ( 4 ) of gives the compression ratio for the component of the magnetic field that is amplified .",
    "the anisotropic condensation model describes core formation in the post - shock layer with density @xmath20 and threaded by magnetic field strength @xmath21 ( figure  [ anisotropic ] , top left ) . for a cylinder with radius @xmath17 and length @xmath22 along the magnetic field ( figure  [ anisotropic ] , _ top right _ ) , if @xmath23 ( see equations  ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) of ) for @xmath24 it is gravitationally stable to transverse contraction across the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetic field does not prohibit contraction along the length of the cylinder , and gravity will be able to overcome pressure forces if @xmath22 exceeds the thermal jeans length within the post - shock layer , @xmath25 or @xmath26 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the total surface density of the post - shock layer .",
    "in this situation , longitudinal contraction along a flux tube can continue until an approximately isotropic core with @xmath18 is produced ( figure  [ anisotropic ] , _ bottom _ ) , with density @xmath28 at this point , transverse contraction is no longer impeded by the magnetic field provided the original @xmath29 so the core is magnetically supercritical ( note that the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio remains the same during the longitudinal contraction ) .",
    "the core will also have sufficient gravity to overcome thermal pressure support provided its mass is comparable to that of a critical bonnor - ebert sphere at ambient density @xmath30 , which corresponds to radius ( prior to central concentration ) @xmath31 combining @xmath29 with equations  ( [ lcrit])-([raniso ] ) , this yields @xmath32    in equation  ( [ rhop ] ) , we have assumed a strong magnetized isothermal shock with downstream magnetic pressure balanced by upstream ram pressure ( @xmath33 ) ) is comparable to the upstream ram pressure ( @xmath34 ) , while the thermal pressure ( @xmath35 ) and dynamic pressure ( @xmath36 ) in the post - shock layer are about @xmath37 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "therefore it is safe to say that the post - shock magnetic pressure is the dominant component that balances the upstream ram pressure .",
    "] so that @xmath38 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the density and inflow velocity of the shock , respectively , and @xmath39 for @xmath40 the mean molecular weight .",
    "we can then solve for the critical radius and mass that allows an anisotropically formed core to be both magnetically and thermally supercritical : @xmath41 and @xmath42 equation  ( [ mcrit ] ) uses @xmath43 .",
    "equations  ( [ rcrit ] ) and ( [ mcrit ] ) suggest that the characteristic mass of prestellar cores formed in post - shock regions in magnetized gmcs is determined by the dynamical pressure in the cloud , independent of the cloud s magnetization , when anisotropic condensation along the magnetic field is taken into account",
    ". already showed that models with varying upstream magnetic field directions have similar values of the median core mass and radius . here , we extend our previous investigation to consider variation in the inflow velocities and background magnetic field strength .",
    "the simulation setup is similar to , and is summarized here .",
    "we employ a three - dimensional ideal mhd model with convergent flow , self - gravity , and a perturbed turbulent velocity field @xcite .",
    "these numerical simulations are conducted using the _ athena _ mhd code @xcite with the roe riemann solver . as we found in that ambipolar diffusion",
    "plays a secondary role in core formation , here we consider ideal mhd .",
    "the equations we solve are :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 . for simplicity , we adopt an isothermal equation of state @xmath46 with @xmath47  km / s . for both the whole simulation box initially and the inflowing gas subsequently , we apply perturbations following a gaussian random distribution with a fourier power spectrum @xmath48 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity dispersion @xmath49 thus depends on the mach number of the inflow @xmath16 ( see equations  ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) in ) , as @xmath50 .",
    "our simulation box is @xmath14  pc on each side , representing a region within a gmc where a large - scale supersonic converging flow with velocity @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( i.e. in the center - of - momentum frame ) collides .",
    "the @xmath53-direction is the large - scale inflow direction , and we adopt periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath54- and @xmath55-directions .",
    "we initialize the background magnetic field in the cloud , @xmath56 , in the @xmath54-@xmath53 plane , with an angle @xmath57 with respect to the convergent flow .",
    "the number density of the neutrals , defined as @xmath58 , is set to @xmath59  @xmath60 in the initial conditions and in the upstream converging flow .",
    "the physical parameters defining each model are then the inflow mach number and upstream magnetic field strength @xmath61 and @xmath56 .",
    "we choose @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath2 to look at the dependence of core mass / size on the inflow velocity , and @xmath64 , @xmath63 , and @xmath65 g to test whether the initial magnetization of the cloud can affect the core properties ( see table  [ simresults ] ) .",
    "similar to our previous work , we repeat each model @xmath66 times with different random realizations of the same turbulent power spectrum to collect sufficient statistical information . note that the resolution adopted in ( @xmath67  pc ) is not high enough to resolve strong shocks generated by high inflow velocity , especially @xmath68 cases .",
    "therefore , we increased our resolution to @xmath69 for all models in this work , such that @xmath70  pc .",
    "we use h - correction @xcite to suppress the carbuncle instability , and , when needed , first order flux correction @xcite ( i.e.  dropping back to first - order flux estimates for updating the gas variables , if higher - order estimates results in negative density ) . from each simulation , we apply the _ grid _ core - finding method @xcite , which uses the largest closed gravitational potential contours around single local minimums as core boundaries .",
    "we then select the gravitationally bound cores as those with negative total energy ( sum of gravitational , magnetic , and thermal energy ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to measure the mass and size for each identified core . for the magnetic flux within a core , we first find the plane that includes the minimum of the core s gravitational potential and is perpendicular to the average magnetic field direction within the core .",
    "this plane separates the core into an upper half and a lower half , and we can measure the magnetic flux @xmath71 through the core by summing up @xmath72 in either the upper or lower half of the core surface ( see )",
    ". the normalized mass - to - magnetic flux ratio of the core is therefore @xmath73 .",
    ".summary of the post - shock properties measured and derived from simulations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     several observations have found that there is a power - law relationship between the core mass and its size , @xmath74 , with @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ mvsr ] is the binned mass - size plot from all identified cores in our simulations , compared to the observed cores found in the perseus molecular cloud ( reported in * ? ? ?",
    "similar to the observations , the binned data from our simulations show @xmath76 for the power - law relationship between core mass and radius . at a given radius ,",
    "our cores have slightly higher mass than those in perseus .",
    "a relationship @xmath77 would suggest that the core surface density @xmath78 is constant for cores regardless of their masses and sizes .",
    "figure  [ sigmamass ] shows the scatter plot of the core column density ( @xmath79 ) versus core mass for all cores formed in our simulations .",
    "although core mass varies over nearly three orders of magnitude ( @xmath80  m@xmath12 ) , @xmath81 is within a factor of @xmath63 .",
    "the mean value is @xmath82  @xmath83 . by comparison",
    ", we found in section  [ sec::psfila ] that the overdense filamentary structures have column density @xmath84  @xmath83 at the time of collapse .",
    "thus , the typical core column density @xmath85 .",
    "however , any @xmath86 value indicates that @xmath81 increases with @xmath87 or @xmath88 , and this trend is evident in figure  [ sigmamass ] , for different models .",
    "figure  [ mrfitcomp ] shows the mass - radius relations for individual models in our simulations as well as the fitted @xmath89 power - law ( the complete fitting coefficients are listed in table  [ mrfit ] ) .",
    "we found that the fitted @xmath90 values are generally higher than @xmath91 , implying that @xmath81 is not a constant over cores with different masses and sizes .",
    ", and more dispersion , than individual models . ]",
    "this means that it is possible that there is no  universal \" core column density , but simply a weak dependence of @xmath81 on parameters , which is difficult to identify from the present models .",
    "for example , the post - shock column density at the time of core collapse varies as @xmath92 ( see equation  ( [ npstcoll ] ) ) , and filament column densities appear to follow a similar trend .",
    "if the mean core column density is also a multiple of this , then it would vary by only a factor two for our models , which all have @xmath93  @xmath60 and have @xmath7 varying by a factor four .",
    "we do indeed find a higher mean @xmath81 for @xmath94  km / s ( @xmath95  @xmath83 ) compared to @xmath96  km / s ( @xmath97  @xmath83 ) .",
    "further investigations , both observational and computational , are needed to reach a clearer conclusion .",
    "in this paper , we extended the investigation of to further examine the anisotropic core formation model and test the theoretical scalings of core properties over a larger parameter space .",
    "we carried out fully three - dimensional ideal mhd simulations with self - gravitating gas , including supersonic convergent flows with local turbulence .",
    "our models allow for varying inflow mach number and magnetic field strength of the background cloud .",
    "our simulation results demonstrate that the ram pressure of the converging flow ( @xmath34 ) is the dominant factor controlling the physical properties of cores formed in the shocked layer .",
    "these core properties are consistent with the predictions of the anisotropic core formation theory .",
    "although the post - shock layer is strongly magnetized in all cases , core properties are insensitive to the pre - shock magnetic field strength .",
    "we also compared cores formed in our simulations with those observed in the perseus molecular cloud , and found very similar core mass distribution , super - bonnor - ebert mass ratio , and mass - size relation .      1 .   considering typical gmc conditions , spherically symmetric core formation is impossible in the magnetized post - shock region , because the required mass gathering scales are much larger than the thickness of the shocked layer ( table  [ simresults ] and figure  [ hpsrsph ] ) .",
    "quantitatively , it takes @xmath98  myr for the post - shock layer thickness to be comparable with the magnetic critical length under post - shock conditions ( equation  ( [ ldhps ] ) ) , much longer than typical core formation timescale in our simulations .",
    "filamentary structures formed in the post - shock regions are similar to those found in observations , with dense cores embedded within filaments ( figure  [ spectrummb ] ) .",
    "we measured the filament formation efficiency ( ffe ) to be around @xmath99 ( dependent on the choice of column density threshold of filament ; table  [ filasum ] ) , independent of the pre - shock conditions .",
    "we also found that the filament column density at the time when cores start to collapse is proportional to the mean post - shock column density ; @xmath100 ( figure  [ filacoldps ] ) .",
    "our velocity space - time diagrams ( figure  [ spacetime ] ) show clear evidence that the mass - gathering flows that create cores and filaments are highly anisotropic . until late times ,",
    "flow along the magnetic field is much stronger than in the two perpendicular directions .",
    "however , our simulations also show that the  seeds \" of cores are present even at early times .",
    "this suggests that core and filament formation is simultaneous , instead of the commonly - assumed picture that cores form only after filaments do .",
    "magnetically supercritical cores form within the post - shock layers in all of our simulations , with masses @xmath101  m@xmath12 , sizes @xmath102  pc , and normalized mass - to - flux ratio @xmath103 ( table  [ coresum ] ) .",
    "the core formation timescale is @xmath104  myr , and the core formation efficiency is positively - related to the core collapse time ( figure  [ cfetcoll ] ) .",
    "the statistical distributions of core mass , size , mean magnetic field , and mass - to - flux ratio clearly show that median core properties depend on the pre - shock inflow mach number @xmath105 but not the upstream magnetic field strength @xmath56 ( figures  [ coremasssizedist ] and [ coremaggammadist ] ) .",
    "the theoretical scalings predicted in the anisotropic core formation model are @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 ( equations  ( [ bps])-([mcrit ] ) ) , which agree with our simulation results very well ( figure  [ corepropsum ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the core collapse timescale in our mhd simulations generally follow the relationship @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath110 scaling is consistent with the prediction of @xcite based on hydrodynamic analysis , because the flows in the post - shock layer are primarily parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this also gives the post - shock column density at @xmath110 to be @xmath111 ( equation  ( [ npstcoll ] ) ) .",
    "quantitatively , the median core mass and radius depend on inflow velocity as @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this suggests that the core mass and radius will be , respectively , a factor @xmath114 and @xmath115 lower than the bonnor - ebert critical mass and radius computed using the sound speed and total dynamical pressure ( @xmath34 ) in the cloud ( equations  ( [ bedyn ] ) and ( [ coretobe ] ) ) .",
    "this result is similar to the scaling for characteristic mass proposed by @xcite , but our measured coefficient is higher by a factor @xmath9 . 7 .",
    "cores identified in our simulations have physical properties very similar to those observed in perseus @xcite . in addition , we found similar statistical distributions of @xmath116 in simulations and observations ( figure  [ bedist ] ) .",
    "we suggest that the  super - bonnor - ebert mass cores \" identified in @xcite are probably not supported by magnetic pressure and will collapse gravitationally , since most cores with high @xmath116 in our simulations also have high @xmath117 values , indicating that these cores are magnetically supercritical ( figure  [ gammamdmbe ] ) .",
    "we find ( figure  [ mvsr ] ) a composite mass - radius relation for our simulated prestellar cores comparable to that seen in observations , @xmath89 with @xmath118 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the observed relation is sometimes interpreted as implying a  universal \" core surface density , our results suggest that there might be a weak dependence of the core surface density @xmath119 on core mass or radius ( figure  [ sigmamass ] ) .",
    "we also find that the exponent @xmath90 in the mass - size relation @xmath120 is larger for individual models with consistent shock conditions than the composite from heterogeneous environments ( figure  [ mrfitcomp ] ) .    to conclude",
    ", the success of the anisotropic core formation model for explaining idealized converging turbulent magnetized flows is very encouraging , and provides strong motivation for testing these ideas in global mhd simulations of star - forming molecular clouds .",
    "further investigations considering more extreme conditions of gmcs would also be interesting to examine the properties of core - forming filaments , and potential variations in the core mass - size relationship .",

    "<S> our results correspond to @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 the large - scale mean density and velocity . for our parameter range , the median @xmath8 , but a very high pressure cloud could have lower characteristic core mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find cores and filaments form simultaneously , and filament column densities are a factor @xmath9 greater than the surrounding cloud when cores first collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that cores identified in our simulations have physical properties comparable to those observed in the perseus cloud . </S>",
    "<S> superthermal cores in our models are generally also magnetically supercritical , suggesting that the same may be true in observed clouds . </S>"
