    "the principal goal of the beam energy scan program at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is to study the transition from baryon - free to baryon - rich regime of strongly interacting qcd matter by decreasing the collision energy .",
    "one of questions is what the transport properties of the medium with high baryon density , created at lower beam energies , are .",
    "to address this question we use a state - of - the - art event - by - event viscous hydrodynamic + cascade ( or hybrid ) model to describe the evolution of the collision system .",
    "the hybrid model consists of the pre - equilibrium stage , the fluid dynamical stage and the final hadronic cascade .",
    "the pre - thermal stage of evolution is described by urqmd cascade @xcite .",
    "the interactions are calculated until a hypersurface of a constant bjorken proper time @xmath3 , which is a parameter of the model . at @xmath4",
    "the energy , momentum and charges of particles are smoothly distributed to fluid cells according to a gaussian profile .",
    "the contribution of each particle to a fluid cell @xmath5 is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the differences between particle s position and the coordinates of the hydrodynamic cell @xmath5 .",
    "due to the lack of knowledge about thermalization process , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are another free parameters of the model .",
    "these distributions are used as an initial state for 3-dimensional hydrodynamic expansion , described by relativistic viscous hydrodynamic code ` vhlle ` @xcite .",
    "we use the equation of state based on chiral model @xcite in the fluid stage .",
    "we set bulk viscosity and baryon charge diffusion to zero in the fluid phase , and study the effects of shear viscosity only .",
    "when the energy density reaches a certain value @xmath12 , the hydrodynamic medium is converted to particles ( particlized ) according to cooper - frye prescription @xcite .",
    "the last stage of evolution - hadron rescatterings and decays - is described again with urqmd cascade . for more details see ref .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as a result , the model has three parameters related to the initial state ( starting time @xmath14 and gaussian smearing radii @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , one parameter of the hydrodynamic medium ( shear viscosity over entropy ratio @xmath1 ) and one parameter related to switching from hydrodynamics to cascade ( switching energy density @xmath15 ) .",
    "the main goal is to extract the value of the _ physical _",
    "parameter @xmath1 from comparison with available experimental data .",
    "this goal is , however , complicated by the fact that the observables in the model depend significantly on all the mentioned parameters , not only @xmath1 . a somewhat stronger sensitivity to the initial state parameters compared to hydrodynamic studies at full rhic or lhc energies [ someone ]",
    "is explained by shorter duration of hydrodynamic phase at lower beam energies .    to learn",
    "how exactly final observables depend on the model parameters , we consider the setup with @xmath16  fm , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19  gev/@xmath20 as a `` default '' scenario . on fig .",
    "[ figparamdep ] we show how deviations of parameter values from the `` default '' scenario affect the multiplicity of all hadrons at midrapidity and @xmath21 integrated elliptic flow of all charged hadrons at one particular collision energy @xmath22  gev .",
    "one can summarize the dependencies seen in fig .",
    "[ figparamdep ] in a following way :    * increased @xmath10 smoothens the initial energy density profile in the transverse plane , which leads to smaller gradients and less explosive transverse expansion .",
    "increased @xmath10 also results in decreased ellipticity an initial energy density profile , which is hydrodynamically translated into smaller final elliptic flow . * in a similar manner , the increase of @xmath11 leads to shallower longitudinal gradients and weaker longitudinal expansion .",
    "thus more energy remains at midrapidity to form stronger transverse expansion , which increases @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "larger @xmath11 also results in larger initial entropy of the fluid , which considerably increases the final particle multiplicity . *",
    "increased @xmath14 leads to a shorter lifetime of the hydrodynamic phase , as a result of longer pre - thermal phase . at the same time @xmath14 enters the gaussian energy / momentum smearing profile .",
    "thus its increase acts opposite to the increase of @xmath11 .",
    "the results show that the second effect is stronger . *",
    "increased @xmath24 shortens the effective lifetime of the hydrodynamic phase . the shorter time to develop radial and elliptic flows is not fully compensated by the longer cascade phase , which results in smaller final @xmath23 . since the total entropy is conserved in the ideal hydrodynamic expansion , but increases in the cascade stage , the final particle multiplicity increases with the increase of @xmath24 .",
    "the found dependencies allow us to adjust the values of parameters individually for every collision energy to approximately reproduce the available experimental data points in the bes region .",
    "to simplify the analysis , we keep the same value of switching energy density @xmath15 at all collision energies .",
    "the adjusted values of the parameters are shown in table  [ tbparameters ] .",
    "some of the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figresults ] .    the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath1 in fluid phase is taken to be independent of temperature and chemical potentials , and changes only with collision energy .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath1 can be thought of as effective one for given computational setup .",
    "the parameter adjustment procedure yields @xmath1 values which decrease with increasing collision energy . at lower collision energies",
    "the fluid phase probes thermodynamic region of lower temperature , limited by the particlization temperature from below , and higher chemical potential .",
    "one expects that physical @xmath1 depends on temperature and chemical potential , and not on collision energy .",
    "therefore we conclude that the @xmath25 dependence of the effective @xmath1 we found hints that in more realistic simulations @xmath26 should increase with increasing baryon chemical potential @xmath27 .    .",
