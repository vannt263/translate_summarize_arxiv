    "the top quark was the last piece of quarks that was discovered more than 15 years ago @xcite .",
    "while waiting for the higgs boson at the lhc , the top quark has been making some noise about the presence of new physics . the forward - backward asymmetry ( fba ) in top - quark pair production was found in 2008 by cdf @xcite and by d@xcite . while the standard model ( sm ) only predicts a level as small as a few percent arising from the higher - loop contributions , the measurement by cdf @xcite , however , was as large as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the production angle of the top quark @xmath2 in the @xmath7 rest frame .",
    "the measurement in the @xmath8 laboratory frame is correspondingly smaller , because of the lorentz boost ( washout ) of the partons along the beam axis .",
    "the anomaly did not die out , but gets a reconfirmation in a recent cdf publication @xcite . with a larger data set ( @xmath9 fb@xmath4 ) the fba persists at the level of @xmath10 @xcite , which is a less - than-@xmath11 effect after subtracting the sm contribution of @xmath12 @xcite . though the deviation is slightly smaller",
    ", the most striking feature is that the fba shows distributional preferences .",
    "the fba is the most obvious in the large @xmath0 invariant mass region and in the large rapidity difference @xmath1 region .",
    "the analysis in the cdf paper @xcite showed that the fba is consistent with zero for @xmath13 gev but a larger - than-@xmath14 effect in @xmath15 gev region . at the same time , the analysis also showed that the fba is large in the large rapidity difference @xmath16 region , which is a @xmath11 effect .",
    "they are summarized in the third last row in table  [ table1 ] , where we also show in the second last row the sm predictions from the mcfm @xcite .",
    "if the fba is true , it will indicate the presence of new physics , because within the sm the asymmetry is only up to about 5% @xcite . in the past two years",
    ", numerous works have been carried out to explain the anomaly @xcite .",
    "the explanations can be divided into two categories : ( i ) a @xmath2-channel exchanged particle such as a @xmath3 or a @xmath17 with flavor - changing couplings between the top quark and the @xmath18 or @xmath19 quark , and ( ii ) a heavy @xmath20-channel exchanged particle such as an axial - gluon with specific couplings to the top quark and the light quarks . in the latter case , the couplings are somewhat contrived in order to achieve a positive fba .    in a previous work @xcite , we proposed an extra @xmath3 boson that only couples to the @xmath18 and @xmath2 quarks .",
    "thus , the @xmath21 initial state turns into the @xmath22 final state via a charged - current exchange of the @xmath3 boson in the @xmath2-channel .",
    "we mapped out the suitable parameter space of the @xmath3 mass @xmath23 and the coupling @xmath24 . in this letter , we show that such a @xmath2-channel exchanged particle can easily accommodate a fba and also that it naturally gives rise to a large fba in the large @xmath0 region and in the large @xmath25 region .",
    "we show that for @xmath26 gev with appropriate couplings we can bring the predictions to be within @xmath27 of the data .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "in addition , since the @xmath28 boson proposed is relatively light , only @xmath29 gev , it can be directly produced in association with a top quark or antiquark at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the @xmath30 produced would then decay right away into @xmath31 , giving rise to a top - quark pair plus one jet in the final state .",
    "the irreducible background is qcd production of @xmath32 .",
    "we show that the increase in @xmath22 production by direct @xmath3 production is within @xmath33 error of the measured @xmath22 cross section .",
    "we perform a signal - background analysis based on parton - level calculations",
    ". the cleanest signal of @xmath3 production would be the sharp peak of the invariant mass @xmath34 distribution .",
    "we require one top quark to decay hadronically while the other one semi - leptonically . in this case , one has less confusion in jet combinations , and one can still fully reconstruct the hadronic top and combine with the light jet to form the peak of @xmath3 .",
    "we expect the background to give a continuum in the @xmath34 distribution .",
    "thus , we can count the number of events below the peak for the signal and background . at the end",
    ", we can see that the tevatron can observe such a @xmath3 up to 400 gev while the lhc operating at 7 tev can observe such a @xmath3 almost immediately .",
    "this is an important result of this work .",
    "improvements over our previous work are as follows .    1",
    ".   we use the top - quark mass @xmath35 gev and the most recent published @xmath22 cross section , which are the same as in the most recent cdf publications @xcite .",
    "we calculate the fba as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . through the figures it is clear that larger fba in the large @xmath1 and large @xmath0 region is a generic feature of a new @xmath2-channel exchanged particle .",
    "3 .   with the additional charged @xmath3 boson that we proposed",
    ", we can bring the overall @xmath36 to be around the measured value , the @xmath37 within @xmath33 , and @xmath38 within @xmath39 .",
    "we calculate the direct production of the @xmath3 associated with a top quark at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we show that in the presence of irreducible background of @xmath40 the @xmath3 up to about 400 gev could be observed at the tevatron . on the hand , the @xmath3 all the way to 600 gev",
    "could be easily observed at the lhc .",
    "the production angle @xmath6 in the @xmath22 rest frame is related to the rapidity of the @xmath2 and @xmath41 in the @xmath8 frame by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the square of the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath22 pair .",
    "therefore , the difference @xmath16 between the rapidities of the @xmath2 and @xmath41 in the @xmath8 frame is a close measure of the production angle in the @xmath22 frame .",
    "moreover , the sign of @xmath16 is the same as @xmath44 , such that the asymmetry in eq .",
    "( [ asy ] ) can be given by @xmath45 our parton level calculation uses this definition to calculate the fba .",
    "suppose the interaction vertex for the @xmath3 boson with the down and top quarks is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the chirality projection operators , @xmath48 are the chiral couplings of the @xmath3 boson with fermions , and @xmath24 is the coupling constant . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated that the pure right - handed coupling where @xmath49 and @xmath50 can fit the data in a more consistent way .",
    "also , the pure right - handed @xmath3 is less constrained by the @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "we therefore focus on this case of pure right - handed coupling in what follows .    the process @xmath52 is described by two feynman diagrams , one @xmath20-channel diagram from the one gluon exchange and one @xmath2-channel diagram from the @xmath3 exchange . ignoring the @xmath18 quark mass , the spin- and color - summed amplitude squared is given by @xmath53   \\label{5 } \\\\",

    "the values are chosen such that it can bring the predictions within @xmath63 of the data without violating the constraints on total cross sections and invariant mass distribution @xcite .",
    "we also use the @xmath16 distribution , in which the forward direction @xmath64 has more events than the backward direction @xmath65 , to calculate the fba versus @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",

    "it is implied from table  [ tev - no ] tevatron would have a good chance observing the @xmath3 up to about 400 gev that could be the explanation for the top fba .",
    "furthermore , the observability improves substantially at the lhc-7 .",
    "the chance of observing the @xmath3 all the way to 600 gev is very promising at the lhc-7 with just 100 pb@xmath4 luminosity , as shown by the significance @xmath69 in table  [ lhc - no ] .",
    "further improvement by increasing the luminosity to 1 fb@xmath4 can push the significance to more than 50 at the lhc .",
    "similar analysis at the lhc can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "there was another work using charge asymmetry at the lhc to probe the @xmath3 boson @xcite .",
    "we have shown that with a new particle exchanged in @xmath2-channel the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath22 production increases with the invariant mass @xmath0 and the rapidity difference @xmath1 .",
    "this is a generic feature for any particle exchanged in @xmath2-channel .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the new cdf data on fba can be accommodated using a flavor - changing pure right - handed @xmath3 boson , which couples only to the @xmath18 and @xmath2 quarks with an appropriate coupling constant @xmath24 .",
    "we can bring the fba to within @xmath39 of the data in the large @xmath15 gev region and within @xmath33 in the large rapidity difference @xmath1 region .",
    "the specific @xmath3 model that we proposed is consistent with existing data on the direct search and with flavor - changing current data .",
    "some attempts to find a realistic model for such a flavor - changing gauge boson were in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that such a @xmath3 up to about 400 gev is readily observed at the tevatron with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath4 , and at the lhc with an integrated luminosity of 100 pb@xmath4 , which should be within the current year of running . the signal - background analysis that we performed",
    "is based on parton - level calculations .",
    "more realistic simulation may be necessary .",
    "nevertheless , the present work has indicated that the @xmath3 really has a good chance to be seen .",
