    "relaxation dynamics of interacting particles in a one - dimensional system is often difficult to understand because the traditional coarse - grained descriptions ( such as hydrodynamics or time dependent mean - field type approximations ) fail in this case .",
    "this is because of the existence of long - range correlations mediated through the excluded volume interaction . in such cases ,",
    "random walk models have often proved to be successful in describing the non - exponential relaxation commonly observed in one - dimensional systems .",
    "recently , several experimental studies have reported energy relaxation in one - dimensional or quasi one - dimensional systems such as dna@xcite .",
    "these experiments employed the time dependent fluorescence stokes shift ( tdfss ) technique to gather a quantitative measure of the time scale involved . in one of these experiments bruns _ et al._@xcite have calculated structural relaxation of dna oligonucleotides .",
    "they found that the red shift of the fluorescent spectrum follows a _ logarithmic _ time dependence .",
    "the experiment described above is an example where dimensionality plays an important role in the energy and density relaxation .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a random walk model for the carriers in a one - dimensional channel to mimic the relaxation of energy and density found in experiments described above .",
    "there were several theoretical studies devoted to random walk model in one - dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "many recent studies based on random walk model in one - dimensional systems have explored transport and other dynamical properties such as , dc conductivity , frequency dependent conductivity , effect of bias on diffusion , space and time dependent probability distribution of random walkers , mean residence time and mean first passage time of random walkers etc . @xcite .",
    "the work presented here is based on a master equation for random walk in a _ single - file _ system ( a one - dimensional system that does not allow particles to pass through each other ) that allows exchange of the particles with the bath ( see figure 1 for a schematic illustration ) .",
    "here we employed two model potentials with different characteristics to study the effect of perturbation on the density and energy relaxation processes .",
    "the potentials used here are ( 1 ) inverse of distance potential ( example is a coulomb s field generated by a trapped charge in the lattice ) and ( 2 ) inverse of sixth power of distance potential ( this is a short range interaction compared to coulomb interaction and is taken as attractive part of the lennard - jones interaction ) . energy and density relaxation functions in a one - dimensional channel without number fluctuation is calculated and then compared with that of a channel , where particle number fluctuates due to exchange with the bath .",
    "it is observed that density fluctuation in the channel makes energy relaxation exponential .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives the description of the master equation used in the simulation .",
    "the details of the monte carlo simulations are given in the section 3 .",
    "results of the simulations were analyzed in the section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents the conclusions from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "let the total number of lattice sites in a system consisting of a linear lattice and a bath be @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of lattice sites of the lattice and @xmath6 is the number of accessible bath sites . the time dependent probability @xmath7 of finding a particle in the @xmath8 site of the lattice at time t is given by the following master equation @xmath9 ( the prime on the summation signifies that the term @xmath10 is to be omitted from the sum ) where @xmath11 gives the transition probability of the particle from site @xmath12 to @xmath13 per unit time .",
    "the last two terms of the master equation introduce density fluctuation in the lattice by allowing exchange of particles with the bath . in the master equation ,",
    "the index @xmath14 sums over the bath sites and @xmath15 is the probability of finding a particle in the @xmath16 bath site .",
    "this master equation can be simplified by assuming that lattice sites in the bath are numerous ( @xmath17 ) and the number of walkers in the bath is much larger than that in the lattice .",
    "these assumptions allow us to perform an averaging over the bath sites .",
    "summation in the last two terms of the equation ( 2 ) can be omitted by substituting the properties of the bath with that of an ideal bath defined below .",
    "the sum of the transition probability @xmath18 to the bath sites can be replaced by the term @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , since @xmath18 depends only on the temperature , size and number of particles in the system ( discussed in detail later in this section ) .",
    "this ideal bath has infinite capacity to absorb particles .",
    "similarly , when a particle is absorbed by the lattice this bath site acts as a supplier of infinite number of particles .",
    "the transition probabilities from all lattice sites to the bath are equal and assumed to be independent of the instantaneous state of the bath .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 can be replaced by @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "the resultant master equation is simpler and is given by @xmath25 if only nearest neighbor exchanges are allowed then the master equation can be written as @xmath26 at equilibrium this system represents a grand canonical ensemble .",
    "hence for insertion and removal of the particles in the randomly selected sites we use grand - canonical monte carlo method , where probability ( @xmath27 ) of system having number of particles @xmath28 is@xcite @xmath29},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the inverse of boltzmann constant times absolute temperature ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the thermal de - broglie wavelength , @xmath34 is the length of the linear lattice , @xmath35 is chemical potential and @xmath36 is the potential energy of the linear lattice . particles of this system obey boltzmann distribution at equilibrium , hence the transition probability @xmath37 can be calculated from the total energy cost for the move .",
    "the hopping probability is calculated for a particle from one site to another using metropolis scheme @xcite .",
    "hopping probability of a random walker from one site to the neighboring site of the lattice is given by @xmath38.\\ ] ] the transition probabilities for absorption and desorption from the lattice can be obtained @xcite so as to satisfy the detailed balance at equilibrium as @xmath39,\\\\   w_{out}&=&min[1,\\;\\frac{n}{q}\\;e^{\\beta\\;\\delta e } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 .",
    "a non - trivial aspect of this master equation is that the transition probability @xmath42 _ varies with time _ in response to the number fluctuations .",
    "this explicit time dependence of @xmath42 pose formidable difficulty in obtaining an explicit analytic solution of the problem . in this system of interacting particles ,",
    "the transition probability to neighboring sites depends on the instantaneous probability of that site being occupied . in a one - dimensional channel with hard rod interactions between the carriers , mobility of each carrier",
    "is restricted to a portion of the lattice .",
    "the particles move in the linear lattice under the influence of a chosen potential , which is at a fixed position of this lattice .",
    "hence the energy cost for hopping in the lattice is @xmath43 where @xmath44 for the potential 1 and @xmath45 for the potential 2 . for absorption of particles to the lattice at @xmath13th site @xmath46 where @xmath47 for potential 1 and @xmath48 for potential 2 . for the desorption of particles from the @xmath13th site @xmath49 @xmath40 in this system is constant and equal to the initial number of the particles in the lattice .",
    "this assumption specifies the value of the chemical potential of this linear lattice .",
    "the monte carlo simulations are carried out on a linear lattice , with 50% ( on the average ) of the lattice sites are occupied by the random walkers .",
    "closed boundary condition is used to explore the size effect on the relaxation . in this one - dimensional lattice ,",
    "the adjacent sites are equally spaced and all the sites are identical in energy in the absence of the perturbation . here",
    "inhomogeneity in the lattice is generated by the perturbation of potential introduced in the lattice .",
    "in addition , there is a dynamic disorder in the lattice that originates from the instantaneous rearrangement of the interacting random walkers .",
    "the initial configuration of the random walkers in an unperturbed lattice is chosen from a random distribution , such that no two particles occupy the same site .",
    "the inverse potential arise from coulomb interaction , hence the magnitude of the biasing potential is calculated from the interaction between the charge of the carriers ( @xmath50 ) and the charge at the center of bias ( @xmath51 ) in a medium of dielectric constant @xmath52 . the constant @xmath53 for potential energy can be calculated as @xmath54 . here both the perturbing charge and the charge of the carrier have magnitude of one electron and their signs are opposite . assuming high screening effect , the value of @xmath52 is taken as equal to that of water , that is 80 .",
    "the distance between the adjacent sites in the linear lattice is 4(approximately the vertical distance between two dna base pairs in the double helix ) .",
    "all simulations were conducted near room temperature ( 300k ) .",
    "the value of @xmath53 used in the simulation is -1.7@xmath55 .",
    "compared to coulomb s interaction , the lennard - jones interaction is short ranged , hence the constant @xmath56 is kept high to extend the range of the potential , value of @xmath56 used is -10 @xmath55 .",
    "the non - equilibrium monte carlo simulation starts from a randomly chosen initial configuration",
    ". then a perturbing potential is introduced in the lattice at at time @xmath57 .",
    "subsequent relaxation of energy is monitored .",
    "the simulation is repeated with different initial configurations and the results are averaged . in the monte carlo simulation movements are chosen randomly such that no two events can occur at the same time . in this simulation one monte carlo step is equivalent to one unit of time .",
    "total potential energy of the lattice at any instant of time when perturbed by coulomb potential is given as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a constant .",
    "similarly , for the simulations that use attractive lennard - jones potential as the perturbation , the instantaneous potential energy of the lattice is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "for comparison of relaxation function for different system sizes , we calculate dimensionless energy relaxation function @xmath62 which can be defined as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the instantaneous energy at time @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the average energy of the lattice , in equilibrium with perturbation .",
    "density relaxation is measured in terms of a dimensionless quantity @xmath67 where @xmath68 is defined as @xmath69 .    in the equilibrium simulation",
    "the system is allowed to equilibrate with perturbation for 10,000 steps to get the initial configuration .",
    "the fluctuations in total energy of the system can be defined as @xmath70 . here",
    "a dimensionless energy fluctuation relaxation function can be defined as @xmath71",
    "figure 2 shows the energy relaxation function for different system sizes obtained from the non - equilibrium simulations of a one - dimensional channel without particle fluctuation . at short times , the potential energy of the lattice relaxes faster , as a response to the newly created center of perturbation .",
    "this results in the accumulation of random walkers near the center of the biasing field , which slows down the relaxation rate . at the same time",
    ", channels far from the center of perturbation remain active due to the reduction in the density of particles in that region .",
    "these effects together contribute to the observed slowing down of the relaxation process after the fast initial decay .",
    "as the system size increases the lowest possible energy accessible to the system obviously become lower , hence the relaxation becomes progressively slow as the system size increases .",
    "however , this effect becomes insignificant beyond a limiting size of the lattice beyond which the strength of perturbation becomes negligible . to analyze the behavior of relaxation functions in the system ,",
    "we have fitted the relaxation function to a sum of an exponential and a stretched exponential of the form @xmath72 ( with constraints @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) . in order to compare with the nature of relaxation with the results obtained by bruns _",
    "et al._@xcite , a logarithmic function of the form @xmath75 is also used to fit the relaxation function .",
    "the inset of figure 2 shows the fit of the energy relaxation function with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , when size of the system is @xmath78=200 .",
    "fitting parameters obtained for the function @xmath76 are @xmath79 .",
    "the fitting parameters for the function @xmath77 are @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the stretched exponential function and logarithmic functions both give good description of the energy relaxation function in a one dimensional lattice without density fluctuations , in the presence of the coulomb potential .",
    "the time dependence of stretched exponential @xcite relaxation , is given by the function of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 .",
    "theoretical explanation of the origin of stretched exponential relaxation in the condensed matter have been addressed by many @xcite , including huber and coworkers in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "their model is based on the following simple master equation approach @xmath86 where @xmath87 gives the transition probability of the particle from site @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "stretched exponential relaxation can arise when there is a continuum of relaxation channels and the probability of any single channel being open is much less than unity .",
    "figure 3 shows the density relaxation function ( which is a measure of particle aggregation ) for different sizes of a system without number density fluctuations . at @xmath78=200 ,",
    "a double exponential @xmath88 ( with constraints @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) ( shown in the inset of figure 3 ) fit of the density relaxation function reveals the presence of two distinct time scales in the density relaxation .",
    "the fitting parameters obtained for the double exponential ( @xmath91 ) fit of density relaxation function are @xmath92 .",
    "we now turn to the case when the number of walkers in the lattice can fluctuate due to the exchange with the bath .",
    "figure 4 gives the energy relaxation function plotted for different system sizes for this case .",
    "note that , in this case , the energy relaxation is faster than the non - fluctuating case .",
    "the exchange of particles with bath is equivalent to opening up of many wider channels of relaxation that dominate the relaxation process .",
    "the log @xmath62 versus @xmath65 plot in the inset of figure 4 show straight lines , which is an evidence of exponential relaxation . in this case walkers",
    "can bypass the obstacle caused by hard rod interaction in the path by exchange of particles with the bath .",
    "figure 5 shows the density relaxation function of an open system for different sizes . as system size increases , the effect of coulomb field on the distribution of carriers decreases .",
    "hence the carrier density oscillates around a mean value due to the density fluctuations and the effect of perturbation in the density relaxation remains feeble and short lived .",
    "the energy fluctuation relaxation function for different sizes of a system with constant number density and that is in equilibrium with perturbation is shown in the figure 6 .",
    "this relaxation function shows very slow non - exponential decay .",
    "inset of figure 6 shows the energy relaxation function obtained is well fitted by @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the fitting parameters obtained for the @xmath76 are @xmath93 and the fitting parameters obtained for @xmath77 are @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "note that the energy relaxation function in non - equilibrium and energy fluctuation relaxation function in equilibrium show logarithmic time dependence .      the pronounced non - exponential decay found in non - equilibrium energy relaxation function for coulomb potential is also found in the case of attractive lennard - jones potential .",
    "figure 7 shows the energy relaxation function at different sizes for a system without number fluctuation perturbed by the attractive lennard - jones potential .",
    "the fit of the energy relaxation function with @xmath76 and @xmath77 are shown in the inset of the figure 7 .",
    "the fitting parameters obtained for @xmath76 are @xmath98 and @xmath77 are @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "it is evident from the figure that , in the case of short - ranged interaction , the appropriate function which can fit relaxation function is stretched exponential . here due to the large strength of the potential near the perturbation center , the initial relaxation is driven and faster .",
    "corresponding density relaxation function for different sizes of this system is shown in the figure 8 .",
    "the energy relaxation function ( @xmath62 versus @xmath65 ) of a linear lattice with particle number fluctuation is plotted for different system sizes in the figure 9 .",
    "the inset of the figure 9 shows log of @xmath62 versus @xmath65 plot of the energy relaxation function , which show straight lines that is a signature of exponential relaxation .",
    "it is clear from the figures 4 and 9 that the number fluctuation in the system makes the energy relaxation nearly exponential irrespective of the nature and range of the perturbing potential .",
    "the equilibrium energy fluctuation relaxation function of a system under the lennard - jones perturbation , for different system sizes , is plotted in the figure 10 .",
    "the energy fluctuation in this system is mostly from the region where potential is weak .",
    "the fit of the energy fluctuation relaxation with functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are shown in the inset of the figure 10 .",
    "the fitting parameters for the function @xmath76 are @xmath103 and for @xmath77 are @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 .    finally , note that the stretched exponential fit of relaxation function is more appropriate in this case due to the short range of the potential .",
    "we have found no evidence of logarithmic time dependence for the energy relaxation in this case .",
    "let us first summarize the main results of this work .",
    "we have demonstrated that the cooperative dynamics of random walkers in a simple one - dimensional channel can give rise to highly non - exponential relaxation , when number density fluctuations are not allowed . in these simulations , two perturbing potentials ( the coulomb and the lennard - jones ) have been used to study the effects of perturbing potential on the relaxation process .",
    "the energy relaxation under these potentials can be approximately described by a stretched exponential ( in general ) in a closed system .",
    "the variation in the time scale of relaxation under these two well - known potentials can be understood in terms of the difference in the _ range _ of these potentials .",
    "the coulomb potential being long ranged ( in comparison with the lennard - jones interaction ) , shows much stronger non - exponentiality in the energy relaxation . under the coulomb potential ,",
    "the exponent @xmath30 of non - equilibrium energy relaxation function is 0.52 while under lennard - jones potential it is 0.73 .",
    "the simulations seem to agree with the results of bruns _",
    "et al._@xcite in showing a logarithmic time dependence of the energy relaxation function under the coulomb potential .",
    "however , under the short - ranged lennard jones potential , the energy relaxation function does not show logarithmic time dependence .    in the smaller sized systems",
    "the relaxation is found to be faster and as the system size increases , relaxation slows down , as expected . also as expected , the density fluctuations in this one - dimensional channel make the relaxation function faster and exponential .",
    "when number fluctuation is allowed , random walkers overcome the resistance of the hard rod interactions , by moving in and out of the linear lattice , such that the random walkers experience no major hindrance to their flow . in this case",
    "the system behaves like a system of weakly interacting particles , without the need for strong cooperativity for relaxation .",
    "it is worth noting that interactions found in nature are numerous , but the models of asymptotic time dependence of relaxation commonly found in nature are limited in number .",
    "however , the parameters of the relaxation function depend on the form of the biasing potential and the nature of interaction between the carriers .",
