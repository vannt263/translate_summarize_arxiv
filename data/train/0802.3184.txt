    "the effect of disorder on polaritons has been extensively studied in the quantum well - microcavity case ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "it was found that if the potential fluctuations due to the disorder are comparable with the rabi splitting then the two polaritonic peaks disappear and one inhomogeneously broadened peak remains in the absorption spectrum .",

    "we are going to investigate a disordered planar lattice embedded in a planar microcavity structure .",
    "the role of the lattice is to localize excitons and the physical mechanism of localization will not be specified at this point . as discussed above , quantum dots , impurities , metal gates and optical lattices can be used to localized the exciton states .",
    "we further assume that only one excitonic level is present on each site , implying a strong localization .",
    "this also allows us to describe the exciton transfer process between sites using a tight - binding approach .",
    "the case of quantum dots has been extensively discussed in ref . .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian in second quantization ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the exciton creation operator on the @xmath4 site at position @xmath5 with energy @xmath6 and exciton - photon coupling @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the inter - site energy transfer between nearest neighbors sites , @xmath9 is the creation operator of the cavity photon mode with in - plane momentum @xmath10 and energy @xmath11 . by writing the coupling constant as @xmath12 we can analyze separately the disorder effect induced by position fluctuations and oscillator strength fluctuations .",
    "we assume that the distance between localization sites is much larger than the effective exciton localization length on each site .",
    "this justifies why fluctuations are site - uncorrelated . for energy fluctuations , defined as @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath14 being the average exciton energy , we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 indicates averaging over a gaussian ensemble .",
    "similarly , we have for the oscillator strength disorder @xmath18 where we assume @xmath19 with the characteristic size of the site@xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the on - site oscillator strength variance at @xmath23 .",
    "finally , we obtain for the positional disorder @xmath24 where the positions @xmath25 identify the ideal two dimensional lattice .",
    "furthermore , we assume for simplicity that the different kinds of disorder are uncorrelated .",
    "this allows us to treat them separately in the perturbation approach described below .",
    "we can separate the fluctuation - independent part of the hamiltonian by defining the fourier transform of the exciton operators as @xmath26 where @xmath25 corresponds to the @xmath4 site of a two dimensional ideal lattice and @xmath27 is the total number of sites .",
    "the sum over @xmath10 states is restricted to the first brillouin zone ( bz ) of the reciprocal lattice space .",
    "this fluctuation - independent hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a reciprocal lattice vector , @xmath30 is the renormalized coupling constant , and the exciton dispersion of a square lattice reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lattice constant .",
    "we can then define the disorder coupling constants @xmath33 where the index @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) indicates oscillator strength ( position ) disorder .",
    "the statistical properties of these functions are determined by their average value as @xmath36 and correlations according to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a reciprocal lattice vector and @xmath39 the disorder terms for the three different mechanisms can then be written in a compact form as @xmath40 we can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the disorder free hamiltonian by solving @xmath41 these are the disorder - free polariton states that can be written in the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a band index , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are hopfield coefficients,@xcite and @xmath46 is the exciton - photon vacuum .",
    "we can use these states and obtain an effective disorder potential for polaritons as @xmath47 where @xmath48 labels energy , oscillator strength , and positional disorder , respectively .",
    "this gives for the energy disorder @xmath49 and for the oscillator strength ( positional ) disorder @xmath50      the absorption spectrum at an angle determined by the inplane @xmath10 of the cavity photon can be calculated using the full propagator of the disordered system , which can be written in terms of the disorder - free polariton states as @xmath51 with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the green s function for disorder - free polaritons .",
    "@xmath54 is the scattering t - matrix that can be expressed as @xmath55 the imaginary part of the polariton propagator projected on a photon mode at a given wavevector @xmath56 gives the absorption spectrum at the corresponding emission angle as @xmath57 with @xmath58 we can explicitely average over the disorder configurations to obtain @xmath59 with @xmath60 in the case of disorder due to energy inhomogeneity , the ensemble averaging leads to the conservation of the momentum , @xmath61 , since the averaging selects only diagonal terms in eq .",

    "we note that this is the same as in the case of one particle scattering on an impurity ensemble.@xcite the diagonal elements of the @xmath54-matrix can be interpreted as an effective self - energy , @xmath62 and within the pole approximation @xmath63 , their real part gives a shift of the polariton levels .",
    "the shift can also be calculated using a direct perturbation theory approach as shown in the following section .      here",
    "we calculate the corrections to the energy up to the second order in the disordered potential , using the statistical properties of the disorder derived above .",
    "we start with the first order energy shift for all three kinds of disorder @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined in eq .",

    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    let us start with the effect of the energy disorder in the absorption spectra as shown in fig .",
    "[ figca ] .",
    "the disorder - free case ( black line ) shows lower ( lp ) and upper ( up ) polariton peaks with half - exciton and half - photon character .",
    "additionally , in the @xmath72-point case ( a ) , there is a central purely photonic peak .",
    "the polariton splitting , i.e. the energy difference between the lower and the upper polariton energy , is larger by @xmath80 mev at the @xmath74-point than at the @xmath72-point due to the stronger coupling in the normal direction .",
    "@xcite the disorder shifts the lp ( up ) energy : according to the perturbation theory the first order shift of the lp ( up ) is zero ( as seen from eq .",
    "( [ enave ] ) ) and the second order shift is negative ( positive ) , according to eq .",
    "( [ enave2 ] ) , and leads to an _ increase _ of the polariton splitting .",
    "therefore , a weak disorder can increase the robustness and visibility of the polariton splitting with respect to the ideal case .",
    "the fact that a weak exciton disorder increases the observability of a coherent effect may be seen as counter - intuitive , but it has been also found in similar contexts , e.g. in the exciton aharonov - bohm effect.@xcite additionally , by increasing disorder the up and lp peaks broaden . within the perturbative approach we find that the broadening of the polariton modes is equal to @xmath81 in the lowest order ( see eq .",
    "( [ envar ] ) ) , the second order being proportional to @xmath82 ( see eq .",
    "( [ envar2 ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , in order to check our perturbative approach we have also performed a direct comparison between the full numerical solution and the analytical result from perturbation theory for weak disorder , shown in fig .",
    "[ figd ] and an excellent agreement is found .    .",
    "40 realizations of energy disorder with variation @xmath83 mev on the lattice with @xmath84 sites were considered.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    notice that for both @xmath74 and @xmath72 polaritons , a new central very broad excitonic peak appears .",
    "however , in the @xmath72-point case a central peak corresponding to a pure photonic mode , clearly insensitive to the disorder , is superposed to the broad central excitonic background . as the width of the energy distribution due to the inhomogeneous energy disorder approaches the value of the lower and upper polariton splitting ,",
    "the three peaks merge and the spectrum consists of a central narrow ( photon - like ) peak and a broad excitonic background .    from an experimental point of view , state - of - the - art quantum dot samples have inhomogeneous broadening of several mev , which is comparable to typical values of the polariton splitting .",
    "this makes the observation of the polariton splitting challenging . on the other hand , impurities have very narrow energy distribution and the planar lattice can be realized by patterned ion - implantation methods .",
    "array of impurties with deep excitonic levels could be obtained by this method .",
    "assuming deep energy levels , frenkel - like excitons bound to impurities will have very small inhomogeneous energy broadening .",
    "nevertheless , using ion implantation , it is hard to control the number of impurities on every lattice site .",
    "thus , the lattice of impurities has a very narrow on - site energy distribution but large oscillator strength disorder due to impurity number fluctuation .",
    "the same kind of disorder may occur in atoms trapped in optical lattices . in order to investigate this effect",
    ", we consider a gaussian distribution of the exciton oscillator strength in the coupling constants @xmath85 .",
    "a poisson distribution is another possibility but we have not investigated that case .",
    "the absorption spectra for different oscillator strength disorder are shown in fig .",
    "[ figcb ] .",
    "the behaviour of the lp and up peaks for both @xmath74 and @xmath72-point is similar to the case of the energy disorder .",
    "in particular , we observe a decrease ( increase ) of lp ( up ) energy , which is again consistent with the perturbation theory as seen in eqs .",
    "( [ osave ] ) and ( [ osave2 ] ) .",
    "we also remark that even for very large fluctuations of the oscillator strength both the broadening and energy shift remain smaller with repect to the inhomogeneous energy disorder .",
    "finally , we have also investigated absorption spectra in the presence of positional disorder , i.e. deviations in the exciton localization sites from the ideal lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figcc ] . clearly , this disorder plays a role only for @xmath72-point polaritons , since the @xmath74-point does not probe the lattice symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ figcc]b ) .",
    "in contrast to the oscillator strength disorder and to the energy disorder , positional disorder leads to a blueshift ( redshift ) of the lower ( upper ) polariton peak , which implies a reduction of the polariton splitting .",
    "this is related to the fact that the first order perturbation theory is non - zero in this case , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ posavea ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of the central polariton ( cp ) peak is more complex .",
    "first , it splits into three lines for weak disorder .",
    "then the remaining central peak splits again into a doublet for stronger disorder .",
    "the first splitting can be understood easily taking into account cp s three - fold degeneracy@xcite at @xmath86 which is lifted in presence of disorder and consequently one energy shifts upwards ( downwards ) and one stays in the middle . with increasing strength of disorder",
    ", the state with @xmath86 mixes with neighboring @xmath10 and doublet appears .    moreover , assuming zero exciton transfer , no anylitical expressions can be derived because the cp is @xmath27-fold degenerate ( in the bz ) . on the other hand ,",
    "assuming a finite exciton transfer rate @xmath87 , the @xmath27-fold degeneracy decreases to a three - fold degeneracy at the @xmath72-point . since these levels are purely photonic , the first order matrix elements are zero and second order perturbation theory has to be used .",
    "the matrix elements of the second order effective hamiltonian read @xmath88 where @xmath89 the correction to the unperturbed energy is found by averaging the eigenvalues of @xmath90 , whichs can not be done analytically .",
    "a good approximation consists in averaging first the matrix elements @xmath91 before calculating the eigenvalues .",
    "we have shown that this approximation introduces errors of the fourth order in the disorder potential and gives good agreement with the exact numerical calculation .",
    "if the positional disorder is of the same order of the lattice constant , i.e. for @xmath92 , the lattice becomes close to a set of random sites . in this limit , instead of averaging the eigenvalues , the random phase @xmath93 in the coupling constants can be averaged first , which leads to a position independent value @xmath94 .",
    "this results in a @xmath74-point like spectrum with an upper and lower polariton as clearly shown for the strongest disorder in fig .",
    "[ figcc]a ( magenta ) .",
    "we have investigated numerically and analytically the role of disorder in structures consisting of a lattice of dots or impurities embedded in a planar microcavity .",
    "we have focused on bragg polaritons occurring at the brillouin zone boundary and we have shown that small energy disorder , i.e. diagonal disorder , with respect to the light - matter coupling is necessary to observe polariton features in the absorption spectra . moreover , we have found that polariton is very robust against oscillator strength and position disorder .",
    "our results show that a lattice consisting of deep impurities with frenkel excitons or atoms in an optical lattice structure are promising candidates for the experimental observation of the bragg polaritons ."
