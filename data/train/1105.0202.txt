    "this paper is in the lineage of the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , in which we studied and compared various metrics on teichmller spaces of surfaces of finite or of infinite topological type .",
    "the first important thing to know in that respect is that some definitions that are equivalent to each other in the teichmller theory of surfaces of finite type are no more equivalent in the setting of surfaces of infinite type . indeed , there are teichmller spaces that are associated to a surface of infinite type that are distinct ( in the set - theoretic sense ) and that would be equal if the same definitions were made in the case of a surface of finite type .",
    "furtermore , each such space associated to a surface of finite or of infinite type carries a natural distance function , and it is an interesting problem to study the relations between the various spaces , their distance functions and their topologies .",
    "it is necessary to have different names to the various spaces that arise , and we briefly recall the terminology .",
    "we use the name _ quasi - conformal teichmller space _ for the `` classical '' teichmller space defined using quasi - conformal mappings and equipped with its teichmller metric .    in the paper @xcite",
    ", we introduced the _ fenchel - nielsen teichmller space _ , a certain space of equivalence classes of complex structures on a surface , equipped with a distance , called the _ fenchel - nielsen distance _ ,",
    "defined using fenchel - nielsen coordinates .",
    "this teichmller space and its metric depend on the choice of a pair of pants decomposition of the surface .",
    "the fenchel - nielsen teichmller space was a fundamental tool in our work , because it has explicit coordinates and an explicit distance function , and we used it in the other papers mentioned to describe and understand the other teichmller spaces .",
    "one of the results obtained was that if the lengths of all the boundary curves of the pair of pants decomposition are bounded above by a uniform constant then there is a set - theoretic equality between the fenchel - nielsen teichmller space and the quasiconformal teichmller space .",
    "furthermore , the identity map between the two teichmller spaces , equipped with their respective metrics , is a locally bi - lipschitz homeomorphism .",
    "this gives an explicit description of the global topology and the local metric properties of the quasiconformal teichmller space .    in the paper @xcite",
    ", we obtained similar local comparison results between the fenchel - nielsen teichmller space and the so - called _ length spectrum teichmller space _",
    ", another deformation space of complex structures , whose definition and metric are based on the comparison of lengths of simple closed curves between surfaces .    in the cases of surfaces of finite type ,",
    "the various teichmller spaces coincide set - theretically , but there are still interesting questions on the local and global comparison of the metrics that are defined on these spaces .    in the present paper , we prove that under a change of the pair of pants decomposition , the identity map between the corresponding fenchel - nielsen teichmller spaces is not bi - lipschitz in general .",
    "this result holds for surfaces of finite and for those of infinite type .",
    "we first prove this result in the case where the surface is a torus with one hole or a sphere with four holes . in this case",
    ", the two pair of pants decompositions are obtained from each other by a single elementary move . the proof is based on explicit computations that use formulae obtained by okai in @xcite .",
    "we then deduce an analogous result for arbitrary surfaces of finite or of infinite type .    to state the theorems precisely , we now introduce some minimal amount of notation .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ section : preliminaries ] for more details .",
    "if @xmath4 is a surface equipped with a complex structure , we denote by @xmath5 the quasi - conformal teichmller space of @xmath4 , equipped with the quasi - conformal distance @xmath6 , and by @xmath7 the fenchel - nielsen teichmller space of @xmath4 with reference to the pair of pants decomposition @xmath0 , equipped with its associated fenchel - nielsen distance @xmath8 .    in section [ section :",
    "general_case ] we prove the following :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath2 be an orientable surface which is either of finite topological type of negative euler characteristic and which is not a pair of pants , or of infinite topological type .",
    "let @xmath0 be a pair of pants decomposition of @xmath2 .",
    "then we have the following :    1 .",
    "there exists another pair of pants decomposition @xmath9 such that for every base complex structure @xmath4 on @xmath2 we have @xmath10 as sets , but the identity map between the two spaces equipped with their fenchel - nielsen distances @xmath8 and @xmath11 respectively is not lipschitz .",
    "2 .   for every base complex structure",
    "@xmath4 on @xmath2 , consider the space @xmath12 . then the identity map from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is not lipschitz .",
    "if @xmath2 is of infinite topological type , there exists a base complex structure @xmath4 on @xmath2 and another pair of pants decomposition @xmath9 such that if @xmath15 is the space @xmath16 , then the identity map from @xmath13 to @xmath17 is not continuous .",
    "if @xmath2 is of infinite topological type , there exists a base complex structure @xmath4 on @xmath2 such that if @xmath15 is the space @xmath16 , then the identity map from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is not continuous .    from this result",
    ", we can see that the local comparison results we obtained in the papers @xcite and @xcite are optimal in the sense that they can not be extended to global comparison results , since the global metric geometry of the fenchel - nielsen distance depends on the choice of the pair of pants decomposition .",
    "in this section , we recall a few facts from our previous papers , which will help making the present paper self - contained .",
    "let @xmath2 be an orientable connected surface of finite or of infinite topological type , that can have punctures and/or compact boundary components .",
    "the complex structures that we consider on @xmath2 are such that each boundary component has a regular neighborhood that is bi - holomorphically equivalent to a bounded cylinder and each puncture has a neighborhood that is bi - holomorphically equivalent to a punctured disc .",
    "we start by reviewing the definition of the fenchel - nielsen metric on the teichmller space @xmath18 of @xmath2 .",
    "the definition depends on the choice of a pair of pants decomposition of @xmath2 .",
    "a pair of pants decomposition @xmath19 of @xmath2 is a decomposition into generalized pairs of pants glued along their boundary components , where a generalized pair of pants is a sphere with three holes , a hole being either a point removed ( leaving a puncture on the pair of pants ) or an open disc removed ( leaving a boundary component on the pair of pants ) .",
    "the curves @xmath20 in the above definition are the closed curves on @xmath2 ( including the boundary components ) that define the decomposition .",
    "it is well - known that every surface of finite topological type with negative euler characteristic admits a pair of pants decomposition .",
    "it also follows from the classification of surfaces of infinite type that every such surface admits a pair of pants decomposition @xcite .    to every complex structure on @xmath2",
    "we can associate a hyperbolic metric , called the _",
    "intrinsic _ metric , which was defined by bers in @xcite .",
    "this metric is conformally equivalent to the given complex structure , and every boundary curve is a geodesic for that metric .",
    "the definition of the intrinsic metric is recalled in @xcite . in the sequel , when we talk about geometric objects ( geodesics , length , angles , etc . ) associated to a complex structure on @xmath2 , it is understood that these are associated to the intrinsic metric on @xmath2 .",
    "a pair of pants decomposition @xmath21 of the surface @xmath2 equipped with its intrinsic metric is said to be _ geodesic _ if each @xmath20 is a geodesic closed curve in @xmath2 with respect to this metric .",
    "in @xcite we proved that every topological pair of pants decomposition of @xmath2 is homotopic to a unique geodesic pair of pants decomposition .",
    "( note that this is not true for general hyperbolic metrics on @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the poincar metric of @xmath2 may not satisfy this property if this metric is different from the intrinsic metric , and this may happen ; we discussed this fact in @xcite . )",
    "given a closed curve @xmath22 on the surface @xmath2 , we make the convention that we shall call also @xmath22 the unique geodesic representative of this closed curve with reference to the intrinsic metric .    given a complex structure @xmath1 on @xmath2 and a geodesic pair of pants decomposition @xmath21 of this surface , then for any closed geodesic @xmath23 there is a well - defined _ length parameter _",
    "@xmath24 , which is the length of this closed geodesic , and a _ twist parameter _",
    "@xmath25 , which is defined only if @xmath20 is not the homotopy class of a boundary component of @xmath2 .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is a measure of the relative twist amount along the geodesic @xmath20 between the two generalized hyperbolic pair of pants ( which might be the same ) having this geodesic in common . in this paper , the value @xmath25 is a signed distance - parameter , that is , it represents an amount of twisting in terms of a distance measured along the curve , as opposed to an angle of twisting parameter ( whose absolute value would vary by @xmath26 after a complete dehn twist ) .    for any complex structure @xmath1 on @xmath2 ,",
    "its _ fenchel - nielsen parameter _ relative to @xmath0 is a collection of pairs @xmath27 where it is understood that if @xmath20 is a boundary geodesic , then it has no associated twist parameter , and instead of a pair @xmath28 , we have a single parameter @xmath24",
    ".    given two complex structures @xmath1 and @xmath29 on @xmath2 , their _ fenchel - nielsen distance _ ( with respect to @xmath0 ) is defined as    @xmath30    again with the convention that if @xmath20 is a boundary component of @xmath2 and therefore has no associated twist parameter , we consider only the first factor .    if @xmath2 is a surface of finite topological type , then @xmath31 is always finite , and the function @xmath32 defines a distance on the teichmller space of @xmath2 , which we will denote simply by @xmath18 . if , instead , @xmath2 is of infinite topological type , @xmath31 can assume the value infinity .",
    "in this case we fix a base complex structure @xmath4 on @xmath2 , and we define the fenchel - nielsen teichmller space of @xmath4 as the set of homotopy classes of complex structures @xmath1 on @xmath2 such that @xmath33 is finite .",
    "we denote this space by @xmath34 .",
    "the function @xmath32 is a distance function in the usual sense on this space , and it makes it isometric to the sequence space @xmath35 .    when it is important to stress on the dependence on a given pair of pants decomposition @xmath0 , we shall denote the teichmller space by @xmath7 ( this dependence of the space on @xmath0 may happen only for surfaces of infinite type ) , and the fenchel - nielsen distance by @xmath8 ( the distance function depends on @xmath0 also for a surface of finite type ) .",
    "if a pair of pants decomposition @xmath0 is obtained from another pair of pants decomposition @xmath36 by a finite number of elementary moves ( represented in figures [ torus ] and [ sphere1 ] below ) , then for any basepoint @xmath4 we have the set - theoretic equality @xmath37 .    in the last section of this paper",
    "we will prove that for every surface @xmath2 , there exist two pair of pants decompositions @xmath38 such that for every base complex structure @xmath4 , the fenchel - nielsen teichmller spaces are the same ( that is , we have a set - theoretical equality @xmath37 ) , but the identity map between the two spaces is not lipschitz with reference to the two fenchel - nielsen distances @xmath8 and @xmath39 .",
    "in this section , the surface @xmath40 is a torus with one hole , where the hole can be either a boundary component or a puncture .",
    "a pair of pants decomposition of @xmath2 is determined by a unique simple closed curve on @xmath2 which is not homotopic to a point or to the hole .",
    "we consider two distinct pair of pants decomposition @xmath41 and @xmath42 of @xmath2 defined by two essential simple closed curves @xmath43 and @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 , as represented in figure [ torus ] .",
    "let @xmath1 be a complex structure on @xmath2 , equipped with its intrinsic hyperbolic metric . at the hole",
    ", @xmath1 can have geodesic boundary , and in this case we denote by @xmath46 its length , or it can have a cusp , and in this case we write @xmath47 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the length and twist parameters of the curve @xmath43 , for the decomposition @xmath41 , and by @xmath49 the length and twist parameters of the curve @xmath44 , for the decomposition @xmath42 .",
    "we need a formula relating these values .",
    "this was done by okai ( @xcite ) in the case where the hole is a boundary component , but we also need similar formulae for the case of a cusp . in the following proposition",
    "we obtain this with a continuity argument . in these formulae ,",
    "the case where @xmath50 means that at the hole the surface has a cusp .",
    "[ prop : okaicusps ] with the above notation we have , for all @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54    when @xmath55 , these formulae are proved in @xcite . to see that they also hold when @xmath47 ( the case of a cusp ) we use",
    "the shear coordinates relative to an ideal triangulation .",
    "we recall that in the case of a torus with one hole equipped with a complex structure ( and the corresponding intrinsic metric ) , an ideal triangulation has three edges , say @xmath56 , and associated to every edge there is a real number , called the shear parameter .",
    "thus , we have three numbers , @xmath57 .",
    "the boundary length @xmath46 can be read from the shear coordinates : @xmath58 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.4.21 ) ) , and the cusp corresponds to the case where @xmath59 .",
    "here we need the property that the parameters @xmath60 can also be written as continuous functions of the shear coordinates . to see this",
    "one can show that for every element @xmath61 of the fundamental group of the surface , the coefficients of the matrix corresponding to @xmath61 in the holonomy representation can be written as continuous functions of the shear coordinates .",
    "the length of the corresponding closed geodesic in the surface is a continuous function of the trace of this matrix , hence all simple closed curve lengths are continuous functions of the shear coordinates . for the twist parameters",
    ", we note that their absolute values can be written as a continuous function of the lengths of some simple closed curves .    to show that the above formulae are valid for @xmath47",
    ", we just need to note that both the left hand side and the right hand side of the equations are continuous functions of the shear coordinates .",
    "it is known that shear coordinates extend to the case of surfaces with cusps ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) ) , see also @xcite ) .",
    "then as these functions are equal when @xmath55 , i.e. when @xmath62 , and as this subset is dense in the space of shear coordinates , these functions are equal everywhere , that is , including the case where @xmath47 .    for simplicity ,",
    "we choose a complex structure @xmath1 on the torus with one hole such that its intrinsic metric has the property that the two closed geodesics in the homotopy classes of @xmath43 and @xmath44 meet perpendicularly .",
    "to see that such a choice is possible , we can start with an arbitrary complex structure on @xmath2 ( equipped with its intrinsic metric ) and we cut this surface along the closed geodesic @xmath43 ; in this way @xmath44 is cut into an essential geodesic arc , which is homotopic to a unique geodesic arc @xmath63 that is perpendicular to the two boundary components of @xmath64 that arise from cutting the surface along @xmath43 .",
    "then we glue back the two components in such a way that in the resulting surface the two endpoints of @xmath63 match .",
    "we obtain a complex structure with the desired property .",
    "such a complex structure corresponds to the case @xmath65 in the notation of okai @xcite .    performing a fenchel - nielsen twist of magnitude @xmath66 along @xmath43",
    ", we obtain from @xmath1 a new complex structure @xmath67 that has fenchel - nielsen coordinates denoted by @xmath68 in the coordinate system associated to @xmath41 and @xmath69 in the coordinate system associated to @xmath42 .",
    "the coordinates of the complex structure @xmath1 that we have chosen are @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the bases @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "since @xmath67 is obtained by a time-@xmath66 twist along the curve @xmath43 , we have @xmath72 for all @xmath66 .",
