    "let @xmath1 and @xmath3 be as in the above paragraph .",

    "( we mean all curves , including those passing through vertices of @xmath1 ; in fact , it suffices to restrict oneself to curves that intersect the graph only in vertices . )",
    "this concept has received a lot of attention in the literature ; we refer to  @xcite for more information .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is _ minor - minimal @xmath2-representative _ if @xmath1 is @xmath2-representative , has no isolated vertices and for every edge @xmath14 of @xmath1 the embedded graphs obtained from @xmath1 by deleting and contracting @xmath14 are no longer @xmath2-representative .",
    "( one could also define a related concept where we say that no proper minor of @xmath1 , taken as an abstract graph , has a @xmath2-representative embedding in @xmath6 . for @xmath15",
    "these two notions coincide , but we use the former definition . ) randby  @xcite proved that given two minor - minimal @xmath2-representative graphs in @xmath16 , each can be obtained from the other by means of repeated application of @xmath17- and @xmath18-exchanges .",
    "since for each @xmath2 there is a natural example of a minor - minimal @xmath2-representative projective plane graph , namely the @xmath19 projective grid , randby s result gives a convenient way to generate all minor - minimal @xmath2-representative projective plane graphs .",

    "computing branch - width is np - hard  @xcite , but there is a polynomial time algorithm when @xmath3 is planar  @xcite .",
    "thus one might expect that planar branch - width is better behaved in other respects as well , such as in terms of excluded minors . since taking minors does not increase branch - width , as is easily seen , graphs of branch - width at most @xmath33 are characterized by _ excluded minors _ , the list of minor - minimal graphs of branch - width @xmath34 .",
    "it follows from  @xcite that this list is finite .",
    "our first result is that planar double covers of minor - minimal @xmath2-representative projective plane graphs are excluded minors for odd branch - width :    [ main thm ] let @xmath35 be an integer , let @xmath1 be a minor - minimal @xmath2-representative projective plane graph , and let @xmath3 be the double cover of @xmath1 .",
