    "hadron interactions are strong and , in principle , should be described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "however , experimental data show that their main features originate from the non - perturbative sector of qcd . only the comparatively rare processes with high transferred momenta can be treated theoretically rather successfully by the perturbative methods due to the well - known property of the asymptotical freedom of qcd .",
    "thus , in absence of methods for rigorous solution of qcd equations , our understanding of the dynamics of the main bulk of strong interactions is severely limited by the model building or some rare rigorous relations .",
    "in fact , our approach to high energy hadronic processes at present is at best still in its infancy .    from experiment",
    "we have learned , at least , about five subregions of the elastic scattering differential cross section . here",
    ", we discuss only two of them : the diffraction cone and the orear regime .",
    "the diffraction cone at small angles reminds the quasiclassical effects with gaussian decrease in angles .",
    "the region at larger angles with exponential decrease of the cross section called orear region became noticeable only at energies of colliding particles above several gev .",
    "it persists till present lhc energies of 7 and 8 tev .",
    "the extended review was earlier published in @xcite .",
    "the sections 2 and 3 are the abbreviated versions of its corresponding parts .",
    "others present some results obtained later .",
    "the measurement of the differential cross section is the only source of the experimental information about their elastic scattering .",
    "herefrom , the main characteristics of hadron interactions directly related to the elastic scattering amplitude such as the total cross section , the elastic scattering cross section , the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the amplitude , the slope of the diffraction cone etc are obtained .",
    "the first two of them are functions of the total energy only , while others depend on two variables - the total energy and the transferred momentum ( or the scattering angle ) .",
    "the dimensionless elastic scattering amplitude @xmath0 defines the differential cross section in a following way : @xmath1 here , the ratio of the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude has been defined @xmath2 in what follows , we consider the very high energy processes .",
    "therefore , the masses of the colliding particles may be neglected , and one uses the expression @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energy and the momentum in the center of mass system .",
    "the four - momentum transfer squared is @xmath6 with @xmath7 denoting the scattering angle in the center of mass system and @xmath8 the transverse momentum .",
    "the elastic scattering cross section is given by the integral of the differential cross section ( [ dsel ] ) over all transferred momenta : @xmath9    the total cross section @xmath10 is related by the optical theorem with the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude at high energy @xmath11 as @xmath12    elastically scattered hadrons escape from the interaction region declining mostly at quite small angles within the so - called diffraction cone . therefore the main attention has been paid to this region . as known from experiment , the diffraction peak has a gaussian shape in the scattering angles or exponentially decreasing as the function of the transferred momentum squared : @xmath13 in view of the relations ( [ sel ] ) , ( [ sigt ] ) , ( [ diff ] ) , any successful theoretical description of the differential distribution must succeed in fits of the energy dependence of the total and elastic cross sections as well .    the diffraction cone slope @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 .",

    "the function @xmath33 represents the shadowing contribution of the inelastic processes to the elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "following @xcite it is called the overlap function .",
    "it determines the shape of the diffraction peak and is completely non - perturbative .",
    "only some phenomenological models pretend to describe it .    in the forward direction @xmath34=0",
    "this relation in combination with the optical theorem ( [ sigt ] ) reduces to the general statement that the total cross section is the sum of cross sections of elastic and inelastic processes : @xmath35    the unitarity relation ( [ unit ] ) has been successfully used @xcite for the model - independent description of the orear region between the diffraction cone and hard parton scattering which became the crucial test for phenomenological models .",
    "experimentally , all characteristics of elastic scattering are measured as functions of energy @xmath11 and transferred momentum @xmath16 . however , it is appealing to get knowledge about the geometrical structure of scattered particles and the role of different space regions in the scattering process",
    ". then one should use the fourier - bessel transform to get correspondence between the transferred momenta and these space regions .",
    "the transverse distance between the centers of colliding particles called as the impact parameter @xmath36 determines the effective transferred momenta @xmath16 .",
    "the amplitudes in the corresponding representations are related as @xmath37 peripheral collisions at large @xmath38 lead to small transferred momenta @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath39 may be connected to the eikonal phase @xmath40 and to the opaqueness ( or blackness ) @xmath41 at the impact parameter @xmath36 by the fourier - bessel transformation @xmath42    assuming @xmath41 to be real and using eq .",
    "( [ sigt ] ) one gets @xmath43 also @xmath44 and @xmath45    to apply the inverse transformation one must know the amplitude @xmath39 at all transferred momenta .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to continue it analytically to the unphysical region of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this may be done @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the mathematically consistent inverse formulae contain , in general , the sum of contributions from the physical and unphysical parts of the amplitude @xmath39 .",
    "the amplitude in ( [ unit ] ) enters only in the physical region .",
    "only this part of its fourier - bessel transform is important in the unitarity relation for the impact parameter representation as well .",
    "it is written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are obtained by the direct transformation of @xmath39 and @xmath49 integrated only over the physical transferred momenta from @xmath50 to 0 .",
    "they show the dependence of the intensity of elastic and inelastic interactions on the mutual impact parameter of the colliding particles .",
    "the integrals over all impact parameter values in this relation represent analogously to the relation ( [ tein ] ) the total , elastic and inelastic cross - sections , respectively",
    ".    however , the accuracy of the unitarity condition in @xmath38-representation ( [ unib ] ) is still under discussion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) since some corrections due to unphysical region enter there even though their role may be negligible .",
    "first , let us discuss what we can say about asymptotic properties of such fundamental characteristics as the total cross section @xmath10 , the elastic cross section @xmath51 , the ratio of the real part to the imaginary part of the elastic amplitude @xmath52 and the width of diffraction peak @xmath14 at infinite energies .",
    "then we compare this with some trends of present experimental data .",
    "more than half a century ago it was claimed @xcite that according to the general principles of the field theory and ideas about hadron interactions the total cross section can not increase with energy faster than @xmath53 .",
    "the upper bound was recently improved @xcite with the coefficient in front of the logarithm shown to be twice smaller than in the earlier limit : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a pion mass .",
    "if estimated at present energies , this bound is still much higher than the experimentally measured values of the cross sections with @xmath56=1 gev@xmath19 chosen as a `` natural '' scale .",
    "therefore it is of the functional significance .",
    "it forbids extremely fast growth of the total cross section exceeding asymptotically the above limits .",
    "both the coefficient in front of logarithm in ( [ asymp ] ) and the constancy of @xmath56 are often questioned . in particular , some possible dependence of @xmath56 on energy @xmath11 is proclaimed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty relation points out that such a regime favors the exponentially bounded space profile of the distribution of matter density @xmath57 in colliding particles of the type @xmath58 .",
    "since the energy density is @xmath59 and there should be at least one created particle with mass @xmath60 in the overlap region , then the condition @xmath61 gives rise to @xmath62 and , consequently , to the functional dependence of ( [ asymp ] ) .",
    "it was namely heisenberg who first proposed earlier just such a behavior of total cross sections @xcite .",
    "he considered the pion production processes in proton - proton collisions as a shock wave problem governed by some non - linear field - theoretical equations .    to study asymptotics ,",
    "some theoretical arguments based on general principles of field theory and analogy of strong interactions to massive quantum electrodynamics @xcite were promoted .",
    "the property that the limits @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 denotes the photon mass ) commute has been used @xcite , i.e. the asymptotics of strong interactions coincides with the massless limit of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "these studies led to the general geometrical picture of the two hadrons interacting as lorentz - contracted black disks at asymptotically high energies ( see also the review paper @xcite ) . in what follows , we discuss some other possibilities as well .",
    "however , as a starting point for further reference , we describe the predictions of this proposal .",
    "the main conclusions are :    \\1 . for black ( @xmath66 ) and logarithmically expanding disks with finite radii @xmath67 ( @xmath68=const )",
    "one gets from ( [ cstb ] ) that @xmath10 approaches infinity at asymptotics as @xmath69    \\2 .",
    "the elastic and inelastic processes should contribute on equal footing @xmath70 this quantum - mechanical result differs from `` intuitive''@xmath71 classical predictions .",
    "the width of the diffraction peak @xmath72 should shrink because its slope increases as @xmath73    \\4 .",
    "the forward ratio of the real part to the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath23 must vanish asymptotically as @xmath74 this result follows directly from eq .",

    "these are merely a few conclusions among many model dependent ones",
    ".    none of these asymptotical predictions were yet observed in experiment .",
    "surely , there is another more realistic at present energies possibility that the black disk model is too extreme and the gray fringe always exists .",
    "it opens the way to the numerous speculations with many new parameters about the particle shape and opacity ( see the list of references in @xcite ) .    in the table 1",
    "we show the predictions of the gray disk model with the steep rigid edge described by the heaviside step - function and the gaussian disk model .",
    "@xmath82 is the diffraction profile function .    the slope @xmath14 is completely determined by the size of the interaction region @xmath67 .",
    "other characteristics are sensitive to the blackness of disks @xmath83 .",
    "in particular , the ratio @xmath84 is proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "the ratio @xmath85 plays an important role for fits at larger angles .",

    "the value of @xmath85 approaches fast its limit for the gaussian distribution of matter in the disk .",
    "this shows that the above crude models are not very bad for qualitative estimates in a first approximation .",
    "we briefly comment on some of the important general trends of high - energy data observed in experiment .",
    "total cross sections increase with energy . at present energies ,",
    "the power - like approximation is the most preferable one .",
    "the ratio @xmath93 decreases from low energies to those of isr where it becomes approximately equal to 0.17 and then strongly increases up to 0.25 at the lhc energies . however , it is still pretty far from the asymptotical value 0.5 corresponding to the black disk limit .",
    "the diffraction peak shrinks about twice from energies about @xmath94 gev where @xmath95 gev@xmath96 to the lhc energy where @xmath97 gev@xmath96 .",

    "as regards the behavior of the differential cross section in the function of the transverse momentum behind the dip , the @xmath16-exponential of the diffraction peak is replaced , according to experimental data , by the @xmath98-exponential at the intermediate angles : @xmath99 the slope @xmath100 in this region increases with energy and it shifts to lower @xmath101 .    \\6 . as a function of energy ,",
    "the ratio @xmath23 increases from negative values at comparatively low energies , crosses zero in the region of hundreds gev and becomes positive at higher energies where it passes through the maximum of about 0.14 and becomes smaller ( about 0.11 ) at lhc energies .",

    "the total cross section @xmath10 increases faster than @xmath78 decreases .    from the geometrical point of view",
    "the general picture is that protons become blacker , edgier and larger ( bel ) @xcite .",

    "the ocd - inspired models .",
    "their detailed review is given in @xcite .",
    "here , we restrict ourselves by several recent developments not included or discussed there very briefly .",
    "since old days , it was clear that hadrons possess some internal structure .",
    "namely this we discussed with pomeranchuk after i proposed the one - pion exchange model of inelastic interactions @xcite .",
    "it was treated as describing the peripheral interactions of hadrons .",
    "the deeper inside the hadron , the more pions should be exchanged and more dense populated should be the proton . since then , the principal features have not been changed with pions replaced by partons ( quarks and gluons ) even though pions as a chiral anomaly play the distinguished role .",
    "early attempts to consider elastic scattering of hadrons also stemmed from the analogous simple geometrical treatment of their internal structure @xcite . starting from simplified pictures , one tried to fit the elastic differential cross section .",
    "however , recent fits of lhc data failed outside the diffraction cone as demonstrated above .",
    "thus these hypotheses were not precise enough .    at the same time , one can get the direct knowledge about the proton structure important for _ inelasic _ collisions using elastic scattering data .",
    "the impact of the proton structure on inelastic processes can be viewed from the overlap function defined by the unitarity condition in @xmath38-representation ( [ unib ] ) for elastic scattering amplitudes .",

    "the theoretical explanation of the new regime of exponential decrease of the differential cross section beyond the diffraction cone with angles based on consequences of the unitarity condition in the @xmath11-channel has been proposed in refs @xcite .",
    "the careful fit to experimental data showed good quantitative agreement with experiment @xcite . nowadays",
    "the same approach helped explain the totem findings @xcite .",
    "we consider the lefthand side and the integral term @xmath135 in the unitarity condition ( [ unit ] ) at the angles @xmath7 outside the diffraction peak .",
    "because of the sharp fall off of the amplitude with angle , the principal contribution to the integral arises from a narrow region around the line @xmath136 .",

    "most of the widely used models do not predict such values .",
    "moreover many of them get it positive .",
    "this follows from the equal numbers of zeros of real and imaginary parts .",
    "only those models with odd sum of this number can succeed in getting negative @xmath120",

    "<S> when colliding , the high energy hadrons can either produce new particles or scatter elastically without change of their quantum numbers and other particles produced . </S>",
    "<S> namely elastic scatterings of hadrons are considered in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the general machinery of their theoretical treatment is described . </S>",
    "<S> some new experimental data are presented and confronted to phenomenological approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the internal structure of hadrons is the main subject of these studies . </S>",
    "<S> its impact on properties of their interactions is reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that protons become larger and darker with increase of their collision energy and reveal some substructure . </S>",
    "<S> the violation of the geometric scaling in the diffraction cone and new problems of description of differential cross sections outside it are described .    * hadron structure and elastic scattering *    * prelude . *    </S>",
    "<S> it was in september 1954 when i met pomeranchuk . </S>",
    "<S> he lectured theory of relativity . </S>",
    "<S> next year he became a tutor of our `` theoretical group '' . in some time he proposed me to learn the book of fl \" ugge on nuclear physics . after struggling with difficult subject written in german </S>",
    "<S> i asked him some questions . </S>",
    "<S> he liked it and one by one proposed several problems to be solved . in parallel , he insisted on passing through the series of famous landau exams . </S>",
    "<S> it was a good school . </S>",
    "<S> its lessons i described in the book of reminiscences about pomeranchuk . as a supervisor , he advised my diploma paper to be published in jetp letters and recommended me to prof . </S>",
    "<S> tamm as a phd student . </S>",
    "<S> soon i proposed the one - pion exchange model which was later extended to multiperipheral and multireggeon models . </S>",
    "<S> pomeranchuk got interested in it and asked me to come for discussion . </S>",
    "<S> he was deeply interested in properties of hadron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> our contacts lasted till his death .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i describe some new findings about elastic scattering of hadrons studied now up to lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> i briefly reviewed this at the pomeranchuk centennial seminar at itep . </S>",
    "<S> this would be extremely interesting subject for him . </S>",
    "<S> let me just mention pomeron and famous pomeranchuk theorem to remind you his basic contributions in this field . </S>",
    "<S> i dedicate the paper to the memory of my teacher isaak pomeranchuk . </S>"
