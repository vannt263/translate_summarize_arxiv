    "recently a number of difficulties in uniting accelerator and cosmic ray values of hadronic cross - sections within the frame of the highest up - to - date data have been summarized @xcite .",
    "such united picture appears to be highly important for at least , the interpretation of results of new cosmic ray experiments , as the hires @xcite and in designing proposals that are currently in progress , as the auger observatory @xcite , as well as in designing detectors for future accelerators , as the cern pp large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "although most of accelerator measurements of @xmath3 and @xmath4 at center of mass energy @xmath5 @xmath6 1.8 tev are quite consistent among them , this is unfortunately not the case for cosmic ray experiments at @xmath7 tev where some disagreements exist among different experiments .",
    "this is also the case among different predictions from the extrapolation of accelerator data up to cosmic ray energies : whereas some works predict smaller values of @xmath4 than those of cosmic ray experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) other predictions agree at some specific energies with cosmic ray results ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "dispersion of cosmic ray results are mainly associated to the strong model - dependence of the relation between the basic hadron - hadron cross - section and the hadronic cross - section in air .",
    "the later determines the attenuation lenght of hadrons in the atmosphere , which is usually measured in different ways , and depends strongly on the rate ( @xmath8 ) of energy dissipation of the primary proton into the electromagnetic shower observed in the experiment : such a cascade is simulated by different monte carlo techniques implying additional discrepancies between different experiments .",
    "furthermore , @xmath4 in cosmic ray experiments is determined from @xmath9 using a nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude which is frequently in disagreement with most of accelerator data @xcite . on the other hand , we dispose of parameterizations ( purely theoretically , empirical or semi - empirical based ) that fit pretty well the accelerator data .",
    "most of them agree that at the energy of the lhc ( 14 tev in the center of mass ) or higher ( extrapolations ) the rise in energy of @xmath4 will continue , though the predicted values differ from model to model .",
    "we claim that both the cosmic ray and parameterization approaches must complement each other in order to draw the best description of the hadronic cross - section behavior at ultra high energies .",
    "however , the present status is that due to the fact that interpolation of accelerator data is nicely obtained with most of parameterization models , it is expected that their extrapolation to higher energies be highly confident : as a matter of fact , parameterizations are usually based in a short number of fundamental parameters , in contrast with the difficulties found in deriving @xmath4 from cosmic ray results @xcite .",
    "if extrapolation from parameterization models is correct this would imply that @xmath9 should be smaller , which would have important consequences for development of high energy cascades .    with the aim of contributing to the understanding of this problem , in this paper we first briefly analyze in the first two sections the way estimations",
    "are done for proton - proton total cross sections from accelerators as well as from cosmic rays .",
    "we find serious discrepancies among both estimations . in the third section , on the basis of the multiple diffraction model applied to accelerator data , we predict @xmath10 total cross section values with smaller errors than with the standard techniques . we conclude with a discussion about the quality of present cosmic ray estimations .",
    "since the first results of the intersecting storage rings(isr ) at cern arrived in the 70s , it is a well established fact that @xmath4 rises with energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cern @xmath12 collider found this rising valid for @xmath3 as well @xcite .",
    "later , the tevatron confirmed that for @xmath3 the rising still continues at 1.8 tev , even if there is a disagreement among the diferent experiment values as for the exact value ( @xcite ) .",
    "a thoroughful discussion on these problems may be found in @xcite .",
    "it remains now to estimate the amount of rising of the total cross section at those energies .",
    "let us resume the standard technique used by accelerator experimentalists @xcite .    using a semi - empirical parameterization based on regge theory and asymptotic theorems experimentalists",
    "have succesively described their data from the isr to the @xmath12 energies .",
    "it takes into account all the available data for @xmath4 , @xmath13 , @xmath3 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , is the real part of the ( @xmath16 ) forward elastic amplitude at @xmath17 .",
    "the fits are performed using the once - subtracted dispersion relations : @xmath18\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the substraction constant .",
    "the expression for @xmath20 is : @xmath21^{\\gamma}\\ ] ] where - ( + ) stands for @xmath10 ( @xmath22 ) scattering .",
    "cross sections are measured in mb and energy in gev , e being the energy measured in the lab frame .",
    "the scale factor @xmath23 have been arbitrarily chosen equal to 1 gev@xmath24 .",
    "the most interesting piece is the one controling the high - energy behaviour , given by a @xmath25 term , in order to be compatible , asymptotically , with the froissart - martin bound @xcite .",
    "the parameterization assumes @xmath4 and @xmath3 to be the same asymptotically .",
    "this is justified from the very precise measurement of the @xmath26 parameter at 546 gev @xcite .",
    "the eight free parameters are determined by a fit which minimizes the @xmath27 function @xmath28 the fit has proved its validity predicting from the isr data ( ranging from 23 to 63 gev in the center of mass ) , the @xmath3 value later found at the @xmath12 collider , one order of magnitude higher in energy ( 546 gev ) @xcite . with the same well - known technique and using the most recent results it is possible to get estimations for @xmath4 at the lhc and higher energies .",
    "these estimations , together with our present experimental knowledge for both @xmath4 and @xmath3 are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "we have also plotted the cosmic ray experimental data from akeno ( now agassa ) @xcite and the fly s eye experiment @xcite .",
    "the curve is the result of the fit described in @xcite .",
    "the increase in @xmath4 as the energy increases is clearly seen .",
    "numerical predictions from this analysis are given in table 1 .",
    "it should be remarked that at the lhc energies and beyond the fitting results display relatively high error values , equal or bigger than 8 mb .",
    "we conclude that it is necessary to look for ways to reduce the errors and make the extrapolations more precise .",
    ".@xmath3 data from high energy accelerators : fits values are from [ 5 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it has been shown in this work that highly confident predictions of high energy @xmath4 values are strongly dependent on the energy range covered by experimental data and the available number of those data values . in",
    "particularly , we show that if we limit our study of determining @xmath4 at cosmic ray energies from extrapolation of accelerator data of @xmath29 gev , then results are compatible with most of cosmic ray experiments and other prediction models , because the predicted error band is so wide that covers their corresponding error bands ( fig .",
    "however , as x the included data in our calculations extends to higher energies , that is , when all experimental available data is taken into account , the estimated values for @xmath4 obtained from extrapolation and those obtained from cosmic ray experiments are only compatible , within the error bars , with the akeno results ( fig .",
    "it should be noted that our predictions are compatibles with other prediction studies @xcite .",
    "taken all these convergences at face value , as indicating the most probable @xmath4 value , we conclude that if predictions from accelerator data are correct , hence , it should be of great help to normalize the corresponding values from cosmic ray experiments , as for instance by keeping the ( @xmath8 ) parameter as a free one , as it is done for instance in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 value found will greatly help the tunning of the complicated monte carlo calculations used to evaluate the development of the showers induced by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere . in summary , extrapolations from accelerator data should be used to constraint cosmic ray estimations .",
