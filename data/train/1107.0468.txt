    "a conventional approach to nonlinear electromagnetic scattering problems is based on the power series expansion in a nonlinear susceptibility @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for the 2nd order susceptibility , the physical parameter that determines nonlinear effects is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electric field at the scattering structure .",
    "the smallness of @xmath3 justifies the use of perturbation theory and the solution is analytic in @xmath0 .",
    "the situation is different if the scattering structure has resonances .",
    "planar periodic structures ( e.g. , gratings ) are known to exhibit sharp scattering resonances when illuminated by electromagnetic waves ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it is known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that in such structures a local electromagnetic field @xmath2 is amplified if the structure has narrow resonances : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the amplitude of the incident wave and @xmath6 is the width of the resonance . consequently ,",
    "optical nonlinear effects are amplified if the system has a sufficiently narrow resonance . for example , an amplification of the second harmonics generation by a single periodic array of dielectric cylinders @xcite and by other single - array periodic systems @xcite have been reported , but no significant flux conversion rate , comparable to that in conventional methods of second harmonic generation , has been found . owing to the smallness of @xmath0 and a _ finite _ @xmath7 , the condition @xmath8 still holds for the studied structures .",
    "if two identical planar periodic structures are aligned parallel and separated by a distance @xmath9 , then it can be shown that for each resonance associated with the single structure , the combined structure has two close resonances whose width depends continuously on @xmath10 so that the width of one of the resonances vanishes , i.e. , @xmath11 as @xmath12 for some discrete set of distances @xmath13 , for sufficiently large @xmath10   @xcite .",
    "this means that the system has _",
    "bound states in the radiation continuum_. their existence was first predicted in quantum mechanics by von neumann and wigner @xcite in 1929 and later they were discovered in some atomic systems @xcite ( see also @xcite for more theoretical studies ) .",
    "their analog in maxwell s theory has only attracted attention recently @xcite . in particular , for a system of two parallel arrays of periodically positioned subwavelength dielectric cylinders ( depicted in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , the existence of bound states in the radiation continuum has been first established in numerical studies of the system @xcite .",
    "a complete classification of bound states as well as their analytic form for this system is given in @xcite for tm polarization .",
    "it is also shown @xcite that bound states exist in the spectral range in which more than one diffraction channel are open . from the physical point of view , bound states in the radiation continuum are localized solutions of maxwell s equations like waveguide modes , but in contrast to the latter their spectrum lies in the spectrum of scattering radiation ( diffraction ) modes .",
    "the perturbation theory parameter @xmath14 , as defined above , can no longer be considered small if bound states in the radiation continuum are present .",
    "this qualitative assessment should be taken with a precaution . in the present study",
    ", a rigorous analysis of the nonlinear scattering problem by means of the formalism of siegert states ( appropriately extended to periodic structures @xcite ) shows that no divergence of a local field occurs as @xmath12 .",
    "however , the conventional perturbative approach fails because the solution is not analytic in @xmath0 .",
    "the situation can be compared with a simple mechanical analog . consider a scattering problem for a particle on a line in a hard core repulsive potential @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "no matter how small @xmath17 is , the particle never crosses the origin @xmath18 and a full reflection occurs , but it does so when @xmath19 ( a full transmission ) .",
    "so , the scattering amplitude is not analytic in @xmath17 .",
    "other , more sophisticated , examples of quantum systems with such properties are studied in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present study is twofold .",
    "first , the nonlinear scattering problem is studied in _",
    "the presence of bound states in the radiation continuum_. a non - perturbative approach is developed to solve the problem .",
    "second , as an application of the developed formalism , the problem of the second harmonic generation is analyzed with an example of the system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( panel ( a ) ) .      in section  [ sec:1 ] , the nonlinear resonant scattering problem with bound states in the radiation continuum",
    "is transformed into a system of integral equations .",
    "a non - perturbative method is proposed to solve these equations in the approximation that takes into account two nonlinear effects : a second harmonic generation in the leading order of @xmath0 , and the fundamental harmonic generation by mixing the second and fundamental harmonics in the leading order in @xmath20 .",
    "this is the second order effect in @xmath0 known in the theory as the _",
    "optical rectification_. the latter is shown to be necessary to ensure the energy flux conservation .",
    "the formalism is illustrated with an example of two parallel periodic arrays of dielectric cylinders shown in panel ( a ) of fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the analysis is based on the subwavelength approximation ( section  [ sec:2 ] ) when the incident wave length is larger than the radius @xmath21 of the cylinders .",
    "if @xmath22 is the magnitude of the wave vector , then the theory has three small parameters : @xmath23 where all the distances are measured in units of the structure period , in particular @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the scattering phase for a single cylinder , @xmath26 is the linear dielectric susceptibility , and the amplitude of the incident wave is set to one , @xmath27 . with this choice of units ,",
    "all three parameters are dimensionless .",
    "the scattering amplitudes of the fundamental and second harmonics are explicitly found in section  [ sec:3 ] .    in section  [ sec:4 ] , it is shown that the ratio of the flux of the second harmonic along the normal direction and the incident flux is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fundamental field on the cylinders , and @xmath30 is some function . the function @xmath2 is _ non - analytic _ in the vicinity of zero values of its arguments .",
    "the non - perturbative approach of section  [ sec:1 ] is used to prove that the generated flux of the second harmonic attains its maximal value when the small parameters satisfy the condition @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a numerical constant , and @xmath33 is the magnitude of the wave vector of the bound state that occurs at @xmath34 . under this condition ,",
    "@xmath35 becomes analytic in the scattering phase @xmath36 so that in the leading order , @xmath37 an interesting feature to note is the independence of the conversion efficiency on the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath0 ( in the leading order in the scattering phase @xmath36 ) . in other words , given a nonlinear susceptibility @xmath0 , by a fine tuning of the distance between the arrays one can always reach the maximal value which is only determined by the scattering phase at the wave length of a bound state .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath33 for the system considered occurs just below the first diffraction threshold ( the wavelength is slightly larger than the structure period ) @xcite , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "taking , for example , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( so that @xmath41 ) , the conversion rate reads @xmath42 , that is , about @xmath43 of the incident flux is converted into the second harmonic flux , which is comparable with the conversion rate achieved in slabs ( crystals ) of optical nonlinear materials @xcite .    from the physical point of view",
    ", the scattering structure plays the role of a resonator with the quality factor inversely proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "the field in the resonator is not uniform and has periodic peaks of the amplitude @xmath4 due to a constructive interference of the scattered fundamental harmonic .",
    "the second harmonic is produced by the induced dipole radiation of point scatters located at these peaks .",
    "the induced dipole strength is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "the dipoles are excited by the incident wave and , due to their periodic arrangement , they radiate in phase producing a plane wave in the asymptotic region ( just like a phased array antenna ) .",
    "if the system has a resonance whose width @xmath6 can be continuously driven to zero by changing a physical parameter of the system , i.e. , the system has a bound state in the radiation continuum , then the strength of the induced dipoles radiating the second harmonics can be magnified as desired , but the resonator can not be excited by the incident radiation if @xmath45 ( a bound state is decoupled from the radiation continuum ) .",
    "so , the optimal width @xmath6 at which the second harmonic amplitude is maximal occurs for some @xmath46 , which explains the existence of conditions like ( [ condition ] ) . since the second harmonic is generated by point scatterers , the phase matching condition , needed for optically nonlinear crystals , is not required .",
    "the energy flux of the incident radiation is automatically redistributed and focused on the scatterers owing to the constructive interference .",
    "thanks to these physical features , an active length at which the conversion rate is maximal is close to @xmath47 whose smallest value for the system studied is roughly a half of the wave length of the incident light @xcite ( i.e. for an infrared incident radiation it is about a few hundreds nanometers ) .",
    "suppose that a scattering system has a translational symmetry along a particular direction and has non - dispersive linear and second - order nonlinear dielectric susceptibilities , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "when the electric field is parallel to the translational symmetry axis ( tm polarization ) , maxwell s equations are reduced to the scalar nonlinear wave equation @xmath50 let the coordinate system be set so that the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 have support bounded in the @xmath53direction and the system has the translational symmetry along the @xmath54direction .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) becomes a linear wave equation .",
    "so , the scattering problem can be considered for a plane wave of the frequency @xmath59 that propagates from the asymptotic region @xmath60 to the region @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are piecewise constant , i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 in regions occupied by the scattering system .",
    "a conventional treatment of the problem is based on the assumption that the solution @xmath55 is analytic in @xmath64 and , therefore , can be represented as a power series expansion , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the amplitude of the fundamental harmonics in the zero order of @xmath64 , @xmath67 is the amplitude of the second harmonics in the first order of @xmath64 , and so on .",
    "this assumption is not true if the system has bound states in the radiation continuum .",

    ". let @xmath49 be written as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the indicator function of the region occupied by the scattering system , i.e. , its value is 1 in that region and 0 elsewhere .",
    "then , if @xmath74 is the green s function of the operator @xmath75 with appropriate ( scattering ) boundary conditions , the function @xmath71 satisfies the integral equation @xmath76 \\label{eq:2.1}\\ ] ] the power series expansion ( [ eq:2 ] ) can be obtained by the method of successive approximations for this integral equation , provided the series is proved to converge . according to scattering theory @xcite , the fourier transform of @xmath74 is meromorphic in @xmath77 . as is clarified shortly ( see discussion of eq.([eq:12 ] ) )",
    ", its real poles correspond to bound states in the radiation continuum .",
    "hence , in the presence of a real pole @xmath78 , the kernel of @xmath74 is not summable and , therefore , the successive approximations produce a diverging series .",
    "this implies a non - analytic behavior of the solution in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , when a bound state in the radiation continuum is present , the conventional perturbative approach becomes inapplicable . here , a non - perturbative approach is developed to obtain the solution to the scattering problem that is valid in any small neighborhood of a real pole of the fourier transform of @xmath74 .",
    "suppose that the incident radiation is a plane wave @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , denote unit vectors along the @xmath57 , @xmath82 , and @xmath56 coordinate axes , respectively .",

    "next , it is assumed that the scattering structure is periodic in the @xmath89direction ( e.g. , a grating ) .",
    "the units of length are chosen so that the period is one . then the amplitudes @xmath87 satisfy bloch s periodicity condition @xmath90 this condition follows from the requirement that the solution @xmath55 satisfies the same periodicity condition as the incident wave @xmath91 : @xmath92 by eq.([eq:1 ] ) , the amplitudes of the different harmonics satisfy the equations , @xmath93 for ease of notation , the parameter @xmath94 is often used in lieu of @xmath64 . since @xmath95 , it is a small parameter in the system .",
