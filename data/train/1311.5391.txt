    "optical activity , comprised of optical rotation and circular dichroism on the basis of the circular polarization ( cp ) , can be observed when light passes through a structure without mirror and spatial inversion symmetry , such as helices or chiral molecules .",
    "optical rotation is the rotation of the plane of linear polarization ( lp ) after transmission .",
    "it is also known as circular birefringence because it is caused by the real part of the refractive index difference between the right - handed and the left - handed cps . on the other hand ,",
    "circular dichroism originates from the difference in the imaginary part of the refractive index between the two orthogonal cps , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference of absorption between the two cps .",
    "therefore , optical activity provides a way to control cp , which could be useful in potential applications including not only cp - light emitting devices@xcite , but also quantum information processing in solid state systems .",
    "optical activity is small for the aforementioned applications in natural materials such as quartz , but can be enhanced in artificially - prepared chiral structures whose period is comparable to the wavelength of the incident light to be modulated .",
    "a lot of works have recently been devoted to the fabrication of such chiral structures to realize large artificial optical activity and a high degree of polarization control .",
    "quasi - two - dimensional chiral systems made from metals , dielectrics , or semiconductors exhibit largely modified electric fields at the material interface , and show large degrees of optical rotation@xcite .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) chiral or helical structures are expected to further enhance the optical activity .",
    "several pioneering works using liquid crystals@xcite , polymers@xcite , metals@xcite , and dielectrics@xcite have been reported .",
    "semiconductor - based 3d chiral structures can be useful for applications such as highly efficient lasers emitting cp light and spin - photon interfaces@xcite , since it is possible in semiconductor systems to easily introduce photon emitters and to manipulate electron / hole spins confined in nanostructures .",
    "however , fabrication difficulty has largely limited the progress on semiconductor - based 3d chiral structures .",
    "a si - based 3d chiral structure has been fabricated and investigated for its 3d photonic bandgap , but not for optical activity@xcite .",
    "recent development of a micro - manipulation technique which enables the realization of high quality 3d photonic crystals ( phcs ) based on gaas@xcite will overcome the difficulty .",
    "since this technique has large flexibility in various parameters , such as constituent materials and crystal structures , it is applicable to fabricate a 3d semiconductor chiral phc with high quality and high flexibility .    in this study",
    ", we demonstrate for the first time a gaas - based 3d chiral phc .",
    "we achieve the largest optical rotation angle of @xmath20 for a single helical unit at a telecommunication wavelength , which is , for example , 30 times larger than that in a twisted phc fiber@xcite .",
    "this will pave the way to various cp - based devices and applications .",

    ", we name our chiral phc a rotationally - stacked woodpile structure .",
    "the structure in air comprises a stack of dielectric thin layers with a thickness of 225 nm .",

    "the second layer placed on top of the first layer also has periodic rods with the same width , but the spacing is @xmath21 nm and the pattern is rotated by @xmath0 with respect to the first layer .",
    "the third ( fourth ) layer placed on top of the second ( third ) layer consists of the same periodic rods as those in the first ( second ) layer , but the rods are orthogonal to the first ( second ) layer .",
    "a helical unit constructed by these four layers belongs to a spatial group with @xmath22 screw operation .",

    "nine layers are stacked in total with a total thickness of @xmath23 2 @xmath2 m , and the pattern in the ninth layer is same as that in the first layer .",

    "we define the polarization rotation angle @xmath6 as the angle between the lp direction of the incident light and the major axis of the ellipse in the elliptically polarized transmitted light .",
    "note that @xmath6 is not identical with an optical rotation angle , since the polarized plane of lp can be modified not only by optical rotation but also by linear birefringence and linear dichroism@xcite .",
    "the genuine optical rotation angle @xmath27 can be derived by the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath6 as discussed later .",

    "both @xmath6 and @xmath24 get close to zero with increasing wavelength , since light becomes insensitive to a structure much smaller than its wavelength . at @xmath26 m ,",
    "@xmath6 largely depends on @xmath16 and @xmath24 is almost independent on @xmath16 .",
    "further investigation shows that @xmath36 , which is the angle between the major axis of the ellipse in the elliptically polarized transmitted light and the @xmath11 axis in the case of @xmath37 , is constant for various @xmath16 as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "this indicates that the structure acts as a polarizer which transmits only a particular polarization at @xmath26 m . in the wavelength region 1.2 @xmath2 m",
    "@xmath29 @xmath38 m , @xmath39 increases as the wavelength becomes shorter , with small dependence on @xmath16 , indicating optical rotation .",
    "this slight @xmath16 dependence of @xmath6 is due to linear birefringence / dichroism , which is also suggested by the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath24 in fig .",
    "2(b ) for 1.2 @xmath2 m @xmath29 @xmath30 m .",
    "different from @xmath6 , the ellipticity crosses @xmath40 and changes its sign for various @xmath16 at 1.2 @xmath2 m @xmath29 @xmath30 m .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath24 is rarely caused by circular dichroism , but mainly caused by linear birefringence / dichroism .",
    "the remaining linear birefringence / dichroism is mainly due to the pattern - induced in - plane index anisotropy .",
    "note that @xmath24 is negative for all @xmath16 in most of the 2 @xmath2 m @xmath29 @xmath41 @xmath29 4 @xmath2 m range , indicating circular dichroism .    to distinguish the linear birefringence / dichroism effect from the optical rotation effect",
    ", we discuss @xmath6 as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "while the optical rotation effect on @xmath6 is independent from @xmath16 , the linear birefringence / dichroism effect on @xmath6 depends on @xmath16 with @xmath17 periodicity .",
    "hence , the linear birefringence / dichroism effect on @xmath6 can be expanded in a series of @xmath19 as the following equation@xcite , @xmath42 here , @xmath27 is the genuine optical rotation free from linear birefringence / dichroism , and @xmath43 is phase offset for the @xmath31th order of @xmath19 . note that the top layer of the studied structure has in - plane anisotropy , leading to in - plane anisotropic reflection of the incident light .",
    "this anisotropic reflection gives the same effect on @xmath6 as linear dichroism .",
    "we found that taking the first two terms of the sum could adequately describe the simulated relation between @xmath6 and @xmath16 , @xmath44 upon fitting the data for all wavelength , we could obtain the dispersion of the genuine optical rotation angle , as shown in fig .",

    "therefore , clear optical rotation is expected to be observed experimentally in this wavelength range .",

    "the quantitative difference between the experimental and simulated results is probably because the incident laser is not a complete plane wave with its wave vector slightly tilting for the structure@xcite .",
