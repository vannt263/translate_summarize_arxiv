    "in developing compressed quantum hamiltonian learning , and hence quantum bootstrapping , we will use bayesian particle filters as a subroutine . here",
    ", we briefly review these methods in a classical context , as well as with the inclusion of quantum resources .",
    "bayesian methods have been used in a wide range of quantum information applications and experiments ; for instance , to discriminate @xcite or estimate states @xcite , to incorporate models of noisy measurements @xcite , to characterize drifting frequencies @xcite , and to estimate hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "they are particularly well - suited for quantum information , owing to their generality , robustness and the ease with which prior information can be incorporated into the algorithm .",
    "moveover , bayesian approaches have been shown to allow for near - optimal hamiltonian learning in simple analytically tractable cases  @xcite .",
    "bayes theorem provides the proper way to re - assess , or update , prior beliefs about the hamiltonian for a system given an experimental outcome and a distribution describing prior beliefs .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is called the posterior distribution , @xmath3 is the prior distribution that encodes our initial beliefs about @xmath4 and where @xmath5 is the likelihood function , which computes the probability that the observed data would occur if the hamiltonian @xmath4 correctly modeled the system .",
    "the likelihood function can be estimated by sampling from a quantum simulator for the hamiltonian @xmath4 and thus bayesian inference causes hamiltonian learning to reduce to a hamiltonian simulation problem  @xcite .",
    "once the posterior distribution is found , an estimate of the hamiltonian , @xmath6 , is given by the expectation over the posterior , @xmath7              = \\int h \\pr(h | \\text{data})\\ { \\mathrm{d}}h.\\ ] ] this integral is unlikely to be analytically tractable in practice , as it requires integrating the likelihood function @xmath8 over @xmath4 .",
    "monte carlo integration , on the other hand , can be much more practical .",
    "the sequential monte carlo algorithm ( also known as a _ particle filter _ ) provides a means of sampling from an inaccessible distribution using a transition kernel from some initial distribution @xcite .",
    "we can sample from the posterior by using bayes rule as the smc transition kernel , given samples from a prior distribution and evaluations of the likelihood function .",
    "integrals over the posterior can then be _ approximated _ by using these samples , which allows quantities such as @xmath6 to be efficiently estimated .",
    "smc has seen use in a range of quantum information tasks , including state estimation @xcite , frequency and hamiltonian learning @xcite , benchmarking quantum operations @xcite , and in characterizing superconducting device environments @xcite .",
    "similar methods have also been applied to quantum error correction  @xcite .",
    "hamiltonians are not usually represented explicitly as matrices when using smc algorithms and are instead parameterized by a vector @xmath9 of model parameters such that @xmath10 .",
    "this representation allows for parameter reduction with prior information and can include effects outside of a purely quantum formalism , such as control distortions or stochastic fluctuations in measurement visibility",
    ". it also has the advantage that hamiltonian learning is possible even in cases where matrix representations of individual terms in the hamiltonian are not formally known .",
    "concretely , the smc algorithm approximates prior and posterior distributions by weighted sums of delta - functions , @xmath11 such that the current state of knowledge can be tracked online using a classical computer to record a list of _ particles _ , each corresponding to a hypothesis @xmath12 , and having a relative weights @xmath13 .",
    "these weights are then updated by substituting the smc approximation into bayes rule to obtain @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an observation from the experimental system .    over time , the particle weights for the majority of the particles will diminish as the smc algorithm becomes more confident that certain hypotheses are wrong .",
    "this reduces the total effective number of particles in the posterior distribution and ultimately prevents learning .",
    "this issue is addressed by using a resampling algorithm , which draws a new set of uniformly weighted smc particles that approximately maintain the mean and covariance matrix of the posterior distribution  @xcite .",
    "although the remainder of the process of learning using the smc process is rigorous and well understood , error estimates are not known for the resampling step .",
    "furthermore , resampling methods such as the liu and west algorithm  @xcite have known pathologies where they can fail if they are provided with a multi  modal distribution or if an improbable sequence of measurements leads to a resampling step that causes the smc particle cloud to have no support over the true model .",
    "these issues are often addressed by varying the parameters used in the resampling algorithm , majority voting on the identity of the true model over multiple runs of smc or adjusting the guess heuristic used to choose experiments . moreover ,",
    "these shortcomings are often heralded by effective sample size criteria built into smc software  @xcite , such that a more appropriate resampler or set of resampling parameters can be chosen . in spite of these theoretical shortcomings ,",
    "resampling methods work exceptionally well in practice for problems in hamiltonian learning  @xcite , machine learning  @xcite , computer vision @xcite , and artificial intelligence  @xcite .",
    "quantum hamiltonian learning ( qhl ) builds upon smc by introducing weak simulation , in which the experimentalist has access to a `` black box '' that produces data according to an input hypothesis @xmath9 . by repeatedly sampling this black box for each smc hypothesis",
    ", the likelihood can be inferred from the frequencies of data output by the black - box simulator @xcite .",
    "qhl is therefore a classical bayesian inference algorithm that uses a fast quantum method for estimating the likelihood function via quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "this augmented procedure is robust to errors in the likelihood function introduced by finite sampling of the black box and to approximation errors in the hamiltonians used @xcite .",
    "this latter property will be of particular importance in the development of compressed qhl , as it allows us to use a _ truncation _ of the complete system as an approximate simulator .",
    "the simulators used in qhl can take many forms : they could be special purpose analog simulators such as an ion trap that implements a family of transverse ising models  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum simulation could be implemented by using a quantum computer to run a digital simulation algorithm that is capable of efficiently simulating a wide array of hamiltonian models  @xcite ( such as @xmath15sparse row  computable hamiltonians ) .",
    "we refer to all such devices as _ quantum simulators _ to reflect the fact that they need not be a fault  tolerant quantum computer . in our work",
    "we also require that the simulator be able to accept its initial state as input from another quantum system , but there are simpler qhl methods that do not need to be run in this fashion .",
    "the simplest experimental design proposed for qhl is quantum likelihood evaluation ( qle ) , in which the experimenter prepares a state @xmath16 on the untrusted system , evolve under the `` true '' hamiltonian @xmath17 for some time @xmath18 , and then measures @xmath19 on the trusted simulator .",
    "this experiment is then repeated for each smc hypothesis @xmath12 until the variance in the estimated likelihood becomes sufficiently small .",
    "the experiment design is illustrated in .",
    "qle can be effective for learning hamiltonians , although it suffers from the fact that the evolution times used by the experiments must be small for most hamiltonians . in the case of qle ,",
    "long evolution times for typical hamiltonians ( such as gaussian random hamiltonians  @xcite ) produce a distribution that is very close to uniform over measurement outcomes , such that experiments provide an exponentially small amount of information about the parameters .",
    "the tendancy of quantum systems to rapidly equilibrate also causes the update step in the smc algorithm to become unstable  @xcite . here by unstable we mean that small perturbations in the estimated likelihoods result in large deviations in the posterior distribution .",
    "this can be combatted by using short experiments , which lead to uncertainties about the true model ( after one update ) that scale at least as @xmath20 ( see  ) . as a result ,",
    "short - time evolutions necessitate processing exponentially more data than would be required if long experiments could be performed .",
    "moreover , given that the time required for state preparation is independent of @xmath18 , it is clear that the total experimental time used to learn the true model will be prohibitively large in such cases .",
    "thus the ability to use long experiments can lead to substantial improvements for hamiltonian learning .    to use the long evolution times requisite for expedient high - accuracy characterization",
    "the system of interest can be coupled to the simulator using @xmath21 gates , as shown in .",
    "this experiment design , interactive quantum likelihood evaluation ( iqle ) , uses the simulator to approximately _",
    "the forward evolution under the unknown system , such that the measurement is approximately described by @xmath22 provided we choose an inversion hypothesis @xmath23 that is close to @xmath17 .",
    "intuitively , such experiments directly compare the dynamics of @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "such experiments also reduce the norm of the effective system hamiltonian , which typically allows the system to evolve for much longer before the quantum probability distribution becomes flat .",
    "these swap gates need not be perfect , as the learning protocol is known to be robust to such errors  @xcite .",
    "we further discuss the effects of faulty swap gates on bootstrapping in  . in cases",
    "where a swap gate can not be implemented , such as when the trusted resource is implemented using an incompatible modality , non - interactive quantum hamiltonian learning can be used to perform the first iteration of bootstrapping , such that swap gates are available in all further iterations .",
    "that is , we can use qle to initialize the bootstrapping procedure , and can proceed using iqle .    in order to combat the exponentially diminishing likelihood of the system returning to its initial state after the inversion , we require that @xmath25 is approximately constant  @xcite .",
    "we use the particle guess heuristic ( pgh ) to achieve this .",
    "the pgh involves drawing two hypotheses about @xmath4 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , from the prior distribution and then choosing @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath29 is an estimate of the uncertainty in the hamiltonian , we expect that at most a constant fraction of the prior distribution will satisfy @xmath30 assuming @xmath24 is linear and the prior distribution has converged to a unimodal distribution centered about the true hamiltonian .",
    "the heuristic therefore seldom leads to experiments for which @xmath31 for most @xmath9 . moreover , since the pgh relies only on the current smc approximation to the posterior , the heuristic incurs no additional simulation costs .",
    "rather , the pgh provides adaptivity by depending on the current state of knowledge about the state of the quantum system through the particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "experiment design via the particle guess heuristic has been shown to lead to efficient estimation of hamiltonians using iqle @xcite , and has since been usefully applied in other experimental contexts @xcite .",
    "previous work has analyzed the complexity of learning using iqle  @xcite . in cases",
    "where the error in the characterized hamiltonian scales as @xmath32 and @xmath33 samples are used to estimate the likelihood function , the protocol requires @xmath34 simulations to learn the vector of hamiltonian parameters to within error @xmath35 as measured by the @xmath36norm . in practice ,",
    "the decay constant @xmath37 depends on the number of parameters used to describe @xmath4 and the properties of the experiments used .",
    "it does not directly depend on the dimension of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the updating procedure used to combine these results is further known to be stable provided that the likelihoods of the observed experimental outcomes are not exponentially small for the majority of the smc particles  @xcite .",
    "this occurs for well posed learning problems that use two outcome experiments .",
    "information locality is what enables cqhl and in turn quantum bootstrapping .",
    "this idea is made concrete via lieb ",
    "robinson bounds , which show that an analog of special relativity exists for local observables evolving under hamiltonians that have rapidly decaying interactions  @xcite . lieb ",
    "robinson bounds give an effective `` light cone '' , as illustrated in , in which the evolution of an observable @xmath38 can be accurately simulated without needing to consider any subsystem outside of the light cone .",
    "specifically , they imply that a local observable @xmath39 provides at most an exponentially small amount of information about subsystems that are further than distance @xmath40 away from the support of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the lieb  robinson velocity for the system and @xmath18 is the evolution time . here",
    ", @xmath42 is analogous to the speed of light , and only depends on the geometry and strengths of the interactions in the system  @xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath40 is bounded above by a constant and the initial support of @xmath38 is small then the support of @xmath39 is at most a constant .",
    "this shows that the dynamics of @xmath39 can be simulated using a small quantum device , provided @xmath40 is sufficiently small .",
    "compressed qhl exploits this intuition by evolving an initial state under the untrusted quantum simulator , swapping the quantum state of a subsystem of the larger ( uncharacterized ) system into a quantum simulator , and then approximately inverting the evolution by guessing the hamiltonian dynamics and simulating their inverse .",
    "it then measures the simulator to determine whether the inversion yielded the initial state or a state in its orthogonal compliment .",
    "one step of this process is illustrated in  .",
    "the inversion process used in interactive qle not only leads to more informative experiments , but we will show in that generalizing to include repeated applications of swaps and inverse simulations also delay the rate at which the light cone propagates from the observable .",
    "this in turn allows much longer evolution times to be used without the observable stretching beyond the confines of the trusted simulator .",
    "in particular , this swapping procedure leads to characteristic lieb ",
    "robinson velocities that shrink as the experimentalist learns more about the system .",
    "_ that is , the light cone represents an `` epistemic '' speed of light in the coupled systems that arises from the speed of information propagation depending more strongly on the uncertainty in the hamiltonian than the hamiltonian itself .",
    "_ since the effective speed of light slows as more information is learned , long evolutions can be used when the uncertainty is small .",
    "this removes a major restriction of the method of da silva et al  @xcite since the variance of any unbiased estimator of the hamiltonian parameters diverges as @xmath43 for hamiltonian learning methods that use short time experiments ( see   for more details ) .     for a single step of an @xmath44 step protocol .",
    "the green region is the light cone after the evolution in the untrusted device , and the blue region is after inversion in the trusted device .",
    "the dashed lines show the spread of @xmath39 due to inexact inversion in the trusted simulator . ]    to analyse the error introduced by compressed simulation , we consider learning a hamiltonian @xmath4 by measurement of an observable @xmath38 supported on @xmath45 sites , using a simulator with support on @xmath46 sites .",
    "we then expand @xmath4 into those terms @xmath47 which we can access with our simulator , the terms @xmath48 supported only outside of the simulator entirely , and the interaction @xmath49 between these two partitions .",
    "we then further break down @xmath49 into those terms @xmath50 which have non  trivial action between sites in @xmath38 and the neglected sites , and those terms @xmath51 which act upon sites in the simulator , but not the observable .",
    "that is , we expand @xmath4 as @xmath52 the decomposition of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath53 into couplings that include and exclude @xmath38 is illustrated in .",
    "cqhl neglects the terms included in @xmath50 when processing data collected from the system of interest .",
    "if @xmath4 exhibits a finite lieb - robinson velocity , then we can bound the error introduced by this approximation .",
    "moreover , we will show that by using interactivity as a resource , we can reduce this error as we become more certain about the dynamics of the untrusted system .",
    "we discuss these two considerations in more detail below .",
    "it is helpful , however , to first build intuition by considering the special case that all terms in the unknown system s hamiltonian are local and mutually commute .",
    "this is true , for instance , in the ising models   that we consider in numeric examples . in this case , the compressed interactive likelihood evaluation experiment described in is particularly simple to analyze .",
    "separation of @xmath54 where @xmath50 are interactions with qubits in the support of @xmath38 ( red solid box ) and @xmath51 interacts with qubits that are swapped into the trusted simulator but are outside @xmath38 ( blue dashed box ) . ]",
    "if we work in the heisenberg picture then it is easy to see from the assumption that the hamiltonian terms commute with each other ( but not necessarily @xmath38 ) that @xmath55=0 $ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the simulated observable within the trusted simulator .    using hadamard s lemma and the triangle inequality to bound the truncation error @xmath58",
    ", we obtain that @xmath59 if the objective is to have error at most @xmath60 in the compressed simulation then it suffices to choose experiments with evolution time at most @xmath61 if the sum of the magnitudes of the interaction terms that are neglected in the simulation is a constant then   shows that @xmath18 scales at most linearly in @xmath60 as @xmath62 . this is potentially problematic because short experiments can provide much less information than longer experiments",
    "so it may be desirable to increase the size of the trusted simulator as @xmath60 shrinks to reduce the experimental time needed to bootstrap the system .",
    "qhl is robust to @xmath60  @xcite and @xmath63 often suffices for the inference procedure to proceed without noticeable degradation .",
    "note that if @xmath64 then infinite  time simulations are possible for commuting models ( such as ising models ) because no truncation error is incurred .",
    "trivial cases for qhl only occur in commuting models with long range interactions .",
    "if the hamiltonian contains non  commuting terms then the factorization of @xmath65 used in   no longer holds .",
    "this is because @xmath66 unlike in commuting models .",
    "such dynamics can also lead to observables @xmath39 that rapibly obtain non ",
    "negligible support near the boundary of the trusted simulator .",
    "the trusted system will not tend to simulate these evolutions accurately because significant interactions exist between @xmath39 and the neglected portion of the system .",
    "this means a more careful argument will be needed to show that bootstrapping will also be successful here .",
    "we address this issue by generalizing iqle experiments .",
    "typically , each iqle experiment is of the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a swap operation and @xmath69 is a hamiltonian simulated by the trusted simulator .",
    "instead of swapping the states of both devices once , we generalize such experiments to consist of @xmath44 swaps , such that the observable evolves under the unitary @xmath70 before we perform a measurement .",
    "it is then easy to see from the trotter formula that @xmath71 .",
    "the inclusion of additional swap operations serves two purposes .",
    "firstly , it causes the terms in the hamiltonian to effectively commute with each other for @xmath44 sufficiently large .",
    "secondly , if @xmath18 is small relative to @xmath72 then @xmath44 swaps of the two registers will not cause the @xmath39 to have substantial support on the boundary of the trusted simulator at any step in the protocol .",
    "if a large value of @xmath44 is chosen , then the system effectively evolves under @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "we expect that the dynamics of @xmath38 will therefore be dictated by the properties of @xmath75 for short evolutions .",
    "we make this intuition precise by showing in that the error from using a small trusted simulator obeys    @xmath76\\| + \\|[h_{\\rm int},h_{\\rm in}]\\|)\\|a\\|\\frac{t^2}{r}+2\\|h_{{\\rm int}\\bigcap a}\\|\\|a\\| t\\\\        & \\qquad+2\\|h_{{\\rm int}\\setminus a}\\| \\|a\\| |\\{a\\}|te^{-\\mu { \\rm dist}(a , h_{\\rm out})}\\left[e^{2s|t| } -1 \\right]e^{2\\|h_{\\rm out}+h_{{\\rm int}\\setminus a}\\|t / r } ,      \\end{aligned }    \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    for cases of nearest  neighbor or exponentially decaying interactions between subsystems .",
    "@xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and related terms are explained in   and the surrounding text . here",
    "@xmath42 is the lieb  robinson velocity for evolutions under @xmath75 and @xmath80 is related to the rate at which interactions decay with the graph distance between subsystems .",
    "it is worth noting that   can be improved by using higher order trotter ",
    "suzuki formulas in place of the basic trotter formula to reduce @xmath44  @xcite and also by using tighter lieb ",
    "robinson bounds for cases with nearest ",
    "neighbor hamiltonians .",
    "the variable @xmath75 is related through the particle guess heuristic to the uncertainty in the hamiltonian , which implies that the speed of information propagation is also a function of the uncertainty in @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "that is , longer evolutions can be taken as @xmath4 becomes known with ever greater certainty .",
    "this means that the lieb  robinson velocity does not pose a fundamental restriction on the evolution times permitted because @xmath81 as @xmath82 .",
    "of course , the error term @xmath83 in   places a limitation on the evolution time but that term can be suppressed exponentially by increasing the diameter of the set of qubits in the trusted simulator for systems with interactions that decay at least exponentially with distance .",
    "thus the roadblocks facing compressed qhl can be addressed at modest cost by using our strategy of repeatedly swapping the subsystems in the trusted and untrusted devices .    as an example , if we assume ( a ) that the interactions are between qubits on a line ( b ) that @xmath84 is chosen such that @xmath85 then in the limit as @xmath86 @xmath87 suffices to guarantee simulation error of @xmath60 .",
    "this result is qualitatively similar to   and requires that @xmath88 scales at most logarithmically with the total evolution time desired .",
    "qubits , a @xmath89 qubit simulator and a @xmath36 qubit observable .",
    "blue ( dashed ) box is support of simulator , red ( solid ) box is support of @xmath38 . ]",
    "the previous methods provide a method for characterizing a subsystem of the global hamiltonian .",
    "these results can not be used directly to learn the full system hamiltonian because the trusted simulator lacks couplings present in the full system . instead",
    "the hamiltonian must be inferred by patching together the results of many hamiltonian inference steps .",
    "this process can be thought of as a scanning procedure wherein an observable is moved across the set of qubits collecting information about the couplings that strongly influence it .",
    "the scanning procedure is illustrated in  .    in order to properly update the information about the system , we modify sequential monte carlo to use two particle clouds .",
    "the first is the global cloud , which keeps track of the prior distribution over all the parameters in the hamiltonian model .",
    "the second is the local cloud , which keeps track of all of the parameters needed for the current compressed qhl experiment .",
    "the global cloud is constrained such that the weights of each particle in the cloud is constant ( i.e. the probability density is represented by the density of particles rather than their weight ) , whereas the local cloud is not constrained in this fashion .",
    "this constraint on the global cloud is needed because resampling does not in general preserve the indices of each particle , so that there is no way to sensibly identify a global particle that corresponds to a particle in the local posterior .    instead , by copying a subset of global parameters into the local cloud , our modified particle filter approximates the prior by a product distribution between the local and remaining parameters .",
    "resampling the local posterior then makes this approximation again , ensuring that the local weights are uniform .",
    "thus , we can copy the ( newly resampled ) local cloud into the global cloud , overwriting the corresponding parameters .",
    "once the local cloud is merged back into the global cloud in this way , we begin the next step in the scan by selecting a different set of parameters for the local cloud , and continuing with the next compressed qhl experiment .",
    "we implement this scanning procedure in our numerical experiments by using a local observable centered as far left on the spin chain as possible .",
    "we then infer the hamiltonian for this location using a fixed number of experiments , swap the hamiltonian parameters from each of the smc particles to the global cloud and then move the observable one site to the right .",
    "this process is repeated until the observable has scanned over the entire chain of qubits , and then we begin again by scanning over the first @xmath90 qubits in reverse , where @xmath45 is the width of the observable .",
    "we do this to reduce the systematic bias that emerges from the fact that hamiltonian parameters associated with couplings learned earlier in the procedure will have greater uncertainty .      here investigate the circumstances under which cqhl is efficient .",
    "the number of experiments that are needed in cqhl is @xmath91 . if we then make the pessimistic assumption that @xmath92 scans are needed and assume that the error within each scan decays as @xmath93 then the number of experiments needed to make the _ combined error _ in the inferred vector of hamiltonian parameters , @xmath9 , at most @xmath35 it suffices to use a number of experiments that scales as @xmath94 here we have used the fact that if there are @xmath95 scans and the error in the hamiltonian parameters is @xmath96 then the error in the reconstructed hamiltonian parameters after @xmath95 scans is at most @xmath97 .",
    "this bound is again pessimistic as in practice the information learned in subsequent scans actually reduces , rather than increases , the error in parameters learned from previous scans .",
    "the number of calls to our trusted simulator needed to update the weights of the particles in the smc cloud is @xmath98 .",
    "firstly , if @xmath99 samples are used to infer the likelihoods of the outcome for each of the @xmath100 particles in the smc cloud , then the total number of experiments required to learn a fixed hamiltonian on @xmath95 qubits the number of simulations that are needed to estimate the likelihoods within error @xmath60 is @xmath101 this quantifies the number of experiments that are needed to estimate the likelihoods within error @xmath102 given a perfect simulator .    in cases with non - commuting hamiltonians ,",
    "error is also incurred by using a non - infinite value of @xmath44 .",
    "if we also demand that the contribution from this source of error is @xmath102 then it is straight forward to see from   that the necessary value of @xmath44 scales at most as    @xmath103\\|+\\|[h_{\\rm int},h_{\\rm in}]\\|)\\|a\\|t^2}{\\delta } + ( \\|h_{\\rm out}\\|+\\|h_{\\rm in\\setminus a}\\|)t \\right).\\ ] ]    the above relations set the complexity ( as measured by the number of experiments and the number of swaps ) of hamiltonian characterization , but the space requirements also are problem dependent in cases that have non - commuting hamiltonians .",
    "if we assume that all interactions between arbitrary qubits @xmath104 and @xmath105 decay at least as @xmath106 , then the distance between @xmath38 and the neglected part of the hamiltonian @xmath51 can be chosen as @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the number of sites on which @xmath38 is supported , @xmath42 is the lieb - robinson velocity for evolution under @xmath75 , and where @xmath80 is the exponential clustering parameter used in .    from the particle guess heuristic , we have that @xmath40 is asymptotically constant and thus both the number of qubits and the number of experiments scale logarithmically with the desired accuracy .",
    "the number of inversions used @xmath44 scales polynomially with @xmath18 , which scales as @xmath109  @xcite and thus the number of swaps scales polynomially with the desired error tolerance .",
    "this scaling can be made to approach the heisenberg limit of @xmath109 scaling by replacing the trotter formula used in the inversion step with increasingly high  order trotter ",
    "suzuki formulas as @xmath35 shrinks  @xcite .",
    "the above analysis can also be extended to systems with polynomial decay of interactions .",
    "in such cases , the cqhl algorithm is less efficient because the logarithmic scaling with @xmath110 is replaced with polynomial scaling with @xmath110 in most instances of polynomially - decaying interactions . even in such cases ,",
    "however , we expect the sequential monte carlo algorithm to remain robust to simulation errors such as truncation .",
    "thus , we expect that compressed quantum hamiltonian learning can offer advantages when the lieb - robinson velocity of an untrusted system under inversion by a hypothesis is finite .    in some cases , such as dipolar coupling , existing lieb ",
    "robinson bounds diverge  @xcite .",
    "this does not imply , however , the lack of a finite information propagation velocity however ; indeed , it is worth noting that finite speeds of information propagation are expected theoretically and observed experimentally for finite systems with dipolar couplings  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the presence of disorder , experimental evidence suggests that the information propagation velocity can be dramatically reduced  @xcite .",
    "an important remaining issue is the scaling of @xmath60 and the number of particles .",
    "we know from prior work that bayesian inference is highly tolerant of errors in the likelihood function  @xcite and that @xmath63 typically suffices . furthermore , the number of particles in the smc cloud , @xmath100 , is a slowly increasing function of the number of model parameters for the hamiltonian and does not explicitly depend on the hilbert space dimension  @xcite . in the numerical experiments we have performed in this , and prior work , we observe that @xmath100 tends to scale roughly logarithmically with the number of model parameters  @xcite .",
    "this means that none of the above issues present a fundamental obstacle for compressed quantum hamiltonian learning .",
    "we will now turn our attention to quantum bootstrapping , which is an application wherein compressed quantum hamiltonian learning is used to infer control maps for uncharacterized devices .",
    "control maps relate control settings of a device to its system hamiltonian . learning these maps",
    "is of particular importance if cross - talk or defects cause different parts of the system to respond differently to the same controls . in such cases ,",
    "hamiltonian characterization is a necessary part of the control design and calibration process .    to concretely show how quantum hamiltonian learning can address this challenge",

    "since quantum devices capable of implementing our bootstrapping protocol are not currently available , we examine systems that can be simulated efficiently using classical computers in order to demonstrate that our algorithm applies to large systems .",
    "thus , we focus on the example of an ising model on a linear chain of qubits , with exponentially decaying interactions , @xmath167 where the parameters @xmath168 are distributed according to the uniform distribution @xmath169 . in all cases ,",
    "the observable used is @xmath170 for @xmath171 , as this observable is maximally informative for ising models . for more general models , a pseudorandom",
    "input state and observable can be used instead @xcite .",
    "shows that a compressed quantum simulator using only @xmath165 quantum bits is capable of learning a hamiltonian model for a system with @xmath0 qubits .",
    "the errors , as measured by the operator norm of difference between the actual hamiltonian and the inferred hamiltonian , are typically on the order of @xmath172 after as few as @xmath173 experiments per scan where @xmath174 scans are used in total .",
    "this is especially impressive after noting that this constitutes roughly @xmath166 kilobits of data and that this error of @xmath172 is spread over @xmath175 terms .",
    "the data also shows evidence of exponential decay of the error , which is expected from prior studies  @xcite .",
    "an important difference between this result and existing qhl schemes  @xcite is that the observable will need to be , in some cases , substantially smaller than the simulator .",
    "choosing a small observable is potentially problematic because it becomes more likely that an erroneous outcome will be indistinguishable from the initial state .",
    "also , if @xmath45 is too small then important long - range couplings can be overlooked because their effect becomes hard to distinguish from local interactions .",
    "we find in   that the cases where @xmath176 and @xmath177 are virtually indistinguishable whereas the median errors are substantially larger for @xmath178 , but not substantially worse than @xmath176 for @xmath179 experiments / scan .",
    "this provides evidence that small @xmath45 can suffice for hamiltonian learning .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the next set of results show that compressed qhl can be used to bootstrap a quantum simulator for a @xmath0 qubit @xmath182d ising model . the bootstrapping problem that we consider can be thought of as correcting crosstalk in the large simulator .",
    "this crosstalk manifests itself when the experimentalist attempts to turn on only one of the ising couplings in the simulator but in fact all @xmath175 interactions are actually activated to some extent .",
    "we further assume that the @xmath0 qubit simulator only has @xmath174 controls corresponding to each of the nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "this means that a perfect control sequence will generally not exist because @xmath183 .",
    "the control hamiltonians @xmath184 $ ] in   conform to   with @xmath185 .",
    "we also take @xmath132 .",
    "reveals that our bootstrapping procedure reduces control errors by two orders of magnitude in cases where @xmath173 experiments / scan are used in the qhl step .",
    "further reductions could be achieved by increasing the number of experiments / scan , but at @xmath173 scans much of the error arises from @xmath186 so a richer set of controls in the @xmath0 qubit system would be needed to substantially reduce the residual control errors .",
    "the errors are sufficiently small , however , that it is reasonable that the device could be used as a trusted simulator for nearest  neighbor ising models .",
    "this means that it could be subsequently used to bootstrap another quantum simulator .",
    "all of the examples considered so far examine compressed qhl for @xmath0 qubits .",
    "although the fact that the protocol scales successfully up to @xmath0 qubits already provides strong evidence for its scalability , we provide further evidence here that the errors in compressed qhl do not rapidly vary as a function of the number of qubits in the untrusted system , @xmath95 . as per the previous numerical examples , we consider a @xmath182d ising model with @xmath169 and use a @xmath89 qubit observable .",
    "also @xmath187 particles are used in the smc approximation to the posterior and we take all data using @xmath179 experiments per scan . roughly @xmath188 data points per value of @xmath95 were considered .",
    "we see in   that the error , as measured by the median @xmath189 distance between the inferred model and the true model , is a slowly increasing function of @xmath95 .",
    "the data is consistent with a linear scaling in @xmath95 , although the data does not preclude other scalings .",
    "this suggests that the error in compressed qhl does not rapidly increase for the class of hamiltonians considered here and provides evidence that examples with far more than @xmath0 qubits are not outside the realm of possibility for compressed qhl .",
    "we show that small quantum simulators can be used to characterize and calibrate larger devices , thus providing a way to bootstrap to capabilities beyond what can be implemented classically .",
    "in particular , we provide a compressed quantum hamiltonian learning algorithm that can infer hamiltonians for systems with local or rapidly decaying interactions .",
    "the compressed algorithm is feasible because of the fact that local observables remain confined to light cones .",
    "typically these light cones spread at a velocity that is dictated by the hamiltonian .",
    "by contrast , in compressed qhl , light cones spread at a speed that depends on the uncertainty in the hamiltonian in compressed qhl .",
    "this not only allows more informative experiments to be chosen but also shows that an epistemic speed of light can exist in systems that interact with an intelligent agent .",
    "we then show that this algorithm provides the tools necessary to bootstrap a quantum system ; wherein a small simulator to learn controls that correct hamiltonian errors and uncertainties present in a larger quantum device .",
    "this protocol is useful , for instance , in calibrating control designs to deal with cross - talk , uncertainties in coupling strengths and other effects that cause the controls to act differently on the quantum system than the designed behavior .",
    "our approaches , being based on quantum hamiltonian learning , inherit the same noise and sample error robustness observed in that algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we have provided numerical evidence that our techniques apply to systems with as many as @xmath0 qubits , can further tolerate low precision observables , and are surprisingly efficient .",
    "thus , quantum bootstrapping provides a potentially scalable technique for application in even large quantum devices , and in experimentally - reasonable contexts .",
    "our work therefore provides a critical resource for building practical quantum information processing devices and computationally useful quantum simulators .",
    "there are several natural extensions to our work .",
    "while we have focused on the case of time - independent quantum controls and hamiltonians , our approaches can be generalized to the time dependent case using more general lieb ",
    "robinson bounds  @xcite .",
    "this is significant because techniques such as the method of da silva et al  @xcite do not apply for @xmath190 .",
    "additionally , it would be very interesting to see if quantum simulation can be used to allow local optimization to design even better experiments than those yielded by the particle guess heuristic .",
    "the introduction of cost effective local optimization strategies may lead to significant advantages for bootstrapping systems with non  commuting hamiltonians .    as a final remark",
    ", our work provides an important step towards a practical general method for calibrating and controlling large quantum devices , by utilizing epistemic light cones to compress the simulation , thus enabling the application of small quantum devices as a resource . in doing so",
    ", our approach also provides a _ platform _ for building tractable solutions to more complicated design problems through the application of quantum simulation algorithms and characterization techniques .",

    "<S> tomography is inefficient  @xcite and existing efficient methods such as  @xcite require an amount of data that scales polynomially with the error tolerance , are not known to be error robust and are only efficient for specific classes of hamiltonians and measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this can render them impractical for problems like designing controls for quantum systems where exacting error tolerance and low fault sensitivity is required . </S>",
    "<S> other methods are error robust and use a logarithmic amount of data , but also require performing quantum simulations that are intractable classically  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> these applications are efficient if the unknown hamiltonian belongs to an efficiently parameterized class of model hamiltonians for which the interaction strengths between subsystems decay rapidly with distance , experiments are chosen such that the resultant distribution of likelihoods is far from uniform and that the control maps in the bootstrapping case are well conditioned . </S>",
    "<S> efficiency also requires that the resampling algorithms used in the methods do not introduce substantial error in the system . </S>",
