    "networks are everywhere around us . due to their inherent non - trivial topological and functional characteristics ,",
    "some of them are called complex networks , for instance , biological networks , food webs , internet , the world wide web , financial markets and social networks @xcite .",
    "the study of the facts responsible for structural and dynamical behaviour of these networks has generated a lot of interest in recent past .",
    "several deterministic and stochastic models are proposed to replicate the structure and dynamics of real world complex networks supported with empirical data @xcite .",
    "the comparison of these models with real networks is done usually by comparing different properties of the networks including degree distribution , diameter or average path length , average clustering coefficient , frequencies of triangles , degree - degree correlation etc .    the erds rnyi model ( henceforth denoted by ` er ' )",

    "this is a stochastic model generated by two steps : ( 1 ) growth of the network with the addition of new nodes ( 2 ) probabilistic preferential attachment of the new nodes to the existing nodes based on their degree .",
    "this model lacks the degree - degree correlation of the nodes @xcite which is a genuine property of most of the real networks , and frequencies of triangles(responsible for network transitivity ) in the model is very less @xcite which contradicts the property of most real networks . in @xcite",
    ", the authors remarked that stochastic models lack any visual understanding of the scale - freeness and hence they introduced a hierarchical deterministic scale - free model .",
    "however , this model lacks clustering property of real - world networks .",
    "another hierarchical deterministic scale - free model was presented in @xcite with high clustering coefficient , however other important properties are unexplored .",
    "pseudo - fractal scale free model(henceforth denoted by ` pfsf ' ) is an another deterministic scale free model introduced in @xcite , in which , the network starts from a single edge at time @xmath3 and at each timestep @xmath4 ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) new nodes are added to the network corresponding to each edge of the network generated at time @xmath7 . all the above mentioned models except er model has increasing diameter with the addition of the new nodes to the existing network which is being contradicted by an observation of constant / shrinking diameter phenomenon of certain real networks reported in @xcite . in @xcite ,",

    "since clustering coefficient reflects the frequency of the triangles in a network which is studied extensively in social network research @xcite , we also compare the frequency of triangles in networks generated by ba and fsf models in fig .",
    "it shows from the results that the frequency of triangles in a sccg is higher compared to other models .",
    "the degree - degree correlation of nodes in a network defines the notion of assortativity and disassortativity @xcite of a network .",
    "assortativity signifies the existence of links between nodes of similar degrees whereas the existence of links between nodes of dissimilar degrees is known as disassortativity .",
    "thus , disassortativity implies the propensity of connection of nodes of different types in a network .",
    "the correlation coefficient or assortativity coefficient ( @xmath10 ) @xcite is evaluated as @xmath114 where @xmath115 represents the @xmath116 entry of adjacency matrix of the network , @xmath117 is the degree of node @xmath17 in the network , @xmath118 is the number of edges in the network , and @xmath119 is the kronecker delta function . if @xmath10 is positive , the network follows assortative mixing pattern of nodes whereas negative value of @xmath10 implies disassortative mixing of nodes in the network .    as we calculate the assortativity coefficient numerically for sccg with @xmath120 as the seed graph and for networks generated by ba and fsf models",

    "[ 13a ] ) while it goes to zero for networks produced by ba and fsf models .",
