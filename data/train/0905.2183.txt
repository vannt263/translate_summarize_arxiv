    "normal pulsars ( @xmath4 few seconds , @xmath5 g ) in low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems are believed to potentially spin - up to reach milliseconds rotational periods by acquiring angular momentum from their companion @xcite .",
    "the millisecond modulations in the x - ray signal observed from some of these actively accreting neutron stars and bursting sources are likely to be signatures indicative of their spin periods .",
    "there are about @xmath620 nuclear or accretion powered ( see table  1 ) millisecond x - ray pulsars ( msxps ) which are thought to be the progenitors of millisecond radio pulsars ( msrps ) @xcite .",
    "these millisecond x - ray pulsars may become observable in radio wavelengths once accretion ceases , or the column density of the plasma from the fossil disk around the neutron star becomes thin enough to allow vacuum gap formation that leads to the production of coherent radio emission . towards the end of the secular lmxb evolution , as accretion rates fall below a critical value above",
    "which detection presumably may be hampered due to absorption or dispersion @xcite , the neutron star can re - appear as a millisecond radio pulsar .",
    "although the connection between lmxbs and msrps has been significantly strengthened after the discovery of quasi - periodic khz oscillations and x - ray pulsations in some transient x - ray sources @xcite , no radio pulsations from millisecond x - ray pulsars have been detected so far @xcite .",
    "accretion physics @xcite predicts an equilibrium period ( @xmath7^{-3/7}$ ] ) @xcite of the neutron star that is accreting in the lmxb system which is constrained by the accretion rate @xmath8 ) .",
    "this equilibrium period combined with the dominant mechanism for energy loss delineates the subsequent kinematics of the spun - up millisecond pulsar .",
    "the magnetic dipole model then implies a `` spin - up region '' ( @xmath9 ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on which the recycled neutron stars will be reborn as millisecond radio pulsars . at the end of the active phase ,",
    "millisecond x - ray pulsars accreting with @xmath10 and spinning with @xmath11 , presumably transition into a millisecond radio pulsar with an initial spin period of @xmath12 .",
    "the energy loss due to magnetic dipole radiation after the onset or radio emission is the main process that drives the evolution for millisecond radio pulsars ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "alternative energy loss mechanisms such as multipole radiation or gravitational wave emission , especially during the initial phases of the reborn millisecond pulsars , have been suggested by several authors @xcite but have yet to be observationally corroborated .",
    "advanced laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) will be able to probe the frequency space at which millisecond pulsars are expected to radiate gravitational waves , thereby putting stringent constraints on the micro physics of millisecond pulsars .",
    "the advances in radio observations , increased sky coverage with deep exposures of current surveys combined with robust post - bayesian statistical techniques that incorporate minimal assumptions , give us unprecedented predictive power on the joint period - spindown ( @xmath2 ) and implied magnetic field ( @xmath13 ) distributions .    here , we attempt to go beyond phenomenological arguments and test whether millisecond x - ray pulsars can produce the characteristics of the observed millisecond radio pulsars within the framework of the standard model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in order to statistically constrain millisecond pulsar evolution , we need to describe the parameters that drive the evolution in quantifiable terms . the evolution of millisecond pulsars can be consistently described in terms of * i ) * the equilibrium period distribution ( @xmath14 ) of millisecond x - ray pulsars at the end of the lmxb evolution * ii ) * the mass accretion rates ( @xmath15 ) of the progenitor population during the recycling process * iii ) * galactic birth rates ( @xmath16 ) , and * iv ) * the dominant energy loss mechanism after the onset of radio emission .",
    "we devise a semi - analytical evolution function @xmath17 to parametrize the evolution of millisecond pulsars after the accretion phase , which can be described in closed form as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the probability distribution function .",
    "the shape parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 define the distributions ( i.e. , @xmath22 for k=1,2,3 ) for the beta functions @xcite inferred from observations at each monte - carlo realization `` r '' .    the evolution function @xmath17 is built by randomly choosing initiation seeds from a period distribution @xmath14 , which is then convolved via the standard model to consequently sample the @xmath2 parameter space . for the observed millisecond x - ray pulsars , the period distribution which seeds will be randomly chosen from is the observed @xmath23 distribution ( table  1 ) .",
    "we uniquely construct a `` relaxed multidimensional kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) filter '' ( fig .  1 ) to check population consistencies by calculating the 2d k - s @xcite probabilities ( @xmath24 ) between observed millisecond radio pulsars and the synthetic population that is formed by these properly evolved progenitor seeds .",
    "the filtering is reiterated for each realization to obtain synthetic populations with consistent distributions .",
    "the filtered @xmath25 values are then convolved with standard dipole energy loss in order to construct the probability distribution function ( @xmath19 ) which is the integrated form of the proper @xmath26 pairs .",
    "nominally any @xmath27 value would imply consistent populations in a 2d k - s test . by allowing @xmath28 with lower fractions ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", we oversample outliers to compensate for possible statistical fluctuations and contaminations . a peak sampling rate around the nominal acceptance value of @xmath29 is the most optimal scheme that prevents strong biases due to over or under - sampling .",
    "the main goal for oversampling outliers and relaxing the k - s filter is to test whether the standard model can at least marginally produce very fast millisecond pulsars with relatively high magnetic fields like psr b1937 + 21 .    the predictive significance of the @xmath2 distribution for the probability map ( fig .",
    "2 ) is obtained from a monte - carlo run with @xmath30 valid realizations that produce consistent synthetic samples .",
    "whilst sampling the @xmath2 space , no assumptions were made regarding the progenitor period distribution ( @xmath14 ) , the accretion ( @xmath15 ) , or the galactic birth ( @xmath16 ) rates . the filter ( fig.1 ) is implicitly driven by the observed millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "figure 2 shows the expected @xmath2 distribution for the standard model assuming that millisecond radio pulsars have evolved from a progenitor population similar to the observed millisecond x - ray pulsars .",
    "we do not include millisecond radio pulsars in globular clusters because the @xmath2 values in these cases may not necessarily be the sole imprint of the binary evolution , but can be significantly changed by possible gravitational interactions due to the crowded field . to explore the extend of the effects of an unevenly sampled progenitor population , we also show the region in the @xmath2 space that is sensitive to alternative @xmath23 distributions .",
    "the probability map is overlaid with the observed millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "* young millisecond pulsars with higher magnetic fields ( e.g. psr b1937 + 21 ) are inconsistent with the standard model . the fraction of the observed young / old millisecond radio pulsars with high b fields is higher than what the standard model predicts by several orders of magnitude . * the fastest spinning millisecond pulsars , in particular psr b1937 + 21 , may originate from a different evolutionary channel . *",
    "the standard evolutionary model is able to produce the _ general _ demographics of older millisecond radio pulsars only .",
    "* accretion rates that millisecond radio pulsars have experienced during their accretion phase deduced from observed @xmath2 values , combined with the observed millisecond x - ray pulsar period distribution produces mostly older millisecond radio pulsars , including millisecond radio pulsars with spin - down ages @xmath31  yrs . figure 2 shows clearly that the apparent enigma of millisecond pulsars with spin - down ages older than the age of the galaxy is mainly a manifestation of very low accretion rates during the late stages of the lmxb evolution . *",
    "no physically motivated p distribution has been able to produce the whole millisecond radio pulsar population consistently .",
    "no millisecond x - ray pulsar period distribution could mimic the observed relative ratios of young / old pulsars with high b fields .",
    "* it is necessary to posit the existence of a separate class of progenitors , most likely with a different distribution of magnetic fields , accretion rates and equilibrium spin periods , presumably among the lmxbs that have not been revealed as millisecond x - ray pulsars .",
    "* a millisecond x - ray pulsar period distribution that has sharp multimodal features coupled with non - standard energy loss mechanisms may be able to reconcile for the joint @xmath2 distribution of millisecond pulsars .",
