    "engineered dissipation has already found useful applications for quantum state preparation , where the initial state is destroyed in the process of preparing a desired target state .",
    "in contrast , quantum error - correcting schemes need to preserve coherences in the initial state of a quantum system . since such quantum error correction inherently relies on dissipation to get rid of entropy , it naturally fits into the framework of engineered dissipation .",
    "the realization of dissipative protocols that are capable of manipulating non - orthogonal quantum states while maintaining their coherence is an essential step in the endeavor to perform autonomously stabilized quantum information processing tasks .",
