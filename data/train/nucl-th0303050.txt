    "it is now well recognized that an important challenge in nuclear research is to understand the hadron structure within quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) .",
    "one of the important information for pursuing this research is the electromagnetic and weak n-@xmath1 transition form factors .",
    "such information are important for testing current hadron models and perhaps also lattice qcd calculations in the near future .",
    "in particular , we can address the question about whether n and @xmath1 are deformed . if they are deformed , is it due to the gluon interactions between quarks or due to the pion cloud which is resulted from the spontaneously breaking of the chiral symmetry of qcd ?    as a step in this direction , we have developed@xcite in recent years a dynamical model for investigating the pion photoproduction and electroproduction reactions at energy near the @xmath1 resonance . the dynamical approach , which has also been pursued by several groups@xcite , is different from the approaches based on either dispersion relations@xcite or k - matrix method@xcite in interpreting the data . in refs.1 and 2 ,",
    "we not only have extracted the electromagnetic n-@xmath1 transition form factors from the data , but also have provided an interpretation of the extracted parameters in terms of hadron model calculations . in particular , we have shown that including the dynamical pion cloud effect in theoretical analyses can resolve a long - standing puzzle that the n-@xmath1 m1 transition form factor @xmath5 predicted by the constituent quark model is about 40 @xmath6 lower than the empirical value .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical pion cloud is found to play an important role in determining the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath7 which drops faster than the proton form factor @xmath8 as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the predicted electric e2 and coulomb c2 n-@xmath1 transition form factors , which exhibit very pronounced meson cloud effects at low @xmath3 , have stimulated some experimental initiatives@xcite .",
    "similar results were also obtained in ref.@xcite .    since weak currents are closely related to electromagnetic currents within the standard model , it is straightforward to extend our dynamical approach to study weak pion production reactions . in this paper",

    "our objective is to develop a framework for extracting the axial vector n-@xmath1 form factors from the data of neutrino - induced pion production reactions . in particular",
    ", we would like to explore whether a dynamical approach , as developed in our study of pion electroproduction , can also resolve a similar problem that the axial n-@xmath1 transition strength calculated@xcite from the constituent quark model is about 30 @xmath6 lower than what was extracted@xcite from the data .",
    "we will also make predictions for future experimental tests which could be conducted at fermi lab , kek and japan hadron facility in the near future .    to introduce our model ,",
    "it is necessary to first briefly review the dynamical approach developed in ref.@xcite ( called sl model ) .",

    "is used up to second order in @xmath14 to derive an effective hamiltonian .",
    "the essential idea of the employed unitary transformation method is to eliminate the unphysical vertex interactions @xmath15 with @xmath16 from the hamiltonian and absorb their effects into @xmath17 two - body interactions . for the pion production processes in the @xmath1 region ,",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is defined in a subspace spanned by the @xmath12 , @xmath18 and @xmath1 states and has the following form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a non - resonant @xmath12 potential , and @xmath21 describes the non - resonant @xmath22 transition .",

    "such a separation of the reaction mechanisms from the excitations of hadron internal structure is an essential ingredient of a dynamical approach , but is not an objective of the approaches based on either dispersion relations@xcite or k - matrix method@xcite .    in the above formulation",

    "guided by the effective chiral lagrangian method and using the similar procedures of the sl model , we can construct the axial vector currents @xmath45 for pion production reactions .",
    "the resulting axial current amplitude consists of nucleon - born , rho - exchange , pion - pole , and @xmath1 excitation terms and can be calculated using the parameters in the literatures . in particular , the bare axial n-@xmath1 transitions at @xmath2 are assumed to be those calculated by hemmert , holstein , and mukhopadhyay@xcite within the constituent quark model .",
    "most of the earlier theoretical investigations@xcite of weak pion production reactions were performed during the years around 1970 .",
    "the model which was most often used in analyzing the data was developed by adler@xcite .",

    "no vector meson exchanges are included .",
    "additional subtraction terms are added to remove the kinematic singularities of multipole amplitudes . in solving the dispersion relation equations ,",
    "only the @xmath46 phases are included to account for the unitarity condition via watson theorem and the imaginary parts of other multipole amplitudes are neglected .",
    "clearly , adler s approach needs improvements for a precise extraction of the axial n-@xmath1 from factors from the data .",
