    "hyperbranched polymers ( hp ) are macromolecules with a large number of branching units @xcite . in contrast to dendrimers , which are typically synthesized in multistep schemes , hp are created in single - step reactions @xcite , making them very attractive for applications @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the hp built from a reaction that allows cluster - cluster aggregation show scaling , whereas the ones created using a procedure where monomers are added sequentially to an existing core which strictly avoids cluster - cluster aggregation ( e.g. , dendrimers ) do not scale @xcite .",
    "we note that hp typically possess a high degree of structural polydispersity ; this , however , does not break the feature of possible scaling @xcite .",
    "therefore , deterministic fractal structures are a very useful tool to understand the properties of hp in depth @xcite .    the theory of hp dynamics has been intensively developed with the focus on mechanical relaxation , microrheology , and macroscopic dielectric relaxation @xcite .",
    "all these dynamic properties have a striking feature in common : in the generalized gaussian scheme ( ggs ) , they can be calculated based only on the eigenvalue spectrum of the connectivity matrix ( which describes the topology of the links between the monomers ) .",
    "the reason for this is that they typically represent macroscopic or structurally averaged properties .",
    "however , the dynamics of a monomer of a macromolecule is generally complex and influences its kinetics of binding with other reactants @xcite ; in the case of hp the local monomer dynamics could then be relevant for applications such as drug delivery @xcite or catalysis @xcite ( since the related processes of sorption and desorption would depend on the mobility of both the sorbed substance and the macromolecule s monomers ) .",
    "experimentally , the local dynamics can be studied by considering the local bond dynamics in nmr or dielectric relaxation experiments @xcite .",
    "but the related local dynamical functions then depend on the particular location of the segments in the macromolecular structure .",
    "consequently , the eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix ( and not only the eigenvalues ) influence the local dynamics , a fact that considerably complicates the computations of local dynamic functions in the case of large macromolecular sizes . to our knowledge",
    ", temporal autocorrelation functions of the spatial distance between monomers ( after disorder averaging ) have been investigated in the context of proteins in refs .",
    "@xcite , where they were shown to vary strongly with the chemical distance between the considered monomers .",
    "however , the dynamics of single segments , with focus on their location in the structure , has not been studied yet . here",
    "we look at very local scale represented through single bonds and , in particular , on the influence of the bonds location on their dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the local dynamics of single bonds in hp modeled through vicsek fractals ( vf ) , focusing on the local dielectric relaxation ( for type a polymers in stockmayer s classification @xcite , ) .",
    "we show that the dynamics of single segments strongly depends on their location in the macromolecule .",
    "remarkably , the imaginary part of the local dielectric susceptibility of the core segments shows a different scaling than the global ( structure - averaged ) dielectric susceptibility .",
    "indeed , while the dielectric susceptibility scales as @xmath0 for the overall structure @xcite ( with @xmath1 the spectral dimension of the structure and @xmath2 the frequency of an external electric field ) , we find that it scales as @xmath3 in the case of core segments . in order to have a reliable proof of this feature , we extend the iterative methods of ref .",

    "the reason for this behavior can be understood by looking on the examples illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : the relaxation time @xmath85 is related to the eigenmode in which two next nearest neighbor beads move with the same amplitude but against each other , while all other beads remain immobile @xcite .",
