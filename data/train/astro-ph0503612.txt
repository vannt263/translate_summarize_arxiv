    "since neutrinos have spin one half they are believed to obey fermi statistics . a serious argument in favor of this belief is an absence of a consistent quantum field theory of half - integer spin particles with any other statistics than the fermi one . for electrons and nucleons",
    "this issue has been discussed earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that a possible violation of statistics for these particles is strongly restricted by experiment . on the other hand , direct experimental checks of fermi statistics for neutrinos are absent , except for a study of the effects of purely bosonic neutrinos on big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) performed 10 years ago  @xcite .",
    "recently the idea that neutrinos may possess bose or mixed statistics reappeared in ref .",
    "@xcite where phenomenological analysis of testable effects has been presented .",
    "a violation of the spin - statistics relation for neutrinos would lead to a number of observable effects in cosmology and astrophysics . in particular , bosonic neutrinos might compose all or a part of the cold cosmological dark matter ( through bosonic condensate of neutrinos ) and simultaneously provide some hot dark matter  @xcite .",
    "a change of neutrino statistics , would have an impact on the evolution of supernovae and on the spectra of supernova neutrinos .",
    "the presence of a cosmological neutrino condensate would enhance contributions of the z - bursts to the flux of the ultra high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays and lead to substantial refraction effects for neutrinos from remote sources  @xcite .",
    "as shown in  @xcite the change of the neutrino statistics from fermi - dirac ( f - d ) to bose - einstein ( b - e ) leads to a decrease of the @xmath2he abundance produced during bbn by about 4% .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are in qualitative agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , however , according to the estimates of ref .  @xcite the change of @xmath2he is somewhat weaker .",
    "since the double beta decay excludes the possibility of pure bosonic neutrino  @xcite , but still allows mixed statistics , we will study here an influence of the partially bosonic neutrinos on bbn .",
    "we introduce the _ fermi - bose _ parameter , @xmath0 , which describes the continuous transition from fermi to bose distributions in thermal equilibrium as @xmath0 changes from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , the boundary cases corresponding to purely fermionic and bosonic states with any value of @xmath0 in between allowed .",
    "in particular , @xmath11 corresponds to boltzmann statistics .",
    "we consider possible constraints on the parameter @xmath0 from present and future bbn and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) plus large scale structure ( lss ) data .",
    "the form of the kinetic equation for particles with mixed statistics is not immediately evident .",
    "the statistics dependent factor @xmath12 $ ] under the collision integral e.g. for the reaction @xmath13 in the standard case of pure bose or fermi statistics has the form : @xmath14 where the @xmath15 signs correspond to bosons or fermions .",
    "derivation of the kinetic equation in general depends on the operator of particle number density and the normalization of states with non - zero number of identical particles .",
    "the quantum creation - annihilation operators of neutrinos obeying mixed statistics seems natural to write in the form : a_k & = & a_k^f + a_k^b , + a^+_k & = & a^f+_k + a^b+_k , [ fb ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the fermi and bose type operators annihilating states with momentum @xmath18 .",
    "however , the particle number operator in the standard form , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 defined in ( [ fb ] ) is not satisfactory if there are several identical particles with the same momenta .",
    "the emerging problems can be easily observed if one considers the matrix element of the particles number operator , @xmath21 , between the multiparticle states defined in the standard way , @xmath22 .",
    "this state is not an eigenstate of the operator @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , it is unclear if there exists an operator of the particle number with the appropriate properties , in particular commuting with the free hamiltonian .",
    "it may even be that one has to abandon the hamiltonian approach for description of mixed statistics particles .",
    "thus , at this stage we can only make a reasonable guess about the function @xmath23 .",
    "one simple possibility which has the correct limiting behavior in the case of pure statistics is to suggest that the neutrino distribution function in the final states of any reaction enters @xmath23 as g_^2 ( 1 - f _ )",
    "+ ^2 ( 1 + f _ ) , [ 1way ] where @xmath24 is the statistics mixing angle and @xmath25 is the neutrino distribution function , which in equilibrium interpolates between the f - d and b - e statistics , so that @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .    the natural assumption leading to eq .",
    "( [ 1way ] ) is that the outgoing neutrino contributes partly with a pauli blocking , @xmath30 , with weight @xmath31 , and partly with bose enhancement , @xmath32 , with weight @xmath33 .",
    "the angle @xmath24 introduced above should somehow be connected to the angle @xmath34 in the operator mixture ( [ fb ] ) .",
    "the equality @xmath35 looks as a reasonable hypothesis .",
    "if this is true then the angle @xmath34 which parametrizes a violation of neutrino statistics in double beta decay can be constrained from bbn and vice versa . if however , the angles @xmath34 and @xmath24 are different the bounds from bbn and @xmath36-decay are not directly related .    the distribution ( [ 1way ] ) can be rewritten as g_1 - f _ ( ) , [ 2way ] where ^2- ^2= 2which we call the _ fermi - bose _ parameter . thus , we suggest that the distribution of neutrinos in the final state enters the factor @xmath23 in the combination ( [ 2way ] ) . for example , in the case of elastic scattering @xmath37 the neutrino distribution functions with mixed statistics appear in the collision integral as f = & & f_(k_1 ) f_l ( p_1 ) [ 1-f_l ( p_2 ) ] + & & - f_(k_2 ) f_l ( p_2 ) [ 1-f_l ( p_1 ) ] .",
    "[ i - coll ] the same factor @xmath38 appears ( instead of @xmath39 ) in any process involving mixed statistics neutrinos .",
    "considering the processes of neutrino scattering and production we have found that the factor @xmath40 , and consequently , the collision integral , vanish if f",
    "_ = f^(eq)_= ^-1 , [ f - mixed ] while all other particle distributions are given by the standard equilibrium bose or fermi functions .",
    "that means that @xmath41 given by eq .",
    "( [ f - mixed ] ) is the equilibrium distribution function for the case of mixed statistics of neutrinos .",
    "for @xmath42 the function @xmath43 turns into the fermi distribution , for @xmath44 it turns into the bose equilibrium distribution , while for @xmath45 , _",
    "i.e. _ for equal mixture of fermi and bose statistics , it becomes the boltzmann one .    in fig .",
    "[ ffnu ] we present the equilibrium distributions ( [ f - mixed ] ) for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "according to this figure the distribution becomes softer with an increase of the bosonic fraction .",
    "the maximum number density shifts to smaller @xmath46 , and the integrated number density increases .    for a positive @xmath0 ( when the fermionic component dominates )",
    "the distribution function @xmath47 is bounded from above by @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath0 is negative , then for a large lepton asymmetry a neutrino condensation would be possible .",
    "indeed , for a given @xmath0 , the maximum allowed value of the chemical potential is ^(max ) = m_- t ( - ) , [ mumax ] this follows from the condition that @xmath47 should be non - negative . in particular , for the purely bosonic case we obtain the usual bound @xmath49 .",
    "if the neutrino charge asymmetry is so large that @xmath50 could not provide it , the neutrinos would form a bose condensate with the equilibrium distribution function equal to f^(eq ) = + c ( * k * ) .",
    "[ f - chem ] here @xmath51 is the three momentum of the neutrino , and @xmath52 is a constant whose magnitude is determined by the value of the charge asymmetry of the neutrinos .    an interesting question to address is how unique is the distribution ( [ f - mixed ] ) .",
    "can one introduce other forms of the mixed statistics equilibrium distributions ?",
    "an alternative to ( 3 ) could be g_^2 ( 1 - f_fd ) + ^2 ( 1 + f_be ) .",
    "[ 3way ] such kinetics is equivalent to having two independent neutrino species , bosonic and fermionic , and , if equilibrium is established , it would lead to @xmath53 neutrino species ( see next section ) . to avoid equilibrium the bound on @xmath24 in this case",
    "would be quite restrictive .",
    "the effect of the change of neutrino statistics on bbn is related to two phenomena .",
    "first , the energy density of bosons in equilibrium ( @xmath44 ) is larger than the energy density of fermions by the factor 8/7 .",
    "if all three neutrinos have b - e statistics , their larger energy density would correspond to an increase of the effective number of neutrino species by @xmath54 .",
    "the second , dominant , effect is an increase of the rate of the reactions of neutron - to - proton transformations due to the bosonic ( anti blocking ) factor @xmath55 . because of the larger rate the freezing temperature of these reactions would be lower and",
    "consequently the frozen @xmath56-ratio would be smaller .",
    "it can be mimicked by a decrease of @xmath57 .",
    "the first effect can be approximately described as @xmath58 , while the second one is noticeably non - linear ( exponential ) .",
    "we performed the calculations of the abundances of light elements with the kawano nucleosynthesis code  @xcite which was modified to include the effects of mixed statistics of neutrinos described by the distribution ( [ f - mixed ] ) .",
    "this code  @xcite is accurate enough for calculations of the relative changes of the abundances , while for the absolute values of the abundances we use the results of a more precise modern code  @xcite . as a reference value of the baryon number density",
    "we take the wmap result  @xcite , @xmath59 .",
    "the results of the computations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : k ] and [ fig : deut ] . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : k ] we present the change of the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath60 , as a function of @xmath0 , which is equivalent to a decrease of the @xmath61he primordial abundance .",
    "if the neutrinos have a purely bosonic distribution ( @xmath62 ) , the effect is similar to having @xmath63 .",
    "however , the effect of modified statistics can not be described by a simple change in @xmath57 if other light elements are included . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 the relative changes of the abundances of @xmath64h , @xmath61he , and @xmath65li with @xmath0 are shown .",
    "as expected the mass fraction of @xmath61he drops down and for pure bosonic neutrinos we get the relative decrease about - 1 = - 3.2% .",
    "this is slightly smaller than the value @xmath66% found in @xcite .",
    "the amount of @xmath64h goes up with decrease of @xmath0 .",
    "a higher deuterium abundance can be explained by a slower conversion rate of deuterium to heavier elements due to fewer neutrons and higher expansion rate at bbn epoch when @xmath67k . in the pure bosonic case",
    "the increase is about 2.6 % .",
    "the @xmath65li abundance decreases with @xmath0 , and for @xmath44 the decrease is about 7% .",
    "let us confront the absolute values of the abundances for partly bosonic neutrinos with observational results .",
    "we will use the relative changes presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : k ] and the central values of the abundances calculated for usual f - d neutrinos in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "other codes may give even slightly larger values for the helium abundance ( g. steigman , private communication ) .",
    "we are here ( and in the figures ) using the symbol @xmath71 for the abundance of @xmath72 or @xmath73 ratios to @xmath74 by number , not by mass . at @xmath62",
    "we find for @xmath61he : @xmath75 , which makes much better agreement with the value extracted from observations ( for a review of the latter see _ e.g. _",
    "different helium observations yield different results , _",
    "e.g. _ , the ref .",
    "@xcite finds @xmath76 , and ref .",
    "@xcite finds @xmath77 ( @xmath78 , only statistical error - bars ) .",
    "these results are shown in figure 2 as the skew hatched regions , where the upper ( magenta ) is the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and the lower ( yellow ) is the results of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "whether the existing helium observations are accurate or slightly systematically shifted will be tested with future cmb observations  @xcite .",
    "the amount of @xmath64h rises at most to @xmath79 , and the agreement between bbn and wmap data remains good , bearing in mind the observational uncertainties .",
    "primordial @xmath65li drops down to @xmath80 , again slightly diminishing the disagreement between theory and observations .",
    "we see that at the present time bbn does not exclude even a pure bosonic nature of all three neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , the agreement between the value of the baryonic mass density , @xmath81 , inferred from cmbr and the predicted abundances of @xmath61he , @xmath64h , and @xmath65li becomes even better .",
    "in other words , in the standard bbn model there is an indication of disagreement between observations of @xmath61he and @xmath64h - they correspond to different values of @xmath81 with the observed abundances of @xmath61he indicating a smaller value of @xmath81 than the one given by cmbr , while @xmath64h agrees with cmbr .",
    "motivated by these results the value of @xmath82 was suggested in ref .  @xcite . in the case of predominantly bosonic neutrinos , as discussed above , the discrepancy between @xmath64h , @xmath61he , and cmbr disappears .",
    "when the problem of large systematic uncertainties of primordial helium determinations will be resolved and the statistical error - bars will dominate the error - budget , one can expect to measure @xmath57 with an accuracy at the level of 0.1 .",
    "this would exclude @xmath83 , if an agreement with the standard bbn values is found .",
    "otherwise , if the discrepancy between @xmath61he and @xmath64h remains it may be considered as an indication to the mixed statistics of neutrinos .",
    "our results change only slightly with variation of the baryon number density @xmath81 , as seen in fig",
    "the upper panel shows the ratio of abundances for purely bosonic to purely fermionic neutrinos .",
    "the changes are always of the order a few percent for the 3 abundances considered .",
    "the results are in good agreement with ref .",
    "the vertically hatched ( cyan ) region shows the @xmath84 wmap result .",
    "the lower panel shows the absolute value of the @xmath61he abundance as a function of @xmath81 , for purely bosonic , boltzmann , and purely fermionic neutrino distribution functions . for other values of @xmath0",
    ", the result will be in between those lines , and can be obtained using curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : k ] . the skew hatched ( yellow ) region shows the range of observed values of the helium abundance from refs .",
    "@xcite , which marginally overlap at @xmath78 .",
    "+ it is well known that cmb can be used to constrain the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of photon decoupling ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for cmb and lss , in contrast to bbn , the presence of the bosonic neutrinos increases the number of degrees of freedom from @xmath85 to @xmath86 as @xmath0 goes from @xmath10 to @xmath9 .",
    "the present bounds from cmb and lss data are insensitive to such changes and too weak to constrain the fermi - bose parameter  ( see  @xcite for references ) .",
    "the planck experiment is forecast to constrain the relativistic degrees of freedom to the level @xmath87  @xcite at @xmath78 .",
    "this means that planck alone will be able to measure @xmath0 with a precision of about @xmath88 .",
    "in particular , a pure bosonic distribution function for neutrinos can be excluded at about @xmath84 level . an `` ambitious '' future experiment ( see details in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for earlier predictions see  @xcite ) will constrain @xmath89 to about @xmath90 , which corresponds to a determination of @xmath0 with precision @xmath91 at @xmath78 .",
    "+ it is known from cosmological considerations that the mass of fermionic hot neutrinos are bounded from above by approximately 1 ev , for recent studies see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this bound is applicable to any hot dark matter particle , independently of their statistics , which have the same number density as that of neutrinos .",
    "for particles which have different number densities , or freeze out at different times , this number changes somewhat  @xcite . since large scale structure basically constrains the quantity _",
    "= where @xmath92 is the number density of a thermal fermionic neutrino , then bosonic neutrinos will have their masses constrained a factor 4/3 weaker than fermionic neutrinos .",
    "we thus see that cosmological probes of neutrino masses remain roughly as strong as always , in comparison to terrestrial tritium or double beta decay experiments .",
    "in addition to the thermal neutrino component bosonic neutrinos might condense in the early universe and have much larger number density than thermal relics , as argued in ref .",
    "however , the cosmological upper bound on their mass would remain practically the same because the latter is valid only for hot thermal relics which suppress structure formation at small scales .",
    "the higher number density of bosonic neutrinos will imply a marginally later freeze out , and hence a larger sharing of the entropy from the annihilating electrons than in the standard scenario  @xcite .",
    "this effect is , however , very small .",
    "more general non - thermal neutrino spectra and the effect on freeze out is studied in @xcite .",
    "let us comment on a possibility of large neutrino condensate in the case of partly bosonic neutrinos .",
    "such a condensate would contribute as cold dark matter in the universe ( and show up in the cmb and lss analysis ) .",
    "the condensate is formed when the lepton asymmetry is larger than that which could be ensured by the maximal possible chemical potential . in the case of pure bosonic neutrinos",
    "the chemical potential is restricted by the neutrino mass and is therefore negligible , especially at the bbn epoch .",
    "in contrast , in the case of partly bosonic neutrinos the maximal potential given by ( [ mumax ] ) , or @xmath93 , can be large .",
    "so , in the case of partly bosonic neutrinos , the formation of the condensate would imply a large chemical potential , which could destroy the excellent agreement with bbn .",
    "due to mixing between the active neutrinos the chemical potentials should be equal for all 3 neutrino species at the time of bbn  @xcite . then using the strong bound on the leptonic asymmetry in the electron neutrinos we find the bound @xmath94 : for @xmath95 such a chemical potential for the electron neutrinos will significantly underproduce helium , leading to a disagreement with observations . for negative chemical potential @xmath96 would be strongly overproduced leading to essentially the same bound , @xmath94 .",
    "that is , neutrinos should be almost purely bosonic to produce the condensate and satisfy the bbn bound .",
    "on the other hand , almost purely bosonic neutrinos are excluded ( disfavored ) by the double beta decay  @xcite : the mixing angle @xmath97 at the level @xmath98 is still allowed , however , the angle @xmath97 is not necessarily equal to @xmath24 introduced above . notice further that the relation of @xmath0 with the fermi - bose parameter relevant for the @xmath99 -decay is not clear , as discussed in section  2 .",
    "anyway , an improvement of the bbn bound on @xmath0 can exclude a possibility of the neutrino condensate which might contribute substantially to the cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "we find the equilibrium distribution function for partially bosonic neutrinos which depends on a single _ fermi - bose _",
    "parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "the change of this parameter from @xmath10 to @xmath9 corresponds to a continuous transition between fermi and bose distributions .",
    "we have considered the influence of bosonic or partially bosonic neutrinos on bbn . in the extreme case of completely or predominantly bosonic neutrinos the primordial abundances",
    "change in comparison with the usual f - d cases in the following way : @xmath61he decreases by 3.2% , @xmath64h increases by 2.6% and @xmath65li decreases by 7% .",
    "the agreement between theory and observations becomes noticeably better .",
    "future determinations of @xmath61he will allow to exclude values of fermi - bose parameter @xmath100 , if agreement with the standard case is found .",
    "the bbn bounds on @xmath0 can be compatible with those obtained from the analysis of two neutrino double beta decay  @xcite .",
    "future cmb+lss observations can constrain or observe this parameter , possibly to the level @xmath91 , potentially providing indications of a violation of the pauli exclusion principle .",
