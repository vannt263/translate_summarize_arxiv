    "weak lensing measurements by surveys such as cosmos @xcite and cfhtls @xcite have afforded the use of shear correlation functions and power spectra in order to test cosmology .    in parallel",
    ", the problem of cosmic acceleration has motivated explorations of new theoretical ideas , including the possibility that gr may be modified on large scales .",
    "anticipating the substantial improvement in cosmological data sets that is expected with surveys such as des @xcite , pan - starrs @xcite , lsst @xcite and euclid @xcite , model - independent frameworks for testing gr against observations of the growth of cosmic structures have been developed @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been progress towards a consensus on what properties such a framework should have @xcite .",
    "first , it should be general , i.e. it should be able to describe a wide range of modified gravity models .",
    "second , it should not violate the consistency of super - horizon sized perturbations with the background expansion .",
    "third , it should involve as few parameters as possible , while still being flexible enough to capture most of the significant information contained in the data .",
    "a good pragmatic starting point is to look for evidence of departures in the fundamental relationships among the perturbative fields familiar in cosmology : matter density and velocity perturbations , and the metric perturbations @xcite .",
    "it is commonly agreed that one needs two general functions of scale and time , in addition to the conservation of energy - momentum , to specify the evolution of the linear perturbations .",
    "for example , one can introduce @xmath0 , relating the gravitational potential to the density contrast , and @xmath1 , which relates the gravitational potential to the spatial curvature . given these functions , it is possible to calculate the cosmological perturbations and all the observables with a full boltzmann integration code , such as mgcamb @xcite .",
    "the actual parametrization of the functions has not yet been researched as fully .",
    "the goal is to strike a balance between simplicity , i.e. working with as few parameters as possible , and allowing for enough flexibility in these functions to capture all of the information contained in the data .",
    "for example , one can discretize @xmath4 and @xmath5 on a grid in @xmath6 space and treat their values at each grid point , which we will call _ pixels _ , as independent parameters @xcite . motivated by simplicity",
    ", one might wish to start with the simplest possible model , such as constant values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and add complexity only if the fitted parameter values of this simple model show hints of departure from @xmath3cdm .",
    "however , this logic may not work in modified gravity studies and might lead to missing important information contained in the data . as the pca analysis in @xcite shows , the shapes of the well constrained eigenmodes suggest a higher sensitivity to scale - dependent features in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , compared to their average values or the time dependence .    in this work ,",
    "we first use a fisher forecast - based pca to determine the minimum number of pixels necessary to describe the shape of the best constrained eigenmodes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we then use a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) algorithm to fit these parameters to a combination of the available data , including cmb , isw , sne and wl , and find constraints on their de - correlated combinations . throughout the paper we assume that the background expansion is given by the flat @xmath3cdm model which is strongly favored by the current constraints on the expansion history , and look for deviations from its predictions for the density perturbations . from a theoretical perspective , flatness is motivated by the inflationary origin of the universe , and the viable models of modified gravity studied in the literature tend to be indistinguishable from @xmath3cdm at the background level .",
    "other tests of gr have been performed , in which different choices were made for the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( or a related set of parameters ) .",
    "in @xcite they were taken to have a specific form of time dependence , while in @xcite they have a specific form of time and scale dependence ; finally , @xcite allowed them to vary in three redshift bins .",
    "the results of these studies show a good consistency with @xmath3cdm . to compare with the results of some of these studies , we consider a single - transition - in - redshift model in addition to our scale - dependent pca method , generally finding a good agreement with gr .",
    "in addition to allowing for scale - dependence , other important differences between our study and the treatment in @xcite include using the isw cross - correlation data , using the cfhtls wl data coming only from linear and mildly non - linear scales , and simultaneously varying two functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while @xcite varied them one at a time when working with a @xmath7-bin model .",
    "the key conceptual difference from @xcite is that we do not use wl data from a deeply non - linear regime , and we do not assume a specific scale and time dependence of the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but rather perform a pca of their values on a gird in @xmath6 .",
    "we find that the agreement with @xmath3cdm is statistically more significant when no scale - dependence is allowed . after performing a pca",
    ", we find that seven of the eight eigenmodes are consistent with gr within the errors .",
    "one eigenmode shows a @xmath2 deviation from the gr prediction , but can be directly traced to a feature in the wl aperture mass dispersion spectrum at @xmath8 arc min , which is most likely caused by a systematic @xcite .",
    "however , the detection of this effect shows the benefits of adopting a more flexible scale - dependent pixellation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and demonstrates that using scale - independent methods could potentially hinder the detection of new physics , or , as in this case , simply the better understanding of the data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] reviews the data sets used in this work . after describing our parametrization in section  [ sec : para ] , we present the constraints on departures from gr in section  [ sec : results ] , and finally draw conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section , we summarize the observables that will be used to constrain deviations from gr , and explain the data sets for these observables .      the isw effect @xcite is a secondary anisotropy of the cmb which is created whenever the gravitational potentials are evolving in time .",
    "this is due to the net energy gain that the cmb photons acquire when traveling through varying potential wells , and it is therefore a direct probe of the derivatives of the potentials @xmath9 . in more detail",
    ", this effect generates additional cmb temperature anisotropies in any direction @xmath10 given by _",
    "( ) ( ) = - ( + ) d , where @xmath11 is the conformal time , the dot represents a conformal time derivative and the integral is calculated along the line of sight of the photon .",
    "a direct measurement of this effect is difficult , due to the overlap with the primary cmb anisotropies , whose amplitude is at least 10 times bigger .",
    "an additional problem is that the isw signal is biggest on the largest angular scales , which are most affected by cosmic variance .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to detect this signal by cross - correlating the full cmb with some tracers of the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe @xcite : the primary cmb signal , generated at early times , is expected to have null correlation with the lss , while the isw anisotropies , produced at low redshift , correlate with the lss distributions since they trace the fluctuations in the potentials .",
    "we can then use a galaxy survey with visibility function @xmath12 as a tracer of the lss , and we can write the galaxy density fluctuation in a direction @xmath13 as _ g ( _ 1 ) = b_g ( z ) ( z ) _ m ( _ 1 , z ) dz , where @xmath14 is the galaxy bias and @xmath15 the matter density perturbation . on the other hand , the isw temperature anisotropy in a direction @xmath16",
    "is given by _",
    "( _ 2 ) = - e^-(z ) ( + ) ( _ 2 , z ) dz , where @xmath17 is the photons visibility function and @xmath18 the optical depth . after choosing a particular data set for the cmb and the lss",
    ", we can then define the auto- and cross - correlation functions as c^tg ( ) & & ( _ 1 ) _ g ( _ 2 ) + c^gg ( ) & & _ g ( _ 1 ) _ g ( _ 2 ) , where @xmath19 is the full cmb temperature anisotropy and the averages are calculated over all pairs at an angular separation @xmath20 . alternatively , the above calculation can be written in harmonic space , and the auto- and cross - power spectra are then derived .",
    "we use the isw data from @xcite , which were obtained by cross - correlating multiple galaxy catalogs with the cmb maps from wmap .",
    "the data used trace the distribution of the lss in various bands of the electromagnetic spectrum , with median redshifts @xmath21 , and consist of six catalogs ( infrared 2mass , visible sdss main galaxies , luminous red galaxies and quasars , radio nvss , and x - ray heao ) .",
    "this is an approximation of a true tomographic study of the isw signal .",
    "all maps were pixellated on the sphere , with a pixel size of 0.9 deg .",
    "the measurements were done in real space , calculating the angular cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) between the maps .",
    "these were linearly binned in steps of 1 deg for angles @xmath22 deg @xmath23 deg ; so the data set consists of 78 points @xmath24 .",
    "a well known property of the correlation functions is that their data points are highly correlated ; in this case , in particular , the high degree of correlation is present also between data points belonging to different catalogs , due to the partial overlaps in redshift and in sky coverage of the sources .",
    "for this reason , the full covariance matrix between all data points @xmath25 is a very important piece of information , and it was estimated in @xcite using several monte carlo and jack - knife methods .",
    "here we use the matrix produced with the most complete technique , a full monte carlo method where both galaxies and cmb maps were simulated and then correlated to measure the expected noise and covariance .",
    "the calculation of the likelihood of a particular model given the isw data is done as follows .",
    "first , the theoretical ccfs @xmath26 and auto - correlation functions ( acfs ) are calculated with a full boltzmann integration within mgcamb , based on the redshift distributions of the sources .",
    "the galaxy bias parameters are assumed to be independent and constant for each catalog , and are rescaled for each model imposing that the acfs on small angular scales match the observations .",
    "finally , the theoretical ccfs are multiplied by this rescaled bias to calculate the @xmath27 distribution , given by ^2 _ & = & _ ij _ ij + &  & .      for the sne data",
    ", we use the sample combination labeled @xmath28 shown in table 4 of @xcite , which is a compilation of the sdss - ii sne sample plus nearby sne , essence , snls and hst . to calculate the sne likelihood , we use values from the mlcs2k2 light curve fitter , and",
    "marginalize over the nuisance parameter , which is the calibration uncertainty in measuring the supernova intrinsic magnitude .",
    "note that @xcite found a discrepancy of the constraints on the f@xmath29cdm model ( standard cdm model in a flat universe plus a dark energy component with a constant @xmath29 ) using the two sne fitters mlcs2k2 and salt - ii .",
    "however , the discrepancy is much smaller ( within @xmath30 ) for a flat @xmath3cdm model as shown in tables 13 and 17 in @xcite , namely , & & = 0.3120.022(stat)0.001(syst )  ( mlcs2k2 ) + & & = 0.2790.019(stat)0.017(syst )  ( salt - ii)since we will assume the background evolution is the same as that in the flat @xmath3cdm model , the choice of the sne fitter does not affect our final results significantly , but we should bear in mind that systematic errors are now comparable to statistical errors in sne observations .    for the cosmic microwave background data in our analysis , we use the wmap five - year data including the temperature and polarization power spectra  @xcite , and calculate the likelihood using the routine supplied by the wmap team .",
    "we use the cosmic shear observations from the cfhtls - wide third year data release t0003  @xcite , in which about @xmath31 galaxies with @xmath32-magnitudes between @xmath33 and @xmath34 were imaged on 57 sq .",

    "since it is difficult to model the weak lensing nonlinearity in modified gravity in a model - independent way  @xcite , we only use the aperture - mass dispersion data measured between @xmath42 and @xmath43 arc min , to remove the strongly nonlinear region from the data . for angles smaller than @xmath44 ,",
    "the difference between linear and non - linear predictions becomes greater than a factor of two , and we do not wish to suppose that non - linear corrections are reliable on smaller scales .    theoretically , the aperture - mass dispersion is related to the weak lensing power spectrum via  @xcite [ eq : map ] m_ap^2 ( ) = p _ ( ) ^2 , for the choice of filter in @xcite ; here , the lensing power spectrum @xmath45 is a projection of the 3d matter - density power spectrum @xmath46 , weighted by the source galaxy redshift distribution and geometric factors , and @xmath47 is the bessel function of the first kind .",

    "finally , we impose @xmath56 gaussian priors on the hubble parameter and baryon density of @xmath57 and @xmath58 from the measurements of hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite and big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite respectively , and a top hat prior on the cosmic age of 10 gyr @xmath59 20 gyr .",

    "in order to test gravity against the growth of cosmological perturbations in a model - independent way , one needs a generalized set of equations to evolve linear perturbations without assuming gr .",
    "we work within the framework of the boltzmann integrator mgcamb @xcite  ] , which is a variant of camb @xcite  .",
    "this is based on a system of equations that allows for a general modification of gravity at linear order in the perturbations , while respecting the consistency of the dynamics of long - wavelength perturbations with the background expansion @xcite .",
    "an interested reader can find a detailed discussion of the equations used in mgcamb and their comparison with other methods in the literature in @xcite .",
    "we consider scalar metric perturbations about a frw background for which the line element in the conformal newtonian gauge reads [ metric ] ds^2=-a^2()[(1 + 2)d^2-(1 - 2 ) d^2 ]  , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are functions of time and space .",
    "we assume adiabatic initial conditions and covariant conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of matter .",

    "this is natural in the existing models of modified gravity that aim to explain the late - time acceleration , where departures from gr occur at around the present day horizon scale . also , the success in explaining the bbn and cmb physics relies on gr being valid at high redshifts .",

    "there is no physical reason to assume that departures from gr ought to be scale - independent , and a pca forecast analysis  @xcite actually showed that the scale - dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is better constrained than their average values or the time - dependence .",

    "namely , we use @xmath130 to rotate the original parameters , denoted by the vector @xmath38 , into new uncorrelated parameters @xmath131 defined as [ eq : q ] q_i=-1+_jw_ijp_j/_jw_ij .",
    "in gr one has @xmath132 , since @xmath133 , therefore we can test gr by performing a null test on @xmath131 . by construction ,",
    "the eigenvectors are orthogonal and the @xmath134 s have uncorrelated errors given by the inverses of the eigenvalues .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : pca2 ]",
    "we have tested gr with current cosmological data , using a framework in which the departures from gr are encoded as modifications of the anisotropy and poisson equations ; these equations specify , respectively , how the metric perturbations relate to each other , and how they are sourced by perturbations in the energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "the modifications were parametrized with two functions @xmath135 ( or alternatively @xmath136 ) that reduce to unity in gr .",
    "we have then explored the constraints on these functions in two ways .",
    "first , we have allowed them to evolve from unity at high redshifts to a different value today in a scale - independent way .",
    "second , we have _ pixelized them in both scale and redshift _ and performed a principal component analysis ( pca ) , following the ideas of @xcite  a first general study of this kind .",
    "specifically , we have used a @xmath137 pixellation for each function , thus having @xmath126 modified gravity parameters . in order to remove the covariance between the bins , and",
    "to analyze which modes are best constrained , we have then performed a 2d pca of the results , obtaining constraints on the @xmath126 derived de - correlated parameters .",
    "we have used currently available data constraining both the background expansion history and the evolution of scalar perturbations in the universe . in particular , we have used a combined measurement of the isw effect through correlation of galaxies with cmb , the latest available supernovae type ia data including those from the sdss , the cmb temperature and polarization spectra from wmap5 , and weak lensing data from the cfhtls shear catalog . we have kept the analysis conservative by excluding small - scale data in the strongly non - linear regime , and we have checked and excluded possible tensions between the data sets by analyzing them individually before combining them .    throughout the paper , we have assumed a flat @xmath3cdm background and tried to constrain deviations from gr in the evolution of matter and metric perturbations . in the simplest case , where the mg functions @xmath138 were allowed a single transition in redshift , we have found no evidence for a departure from gr , in agreement with other works .",
    "we find that the isw effect , probed through the cmb auto - correlation and the cross - correlation with galaxy maps , currently gives the strongest constraint on @xmath76 because it is sensitive to the change of the lensing potential , @xmath139 , at the transition .    in the pixellated case , we have found that one of the pca eigenmodes shows a @xmath140 deviation from gr . however , this anomalous mode is due to the `` bump '' feature in the cfhtls lensing data , which is most likely due to a systematic effect  @xcite , combined with a preference for higher @xmath141 by the sne data .",
    "a separate analysis which does not include wl data shows indeed good agreement with gr . a better understanding of systematic effects in both wl and sne data sets needs to be achieved before any such discrepancy is viewed as a deviation from gr .",
    "even though this is most likely due to a known systematic effect , we emphasize that we would not have found this deviation if @xmath76 were taken to be scale - independent . in such case , the change in @xmath76 would be significantly constrained by the isw effect .",
    "the pca analysis using two bins in @xmath142 for @xmath76 could successfully isolate the strong constraint from the isw effect and pick up a feature in wl .",
    "this demonstrates that the same data can lead to a higher level of detection of deviations from an expected model if more flexibility is allowed in the parametrization .",
    "thus , when fitting @xmath4 and @xmath5 to data , it is important that their parametrization allows for some scale - dependence . otherwise , one might risk missing a systematic effect or a real departure from gr , and thus would not be exploiting the true discovery potential of the data .    finally , we comment on other recent studies that reported constraints on deviations from gr using current cosmological observations . in @xcite , the cosmos weak lensing tomography data @xcite were used together with sne , cmb , bao and the isw - galaxy cross correlation .",
    "@xcite found that the constraints from cmb+sne+cfhtls without cosmos were indistinguishable from those including cosmos and they did not find any deviations from gr .",
    "they argued that the sky coverage of cfhtls is more important than the redshift depth of cosmos .",
    "also it should be noted that weak lensing measurements in cosmos are made on strongly non - linear scales and there is an ambiguity in modeling the non - linear power spectrum .    in @xcite , a similar set of data to",
    "that described here was used to constrain two functions that are combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the differences between our study and that of @xcite include : ( 1 ) we used the isw cross - correlation data ; ( 2 ) we excluded small - scale modes in the cfhtls data to avoid the strongly non - linear regime ; ( 3 ) we simultaneously constrained two functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 while @xcite varied only one of the parameters when they use 3 bins in @xmath55 ; ( 4 ) scale dependence was allowed in our paper ; and ( 5 ) we used the fisher matrix based pca approach to make a decision on how many pixels to use .",
    "their results are qualitatively consistent with the result of our first parametrization .",
    "further improvements of this technique will be possible with a new generation of lss data ( e.g. des , pan - starrs , lsst , euclid ) , which will dramatically increase the number of modes with sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "finally , peculiar velocity data will provide an additional valuable probe for our approach , since they can constrain @xmath0 directly  @xcite , thus breaking the @xmath76-@xmath0 degeneracy .",
    "we are grateful to liping fu , martin kilbinger and yannick mellier for permission to use the cfhtls data in this paper , and to catherine heymans , ludovic van waerbeke and ismael tereno for valuable comments on an earlier version of the draft .",
