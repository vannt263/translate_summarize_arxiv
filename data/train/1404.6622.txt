    "ultracold atoms provides an ideal platform to investigate and simulate many - body problems of condensed - matter physics , e.g. , the mott insulator transition @xcite , magnetic phase transition @xcite , because of their unprecedented controllability in purity and interatomic interactions .",
    "there are a number of tools now available to tune the interatomic interactions , such as magnetic and optical feshbach resonances , optical lattices , etc .",
    "the magnetic feshbach resonance - resulting from the hyperfine coupling between two atomic states ( i.e. , open channel ) and a molecular state ( closed channel ) near zero energy - have been widely used @xcite , allowing the realization of the long - sought crossover from a molecular bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) to a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid and the investigation of interesting few - body physics such as efimov effects @xcite .",
    "the interaction between atoms can be also tuned by laser light near photo - association transition , when two free atoms couple to an excited molecular state @xcite .",
    "this so - called optical feshbach resonance has been experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "compared with the magnetic feshbach resonance , optical feshbach resonance could be used to control the interatomic interaction with high temporal and spatial flexibility .",
    "in addition , the optical transition between atomic states and molecular states is always available for most atomic species .",
    "hence , optical feshbach resonance becomes crucial to control the interatomic interaction for alkaline - earth atoms because of the lack of magnetic structure in their ground states @xcite . in a recent experiment of optical feshbach resonance , optical standing wave",
    "is used to couple atomic and molecular states of ytterbium-174 atoms , leading to a spatially modulated interaction between atoms @xcite .",
    "theoretically , this spatially modulated interatomic interaction was understood by using a two - channel model @xcite .",
    "future experiments on , e.g. , the simulation of hawking radiation in cold atoms @xcite , the emission of solitons @xcite , the dynamics of bec collapse @xcite , the localized to delocalized transition of solitons @xcite , and the phase separation of bose and fermi gases @xcite , all resulting from spatially varying interactions , may benefit from the control of interatomic interactions with high spatial and temporal resolutions .",
    "however , due to the large light - induced atomic loss , the use of optical feshbach resonance is greatly limited . to reduce the loss ,",
    "it has been proposed to use alkaline - earth atoms with narrow inter - combination line - width @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may optically control a magnetic feshbach resonance by using a bound - to - bound transition between two molecular states @xcite or by using a molecular dark state @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the shift of the magnetic feshbach resonance position and the modification of the two - body @xmath0-wave scattering length due to the bound - to - bound transition have been demonstrated for both atomic bose @xcite and fermi gases @xcite , by using spatially uniform laser light .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the optical control of a magnetic feshbach resonance by using spatially _ varying _",
    "( i.e. , standing - wave - like ) laser light , which drives the bound - to - bound transition between a ground molecular state and an excited molecular state .",
    "this scheme can directly be implemented in current experiments @xcite by replacing the uniform laser light with a standing - wave light .",
    "it offers the ability to tune the interatomic interactions with a spatial modulation at the sub - micron level .",
    "compared with the previous spatial modulation of interatomic interactions with optical feshbach resonance @xcite , the major advantage of our scheme is that the optical induced atomic loss would be significantly suppressed @xcite . as a result , our proposal provides a practical way to experimentally realize spatially modulated interatomic interactions , for the purpose of simulating related many - body problems .",
    "as we shall see , our scheme also has the advantage of tuning the _ width _ of feshbach resonances , with a great flexibility .",
