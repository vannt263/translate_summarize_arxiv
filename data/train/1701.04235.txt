    "the problem of gravitational collapse of massive stars received a substantial amount of attention for many years , ever since the first significant work in this connection by oppenheimer and snyder @xcite .",
    "a spacetime singularity is expected to form as an end - state of a continual gravitational collapse .",
    "though the general speculation is that an event horizon would form and shield this singular state from a distant observer , there are examples with quite reasonable physical conditions , where no horizon can form and the singularity remains exposed , maybe forever , giving rise to what is known as a naked singularity .",
    "therefore it is of great importance to investigate what an unhindered gravitational collapse can lead to . for a systematic exposition of various aspects of gravitational collapse and its possible outcome",
    ", we refer to the discussions by joshi @xcite .",
    "+ a recent upsurge of interest in scalar field cosmology is driven by the observational evidence of accelerated expansion of the universe and thus the need for an exotic matter component , called dark energy , which can provide an effective negative pressure @xcite . a scalar field with a positive potential can indeed serve this purpose .",
    "the distribution of the dark energy vis - a - vis the distribution of the fluid remains unclear except perhaps the dogma that it does not cluster at any scale below the hubble scale .",
    "an exhaustive investigation regarding a scalar field collapse might lead to some hint towards the possible clustering of the dark energy .",
    "for instance , the spherical collapse model was studied by mota and bruck @xcite in the context of dark energy cosmologies , in which dark energy was modelled as a minimally coupled scalar field for different popular interaction potentials . moreover , formally a scalar",
    "field works well as a description of many perfectly reasonable matter distributions as discussed by goncalves and moss @xcite .",
    "this serves as an additional motivation for the investigation regarding various aspects of a scalar field distribution .",
    "+ some studies are however , already there in the literature in connection with exact solutions of einstein s equations when a scalar field is coupled to gravity and collapsing modes of such solutions .",
    "christodoulou established the global existence and uniqueness of the solutions of einstein - scalar field equations @xcite . a sufficient condition for the formation of a trapped surface in the evolution of a given initial data set",
    "was also studied by the same author @xcite .",
    "goldwirth and piran showed that a scalar field collapse leads to a singularity which is cut - off from the exterior observer by an event horizon @xcite .",
    "scalar field collapse have been analytically studied by goswami and joshi @xcite , giambo @xcite quite recently .",
    "various massive scalar field models exist as a possible driver of the recent accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "a few examples of collapse scenario of such type of scalar fields are already in literature @xcite .",
    "+ numerical investigations have also provided useful insights into black hole formation in a scalar field collapse . in their extensive works ,",
    "choptuik , brady , and gundlach @xcite considered the numerical evolution of collapsing profiles characterised by a single parameter @xmath0 and showed that the behaviour of the resulting families of solutions depends on the value of p ; there is a critical evolution with @xmath1 , which signals the transition between complete dispersal and black hole formation . for a comprehensive review of the critical phenomena associated with a scalar field collapse",
    ", we refer to the work of gundlach@xcite .",
    "+ the aim of the present work is to look at the collapse of a massive scalar field along with a fluid distribution which is locally anisotropic and contains a radial heat flux .",
    "the potential is taken to be a power law function of the scalar field or suitable combinations of power - law terms .",
    "power law potentials are quite relevant and well - studied in a cosmological context .",
    "many realistic matter distribution can be modelled with power law potentials .",
    "for instance , a quadratic potential , on the average , mimics a pressureless dust whereas the quartic potential exhibits radiation like behavior @xcite . for a potential with a power less than unity results in an inverse power - law self interaction as in the wave equation ,",
    "the @xmath2 term introduces a term with inverse power of @xmath3 .",
    "inverse power law potentials were extensively used for the construction of tracker fields@xcite .",
    "we study the scalar field evolution equation extensively for some reasonable choices of potentials so that we have examples from both positive and negative self interactions .",
    "+ analytical studies are limited to very special cases due to the nonlinearity of the system of equations .",
    "we start with a conformally flat spacetime . in a very recent work , an exact solution for such a scalar field collapse with a spatial homogeneity",
    "was given @xcite , where it was shown that a massive scalar field collapse without any apriori choice of an equation of state , can indeed lead to the formation of a black hole .",
    "under the assumption that the scalar field evolution equation is integrable , the work extensively utilised the integrability conditions for a general anharmonic oscillator , developed by euler @xcite and utilized by harko , lobo and mak@xcite . for the sake of simplicity , both the conformal factor and the scalar field",
    "were assumed to be spatially homogeneous , making the system effectively a scalar field analogue of the oppenheimer - snyder collapsing model . in the present work ,",
    "the assumption of homogeneity is dropped and also the fluid content has a local anisotropy and also has a radial heat flux .",
    "so the system described in the present work is a lot more general than the one in @xcite .",
    "however , the price paid is that the present work assumes the existence of a homothetic killing vector implying a self - similarity in the spacetime .",
    "+ indeed the assumption of self - similarity imposes a restriction on the metric tensor , but it is not really unphysical and there are lots of examples where self - similarity is indeed observed . in",
    "non - relativistic newtonian fluid dynamics , self - similarity indicates that the physical variables are functions of a dimensioness variable @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are space and time variables and @xmath7 , a function of @xmath6 , has the dimension of length .",
    "existence of self - similarity indicates that the spatial distribution of physical variables remains similar to itself at all time .",
    "such examples can be found in strong explosion and thermal waves .",

    "we write down the relevant equations for a general scalar field model along with a fluid distribution in a conformally flat spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "the third section introduces the self - similarity in the system where we write the relevant equation in terms of a single variable . in the fourth section",
    ", the theorem of integrability of an anharmonic oscillator equation is reviewed in brief .",
    "we investigate the collapse of a scalar field with a power - law potential in detail in section five .",
    "the discussion on a combination of a quadratic and an arbitrary power - law potential is given in section six .",
    "the seventh and the final section includes a summary of the results obtained .",
    "the space - time metric is chosen to have vanishing weyl tensor implying a conformal flatness .",
    "conformally flat space - times are well - studied and utilised in the context of radiating fluid spheres or shear - free radiating stars @xcite .",
    "the metric can be written as + @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the conformal factor and governs the evolution of the sphere .",
    "+ the fluid inside the spherically symmetric body is assumed to be locally anisotropic along with the presence of heat flux . thus the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the radially directed heat flux vector .",
    "@xmath12 is the energy density , @xmath13 the tangential pressure , @xmath14 the radial pressure , @xmath15 the four - velocity of the fluid and @xmath16 is the unit four - vector along the radial direction .",

    "the radial and transverse pressures are different .",
    "anisotropic fluid pressure is quite relevant in the study of compact objects and considerable attention has been given to this in existing literature .",
    "comprehensive review can be found in the work of herrera and santos@xcite and herrera et .",
    "in addition to the obvious relevance of an anisotropic pressure in collapsing bodies or in any compact object , it has also been shown by herrera and leon that on allowing a one - parameter group of conformal motions , a smooth matching of interior and exterior geometry is possible iff there is an pressure anisotropy in the fluid description@xcite .",
    "+ we also include a dissipative process , namely heat conduction in the system . in the evolution of stellar bodies ,",
    "dissipative processes are of utmost importance .",
    "particularly when a collapsing star becomes too compact , the size of the constituent particles can no longer be neglected in comparison with the mean free path , and dissipative processes can indeed play a vital role , in shedding off energy so as to settle down to a stable system . for more relevant details",

    "if the singularity is naked , then there exists a real and positive value of @xmath205 as a solution to the algebraic equation @xmath206    waugh and lake @xcite discussed shell - focussing naked singularities in self - similar spacetimes , considering a general radial homothetic killing trajectory .",
    "the lagrangian can be written in terms of @xmath207 , whose value determines the nature of the trajectory , for instance , if @xmath208 , the trajectory is null , and for @xmath209 the trajectory is space - like . in the null case",
    "the trajectory can be shown to be geodesic @xcite . if @xmath208 has no roots given by @xmath210 then the singularity is not naked . on the other hand",
    "the central shell focusing is at - least locally naked if @xmath211 admits one or more positive roots .",
    "the values of the roots give the tangents of the escaping geodesics near the singularity .",
    "@xcite . + for a conformally flat space - time , the metric is defined as @xmath212 $ ] , so we have @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "so the equation for radial null geodesic simplifies considerably into @xmath216 ( where we have considered only the positive solution as we are looking for a radial outgoing ray ) .",
    "we consider the three cases for which we have found exact collapsing solutions in section @xmath217 .    1 .   * case 1 : @xmath77 * + using the time evolution ( [ exact - sol2 ] ) and the condition that the central shell focusing is at - least locally naked for @xmath211 one finds @xmath218 + for the conformally flat metric , from which it is straight - forward to write @xmath219 . the visibility of the singularity depends on the existence of positive roots to eq .",
    "( [ zz ] ) , therefore on the positivity of @xmath220 .",
    "since @xmath221 , the equation for the null geodesic emerging from the singularity may be written as @xmath222 for all values of @xmath106 , @xmath220 is always greater than zero .",

    "thus one can indeed have a naked singularity for @xmath225 .",
    "the singularity in this case is realised at a finite value of @xmath190 , not at @xmath82 and therefore is not a central singularity .",
    "this kind of singularities are generally expected to be covered by a horizon @xcite .",
    "* case 3 : @xmath172 * + equations ( [ exact - sol4 ] ) and the condition @xmath211 lead to @xmath226 which can never have any finite positive solution for @xmath135 . therefore the central singularity in this particular case , defined at @xmath227 at @xmath82 , is always hidden to an exterior observer .    in a recent work hamid , goswami and",
    "maharaj @xcite showed that a spherically symmetric matter cloud evolving from a regular initial epoch , obeying physically reasonable energy conditions is found to be free of shell crossing singularities .",
    "a corollary of their work is that for a continued gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric perfect fluid obeying the strong energy condition @xmath228 and @xmath229 , the end state of the collapse is necessarily a black hole for a conformally flat spacetime .",
    "this idea was also confirmed very recently in a massive scalar field analogue of the collapsing model in a conformally flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "the present work , however , is quite different , as it deals with matter where the strong energy condition is not guaranteed .",
    "this can perhaps be related to the contribution of the scalar field to the energy momentum tensor and the dissipation part of the stress - energy tensor in the form of a heat flux .",
    "the choices of potential and the initial conditions in the form of the constants of integration can indeed conspire amongst themselves so that the energy conditions are violated which leads to the formation of a naked singularity .",
    "a violation of energy condition by massive scalar fields is quite usual and in fact forms the basis of its use as a dark energy . in the present case , as discussed , we find various possibilities , and a black hole is not at all the sole possibility , i.e. the central singularity may not always be covered , at least for some specific choices of the self - interacting potential , for instance @xmath230 as found out in the present work .      for a general spherically symmetric metric    @xmath231    where @xmath232 are functions of @xmath233 , and a comoving observer",
    "is defined so that the velocity vector is @xmath234 , the shear tensor components can be easily calculated .",
    "the net shear scalar @xmath235 can be found out as    @xmath236    for the conformally flat metric chosen in the present work , @xmath237 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath238 in the present case . in the present case",
    ", the existence of anisotropic pressure and dissipative processes might suggest the existence of shear in the spacetime , but the situation is actually shearfree .",
    "a shearfree motion is quite common in the discussion of gravitational collapse , and it is not unjustified either .",
    "but it should be noted that a shearfree condition , particularly in the presence of anisotropy of the pressure and dissipation , leads to instability .",
    "this result has been discussed in detail by herrera , prisco and ospino@xcite .",
    "in section @xmath217 we studied the scalar field equations for a choice of potential for which @xmath64 exploiting the integrability of the scalar field evolution equation .",
    "this approach , though works only for those cases where the scalar field equation is integrable , is useful to make some general comments regarding the collapsing situation .",
    "however , the domain of the coordinate transformation restricted us not to choose a few values of @xmath92 ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "this excluded any chance of studying cases with a quadratic potential . in this section",
    "we assume a form for the potential such that @xmath241 , i.e. @xmath22 is a combination of two power - law terms , one of them being quadratic in @xmath3 . with this choice , the integrability criterion yields a non - linear second order differential equation for the conformal factor @xmath69 as    @xmath242    it is very difficult to find an exact analytical form of @xmath69 from ( [ evolu2 ] ) and thus any further analytical investigations regarding the collapsing geometry",
