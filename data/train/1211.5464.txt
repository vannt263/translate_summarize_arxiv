    "the study of hypernuclei is intimately related to many fundamental aspects of nuclear and hadron physics  @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy can be at best performed with hyperons , since single hyperons are not pauli blocked in nucleonic matter and can provide particular clean information on single - particle spectroscopy .",
    "the investigation of hypernuclei can provide information also on the still less known hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions .",
    "for the latter the production of double-@xmath1 hypernuclei is important , which is one of the main projects of the panda collaboration  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have studied the formation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 hypernuclei in various reactions  @xcite within a covariant transport model  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the discussion of the production mechanisms of double-@xmath1 hypernuclei at panda .",
    "in particular , we examine possible in - medium dependences of hyperon - nucleon interactions important for the formation of hypernuclei in reactions induced by hadrons and heavy - ions .",
    "the fast non - equilibrium stage of reactions is modelled by the giessen - boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( gibuu ) transport model  @xcite .",
    "the gibuu model is based on the following boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck equation @xmath4 f(x , k^ { * } ) = { \\cal i}_{coll } \\quad .",
    "\\label{rbuu}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ rbuu ] ) describes the dynamical evolution of the one - body phase - space distribution function @xmath5 for the hadrons under the influence of a hadronic mean - field ( l.h.s .",
    "( [ rbuu ] ) ) and binary collisions ( r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ rbuu ] ) ) .",
    "our previous dirac - brueckner studies of @xmath6 and @xmath0 in - medium interactions  @xcite are showing that the real parts of the self - energies are well described in hartree - approximation , at least at low energies .",
    "hence , guided by those results , we obtain a numerically feasible approach by extending the mean - field approximation to dispersive processes with imaginary parts derived by a monte carlo procedure ( see below ) .",
    "the relativistic mean - field enters into gibuu through the kinetic @xmath7-momenta @xmath8 and the effective ( dirac ) masses @xmath9 , with the vector and scalar self - energy components given by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , with the isoscalar , scalar @xmath12 , the isoscalar , vector @xmath13 meson fields and the third isospin - component of the isovector , vector @xmath14 meson field .",
    "the meson - nucleon coupling constants @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and also the additional parameters of the non - linear self - interactions of the @xmath12 meson ( not shown here ) are taken from the widely used nl parametrizations , see  @xcite for details .",
    "the antinucleon - meson coupling constants are rescaled by a phenomenological constant such , to reproduce data in high - energy antiproton - induced reactions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the collision term is treated in a parallel ensemble algorithm incorporating the standard parametrizations for the cross sections of various binary processes  @xcite . for the present calculations we follow the usual scheme of using empirical cross section data .",
    "the approach discussed in the next section will allow us to overcome that limitation in the near future .",
    "gibuu results on fragment formation and on multi - strange @xmath1-hypernuclei at panda have been published in refs .",
    "except of a proper description of fragmentation  @xcite , the theoretical description of the various elementary channels for strangeness production is also important .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows some examples for secondary and primary hyperon production channels , where one realizes the need of more precise measurements of such elementary input .",
    "note that not for all the relevant channels data exist .",
    "in fact , the channel @xmath17 , which is crucial for the formation of double-@xmath1 hypernuclei at panda , completely relies on theoretical estimates  @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows gibuu results for the time evolution of strangeness with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for @xmath18-induced reactions at three @xmath18-energies .",
    "the production of bound @xmath1 particles strongly decreases with @xmath18-energy .",
    "this is due to the enhanced repulsive character of the mean - field at large positive energies , as typical for baryon mean - field self - energies , but also due to the strong decrease of the elementary @xmath17 cross section with rising energy .",
    "these results are compatible with our previous studies  @xcite .",
    "reactions induced by ( anti)baryons and heavy - ions take place not in free space , but inside a dense hadronic environment .",
    "thus , the in - medium dependence of the same elementary channels is indispensable for the production of hypernuclei , apart from the mean - field effects .",
    "first studies on this direction have been already started within the bethe - salpeter formalism for @xmath0 in - medium scattering .",
    "this is done by solving the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation for the r - matrix , given in short - hand notation by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the underlying @xmath0-potential in free space , @xmath21 the propagator for intermediate states and @xmath22 the pauli operator for intermediate states . the integration is performed over intermediate states and @xmath23 denotes the principal value . since we account for the coupling of the various @xmath0 channels of same strangeness @xmath24 and total charge , the ls equation , in fact ,",
    "has a matrix structure .",
    "the free space @xmath25 potential is obtained by rescaling the @xmath6 coupling constants of the bonn potential by fits to the scarce data quoted above and results by the juelich group  @xcite .",
    "the parameters are determined such that one first starts at low energies where @xmath26 coupling does not occur , and obtains the rescaling parameter @xmath27 for the simple case of @xmath28 .",
    "the remaining parameters are determined at higher energies above the kinematical thresholds of the channels @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this results in a reduction of the nn coupling parameters by factors @xmath31 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath32 for @xmath30 .",
    "finally , in - medium effects are incorporated by solving the ls equation with the inclusion of pauli projector @xmath22 .",
    "pauli - blocking is in fact the leading order source of medium effects .",
    "since the self - energies are contributing only from second order on , they have been left out at this moment .",
    "s and of @xmath18 s for central @xmath18-induced reactions on @xmath33cu - target at beam energies as indicated . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the energy dependence of @xmath0 elastic in - medium cross sections at different densities . inside nuclear matter ,",
    "the @xmath0 interaction strength is further reduced , mainly by pauli - blocking of the intermediate nucleon states . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the reduction increases with density , leading at saturation density to a suppression of the cross sections by about @xmath34 .",
    "our results indicate that one must expect important in - medium effects of @xmath0 secondary scattering in reactions induced by heavy - ions ( hyphi experiment  @xcite ) and by antiprotons ( panda experiment  @xcite ) and , therefore , on the production of hypernuclei . for a proper treatment in transport - theoretical calculations these in - medium dependences have to be implemented in transport codes , by parametrizing the density and energy dependence of the in - medium cross sections .",
    "this is feasible and presently in progress .     and",

    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath40 is displayed for the @xmath41 and @xmath42 systems as function of @xmath43 , i.e. , the on - shell momentum is taken at the fermi - momentum of the nucleonic background medium .",
    "close to saturation a strong reduction , especially in the @xmath42-channel , is observed , approaching the strength of the @xmath41-channel .",
    "in summary , the production of hypernuclei in reactions induced by heavy - ions and ( anti)protons opens the opportunity to explore the less known hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions at densities close to saturation and beyond .",
    "first transport - theoretical studies within the gibuu transport model have been already performed . here",
    "the in - medium effects of various channels relevant for the production of hypernuclei have been studied and have been found to be important , in particular , at low energies . since the hypernuclear formation takes place inside a rather highly excited hadronic environment , possible in - medium effects , which emerge at finite baryon density , have to be taken into account in transport simulations of reactions",
