    "it should be noted that , despite the formal similarity , our study is on the dynamics of _ closed _ quantum systems and no environment is involved .    in this paper , we will first adopt a series expansion approach and derive a time - local master equation that describes the ensemble - average dynamics of a general quantum system .",
    "the general formalism is then used to study a representative class of hamiltonians obeying gaussian statistics . finally , we apply the master equation method to some physical examples and find interesting phenomena such as fluctuation - induced decoherence and decoherence - induced disentanglement . throughout ,",

    "@xmath155 ) for a short period of time , let us write the master equation in the energy eigenbasis of the harmonic oscillator ,    @xmath156\\overline{\\rho}_{02}(t)-\\sqrt{2}e^{-2i\\omega_{0}t}\\left[\\mathcal{c}(t)+i\\mathcal{s}(t)\\right]\\overline{\\rho}_{20}(t).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    since @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 are all negligibly small for @xmath160 , we have @xmath161 to the lowest order . in the same manner ,",
    "since the depopulation @xmath162 is perturbatively small , we have @xmath163 to the lowest order on the right - hand side .",
    "thus an approximate differential equation is obtained as @xmath164 . solving this ode",
    ", we find , to lowest order , for @xmath165 using approximation to the same order . ]",
    "@xmath166    which holds for short times and agrees with the analytic result in @xcite .    to investigate the evolution of the system for longer times , we write down the master equation in the same basis and solve it numerically . since the hilbert space is of infinite dimensions ,",
    "it is not possible to write down the complete set of ode s for the matrix elements .",
    "instead , we truncate it to a set of @xmath167 coupled ode s that includes only the matrix elements of the five lowest energy - eigenstates and their coherence .",
    "the numerical solutions of @xmath168 ( i.e. fidelity of the ground state ) are shown in figure 1 for different sets of parameters .",
    "it can be seen that , as @xmath169 ( i.e. the dimensionless heating time ) increases with @xmath170 ( i.e. the dimensionless coherence time of @xmath171 ) fixed , the numerical result gives better approximation to the exact dynamics .",
    "also note that , for larger values of @xmath170 , the ground state population shows temporary revival against its general trend of decrease .",
    "despite the artificial defect caused by the truncation of the set of ode s , it is of more interest to know the validity of the 2nd - order master equation itself in approximating the exact dynamics .",
    "this is done by comparing the size of higher - order terms to that of the 2nd - order term . using the gaussian moment theorem@xcite , it is easy to show that @xmath89=0 $ ] for all odd numbers @xmath172 , so we are interested in the ratios between the even - number - order terms .",
    "assuming @xmath170 is fixed , it can be shown that @xmath97\\propto1/\\tau_{1}^{2}\\omega_{0}$ ] as opposed to @xmath98\\propto1/\\tau_{1}$ ] , so @xmath97/\\mathcal{l}_{2}[\\rho]\\propto1/\\omega_{0}\\tau_{1}$ ] .",
    "the same ratio holds for @xmath173/\\mathcal{l}_{4}[\\rho]$ ] , etc .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath174 is small , the higher - order terms become progressively small , lending legitimacy to the 2nd - order approximation .",
    "this is also consistent with the previous observation from the numerical results .",
    "physically , this can be better understood by switching to the schrdinger picture : the external field @xmath175 is treated as a perturbation to the self - hamiltonian of the system @xmath176 . naturally , as the relative size of the perturbing hamiltonian @xmath177 becomes smaller , a perturbative method such as the 2nd - order master equation gives better approximation to the exact dynamics .",
    "in this paper we have presented the derivation of a master equation for closed systems driven by stochastic hamiltonians from an ensemble - average perspective .",
    "the principal result is given in eqs.([eq : effective h]-[eq : general me ] ) .",
    "the validity of this approach is examined and 2nd - order master equation is found to yield either exact dynamics or good approximations to exact dynamics .    applying the formalism to various physical examples , we find the ensemble - average dynamics usually contains decoherence terms in addition to the unitary evolution .",
    "decoherence plays an important role in the foundational problems of quantum mechanics , as it gives insights in two aspects of the measurement problem , namely the absence of observable superposition and the problem of preferred basis @xcite .",
    "extensive research has been done on how environmental entanglement causes decoherence in open systems . however , as our findings suggest , decoherence could also be attributed to the random fluctuations of physical quantities in closed systems .",
    "if this is true , then the tension between the classicality of our experience and the quantumness of the underlying laws of physics could be reconciled in some degree by the ubiquitous random fluctuations .",
    "further investigation is needed to find out ( a ) to what extent decoherence is actually caused by random fluctuations and ( b ) whether / how we can distinguish it from the usual entanglement - induced decoherence through physical observation .",
