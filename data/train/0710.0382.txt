    "spectral observations in which the broad and narrow components are deconvolved are thus a prerequisite for using the fe k line as a tracer of the geometry of the emitting gas .    at the same time , there is strong evidence from x - ray and uv grating observations for the presence of ionized material in the inner regions of a large fraction of agn ( e.g. , blustin et al .  2005 ; mckernan et al .  2007 ) .",

    "in addition , in the case of a partial covering scenario , it is plausible that the absorber s size could be of the same order as that of the x - ray continuum source .",

    "we have deconvolved the broadband emitting components , and determined that 1 ) the existence of the broad fe line is robust in that it was required in all models for an adequate fit , and 2 ) a partial covering component could not mimic the curvature associated with a relativistic broad line .",

    "however , we also can not exclude a contribution from an origin in the putative molecular torus ; there could potentially be a very narrow line component with fwhm velocity @xmath5 a few hundred km s@xmath7 , but the xis would be unable to separate it from the relatively broader line component .",
    "it is possible that the same material that absorbs the hard x - rays along the line of sight is responsible for producing the narrow fe line .",

    "we conclude that it is possible for the primary absorber to contribute to the observed line @xmath57 , but there is also likely a contribution from some other ( non - continuum absorbing ) material lying out of the line of sight , likely with column densities 10@xmath107 @xmath2 ( e.g. , matt et al .",

    "the 13@xmath3 upper limit to ratio of the compton shoulder/ narrow fe k@xmath4 core intensity was a 90@xmath3 confidence limit only , and does not exclude at high confidence the possibility of compton - thick material out of the line of sight .",
    "an additional possibility is that the material emitting the bulk of the line photons could be responding to a continuum flux that was higher in the past .",
    "for instance , if the putative molecular torus is located @xmath5 a pc or so from the black hole , the torus will yield a line @xmath57 corresponding to the continuum flux averaged over the past few years .",
    "this situation is plausible for ngc 3516 , as the 210 kev flux of ngc 3516 during @xmath519982001 ( markowitz , edelson 2004 ) was a factor of @xmath51.52 times brighter than during 2005 .",
    "we now turn our attention to properties of the compton reflection continuum .",
    "_ suzaku _ has observed other seyferts to display reduced levels of variability in the pin band compared to the 210 kev band , e.g. , in mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( miniutti et al .",
    "this behavior is thought to be caused by the presence of the relatively non - varying compton reflection hump , which dilutes the observed @xmath2610 kev variability of the power - law component .",
    "gravitational light - bending in the region of strong gravity has been invoked to explain the relative constancy of the reflection spectrum ( compton hump and fe k diskline component ) despite large variations in the coronal power - law flux in mcg6 - 30 - 15 , for instance ( miniutti et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the case of ngc 3516 ,",
    "the observed fractional variability amplitudes for the 210 and 1276 kev bands were @xmath108 = 9.2@xmath200.3@xmath3 and @xmath109 @xmath19 4.4@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these measurements allow us to rule out the possibility that the compton hump varies in concert with the power - law , since the variability amplitudes would be consistent in that case .",
    "the primary power - law and compton hump contribute 44@xmath3 and 56@xmath3 , respectively , of the total 1276 kev flux . in the case of a constant compton hump and variable power - law , @xmath109",
    "would then be equal to @xmath108 / 2.25 , or roughly 4.1@xmath3 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the observed upper limit on @xmath109 , suggesting that the reflection component varies less strongly than the primary power - law over the course of the observation . to verify this ,",
    "however , we would need to observe ngc 3516 over a larger x - ray flux range than in the current _ suzaku _ observation to potentially observe any significant variability in the pin band .",
    "finally , we discuss the origin of the material that gives rise to the observed compton reflection hump .",
    "the primary and high - ionization absorbers lack the necessary column density , and are excluded .",
    "we next consider an origin in the same material that yields either the broad or narrow fe lines .",
    "george , fabian ( 1991 ) calculated that @xmath45 = 1 corresponds to an observed fe k@xmath4 line @xmath57 ( relative to a primary continuum with a photon index of 1.9 ) of 140 ev for neutral fe , assuming an inclination angle of 25@xmath15 .",
    "however , george , fabian ( 1991 ) used the elemental abundances of morrison , mccammon ( 1983 ) , where the fe number abundance relative to hydrogen was @xmath110 = 3.3 @xmath0 10@xmath111 .",
    "more recent papers have slightly lower values of @xmath110 , 2.73.0 @xmath0 10@xmath111 ( lodders 2003 ; wilms et al .",
    "the expected equivalent width corresponding to @xmath45 = 1 is thus 115125 ev . in our baseline model",
    ", we found a best - fit value of @xmath45 = 1.7 , which corresponds to an expected line @xmath57 ( relative to the primary continuum ) of 200215 ev , a value in between the observed @xmath57s of the broad line ( 287 ev in the baseline model ) and the narrow line ( 123 ev ) .",
    "it is thus not clear from this measurement alone whether the total compton reflection continuum is associated with the broad line ( disk ) , narrow line ( a distant origin ) , or both .",
    "that is , while is it a possibility that at least some portion of the compton reflection component is associated with the broad fe k component , we can not exclude the possibility that the narrow line contributes as well and that there is reflection off cold , distant material .",
    "for example , in @xmath103.3 , we demonstrated that a model wherein there existed both blurred reflection from an ionized disk plus reflection from cold , distant material , such as the molecular torus , provided a good fit to the data .",
    "in addition , we demonstrated in this section that the observed @xmath57 of the narrow fe k line means we can not rule out a contribution to the narrow fe line , and to the reflection continuum as well , from compton - thick material out of the line of sight .",
    "we have reported on a 150 ksec observation of ngc 3516 obtained with the _ suzaku _ observatory in october 2005 .",
    "the good exposure times after screening were 135 ks for each of the xis cameras and 106 ks for the hxd - pin .",
    "our best - fit broadband model included a primary power - law with photon index @xmath30 = 1.904@xmath200.025 in our baseline model , absorbed by a column of material with @xmath75 = 5.5@xmath200.2 @xmath0 10@xmath1 @xmath2 and with log(@xmath39 ) = 0.3 erg cm s@xmath7 .",
    "we modeled the soft band continuum emission using a power - law component which could represent nuclear emission off optically - thin material , unobscured `` leaked '' nuclear emission , or a blend of both .",
    "the hard x - ray absorber could thus be a partial coverer , with a covering fraction @xmath2696@xmath3 , or it could obscure the x - ray continuum source completely . if this absorber is the same `` heavy '' absorption component reported by turner et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in the 2001 _ xmm - newton _ observations , then between 2001 and 2005 the column density of this absorber decreased by a factor of 4.5 , while the covering fraction increased substantially , leading to an observed 0.52.0 kev flux a factor of 23 lower in 2005 than in 2001 .",
    "subsequently , by the 2006 october _ xmm - newton _ observation , the covering fraction returned to approximately the same level observed in 2001 .",
    "one possibility for the variations in the properties of the obscuring material between the 2001 , 2005 , and 2006 observations could be the presence of discrete clouds or filaments within a few light years of the black hole traversing the line of sight ; the equatorial molecular torus invoked in seyfert unification schemes is likely not directly responsible .",
    "we also modeled a highly - ionized absorber with a column density @xmath75 of 4.0@xmath59 @xmath0 10@xmath1 @xmath2 , ionization parameter log(@xmath39 ) = 3.7@xmath60 erg cm s@xmath7 , assumed to have a covering fraction of unity .",
    "our baseline model also included a dozen narrow k - shell emission lines originating in he - like n , o , ne and mg , h - like c , n , o , ne and mg and three rrc features , consistent with an origin in photo - ionized material .",
    "however , we can not exclude a contribution from collisionally - ionized material , as suggested by the presence of an fe l - shell xvii line near 0.83 kev .",
    "the broad fe k@xmath4 line has been robustly detected : we can distinguish between the curvature in the observed continuum due to a partial coverer and that due to a broad diskline ; we conclude that for this observation of ngc 3516 , a diskline component is required and that neither a cold nor ionized partial coverer can mimic the continuum curvature associated with the diskline component .",
    "the broad and narrow lines are decoupled ( detected independently ) at high significance , thanks to the narrow response of the xis and the subsequent high signal / noise ratio in the narrow line . in our best - fit model",
    ", we find the compton reflection strength to be the value of @xmath45 = 1.7@xmath63 .",
    "the narrow fe k@xmath4 line , meanwhile , has a fwhm velocity width of @xmath194900 km s@xmath7 ( 99@xmath3 confidence level for two interesting parameters ) , consistent with an origin in material with the same velocity as ngc 3516 s blr , though a contribution from material with lower velocity widths can not be excluded .",
    "it is possible that the primary hard x - ray absorber may also be responsible for emitting the narrow fe k@xmath4 line , though there may be a contribution from material lying out of the line of sight , such the putative molecular torus .",
