    "we consider random fields on the lattice  @xmath1 in dimensions @xmath6 , with a finite state space @xmath7 per site for some @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the configuration space for the models studied here is @xmath9 .",

    "the results in this paper hold under different further conditions on the measure  @xmath10 , which we will define and discuss first . to do so , for any configuration @xmath11 and any @xmath12 ,",
    "we will write @xmath13 for the configuration restricted to the set  @xmath14 , that is , @xmath13 is considered to be an element of @xmath15 .",

    "the markov property implies the following `` boundary-@xmath23 markov property '' for every state @xmath17 , which will actually be sufficient for our purposes :    for a finite @xmath24 , write @xmath25 for the set of neighbours of  @xmath14 .",

    "boundary-@xmath23 markov property _ if for every finite @xmath24 , given that all sites of  @xmath26 are in the state @xmath17 , the configuration on  @xmath14 is conditionally independent of the configuration on @xmath27 .",
    "a special case of the boundary-@xmath23 markov property is the so - called _ empty - boundary markov property _ as defined in  @xcite , which is the boundary-@xmath28 markov property in our terminology .",
    "note that in the discussion so far , we have considered markovian properties under nearest - neighbour dependencies only .",
    "indeed , in the conditional probabilities   we only consider nearest neighbours of  @xmath22 , and in our formulation of the boundary-@xmath23 markov property , it suffices that the nearest neighbours of  @xmath14 are in the state  @xmath23 to have independence between  @xmath14 and the outside world .",
    "it is not difficult , however , to extend the methods in this paper to random fields with more general dependencies between sites , as long as these dependencies have finite range .    as a typical example of the kind of random fields we want to study , we consider site percolation . in this case ,",
    "@xmath29 and for given @xmath30 , we take the measure  @xmath10 to be the bernoulli product measure @xmath31 such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 for each @xmath19 . since the states of different sites are independent in this case , it is clear that   holds with @xmath34 , and the field is obviously markovian as well . for a given percolation configuration @xmath35 , we say that a site @xmath19 is _ occupied _ if @xmath36 and _ vacant _ if @xmath37 . for convenience",
    ", the same terminology will be used for the states @xmath28 and  @xmath38 of any random field .",
    "this does not attach any special meaning to the states @xmath28 and  @xmath38 , since one can always study the random fields obtained by permuting the states of  @xmath39 .",
    "using the terminology introduced above , we write @xmath40 for the occupied cluster of the site @xmath41 .",
    "that is , @xmath42 is the set of occupied sites ( i.e. , sites in state  @xmath38 ) that can be connected to  @xmath22 by a nearest - neighbour path passing only through occupied sites . by convention , we set @xmath43 if @xmath44 and we write @xmath45 for the cluster of the origin . in general , if @xmath46 , then the number of sites in  @xmath47 is denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , the number of sites in the occupied cluster of the origin will be denoted by  @xmath49 .",

    "that is , is expected to be true quite generally for random fields in the non - percolating regime , i.e. , when all clusters are finite .",

    "see figure  [ fig : patternonc ] for an illustration .",
    "the reason for defining occurrences of patterns on  @xmath92 in this way , is to guarantee that a pattern will always contribute the same number of sites to  @xmath92 whenever it occurs on  @xmath92 .",
    "this fact is crucial for the two - pattern theorems stated below .",
    "however , the standard pattern theorem ( theorem  [ thm : pattern ] below ) still holds if we weaken our definition of an occurrence on  @xmath92 , for instance if we say that a pattern  @xmath82 occurs at  @xmath22 on  @xmath92 if @xmath82 occurs at  @xmath22 and @xmath94 .",
    "this is obvious , because there must be more occurrences of  @xmath82 on  @xmath92 under the weaker definition .",
    "the standard pattern theorem states that for a given pattern  @xmath82 , if the cluster of the origin has size  @xmath0 , then , for some @xmath2 sufficiently small , it is very unlikely that  @xmath82 occurs less than  @xmath3 times on this cluster .",
    "this statement is true whether or not one allows occurrences of patterns to overlap .",

    "we will avoid this by imposing a condition on which occurrences of a pattern are counted .",

    "first of all , we note that there are patterns @xmath82 and  @xmath95 for which overlaps are ruled out by definition .",

    "this section is devoted to the proof of the pattern theorem , theorem  [ thm : pattern ] .",
    "our proof is similar to the proof in  @xcite of a pattern theorem stated in a different context .",

    "however , introducing occurrences of  @xmath82 will change the probability , and it is furthermore clear that many of the generated configurations will be obtained multiple times from different starting configurations .",
    "still , if the random field has the finite - energy property and @xmath206 is small enough , we will generate so many distinct configurations that this contribution wins , and this will prove theorem  [ thm : pattern ] . now let us fill in the details of the proof .",
    "we want to study the probability that the cluster of the origin has size  @xmath0 , and @xmath82 occurs on  @xmath92 at no more than  @xmath3 distinct sites of  @xmath14 .",

    "now , for every @xmath209 , consider all possible ways of creating occurrences of  @xmath82 at exactly @xmath202 sites chosen from the collection  @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is a small number that will be fixed later on .",

    "in general , the same configuration @xmath222 can be obtained from multiple configurations in  @xmath223 .",
