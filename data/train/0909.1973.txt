    "perhaps the simplest model of noise in a quantum system is that of the isotropic depolarizing channel @xmath2 where with probability probability a quantum state @xmath3 is left untouched while with probability @xmath4 it is mapped to the completely mixed state @xmath5 @xmath6 this channel results in the bloch `` ball '' being compressed isotropically by a factor of .",
    "one can imagine a slightly more complicated noise model whereby the noise compresses the bloch `` ball '' anisotropically along axes which are defined by the basis we choose to work in and it is this setting which we investigate below .",
    "the amounts by which we compress along each axis are called the * compression coefficients * and these form the components of the * compression vector*. we investigate the geometric properties of the set of all compression vectors and in particular we ask `` when does this set form a simplex ? ''    these * generalized depolarizing channels * ( also called * anisotropic depolarizing channels * ) form a broad class of channels which can be realized experimentally ( see for example @xcite ) ; in the single qubit case they include the bit - flip and phase - flip channels .",
    "it is worth noting that _ any _ quantum channel ( including the use of a spin chain as a quantum channel @xcite ) can be turned into a generalized depolarizing channel as follows : alice sends one half of a maximally entangled bipartite state down the channel to bob ; the resulting shared state is a mixed bipartite state which is ( excepting very special cases ) not maximally entangled ; alice and bob can now use this shared resource to attempt teleportation @xcite of an unknown @xmath0-dimensional quantum state @xmath3 ; the teleportation protocol then acts as a generalized depolarizing channel on this state @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows : section  [ sec : problem ] gives some precise definitions and describes in detail the problem we solve .",
    "sections  [ sec : p - basis ] , [ sec : gm - basis ] and [ sec : hw - basis ] present the solution to this problem in the pauli , gell - mann and heisenberg - weyl bases respectively ( we prove the conjecture by dixit and sudarshan in section  [ sec : p - basis ] ) whilst section  [ sec : other - bases ] gives the general solution in an arbitrary basis .",
    "we then discuss changing basis in section [ sec : change - basis ] before showing how to adopt our method of solution to deal with more general channels in section  [ sec : more - channels ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "throughout this work we let be a basis for matrices which satisfies the following conditions :    1 .   @xmath7 2 .",
    "@xmath8 for all @xmath9 3 .",
    "@xmath10 for all @xmath11    abusing terminology slightly ( note that ) , we call such a basis * trace - free * and * trace - orthogonal*. we need not restrict ourselves to trace - orthonormal bases as we can simply divide by @xmath12 when necessary to normalize the basis .",
    "if @xmath3 is the density matrix of any @xmath0-dimensional quantum system , then we may write @xmath13 where we have chosen the normalization such that    * if and only if @xmath3 is a pure state * if and only if @xmath3 is a mixed state    where the norm of @xmath14 is defined as .",
    "for notational convenience we add an extra @xmath15 component , , which does not affect the value of @xmath16 .",
    "we call the * polarization vector * and @xmath17 the * polarization coefficients * of the state @xmath3 * with respect to the basis @xmath18*.    the * bloch `` ball '' * is the set of all polarization vectors corresponding to quantum states .",
    "it is important to note that  except for the single qubit case  the bloch `` ball '' is not the ball of unit radius , but rather a convex subset of this ball ( this is because for some vectors lying within the unit ball are not valid polarization vectors as they do not correspond to positive states ) .",

    "it is natural therefore to ask the question `` which vectors @xmath30 are valid compression vectors corresponding to depolarizing channels @xmath19 ? '' from the definition of a depolarizing channel given above it is clear that the answer to this question is `` a vector @xmath30 is a valid compression vector when the induced map @xmath19 is completely positive and ( @xmath19 is trace - preserving ) '' .",
    "it is clear from above that all compression vectors @xmath30 which induce depolarizing channels @xmath19 lie within the finite region .",
    "however we will see that in general the converse is not true : not all vectors in @xmath31 induce depolarizing channels .    to help us",

    "since there are different eigenvectors we have found all the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath34 .    we have therefore shown which vectors @xmath30 induce depolarizing channels @xmath19  namely those for which all eigenvalues of the choi - jamiolkowski representation of @xmath19 are non - negative : for all @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "[ thm : dix - sud ] when and we work in the pauli basis , the set of all compression vectors forms a simplex in compression space .",

    "to finish the proof note that there are @xmath78 vertices of the simplex and there are @xmath78 channels of the form @xmath62 so we have found all the extremal channels .",
    "it is worth pointing out that any compression vector in the simplex can be written as a convex linear combination of the * extremal compression vectors * ( that is , the compression vectors which form the vertices of the simplex ) .",
    "this implies that any depolarizing channel can be written as a convex linear combination of the extremal channels @xmath79 conversely , any channel of this form is a depolarizing channel .",
    "note the following relationship @xmath80    for a single qubit ( ) the compression space has dimension 3 and we see that for a general channel @xmath19 @xmath81 and so we have the following correspondence between extremal channels and compression vectors ( we suppress the @xmath15 component of @xmath82 which is always equal to @xmath56 ) @xmath83 the geometry of these single qubit depolarizing channels is illustrated in figure  [ fig : qubit - tetrahedron ]",
    "in the previous section we restricted the dimension of the quantum system to be so that we could employ the pauli basis for multiple qubits . in this section",
    "we choose one possible generalization of the pauli basis , namely the gell - mann basis , which allows us to study systems with arbitrary dimension .",

    "carefully we see that the only non - zero entries in the two columns indexed by @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( with ) are in the two rows indexed by @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we may conjugate @xmath86 by a permutation matrix @xmath97 ( to permute the rows and columns ) to form a matrix @xmath98 which has identical eigenvalues to @xmath86 . by repeatedly conjugating by permutation matrices we can block - diagonalize @xmath86 to obtain a matrix @xmath99 which has the following structure @xmath100      & & & \\\\    & \\ddots           & & \\\\    & & [ 2 \\times 2 ]     & \\\\    & & & [ k(\\phi_{\\textbf{\\textit{v } } } ) ] \\\\",

    "one way is trivial : if @xmath108 then @xmath109 .",
    "we prove the converse by contradiction : assume that for all , recall that and note that for any @xmath110 ( this is essentially an inclusion - exclusion argument ) .",
    "but then we may split this sum up into two terms @xmath111 it is clear that these sums over @xmath103 odd and @xmath103 even are both non - negative since each @xmath106 is non - negative and @xmath91 appears to an even power in each term .",
    "but then implies that also , which contradicts the assumption that , and so .",
    "since this argument holds for all we are done .    returning to @xmath86 we see from equation ( [ eqn : j(phi ) ] ) that each matrix element consists of a linear combination of the compression coefficients @xmath21  a property which is inherited by @xmath104 .",
    "careful consideration reveals that @xmath106 is a @xmath112-order polynomial in the compression coefficients @xmath113 it is tempting to conclude that is a @xmath112-order surface in compression space .",
    "however we must be careful : it is possible that all @xmath112-order coefficients @xmath114 ( i.e. those with for all @xmath103 ) are equal to zero , in which case the degree of the surface is strictly less than @xmath47 .",
    "for example , when the gell - mann basis reduces to the pauli basis and we have already seen in the previous section that all eigenvalues are linear in the compression coefficients ; in this case the surface is a plane and not a quadratic surface . in general",
    "then , we may only conclude that is a surface of order at most @xmath47 .",
    "we have now proved that the set of all vectors @xmath30 which induce depolarizing channels @xmath19 ( with respect to the gell - mann basis ) form a finite region in compression space which is bounded by    * hyperplanes ( are given by and the remaining one is given by ) * a surface with order at most @xmath115 ( ) *   * a surface with order at most @xmath0 ( )    note that the above does not tell us whether the eigenvalues are linear in the compression coefficients .",
    "it turns out that when at least one of the @xmath91 must be non - linear in the compression coefficients  a fact which is proved in lemma  [ lem : gm - curves ] in section  [ sec : other - bases ] .    whilst it is a slight disappointment that we have been unable to explicitly give expressions for all the eigenvalues of @xmath86 we can draw some solace from the fact that we have simplified the problem somewhat : in order to see if a vector @xmath30 induces a depolarizing channel we must check to see if all the eigenvalues of the choi - jamiolkowski representation @xmath86 of the induced map @xmath19 are non - negative . without the above results we would have to use a `` brute - force '' algorithm to calculate the @xmath78 eigenvalues of @xmath86 directly ; however the above results enable us to calculate of these quickly , leaving only @xmath0 to be calculated by the brute - force algorithm , which is a substantial speed - up .",
    "in this section we work in the heisenberg - weyl basis which is an alternative generalization of the single - qubit pauli basis to arbitrary dimension .",
    "it has certain advantages over the gell - mann basis ( for example , all the heisenberg - weyl basis matrices are invertible while most of the gell - mann basis matrices are singular ) .",
    "however there is a price to pay for such convenience which is that the heisenberg - weyl basis is not hermitian and so the compression space is a complex vector space .",
    "let us first define @xmath116 where is the primitive @xmath117-root of unity and we work modulo @xmath0 .",
    "note that for @xmath118 and that the inverse of @xmath119 is @xmath120 and similarly for @xmath121 .",
    "we now define the * heisenberg - weyl * basis to be @xmath122 note that this basis is trace - free and trace - orthogonal .",
    "we can now find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath86 by defining @xmath123 then it is a simple matter to check that @xmath124 which shows us that @xmath125 are eigenvectors of @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , there are @xmath78 distinct @xmath125 and we have therefore found all the eigenvectors of @xmath86 . relabeling the compression coefficients @xmath21 as @xmath126 ( with ) we see that the eigenvalues of @xmath86 are @xmath127    it is easy to check that and also . therefore , by the observation in the introduction , .    in the preceding sections we have had one ( real ) compression coefficient for each basis matrix . in this section",
    "we have seen that most of the compression coefficients come in complex - conjugate pairs corresponding to two basis matrices which are , up to a complex multiplicative factor , hermitian conjugates of each other .",
    "note that we still have the same number of free compression parameters ( since for each pair of conjugate basis matrices there are two free parameters in the associated compression coefficient , namely the real and imaginary parts ) ; and so the compression space ( although now complex ) still has dimension ( recall that we suppress the dimension corresponding to @xmath22 as it is identically equal to @xmath56 ) .",
    "as an aside , we find the exact structure of the compression space .",
    "we use to see that precisely when and .",
    "when @xmath0 is odd the only solution is and ( i.e. ) . in this case compression space consists complex planes .    when @xmath0 is even there are four solutions , namely . in this case ,",
    "compression space consists of @xmath128 real axes and complex planes .",

    "one can explicitly calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath3 ; they are each with multiplicity two , so @xmath3 is a state when .    let us now apply any change of basis which maps ( that is , we change basis from the hermitian pauli basis to the hermitian gell - mann basis with a unitary change - of - basis matrix @xmath156 ) .",
    "then @xmath164 which has eigenvalues ( with multiplicity 3 ) and ( with multiplicity 1 ) .",
    "but then if then @xmath3 is a quantum state but @xmath165 is not ( as it is not positive ) .",
    "this example demonstrates that some changes of basis do not map the bloch `` ball '' on to itself .",
    "it is for this reason that the set of all compression vectors forms a simplex in some bases but not in others .    when two trace - free , trace - orthogonal bases and are related via @xmath166 for all @xmath23 and some unitary matrix @xmath161 _ ( that is , the change - of - basis matrix @xmath156 maps the bloch `` ball '' on to itself ) _ ,",
    "then the set of compression vectors either forms a simplex in both bases or does not form a simplex in either basis .    furthermore , if the extremal channels are conjugations of basis matrices in one basis then they are conjugations of basis matrices in the other basis too .",
    "one may adapt the proof of theorem [ thm : qubit - simplices ] .",
    "( note that the condition for all @xmath23 guarantees that the `` bloch ball '' is rotated onto itself and we avoid the problems exhibited in example [ ex : bloch - rotation ] . )",
    "throughout the previous sections of this work we have studied depolarizing channels .",
    "our method can be extended to deal with a more general class of channels , namely those which both compress the bloch `` ball '' and then translate it .",
    "let @xmath167 be such a channel defined by its action on the polarization vector @xmath168 we call the vector the * translation vector * and the @xmath169 the * translation coefficients*. note that to ensure that @xmath167 is trace - preserving .",
    "so far we have only studied channels , but we now extend to general @xmath170",
    ". we may expand @xmath171    if we now define @xmath172 for all @xmath23 ; and @xmath173 for and then @xmath174 recalling the fact that if a channel @xmath175 has the expression then the choi - jamiolkowski representation is we see that @xmath176 which enables us to find the choi - jamiolkowski representation of the channel @xmath167 @xmath177    in order to find which parameters @xmath178 induce completely positive channels one has to find for which parameters all the eigenvalues of @xmath179 are non - negative .",
    "( recall that these channels are automatically trace - preserving if and ) .",
    "let us work in the pauli basis and consider a single - qubit channel @xmath167 .",
    "we fix the translation vector and find the set of all compression vectors @xmath30 .",
    "now , @xmath180 it turns out that  for non - zero @xmath181  the eigenvectors of @xmath179 are no longer bell - states , but rather linear combinations of them .",
    "let @xmath182 where are real numbers , and @xmath183 ( ) are the bell - states defined in section [ sec : p - basis ] .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath184 where the eigenvalues satisfy the following relations @xmath185 which can be solved to give @xmath186 note that there are two possible values for @xmath187 and @xmath188 : one for and one for ; we have therefore found all four eigenvalues of @xmath179 . clearly for the surfaces and are curved .",
    "this reproduces the results of @xcite , which also shows that the set of all compression vectors forms an `` asymmetrically rounded tetrahedron '' .",
    "we could have worked through the above example with @xmath189 or @xmath190 non - zero but then the generic form of the eigenvectors of @xmath179 would be more complicated : with the coefficients satisfying .",
    "based on the above example we note that even when we work in a basis where the set of all compression vectors forms a simplex for , a tiny perturbation to destroys this simplex : the set of compression vectors @xmath30 forms a set with a curved boundary ; in this situation there are infinitely many extremal channels .",
    "in summary , we defined _ trace - free , trace - orthogonal bases _ for quantum states and used these to define _ depolarizing channels_. each depolarizing channel has an associated _ compression vector _ which lies in _ compression space _  which is an dimensional vector space ( we suppressed the other dimension as the first component of the compression vector is always equal to unity ) .",
    "we showed that the set of all compression vectors forms a simplex when we work in either the _ pauli basis _ or the _ heisenberg - weyl basis _ , but that it does not form a simplex when we work in the _ gell - mann _ basis .",
    "furthermore , in the pauli and heisenberg - weyl bases we found the extremal channels whose compression vectors lie at the vertices of the corresponding simplex .    working in a general trace - free , trace - orthogonal basis",
    ", we showed precisely for which bases the set of compression vectors forms a simplex .",
    "when the basis matrices were all unitary we were able to find the extremal channels .",
    "we discussed the effects of changing basis and this indicated why the set of compression vectors forms a simplex in some bases but not in others .",
    "finally we generalized our methods to deal with a class of more general quantum channels .",
    "i would now like to recall a theorem proved in @xcite but first i must define a * doubly stochastic * quantum channel acting on an @xmath0-dimensional quantum system to be any completely - positive , trace - preserving channel which leaves the completely mixed state untouched : .",
    "let us now define @xmath191 to be the set of all doubly stochastic channels which act on an @xmath0-dimensional quantum system .",
    "as @xmath191 is a convex set we may define @xmath192 to be the set of extremal channels in @xmath191 .      it is known that all doubly stochastic single - qubit channels are mixed unitary , but that in higher dimensions ( ) there are doubly stochastic channels which are not mixed unitary .",
    "( they can however be expressed as an affine sum of unitary channels where are affine parameters : and . )    in particular , when and we work in any unitary basis for which the set of compression vectors forms a simplex , there exist doubly stochastic channels which do not lie within the simplex and are therefore not depolarizing channels .",
    "however , the following theorem ( proved in @xcite ) tells us that all such channels when appropriately averaged with the isotropic completely depolarizing channel @xmath194 , become mixed unitary .",
    "let @xmath175 be any doubly - stochastic quantum channel acting on @xmath0-dimensional quantum systems and let @xmath33 be any depolarizing channel whose compression vector lies within a simplex whose vertices are the compression vectors of unitary conjugation depolarizing channels .",
    "then there exists a constant such that for the following channel is mixed unitary @xmath197"
