    "the last few years witnessed two important milestones in the realm of relativistic heavy - ion collisions and related applied qcd : ( i ) hints for a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma have been deduced from experiments at rhic  @xcite , and ( ii ) lattice qcd calculations have been extended to non - zero net baryon density . while for many observables , at mid - rapidity , baryon - density effects are fairly small in heavy - ion collisions at top rhic and future lhc energies , they become important for the ongoing low - energy runs at rhic , previous cern - sps and future fair energies .",
    "furthermore , the debated qcd critical point seems to be located at non - zero net baryon density according to investigations reported in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the exploration of this part of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter gains increasing attention , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "a necessary prerequisite in the search of the critical point is the understanding of thermodynamic bulk properties of qcd matter at non - zero net baryon density .",
    "first - principle lattice qcd calculations include all features of the complexity of qcd at finite temperature and net baryon density , supposed the numerical accuracy is appropriate .",
    "indeed , signals of the qcd critical point have been found  @xcite , and the pseudo - critical curve not too far from the temperature axis in the @xmath0 plane is routineously determined today  @xcite ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote temperature and chemical potential , respectively ) .    basically , the partition function @xmath3 or the grand canonical potential @xmath4 or the pressure",
    "@xmath5 contain much information on thermodynamic bulk properties of a medium .",
    "susceptibilities are second - order derivatives of the pressure in the chemical potential direction . in",
    "so far , susceptibilities represent sensible quantities probing the active baryonic degrees of freedom in a medium .",
    "even more , susceptibilities are related to fluctuations , which are debated to represent signatures of deconfinement effects  @xcite , thus being of utmost experimental relevance .    information on various susceptibilities have been accumulated from first - principle lattice qcd calculations  @xcite . keeping in mind possible limitations due to finite - size , numerical set - up and quark mass ( @xmath6 ) effects they , nevertheless , are a source of important information on baryon density effects in the hot quark - gluon medium .",
    "below @xmath7 , where @xmath7 denotes the pseudo - critical temperature for deconfinement , the hadron resonance gas model ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) has been successfully compared with the lattice qcd data  @xcite . above @xmath7 ,",
    "the situation is less settled .",
    "certain baryonic bound states have been considered in  @xcite aiming at arriving at a physical picture of the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma .",
    "further developments  @xcite try to deduce also transport properties of deconfined strongly interacting matter .",
    "in addition , susceptibilities have been studied in phenomenological approaches such as the nambu  jona - lasinio model  @xcite or polyakov loop extensions thereof  @xcite as well as quasiparticle models  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , within the @xmath8 functional approach to qcd  @xcite , qualitative agreement with the lattice qcd data in  @xcite was found for @xmath9 .",
    "all these approaches attempt to catch the relevant excitation modes .",
    "one should keep in mind that in the weak - coupling regime or in a medium with prominent quasiparticle excitations , the bulk properties are governed by excitations with hard momenta @xmath10 .",
    "soft or ultra - hard modes are expected to influence @xmath5 rather less",
    ".    for the ultimate description of the very nature of the quark - gluon plasma one has to know correlations and spectral functions , propagators and related dispersion relations .",
    "such information is still fairly scarce , but starts accumulating  @xcite .",
    "having at our disposal only the numerical data of thermodynamic state variables one must try to figure out which physical picture(s ) is ( are ) compatible .",
    "such an endeavor is clearly phenomenological .",
    "besides the motivation of getting an interpretation of the available lattice qcd data , also the applicability of such phenomenological models represents important aspects , say for extrapolations to larger net baryon density , or for interpolations between different regions of the qcd equation of state ( eos )  @xcite , or for comparing different flavor numbers .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to confront in some detail the lattice qcd data from  @xcite for two degenerate quark flavors with our quasiparticle model  @xcite .",
    "this model was used up to now for one independent chemical potential . with the goal of analyzing isovector , electric charge and flavor ( off-)diagonal susceptibilities we are going to generalize the model towards two independent chemical potentials @xmath11 and @xmath12 of up and down quarks , respectively .",
    "in fact , isovector and flavor ( off-)diagonal susceptibilities represent much more sensible tests of a model than the baryon susceptibility alone . furthermore , a detailed knowledge about the dependence of bulk thermodynamic quantities on , at least , two separate quark chemical potentials @xmath11 and @xmath12 is necessary in order to discuss the impact of changes in various flavor sectors on the baryon density dependence of the eos . also , this becomes important when discussing properties of deconfined quark matter such as @xmath13-stability and electric charge neutrality in hypothetical ultra - dense and hot proto - neutron stars . while for one independent chemical potential , say @xmath14 , the model has been successfully compared with various sets of lattice qcd data in  @xcite , the straightforward generalization to a set of chemical potentials @xmath15 is restricted by consistency requirements  @xcite given by maxwell type relations and the stationarity condition of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "we show here , that the taylor expansion coefficients of various susceptibilities are accessible up to a certain order in a consistent formulation , contrasting our model as an alternative to the picture developed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : qpm ] , we extend the previous quasiparticle model @xcite towards including two independent chemical potentials and discuss the consistency conditions for the resulting generalized system of flow equations .",
    "section  [ sec : numerics ] is devoted to the numerical evaluation of various susceptibilities and the comparison with lattice qcd data .",
    "in addition , these results are used for discussing some properties of hot deconfined quark matter by means of a taylor expansion of bulk thermodynamic quantities imposing , for instance , @xmath13-equilibrium and electric charge neutrality .",
    "the summary and discussion can be found in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "appendix a summarizes the entropy density expression and its relation to the primary thermodynamic potential , while explicit representations of coefficients needed for determining the susceptibilities are listed in appendices b , c and d.",
    "we consider the case of two degenerate quark flavors for which the lattice qcd data  @xcite are at our disposal .",
    "we choose the pressure @xmath16 as fundamental quantity in the following with quark flavor chemical potentials @xmath17 or , equivalently , quark and isovector chemical potentials @xmath18 which are related via @xmath19 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",

    "furthermore , in the flavor symmetric case @xmath31 , we find @xmath32 .",
    "these generalized quark number susceptibilities represent a rich test ground .",
    "besides the mentioned physical meaning of susceptibilities as measures for fluctuations , they additionally constitute the taylor coefficients of the excess pressure @xmath33 , expanded simultaneously in powers of @xmath11 and @xmath12 via @xmath34 thus containing information about baryon density effects in the eos .",
    "( similarly , one could consider the taylor expansion of the pressure @xmath35 in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath23 . ) various associated expansion coefficients , e.  g.  those of flavor diagonal and off - diagonal susceptibilities as well as relations among them , are discussed below .",
    "the excess pressure becomes increasingly important in the domain of larger values of @xmath17 and lower temperatures .",
    "for instance , imposing @xmath13-stability and electric charge neutrality of hot quark matter stars requires the knowledge about the dependence of bulk thermodynamic quantities on @xmath11 and @xmath12 separately , at least .",
    "this underscores the importance of the susceptibilities @xmath37 even if , at small @xmath1 , a taylor expansion in @xmath17 directions may not suffice .",

    "<S> the taylor coefficients of flavor diagonal and off - diagonal susceptibilities as well as baryon number , isovector and electric charge susceptibilities are considered within a phenomenological quasiparticle model of the quark - gluon plasma and successfully compared with available lattice qcd data up to fourth - order for two degenerate quark flavors . </S>",
    "<S> these susceptibility coefficients represent sensible probes of baryon density effects in the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon charge is carried , in our model , by quark - quasiparticle excitations for hard momenta . </S>"
