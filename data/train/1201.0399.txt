    "recent decades have seen the application of mathematical control theory to quantum systems in both physics and chemistry , as technological advances have allowed for greater precision in manipulation of these systems @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "one particular area of interest is the possible construction of quantum computers , which have the power to perform algorithms not accessible to conventional computers .",
    "a major experimental obstacle to any implementation of such a computer , however , is the decoherence of the system under influence of the environment .",
    "while much progress has been made on the control of closed quantum systems @xcite@xcite@xcite , work on open quantum systems has proved more challenging @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "one important issue is that controls are nearly always in the form of hamiltonian operators .",
    "this type of control is unable to directly affect the purity of a state @xcite or transfer the state between unitary orbits . to control purity",
    ", one must use the dissipative dynamics to move between orbits . to this end",
    ", we wish to derive a differential equation that captures only the inter - orbit dynamics , and collects the remaining dynamics ( along the orbits ) into a new control variable .",
    "this can be done if we assume arbitrary control over the hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the resulting differential equation can tell us how the location along the orbit affects the motion between orbits . in this paper , we show that this can be done for two - dimensional systems subject to lindblad dissipation , and the formalism can be extended to consider the problem of purification ( for related work in two dimensions , see @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the preliminaries of lindblad dissipation are outlined in section 2 , and the projection of the lindblad differential equation onto the set of unitary orbits is discussed in section 3 . in section 4 , we analyze the controllability of this equation for various choices of system parameters @xmath0 in particular , the case where the anti - symmetric part of the dissipation is non - zero . in section 5",
    ", we present a theorem that specifies necessary and sufficient conditions for purifiability .",
    "the state of a closed quantum system is described by a norm - one vector in a complex hilbert space that evolves according to the schrdinger equation : @xmath1 in order for the norm to be preserved , the hamiltonian operator @xmath2 must be hermitian .",
    "an open quantum system , on the other hand , is described by a trace - one , positive - semidefinite operator @xmath3 on the hilbert space , known as the density operator ( or density matrix when working in finite dimensions , as we shall ) .",
    "the interpretation of this matrix is the following : an eigenvalue of @xmath3 is the probability that the system is in the corresponding eigenstate . since the matrix is trace - one and positive - semidefinite , these eigenvalues are non - negative real numbers that sum to one .",
    "a state @xmath4 in the closed system becomes a rank - one projection operator @xmath5 and its dual as @xmath6 .",
    "inner products are written @xmath7 and outer products ( or rank - one matrices ) @xmath8 . ] .",
    "the schrdinger equation , when extended to the density matrix , becomes the von neumann equation : @xmath9\\ ] ]    certain relevant quantities are invariant under the von neumann equation .",
    "the density matrix at any time can be written @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is unitary .",
    "since matrices at different times are similar , the eigenvalues are constant .",
    "the purity of the system , which is defined to be @xmath12 , is also invariant since it is the 2-norm of the vector of eigenvalues .",
    "this has implications for quantum control .",
    "since control variables typically appear in the hamiltonian only , the control dynamics can not directly alter the probabilities , or purify the state ( _ i.e. _ achieve a purity of one ) .",
    "however , a system that interacts with the environment will have non - hamiltonian dynamics . in general",
    ", this will be an integro - differential equation , but if one assumes the dynamics depends only the present state and not its history ( _ i.e. _ the markovian condition ) and there is not explicit time dependence , the resulting differential equation is the lindblad equation@xcite@xcite : @xmath13 + \\sum_{j=1}^{m } \\left(l_j\\rho l_j^\\dagger -\\frac{1}{2 } \\{l_j^\\dagger l_j,\\rho\\}\\right ) \\label{lindblad}\\ ] ] the lindblad operators @xmath14 can be taken to be traceless , as adding a multiple of the identity @xmath15 to @xmath16 is equivalent to adding an operator @xmath17 to the hamiltonian .",
    "an alternate equation , known as the lindblad - kossakowski equation , chooses a basis @xmath18 of the set of traceless @xmath19-dimensional matrices that is orthonormal relative to the inner product @xmath20 : @xmath13 + \\sum_{j , k=1}^{n^2 - 1 } a_{jk}\\left(l_j\\rho l_k^\\dagger -\\frac{1}{2 } \\{l_k^\\dagger l_j,\\rho\\}\\right ) \\label{lindkoss}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath21 s form a positive - semidefinite matrix , known as the gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan matrix .",
    "a lindblad operator can be thought as a stochastic jump with recoil . under the influence of one lindblad operator , a pure state @xmath22 in time",
    "@xmath23 becomes a mixture of two states , @xmath24 .",
    "here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , @xmath4 jumps to the state @xmath27 with probability @xmath28 .",
    "this is a jump because the @xmath23 appears in the probability only , meaning the destination state does not approach the original state as @xmath29 .",
    "conversely , the second state in the mixture is @xmath30 , which is infinitesimally close to the original state . in other words ,",
    "depending on @xmath31 , there may be an infinitesimal recoil needed to compensate for the jump process .",
    "when @xmath32 is a multiple of the identity ( for example , when the lindblad operator is a multiple of a pauli matrix ) , the second state reduces to the original state @xmath4 , so that the jump is recoil - less .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , control of open quantum systems typically involves control variables in the hamiltonian .",
    "hamiltonian operators , however , can only move states _ along _ unitary orbits , and not _ between _ orbits .",
    "the goal of this paper is to isolate the between - orbit dynamics for a generic two - dimensional system under lindblad dissipation .",
    "our starting point is the following control system :    @xmath33 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{j , k = x , y , z } a_{jk}\\left(\\sigma_j\\rho \\sigma_k -\\frac{1}{2 } \\{\\sigma_k\\sigma_j,\\rho\\}\\right )   \\label{bigde}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the controls @xmath35 are unbounded and may take any value in @xmath36 .",
    "note that we have chosen our set of control hamiltonians to span @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , we can make any unitary operator up to a non - physical phase difference , and therefore we can move between any two states on a given unitary orbit in arbitrary time .",
    "we are neglecting any drift hamiltonian @xmath38 , since the component along the identity matrix does not contribute to the dynamics , and the components along the pauli matrices can be treated by re - calibrating the control variables : @xmath39 .",
    "the density operator can be written in terms of the pauli matrices : @xmath40 , where the @xmath41 s are components of the bloch vector , such that _ i.e. _ @xmath42 . substituting this expressions into the equation ( [ bigde ] ) ,",
    "we get : @xmath43 + \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{jk } a_{jk}[\\sigma_j , \\sigma_k ] + \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{jkl } a_{jk}n_l ( \\sigma_j\\sigma_l\\sigma_k-\\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_k\\sigma_j,\\sigma_l\\ } ) \\\\      & =   \\sum_{j , k } ( \\frac{-i}{2}u_j n_k+\\frac{1}{4}a_{jk } ) [ \\sigma_j,\\sigma_k ]   + \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{jkl } a_{jk}n_l ( \\sigma_j\\sigma_l\\sigma_k-\\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_k\\sigma_j,\\sigma_l\\ } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pauli matrices obey the relations @xmath44",
    "= 2i\\sum_l \\epsilon_l \\sigma_l\\ ] ] @xmath45 @xmath46 using these relations , the lindblad - kossakowski equation above becomes : @xmath47 if we define @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 in vector notation , we can write : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the matrix with elements @xmath53 .",
    "now we want to decompose this equation into dynamics along and between unitary orbits .",
    "@xmath3 has eigenvalues @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and eigenvectors @xmath56 note the spectra correspond one - to - one with the values of @xmath57 , the bloch radius .",
    "it follows that the unitary orbits are concentric spheres , except for the completely mixed state , which corresponds to the point @xmath58 .",
    "so we can parametrize the orbits by @xmath57 , which lives on the closed interval @xmath59 $ ] , and characterize the motion along orbits with the unit vector @xmath60",
    ". we must be careful with respect to the innermost orbit however .",
    "@xmath61 is not defined there , which means that the differential equations which we will derive for @xmath57 and @xmath61 will have solutions that exist for finite times ( those solutions correspond to trajectories of @xmath3 that pass through the completely mixed state ) .",
    "since @xmath62 , @xmath63 and therefore @xmath64 .",
    "so : @xmath65 the middle term vanishes , the first term is constant in @xmath57 and the third is linear in @xmath57 .",
    "we can write : @xmath66 to find the ode for @xmath61 , we use @xmath67 , which gives @xmath68 .",
    "so we get : @xmath69 our goal here is to view equation ( [ proj ] ) as a control ode where @xmath61 is the control .",
    "this view requires that we have full control over @xmath61 , and we claim that we do , in terms specified by the following lemma .",
    "let @xmath70 be the sphere centered at the origin with radius one , let @xmath71 be the associated closed ball , and let @xmath72 be the closed ball with the origin removed .",
    "let @xmath73 be a piecewise differentiable function from a time interval @xmath74 $ ] onto @xmath70 such that the corresponding solution @xmath75 of equation ( [ proj ] ) is contained in the interval @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "then there are piecewise continuous control functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 such that equation ( [ unproj ] ) has the piecewise differentiable solution @xmath80 on @xmath72 .    first re - write equation ( [ hat ] ) : @xmath81 any equation of the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , has solution @xmath84 .",
    "it follows that we can choose the controls to be : @xmath85 since @xmath73 , @xmath86 and @xmath75 are piecewise continuous , so is @xmath87 .",
    "note that the prescription for @xmath87 is unbounded as @xmath88 because of the middle term .",
    "this is because the system can not approach the completely mixed state from any direction : when @xmath89 , @xmath90 is fixed to be @xmath91 regardless of the controls @xmath87 .",
    "we finish this section by writing down an alternate version of ( [ proj ] ) in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath52 , which allows us to specify a given system in terms of six real parameters .",
    "let @xmath92 be the eigenvalues of @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath93 and @xmath94 be the components of @xmath91 and @xmath95 relative to the intrinsic axes of @xmath52 ( whereas the subscripts @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 denote the components relative to the eigenvectors of the pauli matrices ) .",
    "this gives : @xmath99    the six parameters obey the following inequality , which arises from the positive semi - definiteness of @xmath100 : @xmath101 the positive semi - definiteness of @xmath100 also ensures the positive semi - definiteness of @xmath52 , so we also have @xmath102 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath57 , the right - hand side of equation can be seen as a map from @xmath103 , the set of available controls , to the set of possible values of @xmath104 .",

    "we are interested in @xmath104 when @xmath204 , so insert @xmath213 .",
    "we get : @xmath214 if we insert the identity operator between @xmath215 and @xmath16 in the middle term , we get the expression : @xmath216 for @xmath104 to vanish , we need @xmath217 to vanish for each @xmath16 .",
    "this is only possible however if @xmath218 is an eigenvector of each @xmath16 , since otherwise @xmath219 would have some component in the @xmath220 direction .",
    "this proves the lemma .",
    "this leads to the following theorem :    a two - level lindblad system is purifiable if and only if one of the following characterizations hold :    * there is one lindblad operator , and it is singular .",

    "* there is no more than one singular lindblad operator and any number of non - singular operators .",

    "we are required to show two things to prove a system is purifiable : @xmath221 , and @xmath222 .",
    "the latter ensures that @xmath117 is strictly decreasing rather than constant in @xmath57 .",
    "when combined with the former condition , this implies that @xmath117 is positive for all @xmath224 , and therefore controllable .",
    "it follows from the lemma that a system is purifiable only if all contributing lindblad operators share a common eigenvector , or else @xmath225 will be strictly negative .",

    "this operator is hermitian and traceless , however , so neglecting the trivial zero operator , it is non - singular with orthogonal eigenvectors .",
    "in other words , as long as the system obeys the terms of the lemma , and does not consist of a single hermitian operator , the system is purifiable .",
    "the first two cases in the theorem cover the remaining possible single - operator cases .",
    "the remaining two cases can be seen by noting that two singular operators can not share eigenvectors , since they have only one ( we consider two operators that are multiples of each other to be essentially one process ) .",
    "the third case covers the possibility of one singular operator : it has only one eigenvector , and that eigenvector must be shared with the other non - singular operator .",
    "the fourth case in the theorem covers the possibility of no singular operators but more than one non - singular operator .",
    "note that the non - singular operators in the third and fourth cases need not have non - orthogonal eigenvectors .",
    "we have shown that the inter - orbit dynamics of a controlled quantum system can be isolated from the intra - orbit dynamics by projecting onto the set of spectra of the density matrix .",
    "if one makes certain assumptions about the controllability of the system along the orbits , the position of the system along the orbit can be viewed as a new control variable , since the intra - orbit dynamics can be made arbitrarily faster than the inter - orbit dynamics . in two dimensions ,",
    "we have derived a equation describing this inter - orbit dynamics , where the new control is the normalized bloch vector , and the most general lindblad system can be described by six real parameters : three describing the symmetric part of the dissipation , and three describing the anti - symmetric part .",
    "we have analyzed the controllability of a general two - dimensional system under lindblad dissipation , particularly for dissipation with non - zero anti - symmetric part . for systems of this type ,",
