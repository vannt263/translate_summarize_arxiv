    "entanglement purification protocols @xcite generate bell states from an ensemble of noisy entangled states .",
    "they have found application in many areas of quantum information theory @xcite and prominently in proposed quantum communication technologies @xcite . from a mathematical perspective",
    ", the effect of these protocols can be described as a non - linear map of the parameter defining the input density matrices .",
    "the first of the so - called recurrence protocols @xcite was introduced by bennett and collaborators @xcite .",
    "this protocol relies on werner states @xcite which are described by one parameter and therefore the convergence of the corresponding map @xcite can be studied in a simple way .",
    "a more efficient protocol was introduced by deutsch et al .",
    "@xcite based on bell diagonal states involving a three dimensional parameter space .",
    "the convergence analysis is more intricate in this case and was studied separately in detail by c. macchiavello @xcite .",
    "there are two essential steps in recurrence entanglement purification protocols @xcite , which are reconsidered in this work : first , the application of random local unitary rotations transforming any initial density matrix into a werner @xcite or a bell - diagonal state @xcite .",
    "second , the application of bilateral controlled - not gates on the spatially separated quantum systems . the latter step has already been modified in our proposed purification protocol @xcite based on refs .",
    "the modification was motivated by the design of a multiphoton - assisted quantum repeater and instead of controlled - not gates it is based on a rank two projection in the bell basis which can be implemented in a one - atom maser setup @xcite .",
    "we have studied in ref .",
    "@xcite the performance of the modified protocol using werner and other bell - diagonal states . a natural question arises whether this protocol can still work for arbitrary input states making the step of random local unitary rotations ( `` twirling '' ) superfluous .",
    "this problem holds great significance , because random operations can waste important entanglement and their implementation is not straightforward .",
    "therefore , a solution to this problem could offer a less intricate purification protocol and a better compatibility with certain experimental settings .    in this paper",
    "we show that our protocol , first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , can exploit the entanglement of arbitrary initial states without using random unitary operations .",
    "after one iteration of the protocol , any input state is mapped onto a density matrix described by seven real parameters .",
    "this form is invariant under further iterations of the protocol .",
    "we exploit this feature to analyze the convergence properties for any input state of this form . based on this analysis , we generalize to the case of arbitrary two - qubit states and find conditions that allow purification of bell states .",
    "we demonstrate that in contrast to previous schemes @xcite , a purifiable state does not require an initial fidelity larger than one half with respect to any bell state .",
    "in particular , we find a class of states with overlap less than one half with any maximally entangled pure state that can be purified in just one step of the protocol .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ purifyp ] we reintroduce and explain the steps of our protocol . in sec .",
    "[ purify7 ] we study the set of density matrices characterized by seven real parameters and derive the conditions for a successful entanglement purification . in sec .",
    "[ purify15 ] we extend the analysis to density matrices characterized by fifteen real parameters .",
    "examples which obey the newly found conditions are presented in sec .",
    "[ examples ] . in appendix [ app ]",
    "we present the stability analysis of the fixed points for the seven dimensional parameter space .",
    "in this section we review the entanglement purification protocol introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite which is based on the protocols of refs .",
    "@xcite . let us consider as initial condition the product state of two qubit pairs @xmath0 both pairs are assumed to start in the same state @xmath1 with certain degree of entanglement and their qubit components to be in distant locations labelled by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the aim of an entanglement purification protocol is to trade two pairs for one pair with larger degree of entanglement using only local operations in laboratories @xmath2 and @xmath3 and classical communication between them .",
    "this can be achieved by increasing the fidelity with respect to any of the bell states @xmath4    the purification protocol that we consider in this work consists of the following steps : + ( i ) the two - qubit quantum operation @xmath5 is applied locally in locations @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath6 after a successfully applied quantum operation the four qubit system attains the state @xmath7 ( ii ) one of the pairs is then locally measured in the computational basis , say pair @xmath8 .",
    "the choice of the measured pair is unimportant as the operation is symmetric and the initial qubit pairs are identical .",
    "there are four possible states in which one can find pair @xmath8 : @xmath9 with @xmath10 . a successful measurement of one of the states @xmath11 results in the two qubit state @xmath12 ( iii ) depending on the measurement results , the quantum gate @xmath13 is applied to the remaining qubit pair , where @xmath14 with the pauli operator @xmath15 .",
    "the final two - qubit state is then given by @xmath16 we remark again that there is a free choice of the qubit pair to be measured as our quantum operation @xmath5 is symmetric in contrast to the controlled - not gate used in the seminal protocols @xcite .",
    "as the entangled pairs are assumed to start in the same state @xmath1 , in what follows we will omit the labels and study the two qubit map @xmath17 .",
    "now that we have explained the key elements of the protocol , we will study the resulting map between initial and output states of the qubit pairs . consider a general two - qubit density matrix that can be written as @xmath18 where we have chosen to work in the bell basis labeled in the following way @xmath19 due to the conditions @xmath20 and @xmath21 we have the following relations : @xmath22 the probabilistic part of this protocol takes place in step ( i ) , i.e. , in the application of the bilateral two - qubit quantum operation @xmath5 .",
    "the success probability of the quantum operation is @xmath23 , with @xmath24 provided both implementations of @xmath5 are successful , the steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) can be given for granted as they involve unitary gates and none of the qubit measurements is discarded .",
    "the resulting two - qubit density matrix @xmath25 in the same basis as has the non - zero entries @xmath26 together with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , these are the only non - vanishing elements of @xmath25 after a single iteration of the protocol .",
    "the constant @xmath29 plays here the role of a normalization factor and the resulting density matrix has eight vanishing entries .",
    "therefore , only seven parameters characterize these type of states , in contrast to the fifteen parameters needed to describe a general two - qubit state .",
    "this simplification motivates the study of the purification protocol for density matrices described by the seven primed parameters of eq . .",
    "it is worth to note that the protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite is also able to reduce the fifteen dimensional parameter space to a seven dimensional one .",
    "this happens technically in a rather different way as in our protocol .",
    "after measuring the target pair during the procedure , one keeps the control pair only if the target pair was found in the state @xmath30 .",
    "the result can be obtained by a straightforward application of the protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite on general two - qubit density matrices and up to our knowledge it has never been reported .",
    "in this section we concentrate our study on initial two - qubit states described by seven free parameters , which have been delineated in eq . . in the bell basis",
    "they have the matrix representation @xmath32 and therefore we refer to them them as @xmath31 states .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath33 $ ] and the off - diagonal elements @xmath34 fulfil the conditions @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the four eigenvalues can be represented as the two pairs @xmath38 and @xmath39 which can be obtained from the quadratic formula @xmath40 as the eigenvalues of @xmath1 have to be real non - negative numbers , the radical in eq . has to be positive , and this imposes the following restriction to the absolute value of the coherences @xmath41    in the case of input states in the form of eq .",
    ", the output state @xmath25 remains in the same form and according to with the new coefficients : @xmath42 and the normalization factor @xmath43 in order to find the convergence properties of this map , we will first study the behaviour of the off - diagonal elements after one iteration by considering the norm of the pair @xmath44 .",
    "it turns out that this quantity does not increase , but typically decreases after iteration of the map .",
    "this can be noted by analyzing the ratio @xmath45 where we have used the normalization factor in eq . .",
    "the first inequality can be obtained by direct evaluation of @xmath46 and @xmath47 using eq . , and",
    "by taking into account the triangle inequality @xmath48 . the second inequality in eq .",
    "follows from considering the ratio between the maximum value of @xmath49 and the minimum value of @xmath29 , both of which are @xmath50 . to show this , first note that according to eq .",
    ", @xmath29 attains its minimum value @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "secondly , we take into account the conditions in that combined with the normalization condition for @xmath1 and the fact that for any pair of real numbers @xmath52 , implies the relation @xmath53 between the coherences . taking",
    "the equality case in one can note that the equality in eq . is achieved only with the initial conditions @xmath54 only in these three cases",
    "the norm of the coherences remains constant after repeated iteration of the map in .",
    "for all other values of the coherences , the ratio in eq . is strictly less than one and therefore @xmath55 and @xmath56 tend to zero by repeated iterations of the map .",
    "we remark that in all these three cases , all the diagonal values are less that one half .",
    "now we turn our attention to the diagonal elements .",
    "the aim is to find the initial conditions that after iteration of the map tend to one of the bell states .",
    "the protocol we have presented here is not the same as the protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite , however the map for the diagonal elements @xmath57 has a similar structure .",
    "therefore , we follow the idea of the proof in ref .",
    "@xcite , where bell diagonal density matrices were studied .",
    "the same treatment is justified in our case as the diagonal elements in eq .",
    "do not depend on the off - diagonal ones .",
    "we start this discussion by noting that @xmath58 and @xmath59 which indicates that neither @xmath60 or @xmath61 can reach unit value , actually not even above @xmath50 . with this fact we recognize that only @xmath62 or @xmath63 can potentially increase their value to unity after repeated iterations of the map .",
    "noting the symmetry of the map under interchange of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , allows us to consider only the maximization of one , say @xmath62 . indeed the case @xmath66 and all other parameters equal to zero is a fixed point of the map .",
    "now , let us rewrite the value of @xmath67 as @xmath68 were we have introduced the quadratic form @xmath69 whenever @xmath70 is positive , @xmath67 attains values larger than @xmath50 .",
    "this actually happens whenever @xmath62 or @xmath60 are larger than @xmath50 and in this case the function @xmath71 increases after iteration of the map , as can be noted from the relation @xmath72 ^ 2}\\ge 1 ,    \\label{supercondition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the inequality follows from the fact that @xmath75 for @xmath76 , which holds true if @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "the function @xmath70 increases its value after application of the map when the strict inequality is met . in this case , as @xmath70 is a monotonic function of @xmath62 and @xmath60 , iteration of the map converges to the fixed point with @xmath66 which is the only fixed point with the condition @xmath77 .",
    "the equality in happens only in the case @xmath79 , but after each iteration of the map with initial values @xmath79 , the values of @xmath61 and @xmath63 can not be simultaneously zero and thus @xmath80 unless @xmath81 but that would be the case of the fixed point with @xmath66 .",
    "this proves that the condition to purify to a bell state @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath66 , can be written as @xmath83 in complete analogy due to the symmetry @xmath64 and @xmath65 , one can find the condition to purify to bell state @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath66 , can be written as @xmath85     three dimensional space of the independent diagonal elements @xmath86 .",

    "the black dots are the stable fixed points that correspond to bell states , whereas the red one is the fixed point representing the totally mixed state . ]",
    "these inequalities define four purifiable regions in the three dimensional space of the diagonal parameters shown in fig .",
    "[ space7 ] .",
    "these findings are similar to ref .",

    ", our proof is extended taking into account off - diagonal elements of @xmath31 states subject to our protocol .",
    "we have shown in eqs . and that the absolute value of the off - diagonal parameters decreases in the regions subject to the conditions and .",
    "therefore the regions depicted in blue and green in fig .",
    "[ space7 ] have one stable attractor point . in appendix [ app ]",
    "we evaluate numerically the stability of the fixed points .",
    "in this section we extend our analysis to the case of general two - qubit density matrices in eq . .",
    "in this case and after one iteration one obtains the density matrix of an @xmath31 state ( see eq . ) .",
    "therefore , the most important question is to define the conditions in which after the first iteration of the map one obtains any of the four @xmath90 s larger than @xmath50 .",
    "first we note that one can never achieve @xmath91 or @xmath92 after one iteration .",
    "this due to the fact that @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which is noted from by comparing their numerators and considering that : @xmath93 for any @xmath94 and because @xmath95 for any @xmath96 .",
    "this means that we only have to find those conditions that leave @xmath97 or @xmath98 . for symmetry reasons it suffices to focus in only one , we choose @xmath62 .",

    "this actually means that the purification protocol is able to convert the entanglement of other states into @xmath82 .",

    "this clearly means that there exists states which do not have an overlap with a bell state larger than @xmath50 but their ensemble can be still purified to @xmath82 or @xmath84 . in the subsequent discussion ,",
    "we investigate the inequalities of eqs . and .",

    "in this section we provide examples of states that fulfill the condition in eq . .",
    "the examples show how our protocol is able to purify initial entangled states with low fidelity with respect to bell states .",
    "_ example 1 .",
    "_ consider the parameter @xmath114 $ ] determining the state @xmath115 the state @xmath116 has no fidelity larger than one half with respect to any of the four bell states .",
    "however , it has fidelity @xmath117 with respect to the maximally entangled state @xmath118 .",
    "taking into account that in this example @xmath119 and @xmath120 one can find that after one iteration of the map @xmath121 which is always larger than @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "this is an example of an initial state where the fidelities with respect to any of the four bell states is smaller than one half and still the state @xmath82 can be purified .",
    "of course , here the fidelity with respect to the maximally entangled state @xmath124 is being exploited by the protocol .",
    "in contrast , this feature would be lost with other known protocols @xcite that use random unitary gates to bring a state into a bell diagonal form .",
    "this procedure would destroy the entanglement of @xmath116 .",

    "_ now take the parameter @xmath125 $ ] that parametrizes the state @xmath126 in this example @xmath127 and @xmath128 . after a single iteration of the protocol",
    "one finds that the fidelity with respect to @xmath84 takes the value @xmath129 this means that no matter the value of @xmath130 , as long it is not zero , the state can be purified to @xmath82 in just one iteration of the protocol .",
    "the success probability is @xmath131 and therefore the smaller the value of @xmath130 the less probable is the occurrence of an event that generates @xmath82 .",
    "however , the fact that perfect purification is achieved in just one step makes this protocol with this initial state an attractive candidate .",
    "typically the overall success probability scales exponentially with the number of steps @xcite and the convergence is formally achieved in an asymptotic way .",
    "interestingly , state @xmath132 has overlap smaller than one half with any maximally entangled pure state . in order to proof this statement ,",
    "let us consider the general form of these type of states in the bell basis .",
    "first , we recall that the concurrence @xcite is a measure of entanglement which takes unit value for maximally entangled pure states . for a pure state @xmath133 it is defined as @xmath134 with the pauli matrix @xmath135 and where @xmath136 is the complex conjugated vector of @xmath137 .",
    "the bell states are eigenstates of the operator in eq . , namely @xmath138 and @xmath139 . with this",
    "one can note that , up to a global phase , any maximally entangled pure state has the form @xmath140 with coefficients @xmath141 and satisfying the normalization condition @xmath142 .",
    "then , by introducing @xmath143 , the fidelity of @xmath132 with respect to any maximally entangled pure state takes the form @xmath144 the first inequality takes into account the normalization conditions of @xmath137 .",
    "the last inequality is valid provided both @xmath130 and @xmath145 are positive numbers less than a half , which is true by our choice of @xmath130 and by the definition of @xmath145 .",
    "finally , let us point out that the parameter @xmath130 is actually the concurrence @xcite of the state @xmath132 .",
    "indeed , it is not hard to realize that the matrix @xmath146 has only one eigenvalue given by @xmath147 and therefore , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the concurrence is @xmath130 .",
    "we have studied the convergence of arbitrary input two - qubit states , under the influence of the entanglement purification protocol presented in sec . [ purifyp ] and",
    "first introduced in ref .",

    "we have studied in detail the convergence in a subset of density matrices which is left invariant by the protocol .",
    "this subset is characterized by seven real parameters , three of which are diagonal elements of the density matrix in the bell basis .",

    "we have introduced a quadratic form which decreases under each iteration of the map . combining these results",

    "random unitary rotations are required in those cases to bring any state into a bell diagonal state .",
    "this step in the original protocols may destroy useful entanglement .",
    "the fact that our protocol does not require such step is the reason why we obtain less constrained conditions for purifiable initial states .    exploiting these new findings",
    ", we have shown that our protocol allows purification of entangled states having an overlap less than one half with any bell state .",

    "the states are parametrized by their concurrence @xmath130 and the probability of success is given by @xmath131 .",
    "this feature is interesting , as the resources of entanglement purification scale exponentially with the number of states .",
    "therefore , our result could initiate the study of other type of local two - qubit operations which might lead to an optimal entanglement purification for specific type of states .",
    "provided that the source of the entangled pairs is well under control , the engineering of an efficient local two - qubit operation might be more resourceful than the application of a controlled - not gate .",
    "this work is supported by the bmbf project q.com .",
    "in order to show that there are no other stable fixed points in regions defined by the conditions and , we have numerically investigated the stability of the fixed points of the map .",
    "this is accomplished by studying the jacobian matrix with entries @xmath149 .",
    "the entries can be defined defined with the help of the function @xmath150 as @xmath151 , where each @xmath152 is a component of the eight dimensional vector @xmath153,\\mathrm{im}[r_{14}],\\mathrm{re}[r_{23}],\\mathrm{im}[r_{23}])$ ] .",
