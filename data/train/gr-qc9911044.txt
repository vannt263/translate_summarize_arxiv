    "the test mass suspension of the virgo detector , the superattenuator ( sa ) @xcite , has been designed in order to suppress the seismic noise below the thermal noise level above 4 hz . the expected residual motion of the mirror is @xmath0 m@xmath1 @4 hz . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the residual motion of the mirror is much larger ( @xmath2 mm rms ) , due to the normal modes of the sa ( the resonant frequencies of the system are in the range 0.04 - 2 hz ) .    to lock the virgo interferometer",
    "the rms motion of the suspended mirrors must not exceed @xmath3 m ( to avoid the saturation of the read - out electronics ) .",
    "virgo locking strategy is based on a hierarchical control : feedback forces can be exerted on 3 points of the sa ( inverted pendulum ( ip ) @xcite , _ marionetta _ and mirror ) . the control on the 3 points is operated in different ranges of frequency and amplitude .",
    "the maximum mirror displacement that can be controlled from the marionetta without injecting noise in the detection band is @xmath4 @xmath5 m .",
    "therefore , a damping of the sa normal modes is required for a correct operation of the locking system .",
    "an active control of the sa normal modes , using sensors and actuators on top of the ip , capable of reducing the mirror residual motion within a few microns , has been successfully implemented .",
    "the setup ( fig . [ setup ] ) of the experiment is composed by a full scale superattenuator , provided with 3 accelerometers ( placed on the top of the ip ) , 3 lvdt position sensors ( measuring the relative motion of the ip with respect to an external frame ) , 3 coil - magnet actuators .",
    "the accelerometers work in the range dc-400 hz and have acceleration spectral sensitivity @xmath6 below 3 hz @xcite .",
    "the sensors and actuators are all placed in _ pin - wheel _ configuration .",
    "the sensors and actuators signals are elaborated by a computer controlled adc ( 16 bit)-dsp - dac ( 20 bit ) system .",
    "the dsp allows to handle the signals of all the sensors and actuators , to recombine them by means of matrices , to create complex feedback filters ( like the one of fig .",
    "[ filter ] ) with high precision poles / zeroes placement and to perform a large amount of calculations at high sampling rate ( 10 khz ) .",
    "the suspended mirror is provided with an lvdt to measure its displacement with respect to ground .",
    "the active control of the sa normal modes is defined _ inertial damping _ , because it makes use of inertial sensors ( accelerometers ) to sense the sa motion .",
    "the advantage of using accelerometers is that they perform the measurement with respect to the  fixed stars \" , while position sensors do it with respect to a reference frame which is not seismic noise free .",
    "therefore , inertial sensors are to be used so that no seismic noise is reinjected by the feedback . actually , in the real sa control both sensors are used : position sensors provide a low frequency ( dc - 10 mhz ) control of the sa position ( in order to avoid drifts ) , while accelerometers allow a wideband reduction of the noise in the region of the sa resonances ( 10 mhz - 2 hz ) .     of the sensors",

    "several ways of improving the inertial damping performance have been identified :    * a steeper low pass filtering of the lvdt output above @xmath31 may reduce the amount of reinjected seismic noise . in doing",
    "this one has to be careful to preserve proper phase difference between the lvdt and accelerometer signals ; * the lower @xmath14 the smaller the amount of reinjected noise .",
    "lowering @xmath14 is difficult due to the mechanical tolerance on the parallelism of the ip legs : if the legs are not perfectly parallel , the top table tilts slightly as it translates . therefore , the accelerometer signal is dominated by the tilt below 15 - 20 mhz , making thus impossible to use the accelerometers at very low frequencies .",
    "a technique for subtracting the effect of the tilt ( using the information provided by the displacement sensors ) has been defined and used to obtain the results here described @xcite .",
    "cancelling the tilt effect down to @xmath32 mhz makes us able to use the accelerometers down to 10 mhz @xcite .",
    "stricter requirements on the ip legs machining and improvements in the tilt subtraction technique may allow a lower cross frequency .",
