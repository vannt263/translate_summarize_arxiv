    "many experiments have been dedicated to the study of fluid flows between rotating stainless - steel disks @xcite .",
    "three experimental configurations can be found in the literature : two contra - rotative disks ; the upper disk rotating while the other is at rest ; and the lower disk rotating , the other being at rest . for a given reynolds number , i.e. at a given distance from the center of the plate @xcite , a transition in the boundary layer occurs .",
    "the encountered instabilities are of krmn , ekman or bdewadt types and may lead to one of the following patterns : ( i ) concentric circles at a low rotation speed ( ii ) spirals at a medium rotation speed and ( iii ) a disordered state at large rotation speeds @xcite .    on the other hand , one can note the growing interest of the statistical physics community to the granular state .",
    "particularly , the ripple formation on sand bed eroded by a fluid such as air or water has become a largely studied phenomenon @xcite . despite the familiar aspect of the ripples ,",
    "the physical mechanisms involved in their formation are related to complex phenomena of granular transport such as avalanches , saltation , reptation and suspension @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "both subjects will be combined in a single experiment .",
    "we will study the stability of a granular surface submitted to a circular fluid flow . in the next section , the experimental setup will be described . in section iii",
    ", we will present the results , and discuss them in section iv .",
    "finally , a summary of our findings is given in section v.",
    "our experimental setup is illustrated in fig.[manip ] and consists of a horizontal circular plate connected by a belt to an engine .",
    "the rotation speed can be adjusted from 8 rpm up to 100 rpm .",
    "a cylindrical container ( radius @xmath6 cm ) filled with water and sand ( mean grain diameter @xmath7 m ) is placed in the center of the plate and put into rotation . when the rotation is brutally stopped , the sand bed remains fixed while the water continues its inertial circular motion .",
    "the shear stress applied to the sand by the water flow initiates various grain motions : saltation , reptation and suspension . after a short time",
    "( typically 2s ) , current ripples are formed [ see fig.[manip ] bottom ] .",
    "+ 0.2 cm     a ccd camera is placed on the top of the plate and records an image of the sand bed . in order to avoid shadow effects ,",
    "the container circumference is homogeneously illuminated .",
    "an annular luminescent tube with a radius of 12 cm is placed horizontally around the container , at the level of the sand - water interface .",
    "we assume that the height of sand is given by the intensity of the pixels on the grayscale images , due to this side lightning . within this assumption",
    ", the landscape is given with an accuracy of @xmath8 .",
    "the parameters of our experiment are : ( i ) the height of water @xmath2 over the sand bed before rotation , and ( ii ) the rotation speed @xmath1 of the container .",
    "moreover , one should note that the reynolds number varies on the granular surface as a function of the distance @xmath9 from the center of the container @xcite .",
    "therefore , the reynolds number @xmath10 we will use can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the kinematic viscosity of the water , i.e. @xmath13 m@xmath14 s@xmath15 .",
    "we have performed experiments with values of @xmath1 ranging from 29 rpm to 71 rpm , and values of @xmath2 ranging from 1.05 cm to 3.36 cm . for each experiment ,",
    "an image of the landscape has been taken . on each image , we have extracted transversal profiles of the landscape at 50 different @xmath3 values , i.e. different @xmath10 values .",
    "figure [ instab ] presents typical data for two values of the reynolds number : @xmath16 ( @xmath3=3 cm ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath3=10 cm ) . for small reynolds number values ,",
    "the profile is very noisy and no modulation is observed .",
    "the noise comes from the irregularities of the granular surface . on the contrary",
    ", we have noticed a periodic profile for large values of @xmath10 .",
    "the transition between noisy and periodic regions is well defined and occurs at a given critical radius @xmath0 .",
    "the profiles are periodic above @xmath0 and noisy elsewhere .",
    "this kind of behavior is characteristic of the emergence of an instability in the sand - water interface .",
    "this is similar to what is observed in the case of an instability in the boundary layer of a fluid flowing over a stainless - steel disk @xcite .",
    "+    for all tested values of both parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 , we have noticed the appearance of that instability for high reynolds number values .",
    "however , we have remarked that the pattern formed on the granular landscape depends on the experimental parameters .",
    "indeed , we have recorded three kinds of patterns : ( i ) one spiral ; ( ii ) two superposing spirals , one having the arms close to the tangential direction to the container circumference , the other being more open ; and ( ii ) two paired spirals having the same number of arms and having their arms coupled one to the other .",
    "figures [ phases]a - c illustrate those different patterns .",
    "rpm ) the ripples form one spiral . ( b ) at medium speeds ( @xmath18 rpm ) two spirals are superposed , one having arm azimuthal angles larger than the other ones . ( c ) at high rotation speeds ( @xmath19 rpm ) the arms of the two spirals are coupled.,width=321 ]    we have constructed a phase diagram giving the pattern as a function of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters .",
    "one should note [ see figure [ diag_phase ] ] how the pattern depends on the rotation speed @xmath1 and is less dependent on the height of water @xmath2 .",
    "looking for details in images corresponding to the phase diagram , we have concluded that the patterns evolve as follows . at a low rotation speed ( @xmath20 rpm ) , spirals are created above a critical radius @xmath0 .",
    "an increase of @xmath1 causes the increase of the spiral arm angles , as we will see further . at medium rotation speeds ( @xmath18 rpm )",
    "a second spiral appears .",
    "the arms of this second spiral are nearly tangential to the cylinder circumference . as a consequence ,",
    "one observes two superposed spirals .",
    "if the rotation speed is increased again ( @xmath19 rpm ) , the second spiral becomes more and more open , so that both spirals are paired .          in order to determine the geometrical properties of the patterns",
    ", we have decomposed the data of the different profiles within fourier series , according to the equation @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the height of sand at position @xmath23 along the circle of radius @xmath3 , @xmath24 is the fourier mode , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the fourier coefficients .",
    "the sum is extended over @xmath27 terms , where @xmath27 is equals to the number of points in the discretization of @xmath22 .",
    "typically , @xmath28 .",
    "one should note that the geometry of our experimental setup allows us to use fourier approximation without restriction . from this approximation",
    ", we can compute the statistical weight @xmath29 of a given mode @xmath24 in the series by @xmath30 the knowledge of all weights @xmath29 allows us to determine the mean amplitude @xmath31 of the ripples @xmath32 the mean wavelength of the patterns at the radius @xmath3 is then given by @xmath33 which is the circumference at the considered radius @xmath3 , divided by the statistical mean of the weighted modes @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to note that practically , the sums are calculated from @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 .",
    "in such a way , we remove the large modulations of the surface .",
    "those large oscillations are artifacts due to the preparation of the sand bed before the experiment is started .",
    "such problem is also encountered in other experiments dealing with granular surfaces @xcite .      with the help of fourier decompositions",
    ", one can easily find the value of @xmath0 .",
    "for all radii @xmath36 , the profiles are noisy .",
    "in such a noise , all frequencies have the same probability of being found in the profiles ( white noise ) .",
    "mathematically , this fact results in fourier series which are sums of @xmath37 and @xmath38 with nearly the same statistical weights @xmath29 . on the contrary , for @xmath39",
    "the periodic shape of the profiles implies the existence of a characteristic mode @xmath40 in each profile .",
    "the value of @xmath40 is equals to the number of ripples in the profile .",
    "the plot of @xmath29 as a function of the fourier modes will thus exhibits a peak corresponding to the mode @xmath40 . eventually , the critical radius @xmath0 is equal to the radius where the first peak is recorded .",
    "practically , @xmath41 is defined as the radius where the highest peak reaches a defined threshold value .    in figure [ modes ] , we report the amplitudes @xmath29 of the different fourier modes as a function of the radius @xmath3 .",
    "one can see that peaks appear only for @xmath42 cm , meaning @xmath43 cm .",
    "notice that in this case , @xmath44 for @xmath45 .     of the different fourier modes @xmath24 as a function of the radius @xmath3 . since the instability is characterized by periodic profiles , fourier peaks",
    "are observed in the spectrum only for radii @xmath46 .",
    "on the contrary , stable regions have no periodic characteristics .",
    "the critical radius @xmath43 cm is emphasized by a solid line .",
    "the experimental parameters are : @xmath47 rpm and @xmath48 cm.,width=302 ]    we have studied the dependence of @xmath0 on the height of water and the rotation speed .",
    "figure [ rc ] presents the mean ripple amplitude @xmath31 as a function of the radius @xmath3 for different values of @xmath2 at fixed @xmath49 rpm .",
    "first , one should note that the @xmath3-axis can be decomposed in 2 distinct regions : ( i ) if @xmath36 , all curves are nearly constant .",
    "this is the stable part of the sand - water interface .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath39 , all curves grow .",
    "notice that the critical radius is the same for all curves .",
    "this means that the birth of the instability is not controlled by the height of water .",
    "moreover , one can see how @xmath31 is inversely proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the higher the velocity gradient of the water is , the larger are the ripples .     as a function of the radius @xmath3 .",
    "different values of the water height @xmath2 are illustrated .",
    "the solid vertical line gives the critical radius @xmath0 .",
    "one should note that @xmath0 seems to be independent of @xmath2.,width=283 ]    plotting the critical radius @xmath0 as a function of the rotation speed @xmath1 [ see figure [ rc_w ] ] shows that the instability rises as sooner as the fluid speed is high .",
    "fitting the data with the single power law @xmath50 we found that @xmath51 is roughly equal to -1/2 . from the definition",
    "eq.([reynolds ] ) , we deduce that the _ critical _ reynolds number @xmath52 is constant and is @xmath53     as a function of the rotation speed @xmath1 .",
    "a fit using eq.([power ] ) is also illustrated .",
    "the power exponent is found to be equal to -1/2.,width=283 ]      using eq.([mode_moyen ] ) , we have studied the evolution of the mean ripple wavelength @xmath54 from the center of the plate , to the sides of the container . below the critical radius @xmath0 , no modulation is observed and @xmath54 is nearly zero .    within the unstable part of the interface , the measurement of the mean ripple wavelength is perturbated by the presence of `` defects '' .",
    "indeed , when two ripples collapse a jump of @xmath54 is recorded .",
    "we have noticed that on an image , the defects are almost situated at the same radius .",
    "their role is to adjust the number of ripples to the shear conditions . in order to increase the accuracy of the measurements",
    ", we have decomposed the whole @xmath3-range into intervals which do not contain such `` defects '' .",
    "we have found that @xmath54 grows linearly with the distance form the center of the plate : @xmath55 this observation is consistent with the existence of spirals with constant arm numbers in the considered intervals .",
    "moreover , we have noticed that the growth rate @xmath56 does not depend on the height of water but decreases with the rotation speed @xmath1 , according to a power law with power exponent -1 .",
    "eventually , we see that the mean ripple wavelength obeys the scaling @xmath57 in figure [ b_w ] , we have plotted @xmath56 as a function of @xmath1 as well as a fit using eq.([lambda_w ] ) .     of the mean ripple wavelength @xmath54 as a function of the rotation speed @xmath1 .",
    "a fit using eq.([lambda_w ] ) is also illustrated.,width=283 ]    an interpretation of the decrease of @xmath56 can be deduced from the phase diagram illustrated in fig.[diag_phase ] .",
    "as the height of water is changed at fixed rotation speed , no major modification of the patterns is observed ( nearly same wavelength ) .",
    "the consequence is that @xmath56 does not depend on @xmath2 . on the other way",
    ", we have seen that @xmath1 may cause the appearance of a second spiral .",
    "such an occurrence results in a larger amount of spiral arms , i.e. in a larger number of ripples .",
    "therefore , the mean ripple wavelength is lower when @xmath1 increases .",
    "the small values of @xmath56 at large @xmath1 values clearly shows this fact .",
    "an important observation is that _ no well - defined transition _ is observed in the curve giving @xmath54 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the decrease of the mean ripple wavelength seems to be continuous .",
    "the way of appearance of the so - called second spiral is one reason explaining this result . at @xmath58 rpm ,",
    "the second spiral is formed but has a smaller amplitude than the former spiral .",
    "the statistical weight of its wavelength is thus smaller than those of the former spiral . as the rotation speed increases , the second spiral amplitude growth .",
    "eventually , the measured mean ripple wavelength corresponds to the number of spiral arms of both spirals , i.e. becomes at least twice those measured when only one spiral was observed .",
    "one should note that since @xmath54 is divided by a factor larger than @xmath59 , we see that the hydrodynamics also tends to increase the number of arms of each spiral . this has been mentioned here - above as the origin of the `` defects '' in the spiral patterns .",
    "going deeper into the geometrical description of the patterns , we have measured the azimuthal angle @xmath4 of the spiral arms .",
    "this parameter is defined at a given point by the angle between a ripple crest and the tangential line to the circle centered on the plate and passing by the considered point [ see fig.[mesure_epsilon ] ] .",
    "practically , @xmath4 is measured between two concentric circles with radii differing from @xmath60 cm .",
    "is defined as the angle between the ripples crest ( dashed line ) and the tangential direction .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath4 is measured between two concentric circles ( solid lines ) of radii @xmath3 and @xmath61 respectively ( @xmath60 cm),width=226 ]    in order to determine the influence of the experimental parameters @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 on the azimuthal angle @xmath4 , we have proceeded as follows . at a given distance from the center of the container , i.e. a given @xmath3-value , and a given @xmath1-value , we measured @xmath4 for different values of the height of water @xmath2 .",
    "this process is repeated all over the container diameter .",
    "then , the height of water @xmath2 was fixed , and the procedure explained above was applied for different values of the rotation speed @xmath1 .",
    "we have noticed that the azimuthal angle @xmath4 increases with the distance from the center of the container as well as with the height of water @xmath2 and the rotation speed @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the measurements collapse when they are plotted as a function of the product @xmath5 [ see fig.[e_w ] ] .",
    "it appears that the experimental data could be considered as following a power law as well as saturating exponentially .",
    "we have chosen the exponential law in order to avoid the azimuthal angle to grow to infinity .",
    "the fit of the data sets shows that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the asymptotical value of the azimuthal angle at high @xmath5 values , @xmath64 and @xmath65 being fitting parameters .     as a function of the rotation speed @xmath1 multiplied by the height of water @xmath2 and the radial distance @xmath3",
    "a fit using eq.([eqaz ] ) is also illustrated.,width=283 ]    from eq.([eqaz ] ) , one can see that the azimuthal angle @xmath4 meets the horizontal axis , says @xmath4 = 0 , for the critical @xmath5 product value @xmath66 @xmath67 since the azimuthal angle is zero at this critical value @xmath68 , concentric circles must be observed for @xmath69 and spirals with azimuthal angles @xmath70 for values of @xmath71 .",
    "however , we have never observed such patterns .    an interpretation of this can be deduced from the consideration of the fluid momentum @xmath72 , where @xmath24 is the mass of fluid , and @xmath73 its linear speed . considering that @xmath74 kg",
    "m@xmath75 is the density of the fluid , and that the radius of the container @xmath76 m , one gets @xmath77 what contains the @xmath5 term .",
    "this thus means that the value of the azimuthal angle @xmath4 is governed by the fluid momentum , according to eq.([eqaz ] ) . combining eq.([eqaz ] ) and eq.([eqp ] )",
    "we are able to predict the fluid momentum corresponding to concentric circles .",
    "this critical momentum @xmath78 reads @xmath79 for fluid momentum @xmath80 , spirals with negative azimuthal angles must be created .",
    "the fact that no concentric circles are observed comes from the lack of granular transport for such small fluid momentum .",
    "indeed , ripples are only created when the grains are transported in the fluid , and this is only possible if the fluid shear stress exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "typically , ripples are observed only for fluid momentum @xmath81 kg m s@xmath82 .",
    "the instability encountered in our experiment creates patterns very similar to those observed in the case of a fluid flowing over a disk at rest @xcite .",
    "the instability resulting in such patterns takes place in the bdewadt boundary layer , i.e. in the boundary layer over the bottom disk .",
    "the patterns we observe are also similar to those observed in the thomas experiment @xcite . in the latter experiment",
    "the ripples are created by an acceleration of the container .",
    "the acceleration rate @xmath83 is somewhat analogue to the rotation speed @xmath1 presented here .",
    "hereafter , our experiment and the thomas one will be referred as `` granular '' one , while @xcite will be defined as `` fluid '' experiments .    despite the similarity between the patterns ,",
    "it is not obvious that the spiral patterns observed here are of the same nature as the fluid ones or as the thomas ones .",
    "we are now attempting to make some comparison in order to differentiate the different kinds of instabilities .",
    "it is important to notice that bdewadt flows are very complicated to create experimentally . as a consequence",
    ", there is a poor amount of data .",
    "the major difference between the `` granular experiments '' and the fluid ones is the dependence of the mean wavelength of the patterns on the distance from the center [ see table [ order ] ] . in thomas and our experiments ,",
    "the mean pattern wavelength increases with distance from the center while it is nearly constant in fluid experiments .",
    "however , the order of magnitude of @xmath54 for all experiments is about 1 cm .",
    "the values of the azimuthal angle of the spirals observed in fluid experiments range between @xmath84 and @xmath85 , what is nearly constant compared to the angles measured by thomas ( between @xmath86 to @xmath87 ) and the angles we measured ( from @xmath88 at low fluid momentum to @xmath89 at higher fluid momentum ) .",
    "the most important observation is that @xmath4 increases with the radius in our experiment , while it decreases in @xcite",
    ".    measurements of critical reynolds numbers show that @xmath52 decreases with the rotation speed in all experiments",
    ". however , the dependence is very slight in fluid experiments , compared to what is observed in granular ones .",
    "moreover , @xmath90 in fluid experiments and is only around @xmath91 here .    scaling +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the comparison of the orders of magnitude and the behaviors , we can conclude that the instability observed here is not the signature of an instability in the boundary layer .",
    "what we observed here are ripples , similar to those observed in coastal areas , but in a rotating frame .",
    "thomas pointed out the same conclusions . in both cases the spiral shape formed by the ripple crests may be due to the presence of centrifugal forces and other effects caused by the motion of the grains in the fluid .",
    "however , due to the differences between the experimental procedures followed in @xcite and here , the created patterns do not behave in the same way .",
    "an experimental study of the instability rising on a sand - water interface has been proposed .",
    "the formation of the spiral patterns have been shown and have been described with the help of a phase diagram .",
    "the properties of the critical radius where the instability forms have been studied .",
    "the critical radius @xmath0 is found to decrease with the rotation speed of the container , according a square law , giving a critical reynolds number equals to @xmath92 .",
    "the mean ripples wavelength is proportional to the distance from the center of the container and inversely proportional to the rotation speed of the container . studying the azimuthal angles of the spirals ,",
    "we have shown that this angle is governed by the momentum of the fluid @xmath72 , where @xmath24 is the mass of fluid , and @xmath73 its linear speed . from fits of experimental data ,",
    "the azimuthal angle is found to saturates at around @xmath89 for very high fluid momentum .",
    "a comparison between instabilities rising in the bdewadt boundary layer , as well as a comparison with an experiment of ripple formation in an accelerated frame , allows us to conclude that the observed patterns are not the signature of a fluid instability .",
    "the instability of the sand - water interface we observe are similar to natural ripples created in a rotating frame .",
