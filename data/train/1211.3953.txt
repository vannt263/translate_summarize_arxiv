    "r. p. feynman is credited for introducing the idea of a quantum simulator @xcite . at his keynote speech during the 1st conference on physics and computers in 1981",
    ", he claimed that because the laws of nature are not those of classical mechanics , it would be better to build a quantum simulation of a physical problem under the same quantum mechanical laws . for the following ten years",
    ", his contribution was somewhat hindered by the work of deutsch @xcite , who showed the existence of a universal quantum computer , a quantum mechanical generalization of the classical turing machine using quantum logic gates and algorithms .",
    "the concept of quantum simulators will reappear later in 1996 , when lloyd presented a general proof for feynman s conjecture @xcite .",
    "quantum simulators can surpass the capabilities of classical ones , where the complexity of a problem scales exponentially .",
    "lloyd argues @xcite that whereas the simulation of a general 40 spin@xmath0 particle system would be enough to outperform existing classical computers , the factorization of a 100-digit number with shor s algorithm would need of thousands of qubits to become nontrivial .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the first quantum device to beat classical computers would be a quantum simulator .",
    "but there is another reason why quantum simulators are attracting so much attention lately .",
    "they provide powerful analogies to understand the physics of most varied type of systems one can think of , including condensed - matter physics , high - energy physics , cosmology and quantum chemistry @xcite . when compared to the original systems , quantum simulators show an unprecedented degree of controllability over all physical parameter regimes .    in this work",
    ", we show how the physics of relativistic quantum mechanics can be simulated in a very different setting . that of circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) and superconducting qubits .",
    "we will focus our attention on the fundamental equation in relativistic quantum physics , the dirac equation .",
    "proposed by dirac himself in an attempt to combine quantum mechanics and special relativity in 1928 @xcite , this equation is the first one to describe elementary spin@xmath0 particles  such as the electron  and the existence of antimatter . here",
    ", we restrict our discussion to the simplest case of 1 + 1 dimensions for which the algebra of the dirac spinors can be reduced to that of standard pauli matrices @xcite . in the standard representation @xcite , the 1 + 1 dirac equation",
    "can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are pauli matrices , @xmath4 represents the momentum of a dirac particle of mass @xmath5 and @xmath6 the speed of light . soon after its introduction , schrdinger realised that there is something odd in the solution of this equation @xcite .",
    "the position for a free dirac particle can be integrated to give @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 this third term appears because the time derivative of the position operator is not a constant of motion , i.e. @xmath10 \\neq 0 $ ] , even for a free particle .",
    "given a general initial wavepacket , the expectation value @xmath11 shows an oscillating pattern with amplitude @xmath12 and frequency @xmath13 that is known as _",
    "zitterbewegung _ or _ jittering motion _  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour stems from the interference between positive and negative energy components .",
    "indeed , it is well established that initial states with only positive or negative components will not show any _ zitterbewegung _ @xcite . in spite of the appealing physics behind the dirac equation , there has never been an experiment to test the existence of such an effect .",
    "in fact , for relativistic electrons , one can estimate a _ zitterbewegung _ with an amplitude of about @xmath14 nm and a frequency of @xmath15 hz , making its eventual detection very demanding .",
    "there is another interesting property of the dirac equation related to the behaviour of relativistic dirac particles under the effect of an external scalar potential , @xmath16 in case of a nonrelativistic particle impinging against a semi - infinite step potential @xmath17 , we know that if the kinetic energy of the particle is smaller than the potential height , no propagating solutions exist at the other side of the potential barrier . in other words ,",
    "the particle penetrates slightly , but it will be eventually reflected .",
    "klein found out that eq .",
    "( [ klein ] ) for a relativistic dirac particle allows for propagating solutions beyond the potential barrier @xcite . and in the case of an infinitely high potential",
    ", the tunneling occurs with unit probability .",
    "more precisely , while for a small potential @xmath18 the particle with kinetic energy @xmath19 will be mostly transmitted , for a larger one @xmath20 it will be reflected .",
    "however , making even larger the potential @xmath21 the particle will propagate through the barrier . to explain this apparent paradox , one can make use of the idea of particle - antiparticle creation by the potential @xcite .",
    "a particle can go through the potential by turning into its antiparticle .    although the dirac equation is considered a milestone of relativistic quantum physics , playing a crucial role towards the later development of quantum field theories , in the last decades it has driven a renewed interest in different playgrounds .",
    "examples include : superconductivity , where bogoliubov quasi - particles can exhibit _ zitterbewegung _",
    "@xcite ; semiconductor physics , with a close analogy between the @xmath22 theory of energy bands in narrow - gap semiconductors and the dirac equation @xcite ; the physics of graphene , characterised by quasi - electrons behaving like relativistic dirac particles in two dimensions @xcite ; a proposal for generating relativistic scattering in optical latices @xcite ; photonic arrays with implementation of the quantum rabi model and the dirac equation @xcite ; and the physics of ion traps , where the vibrational and internal degrees of freedom of the ions can be made to follow relativistic quantum dynamics @xcite , or even behave as interacting bosons and fermions @xcite . in the spirit of quantum simulations",
    ", the latter represents an important advancement in terms of full quantum controllability of the dynamics and the retrieval of information through measurement .    here , we present a scheme for performing quantum simulations of relativistic quantum mechanics using state - of - the - art cqed technology .",
    "this is motivated by two reasons .",
    "first , since 2004 @xcite , cqed has become the quantum platform with the most promising perspectives in terms of scalability and coherence .",
    "second , there are crucial physical differences with respect to any previous implementation of the dirac equation and klein paradox . in our case ,",
    "the physics of a relativistic spin@xmath0 particle is simulated by the interaction of two degrees of freedom of different physical systems , i.e. , a standing wave in a superconducting resonator and the two lowest levels of a superconducting qubit , where none of them move at all .",
    "the position and momentum of the dirac particle are then encoded in its phase - space or field quadrature representation .",
    "this opens up new possibilities for combining intracavity fields with propagating quantum microwaves @xcite in scalabale quantum network architectures @xcite with delocalised and/or sequential interactions .",
    "for our protocol , we require a two - level superconducting qubit , as a flux qubit  @xcite , working at its symmetry point , strongly coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of the resonator . this interaction will be described by the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , we introduce three external classical microwave drivings , two transversal to the resonator @xcite , coupling only to the qubit , and one longitudinal that only sees the resonator mode . the time dependent hamiltonian of the complete system is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 being the ground and excited states of the qubit . here ,",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 stand for the photon energy and qubit energy splitting , whereas @xmath30 is the coupling constant .",
    "likewise , the two orthogonal drivings have real amplitude @xmath31 , @xmath32 , phase @xmath33 , and frequencies @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    ". finally , the longitudinal driving is characterised by an amplitude @xmath36 and a frequency @xmath34 . note that while we have chosen two of the drivings to be resonant with the resonator field mode , the other parameters will be set later on .",
    "for simplicity in our presentation , we will also assume that @xmath37 , i.e. qubit and resonator field interact resonantly as well .",
    "our derivation consists of two straightforward transformations .",
    "first , hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamildriv ] ) can be simplified using the reference frame rotating with the resonator frequency @xmath34 @xmath38 } \\sigma + e^{-i \\left [ ( \\nu-\\omega ) t   +   \\varphi \\right ]   } \\sigma^\\dag \\right ) } .",
    "\\label{hl1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    second , we will write this hamiltonian in another interaction picture with respect to the term @xmath39 . the resulting expression reads @xmath40 where we have introduced the rotated spin basis @xmath41 . to simplify this hamiltonian expression further",
    ", we can now set @xmath42 and assume the amplitude of the first driving @xmath31 to be large as compared to the rest of frequencies in  ( [ hi1 ] ) .",
    "this implies we can apply the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , yielding the effective hamiltonian @xmath43 where @xmath44 and we make use of standard quadratures of the electromagnetic field , i.e. dimensionless @xmath45 , @xmath46 , at variance with @xmath47 and @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ klein ] ) , with the commutation relation @xmath48 = i$ ] .",
    "note that @xmath31 does not appear in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "this is because the hamiltonian was obtained in an interaction picture with @xmath31 playing the role of a dominant frequency in the strong driving regime .",
    "the schrdinger equation of our system resembles that of the 1 + 1 dirac equation as in eqs .",
    "( [ dirac ] ) and ( [ klein ] ) , where the terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 are related to the speed of light and the mass , respectively .",
    "in addition , we have an external linear potential @xmath51 , that depends linearly on the position of the particle . clearly ,",
    "in the simulated dynamics , one can cover a wide range of physical parameters . while , for a fixed coupling strength @xmath30 , the simulated mass is proportional to the amplitude of the weak orthogonal driving @xmath32 , the strength of the linear potential can be tuned through the amplitude @xmath36 of the longitudinal driving .",
    "this is an interesting advantage over the implementation in ion traps , where a second ion is needed to simulate the external potential @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of a massless particle , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ hi1 ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the study of relativistic quantum effects , such as _ zitterbewegung _ or klein tunneling , should be done in the phase - space representation of the electromagnetic field in the superconducting resonator . in all numerical cases studied below",
    ", the initial state of the bosonic degree of freedom of the dirac particle is assumed to be a wavepacket with average position @xmath55 and average momentum @xmath56 , @xmath57    this coincides with the @xmath58quadrature representation of a coherent state of the electromagnetic field @xmath59 , @xmath60 being the vacuum state of the bosonic field , and @xmath61 the coherent displacement operator .    for the numerical simulations discussed below , we have chosen a value of the superconducting qubit and resonator frequencies of @xmath62 ghz , a qubit - field coupling of @xmath63 mhz and a strong transverse driving amplitude of @xmath64 mhz .",
    "in addition to being experimentally realistic , this value takes into account the limitation imposed by the qubit - resonator coupling constant @xmath30 on the strong driving fields .",
    "the interaction time needed is of about @xmath65 nsec , which is well below standard decoherence times in cqed experiments .",
    "in the absence of external potential , @xmath66 , the dirac equation for a free particle ( [ dirac ] ) does not couple the different spinor components .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian @xmath67 has two important limits depending on the value of the mass of the particle .",
    "first , in the massless case the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath68 allowing for straightforward interpretation of its dynamics in terms of phase - space representation .",
    "[ dirac - figs](a ) shows the evolution of a massless particle with initial state @xmath69 .",
    "being its spin in an eigenstate of @xmath2 , the effect that the interaction has is just to generate a coherent field displacement from its original position , the vacuum state @xmath60 , to the final one in which the state of the field is @xmath70 .",
    "this simulates the evolution of a massless free dirac particle moving at a speed of light stemming from @xmath49 .",
    "as we expect , the dynamics of this massless particle would be essentially unchanged if one assumes the initial state to have a non - zero value of the expectation value of momentum .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ dirac - figs](b ) , where the particle starts its trajectory with @xmath71 .",

    "the addition of an external potential has the effect of coupling the different energy components of the spinor . as before ,",
    "in the evolution under an external potential we can identify two limiting cases .",
    "a massless dirac particle is described by the hamiltonian @xmath123 . in figs .",
    "[ klein - figs ] ( a ) and ( b ) the evolution of the initial state @xmath69 and @xmath76 , respectively , is shown .",
    "we use the same set of parameters as in fig .",
    "[ dirac - figs ] , with the only addition of a linear potential of strength @xmath122 .",
    "again , starting with the qubit state , @xmath124 , allows for a simple interpretation .",
    "the initial state of the field remains coherent while being subject to two independent displacements .",
    "namely , as for the free - particle case , there is one in the @xmath58quadrature proportional to @xmath125 , and the second one induced by the potential that drags it down in the @xmath126quadrature .",
    "hence , the existence of such an external potential can not alter the rectilinear movement in position representation at the speed of light .",
    "this is precisely the effect of the klein paradox .",
    "a massless dirac particle may propagate through the potential barrier with finite probability , regardless of the potential strength .",
    "the tunneling is accompanied by the rotation of the positive energy components of the initial spinor . in our simple case",
    ", this means that the components with positive momentum components in the gaussian wavepacket will be pushed downwards by the potential becoming negative . and the rate at which this happens is given by @xmath127 .",
    "this explains why the only noticeable difference between the plots in figs .",
    "[ dirac - figs ] and [ klein - figs ] is in the value of @xmath128 .",
    "if the mass of the particle is large enough , then the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation should be a good approximation .",

    "the reconstruction of the wigner function will allow to characterise what type of dynamics is being simulated .",
    "this can be done either using intracavity techniques @xcite or allowing the quantum field to leak the superconducting resonator for its subsequent measurement .",
    "this will require the use of methods for reconstructing the moments of a propagating quantum microwave signal @xcite , already available in cqed .",

    "the degree of controllability offered by this scheme would allow to study interesting physical phenomena far beyond what any direct experiment has achieved .",
    "a relevant example is the possibility of implementing the foldy - wouthuysen transformation , which for decades has remained a purely abstract construction .",
