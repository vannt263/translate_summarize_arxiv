    "the d  detector at the fermilab tevatron was completed in 1992 and took data during the 1992 - 1993 tevatron collider run ( run  1a ) and from 1994 - 1996 ( run  1b and 1c ) .",
    "this paper describes a scintillator upgrade to the d  wide angle muon system which was fabricated for run  1b and 1c . a cutaway isometric view of the detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : det_iso ] where the central detectors , calorimeter , and muon detectors are shown .",
    "2.0 cm    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the effect of the scintillator veto on the first level muon trigger was substantial .",
    "the high p@xmath0 dimuon trigger was reduced by approximately a factor of 3 when the veto for the top four octants were added to the trigger .",
    "the low p@xmath0 dimuon trigger was reduced by a factor of approximately 1.6 .",
    "the scintillation counters built for the d  muon system worked very well during the latest data taking run .",
    "the scintillator and fiber design chosen performed as expected .",
    "the phototubes chosen had a rather sharp gain variation during the intial running but were stable after the intial burn - in period .",
    "the scintillators were effective in rejecting background from cosmic rays , out - of - time accelerator muons , and backscatter particles , while maintaining an efficiency greater than 99% .",
    "we thank the staffs at fermilab and the collaborating institutions for their contributions to this work , and acknowledge support from the department of energy and national science foundation ( u.s.a . ) , cnpq ( brazil ) , departments of atomic energy and science and education ( india ) , and conacyt ( mexico ) .",
