    "the formation and observation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy ion collisions are important goals of modern nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "suppression of high @xmath0 hadron yields  @xcite is one of the most important features observed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "theoretically this is attributed to the interaction between jets ( hard partons ) and the bulk matter @xcite .",
    "this offers us an excellent opportunity to study the interaction of partons inside the system and , consequently , properties of the matter under extreme conditions .",
    "however the observed centrality - dependence of hadronic jet quenching does nt show up in direct photon production@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the role of jet quenching on direct photon production . for this purpose",
    ", we need a careful consideration of three components : 1 ) the space - time evolution of the hot dense matter or the bulk matter ; 2 ) hard parton production and propagation in the bulk and 3 ) all sources of direct photons .",
    "the space - time evolution of the hot dense matter is achieved by using three dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamic simulations of bulk matter @xcite which have already been tested against a vast body of low @xmath0 hadron data at rhic .",
    "the interaction between hard parton and the bulk so that energy loss of the hard parton is formulated via the bdmps framework @xcite and tested on pion suppression at various centralities .",
    "four significant sources are considered in this paper : leading order contribution in primordial nn scattering , thermal contribution , contribution from jet - photon conversion and from jet fragmentation .",
    "there are possible sources ignored at present study : the medium - induced photon radiation is expected to contribute at low transverse momentum region where thermal contribution dominants .",
    "the interaction involving non - equilibrated soft partons may also produce direct photons , but the preequilibrium time interval is much shorter than the life time of the equilibrated matter ( @xmath1 fm/@xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore energy loss of hard parton in the bulk will directly effect two direct photon sources , jet - photon conversion and from jet fragmentation .",
    "we will see the role of jet quenching on direct photon production clearly via investigating those production in au - au collisions at different centralities where various sizes of hot dense matter are formed .",
    "certainly different sizes of bulks will also contribute thermal photon production differently which will not be discussed in detail in this paper .",

    "_ thermal production .",
    "_ in high energy nuclear collisions , the density of secondary partons is so high that the quarks and gluons rescatter and eventually thermalize to form a bubble of hot qgp .",
    "thermal photons can be produced via interaction between bulk particles during the whole history of the evolution of hot matter .",
    "the interaction of bulk particles and the bulk properties can be reflected by the emission rate of direct photons in the qgp phase@xcite and in the hadronic phase@xcite , noted as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the number of photons emitted from a medium per unit space - time volume with temperature @xmath66 .",
    "total yields of thermal photons can be obtained by summing the emission rate over the space - time volume as @xmath83 with @xmath84 , @xmath85 the photon s four momentum in the laboratory frame and @xmath67 a local fluid velocity .",
    "_ jet fragmentation .",
    "_ at any stages of the evolution of a jet ( final state parton emission ) , there is a possibility of emitting photons .",
    "the existence of a qgp affects the results because energetic partons lose their energy prior to fragmentation . in this work , we assume fragmentation of partons only outside the plasma , which is similar to high @xmath0 hadron production from jet fragmentation .    in @xmath43 collisions , there is no formation of qgp and no energy loss of hard parton in qgp .",
    "higher order contributions to direct photon production can be considered as jet fragmentation and be calculated as @xmath86 with photon fragmentation functions @xmath87 being the probability for obtaining a photon from a parton @xmath2 which carries a fraction @xmath88 of the parton s momentum .",
    "so @xmath89 is the transverse momentum carried by the parton @xmath2 before fragmentation and @xmath90 .",
    "the effective fragmentation functions for obtaining photons from partons can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "we use the parameterized solutions by owens  @xcite .    in case of heavy ion collisions where a qgp is formed",
    ", energy loss of hard partons in a plasma should be taken into account .",
    "this can be done via modified fragmentation functions  @xcite @xmath91\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\quad+e^{-\\frac{l}{\\lambda_{c}}}\\ : d_{\\gamma / c}^{0}(z_{c},q^{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath92 and @xmath93 being the rescaled momentum fractions carried by the parton @xmath2 and the emitted gluons before fragmentation .",
    "@xmath94 is mean free path of the parton @xmath2 in the plasma , @xmath95 is the path length of each parton traversing the plasma .",
    "thus , in heavy ion collisions , contributions from fragmentation become @xmath96    _ jet photon conversion with jet energy loss_. when hard partons propagate in a plasma , they also collide with thermal partons and produce direct photons via compton process and the quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "we call this process jet - photon conversion , since it is a conversion of a jet into a photon with almost the same momentum as the one of originating jet parton .",
    "contribution from the jet - photon conversion is calculated by integration of conversion rate over the space - time evolution of the hot and dense matter in the qgp phase @xmath97 the photon production rate by annihilation and compton scattering of hard partons in the medium @xcite @xmath98\\label{eq : jpc_rate}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the photon energy in the local rest frame , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and the strong coupling @xmath102 being temperature dependent as in eq .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : c12 - 34 ] , the calculated @xmath0 spectra of direct photons in au+au collisions at @xmath114 gev at centrality 0 - 20% and 20 - 40% are compared to phenix data @xcite .",
    "the phenix data are reproduced within our multi - component model remarkably well .",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath115 is obtained by dividing a @xmath0 spectrum in nucleus - nucleus collisions by the @xmath116-scaled @xmath0 spectrum in @xmath43 collisions .",
    "the calculation of direct photons in @xmath43 collisions includes the leading order contribution plus fragmentation contribution . in high @xmath0 regions ,",
    "our result agrees with the phenix data@xcite,@xcite reasonably well : so we use it to calculate nuclear modification .",
    "it also provides a baseline calculation with the lo contribution and fragmentation contribution in au+au collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : raa3 ] shows how the nuclear modification factor for direct photons , @xmath115 , depends on centrality and on energy loss .",
    "data for 0 - 10% centrality are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : raa3](a ) shows centrality dependence of @xmath115 compared to the phenix data .",
    "the three curves are respectively 0 - 10% ( dotted line ) , 20 - 30% ( solid line ) , and 40 - 50% ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "@xmath115 has a weak centrality dependence at high @xmath0 region .",
    "this result is consistent with the observed phenomenon  @xcite that the @xmath0-integrated ( for @xmath117  gev/@xmath2 ) @xmath115 of direct photons is almost independent of collision centrality .",
    "does this imply a very weak effect from jet quenching ?",
    "figure  [ fig : raa3](b ) answers this question ( here for the most central collisions ) : comparing calculations with ( dotted line ) and without energy loss ( solid line ) , one finds a difference of up to 40% .",
    "so the effect of parton energy loss is quite visible in the @xmath0 range between @xmath118 gev/@xmath2 and more than @xmath119 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "if we would do the @xmath115 calculations without energy loss , the difference between central and semiperipheral collisions would be about 20% , wheras the complete calculation gives the same result for all centralities , within 5% .",
    "we have to admit that we talk about small effects , requiring experimental data with relative errors of less than 5to observe the effects .",
    "parton energy loss in the plasma suppresses the fragmentation contributions and jet - photon conversion .",
    "so we study the ratios of the contribution with energy loss to the one without energy loss , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eloss ] ( ( a ) for fragmentation and ( b ) for jet - photon conversion ) . energy loss in the plasma depends on the path length of the hard parton inside the plasma , which turns out to depend on the collision centrality .",
    "we do see a similar centrality dependence of the suppression for @xmath73 ( jet quenching effect ) in fragmentation contributions and jet - photon conversion .",
    "we calculated the centrality - dependence of @xmath0 spectra for direct photons in au+au collisions at the rhic energy , based on a realistic data - constrained ( 3 + 1)-d hydrodynamic description of the expanding hot and dense matter , a reasonable treatment of propagation of partons and their energy loss , and a systematic consideration of main sources of direct photons . in this study , four main sources are considered , namely , leading order ( lo ) contribution from primordial elementary scatterings , thermal radiation from the fluids , fragmentation from hard partons , and jet photon conversion ( jpc ) .",
    "similar work  @xcite has been done before the appearance of the most recent data  @xcite .",
    "our results agree nicely with the recent low @xmath0 data .",
    "the role of jet quenching in the high @xmath0 region of direct photons production has been checked via fragmentation photons and jet photon conversion sources .",
    "for these two sources , the suppression of the photon rate due to parton energy loss is significant in central au+au collisions , and becomes less important towards peripheral collisions , similar to the suppression for meson production .",
    "since experimentally one may separate isolated photons ( lo+jpc ) and associate photons ( fragmentation photons ) , our prediction may be tested in the future .    considering the total yields of direct photons ,",
    "the contribution from fragmentation and conversion are small , contributing between 5% and 10% .",
    "however , parton energy loss plays nevertheless an important role : without it , these second order effects would contribute significantly . without jet quenching , the nuclear modification factors @xmath115 would depend visibly on the centrality of the collisions .",
    "a strong energy loss is actually necessary to get the centrality scaling of @xmath115 in our calculation  a centrality scaling which has observed by the phenix collaboration . in this sense",
    ", properties of the bulk matter affect the photon yields at intermediate values of @xmath0 , via the parton energy loss .",
