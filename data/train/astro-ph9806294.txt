    "clusters of galaxies are thought to form by accretion of subunits in a hierarchical bottom up scenario .",
    "this view arises naturally in various theories of cosmic structure formation , as f.i .",
    "the cold dark matter dominated scenarios .",
    "numerical simulations on scales of cosmological relevance ( e.g. cen & ostriker 1994 , colberg et al .",
    "1997 ) revealed that mergings happen along preferential directions , called density caustics , which define matter flows , at whose intersection rich clusters are formed .",
    "detailed high resolution simulations of such collisions were performed by mcglynn & fabian ( 1984 ) and roettiger , burns & loken ( 1993 ) , who studied cluster - cluster and cluster - group merging , respectively . in the simulations , the two cores have two or three encounters before dissipating all the kinetic energy :",
    "in particular , the less massive cluster emerges as a partially dispersed galaxy population along the down merger side of the dominant cluster .",
    "members of the merging cluster , trapped nearby the dominant core , create an apparent clumpiness on either side of the center .",
    "the kinetic energy is dissipated mostly by the particles in external regions of the clusters , which expand creating a common envelope , while the cores do not change dramatically .    from the observational point of view , the detection of a large fraction of clusters which present substructures ( see f.i .",
    "kriessler & beers 1997 and references therein ) revealed that these systems are still dynamically young and show evidence of mergings .",
    "the best studied examples are a2256 ( briel , henry & bhringer 1992 ) , where a small group is detected in the x - ray band nearby the cluster center , and coma , where a number of substructures are revealed ( biviano et al .",
    "in particular , burns et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , on the basis of the detection of a large scale x - ray emitting filament connecting coma with the ngc4839 group , suggest that the group has probably already passed the cluster center .",
    "the most spectacular phenomena are expected to be seen when the merging involves repeated collisions or even coalescence of comparable units : during the intermediate stages , the clusters form structures and complexes on scales of few megaparsecs .",
    "rich superclusters are the ideal environment for the detection of cluster mergings , because the peculiar velocities induced by the enhanced local density of the large scale structure favour the cluster - cluster and cluster - group collisions , in the same way as the caustics seen in the simulations .",
    "the most remarkable examples of cluster merging seen at an intermediate stage is found in the central region of the shapley concentration , the richest supercluster of clusters found within @xmath0 ( zucca et al .",
    "1993 ; hereafter h = h@xmath1/100 ) . on the basis of the two - dimensional distribution of galaxies of the cosmos / ukstj catalogue ( yentis et al .",
    "1992 ) , it is possible to find several complexes of interacting clusters , which suggest that the entire region is dynamically active .",
    "therefore , this supercluster represents a unique laboratory where it is possible to follow cluster mergings and to test related astrophysical consequences , as the formation of radio halos , relicts and wide angle tail radio sources and the presence of post - starburst ( e+a ) galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we perform a substructure analysis of the a3558 cluster complex using a non - parametric , scale independent algorithm , based on the adaptive kernel density estimator .",
    "this method could be considered alternative or complementary to the wavelet decomposition analysis , extensively used in literature . in particular ,",
    "a wavelet analysis of this complex was done by girardi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and , limited to the dominant cluster a3558 , by dantas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : these analyses offer an opportunity to test the two methods on a real , rather complex situation . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the method , in section 3 the used samples are presented and in section 4 a brief discussion of the subclumps is reported ; finally in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "in order to identify the substructures in our sample and to assess their significance , we followed the method known as  algorithm driven by the density estimate for the identification of clusters \" ( hereafter dedica ) developed by pisani ( 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "this is a non - parametric , scale independent method , whose output gives a list of groups with the related statistical significance , their members , and a list of isolated objects .",
    "here we remind briefly the main steps of the method .",
    "first , we estimated the density field @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the @xmath4-dimensional position vector ) using the  adaptive kernel probability estimator \" for which @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kernel estimator of @xmath2 , @xmath7 is the position of the @xmath8 galaxy , @xmath9 is the number of objects in the sample and @xmath10 is the size of the gaussian kernel defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of dimensions of the sample .",
    "we stress that we choose the gaussian form for the kernel basically because it is differentiable in all its domain .",
    "this is a crucial feature in order to identify the density peaks according to eq .",
    "[ eq : path ] . even if the most efficient ( i.e. with minimum variance ) kernel form is the epanechnikov function , silverman ( 1986 ) showed that difference in the use of the two forms is negligible .",
    "indeed , what is crucial for cluster detection is the width and not the shape of the kernels , provided that they satisfy the normalization and convergence condition ( see section i of pisani 1993 ) .",
    "the estimate of the kernel sizes is done through an iterative procedure , starting from a large value for the kernel sizes and progressively reducing them until the minimum of the  cross - validation function \" is reached .",
    "the various steps are the following ( for details see pisani 1993 , 1996 ) :    \\1 ) set the first guess ( @xmath13 ) of the size as @xmath14 where @xmath15 } \\sqrt { { 1 \\over d } \\sum^{d}_{l=1 } s_{l}^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the standard deviation of the @xmath17 coordinate ( silverman 1986 ) . in this step , a large starting @xmath18 is selected : note that for a symmetric gaussian distribution with dispersion @xmath19 and same number of points of our samples , we have @xmath20 ;    \\2 ) set the following iteration ( @xmath21 ) as @xmath22 ;    \\3 ) take as  pilot function \" @xmath23 the density kernel estimate @xmath6 with sizes @xmath10 fixed at @xmath24 @xmath25 ( see eq .",
    "27 and 28 of pisani 1993 ) ;    \\4 ) set @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a  local bandwidth \" defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 now , the sizes of the kernels @xmath30 are depending somehow from the local density through the factor @xmath27 : the higher is the density , the smaller are the @xmath30 ;    \\5 ) evaluate the cross - validation function @xmath31 ( \\sigma_n)$ ] of the @xmath21 estimate of the density @xmath32 ( eq . 4 and 5 of pisani 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 ( \\sigma_n)$ ] estimates the quadratic deviation between @xmath6 and the  true \" parent density function @xmath2 ( see eq .",
    "33 of pisani 1993 ) .    the steps from ( 2 ) to ( 5 )",
    "are iterated until the minimum of @xmath31 ( \\sigma_n)$ ] is reached : the corresponding kernel widths @xmath30 give the optimal density estimate @xmath33 as : @xmath34    peaks in the density distribution function are assumed to define the presence of clusters ( in this section we use the word cluster in the statistical sense ) : the local maxima of @xmath33 are found by solving for each starting @xmath8 galaxy position ( @xmath35 ) the iterative equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the original position of the @xmath8 galaxy .",
    "( [ eq : path ] ) defines a path from the original position to a limiting point along the maximum gradient of the function @xmath38 all starting points which reach the same limiting position @xmath39 for @xmath40 define a cluster . from the analysis of the distribution of the distances between the various @xmath39 in our samples",
    ", we decided to consider coincident all the limiting points that differ by less than @xmath41 arcmin .",
    "the significance of the cluster is estimated by calculating first the likelihood function of the sample @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the contribution to the density function of the @xmath44 cluster @xmath45 , calculated as @xmath46 where the sum is done on the galaxies belonging to the @xmath44 cluster and @xmath47 is the number of clusters found in the sample . for @xmath48",
    "we refer to the set of isolated galaxies , i.e. those that did not reach a @xmath39 shared with other object .",
    "then the likelihood of the @xmath44 cluster ( @xmath49 ) is calculated by replacing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : likelihood ] ) the sizes @xmath30 of the kernels of the substructure objects with @xmath50 , i.e. the kernel size of the background .",
    "the ratio @xmath51 is distributed as a chi square variable with one degree of freedom and is related to the probability that the density distribution is better described by the presence of the @xmath44 cluster rather than by a uniform background .    in an ideal case , it would be possible to determine @xmath50 by using the isolated galaxies , because they are likely to be part of the background .",
    "however , also local fluctuations of the density field of a cluster can be identified as local maxima and hence this fact causes a misidentification of cluster members as isolated galaxies .    a method to identify",
    "really isolated galaxies is to check the relative contribution to the total density of the kernel of the @xmath8 galaxy in the position @xmath7 ( pisani 1996 ) , given by @xmath52 this equation estimates the probability that a  nominally \" isolated galaxy is really part of the background",
    ". we found that for our samples @xmath53 , hence we can conclude that there are no really isolated galaxies . note that the estimate of @xmath54 is independent from the cluster identification step ( eq . [ eq : path ] ) .    in order to determine a value for the background",
    ", we plotted the histogram of the kernel sizes @xmath30 , which is a symmetric distribution with a tail at higher values . we choose as @xmath50 the value at the beginning of the tail ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : histo]a in sect .",
    "the group significances calculated from the values of @xmath55 are strictly correct only if the background is well determined , that is not our case .",
    "for this reason we regard the @xmath55 only as a ranking parameter for the existence of the groups and we consider only subclusters in the tail at higher values of this parameter ( see fig . [",
    "fig : histo]b in sect .",
    "this choice corresponds approximately to a  formal \" significance of @xmath56 .",
    "we forced the background at various reasonable densities in order to check the robustness of our results , finding that the general clustering pattern of our samples is not strongly dependent on the poorly known global background density .    as a test of the efficiency of this method , we applied dedica to simulated gaussian distributions , where no substructures are expected .",
    "we performed various simulations of 2-d and 3-d gaussians , with a number of points between 300 and 700 ( which are the approximate numbers of galaxies in our various samples ) , finding that the success rate ( i.e. absence of significant substructures ) of dedica is always between @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( depending on the number of objects ) . in the cases in which dedica finds significant substructures ,",
    "the numbers of these  spurious \" groups is of the order of 2 - 3 .",
    "this method differs from the wavelet decomposition because it is non - parametric and scale - independent .",
    "indeed , the wavelet method is a deconvolution procedure , which assumes an exploring function , which is fixed throughout the whole sample volume . on the contrary",
    ", dedica adopts a kernel function , which is locally density dependent and in this sense is not a deconvolution method ( silverman 1986 ) .",
    "the wavelet analysis is able to detect structures depending on the scale of the exploring function , while dedica does not requires any assumption on the scale of clusters .",
    "in a series of papers ( bardelli et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 , 1998 , hereafter paper 1 , 2 and 3 ; venturi et al . 1997 ) we performed a detailed multiwavelength study of the a3558 cluster complex , a remarkable association formed by three aco ( abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ) clusters a3556 , a3558 and a3562 , already noticed by shapley ( 1930 ) .",
    "this structure is approximately at the geometrical center of the shapley concentration and can be considered the core of this supercluster . by the use of multifibre spectroscopy , we obtained 714 redshifts of galaxies in this region , confirming that the complex is a single connected structure , elongated perpendicularly to the line of sight .",
    "in particular , the number of measured redshifts of galaxies belonging to a3558 is @xmath59 , and thus this is one of the best sampled galaxy clusters in the literature .",
    "moreover , two smaller groups , dubbed sc 1327 - 312 and sc 1329 - 313 , were found both in optical ( paper 1 ) and x - ray band ( breen et al .",
    "1994 ; paper 2 ) .",
    "in particular , in paper 2 we detected a bridge of x - ray emitting hot gas connecting a3558 and sc 1327 - 313 ( and possibly extending to a3562 , see figure 7 of ettori et al .",
    "1997 ) which resembles the structure between coma and ngc4839 described by burns et al .",
    "the presence of this feature strongly supports the suggestion by metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1994 ) that a3562 already encountered a3558 : the bridge could be the tail of gas left by a3562 after the first passage through a3558 ( for details see burns et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the clusters of this complex attracted the attention of various investigators , who applied several statistical tests in order to detect substructures .",
    "bird ( 1993 ) , applying both 2-d and 3-d tests to galaxies in a3558 , found three subclumps : the first coincides with the cluster center and corresponds to the main component , the second lies eastward of the cluster center and the third is in the south - east quadrant .    in paper 3 , applying the test developed by dressler & shectman ( 1988 ) , we detected a group at @xmath60 arcmin from the position of the second clump of bird ( 1993 ) . from the analysis of the isodensity contours and the velocity distribution histograms",
    ", there was evidence of another density excess at @xmath61 arcmin southward of the a3558 center .",
    "moreover , a3558 , sc1329 - 313 and a3556 appear to have bimodal velocity distributions .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using a modified version of the bi - dimensional wavelet decomposition which takes into account also the dynamical information , individuated in a3558 the same subclumps found by bird ( 1993 ) and by us ( paper 3 ) , and an additional substructure westward of the center of a3562 .",
    "dantas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using the bi - dimensional wavelet decomposition in a3558 , detected a bimodality in the core of the cluster .",
    "the authors claim that this result resolves both the cd offset problem ( in fact the dominant galaxy was suspected not to be at rest with respect to the cluster velocity centroid , gebhardt & beers 1991 ) , and the  @xmath62 problem \" ( paper 2 ) , by decreasing the central velocity dispersion from @xmath63 km / s to @xmath64 km / s    analysing a rosat pspc image of a3558 , we noted ( paper 2 ) that the diffuse emission of the hot gas is better described by two components , one centered on the geometrical center of the cluster and the other on the cd galaxy .",

    "this is an indication that the dynamical processes have not had enough time to destroy the substructures and to smooth the galaxy distribution .",
    "the bi - dimensional analysis revealed that the inner core ( @xmath182 ) of this cluster could be separated in two groups : @xmath183 , which contains the dominant galaxy , and @xmath184 .",

    "the velocity histogram of @xmath201 is asymmetric with a tail toward low velocities : the peak of the distribution is located at @xmath202 km / s , a value consistent with the cd velocity .",
    "the bi - dimensional clump @xmath203 has a positional coincidence in the plane of the sky with @xmath204 .",

    "this density excess was revealed also by the presence of two peaks in the velocity distribution in the third radial shell of paper 3 .",
    "the dynamical parameters of the lower velocity peak are well consistent with those of @xmath205 , while the higher velocity peak is probably associated to galaxies of group @xmath206 which also fall in this shell .",

    "as noted in paper 3 , this substructure is in the region of a3558 which show a significant enhancement of temperature ( markevitch & vikhlinin 1997 ) .",
    "another relevant condensation is the group @xmath208 ( or @xmath209 ) , in the south - west part of a3558 , whose isodensity contours appear elongated .",
    "an interesting feature of the a3558 complex is the presence of a number of clumps between a3558 and a3562 , which form a series connecting the two clusters , starting with @xmath206 and @xmath210 just on the east of a3558 . in the x - ray band",
    "there are two relevant diffuse emissions dubbed sc 1327 - 312 and sc 1329 - 314 ( breen et al . 1994 ; paper 2 ) already noted also in the optical band ( paper 1 ) .",
    "the sc 1327 - 312 group probably corresponds to @xmath211 , even if there is an offset of @xmath212 arcmin between the two positions . in paper 3",

    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm      from the analysis of the three - dimensional sample it is possible to find out three components .",
    "the main cluster component appears to be @xmath215 , with a velocity dispersion of @xmath216 km / s , consistent with that found in paper 3 .",
    "note the presence of other two clumps ( @xmath217 and @xmath218 ) probably connected with the main cluster .",
    "the dedica algorithm is a non - parametric , scale independent method for substructure analysis .",
    "we used this algorithm on both a bi - dimensional and a three - dimensional ( i.e. using the galaxy velocity as third coordinate ) sample in the region of the a3558 complex .",
    "the bi - dimensional analysis finds a large number of clumps in correspondence of evident density peaks , but it appears insufficient to correctly characterize all the substructures : in fact the three - dimensional analysis finds several cases in which different subclumps aligned along the line of sight are seen as single bi - dimensional peaks .    on the other hand , the not uniform and incomplete sampling in velocity may in principle lead to miss some structures in the three - dimensional analysis .",
    "however , this incompleteness does not seem to introduce significant artifacts , because there is a good correspondence between the three - dimensional subcluster centers and most of the bi - dimensional density excesses .",
    "a number of these subclusters were already detected in paper 3 by the simultaneous use of various techniques , such as the classical shape estimators , the west et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and the dressler & shectman ( 1988 ) tests and the analysis of the velocity histograms with the kmm algorithm ( ashman , bird & zepf 1994 ) .",
    "the efficiency of these methods depends on the properties of the substructures : for example , the west et al . test recovers groups as departures from the mirror symmetry of the main cluster",
    ", while the dressler & shectman method is insensitive to subclusters which are superimposed along the line of sight or with similar mean velocity and velocity dispersion . this fact led pinkney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to recommend for the substructure analysis of clusters the use of a wide battery of statistical tests . under this aspect ,",
    "the dedica algorithm is more efficient and faster and permits a direct estimate of the significance of the detected clump , without relying on long computer simulations .",
    "a direct comparison with the results obtained with the wavelet decomposition analysis is not straightforward because of the different starting samples .",
    "the subclusters detected by girardi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are a subset of our sample , revealing that the two methods are similar as discussed by fadda et al .",
    "the difference in the dynamical parameters are probably due to the fact that the method of girardi et al . is not fully three - dimensional .",
    "our bi - dimensional analysis of the center of a3558 gives the same results of dantas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , i.e. the inner 0.5 abell radius region is formed by two clumps , one of which ( @xmath183 ) approximatively centered ( within @xmath185 arcmin ) on the x - ray excess of the cd galaxy . on the contrary , our three - dimensional analysis reveals a more complicated situation .",
    "it is possible to consider two main hypotheses for the origin of the a3558 cluster complex : one is that we are observing a cluster - cluster collision , just after the first core - core encounter , while the other considers repeated , incoherent group - group and group - cluster mergings focused at the geometrical center of a large scale density excess ( the shapley concentration ) .    in the first scenario , we could speculate that a cluster collided onto a3558 and its remnants are visible as the overdensity regions of sc 1327 - 312 , sc1329 - 313 and a3562 : the connection of hot gas between a3558 and sc1327 - 312 found in paper 2 could be a trace of such a collision . in this framework ,",
    "a3556 would be formed by the members of the intervening cluster remained in the backside part of the merging direction .",
    "therefore , galaxies outside a3558 would belong to the destroyed cluster and to the outer regions of the more massive target cluster and form the clumpiness expected in the simulations .",
    "caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) suggested that the infall of a group onto a cluster may trigger starburst phenomena on its galaxies .",
    "indeed they found a number of objects showing recent star formation in the filament connecting the coma cluster with ngc4839 , which was suspected by burns et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to have already passed the core of coma . in order to check",
    "if the cluster interaction modifies the galaxy spectral emission , we cross - correlated our velocity sample with the photometric sample of metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which contains @xmath219 magnitudes and the @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 colours to @xmath223 .",
    "the use of the velocity sample , limited in the @xmath108 $ ] km / s range , eliminates the ambiguity of possible colour effects due to objects at various redshifts .",
    "we consider  blue galaxies \" those with @xmath224 : this choice should allow to exclude the  red sequence \" in the colour - magnitude planes typical of the presence of clusters and to have at the same time a large number of objects ( 157 ) in the blue sample .",
    "dividing the galaxies into two groups , i.e. those that are in significant groups and those that are outside them , we found that the fractions of blue objects are @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively .",
    "the reddest group is @xmath186 with a fraction of @xmath227 of blue galaxies and this supports the idea that the group could be considered as a preexisting , already relaxed cluster ( that is a3558 ) .",
    "the bluest groups are @xmath228 and @xmath229 with @xmath230 and @xmath226 of blue galaxies and are in the expected position in the scenario of a cluster - cluster collision , i.e. between a3562 and a3558 .    in the second scenario , instead of a single merging phenomenon ,",
    "there would have been a series of minor mergings and collisions , confined in a relatively small region by the deep potential well of the supercluster . in this case the different  colours \" of the groups would be related only to the different initial galaxy morphological composition of the merging components .",

    ", in preparation ) , through the analysis of a inter - cluster galaxy redshift survey ( bardelli et al .",
    "1997 ) , and of the implied peculiar velocities , will help in discriminating among these two scenarios : in fact , peculiar velocities of the order of @xmath231 km / s at the center of the shapley concentration would point toward the hypothesis of a cluster - cluster collision , while significantly lower velocities would be consistent with the second scenario ."
