    "amorphous materials have been of prime importance in our technology for millennia , from antique glass works to fashionable phones made of metallic glass .",
    "one of the new frontiers of the amorphous technology is in the design of amorphous drugs  @xcite , better absorbed by our metabolism with less side effects , that would be stable at room temperature .",
    "the main obstacle is a lack of our basic understanding of the physics of the glass transition , without any operative consensus despite half a century of intensive research  @xcite .",
    "when cooled below its freezing temperature while avoiding crystallization , a liquid becomes supercooled . upon further cooling ,",
    "the dynamics slows down by many orders of magnitude leading to a material that is mechanically a solid without long range positional order , thus called amorphous .",
    "it is now known that the dynamics in a supercooled liquid is heterogeneous , with a length scale that grows when approaching the glass transition  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the lengthscale defined by the dynamical heterogeneity is not static ( one - time spatial correlation ) but dynamic ( two - time spatial correlation ) .",
    "the existence of a static ( structural ) length that would grow and accompany the dynamic heterogeneities is still not clear in the general case .",
    "however , in a class of system that includes polydisperse hard spheres , we have shown  @xcite that some medium range bond orientational order reminiscent of the crystal exists in the supercooled liquid and grows toward the glass transition in the same way as the dynamical heterogeneity .",
    "the presence in glassy materials of structures locally reminiscent of crystals has been confirmed recently in amorphous silicon  @xcite and in a metallic glass  @xcite .",
    "while bond orientational order is a member of the class of many - body correlations between neighboring particles , it is yet unclear if a similar lengthscale can be extracted from two - body correlation functions .",
    "this question is particularly important considering that the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) of the glass transition takes as input only two - body quantities , and similarly modern spin - glass - type theories of the structural glass transition  @xcite are not taking explicitly into account many - body correlations .    at polydispersities over @xmath0 % ,",
    "the system needs to fractionate to crystallize  @xcite .",
    "what is the bond order of the reference crystal is then unclear and may challenge our scenario .",
    "this is a situation reminiscent of binary hard sphere systems of size ratio close to one  @xcite where growing bond order have not been reported  @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that even in binary systems locally favored structures play a role in the slowing down of the dynamics in some cases  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent studies by mosayebi et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that there are static growing lengths in binary lennard - jones and soft sphere mixtures .",
    "they estimated the static length by looking at the spatial correlation of the degree of non - affine deformation of inherent structures under shear deformation .    in the present study we will use polydisperse hard sphere systems , where we know how to extract meaningful many - body correlations , and look for a two - body quantity that would show the same behavior as the bond order .",
    "we will show that the two - body part of the free energy ( which for hard potentials corresponds to the two - body part of the structural entropy ) is unable to capture medium range bond ordered regions or to yield correlation lengths meaningful from the point of view of the glass transition .",
    "we thus confirm the medium range crystalline order scenario and test its robustness against increasing polydispersity .",
    "since bond orientational order is directly linked to the underlying crystalline structures , we will then address the important question of what is the mechanism responsible for the avoidance of crystallization .",
    "we will show that in the metastable fluid phase crystalline packings are in competition with icosahedral packings , and that polydispersity acts in favor of the latter ones .",

    "our aim is to compare the behavior of both two - point quantities and many - body quantities with increasing pressure . due to the hard - sphere interaction ,",

    "@xcite we averaged on times comparable or longer than the @xmath12 relaxation , leading to a quantity that was trivially a reflection of the dynamical heterogeneity .",

    "more rigorously , one can compute directly the free - energy of each configuration by measuring the free volume of the particles , defined as the volume ( @xmath16 ) in which each sphere can freely move while holding all the other spheres fixed .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that this free volume is simply related to the pair free - energy ( @xmath17 ) by the following relation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the thermal de broglie wavelength . to compute the free volume",
    "@xmath16 we follow previous studies  @xcite : first the voronoi - diagram for each configuration is computed , and the polyhedron surrounding each particle is determined . to account for polydispersity",
    "we employ the radical voronoi tessellation . the free volume of particle @xmath9 is then computed by shifting normally all the faces of the corresponding polyhedron by @xmath20 toward particle @xmath9 , and computing the new volume . in this way the volume @xmath16 represents the volume in which the excluded volume of particle @xmath9 can move without leaving its voronoi cell .",
    "this procedure is conducted independently for each particle and for each configuration .      to study many - body correlations we use the local bond - order analysis introduced by steinhardt  @xcite ,",
    "first applied to study crystal nucleation by frenkel and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21-fold symmetry of a neighborhood around each particle @xmath9 is characterized by a @xmath22 dimensional complex vector ( @xmath23 ) as @xmath24 , where @xmath21 is a free integer parameter , and @xmath25 is an integer that runs from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "the functions @xmath28 are the spherical harmonics and @xmath29 is the vector from particle @xmath9 to particle @xmath30 .",
    "the sum goes over all neighboring particles @xmath31 of particle @xmath9 .",
    "usually @xmath31 is defined by all particles within a cutoff distance , but in an inhomogeneous system the cutoff distance would have to change according to the local density . instead we sort neighbors according to their distance from particle @xmath9 , and fix @xmath32 which is the number of nearest neighbors in icosahedra and close packed crystals ( like hcp and fcc ) which are known to be the only relevant crystalline structures for hard spheres .    in the analysis , one uses the rotational invariants defined as : @xmath33 where the term in brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wl ] ) is the wigner 3-j symbol .",
    "in particular both crystalline and icosahedral neighborhood have high @xmath34 ( strong 6-fold symmetry ) , with the highest values for the latter . to detect specifically icosahedral order one prefers @xmath35 ,",
    "whose minimum value is obtained only by a perfect icosahedron .",
    "the identification of crystalline particles follows the usual procedure  @xcite .",
    "a particle is identified as crystal if its orientational order is coherent ( in symmetry and in orientation ) with that of its neighbors .",
    "the scalar product @xmath36 quantifies this similarity .",
    "if it exceeds @xmath37 between two neighbors , they are deemed _",
    "connected_. we then identify a particle as crystalline if it is connected with at least @xmath38 neighbors  @xcite . in a more continuous way , summing the contribution of all the bonds of a given particle",
    ", we define the `` crystallinity ''  @xcite @xmath39    alternatively , one can coarse - grain @xmath40 over the neighbors  @xcite @xmath41 to suppress the signal from locally incoherent orientations ( icosahedral order )  @xcite and use the resulting invariant @xmath42 as an indication of crystallinity , more precisely , the degree of crystal - like rotational symmetry .",
    "alternatively , we note that the shortcomings of non - coarse - grained order parameters in the identification of crystallinity can be addressed by minkowski tensors  @xcite .    here",
    "we briefly consider the physical meaning of crystal - like bond orientational order parameters .",
    "the crystallization transition is characterized by the symmetry breaking of both orientational and translational order .",
    "we note that both @xmath43 and @xmath42 are good measures of bond orientational order , whereas the density or other two - body quantities are measures of translational order .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that in hard spheres crystallization is driven by fluctuations in bond orientational order and not by density fluctuations .",
    "crystals continuously form , grow and melt in regions of high bond orientational order , which then effectively act as precursors for the crystallization transition .",
    "so @xmath43 and @xmath42 , while not being direct indicators for the presence of crystals , rather measure the tendency to promote crystallization . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lengths ] we are going to show that indeed the lengthscale associated with bond orientational order fluctuations increases with supercooling . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : icosahedra ] we are going to study the mechanism by which the crystallization transition is avoided .      finally we explain how to evaluate the correlation length of various order parameters .",
    "the calculation can be carried out both in real space and in fourier space . while formally containing the same information , the fourier analysis has some practical advantages over the real space analysis . in real space ,",
    "the correlation function of any order parameter is a oscillating and rapidly decaying function of @xmath44 .",
    "the correlation length is obtained by fitting the _ envelope _ of the correlation function with a ornstein - zernike expression .",
    "this expresion is only asymptotic , so the two first peaks at short @xmath44 should be omitted , and it is also rapidly decaying , so that the statistical noise strongly affects the quality of the fit at long @xmath44 .",
    "the problem is less severe for order parameters having a tensorial nature , and correlation lengths of crystal - like bond orientational order have been easily measured in real space in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "for example , the tensorial order parameter @xmath45 effectively correlates 7 scalar fields , allowing a sevenfold reduction of the noise .",
    "but the real space analysis requires much longer time averages for two - body correlation functions , both @xmath17 and @xmath8 , which have a purely scalar nature .",
    "this problem can be overcome by calculating the correlation functions in fourier space .",
    "these function are not oscillatory at small @xmath46 where we can expect a ornstein - zernike form , and thus much easier to fit unambiguously .",
    "so , to keep both two - body and many - body correlation functions consistent , we calculate all correlations in fourier space .",
    "we explain in the following a straightforward procedure to extract correlation length from fourier space analysis .    at a given time step , for any scalar order parameter field",
    "@xmath47 increasing with order , we compute a structure factor keeping only the 10% most ordered particles ( more on this choice below ) .",
    "this condition defines a threshold @xmath48 .",

    "but at @xmath97 a crossover occurs and the crystal phase gains microscopic stability : a particle in a crystalline environment will have higher orientational order than a particle in the fluid phase at the same volume fraction .",
    "this crossover marks the appearance in the fluid phase of the metastable crystals which continuously appear , grow and shrink , until eventually a crystal droplet reaches the critical size and starts the crystallization process . at a higher volume fraction ( @xmath98 )",
    "another crossover occurs , with crystalline particles having less orientational order than particles in the `` fluid '' branch .",
    "these particles in the fluid phase at high @xmath34 are easily identified as particles in icosahedral packings ( they have a low value of @xmath35 ) .",
    "it is thus clear that icosahedral packings are competing with crystalline packings , eventually dominating at high @xmath92 .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by looking at the polydisperse case ( blue dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : stability_map ] ) . at polydispersity",
    "@xmath94 the crystalline branch always lays above the fluid one , meaning that crystalline environments , at any fixed @xmath92 , are not able to attain higher bond orientational order than other configurations .",
    "microscopically the difference between the monodisperse and the polydisperse case is due to an increased population of icosahedral particles , which dominate the fluid branch for @xmath99 .",
    "we have shown that , while for the monodisperse case there is a range of volume fractions where crystalline particles attain higher orientational order than icosahedral arrangements , for the polydisperse case icosahedral particles always attain higher orientational order .",
    "this is immediately reflected in direct simulations , as at this pressure it is not possible to crystallize simulations at @xmath94 , while the monodisperse simulations are easily crystallized  @xcite .",
    "since the diffusional dynamics of the system , which controls the kinetic factor of crystallization @xcite , is approximately the same at different values of @xmath59  @xcite , this difference in the crystallization behavior has to come from some structural difference introduced by polydispersity , i.e. an increased population of icosahedral particles ( see figs . [",
    "fig : polydispersity ] and [ fig : cmaps ] ) .",
    "we also confirm that at polydispersity @xmath63 icosahedral particles are favored over crystalline ones for all the pressures studied , in line with the observation of fasolo and sollich  @xcite that one - phase crystallization is suppressed at high polydispersity .",
    "we have thus provided direct evidence that icosahedral particles are responsible for the suppression of crystallization in polydisperse hard spheres .",
    "in the present study we have compared the evolution of static length scales in polydisperse hard spheres for both two - body and many - body correlation functions .",
    "while two - body correlation functions do not show any sign of an increasing length scale with pressure , we have confirmed that in the glass transition of polydisperse hard spheres the relevant static length is the correlation length of the crystal - like bond order .",
    "we have also determined the relevant microscopic structures that are associated with the increasing lengthscale : they correspond to crystal - like environments of particles and are characterized by slow dynamics .",
    "we thus confirm that in the glass transition of polydisperse hard spheres the relevant static length is the correlation length of the crystal - like bond orientational order .    the other relevant structure with slow dynamics are icosahedral packings of particles , but their lengthscale does not grow appreciably with increasing pressure .",
    "icosahedral assemblies of particles are spatially uncorrelated .",
    "while not having a direct role in the slowing down of the dynamics , we have shown that icosahedral packings are responsible for the avoidance of the crystallization transition with increasing polydispersity .",
    "the increase in polydispersity reduces the degree of crystal - like bond orientational order whereas enhances the icosahedral order ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : polydispersity ] and [ fig : cmaps ] ) .",
    "the former is crucial for triggering crystal nucleation @xcite , whereas the latter leads to the frustration against crystallization , a role that increases with polydispersity .",
    "none of these physical aspects of the system could be described by two - body quantities .",
    "we previously showed that spatial fluctuations of crystal - like bond orientational order are closely correlated with local dynamics : more ordered regions have slower dynamics @xcite . together with these results",
    ", we may say that it is many - body correlations , or crystal - like bond orientational ordering , that are the cause of slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "this means that future theories of glass transition and crystallization should deal with many - body correlation effects properly .",
    "the link between the symmetry of the relevant bond order parameter for describing structural ordering in a supercooled liquid and that for crystallization is another interesting point .",
    "this may be a direct consequence of the fact that glass transition is governed by the same free energy as that controlling crystallization @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is further supported by the role of polydispersity in the glass - forming ability of hard spheres .",
    "the mechanism by which polydispersity increases the barrier for crystal nucleation may be two fold : ( i ) direct random disorder effect which destroys crystal - like bond orientational order in a supercooled liquid , which is the first step in crystal nucleation  @xcite ; ( ii ) enhancement of icosahedral ordering with an increase in the polydispersity .",
    "it is known that size disparity between a particle and its surrounding neighbors stabilizes icosahedral order @xcite .",
    "since the symmetry of icosahedral order is not consistent with that of the equilibrium crystal polymorphs ( fcc and hcp for this case ) , competing ordering toward these two mutually inconsistent symmetries leads to strong frustration effects on crystallization , as in the case of 2d spin liquids  @xcite .",
    "the results shown in fig . [ fig : stability_map ] suggest that mechanism ( ii ) may be more relevant for the suppression of crystallization .",
    "although we studied polydisperse hard spheres in this article , these frustration mechanisms should be relevant to many other glass - forming systems including metallic glass formers  @xcite .",
    "in this article , we show firm evidence for the importance of many - body correlations in glass transition phenomena for hard spheres liquids .",
    "this feature can not be described by the standard liquid - state theories based on two - body correlation .",
    "this implies that , at high density , liquid state packing effects inevitably lead to many - body correlations , which play key roles in phenomena like the glass transition and crystallization .",
    "a physically natural order parameter to pick up these many - body correlations is the _ bond order parameter _ , whose importance has been well recognized and established for ordering transitions of hard disks in 2d @xcite .",
    "we believe in the importance of incorporating many - body correlations into theories to describe both the glass transition and crystallization phenomena properly  @xcite .",
    "our study also indicates that there is an intrinsic link between crystallization and vitrification .",
    "whether a polydisperse hard spheres system is crystallized or vitrified can be controlled just by changing polydispersity , which affects extendable crystal - like bond orientational order and isolated icosahedral order in an opposite manner .",
    "we speculate that this direct link may exist for systems where crystallization does not involve phase separation , in other words , as far as the two phenomena are described by the same free energy @xcite .",
    "how universal is this scenario needs to be checked carefully in the future .",
    "the authors are grateful to daniel bonn for fruitful discussion and drawing our attention to ref .",
