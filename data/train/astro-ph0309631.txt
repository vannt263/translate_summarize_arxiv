    "the photoionization , recombination and collisions can be considered as relevant processes in broad line region ( blr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . at larger ionization parameters",
    "recombination is more important , but at the higher temperatures the collisional excitation also becomes important , as well as in the case of low ionization parameters .",
    "these two effects , as well as radiative - transfer effects in balmer lines should be taken into account to explain the ratios of hydrogen lines ( osterbrock 1989 , krolik 1999 ) .",
    "different physical conditions and processes can be assumed in order to use the emission lines for diagnostic of emission plasma ( osterbrock 1989 , griem 1997 , ferland et al .",
    "although `` in many aspects the blrs are physically as closely related to stellar atmospheres as traditional nebula '' ( osterbrock 1989 ) , the plasma in the blr probably does not come close to being in complete local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) . however , there may still be the partial local thermodynamical equilibrium ( plte ) in the sense that populations of sufficiently highly excited levels are related to the next ion s ground state population by saha - boltzmann relations ( van der mullen et al .",
    "1994 ) , or to the total population in all fine - structure levels of the ground - state configuration ( see e.g. griem 1997 ) .",
    "the plte for different types of plasma : ionizing , recombining plasma and plasma in ionization balance were discussed in fujimoto & mcwhirter ( 1990 ) .",
    "they found that the populations of higher - lying levels are well described by the saha - boltzmann equation .",
    "recently , popovi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the balmer lines of ngc 3516 indicate that the balmer emitting line region may be in the plte .",
    "here we present a part of the results that will be given in more details in popovi ( 2003 ) concerning the test of the plte existence in blr of agns using the boltzmann - plot ( bpt ) of balmer lines .",
    "we discuss the possibility of estimation of the relevant physical processes and plasma parameters in blrs using this method .",
    "if the plasma is in plte , the population of the parent energy states adhere to a boltzmann distribution uniquely characterized by their excitation temperature ( @xmath3 ) , and this temperature may be obtained from a boltzmann - plot when the transitions within the same spectral series are considered ( for more details see konjevi 1999 , popovi 2003 )    @xmath4 where @xmath5 is relative intensity of transition from upper to lower level ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants , where @xmath8 indicates temperature and we will call it the temperature parameter .",
    "if we can approximate the @xmath9 as a linear decreasing function of @xmath10 then : a ) it indicates that plte may exist at least to some extent in the blr ; b ) if plte is present , the population adhering to a boltzmann distribution is uniquely characterized by its excitation temperature .",
    "then we can estimate the electron temperature from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant ; c ) if plte is present we can roughly estimate the minimal electron density in blr . here , we should mention that `` case b '' recombination of balmer lines can bring the @xmath9 _ vs _ @xmath10 as linear decreasing function ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "but , regarding the physical conditions ( electron densities and temperatures ) in blrs in this case the constant a is too small ( @xmath13 ) and the boltzmann - plot can not be applied for diagnostics of electron temperature even if plte exists ( see discussion in popovi 2003 ) . moreover , in this case boltzmann - plot method can be used as an indicator of `` case b '' recombination in blr of some agns .",
    "in order to test the existence of plte in blr , we use hst observations obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and faint object spectrograph ( fos ) , covering the wavelength ranges 2900 - 5700   and 6295 - 6867    ( rest wavelength ) . from the very large data base of agn spectra at hst archive we selected the objects using following selection criteria :",
    "a ) the observation covered the balmer series line wavelength region ; b ) the observations were performed on the same day ; c ) all the lines from balmer series can be recognized and all have relatively well defined shapes ; d ) we considered only low red - shifted objects .    to perform a test we subtracted the narrow and satellite lines from balmer lines . to estimate the contribution of these lines we used a multi - gaussian analysis ( e.g. see popovi et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "we fit each line with a sum of gaussian components using a @xmath14 minimalization routine .    on the other hand , the reddening effect can influence the balmer lines ratio ( see e.g. crenshaw et al . 2001 , 2002 , and references therein ) and consequently on temperature parameter obtained by boltzmann - plot . here",
    "the galactic reddening was taken into account using the data from nasa s extragalacitc database ( ned ) . in order to test the total ( galactic + intrinsic ) reddening influence we have considered the case of akn 564 , where the reddening data are given by crenshaw et al .",
    "we estimated that the reddening effect can contribute to the boltzmann - plot slope around of 30%-40% ( in the case of akn 564 around of 35% , @xmath15 ) , but this effect can not qualitatively disturb the straight line as a function in boltzmann - plot . the reddening effect will always cause that temperatures measured by this method will give smaller values if this effect is not taken into account . in the rest of our sample",
    "we did not consider the intrinsic reddening effect .",

    "the more detailed discussion of the obtained results is given in popovi ( 2003 ) , here we will give the basic conclusion .",
    "\\1 ) that from the 14 selected agns , in 9 agns boltzmann - plot indicates the existence of plte in blr , while in the case of 4 of them the boltzmann - plot indicates `` case b '' recombination in blr . in remaining 1",
    "agn the boltzmann - plot can not be applied ( see fig . 1 , left )",
    ".    \\2 ) the estimated blr electron temperatures using boltzmann - plot where plte exists are in a range ( 1.3 - 3.7)@xmath16 k ( within 30% accuracy ) .",
    "they are in a good agreement with the previous estimations .          on the other hand , as one can see in fig . 1 right , the electron temperatures estimated by using boltzmann - plot tend to be velocity dependent as a linear decreasing function of random velocities measured at full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) as well as full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) .",
    "the boltzmann - plot method is very useful for probing of the physical properties of blrs where plte exist . on the other side , although the alternative of plte indicated by the boltzmann - plot method may be considered ( e.g. case b recombination + high intrinsic reddening effect ) , the method may be used for fast insight into physical processes in blr of agns prior applying more sophisticated blr physical models .",
