    "our graphene flakes are made by mechanically exfoliating natural graphite onto degenerately doped si substrate with an oxide thickess of @xmath1300 nm . we identified monolayer flakes by their optical contrast and confirmed the thickness by measuring quantum hall plateaus in a two - terminal configuration .",
    "two- and three - terminal differential conductance measurements were taken using standard low frequency ac lock - in techniques , and a voltage @xmath2 applied to the doped si substrate controlled the carrier density . to enable charge writing we spin coated a 100 nm thick layer of pmma over the device .",

    "all measurements presented were carried out at a temperature of @xmath14.2 k.          to estimate the distribution of the deposited charge , the kpm and back - gate sweep measurements are simultaneously compared with their respective models , and a search process is used to iteratively approach the solution closest to the experimental results .",
    "the charge is first considered uniformly distributed in a rectangular volume , with the charge density and the dimensions of this volume left as free parameters .",
    "an error minimization process estimates the charge distribution related parameters .",
    "firstly the length and the depth of the rectangle are initialised and the charge density is determined .",
    "then , for the set of tip heights above the sample for which kpm measurements are available , the kpm line sections are simulated by solving the two - dimensional laplace equation using matlab . with the same initial parameters , the back - gate sweep , given the induced carrier density , is modelled using the method presented in ref .",
    "the discrepancy between the measured and simulated data define an error measure and minimizing this measure over a set of parameters leads to the best fits in fig .",
    "s  [ fig : figs1 ] .      in order to numerically study the properties of the device for a large range of potential landscapes , gate voltages and probe positions ,",
    "we have adopted a simplified simulation approach , replacing a more exact , but time - consuming , self - consistent calculation with an approximate calculation of the potential profile within the device  @xcite , which is then passed on to an envelope - function based code for transport simulation  @xcite .",
    "we start from the knowledge of the potential profile @xmath58 in the graphene layer for a particular set of voltages @xmath59 applied to the gates  @xcite . when the gate voltages are changed by @xmath60 , a variation @xmath61 results in the potential profile ( with respect to @xmath58 ) , as well as a variation @xmath62 in the charge density ( with respect to the charge density @xmath63 corresponding to the profile @xmath58 ) .",
    "if the electrostatic coupling is modeled through the capacitances @xmath64 ( per unit area ) between the gates and the flake , such variations are related by @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is the modulus of the electron charge ) .",
    "on the other hand , the charge density @xmath67 is directly related to the number of occupied states , and thus to the local density of states . while the exact local density of states depends on the wave function in the device and thus on the solution of the transport problem , in the hypothesis of slow - varying potential it can be approximated by shifting the argument of the density of states by the local value of the potential energy . under the further hypotheses of low temperature ( fermi - dirac distribution approaching a step function ) , of quasi equilibrium ( fermi energy of the contacts nearly identical , equal to @xmath68 ) , and of a sufficiently large graphene flake ( density of states approaching that of unconfined graphene ) , the charge density can be expressed as @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ electrostatics ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ charge ] ) , a second - order equation is obtained , which can be analytically solved in order to find the quantity @xmath61 and thus the profile @xmath70 . since in general the quantities @xmath72 , @xmath58 , @xmath61 , @xmath67 , @xmath63 , @xmath62 , and @xmath64 are spatially - varying , the calculation has to be repeated for each point of the graphene flake .",
    "then , the resulting approximate potential profile is passed on to the code for transport simulation  @xcite .",
    "the structure is partitioned into a series of thin cascaded sections , in such a way that within each section the potential can be assumed as approximately constant along the transport direction . as a consequence , in each of these regions",
    "the envelope functions of graphene can be written as a confined transverse component multiplied by a longitudinally propagating plane wave .",
    "after some analytical manipulations , the resulting dirac equation with dirichlet boundary conditions is recast into a differential equation with periodic boundary conditions , that can be efficiently solved in the reciprocal space  @xcite . then we enforce the continuity of the wave function at each interface between adjacent sections , on each of the two graphene sublattices and for all the possible modes impinging on the interface . projecting these continuity equations on a basis of transverse functions , and solving the resulting linear system ,",
    "the scattering matrix connecting the modes at the two sides of the interface is obtained .",
    "recursively composing all the scattering matrices and applying the landauer - bttiker formula , we obtain the conductance of the overall structure .    with this approach , we have first simulated the transport behavior of the graphene flake considering the effect of the back - gate , coupled to the sample through a 0.1151  mf/(m@xmath56 ) capacitance , and assuming a smooth cavity - shaped potential @xmath58 with different profiles and widths . comparing the resistance behavior , and in particular the fabry - prot resonances resulting from the numerical simulations and from the experimental measurements ( see fig",

    "in particular , we have considered several longitudinal potential walls with a height corresponding to about 10% of the total depth of the cavity , that partition it into subcavities in parallel with an average width of 400  nm ( see the potential profile shown in fig .  s  [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "a finite dispersion is introduced in the values of the potential at the bottom and of the width of the subcavities , as well as in the height of the walls separating the cavities .",
    "the resulting behavior of the resistance as a function of the back - gate voltage is reported with a dashed curve in fig .",
    "s  [ fig1](b ) , for a small range of @xmath2 values .",
    "even though the disorder in the potential landscape introduces irregularities in the resistance behavior , the fabry - prot oscillations typical of the original profile are still clearly visible .",
    "we have then included the effect of electric field focusing at the edges , obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ charge ] ) with the complete poisson equation for a set of reference configurations and parametrizing the results as a function of the back - gate voltage . for the resulting potential profile ,",
    "we have first repeated the calculation of the resistance as a function of the back - gate voltage .",

    "s  [ fig1](b ) , and are characterized by smaller and more rapid oscillations ( similar to those observed in the experiments ) , superimposed to the fabry - prot resonances already observed when the electric field focusing at the edges is neglected .",
    "then , for this profile , we have performed a simulation of the resistance variation as the probe ( located at a distance of 50  nm from the 100  nm thick dielectric coating and biased with a voltage @xmath74 - 10  v ) is scanned over the whole device .",
    "to this end , we have included into eq .",

    "2(c ) : multiple halos appear , analogous to those observed in the experimental data ( see the upper panel of fig .  2(c ) ) . these halos in the bulk of the flake",
    "originate from the formation of the subcavities and , indeed , disappear if the scanning probe simulation is performed on a single cavity ( without the separation into several subcavities in parallel ) .",
    "we have then repeated the scanning probe simulation neglecting charge accumulation at the edges of the flake .",
    "the difference between the resistance values obtained with and without the effect of charge accumulation at the edges is shown , for a small subset of probe positions near the edge , in the upper right panel of fig .",
