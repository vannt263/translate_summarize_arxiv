    "future possibilities include programmable machines comparable in size to cells and able to sense and modify their environments",
    ". such microscopic robots could provide significant medical benefits  @xcite with precisely controlled targeted actions at the scale of individual cells .",
    "while microscopic robots can not yet be manufactured , current laboratory demonstrations indicate their likely minimal capabilities based on nanoscale electronics , sensors and motors  @xcite . these capabilities and estimates of the properties of _ in vivo _ environments where the devices would operate are sufficient to develop computational models of device performance for a variety of medical tasks .",
    "these devices utilize stronger materials and faster computation than is possible with biologically - based machines  @xcite .",
    "a particularly important robot environment is the blood vasculature , which allows the robots ready access throughout the body via passive movement with the fluid .",
    "a challenge for computational models of devices in blood is the interactions among the blood components and the devices .",
    "the blood is not a uniform fluid on the scale of the devices but rather consists of larger objects ( the cells ) embedded in a fluid ( the plasma ) .",
    "thus detailed models must include fluid dynamics with cells that move and distort , branching vessels , changes in vessel size , and hydrodynamic interactions among the devices .",
    "of particular interest is the behavior of microscopic devices in capillaries , which exchange chemicals with body tissues and bring the devices close to cells throughout the body .",
    "detailed models including numerous cells interacting with the devices are computationally intensive",
    ". thus design studies of medical task scenarios benefit from simpler models that nevertheless give reasonable quantitative estimates of task performance .",
    "one such model considers the blood as a homogeneous fluid , with possibly modified parameters , at the scale of the robots",
    ". one important process to model is transport of chemicals to the devices , which is similar to the process for bacteria  @xcite .",
    "chemical transport is key for medical tasks such as high - resolution diagnosis  @xcite , treatment through targeted drug delivery  @xcite , microsurgery within and among individual cells  @xcite and power generation using chemicals available in the bloodstream .",
    "an example of power generation in the robots is combining glucose and oxygen in fuel cells analogous to the enzyme - mediated reactions in bacteria  @xcite .",
    "one modeling approximation , suited to vessels wide enough to accommodate multiple cells across their diameter , treats the effect of cells as increasing diffusion in vessels large enough to allow cells to rotate  @xcite . in this case",
    ", a model with homogeneous fluid and an increase in the chemical diffusion coefficients gives a reasonable approximation to chemical transport in the vessel .",
    "however , in capillaries cells move through single file so this approach is not suitable .    as an aid to modeling behavior in capillaries ,",
    "this paper compares a simple model ( homogeneous fluid with no cells ) with the effect of cells moving in the fluid .",
    "the evaluation of behavior with cells is simplified to use realistic but approximate geometry for deformed cell shape based on prior numerical studies of mechanical properties of cells and their membranes .",
    "this approach avoids the computational cost of simultaneously solving for the shape of the cell due to interaction with fluid , while still being useful to calibrate models not including cells .",
    "the models considered here are similar to previous studies of chemical transport in blood vessels  @xcite , but with scenarios relevant for microscopic robots .",
    "in particular , the robots considered here , of size comparable to bacteria , are somewhat smaller than blood and tissue cells , and so can involve steeper concentration gradients . in particular , this model captures two key effects of cells in capillaries : their effect on the fluid flow and their restriction on chemical diffusion within the plasma .",
    "the remainder of the paper describes the cell model and compares its predictions with the simpler homogeneous fluid model .",
    "we examine the effect of cells on microscopic chemical sensors in capillaries by numerically evaluating the fluid flow and chemical diffusion .",
    "we consider a cylindrical vessel  @xcite and an axial - symmetric geometry with the cells centered along the axis of the vessel .",
    "fluid motion in these small vessels is dominated by viscosity : the reynolds number of the flow , i.e. , ratio of inertial to viscous forces , is small : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the fluid density and viscosity , respectively , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are characteristic speed of the flow and size of the vessel and objects in the fluid .",
    "such microfluidic flows are generally smooth and laminar with little mixing  @xcite , leading to physical behaviors distinct from those familiar with macroscopic flows  @xcite .",

    ", oxygen may be used in a fuel cell to power the device and large molecules , such as signaling proteins , are significant for diagnostics .",
    "the diffusion coefficients for such molecules in fluids at body temperature range from @xmath15 for small molecules ( e.g. , oxygen and carbon dioxide ) to around @xmath16 for a typical 10-kilodalton protein  @xcite .",
    "we examine behavior for both these diffusion coefficients and a range of typical flow speeds in capillaries .",
    "table  [ table.parameters ] gives the model parameters for the vessel , fluid properties , cell geometry and chemical diffusion .",
    "unlike the biconcave shape of red blood cells at rest , cells moving through narrow vessels are considerably distorted  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the cells maintain their volume and surface area since their contents are nearly incompressible and the membrane strongly resists changes in area  @xcite .",
    "more complex interactions between cells occur where vessels bend or branch  @xcite .",
    "significantly for chemical transport through the plasma to sensors , the flow establishes a gap between the distorted cell and the vessel wall .",
    "the gap between the cell and vessel wall depends on the speed of the cell in the vessel , as indicated in table  [ table.gap size ] for a vessel of radius @xmath5 . as flow speed increases ,",
    "the gap increases and cells become narrower and longer .",
    ".gap between cell and vessel wall as a function of cell speed , @xmath17 , in a capillary with radius of three microns  @xcite.[table.gap size ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to estimate the effect on chemicals reaching microscopic sensors , we consider an approximate geometry for the cells including most of the distortion from the flow . for a vessel of uniform diameter",
    "far from its merge with other vessels , we consider the cells as achieving their equilibrium shape with respect to the flow and avoid explicitly modeling the forces distorting the cell . with this geometry , we then treat the cells as rigid ( i.e. , assuming the residual forces on the cells are small enough to not give significant further distortion ) , thereby considerably simplifying the subsequent numerical evaluation of fluid flow and chemical diffusion .",

    "chemicals passing through the cell membranes , e.g. , oxygen , give less difference between the two modeling approaches .    in the first scenario ,",
    "appropriate for long term monitoring , the sensor is a group of robots forming a uniform band embedded in the vessel wall .",
    "this band geometry maintains axial symmetry . in this scenario ,",
    "the chemical of interest is in the plasma surrounding the cells in the vessel and is brought past the sensor by the blood flow .",
    "the main performance question is how much of the chemical in the fluid reaches the sensor for capture rather than being driven past the sensor by the fluid flow .",
    "the band of sensors around the vessel wall could consist of multiple rings of devices , but for simplicity we consider the most challenging case for chemical detection : the smallest possible size consistent with axial symmetry of a single device length along the length of the vessel , i.e. , the band has length @xmath34 along the vessel and consists of about @xmath35 individual sensors forming the band around the vessel .",
    "the sensor band has a total surface area of @xmath36 .",
    "such a sensor band could most readily be constructed from a collection of microscopic devices moving through the circulation and aggregating at a suitable location , e.g. , marked by a pattern of chemicals of interest  @xcite . in this way , individual devices could be small enough to flow through even the smallest capillaries and build a larger aggregate structure on the vessel wall .",
    "the process whereby such devices link to each other to form such a structure could employ simple local rules similar to those proposed for larger - scale reconfigurable robots  @xcite .",
    "in the second sensing scenario , we consider a single sensor flowing in the vessel between two cells and the chemical source is a single cell - sized region on the vessel wall . in this case",
    "we take the sensor to be spherical with diameter @xmath34 , and moving in the center of the vessel , thereby maintaining axial symmetry .",
    "the specific choice of positioning of the sensor , half - way between the two cells , can be viewed either as an approximation of where it would be moved by the fluid , or as the device having active locomotion to maintain this position with respect to the cells .",
    "this model assumes the presence of the sensor makes negligible changes in the shape or positioning of the nearby cells .",
    "this scenario corresponds to robots patrolling the circulation for chemical events of interest .",
    "thus the performance measure is not only how much chemical the sensor detects but also how much it detects while close to the source .",
    "that is , the patrolling function can involve not only detecting the existence of a chemical source but also locating it for possible subsequent operations , such as moving to the source location  @xcite and releasing drugs at this location  @xcite . to maintain axial symmetry",
    ", we take the source region to be a band around the vessel of length @xmath37 , i.e. , about as large as a single cell wrapped around the vessel , thereby testing how quickly the passing sensor can detect the fairly steep concentration gradient produced by chemicals released by a single cell .",
    "we take the chemical flux to be uniform throughout this band .    for specific numerical values of the rate at which the sensors absorb molecules we need values for the inlet concentration @xmath38 and source flux @xmath39 in the first and second scenarios , respectively .",
    "the concentration throughout the vessel and flux to the sensor are linear in these values .",
    "thus the relative comparison between models with and without cells does not depend on the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , for definiteness , we choose specific values , given in table  [ table.sensor scenarios ] , corresponding to a typical high - resolution diagnostic task .",
    "other situations , with either higher or lower concentrations , simply proportionally change the sensor flux values reported below .",
    "the amount of a chemical in a milliliter of blood plasma relevant for medical diagnostics range from picograms for some proteins to milligrams ( e.g. , for glucose )  @xcite .",
    "high resolution diagnostics for which microscopic robots would be useful involve the lower concentrations , in particular with robots passing close to the sources of rare chemicals where the local concentrations will be considerably larger than these measured values in blood samples , which correspond to the chemical diluted throughout the blood volume .",
    "for example , suppose a small source released a chemical into a few nearby capillaries giving local concentration @xmath38 near the source .",
    "after mixing throughout the full @xmath40-liter blood volume of an adult , a concentration @xmath38 in a typical capillary , of length about a millimeter , dilutes by about a factor of @xmath41 . as a definite value for the first scenario , we consider a 10-kilodalton protein with concentration @xmath42 , which corresponds to @xmath31",
    ". a corresponding flux from a single cell producing this concentration in a nearby capillary is around @xmath43 , which gives a challenging diagnostic task  @xcite .",
    "for a cell with surface area @xmath44 , this value corresponds to producing @xmath45 , or @xmath46 , through the cell membrane .",
    "we use these example values for the two scenarios , summarized in table  [ table.sensor scenarios ] .      with the specified geometry of cells and sensors ,",
    "we solve the partial differential equations for fluid flow and chemical transport numerically using the finite element method  @xcite . for numerical solution we model a segment of the vessel , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.spacing ] except using 10 and 20 cells in the models for the first and second scenario , respectively . in the first scenario ,",
    "the model also includes the spherical sensor half - way between the middle two cells .",
    "the navier - stokes equation governs the fluid flow  @xcite . for a periodic array of cells shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.spacing ] we specify the speed @xmath17 at which the cells move through the vessel .",
    "a convenient numerical method is using a frame of reference moving with the cells  @xcite , analogous to the view from a camera moving at speed @xmath17 . in this moving reference frame ,",
    "the cells are stationary while the vessel wall moves backwards .",
    "this means the fluid flow does not change with time and we compute a steady - state solution for the flow throughout the vessel in the moving reference frame .",
    "the fluid boundary conditions are zero velocity ( `` no slip '' ) on the boundaries of the cells and moving backwards with speed @xmath47 along the vessel wall . as part of the numerical solution , we find the pressure difference giving no net force on the cell in the center of the modeled vessel region .",
    "this pressure difference corresponds to the fluid pushing the cells through the vessel with a steady speed @xmath17 .    for chemicals in the fluid",
    ", the concentration @xmath48 is governed by the diffusion equation  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the chemical flux , i.e. , the rate at which molecules pass through a unit area , and @xmath51 is the fluid velocity vector determined from the solution of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the first term in the flux is diffusion , which acts to reduce concentration gradients , and the second term is motion of the chemical due to the movement of the fluid in which the chemical is dissolved .",
    "chemical reactions that create or destroy the chemical in the fluid give additional terms in the diffusion equation .    as boundary conditions for the diffusion equation ,",
    "we take the cells and vessel wall to be insulating , i.e. , no chemical crosses those boundaries . sufficiently far from the sensor",
    ", diffusion makes the concentration uniform throughout the vessel . in our case , far upstream from the sensor we have a known concentration at the inlet to the modeled vessel segment , described below for the two scenarios .",
    "far downstream , the concentration is again uniform but its value depends on how much of the chemical is absorbed by the sensor .",
    "thus the downstream concentration is not known a priori , and we use instead a convective boundary condition at the outlet , i.e. , taking @xmath52 , corresponding to a uniform concentration throughout the vessel far downstream of the sensor .    the boundary conditions for the vessel inlet and the sensor depend on the scenario , as does the initial condition for concentration in the vessel .",
    "a natural boundary condition for the sensor is zero concentration , corresponding to a completely absorbing sensor .",
    "this gives the maximum rate the sensor could detect chemicals and is suitable for low concentration conditions where the sensor is diffusion - limited  @xcite .",
    "this will generally be the situation for applications : detecting chemicals with low concentrations and localized in small volumes which can not be readily detected in simpler laboratory procedures , e.g. , from a blood sample .",
    "alternatively , the sensor could have active pumps to collect chemicals  @xcite , thereby maintaining near - zero concentrations even at higher flux rates .",
    "in the first scenario , we suppose a chemical is released into the vessel well upstream of the sensor band . eventually the fluid brings the chemical past the sensor band , which absorbs some of the chemical .",
    "we model this situation as initially zero concentration in the vessel and a constant concentration @xmath38 at the inlet .    instead of a zero concentration boundary condition for the sensor , with the sensor band moving backwards with the wall and a zero flux condition on the rest of the wall ,",
    "a simpler numerical approach is a time - dependent flux boundary condition for the entire wall .",
    "that is , at time @xmath53 , when the sensor has moved a distance @xmath54 from its initial location on the wall , we take flux to be @xmath55 along the sensor and zero elsewhere on the wall , smoothed over a short distance , @xmath56 , to avoid discontinuity in the numerical solution .",
    "we pick @xmath57 large enough so the concentration along the sensor is very small , but not so large as to introduce numerical instabilities . in our case",
    ", @xmath58 is sufficient to make the concentration at the sensor less than @xmath59 where @xmath38 is the inlet concentration .",
    "thus this procedure approximately models a fully absorbing sensor .",
    "we start with zero concentration in the vessel and solve in time until the flux reaching the vessel outlet stabilizes . at this point",
    "the flux reaching the sensor becomes periodic in time , with no change after a shift of one cell spacing , i.e. , distance @xmath27 , past the sensor .    in the reference frame fixed on the cells , the sensor band moves backwards at speed @xmath17 which would eventually cause the band to move outside the segment of the vessel included in the model .",
    "to allow solving over long times , we can exploit the periodic nature of the fluid flow .",
    "specifically , we solve incrementally over a time @xmath60 where a given location on the wall moves past one cell and then shift the solution by a distance @xmath27 to place the absorber back in the center of the solution domain and repeat .",
    "this procedure keeps the region of interest on the wall , i.e. , the absorbing band , near the center of the model domain .    in the second scenario ,",
    "we take the chemical source band on the vessel wall to produce the chemical with a uniform flux @xmath39 .",
    "we solve this model in the reference frame moving with the cells , so the source on the wall moves backwards past the cells and sensor . as described above , we model this with a time - dependent boundary condition with flux @xmath39 at the location of the source and zero elsewhere on the vessel wall , smoothed over a short distance , @xmath56 .",
    "the inlet has zero concentration .    for the initial concentration , when the source is well downstream of the absorbing sensor , all the chemical released by the source",
    "is swept downstream .",
    "thus the concentration upstream of the source is zero and downstream the flow must have the entire production of the source .",
    "the source produces chemical at a rate @xmath61 .",
    "if the concentration far downstream is @xmath38 , all of which is in the plasma , which occupies volume fraction @xmath62 of the vessel , then the fluid moves chemical at a rate @xmath63 . equating these expressions gives the initial downstream concentration of @xmath64 . in the simpler model without cells ,",
    "the plasma fills the whole vessel so @xmath65 in this expression for the downstream concentration in that case . as initial condition",
    ", we take a smooth transition , over a distance of @xmath66 , between 0 and this value of @xmath38 at the initial location of the source .",
    "we start the numerical solution with the source well downstream of the sensor , so the precise form of this initial concentration has little effect on the behavior of the sensor by the time it passes the source .",
    "we compare the sensor performance in the two scenarios for the models with and without cells using the parameters of table  [ table.parameters ] .",
    "the numerical solutions give the rate the sensors absorb the chemical .",
    "for the evenly spaced cells with identical geometry considered here , the fluid flow is independent of time and periodic , with period @xmath27 , along the length of the vessel . in the reference frame moving with the cells , the fluid circulates between the cells , moving away from the front of the cell along the vessel axis and toward the front of the cell near the vessel wall .      in the first scenario ,",

    "this is an upper bound on the _ steady - state _ flux to the sensor , i.e. , if the sensor captures all the chemical produced by the source .",
    "the actual values of table  [ table.results : sphere ] are well below this rate , except for short periods of time with the lower speeds and high diffusion coefficient .    as another comparison , eq .",
    "( [ eq.absorb ] ) gives the flux to a sphere of radius @xmath134 for a chemical with diffusion coefficient @xmath70 and concentration far from the sphere equal to the initial downstream concentration for @xmath69 as @xmath135 .",
    "in summary , for the two sensing scenarios examined , the simpler model of a vessel without cells gives similar performance estimates as the model with the cells .",
    "thus neither the change in fluid flow nor confinement of the chemical significantly alter sensor performance .",
    "thus the simpler model is sufficient for design studies of microscopic chemical sensors operating within capillaries .",
    "such studies are relevant both for diagnostics , where the devices attempt to detect specific chemicals , and for power generation where the devices use chemicals in blood plasma as a power source .",
    "on the other hand , the model with the cells identifies additional aspects of the robots environment related to the nearby cells .",
    "in particular , the variation in the results show the sensor band on the vessel wall could estimate the rate of passing cells from variations in the counts as well as changes in the fluid shear on devices equipped with flow sensors  @xcite . from such measurements , the devices could estimate the local hematocrit of the vessel .",
    "the model considers red blood cells of uniform size and spacing .",
    "this approach ignores other components of blood , particularly the smaller platelets and the much larger white blood cells , which are much less common than red cells , variation in size and spacing of the red cells , changes in vessel diameter and effects on the flow at branching vessels .    as a caveat in interpreting these results , this model is a continuum approximation to a discrete process of individual molecule detections . for macroscopic systems ,",
    "the number of molecules involved is so large that this approximation accurately represents the detection rates .",
    "however , for microscopic sensors , and particularly at low concentrations , the number of molecules involved is relatively small and statistical fluctuations in the actual count become significant ( even assuming the sensor itself makes no errors in capturing or identifying the molecules that reach it via diffusion ) .",
    "the continuum approximation gives the average rate of a poisson process for the counts , with fluctuations proportional to the square root of the number .",
    "these fluctuations are a significant source of noise for microscopic sensors , and limit their ability to discriminate chemical sources of interest from background concentration from other sources  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we consider the chemical as arising only from the source of interest . in practice , there will be background concentrations of the chemical and the sensing task will need to distinguish high concentrations over small distances from a lower but pervasive background concentration .",
    "thus the detection algorithm used by the sensors must handle statistical fluctuations from the background concentration occasionally appearing to indicate a high localized concentration  @xcite . for comparing the models with and without cells ,",
    "such background concentration is simple to include in the plasma and gives a proportionate increase in the detected flux .",
    "extensions of this model of microscopic devices interacting with cells in capillaries could address other scenarios .",
    "examples include chemicals released by the red blood cells ( such as oxygen ) , branching and changes in size of vessel in which the numerical method must include changes to cell shape  @xcite and forces on the cells .",
    "the last case is relevant for safety by evaluating whether the force groups of sensors impose on passing cells could damage the cells .",
    "the model is also relevant for drug delivery tasks targeted to the bloodstream or its components , and could include diffusion of these chemicals out of the capillary to surrounding tissues  @xcite .",
    "another scenario is the detection of a transient chemical source rather than a steady - state sources considered here . in this case",
    ", the time history of the transient may be of interest .",
    "the model including cells could determine how cells in the fluid alter that history as observed by the sensor as an additional check on the adequacy of the simpler model without cells .",
    "more generally , this work illustrates how models originally developed to study transport properties in small vessels extend to engineering design studies of the behaviors and environments of microscopic robots . by characterizing chemical detection rates and locations ,",
    "these models provide constraints on the performance of individual devices and suggestions for control strategies to enable robust , rapid task performance of medical tasks by large groups of robots .",
