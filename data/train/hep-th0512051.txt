    "there is a finite number of distinct two - dimensional toroidal orbifolds , classified by the crystallographic space groups of the plane @xcite .",
    "an orbifold by a discrete group of order greater than two can only be realized if the torus is defined by either a square or a hexagonal lattice .",
    "the basic examples are @xmath0 ( square lattice ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( hexagonal lattice ) . as string backgrounds ,",
    "these are rigid : since it is not possible to deform the shape of the torus ( complex structure ) without breaking the discrete symmetry that is gauged , such deformations are not part of the moduli space . as a consequence of this fact , mirror symmetry relates these toroidal orbifolds to nongeometric backgrounds , that can be described as asymmetric orbifolds - just applying t - duality - or more interestingly as landau - ginzburg models ( see for example @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we will specialize to the @xmath0 orbifold , but the general discussion applies to the other cases as well .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the @xmath0 orbifold at the self - dual radius is equivalent , at the level of the worldsheet cft s , to the tensor product of minimal models @xmath3 .",
    "this cft has also a description as a landau - ginzburg model with superpotential @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "using the landau - ginzburg description one can extend the equivalence to the full moduli space of the two models , identifying polynomial deformations of the lg superpotential with the khler deformations of the orbifold .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend this correspondence to the open string sector and in particular to use the mirror description to study d - branes extended in the @xmath0 orbifold .    in the past two years",
    "there has been much progress in working with branes in landau - ginzburg models @xcite , in the framework of matrix factorizations .",
    "this approach was first proposed by m. kontsevich and was later introduced in the physics literature in @xcite . for the lg models that describe ( orbifolds of ) tensor products of @xmath5 minimal models @xcite , a useful correspondence has been established between lg matrix factorizations and boundary states @xcite .",
    "it has also been possible in certain cases to give a geometric interpretation to the lg branes , either by moving to a different point in moduli space @xcite or via mirror symmetry @xcite .    in the landau - ginzburg setup",
    "it is natural to look for a set of fundamental branes , such that all other branes in the model ( more precisely we will be considering branes that preserve b - type worldsheet supersymmetry ) can be constructed as bound state of these . combining the information obtained from the lg analysis with the known results for boundary states in minimal models ( especially @xcite ) - and the relation between the two - we are able to give a geometric interpretation to this set of branes as d1-branes constrained to pass through any two of the orbifold fixed points , much like fractional branes .",
    "this provides a very explicit example of mirror symmetry , in addition to allowing us to learn more about the properties of branes that are interesting in their own right .",
    "as mentioned above , a similar analysis could be repeated for other models .",
    "in addition to the main examples of @xmath6 orbifolds , for which the equivalence to tensor products of minimal models is described very explicitly in @xcite , one can consider modding out these by various ( quantum ) discrete symmetries , completing the list of @xmath7 orbifolds .",
    "these models will have a description as landau - ginzburg orbifolds .",
    "higher dimensional toroidal orbifolds can also be constructed from these basic building blocks .",
    "for example , it is very easy to generalize the computations of this paper to the spacetime supersymmetric @xmath8 orbifold limit of @xmath9 ; it would be interesting to study the open string theory on the branes extended in the orbifold directions for this case @xcite .",
    "also , for non - supersymmetric backgrounds ( such as the one considered in this paper ) , studying the dynamics of branes extended in the orbifold might shed some light on the evolution of the compact spacetime under closed string tachyon condensation , following the line of reasoning of @xcite .",
    "we expect that the interplay between landau - ginzburg and cft techniques could prove useful in analysing all these diverse models .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section [ cft ] is a review of the equivalence between the @xmath0 orbifold and the tensor product of minimal models @xmath3 , rewritten from the point of view of mirror symmetry .",
    "the remaining sections contain an analysis of the branes in these models . in section [ lgbranes ] the formalism of matrix factorizations is used to give a partial classification of b - branes in the landau - ginzburg model that describes the @xmath10 cft . from this analysis",
    "we derive some properties of the branes that are used , in section [ abranes ] , to give a geometric interpretation of the lg branes as d1-branes on @xmath11 .",
    "the arguments given in this section are based on spacetime intuition and are not sufficient to give a full description of the branes as boundary states . in order to do that ,",
    "in section [ mmbs ] we make contact with the description of the same branes as minimal model boundary states .",
    "this analysis is more rigorous and allows us to obtain the full boundary state description of the a - branes on @xmath11 , complementing the more heuristic ( but more transparent ) discussion of section [ abranes ] .",
    "the details of the map between the @xmath0 and @xmath3 cft s , which are used throughout the paper and especially in section [ mmbs ] , are collected in an appendix .",
    "i would like to thank my advisor , emanuel diaconescu , for suggesting the problem and for his help and suggestions .",

    ". it will also be convenient to introduce complex coordinates @xmath16 . in terms of these",
    "the @xmath17 action is @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , and similarly on the fermions .",
    "it was shown explicitly in @xcite that this model is equivalent to the tensor product of two @xmath5 minimal models of the @xmath20-series , with @xmath21 . in",
    "the conventions that we are following , the minimal model @xmath22 has central charge @xmath23 and has a description as a landau - ginzburg model with superpotential @xmath24 . some facts will be summarized below and further details can be found in the appendix .",
    "this equivalence is in fact mirror symmetry and the goal of this section will be to describe the correspondence between the @xmath25 chiral ring of the orbifold and the @xmath26 chiral ring of the minimal model , in the lg description .",
    "this will be useful later to establish a correspondence between the branes in the two models by comparing their couplings to the bulk fields .",
    "the identification between the @xmath0 orbifold and the @xmath10 conformal field theory is established comparing the superconformal algebra , the spectrum and the ope s of the two theories @xcite .",
    "we adopt the notation @xmath27 for the superconformal algebra of the theory with target space @xmath28 . at the selfdual radius the torus has an enhanced @xmath29 symmetry ( left- and right - moving ) , but",
    "the @xmath17 projection reduces the enhanced symmetry to @xmath30 .",
    "hence the chiral algebra of the @xmath0 orbifold contains , in addition to the currents , the holomorphic @xmath31 current @xmath32\\ ] ] and a corresponding antiholomorphic current @xmath33 .",
    "the chiral algebra of one @xmath34 minimal model can be written in terms of a free fermion ( for general @xmath35 this would be a @xmath36 parafermion ) and a free @xmath31 boson and @xmath26 ring , as in the usual conventions .",
    "this is a consistent choice because the mirror map @xmath37 is an automorphism of the superconformal algebra . ] : @xmath38 the chiral algebra of the tensor product of two minimal models ( restricting attention for the moment to the left - moving sector ) will contain the currents @xmath39 , @xmath40 and two @xmath31 currents @xmath41 .",
    "one can check that the left - moving currents in take this form under the identifications @xmath42 which map the @xmath31 current of the orbifold cft to the current @xmath43 of the @xmath44 theory .",
    "the map for the right - moving currents differs by a sign in the expressions for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 because of the different conventions adopted for the right - moving currents in and . in order to prove that the models are equivalent one also needs to match the primary fields and their ope s and this is done in @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will look only at the spectrum of chiral primaries , since we are interested in comparing the topological observables on the two sides .",
    "more details about the complete map between the primary fields are collected in the appendix .    as a first step",
    "we need a characterization of the twisted sectors of the @xmath0 orbifold @xcite . for the moment",
    "we restrict attention to the bosonic fields .",
    "there are two @xmath17 fixed points , with coordinates @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these correspond to the two conjugacy classes of the space group of translations and order one @xmath17 rotations .",
    "we denote the bosonic part of the twist fields associated with these two fixed points by @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "there are also four @xmath52 fixed points , corresponding to the conjugacy classes of the order two rotations ( reflections ) and translations .",
    "correspondingly , we have four @xmath52 twist fields , denoted by @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the first two are associated with the @xmath17 fixed points at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , while the other two are associated with the fixed points at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are exchanged by the @xmath17 action .",
    "the @xmath17 invariant twist fields are therefore @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    .",
    "]    the twist fields of the full superconformal theory are obtained multiplying by @xmath62 the bosonic twist fields of the @xmath63-th twisted sector .",
    "a convenient basis of operators for the chiral ring ( listed with the respective @xmath64 eigenvalues ) is @xmath65 where we have introduced linear combinations of twist fields in the expression for @xmath66 ( a possible misprint in the reference ) . ] with definite charge with respect to the @xmath31 current : @xmath67 all these chiral primaries are associated with khler deformations of the model : the primary field @xmath68 is a marginal operator associated with the rescaling of the radius of the torus ; all the other primaries are relevant operators , which from the spacetime point of view would be tachyons localized at the orbifold fixed points .",
    "these operators are in one - to - one correspondence with the chiral primaries of the @xmath10 theory . in general , for an @xmath20 minimal model , the primary fields are constructed from the order parameters of the parafermionic system used in the free field representation of the model . in the simple case we are considering the parafermions",
    "are just free fermions and there is only one order parameter , the spin variable @xmath69 of the ising model , with @xmath70 .",
    "the chiral ring is generated by the identity and the operator @xmath71 , which has @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "after tensoring two copies of the model we obtain the following list of chiral primaries : @xmath77 this reproduces the list given above in for @xmath11 , up to the sign of the right - moving @xmath31 charge , so we have a map between the @xmath25 ting of the orbifold cft and the @xmath26 ring on the minimal model side .",
    "the @xmath44 model has a description as a landau - ginzburg model with superpotential @xmath78 and the fields @xmath79 in can be identified with the lowest components of the lg superfields .",
    "the chiral ring of the lg model is @xmath80}{\\partial_1w \\partial_2 w}\\,$ ] , which is the same structure we see in . as usual ,",
    "mirror symmetry maps khler deformation on the a - side to polynomial deformations of the lg superpotential on the b - side .",
    "turning on the marginal deformation @xmath81 , which corresponds to deforming the @xmath0 orbifold away from the selfdual radius point , the relations that define the chiral ring of the lg model become @xmath82 this means that away from the self - dual radius point the mirror model can not be written as the tensor product of two separate rational cft s .",
    "it is interesting to compare the symmetries of the two models .",
    "the lg model is invariant under exchange of the variables @xmath83 and @xmath84 and ( for @xmath85 ) under an independent @xmath17 rotation of the two variables .",
    "these symmetries are also present in the mirror model .",
    "the @xmath86 symmetry is reflected in the cft as invariance under exchange of the two fixed points associated with the twist fields @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this is part of the quantum symmetry , together with a diagonal @xmath17 symmetry acting on the twist fields with weight equal to the order of the twist field : @xmath89 is also a symmetry .",
    "this accounts for the additional @xmath17 symmetry that we observe in the lg model , which at the conformal point is a subgroup of the symmetry generated by the @xmath31 current @xmath90 of @xmath3 . as in",
    ", the @xmath0 fields that map to the@xmath10 ( or landau - ginzburg ) variables are those that have a definite @xmath31 charge .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief comment on the gso projection . as explained in @xcite , the b - branes that we will consider in the next section in the context of the landau - ginzburg model are consistent with the type 0a gso projection in the @xmath91 cft . throughout the paper we will always work with two spacetime dimensions ( from the @xmath0 point of view ) and",
    "the boundary state that we will write in section [ mmbs ] will be consistent with the type 0 projection .",
    "one can of course embed the model in a ten - dimensional string theory , but as it stands the orbifold we are considering will give rise to a nonsupersymmetric spacetime theory .",
    "in this section we look at the brane content of the model introduced in the previous section .",
    "specifically , we are interested in constructing a - branes on @xmath11 , which are expected to be in one - to - one correspondence with the b - branes in the mirror cft .",
    "the problem of constructing and classifying these branes can be approached from at least three different angles : we can study directly the a - type boundary conditions on the @xmath0 orbifold , or we can consider the mirror theory @xmath10 and describe the branes in this non - geometric background .",
    "furthermore , the b - branes in minimal models can be described in terms of boundary states or , in the landau - ginzburg framework , in terms of matrix factorizations of the lg superpotential @xmath92 . in this section",
    "we start from this last point of view and later we will make contact with the other approaches . in particular , we will see in the next sections how to give a geometric interpretation ( on @xmath0 ) to the lg branes constructed below .",
    "the topological b - branes of a landau - ginzburg model are classified by the matrix factorizations of @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "a brane is completely characterized by a matrix @xmath93\\quad \\text{such that } \\quad d^2=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } f\\cdot g & 0\\\\ 0&g\\cdot f \\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } w_{lg}\\cdot{\\relax{\\rm i\\kern-.18em i}}_k & 0\\\\ 0&w_{lg}\\cdot{\\relax{\\rm i\\kern-.18em i}}_k \\end{array}\\right]\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are rank @xmath63 matrices with polynomial entries",
    ". this is a very abstract description , but it can be related to more usual constructions by interpreting the elements of the matrices @xmath94 and @xmath95 as boundary potentials in the lg model defined on a strip . then one can show that the condition that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are a factorization of @xmath96 is equivalent to requiring invariance of the action under b - type supersymmetry @xcite .    in this framework ,",
    "the problem of finding the boundary chiral ring associated with any pair of b - type boundary conditions is translated into an algebraic problem , which only involves the explicit knowledge of the factorizations of @xmath96 associated with the two boundaries .",
    "the boundary observables in the chiral ring are a subset of the open string states of the physical theory and carry some relavant information , such as the number of moduli ( to first order ) of a given brane . given the matrix @xmath97 , one can also easily compute bulk and boundary correlators involving b - model topological observables , which compute certain protected quantities in the physical theory .",
    "for instance , the charges of the b - branes under the ramond - ramond ground states is computed in the topological lg framework by the residue formula @xcite @xmath98}{\\partial_1 w \\partial_2 w}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath99 any of the b - model observables described in the previous section .",
    "here we have written the formula for the case in which @xmath100 is a polynomial in two variables @xmath83 and @xmath101 , which is what we will use , and the overall normalization has been fixed for convenience .    finally , it is important to mention that not all factorizations of the form correspond to different , or independent , branes .",
    "two factorizations are equivalent if the corresponding matrices @xmath102 and @xmath103 can be related by an invertible linear transformation .",
    "two factorizations are also equivalent if they are related by the exchange of @xmath94 and @xmath104 : in this case they are interpreted as a brane - anti - brane pair .",
    "( the `` anti - brane '' here is a factorization that has boundary witten index and charges , computed as in , equal to those of the original brane but of opposite sign ) .",
    "moreover , it is possible to introduce in the lg formalism the notion of bound state , i.e. it is possible to give a prescription to construct , from two factorizations , a third one that describes the bound state of the two original branes .",
    "the goal is thus to identify a minimal set of branes such that all other branes can be obtained from these as bound states ( or anti - branes of bound states ) .",
    "this was just a very brief summary of the main features of the formalism that we will use .",
    "more details can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "we now apply to @xmath4 the construction just outlined .",
    "the superpotential is of the form @xmath105 , which reflects the fact that the corresponding cft is a tensor product of two minimal models .",
    "note that since this is not a rational cft , a full classification of boundary conditions is much harder to obtain than for a single minimal model . in this section",
    "we are not working in the boundary state formalism , but it is useful to keep track of how the various results translate between the two formalisms .",
    "the simplest boundary states that can be constructed in @xmath106 are tensor products of boundary states of the two @xmath34 minimal models ( this gives the so - called  rational \" boundary state ) .",
    "such a construction also exists in the lg formalism : there is a prescription for writing a factorization of @xmath96 starting from two factorizations of the one variable superpotentials @xmath107 and @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "we will call the branes obtained through this construction  tensor product branes \" .",
    "in fact , all the branes in this class can be obtained as bound states of a single matrix factorization .",
    "this follows from the fact that for superpotentials of the form @xmath109 all b - branes can be generated from the linear factorization @xmath110 , @xmath111 @xcite . therefore , since we are trying to identify a set of minimal branes , we only need to consider the tensor product of two such linear factorizations of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the corresponding factorization has rank two and is of the form @xmath112",
    "\\qquad g=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}y_1 ^ 3&y_2\\\\ y_2 ^ 3&-y_1\\end{array}\\right]\\ .\\ ] ] in the minimal model language this corresponds to the @xmath113 boundary state ( see the appendix of @xcite for the notation ) .",
    "let us now discuss some properties of these branes , which can be derived in the framework of matrix factorizations .",
    "using the residue formula one can check that all the topological disc correlators without boundary insertions vanish .",
    "this means that the corresponding physical branes are not charged under the ramond ground states and this is in fact confirmed from the boundary state analysis @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of the mirror model @xmath11 , we learn in particular that the d1-branes that are mirror to the tensor product factorizations are not charged under ramond twisted sector fields .",
    "we can also look at the spectrum of boundary operators , which can be computed as the cohomology of a brst operator constructed from @xmath97 . leaving out the details of this computation ,",
    "the result is that for the factorization the boundary witten index vanishes .",
    "moreover , one finds that the boundary chiral rings contains two fermionic modes , which are associated to moduli of the brane . through mirror symmetry ,",
    "each of them should be identified with the position and wilson line of a d1-brane , so we can conjecture that the factorization describes in fact a superposition of two branes , which are free to move independently .",

    "we introduce the notation @xmath132 for the linear factorizations and @xmath133 , with @xmath134 , for the quadratic factorizations .",
    "in fact it was shown in @xcite that the branes @xmath135 can be obtained as bound states of the linear factorizations @xmath136 .",
    "moreover , the same reference shows that the annihilation of a brane @xmath136 and its antibrane can produce a tensor product brane , if the tachyon that drives the annihilation has a specific notrivial profile .",
    "it is not clear if there are more general branes that are not obtained from the linear polynomial factorizations , but it is possible that they constitute a complete set of minimal branes for this model . some hints in this direction also come from the geometric interpretation of these branes , as we will see in the next sections . in any case , due to practical limitations , we will restrict attention to this class of branes .    unlike the tensor product branes , the branes described by the polynomial factorizations couple to some bulk observables .",
    "however , only the quadratic bulk operators @xmath137 have a non - vanishing disc one - point function .",

    ".    it will also be useful to have some information about the spectrum of boundary operators .",

    "in this section we take a different point of view and look at d - branes on @xmath11 that preserve a - type supersymmetry .",
    "ideally we would like to construct boundary states that reproduce the properties - in particular the couplings to the bulk fields - of the lg branes described in the previous section .",
    "we are especially interested in finding a geometric description of the lg branes associated with the polynomial factorizations .",

    "however , for the purposes of this section it is useful to forget about the orientation , since it does not affect the computation of twisted sector couplings that we are interested in . ] .",
    "the resulting brane should be rigid , because any displacement would lead to a configuration that does nt respect the orbifold projection .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the cycles in figure [ branes ] are precisely all those that pass through any two of the orbifold fixed points , so branes wrapping these cycles can carry charge under twisted sector fields .",
    "these observations suggest that the mirror of the b - branes corresponding to polynomial factorizations in the lg model could be , roughly , a - branes wrapping the cycles of figure [ branes ] . in the remaining part of the section we will try to give some arguments in favor of this conjectured identification .",
    "we will work in the boundary state framework , but we will not give a full boundary state description of the branes in figure [ branes ] .",
    "rather , we will derive from spacetime considerations the topological couplings of these branes and show that they match the results of the previous section ( we follow closely the general discussion of reference @xcite ) .",

    "if we are only interested in the topological couplings we can , following @xcite , consider a linear combination of states that solve the conditions in the ns sector : @xmath154 runs over the elements of the @xmath25 ring .",
    "the idea is that @xmath155 will be related by spectral flow to the terms in the physical boundary state that encode the value of the topological couplings .",
    "the relation between the coefficients @xmath156 in and the disc one point functions of the a - model observables is found expanding , neglecting all the terms involving descendants , and applying half a unit of spectral flow to implement the topological twist : @xmath157 , and in the final expression @xmath158 is the topological vacuum , which coincides with a ramond vacuum state of the untwisted theory .",
    "therefore @xmath159 where @xmath160 here stands for any a - model observable and @xmath161 denotes the inverse of the topological metric @xmath162 @xcite .    in order to use the formula we will need to determine the metric @xmath163 .",
    "it is easier to compute the two - point function on the b - side , in the lg model . here",
    "the correlators of the bulk observables ( in the theory without boundaries ) are given by @xmath164 where again the unimportant overall factor has been fixed for convenience .",
    "applying this formula we find that the metric @xmath165 only mixes the quadratic lg operators among themselves and on these subset of operators it looks like @xmath166 from the cft point of view , this is simply the statement that the @xmath63-th twisted sector only couples to the @xmath167-th twisted sector , with an additional constraint on the charges imposed by the enhanced @xmath31 symmetry .      since the branes that we are trying to describe are only charged under ramond fields in the second twisted sector ( these are the observables @xmath168 in lg language ) , for the purpose of deriving the topological couplings we can think of the boundary state as being constructed in two steps .",
    "we can first write down some boundary states invariant under the @xmath52 subgroup of the orbifold group and then , as a second step , superpose two such states to impose the full @xmath17 invariance . for concreteness",
    "let us focus on a brane wrapping the cycle ( a ) in figure [ branes ] .",
    "we start by writing the boundary state for a brane entended in the @xmath169 direction inside @xmath28 , imposing for the moment only a @xmath52 projection . the conditions @xmath170 are solved in a @xmath52 twisted sector by the coherent state @xmath171 |{\\sigma^{(\\frac{k}{2})}}\\rangle_{ns}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath172 and @xmath173 denotes the ns vacuum in the sector twisted by @xmath174 , with the constraint @xmath175 from the zero modes boundary conditions . for the configuration we are considering , taking into account and , the relevant twisted sectors are those created by @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "we thus write as an ansatz the linear combination of coherent states @xmath178 \\,,\\ ] ] with some normalization constant @xmath179 .    a complete analysis of boundary states for d1 branes extended in @xmath180 orbifolds",
    "was carried out in @xcite . in this section",
    "we do not aim to write the full boundary states for the branes on @xmath11 , but we can borrow an argument given in @xcite to associate a physical meaning to the phase that appears in .",
    "this in turn will allow us to give an interpretation to the topological one - point functions computed in the previous section .",
    "the argument can be summarized as follows .",
    "the two fixed points of the @xmath180 orbifold correspond to the two conjugacy classes of the group @xmath181 where @xmath182 denotes the group of translations by @xmath183 . if we consider the transformations @xmath184 such that @xmath185 then we can think of @xmath186 and @xmath187 as being associated with the sectors twisted by @xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively . in overlap computations ,",
    "the terms coming from the overlap of the ishibashi states @xmath190 are interpreted in the open string channel as terms coming from a trace with a @xmath188 insertion .",
    "similarly , the overlap of @xmath191 is associated with a term in the open string trace with a @xmath189 insertion .",
    "if we take a string stretched between two branes with wilson lines @xmath192 and @xmath193 , the wave function of the open string states picks up a phase @xmath194 under a translation by @xmath183 . under the action of @xmath52 the winding quantum number @xmath195 picks up a sign , so",
    "invariance of the unwtisted sector coherent state @xmath196 restricts the choice of wilson line to the values @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , from what we have said so far , for a string stretched between two branes with the same @xmath192 the action of @xmath188 and @xmath189 should be identical , and so the terms containing @xmath190 and @xmath191 should contribute equally to the overlap . instead ,",
    "if the value of @xmath192 is different for the two branes , then the contributions of the overlaps should differ by a sign , to account for the phase @xmath198 . in conclusion , as the notation suggests , in the parameter @xmath199 should be interpreted as the wilson line on the brane , with @xmath200 .    to impose the full @xmath17 projection we need to add the image of the brane under the transformation @xmath201 . for the image the discussion goes as before ,",
    "so we can consider a linear combination of states @xmath202\\,.\\ ] ] note that the value of the wilson line is again @xmath199 to respect the @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "superposing and , we conclude that the boundary state that describes a brane wrapping the cycle ( a ) in figure [ branes ] must contain the ramond sector terms related by spectral flow to @xmath203 = \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathcal{n}\\big[\\sqrt{2 } e^{i\\theta_{a}}\\,|\\sigma^{(\\frac{2}{4})}_{11}\\rangle + \\ , |\\sigma^{(\\frac{2}{4})}_{01}\\rangle \\big]+\\dots\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath204 is the @xmath17 invariant combination of twist fields and we have expanded the coherent states as in .",
    "what we have gained by the analysis of the previous paragraph is that we could relate the coefficients in to the value of the wilson lines on the branes .    using",
    ", we can extract from the expression the ratio of couplings @xmath205 and comparison with table [ pippo ] shows that this is the correct answer for the lg branes described by linear factorizations with @xmath206 for the different choices of wilson line @xmath207 .",
    "this is consistent with the identification    [ amap ] @xmath208    where now @xmath209 and @xmath210 are ishibashi states of the @xmath17 orbifold . for simplicity here we have dropped the normalization factor .",
    "along the same lines , the configuration ( b ) in figure [ branes ] can be associated with the linear combination of coherent states @xmath211\\,,\\ ] ] which is consistent with the map    [ bmap ] @xmath212    the sign in front of @xmath210 is required , by an argument similar ( t - dual ) to the one given above , because a phase @xmath213 appears in the wave functions associated with open strings that stretch between the branes in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the configurations ( c ) and ( d ) in figure [ branes ] are related to the quadratic factorizations of the lg superpotential @xmath92 .",
    "the notation is @xmath133 . for the configuration ( c ) we can write @xmath214 and @xmath215 for the two different choices of wilson lines @xmath216 and @xmath217 :    [ cmap ] @xmath218    the remaining factorization @xmath219 will thus correspond to configuration ( d ) . in this case",
    "we do nt have a wilson line degree of freedom , since the @xmath17 symmetry requires the contribution from the two @xmath52 fixed points to be the same . repeating the steps illustrated before ,",
    "we can associate to one  component \" of the brane the linear combination of ishibashi states @xmath220 = \\sqrt{2}\\ , \\mathcal{n } \\ , { |\\kern-.16em |\\sigma^{(\\frac{2}{4})}_{01}\\rangle\\kern-.24em \\rangle}_{\\hat{1}+\\hat{2 } }   \\nonumber \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the same for the image . as a result",
    "we find @xmath221 note that the normalization is consistent with the relative factor of @xmath222 that we observe in table [ pippo ] between the charge of this brane and the @xmath223 charge of the other branes .      as a further check",
    ", we now compare the intersection matrix of the lg branes computed in section [ lgbranes ] with the index @xmath224 of the boundary cft . in the closed string channel",
    "this is expressed as an overlap @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is the left @xmath31 r - chrage and the subscript @xmath227 indicates that we only take the ramond terms ( ground states ) in the boundary state , properly normalized .",
    "note that the ground states that contribute in our case will have @xmath228 ( see table [ rrgs ] in the appendix ) .",
    "we begin by trying to reproduce the intersection matrix @xmath229 , which we found earlier to have the form .",
    "we find the matrix elements @xmath230 one can check that these results agree with precisely if the identifications and hold .",
    "similarly , we find for @xmath231 the matrix elements @xmath232 using the identifications and these are seen to agree with the answer found from the lg computation . for completeness",
    ", we also write the result of the computation of @xmath233 : @xmath234 which is in agreement with .",
    "note that here the intersection matrix appears to be symmetric by construction , whereas in the lg formalism this property is not manifest .",
    "so far we have looked at the properties of branes in the topological sector of @xmath0 and the mirror lg model @xmath4 , showing that they agree . in the topological sector",
    "this lg model is completely equivalent to the @xmath10 cft and we have mentioned earlier that the map between the lg b - branes and the boundary states in the cft is known explicitly .",
    "more precisely , the statement is that one can construct some consistent boundary states , with b - type boundary conditions , that reproduce all the properties of the topological b - branes @xcite .",
    "however , the boundary states contain more information , since they are constructed in the physical theory . in this section",
    "we use the explicit knowledge of boundary states in the minimal models ( and how they relate to the lg factorizations ) to write down the boundary states for the a - branes on @xmath11 .",
    "the goal is to complete and put on firmer ground the geometric picture of section [ abranes ] .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the lg branes obtained from polynomial factorizations of the form are described in cft language by permutation boundary states @xcite . in the case of the tensor product of two minimal models ,",
    "these satisfy the b - type boundary conditions @xmath235 which mix the currents of the two minimal models .",
    "again , we take @xmath152 for consistency with the combination of supercharges preserved by the lg branes . through the map discussed in section [ cft ]",
    ", these boundary conditions can be rewritten in terms of @xmath0 currents .",
    "one finds simply @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the @xmath31 r - current and @xmath238 is the other @xmath31 current , associated with the enhanced symmetry at the self - dual radius .",
    "these are , as expected , a - type boundary conditions .",
    "the choice of gluing with a nontrivial permutation in is reflected here in the boundary condition imposed on @xmath239 . as is familiar from the case of an unorbifolded compactification on a circle at the self - dual radius , where the geometry is effectively an @xmath240 , here we can think of the geometry as containing an extra circle , associated with the current @xmath241 .",
    "the permutation and tensor product branes are distinguished by having , respectively , dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions in this direction .      where the superscript @xmath69 distinguishes the ishibashi states that solve the gluing conditions above and the coefficients are @xmath243}{\\sin[\\frac{\\pi}{4}(l+1)]}\\,.\\ ] ] the quantum numbers",
    "@xmath244 that label the ishibashi states take the values @xmath245 , @xmath246 ( mod @xmath247 ) , @xmath248 ( mod @xmath249 ) , with the conditions that @xmath250 and @xmath251 must be even . note that in it has been assumed that @xmath252 and @xmath253 , because this is necessary for the boundary conditions to make sense .",
    "the square brackets in express the fact that the quantum numbers are defined up to the equivalence relations @xmath254 these relations can be used to restrict the sum in to @xmath255 , while @xmath256 is still summed over all values @xmath257 because @xmath258 are not independent labels in the construction of permutation ishibashi states .",
