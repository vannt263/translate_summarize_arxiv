    "in quantum optics and condensed matter physics , a great effort has been oriented to the study of single quantum systems , or a few of them , and their experimental coherent control .",
    "this is the case of cavity qed  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite , circuit qed  @xcite , among others . on the other hand , many - particle physics describes a variety of systems where collective effects may play a central role .",
    "the interaction of a single atom with a quantized electromagnetic mode , described by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model  @xcite , has played a central role in quantum optics and other related physical systems . among its many fundamental predictions , we can mention vacuum - field rabi oscillations , collapses and revivals of atomic populations , and squeezing of the radiation field  @xcite .",
    "atomic cloud physics can be conveniently described by the dicke model  @xcite , when considering the interaction of atoms with light in free space , or by the tavis - cummings ( tc ) model  @xcite , when the coupling takes place inside a cavity . in most treatments and applications of the tc model ,",
    "a constant coupling between the atoms and the radiation field is assumed , simplification that greatly reduces the complexity of an analytical description  @xcite . even in the case of many atoms , the homogeneous - coupling case profits from the @xmath1 group structure of the collective operators , allowing at least numerical solutions .",
    "however , the situation is drastically different when we consider the more realistic case of inhomogeneous coupling . in this case",
    ", there is no such straightforward way to access the hilbert space , because all angular momenta representations are mixed through the dynamical evolution of the system and no analytical approach is known .    on the other hand , electron and nuclear spin dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures",
    "has become of central interest in last years  @xcite , and several techniques for quantum information processing have been proposed  @xcite . for example",
    ", ensembles of polarized nuclear spins in quantum dots  @xcite and quantum hall semiconductor nanostructures  @xcite have been proposed as a long - lived quantum memory for the electron spin .",
    "recently , polarization procedures for the nuclear spins in a quantum dot have been studied theoretically  @xcite , and first experiments have achieved considerable dynamical nuclear polarization  @xcite .",
    "however , difficulties in producing a fully polarized nuclear state suggest the necessity of analyzing the effect of imperfect polarization .",
    "this treatment faces the same theoretical challenges as the study of the inhomogeneous tc model , because of the unavoidable inhomogeneous coupling of electron and nuclear spins in quantum dots .    in this work",
    ", we develop an effective approach to study the dynamics of a single mode / particle coupled inhomogeneously to a large number of particles .",
    "in particular , we analyze in sec .",
    "[ itc ] the general interaction of a collection of two - level atoms with a quantized field mode , that is , the inhomogeneous tc model .",
    "we identify a subset of the hilbert space that is relevant for the dynamics and show that we are able to reproduce accurate results with a small number of states . in sec .",
    "[ sect_qd ] we consider the hyperfine interaction of a single excess electron spin confined in a quantum dot with quasi - polarized nuclear spins . using the formalism developed in section  [ itc ] , we study the transfer of quantum information between those systems in the presence of a single excitation in the nuclear spin system prior to the write - in procedure . in sec .",
    "iv , we present our concluding remarks .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the inhomogeneous coupling of @xmath0 atoms with a quantized single field mode , in the interaction picture and under resonant conditions , can be written as @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the ( real ) inhomogeneous coupling strength of atom @xmath4 at position @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the lowering ( raising ) operator of atom @xmath4 , and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the field mode .",
    "we will refer to this model as the inhomogeneous tavis - cummings ( itc ) model . in the homogeneous case , @xmath10 , @xmath11",
    ", one can define as angular momentum operator @xmath12 , describing transitions between the common eigenvectors of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "this is not true for the inhomogeneous case , because @xmath16 does not satisfy anymore the @xmath1 algebra .",
    "however , we will show that this problem can still be addressed with certain restrictions .",
    "the strategy consists in following the hilbert space that the system will visit along its evolution , and implementing a truncation that will depend on the window evolution time .",
    "let us first consider the initial condition given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes a photonic fock state and @xmath19 the collection of @xmath0 atoms in the ground state . for each product state @xmath20 .",
    "if the initial state is @xmath21 , the unitary evolution is trivial @xmath22 , @xmath23 produces a nontrivial dynamics via the term @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents a @xmath0-atom state with one excitation in the @xmath4th atom .",
    "we define @xmath27 a normalized state such that @xmath28 note that the system evolves in a closed two - dimensional subspace @xmath29 @xmath30 the generated state @xmath31 produces now @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the same time @xmath35 evolves according to @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the result is a one excitation state in the atomic system which is different from @xmath39 defined in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) .",
    "the resulting state can be expressed  as a linear combination of @xmath39 and an orthogonal state @xmath40 that can be conveniently expressed as @xmath41 yielding @xmath42 is a new orthogonal state of the considered @xmath43-excitation hilbert subspace . via @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath45 , the latter being coupled only to the state @xmath31 .",
    "we observe also that , while @xmath46 where we introduced @xmath47 perpendicular to @xmath48 .",
    "the state @xmath49 thus obtained is coupled via @xmath50 to states @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is orthogonal to @xmath54 , and so on .",
    "in fact , applying @xmath55 on @xmath56 and the collective atomic states couple following the table of fig .  [ couplings ] . in general , the states @xmath57 lead to linearly independent subspaces of conserved @xmath58 excitations .",
    "eventually , all states of the hilbert space will be visited by an arbitrary system evolution but , within a given time window , only a restricted portion of the hilbert space will be accessed .",
    "however , in the example of fig .",
    "[ pob ] , we observe that our approximation for the evolution of the collective atomic ground state is in good agreement with the exact result for very long times , reproducing even population collapses and revivals .",
    "surprisingly , to achieve this level of accuracy , it is enough to consider the first two rows displayed in fig .",
    "[ couplings ] .",
    "the number of columns that has to be considered is determined by the number of initial excitations in the system because the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) preserves this number . in consequence ,",
    "the low mean photon number , @xmath59 , suggests that the initially unpopulated atomic state may reach at most a similar mean value .",
    "given that the number of atoms is larger , @xmath60 , it is expected that the normalized couplings between the few visited atomic states in the first row of fig .",
    "[ couplings ] and the rows below are quite small . in order to confirm this intuition",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ popn ] how the population of the second and third rows of fig .",
    "[ couplings ] decreases as the number of atoms @xmath0 increases for the same parameters of fig .",
    "clearly , also increasing inhomogeneity of the coupling causes increased leakage into higher order rows , see eq .",
    "( [ xxx ] ) .",
    "the example of fig .",
    "[ pob ] shows a reduction of the hilbert space dimension from @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the dimension of the truncated field space , to an effective size of @xmath63 .",
    "in general , to improve the accuracy , we only need to take into account more rows in the calculation .",

    "it is now interesting to see how strong can be the effects of inhomogeneity on the dynamics of relevant observables .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ sq8 ] , we compare the different predictions for the fluctuations of the field quadratures . for the homogeneous case , the first time scale corresponds to @xmath69 , while for the inhomogeneous case the analogous would be @xmath70 . in this manner , to compare both cases , the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous we consider the homogeneous coupling case with coupling @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "[ sq8 ] we observe that not only does the inhomogeneous situation differ from the homogeneous in the typical timescale of the dynamics , but also it shows additional effects , which , in the case we consider , are reflected in an increase of the quadrature fluctuations .",
    "our method allows the study of these effects for particle numbers that are non tractable for standard simulation methods .     for @xmath72 , initial atomic ground state , and a coherent field with @xmath73 .",

    "another interesting physical system involving inhomogeneous coupling in a natural way is that of a single electron confined in a quantum dot surrounded by nuclear spins . in presence of a magnetic field @xmath77 along the @xmath78-axis the associated hamiltonian , neglecting dipolar interactions between nuclear spins ,",
    "can be written as  @xcite @xmath79 here , the first two terms are the zeeman energies of the electron and nuclear spins , and @xmath80 describes the hyperfine contact interaction of a single electron spin interacting with @xmath0 nuclear spins , where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath83 are the inhomogeneous coupling constants , where @xmath84 is the hyperfine coupling constant , @xmath85 is the inverse density of nuclei in the material , and @xmath86 is the envelope function of the electron at position @xmath87 .",
    "the term @xmath88 induces an effective magnetic field for the electron @xmath89 , the so called overhauser shift .",
    "below , the nuclear zeeman energies will be neglected , as their magnetic moment is much smaller than the one for the electron  @xcite .    by applying an appropriate field @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 , one may allow the spin - exchange term to dominate the dynamics  @xcite . in this case , and defining @xmath92 , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamil1 ] ) approximately reduces to @xmath93 .",
    "however , in general , the term @xmath94 can not be neglected . even on resonance , where @xmath95 , one has @xmath96 . in conclusion , the overhauser field felt by the electron spin can not be fully compensated . to include this effect we rewrite the @xmath97-part of the interaction as @xmath98 , so that the on - resonance hamiltonian becomes @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the expectation value with respect to the fully polarized state",
    ", @xmath101 is the average coupling constant ( which equals @xmath102 due to the normalization of the electron wave function ) , and @xmath103 .",
    "the latter term , i.e. the inhomogeneous contribution to the @xmath78-term of the interaction , can be treated perturbatively . as we show later",
    ", the homogeneous @xmath97-term @xmath104 is neglected with respect to the flip - flop term due to a small factor @xmath105 .",
    "the term @xmath106 is even smaller and negligible , because it depends additionally on an inhomogeneity parameter , like the variance of the ( smooth ) electron wave function .    in this work we consider @xmath107 nuclear spins in a spherical quantum dot , and @xmath108 as the electron envelope function  @xcite of size @xmath109 .",
    "the inhomogeneous coupling of the electron spin to the nuclear spins does not allow for a general analytical solution of the dynamics .",
    "the assumption of a fully polarized initial nuclear spin state reduces the dimension of the relevant hilbert space from @xmath110 to @xmath111 and therefore the problem is readily analyzed . on the other hand",
    ", a more general initial state of nuclear spins vastly increases the dimension of the hilbert space that the system will visit along the evolution .",
    "motivated by the proposals for quantum information storage via the hyperfine interaction  @xcite , we will study situations of imperfect , but high , polarization .",
    "we analyze the case where the dynamics involves one excitation in the nuclear spin system , which we will refer to as `` defect '' .",
    "we show , with methods similar to the ones developed in sec .",
    "ii , that the relevant hilbert space remains still small .",
    "the most general pure state describing this situation can be written as @xmath112 with @xmath113 , and @xmath114 represents the state @xmath115 with an inverted nuclear spin at position @xmath116 .",

    "let us consider two possible initial states for the electron and the nuclear spins with a single imperfection , @xmath122 in order to solve the dynamical evolution of the composite system , we employ the recipe of following the relevant hilbert space , as described in sec .",
    "we observe that , under the action of the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) , the initial state @xmath123 is coupled to the state @xmath124 via @xmath125 , with @xmath126 and @xmath127 the state @xmath124 will be coupled through the term @xmath128 to a state with one excitation , but different from @xmath129 .",
    "similar to the formalism developed in sec .",

    "@xmath131 is orthogonal to state @xmath132 , with @xmath133 and @xmath134 . finally , we observe that @xmath135 . in summary ,",
    "the exchange terms yield @xmath136 furthermore , the @xmath97-interaction yields matrix elements @xmath137 therefore , for the initial condition of eq .  (",
    "[ cond1 ] ) the system evolves only in the subspace spanned by @xmath138 .",
