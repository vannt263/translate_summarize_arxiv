    "<S> cosmology  galaxies : clustering this paper summarizes the physical mechanisms that encode the type and quantity of cosmological matter in the properties of large - scale structure , and reviews the application of such tests to current datasets . </S>",
    "<S> the key lengths of the horizon size at matter - radiation equality and at last scattering determine the total matter density and its ratio to the relativistic density ; acoustic oscillations can diagnose whether the matter is collisionless , and small - scale structure or its absence can limit the mass of any dark - matter relic particle . </S>",
    "<S> the most stringent constraints come from combining data on present - day galaxy clustering with data on cmb anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis breaks the degeneracies inherent in either dataset alone , and proves that the universe is very close to flat . </S>",
    "<S> the matter content is accurately consistent with pure cold dark matter , with about 25% of the critical density , and fluctuations that are scalar - only , adiabatic and scale - invariant . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that these conclusions can not be evaded by adjusting either the equation of state of the vacuum , or the total relativistic density .    </S>",
    "<S> [ firstpage ]    the simplest explanation for the large - scale structure in the galaxy distribution is gravitational instability acting on some small initial departures from homogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> this model has now reached a stage of considerable sophistication , and accounts impressively for the very detailed data emerging from the current generation of surveys .    </S>",
    "<S> the ability to use observations of large - scale structure to measure the matter content of the universe depends on understanding the characteristic scales that should be introduced by gravitational instability . </S>",
    "<S> these are most clearly seen in fourier space , where the fractional density contrast is @xmath0 , with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum is @xmath2 , conveniently expressed in the dimensionless form , where @xmath3 is the variance in @xmath4 per @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption is that this can be decomposed into a primordial component of power - law form , and a transfer function : @xmath6 where the function @xmath7 contains the information about the matter content . </S>",
    "<S> a generic expectation for the primordial fluctuations is that @xmath8 , so that the power spectrum of potential fluctuations is 3d flicker noise , and the deviations of the metric from flatness are fractal - like . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of inflation , which makes an important test of the theory , is that small deviations from exact @xmath8 behaviour may be expected .    </S>",
    "<S> the transfer function depends on a number of characteristics of the primordial perturbations , both qualitative and quantitative :    perturbation mode . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest choice is that the initial fluctuations were adiabatic : i.e. photon densities and matter densities were compressed equally . </S>",
    "<S> this is the prediction of single - field inflation models . in more complex models , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the radiation is left unperturbed , and only the matter fluctuates . </S>",
    "<S> such isocurvature modes or entropy perturbations match the cmb anisotropy data poorly , so we will neglect them . </S>",
    "<S> however , a small admixture of isocurvature modes can always be tolerated , and this can widen the space of allowed models ( e.g. bucher , moodley & turok 2002 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> relativistic content . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that most of the characteristics of cosmological perturbations were set at high redshifts , when the relativistic particle content ( at least photons plus light neutrinos ) was dynamically important .    </S>",
    "<S> baryonic content . at early times , </S>",
    "<S> the baryonic plasma is strongly coupled to the photons via thomson scattering , thus acting as a fluid with a sound speed of up to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> acoustic oscillations in this fluid leave measurable features in the transfer function .    </S>",
    "<S> collisionless content . </S>",
    "<S> growth of perturbations in weakly - interacting dark matter proceed in a simpler was , and they do not support pressure - driven oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> also , the key free - streaming property of collisionless particles can lead to erasure of small - scale perturbations .    vacuum - energy content . </S>",
    "<S> in general , a homogeneous background does not influence the scale dependence of perturbation growth  </S>",
    "<S> rather , the growth rate of perturbations of all wavelengths is altered . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the main influence of the vacuum energy is via the overall amplitude of fluctuations plus , in the case of the cmb , the conversion from spatial scale of fluctuations observed at redshift 1100 to angle subtended today .    </S>",
    "<S> the transfer function for models with the full above list of ingredients was first computed accurately by bond & szalay ( 1983 ) , and is today routinely available via public - domain codes such as cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> some illustrative results are shown in figure  1 . </S>",
    "<S> leaving aside the isocurvature models , all adiabatic cases have @xmath10 on large scales  </S>",
    "<S> i.e. there is growth at the universal rate ( which is such that the amplitude of potential perturbations is constant until the vacuum starts to be important at @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the different shapes of the functions can be understood intuitively in terms of a few special length scales , as follows :    = 0.6    * ( 1 ) horizon length at matter - radiation equality . * </S>",
    "<S> the main bend visible in all transfer functions is due to the mszros effect , which arises because the universe is radiation dominated at early times . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in the matter can only grow if dark matter and radiation fall together . </S>",
    "<S> this does not happen for perturbations of small wavelength , because photons and matter can separate . </S>",
    "<S> growth only occurs for perturbations of wavelength larger than the horizon distance , where there has been no time for the matter and radiation to separate . </S>",
    "<S> the relative diminution in fluctuations at high @xmath12 is the amount of growth that is missed between horizon entry and @xmath13 , and this change is easily shown to be @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the approximate limits of the cdm transfer function are therefore @xmath15^{-2 } \\quad\\quad & \\hbox{$kd_{\\japsub   h}(z_{\\rm eq})\\gg 1$}. \\cr } \\ ] ]    this process continues , until the universe becomes matter dominated at @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect a characteristic ` break ' in the fluctuation spectrum around the comoving horizon length at this time : @xmath17 since distances in cosmology always scale as @xmath18 , this means that @xmath19 should be observable </S>",
    "<S> .    * ( 2 ) free - streaming length . </S>",
    "<S> * this relatively gentle filtering away of the initial fluctuations is all that applies to a universe dominated by cold dark matter , in which random velocities are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> a cdm universe thus contains fluctuations in the dark matter on all scales , and structure formation proceeds via hierarchical process in which nonlinear structures grow via mergers .    </S>",
    "<S> examples of cdm would be thermal relic wimps with masses of order 100  gev . </S>",
    "<S> relic particles that were never in equilibrium , such as axions , also come under this heading , as do more exotic possibilities such as primordial black holes . </S>",
    "<S> a more interesting case arises when thermal relics have lower masses . for collisionless dark matter </S>",
    "<S> , perturbations can be erased simply by free streaming : random particle velocities cause blobs to disperse . at early times ( @xmath20 ) , the particles will travel at @xmath21 , and so any perturbation that has entered the horizon will be damped . </S>",
    "<S> this process ceases when the particles become non - relativistic , so that perturbations are erased up to proper lengthscales of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this translates to a comoving horizon scale ( @xmath23 during the radiation era ) at @xmath24 of @xmath25 ( in detail , the appropriate figure for neutrinos will be smaller by @xmath26 since they have a smaller temperature than the photons ) . a light neutrino - like relic that decouples while it is relativistic satisfies @xmath27 thus , the damping scale for hdm ( hot dark matter ) is of order the bend scale . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , if the particle decouples sufficiently early , its relative number density is boosted by annihilations , so that the critical particle mass to make @xmath28 can be boosted to around 110  kev ( warm dark matter ) . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of galaxies at @xmath29 tells us that the coherence scale must have been below about 100  kpc , so wdm is close to being ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> a similar constraint is obtained from small - scale structure in the lyman - alpha forest ( narayanan et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2000 ) : @xmath30  kev .    </S>",
    "<S> a more interesting ( and probably more practically relevant ) case is when the dark matter is a mixture of hot and cold components . </S>",
    "<S> the free - streaming length for the hot component can therefore be very large , but within range of observations . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersal of hdm fluctuations reduces the cdm growth rate on all scales below @xmath31  or , relative to small scales , there is an enhancement in large - scale power .    * </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) acoustic horizon length . </S>",
    "<S> * the horizon at matter - radiation equality also enters in the properties of the baryon component . </S>",
    "<S> since the sound speed is of order @xmath21 , the largest scales that can undergo a single acoustic oscillation are of order the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the transfer function for a purely baryonic universe shows large modulations , reflecting the number of oscillations that were completed before the universe became matter dominated and the pressure support dropped . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of such large modulations in real data is one of the most generic reasons for believing in collisionless dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> acoustic oscillations persist even when baryons are subdominant , however , and can be detectable as lower - level modulations in the transfer function ( e.g. goldberg & strauss 1998 ; meiksin et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1999 ) .    * </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) silk damping length . </S>",
    "<S> * acoustic oscillations are also damped on small scales , where the process is called silk damping : the mean free path of photons due to scattering by the plasma is non - zero , and so radiation can diffuse out of a perturbation , convecting the plasma with it . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be seen in figure 1 at @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> the largest dataset for which a thorough comparison with the above picture has been made is the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this survey was designed around the 2df multi - fibre spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope , which is capable of observing up to 400 objects simultaneously over a 2  degree diameter field of view . for details of the instrument and its performance </S>",
    "<S> see http://www.aao.gov.au/2df/ , and also lewis et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the apm galaxy catalogue ( maddox et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> 1990a , b , c ) ; this includes over 5  million galaxies down to @xmath33 in both north and south galactic hemispheres over a region of almost @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath35 magnitude system is related to the johnson  </S>",
    "<S> cousins system by @xmath36 , where the colour term is estimated from comparison with the sdss early data release ( stoughton et al . 2002 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1.0    the 2dfgrs geometry consists of two contiguous declination strips , plus 100 random 2-degree fields . </S>",
    "<S> one strip is in the southern galactic hemisphere and covers approximately 75@xmath37@xmath3815@xmath37 centred close to the sgp at ( @xmath39)=(@xmath40,@xmath41 ) ; the other strip is in the northern galactic hemisphere and covers @xmath42 centred at ( @xmath39)=(@xmath43,@xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 100 random fields are spread uniformly over the 7000  deg@xmath45 region of the apm catalogue in the southern galactic hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is limited to be brighter than an extinction - corrected magnitude of @xmath46 ( using the extinction maps of schlegel et  al.1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this limit gives a good match between the density on the sky of galaxies and 2df fibres .    </S>",
    "<S> after an extensive period of commissioning of the 2df instrument , 2dfgrs observing began in earnest in may 1997 , and terminated in april 2002 . in total , observations were made of 899 fields , yielding redshifts and identifications for 232,529 galaxies , 13976 stars and 172 qsos , at an overall completeness of 93% . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy redshifts are assigned a quality flag from 1 to 5 , where the probability of error is highest at low @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> most analyses are restricted to @xmath48 galaxies , of which there are currently 221,496 . </S>",
    "<S> an interim data release took place in july 2001 , consisting of approximately 100,000 galaxies ( see colless et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> a public release of the full photometric and spectroscopic database is scheduled for july 2003 . </S>",
    "<S> the completed 2dfgrs yields a striking view of the galaxy distribution over large cosmological volumes . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in figure  2 , which shows the projection of a subset of the galaxies in the northern and southern strips onto @xmath49 slices . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is the culmination of decades of effort in the investigation of large - scale structure , and we are fortunate to have this detailed view for the first time .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.6    perhaps the key aim of the 2dfgrs was to perform an accurate measurement of the 3d clustering power spectrum , in order to improve on the apm result , which was deduced by deprojection of angular clustering ( baugh & efstathiou 1993 , 1994 ) . the results of this direct estimation of the 3d power spectrum are shown in figure  3 ( percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this power - spectrum estimate uses the fft - based approach of feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 ; fkp ) , and needs to be interpreted with care . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it is a raw redshift - space estimate , so that the power beyond @xmath50 is severely damped by smearing due to peculiar velocities , as well as being affected by nonlinear evolution . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the fkp estimator yields the true power convolved with the window function . </S>",
    "<S> this modifies the power significantly at large scales ( roughly a 20% correction ) . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate correction for this has been made in figure  3 .     </S>",
    "<S> = 0.49 1em = 0.49    the fundamental assumption is that , on large scales , linear biasing applies , so that the nonlinear galaxy power spectrum in redshift space has a shape identical to that of linear theory in real space . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is valid for @xmath51 ; the detailed justification comes from analyzing realistic mock data derived from @xmath52-body simulations ( cole et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the free parameters in fitting cdm models are thus the primordial spectral index , @xmath53 , the hubble parameter , @xmath54 , the total matter density , @xmath55 , and the baryon fraction , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the vacuum energy does not affect the constraints . </S>",
    "<S> initially , we show results assuming @xmath8 ; this assumption is relaxed later .    </S>",
    "<S> an accurate model comparison requires the full covariance matrix of the data , because the convolving effect of the window function causes the power at adjacent @xmath12 values to be correlated . </S>",
    "<S> this covariance matrix was estimated by applying the survey window to a library of gaussian realisations of linear density fields , and checked against a set of mock catalogues . </S>",
    "<S> it is now possible to explore the space of cdm models , and likelihood contours in @xmath56 versus @xmath57 are shown in figure  4 . at each point in this surface </S>",
    "<S> we have marginalized by integrating the likelihood surface over the two free parameters , @xmath54 and the power spectrum amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we have added a gaussian prior @xmath58 , representing external constraints such as the hst key project ( freedman et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) ; this has only a minor effect on the results .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  4a shows that there is a degeneracy between @xmath57 and the baryonic fraction @xmath56 . however , there are two local maxima in the likelihood , one with @xmath59 and @xmath60 baryons , plus a secondary solution @xmath61 and @xmath62 baryons . </S>",
    "<S> the high - density model can be rejected through a variety of arguments , and the preferred solution is @xmath63 the 2dfgrs data are compared to the best - fit linear power spectra convolved with the window function in figure  4b . </S>",
    "<S> the low - density model fits the overall shape of the spectrum with relatively small ` wiggles ' , while the solution at @xmath64 provides a better fit to the bump at @xmath65 , but fits the overall shape less well . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary analysis of @xmath66 from the full final dataset shows that @xmath66 becomes smoother : the high - baryon solution becomes disfavoured , and the uncertainties narrow slightly around the lower - density solution : @xmath67 ; @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare these conclusions with other constraints . </S>",
    "<S> these are shown on figure  4 , assuming @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> latest estimates of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio in qso spectra combined with big - bang nucleosynthesis theory predict @xmath70 ( burles et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) , which translates to the shown locus of @xmath71 vs @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray cluster analysis predicts a baryon fraction @xmath72 ( evrard 1997 ) which is within @xmath73 of our value . </S>",
    "<S> these loci intersect very close to our preferred model .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the main point to emphasise here is that the 2dfgrs results are not greatly sensitive to the assumed tilt of the primordial spectrum . as discussed below </S>",
    "<S> , cmb data show that @xmath8 is a very good approximation ; in any case , very substantial tilts ( @xmath74 ) are required to alter the conclusions significantly .    </S>",
    "<S> the main residual worry about accepting the above conclusions is probably whether the assumption of linear bias can really be valid . in general , concentration towards higher - density regions </S>",
    "<S> both raises the amplitude of clustering , but also steepens the correlations , so that bias is largest on small scales . a simple model that illustrates this is to assume that the density field is a lognormal process . </S>",
    "<S> a nonlinear transformation @xmath75 then gives a correlation function @xmath76 ( mann , peacock & heavens 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we need to be clear of the regime in which the bias depends on scale .    </S>",
    "<S> one way in which this issue can be studied is to consider subsamples with very different degrees of bias . </S>",
    "<S> colour information has recently been added to the 2dfgrs database using supercosmos scans of the ukst red plates ( hambly et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) , and a division at rest - frame photographic @xmath77 nicely separates ellipticals from spirals . figure  5 shows the power spectra for the 2dfgrs divided in this way . </S>",
    "<S> the shapes are almost identical ( perhaps not so surprising , since the cosmic variance effects are closely correlated in these co - spatial samples ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , what is impressive is that the relative bias is almost precisely independent of scale , even though the red subset is rather strongly biased relative to the blue subset ( relative @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides some reassurance that the large - scale @xmath66 reflects the underlying properties of the dark matter , rather than depending on the particular class of galaxies used to measure it .     </S>",
    "<S> = 0.49 1em = 0.49    the 2dfgrs power spectrum contains important information about the key parameters of the cosmological model , but we have seen that additional assumptions are needed , in particular the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> observations of cmb anisotropies can in principle measure most of the cosmological parameters , and combination with the 2dfgrs can lift most of the degeneracies inherent in the cmb - only analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of interest to see what emerges from a joint analysis . </S>",
    "<S> these issues are discussed in efstathiou et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cmb data alone contain two important degeneracies : the ` geometrical ' and ` tensor ' degeneracies .    </S>",
    "<S> * geometrical degeneracy * in the former case , one can evade the commonly - stated cmb conclusion that the universe is flat , by adjusting both @xmath79 and @xmath54 to extreme values ( zaldarriaga et  al . </S>",
    "<S> 1997 ; bond et  al . </S>",
    "<S> 1997 ; efstathiou & bond 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the normal flatness argument takes the comoving horizon size at last scattering @xmath80 and divides it by the present - day horizon size for a zero-@xmath79 universe , @xmath81 to yield a main characteristic angle that scales as @xmath82 . large curvature ( i.e. low @xmath55 ) </S>",
    "<S> is ruled out because the main peak in the cmb power spectrum is not seen at very small angles . </S>",
    "<S> however , introducing vacuum energy changes the conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> if we take a family of models with fixed initial perturbation spectra , fixed physical densities @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and vary both @xmath85 and the curvature to keep a fixed value of the angular size distance to last scattering , then the resulting cmb power spectra are identical ( except for the integrated sachs - wolfe effect at very low multipoles , and second - order effects at high @xmath86 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this degeneracy occurs because the physical densities control the structure of the perturbations in physical mpc at last scattering , while curvature , @xmath85 and @xmath55 govern the proportionality between length at last scattering and observed angle . in order to break the degeneracy , </S>",
    "<S> additional information is needed . </S>",
    "<S> this could be in the form of external data on the hubble constant , but the most elegant approach is to add the 2dfgrs data , so that conclusions are based only on the shapes of power spectra . </S>",
    "<S> efstathiou et al . ( 2002 ) show that doing this yields a total density ( @xmath87 ) at 95% confidence </S>",
    "<S> . we can therefore be confident that the universe is very nearly flat ; hereafter it will be assumed that this is exactly true .    </S>",
    "<S> * tensor degeneracy * the next most critical question for the cmb is whether the temperature fluctuations are scalar - mode only , or whether there could be a significant tensor signal . </S>",
    "<S> the tensor modes lack acoustic peaks , so they reduce the relative amplitude of the main peak at @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> a model with a large tensor component can however be made to resemble a zero - tensor model by applying a large blue tilt ( @xmath89 ) and a high baryon content . </S>",
    "<S> efstathiou et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) show that adding the 2dfgrs data weakens this degeneracy , but does not completely remove it . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable , since the 2dfgrs data alone constrain the baryon content weakly </S>",
    "<S> .    the importance of tensors will of course be one of the key questions for cosmology over the next several years , but it is interesting to consider the limit in which these are negligible . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> the standard model for structure formation contains a vector of only 6 parameters : @xmath90 . of these , the optical depth to last scattering , @xmath91 , is almost entirely degenerate with the normalization , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining four parameters are pinned down very precisely : using a compilation of pre - wmap cmb data plus the 2dfrgs power spectrum , percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) obtained @xmath92 or an overall density parameter of @xmath93 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable how well these figures agree with completely independent determinations : @xmath94 from the hst key project ( mould et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2000 ; freedman et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) ; @xmath95 ( burles et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives confidence that the tensor component must indeed be sub - dominant . </S>",
    "<S> for further details of this analysis , see percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) .    for flat models , </S>",
    "<S> there is a degeneracy that is related ( but not identical ) to the geometrical degeneracy , being very closely related to the location of the acoustic peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the angular scale of these peaks depends on the ratio between the horizon size at last scattering and the present - day horizon size for flat models : @xmath96 ( using the approximation of vittorio & silk 1985 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this yields an angle scaling as @xmath97 , so that the scale of the acoustic peaks is apparently almost independent of the main parameters .    however , this argument is not complete because the earlier expression for @xmath98 assumes that the universe is completely matter dominated at last scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the comoving sound horizon size at last scattering is defined by ( e.g. hu & sugiyama 1995 ) @xmath99 where vacuum energy is neglected at these high redshifts ; the expansion factor @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the values at last scattering and matter - radiation equality respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in practice , @xmath102 independent of the matter and baryon densities , and @xmath103 is fixed by @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the main effect is that @xmath105 depends on @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> dividing by @xmath106 therefore gives the angle subtended today by the light horizon as @xmath107,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 and @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkably simple result captures most of the parameter dependence of cmb peak locations within flat @xmath79cdm models . </S>",
    "<S> differentiating this equation near a fiducial @xmath110 gives @xmath111 in good agreement with the numerical derivatives in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( a15 ) of hu et  al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus for moderate variations from a ` fiducial ' model , the cmb peak multipole number scales approximately as @xmath112 , i.e. the condition for constant cmb peak location is well approximated as @xmath113 however , information about the peak heights does alter this degeneracy slightly ; the relative peak heights are preserved at constant @xmath55 , hence the actual likelihood ridge is a ` compromise ' between constant peak location ( constant @xmath114 ) and constant relative heights ( constant @xmath115 ) ; the peak locations have more weight in this compromise , leading to a likelihood ridge along approximately @xmath116 ( percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is now clear how lss data combines with the cmb : @xmath114 is measured to very high accuracy already , and percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> deduced @xmath117 with an error of about 6% using pre - wmap cmb data . </S>",
    "<S> the first - year wmap results in fact prefer @xmath118 ( spergel et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2003 ) ; the slight increase arises because wmap indicates that previous datasets around the peak were on average calibrated low .    in any case </S>",
    "<S> , the dominant error in @xmath55 and @xmath54 depends on what one chooses to add to the @xmath114 figure . </S>",
    "<S> the best approach given current knowledge is probably to combine the wmap @xmath118 with the updated 2dfgrs @xmath67 : this yields @xmath119 and @xmath120 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above conclusions were obtained by considering the shapes of the cmb and galaxy power spectra . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also of great interest to consider the amplitude of mass fluctuations , since a comparison with the galaxy power spectrum allows us to infer the degree of bias directly . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis was performed by lahav et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . given assumed values for the cosmological parameters </S>",
    "<S> , the present - day linear normalization of the mass spectrum ( e.g. @xmath121 ) can be inferred . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to define a corresponding measure for the galaxies , @xmath122 , such that we can express the bias parameter as @xmath123 in practice , we define @xmath122 to be the value required to fit a cdm model to the power - spectrum data on linear scales ( @xmath124 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of 2dfgrs galaxies in real space estimated by lahav et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) is @xmath125 , with a negligibly small random error . </S>",
    "<S> this assumes no evolution in @xmath126 , plus the luminosity dependence of clustering measured by norberg et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath121 for the dark matter can be deduced from the cmb fits . </S>",
    "<S> percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) obtain @xmath127 where the quoted error includes both data errors and theory uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the wmap value here is almost identical : @xmath128 , but no error is quoted ( spergel et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2003 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the unsatisfactory feature is the degeneracy with the optical depth to last scattering . </S>",
    "<S> for reionization at @xmath129 , we would have @xmath130 ; it is not expected theoretically that @xmath91 can be hugely larger , and popular models would place reionization between @xmath131 and @xmath132 , or @xmath133 ( e.g. loeb & barkana 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the many impressive aspects of the wmap results is that they are able to infer @xmath134 from large - scale polarization . </S>",
    "<S> taken at face value , @xmath135 would argue for reionization at @xmath136 , but the error means that more conventional figures are far from being ruled out . taking all this together , it seems reasonable to assume that the true value of @xmath121 is within a few % of 0.80 . given the 2dfgrs figure of @xmath137 </S>",
    "<S> , this implies that @xmath138 galaxies are very nearly exactly unbiased . </S>",
    "<S> since there are substantial variations in the clustering amplitude with galaxy type , this outcome must be something of a coincidence .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , this conclusion of near - unity bias was reinforced in a completely independent way , by using the measurements of the bispectrum of galaxies in the 2dfgrs ( verde et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2002 ) . as it is based on three - point correlations , </S>",
    "<S> this statistic is sensitive to the filamentary nature of the galaxy distribution  which is a signature of nonlinear evolution . </S>",
    "<S> one can therefore split the degeneracy between the amplitude of dark - matter fluctuations and the amount of bias .    even though a cdm - dominated universe matches the data very well </S>",
    "<S> , there are many plausible variations to consider . </S>",
    "<S> probably the most interesting is the neutrino mass : experimental data mean that at least one neutrino must have a mass of @xmath139  ev , so that @xmath140  the same order of magnitude as stellar mass .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.95    as explained in section 1 , a non - zero neutrino mass can lead to relatively enhanced large - scale power , beyond the neutrino free - streaming scale . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in figure 6 , taken from elgaroy et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . broadly speaking , allowing a significant neutrino mass changes the spectrum in a way that resembles lower density , so there is a near - degeneracy between neutrino mass fraction and @xmath19 ( figure  6b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a limit on the neutrino fraction thus requires a prior on @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> based on the cluster baryon fraction plus bbn , elgaroy et al . </S>",
    "<S> adopt @xmath141 ; together with the hst hubble constant , this yields a marginalized 95% limit of @xmath142 , or @xmath143  ev . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is the sum of the eigenvalues of the mass matrix : given neutrino oscillation results , the only way a cosmologically significant density can arise is via a nearly degenerate hierarchy , so this allows us to deduce @xmath144  ev for any one species .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have assumed that the vacuum energy is exactly a classical @xmath79 , or at any rate indistinguishable from one . </S>",
    "<S> this is a highly reasonable prior : there is no reason for the asymptotic value of any potential to go exactly to zero , so one always needs to solve the classical cosmological constant problem  for which probably the only reasonable explanation is an anthropic one ( e.g. vilenkin 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , dynamical provision of @xmath145 is not needed . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , one can readily take an empirical approach to @xmath146 ( treated as a constant for a frst approach ) .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.6    figure  7 shows a simplified approach to this , plotting the locus on @xmath147 space that is required for a given value of @xmath54 if the location of the main cmb acoustic peak is known exactly . for @xmath148 , </S>",
    "<S> this is very similar to the locus derived from the sn hubble diagram ( garnavich et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid circles show the updated 2dfgrs constraint of @xmath149 . in order to match the data with @xmath146 closer to zero , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 must increase and @xmath54 must decrease . </S>",
    "<S> the latter trend means that the hst hubble constant sets an upper limit to @xmath146 of about @xmath150 ( percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is very similar to the sne constraint of garnavich et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1998 ) , so the combined limit is already close to @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy is indeed looking rather similar to @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , an interesting aspect of figure  7 is that it reminds us of history . </S>",
    "<S> when the cobe detection was announced in 1992 , a popular model was ` standard ' cdm with @xmath28 , @xmath152 . as we see , this comes close to fitting the cmb data , and such a model is not unattractive in some ways . </S>",
    "<S> can we be sure it is ruled out ? </S>",
    "<S> leaving aside the sne data , one might think to evade the 2dfgrs constraint by altering the total relativistic content of the universe ( for example , by the decay of a heavy neutrino after nucleosynthesis ) . since 2dfgrs measures the horizon at matter - radiation equality , this will be changed . </S>",
    "<S> if the radiation density is arbitrarily boosted by a factor @xmath153 , the constraint from lss becomes @xmath154 therefore @xmath155 is required to allow an einstein  de sitter universe .    </S>",
    "<S> however , this argument fails , because it does not take into account the effect of the extra radiation on the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> as argued above , the location of the acoustic peaks depends on @xmath105 , which depends on @xmath156 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we change the radiation content , then what matters is @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the cmb peak constraint now reads @xmath158 when combining lss and cmb , everything is as before except that the effective hubble parameter is @xmath159 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a model with @xmath28 but boosted radiation would only fit the cmb with @xmath160 , and the attractiveness of a low age is lost . in any case , combining lss and cmb would give the same @xmath161 independent of @xmath153 , so it is impossible to save models with @xmath28 by this route .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is interesting to invert this argument . since percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) obtain an effective @xmath54 of @xmath162 and freedman et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) measure @xmath94 , we deduce @xmath163 this convincingly rules out the @xmath164 that would apply if the universe contained only photons , and amounts to a detection of the neutrino background . in terms of the number of neutrino species , </S>",
    "<S> this is @xmath165 . </S>",
    "<S> a more precise result is of course obtained from primordial nucleosynthesis , but this applies at a much later epoch , thus constraining models with decaying particles .    </S>",
    "<S> the beautiful data on the large - scale structure of the universe revealed in particular by the 2df galaxy redshift survey combine with the incredible recent progress in cmb data to show spectacularly good agreement with a ` standard model ' for structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> this consists of a scalar - mode adiabatic cdm universe with scale - invariant fluctuations . measuring the exact parameters of this model </S>",
    "<S> is rendered difficult by the intrinsic degeneracies of the structure - formation process , but progress is being made . </S>",
    "<S> the most recent data yield @xmath119 and @xmath120 ; these figures accord well with independent constraints , and it is very hard to believe that they are incorrect .    allowing extra degrees of freedom , such as massive neutrinos , vacuum equation of state @xmath166 , or extra relativistic </S>",
    "<S> content worsens the agreement with independent constraints on @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this both supports the simplest picture and allows us to set interesting limits on these non - standard ingredients .    for the future </S>",
    "<S> , we can look with anticipation to meaningful tests of inflation : the current data are consistent with @xmath8 to an error of @xmath167 . </S>",
    "<S> once this is halved , plausible levels of tilt will come within our sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the tensor fraction is a less clear target , but the motivation to improve on the current weak upper limits will remain strong .    </S>",
    "<S> it should of course not be forgotten that the large - scale structure we measure locally consists of galaxies . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the physics of galaxy formation has been sadly ignored , but this will be the increasing focus of lss studies : not just the global parameters of the universe , but the detailed understanding of how the complex structures around us formed . </S>"
