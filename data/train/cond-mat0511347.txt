    "the main purpose of this paper is a complete study of this equation below the critical temperature @xmath9 , in order to understand the dynamics of the formation of the condensate .",
    "our study is restricted to a spatially homogeneous system without interaction at arbitrary temperature .",
    "alternatively , the collapsing dynamics of a trapped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with attractive interaction is often analyzed in terms of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) or nonlinear schrdinger equation ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this describes the formation of a spatially inhomogeneous condensate at @xmath10 .",
    "the gp equation can display a self - similar collapse , but it occurs in position space while the system that we shall consider is spatially homogeneous and the condensation occurs in @xmath11-space .",
    "we thus consider a population of free bosons in @xmath12 dimensions with dispersion relation @xmath13 ( we set @xmath14 in the following ) .",

    "it is clearly comforting and satisfying that the theoretical dynamics modelizing the coupling to a thermal bath leading to equilibrium actually describes the evolution of out of equilibrium physical systems . however in _ quantum systems _ , it is not clear at all how to relate the simulation time ( number of world lines affected by the monte - carlo dynamics ) to the actual time . ]",

    "this approach has been extended to the case of intermediate statistics , associated to @xmath65 ( @xmath66 $ ] ) @xcite .",
    "it can be also generalized in order to recover tsallis statistical thermodynamics at equilibrium from a general kinetic equation @xcite .",
    "focusing on the bosonic case , we finally obtain the associated fokker - planck equation @xmath67 this bosonic kramers equation could be directly obtained from a modified langevin equation @xmath68 where the friction term which tends to move the momentum toward @xmath22 now increases with the occupation number at momentum @xmath11 . in this context , the origin of the bose - einstein instability is quite clear .",

    "our canonical description permits a complete analytical treatment for the different stages of the process , contrary to the microcanonical approach starting from the semi - classical boltzmann equation @xcite , where one has to mostly rely on numerical simulations .",
    "although qualitatively similar ( existence of a finite time pre - collapse regime for @xmath393 , scaling behavior of the density , formation of the condensate in the post - collapse regime ... ) , we note that our results differ quantitatively from the ones obtained within the microcanonical approach . for instance , @xmath394 in our canonical model , whereas @xmath395 in the microcanonical ensemble , where , numerically , one finds @xmath396 ( the difference is even more apparent on other quantities ) @xcite .",
    "this should not be surprising , as the same phenomenon arises in the study of the collapse dynamics of a self - gravitating gas , which is different in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles , though qualitatively similar in many respects @xcite .    in this paper",
