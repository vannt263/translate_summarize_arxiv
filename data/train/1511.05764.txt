    "in this paper we investigate non  perturbatively the relations between different two  point correlation functions in the scalar @xmath0 model from the point of view of statistical physics .",

    ", we find that all these correlation functions are asymptotically proportional to @xmath3 at large distances @xmath8 .",
    "although this result may seem to be very simple , it has some fundamental importance when we try to relate the results of the conformal field theory  @xcite with those , which can be obtained purely from statistical physics .",
    "we consider the continuous @xmath0 model in the thermodynamic limit of diverging volume @xmath9 with the hamiltonian @xmath10 given by @xmath11 where @xmath7 is the scalar order parameter , depending on the coordinate @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the temperature , @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant , whereas @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are hamiltonian parameters , which are functions of @xmath13 .",
    "it is assumed that there exists the upper cut - off parameter @xmath18 for the fourier components of the order - parameter field @xmath7 .",
    "namely , the fourier  transformed hamiltonian reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the only allowed configurations of @xmath7 are those , for which @xmath22 holds at @xmath23 .",
    "this is the limiting case @xmath24 of the model where all configurations are allowed , but hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hf ] ) is completed by the term @xmath25 .",
    "we consider also the lattice version of the scalar @xmath0 model with the hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a continuous scalar order parameter at the @xmath28-th lattice site with coordinate @xmath29 , and @xmath30 denotes the set of all nearest neighbors .",
    "the considered here versions of the @xmath0 model are standard and widely used in numerous analytical and numerical studies ",
    "see , e.  g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the critical behavior of the @xmath0 model  ( [ eq : h ] ) above the upper critical spatial dimension @xmath31 , i.  e. , at @xmath32 , is determined by the gaussian fixed point @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it means that the critical correlations functions at @xmath8 can be exactly calculated from the gaussian model with hamiltonian @xmath35    in the gaussian model , the correlation functions @xmath36 can be exactly calculated by coupling the variables according to the wick s theorem .",
    "the calculations can be performed either for fourier transforms or directly for the real  space correlation functions . in the latter case",
    ", one has to consider diagrams , constructed from one vertex with @xmath5 lines at coordinate @xmath37 and one vertex with @xmath6 lines at coordinate @xmath38 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath36 is given by the sum of all diagrams , obtained by coupling the lines .",
    "in this diagram technique , a line starting at coordinate @xmath37 and ending at coordinate @xmath38 gives the factor @xmath39 .",
    "a line can start and end at the same point , in which case it gives the factor @xmath40 for any @xmath12 .",

    "it means that @xmath46 holds at @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we conclude from eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrg ] ) that @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath3 at @xmath48 for positive odd integers @xmath5 and @xmath6 , whereas the asymptotic behavior is @xmath49 for positive even integers @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "this symmetry with respect to the argument @xmath79 does not hold for a fixed @xmath80 .",
    "it is quite natural to assume that this symmetry is broken in such a way that @xmath81 holds due to the interactions of ferromagnetic type in the @xmath0 model . indeed ,",
    "if a spin at a given coordinate is oriented up ( @xmath82 ) then it is energetically preferable and more probable that another spin at any finite distance @xmath83 from it is also oriented up , in such a way that the inequality  ( [ eq : condi ] ) is satisfied .",
    "according to the current knowledge about the critical phenomena , the two  point correlation functions are representable by an expansion in powers of @xmath83 at the critical point , and sometimes also the logarithmic corrections appear .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that @xmath77 can be expanded as @xmath84 at @xmath48 , where @xmath85 are the expansion coefficients , and the sum runs over pairs of indices @xmath86 belong to some set @xmath87 .",
    "let us @xmath88 correspond to the leading term .",

    "only the coefficients can depend on the particular lattice and crystallographic direction .",
    "moreover , the two  point correlation functions are isotropic at large distances @xmath48 , so that the asymptotic relation  ( [ eq : propto ] ) refers also to the lattice model , @xmath99 being isotropic .",
    "we have performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for the lattice @xmath0 model  ( [ eq : lattice ] ) in two dimensions .",

    "it is consistent with the well known @xmath135 asymptotic critical behavior in the models of 2d ising universality class .",

    "indeed , eq .  ( [ eq : corcft ] ) can not hold at @xmath166 in such a model , since finite @xmath18 ensures that the local quantities @xmath167 are also finite .    note that an exact power law is observed in the usual wilson  fisher renormalization in the wave  vector space , however , only for the fourier  transformed two  point correlation function @xmath168 .",

    "apparently , the absence of any length scale is a desired property in cft .",
    "unfortunately , the model without any cut  off is ill  defined , since the local quantities @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) are divergent . moreover , no mathematically justified calculations can be performed in this case even in the gaussian model because of the divergent quantity @xmath178 appearing in  ( [ eq : corrg ] ) .",
    "recall that a `` tadpole ''    ( 16,14 ) ( 8,0 ) ( 8,6 )    is formed when two lines of the same vertex are coupled , and it gives the factor @xmath178 .",
    "obviously , the free theory calculations at @xmath179 are performed in  @xcite , omitting the divergent diagrams with tadpoles in the gaussian model without any cut  off . only in this case",
    "we can obtain the reported in  @xcite results , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , after certain normalization of @xmath1 .",
    "such a subtraction of divergent terms is , in fact , a well known idea of the perturbative renormalization . from this point of view , the approach of  @xcite is neither rigorous nor really non  perturbative .",
    "we think that the only way how this formal cft can be justified is to find a strict relation between this formal treatment and the results of a well defined model .",
    "such possible relations are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pertest ] .",
    "another question is the validity of the `` equation of motion ''  ( [ eq : motion ] ) . in the @xmath0 model ,",
    "each configuration @xmath182 of the order parameter field @xmath7 shows up with the statistical weight @xmath183 $ ] , where @xmath184 is the partition function .",
    "therefore , it is impossible that a constraint of the form  ( [ eq : motion ] ) is really satisfied , unless any local violation of such a constraint leads to a divergent local hamiltonian density @xmath185 . to aware about this , we can consider a configuration @xmath182 , which obeys  ( [ eq : motion ] ) , and another configuration @xmath186 .",

    "if  ( [ eq : motion ] ) really holds , then the configuration @xmath186 must show up with a vanishing statistical weight as compared to that of @xmath182 , i.  e. , the above mentioned ratio must be zero",
    ". obviously , it is possible only if @xmath191 is divergent at least within a subregion of @xmath192 .    on the other hand , there are no evidences that the density of renormalized hamiltonian contains any term which is divergent if  ( [ eq : motion ] ) is violated .",
    "particularly , the usual perturbative approximations for the fixed  point hamiltonian in @xmath193 dimensions suggest that the renormalized hamiltonian is just the same as the bare one  ( [ eq : h ] ) with the only difference that the hamiltonian parameters have special , i.  e. , renormalized values . the density of such renormalized hamiltonian is finite for relevant field configurations with @xmath194 and @xmath195",
    "a standard way to compare the results of the lattice @xmath0 model to those of cft is to redefine operators of the lattice model . in particular",
    ", @xmath196 has to be replaced by @xmath197 , where an appropriate value of the constant @xmath198 is chosen to cancel the @xmath3 contribution contained in @xmath157 . in this case",
    ", the operator @xmath199 remains unaltered .",
    "we have verified perturbatively that the same method works also in the considered here continuous @xmath0 model with cut  off for wave vectors .",
    "namely , the perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath142 is such that the terms with @xmath200 ( and logarithmic correction factors ) cancel in @xmath202 and the terms with both @xmath200 and @xmath203 cancel in @xmath204 at the rg fixed point , if @xmath198 is chosen as @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the coefficient in  ( [ eq : propto ] ) .",
    "we have examined the corresponding expansion in powers of @xmath207 , @xmath119 and @xmath142 for the fourier transforms of these correlators , using the standard representation of @xmath168 by self - energy diagrams , to verify that the above mentioned cancellations take place in all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "it ensures that the expected @xmath208 asymptotic behavior of @xmath202 and the expected @xmath209 asymptotic behavior of @xmath204 can be , in principle , consistent with the perturbation theory , since @xmath210 at @xmath151 .",
    "we have tested also two  point correlators of odd operators @xmath211 , @xmath197 and @xmath212 .",
    "unfortunately , this method becomes problematic if operators @xmath213 with @xmath214 are included , since the number of required cancellations increase more rapidly than the number of free coefficients .",
    "note that terms with @xmath200 and @xmath203 have to be canceled in @xmath215 , terms with @xmath200 , @xmath203 and @xmath216 have to be canceled in @xmath217 , and terms with @xmath200 , @xmath203 , @xmath216 and @xmath218 have to be canceled in @xmath219 .",
    "we have found it already impossible to reach all the necessary cancellations up to the @xmath220 order for all two  point correlators of the above mentioned three operators @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "hence , the finding of a precise relation between a well  defined continuous @xmath0 model and the formal cft treatment of  @xcite is at least problematic within the perturbation theory .",
    "the details of our perturbative calculations are given in appendix .",
    "it is interesting to look for a possible non  perturbative relation between the discussed here formal cft and a well  defined model .",
    "the reported in  @xcite agreement of the results of the conformal bootstrap method with the known exact spectrum of the operator dimensions in the 2d ising model is a good evidence for the existence of such a relation in two dimensions .",
    "a nontrivial mc evidence for the existence of conformal symmetry in three dimensions has been provided in  @xcite .",
    "another interesting mc test has been performed in  @xcite to check whether or not relations for amplitudes of correlation lengths , analogous to those predicted by cft in the 2d ising model , can be found in the 3d ising model and , more generally , in the @xmath224symmetric models in three dimensions .",

    "the following judgment can be made : even if the conformal symmetry exists in the 3d ising model , then it is , however , questionable whether or not ( or in which sense ) the spatial dimensionality @xmath31 can be considered as a continuous parameter in the cft . on the other hand",
