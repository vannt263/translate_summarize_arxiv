    "a problem of major importance in solar and stellar magnetohydrodynamics is the determination of subsurface magnetic and thermal constitution of sunspots @xcite .",
    "application of time - distance helioseismology @xcite in 3-d tomographic imaging of subsurface layers of sunspots @xcite provided a major milestone in the seismology of sunspots @xcite .",
    "continuing developments in local helioseismology , notably helioseismic holography accompanied by theoretical modelling , have since identified several `` surface '' contributors to seismic measures , collectively known as `` surface magnetic effects '' @xcite , that arise from interactions of p modes with surface magnetic field of a sunspot .",
    "however , such interactions have so far not been explicitly included in helioseismic inversions , for lack of a suitable model , and hence relative contributions of surface and sub - surface perturbations have so far not been estimated .",
    "use of oscillation signals observed within sunspots is known to be the primary source of most surface effects in sunspot seismology @xcite , as well as the associated observational errors @xcite and systematics in the analysis procedure @xcite . in this letter , using waves with a first skip travel distance sufficiently larger than the diameter of sunspot under study , and employing deep - focus wave - path geometries that largely avoid wavefield observed within the sunspot , we present new time - distance helioseismic diagnostics that contrasts near - surface perturbations with deeper ones .",
    "signatures of a deep ( up to about a depth of 18 mm ) increased wave speed region , obtained using waves in deep - focus geometry are presented in section 3 .",
    "further support for this inference , from frequency dependences of surface- and deep - focus travel times , are presented in section 4 .",
    "a large sunspot ( noaa ar9057 , diameter @xmath0 32 mm ) that crossed the central meridian on 28 june , 2000 and observed by soho / mdi @xcite in the full - disk resolution mode has been chosen for this study . we extracted a data cube of size 373 mm@xmath1 by 1024 minute and have also obtained vector magnetograms of the same region observed by ivm instrument at hawaii ( hannah schunker , private communication ) .",
    "the data were pre - processed through the stanford data pipeline system to remap and track the region under study .    we choose waves having a first skip travel distance , @xmath2 , of 50 mm that is larger than the diameter of the sunspot . apart from a phase speed filter that selects waves with horizontal phase speed around 54 km / s with a width ( fwhm ) of 21.25 km / s , gaussian frequency filters centered around 2.5 , 3 , 4 and 5 mhz with widths of 1 mhz are also used to study frequency dependences of travel times @xcite .",
    "we employ three distinct measurement schemes ( figure 1 ) : ( i ) the traditional center - annulus surface focus geometry ( dotted lines ) , which , for the travel distance chosen , makes use of wave - field within sunspot either as a source ( out - going waves ) or as a receiver ( in - going waves ) but not both simultaneously , ( ii ) double skip center - annulus surface focus geometry , which completely avoids sunspot oscillation signals for measurements over a region of radius 43 mm from the spot center , and ( iii ) an annulus - annulus deep focus geometry with focus depths , @xmath3 , ranging from 10.24 - 17.65 mm ( solid and dashed lines correspond to @xmath3 = 16.85 and 17.65 mm , respectively ; details in section 2.1 ) .",
    "most studies have used the los magnetic field on the surface as a proxy for characterizing surface signal in the seismic measures @xcite .",
    "we note that , in the presence of a deep perturbation extending from the surface , surface magnetic field can be a proxy for neither the surface effects nor deeper perturbations in seismic signals individually and exclusively .",
    "since a seismic quantity , either a wave travel time or phase , measured at any single location ( pixel ) uses wave field observed at distant points that are spread over an annulus or pupil , a more appropriate proxy to characterize the surface effect would be similarly averaged surface magnetograms : weighted convolution of pupil functions , @xmath4 , ( or masks for center and annulus locations used to average the wave - field ) with the magnetograms , @xmath5 , given by , @xmath6 that gives each pixel a weighted average of surface magnetic field over all the pixels from where the wave - field used in a travel time measurement has come from ( figure 2 ) .",
    "weights , @xmath7 , for magnetic field at a given location ( @xmath8 ) is chosen to be the inverse of its horizontal distance , @xmath9 , from the focus point ( the measurement point,@xmath10 ) , because the density of rays or wave - paths projected on to the surface go as inverse distance from the focus .",
    "we use such reduced or averaged magnetograms , @xmath11 , to study any direct surface magnetic field induced variations in travel times .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath5 used here are los field strengths obtained from ivm vector magnetograms rescaled to mdi full - disk resolution .      two concentric annuli , centered around the point of measurement , are used in our typical deep - focus measurement scheme , similar to the original scheme proposed by @xcite : a point from the inner annulus is cross - correlated with a diametrically opposite point in the outer annulus , and all such point - to - point correlations spanning the whole annuli ( 360 degrees ) are averaged . in this scheme , the travel distance @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the radii of inner and outer annuli , respectively ; and , different focus depths are achieved by varying the ratio @xmath15 from 0 to 1 , while keeping @xmath2 fixed ; @xmath16 is the traditional surface focus , and @xmath17 is deep focus at the lower turning point .",
    "this latter case measurements were first performed by @xcite . here ,",
    "we perform 8 different focus depth measurements for the chosen @xmath18 mm , including the surface focus ; table 1 provides focus depths @xmath3 , for the chosen @xmath13 and @xmath14 , computed using ray theory for standard solar model ( model s of @xcite ) and corresponding umbral averages @xmath19 .",
    "& @xmath2 & 0 . & 60.0 + 6.25 & 43.75 & 10.24 & 43.0 + 10.0 & 40.0 & 13.12 & 29.0 + 12.5 & 37.5 & 14.53 & 20.0 + 18.75 & 31.25 & 16.85 & 6.5 + 21.43 & 28.57 & 17.35 & 4.0 + 22.22 & 27.78 & 17.45 & 3.7 + 25.0 & 25.0 & 17.65 & 3.0 +    for deep focus measurements over the entire area of sunspot to be completley free of wave - field within the sunspot , both @xmath13 and @xmath14 should be greater than diameter of the sunspot , i.e. @xmath2 should be greater than 64 mm ; but changes in travel times of waves with such large @xmath2 , as measured in local methods , are too small to analyse the effects under study .",
    "here , with @xmath18 mm , we aim at getting at least the measurements within umbral area to be free of wave - field within the sunspot , i.e. @xmath13 and @xmath14 should at least be the sum of umbral ( 5.8 mm ) and full sunspot radii ( 16 mm ) . from table 1 , we see that the last 3 ( deeper most ) annuli combinations roughly satisfy such a criterion ( see also figure 2 ) .",
    "in deep focus geometry , contribution of oscillation signals from within the sunspot to a given measurement , as characterized by @xmath20 , decreases as the focus depth increases ; passage to @xmath210 g ( table 1 and figure 2 ) occurs mainly in the umbral region , and so we study the variation of umbral averaged travel times against , @xmath22 , the umbral averaged @xmath20 ( umbral area is marked by the inner contour in figure 2a , and it is about 5.8 mm in radius ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the variation of changes , with respect to a quiet sun average , in umbral averages of one way ( in- and out - going ) and mean travel times , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , against @xmath22 .",
    "the error bars correspond to standard deviations of travel times over the umbral pixels .",
    "surface - focus geometry yields a value of @xmath26 g , and the corresponding travel times @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the two right most data points in figure 3 .",
    "umbral average of half of double skip travel times , @xmath29 , which have only a mean signal and are completely free of wave field within the sunspot ( cf .",
    "section 2 ) corresponding to a zero @xmath20 , is given by the dotted horizontal line .",
    "several important pieces of information about the sub - surface structure and interaction of p modes with the sunspot magnetic field are in order , in the variation of travel times against @xmath22 shown in figure 3 , once we understand the variation of measurement geometry and dependent sensitivities to travel times .",
    "firstly , because of geometry and the azimuthal averaging involved , the sensitivity to flows in deep focus measurements gradually decreases as @xmath3 increases and is zero when @xmath3 is the lower turning point for waves .",
    "this happens independent of @xmath20 . on the other hand , passage towards @xmath30 0",
    "g involves wave - paths changing from in and out of sunspot to that of crossing it at some depth . because of the above reasons , the asymmetric variation of one way travel times to a non - zero mean value of @xmath31 -10 .",
    "sec at @xmath320 g is accountable solely neither by material flow and its gradient in depth nor by effects localized near the surface due to predominant surface magnetic field interactions .",
    "an increased wave speed region extending down to , at least , a depth of about @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the horizontal wavelength of waves with dominant power within the frequency band used , is essential here . for the model s of @xcite the asymptotic relation ( ray theory ) @xmath35 yields a value of about 15 mm for frequency @xmath36=3.5 mhz and lower turning point @xmath37=18 mm , and",
    "so the increased wave speed region should extend at least to within 7.5 mm from the focus depth around 18 mm .",
    "this is broadly in agreement with early time - distance helioseismic inversions for sound speed @xcite , as far as the depth extent of positive sound speed changes is concerned .",
    "secondly , attributing the largely @xmath22 independent ( hence , focus depth independent ) values for @xmath23 ( @xmath38 -10 .",
    "sec . ) solely to seismic signals from flow and sound speed requires a following surprising coincidence : ( down)flow and sound speed perturbations both have negative depth gradients such that their signatures in @xmath23 ( ingoing waves travelling against the flow ) exactly cancel out , while those in @xmath24 ( outgoing waves travelling with the flow ) add up leading to the changes seen in figure 3 .",
    "frequency dependences of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , shown and discussed in the next section , however , argue against such a scenario .",
    "moreover , we find that half the double skip travel time @xmath29 ( -20 . sec . ) is closer to @xmath27 ( -11 .",
    "sec ) than to @xmath28 ( -35 .",
    "sec ) , confirming the early findings of @xcite .",
    "this result , again , depends on wave frequency as shown in the next section .    in summary ,",
    "results in figure 3 show that use of wave - field observed within magnetic regions with significant @xmath20 leads to travel time measurements that can not be explained solely in terms of seismic signals due to flows and sound speed",
    ". however , our measurements in the limit of @xmath320 g , where both surface magnetic and flow contributions go to zero , show a significant mean travel time signal indicating a faster wave speed region extending down to about 18 mm with a resolution uncertainty of @xmath39 7.5 mm .",
    "frequency dependence of mean travel times , over a sunspot region , was shown and interpreted by @xcite as an indication of perturbations largely confined to a region not deeper than a few mm . here , we show in figure 4 the umbral averages @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the deep focus times @xmath40 against frequency ; @xmath40 shown here are the ones averaged over the three deep most foci measurements ( table 1 ) .",
    "two important results concerning the sunspot - p mode interactions and deep structure of sunspot perturbations are contained in the frequency variations shown in figure 4 .",
    "( 1 ) there is a large asymmetry in the frequency dependences of @xmath27 and @xmath28 : dominant frequency dependence is seen only in @xmath27 , while that in @xmath28 is very small , for the chosen @xmath2 of 50 mm .",
    "a shallow sunspot perturbation can not introduce such a direction dependent frequency variation ; moreover , @xmath40 are largely independent of frequency .",
    "so , reasoning in the same lines as @xcite rather suggests a deeper extension for wave - speed perturbation , provided we identify an independent physical cause for the frequency dependence of @xmath27 , which we do in case ( 2 ) below .",
    "we note that for @xmath2 smaller than the diameter of sunspot , as is mostly the case in @xcite , and also from our results not discussed here , both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are equally frequency dependent .",
    "the asymmetric frequency dependence at larger @xmath2 , then , is likely due to source and receiver locations being outside or inside , but not both together within the spot : whenever waves from outside the spot are received inside , there is a large frequency dependence but no or little frequency dependence vice versa .",
    "\\(2 ) the mean times @xmath29 , which correspond to waves with both sources and recievers being outside but focussing at a first skip surface location within the spot , are not only closer to @xmath27 , but also have the same frequency dependence .",
    "this points to an intimate connection , helioseismically , between ingoing waves that survive the interaction with the sunspot to emerge on the other side and those observed or received within the sunspot : we interpret this as a helioseismic signature of well observed p mode absorption of sunspots .",
    "further , as evident in figure 4 , the lower the frequency the smaller is the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath27 . this might indicate that mode conversion is more efficient at lower frequencies , for a given phase speed , than at higher frequencies or to a wave - number dependent sunspot - p mode interaction .",
    "reliable three dimensional tomographic imaging of the whole depth range of sub - surface layers of a sunspot is hard to achieve without having to use waves skipping at distances smaller than the size of a sunspot and hence without explicitly taking into account the magnetic field - p mode interactions .",
    "since we lack a suitable model for such interactions and it has been quite clear from various studies ( @xcite and references therein ) that significant seismic contributions arise due to surface magnetic field interactions , physical , instrumental and systematic , most sunspot local seismic inversions have suffered from unreliable depth descrimination of flow and sound speed structures . here",
    ", we have attempted a completely heliosiesmic diagnostic approach to checking the extent of surface magnetic effects by way of combining of surface- and deep - focus time - distance helioseismic measurements that avoid oscillation signals observed within the sunspot .",
    "usian an appropriate surface magnetic field proxy , @xmath20 , derived from magnetograms , we have been able to contrast the near - surface perturbations with deeper ones .    even though we have not proved that deep - focus measurements indeed have maximum sensitivities localized enough at the foci , with wave propagation calculations ( which should form part of a future investigation ) , we believe that results presented in sections 3 and 4 together provide strong observational evidences for an extended depth region of faster wave propagation beneath sunspots .",
    "large asymmetry of one way travel times of waves focussing near the surface within a sunspot ( i.e. when the surface magnetic field contribution is high ) is also shown to be accompanied by asymmetric frequency dependence .",
    "we have identified such direction and surface magnetic field ( or focus depth ) dependent changes in frequency dependence of travel times to be helioseismic signatures of p mode absorption and mode conversion .",
    "the surface magnetic proxy @xmath20 that we have defined in eqn.(1 ) depends only on how oscillation signals on the surface are used in a given measurement and so should prove useful in characterizing surface magnetic effects in different methods of local helioseismology .",
