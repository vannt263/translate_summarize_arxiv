    "3 shows the fraction of configurations learning the xor rule versus the number of learning steps for different values of the plastic adaptation strength @xmath42 .",
    "we notice that the larger the value of @xmath42 the sooner the system starts to learn the rule , however the final percentage of learning configurations is lower .",
    "the final rate of success increases as the strength of plastic adaptation decreases .",
    "this result is due to the highly non linear dynamics of the model , where firing activity is an all or none event controlled by the threshold .",
    "very slow plastic adaptation allows then to tune finely the role of the neurons involved in the propagation and eventually recover the right answer .",
    "moreover , very slow plastic adaptation also makes the system more stable with respect to noise , since too strong synaptic changes may perturb excessively the evolution hampering the recovery of the right answer .",
    "the dependence of the learning success on the plasticity strength is found consistently for different values of the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath45 and @xmath15 , where a higher percentage of success is observed in systems with no inhibitory synapses .",
    "moreover , the dependence on the plastic adaptation @xmath42 is a common feature of all tested rules .",
    "data indicate that the easiest rule to learn is or , where a 100% percentage of success can be obtained . and and xor present similar difficulties and lead both to a percentage of final success around 80% , whereas the most difficult rule to learn is the ran rule with three inputs where only 50% of final success is obtained .",
    "this different performance is mainly due to the higher number of inputs , since the system has to organized a more complex path of connections leading to the output site .",
    "the most striking result is that all rules give a higher percentage of success for weaker plastic adaptation .",
    "indeed this result is in agreement with recent experimental findings on visual perceptual learning , where better performances are measured when minimal changes in the functional network occur as a result of learning @xcite .",
    "we characterize the learning ability of a system for different rules by the average learning time , i.e. the average number of times a rule must be applied to obtain the right answer , and the asymptotic percentage of learning configurations .",
    "this is determined as the percentage of learning configurations at the end of the teaching routine , namely after @xmath46 applications of the rule .",
    "4 shows that the average learning time scales as @xmath47 for all rules and independently of parameter values .",
    "since some configurations never learn and do not contribute to the average learning time , we also evaluate the median learning time which exhibits the same scaling behaviour as the average learning time . the asymptotic percentage of success increases by decreasing @xmath42 as a very slow power law , @xmath48 .",
    "since this quantity has a finite upper bound equal to unity , this scaling suggests that in a finite , even if very long , time any configuration could learn the rule by applying an extremely slow plastic adaptation .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a larger fraction of systems with no inhibitory synapses finds the right answer and the average learning time for these systems is slightly shorter .",
    "we understand this result by considering that for only excitatory synapses the system more easily selects a path of strong enough synapses connecting inputs and output sites and giving the right answer .",
    "conversely , the presence of inhibitory synapses may lead to frustration in the system as not all local interactions contribute in the optimal way to provide the right answer and the system has to find alternative paths .",
    "we check this scaling behaviour by appropriately rescaling the axes in fig .",
    "3 . the curves corresponding to different @xmath42 values indeed all collapse onto a unique scaling function .",
    "similar collapse is observed for the or , and and ran rules and for different parameters @xmath31 , @xmath45 and @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , two different cases of distributions of inhibitory synapses , one in which they are chosen randomly among all synapses , the other where certain randomly chosen neurons have all outgoing synapses inhibitory , provide equivalent results .",
    "the learning dynamics shows therefore universal properties , independent of the details of the system or the specific task assigned .",
    "the learning behaviour is sensitive to the number of neurons involved in the propagation of the signal , and therefore depends on the distance between input and output neurons and the level of connectivity in the system .",
    "we then investigate the effect of the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath45 on the performance of the system .",
    "5 shows the percentage of configurations learning the xor rule for different minimum values of the neuron out degree .",
    "systems with larger @xmath45 have a larger average number of synapses per neuron , producing a more branched network .",
    "the presence of several alternative paths facilitates information transmission from the inputs to the output site .",
    "however , the participation of more branched synaptic paths in the learning process may delay the time the system first gives the right answer . as expected the performance of the system improves as the minimum out - connectivity degree increases , with the asymptotic percentage of success scaling as @xmath49 .",
    "the dependence of the learning performance on the level of connectivity is confirmed by the analysis of systems with different number of neurons @xmath3 , the same out - degree distribution and the same set of parameters .",

    "the percentage of learning configurations after @xmath46 applications is found , as expected , to decrease as @xmath51 and similar behaviour is detected for the or , and and ran rules .",
    "the existence of systems that are unable to learn , even after many learning steps , raises intriguing questions about the learning dynamics .",
    "we question what happens when a second chance is given to the configurations failing the right answer .",
    "we then restart the learning routine after imposing a small change in the initial configuration of voltages .",
    "this small perturbation leads to about 25% more configurations learning the rule .",
    "the initial state of the system can therefore influence the ability to learn , especially for complex rules as xor or ran . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of the out - degree distribution in configurations which did and did not give the right answer indicates that  dumb \" configurations tend to have less highly connected nodes than the   smart \" ones .",
    "namely , giving repeatedly wrong positive answers leads to pruning of several synapses .",
    "this affects in particular the highly connected neurons , which have a crucial role in identifying the right synaptic learning path .",
    "finally we test the ability of the configurations that do learn to remember the right answer once the initial configuration is changed .",
    "the memory performance of the system is expected to depend on the intensity of the variation imposed , namely on the extension of the basin of the attraction of states leading to the right answer .",
    "the system is able to recover the right answer in more than 50% of the configurations if a very small perturbation ( of the order of @xmath52 ) is applied to all neurons or else a larger one ( of the order of @xmath53 ) to 10% of neurons .",
    "the system has a different memory ability depending on the rule : almost all configurations remember or , whereas typically 80% remember and and at most 70% the xor rule .",
    "in conclusion , we investigate the learning ability of a model able to reproduce the critical avalanche activity as observed for spontaneous activity in _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ cortical networks .",
    "the ingredients of the model are close to most functional and topological properties of real neuronal networks .",
    "the implemented learning dynamics is a cooperative mechanism where all neurons contribute to select the right answer and negative feedback is provided in a non - uniform way . despite the complexity of the model and the high number of degrees of freedom involved at each step of the iteration , the system can learn successfully even complex rules as xor or a random rule with three inputs .",
    "in fact , since the system acts in a critical state , the response to a given input can be highly flexible , adapting more easily to different rules .",
    "the analysis of the dependence of the performance of the system on the average connectivity confirms that learning is a truly collective process , where a high number of neurons may be involved and the system learns more efficiently if more branched paths are possible .",
    "the role of the plastic adaptation strength , considered as a constant parameter in most studies , provides a striking new result : the neuronal network has a  universal \" learning dynamics , even complex rules can be learned provided that the plastic adaptation is sufficiently slow . this important requirement for plastic adaptation",
