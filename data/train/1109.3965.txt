    "most interesting effects take place when one of the coupling coefficients depends _ linearly _ on electric field . for instance , simple models based on electronic @xcite or lattice mediated polarization @xcite predict that the dm vector is electric - field dependent according to @xmath11 ; this gives rise to the phenomena of magnetically induced ferroelectricity observed in a large class of materials , the cycloidal multiferroics @xcite .    in addition , the linear magnetoelectric effect makes magnetic excitations electrically dipole active .",
    "this gives rise to the electromagnon , the quasiparticle of the multiferroic state @xcite .",
    "the observation of electromagnons in optical experiments provide invaluable clues on the symmetry and magnitude of the magnetoelectric coupling present in eq .",

    "optical experiments have also produced a puzzling observation : _ the lower energy electromagnon , unlike the higher energy one , survives also in the collinear sinusoidal phase_. this is observed , e.g. , in dymno@xmath1 @xcite , gd@xmath18tb@xmath19mno@xmath1 @xcite , and eu@xmath13y@xmath20mno@xmath1 @xcite , but in tbmno@xmath1 no electromagnons are discernible in the sinusoidal phase @xcite .    currently , there exists a consensus that the high energy electromagnon originates from magnetostriction , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ fme ] ) @xcite . however , no consensus exists on the origin of the low energy electromagnon .",
    "two quite different models were proposed for its explanation : in [ ] , we showed that magnetostriction plus spin - orbit coupling is able to explain the origin of both electromagnons even when the cycloid ground state is purely harmonic . in [ ] , mochizuki _ et al .",
