    "discretization of characters of irreducible finite dimensional representations of any compact simple lie group @xmath16 was introduced in general in @xcite . at the time it was motivated by the need to solve large computational problems in lie theory .",
    "a quarter of century later the motivation would rightfully be called processing of digital data from lattices of any dimension , density , and symmetry .",
    "large computations made it a practical imperative to replace the basis of irreducible characters by the basis of constituents of the characters that are symmetric with respect to the weyl group denoted here @xmath1-functions . unlike the characters , @xmath1-functions are firmed as sums of limited number of exponential terms .",
    "it is perhaps curious to note that such a discretization was made possible only after publication of three papers during the few years preceding @xcite .",
    "they were the following : ( i ) a concise description all conjugacy classes of elements of finite order in any @xmath16 in @xcite , then ( ii ) after it became possible to decompose even the extremely large characters into the sum of the sum of constituent @xmath1-functions @xcite , and finally ( iii ) after the computation of character values of elements of finite order in @xmath16 became practical @xcite .",
    "the discretization of the skew - symmetric @xmath2-functions in @xcite follows an analogous path .",
    "the @xmath1- and @xmath2-functions appear in the weyl character formula @xcite .",
    "the functions have been known , for more than half a century , as different constituent of the character @xcite .",
    "they are well known for the uniformity of their properties across the compact simple lie groups of any type , in particular their continuous orthogonality when integrated over a finite region @xmath5 of the real euclidean space , and their discrete orthogonality when summed up over a lattice fragment in @xmath5 of any density @xcite . in the specific case of @xmath0",
    ", they were described in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the aim of this paper is to confirm for the simple lie group @xmath0 , the existence and properties of two additional families of special functions denoted @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "existence of such functions was first noticed , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . ] in @xcite for the group @xmath20 .",
    "all four families of functions are obtained by a summation of exponential terms over the weyl group @xmath21 of @xmath0 .",
    "they are refereed to as orbit functions . in 1-dimension ,",
    "when the underlying group is the rank one simple lie group @xmath22 ( equivalently @xmath23 ) , the @xmath1- and @xmath2-functions become the common cosine and sine functions , while @xmath3- and @xmath4-functions have no analog there .",
    "we point out in the paper that the families of @xmath3- and @xmath4-functions do not exist for the group @xmath24 ( equivalently @xmath25 ) .    the history of the functions of the families @xmath3 and @xmath4 is short . it was noted in @xcite that the 2-variable antisymmetric cosine and symmetric sine can be obtained by summation of appropriate exponential functions over the weyl group @xmath26 of the simple lie group @xmath20 . since @xcite is a special case of @xcite , where the @xmath27-variable symmetric and antisymmetric sine and cosine were defined , the families of @xmath3- and @xmath4-functions could have been noted already in @xcite in the context of the simple lie groups @xmath28 of any rank .",
    "the present paper is thus the first to describe the families @xmath3 and @xmath4 of orbit functions outside of the symmetric and antisymmetric generalizations of trigonometric functions , their symmetries are more complicated .",
    "most recently it was shown that the four families of orbit functions exist for all compact simple lie groups with two root lengths @xcite .",
    "the new results of the paper , which are the properties of @xmath3- and @xmath4-functions of @xmath0 , are brought together and compared with the properties of the @xmath0-orbit functions of all four families .",
    "the second goal of the paper is to describe the properties of the new families of orbit functions when they are discretized , that is when their values are sampled on a lattice fragment @xmath29 .",
    "it turns out that the functions within families @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are orthogonal when summed up over the same finite fragment @xmath30 of the lattice in @xmath5 of any density specified by @xmath31 .",
    "although the same grid @xmath30 may be used for each family , the appropriate weight functions are different .",
    "that makes the functions of either family suitable for expansion of 2-dimensional digital data .",
    "this has been known for over two decades @xcite and used in some very large computations , for example in @xcite .",
    "it is also known for @xmath2-functions @xcite . for @xmath3 and @xmath4 types .",

    "a product of a pair of orbit functions contains either 144 or 72 or 36 exponential terms which can be rewritten as half as many trigonometric function terms .",
    "the information is then used to find the recurrence relations for the orbit functions .",
