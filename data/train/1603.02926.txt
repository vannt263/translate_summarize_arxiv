    "the common idea is to show the strict concavity of the potential @xmath7 on the convex hull of @xmath3 ( the location of @xmath8-centers ) .",
    "but , using _ alexandrov s reflection principle _ or the _ moving plane method _ ( @xcite ) , we can restrict a region containing all @xmath8-centers smaller than the convex hull of @xmath3 .",
    "we call such a small region the _ minimal unfolded region _ of @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath33 , which was introduced by ohara in @xcite",
    ". when @xmath3 is a convex body , in @xcite , the minimal unfolded region was independently defined by brasco , magnanini and salani as the _ heart _ of @xmath3 denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "hence , in order to show the uniqueness of a @xmath8-center , it is sufficient to show the strict concavity of @xmath7 on the minimal unfolded region .",
    "the minimal unfolded region @xmath33 is made by the following procedure : fix a direction @xmath35 and a parameter @xmath36 ; let @xmath37 denote the reflection of @xmath0 in the hyperplane @xmath38 ; by @xmath39 , we denote the set of all points in @xmath3 whose height in the direction @xmath40 are not smaller than @xmath41 ; we repeat to fold the set @xmath42 by the reflection @xmath37 and to gradually decrease the value @xmath36 until the image is stick out from @xmath3 ; let @xmath43 be the _ minimum folding height _ for @xmath40 , that is , put @xmath44 define the minimal unfolded region of @xmath3 by @xmath45 for example , in @xmath46 , the minimal unfolded region of the union of the two same - sized discs @xmath47 is the line segment @xmath48 .",

    "hence it seems difficult to give a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of an @xmath1-center for @xmath58 .",
    "our main result in this paper is a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of a @xmath8-center implying the examples ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "precisely , if the kernel @xmath8 satisfies the condition @xmath59 for some @xmath29 ( which is detailed in section 2 ) , and if @xmath60 is increasing , then the body of revolution @xmath61 where @xmath62 \\to [ 0,+\\infty ) $ ] is a piecewise @xmath63 function with @xmath64 concave , has a unique @xmath8-center .",
    "this result immediately implies the uniqueness of an @xmath1-center of the body ( [ revolution_omega ] ) for @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , using the same manner as in the above result , we also show that a non - obtuse triangle in @xmath46 has a unique @xmath8-center if @xmath60 is increasing .",
