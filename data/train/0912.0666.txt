    "electromagnetic energy can be focused and guided below the light diffraction limit by transforming it into a collective plasmonic excitation , the surface plasmon polariton , that can propagate along a one dimensional array of nanoparticles ( nps ) @xcite .",

    "previous works have already addressed the question of how to achieve a high degree of localization of plasmonic excitations @xcite and have studied the plasmon propagation on the waveguide formed by an ordered np chain @xcite . however",
    ", a fundamental question remains open : how to transform a _ localized _",
    "excitation into a strong signal somewhere else inside a finite chain .",
    "a natural idea , would be to exploit the divergent local density of states of 1-d systems , _",
    "i.e. _ the vanishing group velocity at the band edge , as proposed for light buffering in photonic waveguides baba - photonic .",
    "however , such divergences are a bulk property absent in finite and semi - infinite chains , where the local density of states near the extremes cancels out at the passband edge . in a quantum tight - binding model",
    ", this corresponds to a semi - elliptical density of states .",
    "therefore , the only alternative would seem to tailor the surface inhomogeneity to generate ad - hoc resonances @xcite that could easily be excited and transfer energy .",
    "this poses a big challenge for both experiments and numerical simulations , since there is a broad range of parameters to be explored .",
    "thus , this work resorts to a model that , containing only essentials , could be solved analytically by using a response function formalism . besides the expected _ resonant _ and _ localized _ eigenmodes , we find an elusive regime of _ virtual _ states .",
    "this appears when the resonance width collapses and before becoming a localized state , providing for a continuity between them .",
    "quite surprisingly , we prove that _ virtual _ to _ localized _ states transition provides the route to optimal excitation transfer by recovering , at the chain extremes , a divergent local density of states with slow group velocity . the work is organized as follow : in section ii we present the model used to describe the system and develop a response function formalism and a pole analysis for it .",
    "then , in section iii we show and discuss the results , and finally , in section iv we summarize the main conclusions of the work .",

    "[ ldps ] ) .",
    "an excitation at this frequency will remain indefinitely within the localization length @xmath94 .",
    "these two situations would typically exhaust the analysis .",
    "however , for quantum systems it has recently become clear that the transition between these two regimes , although covering a very narrow parametric range , has subtle and unique properties : there is a real pole  which nevertheless does not correspond to an eigenstate of the system ( see @xcite ) . as such",

    "[ alfac1 ] and alfac2 .",
    "consistently with the above discussion , an appreciable transfer occurs in the _ resonant _ state regime .",

    "note that the optimal configuration for excitation transfer does not occur for @xmath117 and @xmath118 where the le - np is indistinguishable from the others , as one might navely expect .",
    "instead , it occurs for the highly asymmetric configuration where a _",
    "virtual_-_localized _ transition appears .  in this case , an excitation of a local mode that is coupled to collective excitations at the band edge , has components with very slow group velocity . in consequence , under a continuous irradiation , the excitation can build up .",
    "this dynamical interpretation is consistent with the new strategy developed in the context of photonic crystals .",
    "there , waveguides with slow group velocities are used as a way of buffering light@xcite .",
    "alternatively , one sees that just at the _",
    "virtual_-_localized _ transition , the spectroscopic eq . [ dn0 ] favorably combines its three factors : the response function on the excited nanoparticle @xmath119  has a high intensity peak , this peak is inside the passband , and the relative effective coupling @xmath120  is strong . _",
    "_    notice that a high transfer efficiency could be achieved even for @xmath89 so different from @xmath121 that the system could never form a _",

    "a strong interaction with the substrate captures a state from the continuum spectrum to build a second _ localized _ state that would constitute the antibonding  orbital of a dimer nordlander .",
    "this occurs through a _",
    "virtual_-_localized _ transition and thus leads to the optimal excitation transfer shown in fig [ dfase ] .",
    "experimentally , these critical points could be achieved byproperly tuning the distance , radius , shape and material of the nps .",
    "additionally , this configuration acts as a very narrow filter for the external frequency in resonance with the passband edge ( see fig .",
    "ejemplos - rvl - b).the control of this critical phenomenon opens up many possibilities for applications .",
    "for example , the extreme sensibility of excitation transfer on @xmath122 when the system is close to a critical transition , would enable a new form of plasmon ruler suitable for biological and chemical applications @xcite .",
    "this occurs because @xmath57 varies with @xmath123 and , depending on @xmath89 , @xmath121 and @xmath124 which give the frequency offset of fig .[dfase ] , the system response sweeps through different regimes within a narrow interval of @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , as small changes on the refractive index modify dramatically the coupling @xmath124 and hence the passband , the excitation transfer will also be extremely sensitive to the dielectric environment in a system tuned with the _",
    "virtual_-_localized _ transition .",
    "we have demonstrated that , contrary to common wisdom , the highest excitation transfer does not occur for a system with a well defined resonance but when a _ virtual _ state is transformed into a _ localized _ collective plasmonic mode whose eigenfrequency is just at the passband edge .",
    "the slow group velocity of an excitation with this critical frequency enables the excitation buffering and hence favors a strong signal inside the chain . the extreme sensitivity of this transition to the waveguide and le - np parameters would provide new tools for plasmonics . as the basic model is quite general ,",
