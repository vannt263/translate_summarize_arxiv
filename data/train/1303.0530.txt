    "in the standard cosmic ray model , most cosmic ray electrons are from supernova remnants while the cosmic ray positrons are mainly produced through hadronic processes as cosmic ray protons collide with intergalactic hydrogen @xcite . in conventional approach ,",
    "the injection spectrum of electrons ( positrons ) is taken as a single power - law . since diffusion and electron / positron cooling",
    "are more efficient in higher energies , the spectrum should soften with energy and the positron - to - electron ratio ( i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the flux ) should drop with energy monotonously @xcite . hence there should be no prominent feature at tev energies in cosmic ray electron / positron total spectrum , neither in the positron - to - electron ratio .",
    "the situation has changed dramatically since 2008 .",
    "the advanced thin ionization calorimeter ( atic @xcite ) , polar patrol balloon - borne electron telescope with scintillating fibers ( ppb - bets @xcite ) , the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess @xcite ) and fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat @xcite ) reported cosmic ray electron / positron total spectrum up to tev and found a hardening / bump in the energy range from 100 gev to 1 tev . almost simultaneously the payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ( pamela ) discovered an unambitious rise of the positron - to - electron ratio above @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "such a peculiar rising behavior has been confirmed by fermi - lat though in an indirect way @xcite .",
    "people call the well - established electron / positron total spectrum hardening / bump and the increasing positron - to - electron ratio , unexpected in the standard model , the excesses or anomalies .",
    "these interesting features draw a lot of attention , and various physical origins , in particular new astrophysical sources and new physics ( dark matter ) , have been extensively explored ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "very recently , the ams-02 collaboration has released their first result on positron fraction in cosmic rays , which confirms the positron excess with unprecedented accuracy up to the energy @xmath7 gev @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the protons and helium are the most abundant cosmic - ray components , and the spectrum of these cosmic - rays up to the so - called  knee \" can be described by a single power law @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the spectra of protons ( helium ) measured by atic @xcite , cosmic ray energetics and mass ( cream @xcite ) and pamela @xcite show a remarkable hardening at the magnetic rigidity @xmath0 several hundred gv ( gev / nucleon ) .",
    "we call such a kind of spectrum hardening the cosmic ray nuclei excesses , which challenge the current paradigm of cosmic - ray acceleration and propagation in the galaxy .",
    "various interpretations have been put forward , such as the spectrum superposition of the local source and the background @xcite , the non - linear acceleration of cosmic rays @xcite , and superposition of the injection spectra of the cosmic ray sources @xcite . instead of performing an advanced study of the possible physical origin of the nuclei excesses , in this work",
    "we simply take such observational indication ( i.e. , the hardening of the cosmic ray proton and helium spectra above @xmath8 gv @xcite ) as the main motivation to consider the possibility that the primary electron spectrum gets hardened .",
    "this work is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the possibility that the primary electron spectrum gets hardened and then investigate the observational signature . in section iii we take the latest ams-02 positron ratio data to set new bounds on the dark matter models and to constrain the possible primary electron spectrum hardening .",
    "the implication on the physical origin of the cosmic ray nuclei excesses is also investigated .",
    "we summarize our results with some discussion in sec .",
    "the cosmic - ray electron spectrum is connected to the proton spectrum for two good reasons @xcite : ( 1 ) the electrons propagate in the galaxy in the same magnetic fields as nuclei ; ( 2 ) some , if not all , cr electrons are produced by the same sources as nuclei .",
    "the nucleon injection spectrum has a hardening at a magnetic rigidity @xmath9 gv , it is thus natural to assume a spectrum hardening of the primary electrons injected from supernova remnants ( hereafter we call such primary electrons the _ background _ ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors attributed _ all _ the @xmath10 excesses at energies @xmath11 gev to the background spectrum hardening but found that the positron - to - electron ratio is not possible to reproduce ( see their fig.12 and fig.13 ) .",
    "we instead suggest that the spectrum hardening of the background electrons just accounts for _ part of _ the @xmath10 excesses detected by current instruments . with the given electron / positron total spectrum detected by ( for example ) fermi - lat , _",
    "the spectrum hardening of the background electrons inevitably leads to the softening of the rest  additional component \" which has been widely assumed to consist of electron and positron pairs .",
    "hence the increasing behavior of positron - to - electron ratio should be shallower than that in the absence of a spectrum hardening .",
    "_ such a modification is of our interest since a reliable estimate of the physical parameters of the  additional component \" emitter ( from either dark matter annihilation / decay or pulsars ) to address the excesses is not achievable if the background spectrum hardening has not been properly taken into account .",
    "the rigidity ( @xmath12 ) at which the possible electron spectrum hardening presents is hard to reliably estimate , so is the change of the spectral index of primary electrons ( @xmath13 ) . in general",
    ", _ the energy and magnitude of the hardening do not have to be the same for electrons and protons _ since the electron - to - proton ratio may vary with energy and with source type @xcite .",
    "however based on current cosmic ray data one may be able to have some reasonable speculation .",
    "for example , the magnitude of the hardening of primary - electron spectrum may be within the range of @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , as reported for proton ( helium ) cosmic rays @xcite . in the diffusive - reacceleration model ,",
    "the fit to the cosmic ray data with galprop requires a spectrum softening at the magnetic rigidity @xmath16 gv for all nucleons but @xmath17 gv for electrons @xcite . since the injection spectrum of nucleons gets hardened at @xmath18 gv , the spectrum hardening of the background electrons could present _ for example _ at @xmath19 gv though other values are possible .",
    "if the hardening is caused by the injection spectrum of the cosmic rays , the background electron spectrum still gets softened at energies above @xmath20 gev due to the synchrotron and inverse compton energy losses of high energy electrons . a nearby source ,",
    "if plays a key role in producing the nuclei excesses , can also give rise to a non - ignorable primary electron spectrum hardening since the cooling during the travel is far more crucial in modifying the spectrum for electrons than the nuclei . throughout this work",
    "we assume that the hardening of the background spectrum takes place only once . at least in principle",
    "multiple spectrum hardening is possible .",
    "the ams-02 data to be released in a few months can shed valuable light on such a kind of possibility .",
    "dark matter is a form of matter necessary to account for gravitational effects observed in very large scale structures such as the flat rotation curves of galaxies and the gravitational lensing of light by galaxy clusters that can not be accounted for by the amount of observed / normal matter @xcite .",
    "the most widely discussed candidate is the so - called weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which may annihilate with each other or decay and then produce particle pairs such as photons , electrons and positrons and so on @xcite .",
    "that is why dark matter may be able to account for the observed positron and electron excesses , as extensively examined in the literature @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the positron excess detected by pamela / fermi - lat / ams-02 may be mainly contributed by pulsars .",
    "high energy electrons / positrons may be generated through the cascade of electrons accelerated in the magnetosphere of pulsars @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of @xmath21 injected to the galaxy from pulsars can be parameterized as a broken power - law with the cutoff at @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 , where @xmath22 ranges from several tens gev to higher than tev and the power - law index @xmath24 ranges from 1 to 2.2 depending on the gamma - ray and radio observations @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of pulsars is parameterized as @xcite @xmath25\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|z|}{z_s}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath26 kpc is the distance of solar system from the galactic center , and @xmath27 kpc is the scale height of the pulsar distribution .",
    "the other parameter appearing in the above equation is the normalization factor @xmath28 that will be determined in our data fit .    in the latest modeling",
    "the most widely adopted data include the pamela electron spectrum @xcite , the fermi - lat electron + positron spectrum @xcite , and the ams-02 positron fraction data @xcite . since these data were collected by different instruments , the systematic errors are hard to estimate . at energies",
    "@xmath29 gev , the fermi - lat _ standard _ electron + positron flux ( i.e. , the  standard high energy selection data \" ) reported in @xcite is below the pamela electron flux @xcite . in a recent paper to estimate the positron - to - electron ratio , with the updated instrument response functions taking into account",
    " ghost events \" the fermi - lat collaboration also presented the electron / positron total spectrum in the energy range @xmath30 gev @xcite , which seems to be more consistent with the pamela electron spectrum . at energies",
    "@xmath31 gev , the difference of the electron + positron spectra between fermi - lat and atic might be partly due to the very different path length of the detectors . to check such a possibility",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration has performed a dedicated analysis in which they selected events with the longest path lengths in the calorimeter .",
    "two additional requirements for these events are that they do not cross any of the boundary gaps between calorimeter tower modules and they have sufficient track length in the tracker for a good direction reconstruction @xcite .",
    "for such an event sample , the spectrum seems to be a bit harder than that obtained in the standard high energy selection ( see fig.19 of @xcite for a comparison ) though the consistence is well in view of the relatively large systematic errors . considering these facts , in this work we model two sets of data separately , including ( i ) the fermi - lat _ standard _ electron + positron flux data @xcite and the ams-02 positron fraction data @xcite ; ( ii ) the fermi - lat long path electron + positron spectrum data presented in @xcite , the updated fermi - lat electron + positron spectrum in the energy range @xmath30 gev @xcite , the pamela electron spectrum data @xcite , and the ams-02 positron fraction data .    as already mentioned before",
    ", the electron excesses could originate from either dark matter annihilation / decay or pulsars and the background electrons might display significant spectrum hardening .",
    "we try to jointly fit the electron / positron total spectrum and the positron - ratio data in the following scenarios , including ( a ) background without spectrum hardening + dark matter annihilation / decay into @xmath32 ; ( b ) background without spectrum hardening + pulsars ; ( c ) background with spectrum hardening + dark matter annihilation / decay into @xmath32 ; ( d ) background with spectrum hardening + pulsars . for the second set of data",
    ", we will also fit the data in the model of  background with spectrum hardening + pulsars + dark matter annihilation into @xmath33 \" ( i.e. , scenario ( e ) ) .",
    "the electrons traveling in the galaxy suffer from inverse compton scattering of interstellar background photons ( e.g. , cosmic microwave background , dust emission and star light ) and boost these photons to gev energies , becoming part of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "hence the galactic diffuse emission detected by space telescopes can be used to reliably constrain the physical parameters of dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "the latest bounds set by the fermi - lat galactic diffuse emission data are presented in @xcite . to make use of such bounds , our dark matter density distribution profiles as well as the cosmic ray diffusion parameters",
    "are taken to be the same as that adopted in @xcite .",

    "@xmath38 kpc and @xmath39 kpc are two scale radii . throughout this work ,",
    "nfw ( iso ) profile is adopted to probe the dark matter decay ( annihilation ) scenario . as a result of the significant cooling of the high energy electrons",
    ", only the relatively nearby electrons / positrons can reach the earth .",
    "hence the result of modeling electron / positron data does not depend on the dark matter distribution profile sensitively .",
    "however , very tight constraint on the dark matter annihilation scenario has been set by the galactic diffuse emission and the nfw profile is strongly disfavored .",
    "we adopt the galprop @xcite package to numerically calculate the propagation of the cosmic ray particles , including both those from astrophysical sources and the contribution from dark matter annihilation or decay .",

    "to reasonably fit the data , two codes have been developed .",
    "one is based on the minuit ( http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/ ) and the other is based on the cosmomc ( http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/ ) . in most cases the former can provide a very - quick and reasonable ( i.e. , @xmath47 , where d.o.f is the degree of the freedom ) fit of the data . however the obtained fit parameters are usually not the  best \" and reliable estimates of the parameter spaces are not achievable . the latter can provide us the best fit parameters but is very time - consuming .",
