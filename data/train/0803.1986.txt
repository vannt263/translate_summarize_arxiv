    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been used as a _ calibrated _ candle to probe the dynamics of the universe , leading to a significant progress in cosmology , i.e. the determination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "they are believed to be thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "however the nature of their progenitors has remained unclear , and this still raises doubts as to the calibration which is purely empirical and based on the nearby sn ia sample . based on the characteristics of observed sne ia ( e.g. light curves , chemical stratification ) , it seems most likely that they occur when the accreting co wds reach the chandrasekhar limit , and sub - chandrasekhar models appear not to be consistent with the observations of sne ia .",
    "chandrasehar - mass wds can be created through the single - degenerate scenario , where the co wd accretes mass from a non - degenerate companion @xcite , or the double degenerate scenario , where two co wds with a total mass larger than the chandrasekhar mass coalesce @xcite .",
    "recent observations indicate that there is a wide spread of delay time between star formation and sn ia explosion , and this imply that there exist two populations of progenitors , a `` prompt '' one with a delay time less than @xmath2 and a `` tardy '' one with a delay time of @xmath3 @xcite .    using the archival data prior to explosion from hubble space telescope ( hst ) and _ chandra _",
    ", @xcite tried to search for a possible progenitor of sn2007on ( type ia ) in elliptical galaxy ngc 1404 .",
    "they discovered an object at the position of sn2007on .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the object and the non - detection in the optical images are fully consistent with the single - degenerate scenario , and the the discovery therefore favours the single - degenerate scenario",
    ". however , new _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations @xcite and detailed astrometry of the site of sn2007on showed that there appears to be an offset between the sn and the x - ray source , and the offset means a small probability ( @xmath4 ) of the x - ray source being related to the sn .",
    "however , the x - ray source is not unconnected with the sn , as the x - ray source has dimmed after the explosion and the source before the explosion showed an excess of soft x - ray photons relative to the other sources in the field .",
    "kepler s 1604 supernova is suggested to be of type ia .",
    "@xcite made a deep _ chandra _ observation of kepler s supernova remnant and concluded that kepler s sn is a sn ia with circumstellar medium ( csm ) interaction .",
    "this might indicate that the progenitor is a massive ( young ) star .",
    "@xcite searched hst pre - explosion images for ngc 1316 , a radio galaxy in the fornax cluster and a prolific producer of sne ia , for evolved intermediate - mass progenitor stars .",
    "the pre - explosion images ( 3 years before explosion ) of the sites of sn2006dd ( a normal sn ia ) and sn2006mr ( likely a subluminous sn ia ) show no potential luminous stellar progenitors .",
    "more effort is still needed in identifying the progenitors of sne ia .    among various possible progenitor models ,",
    "the wd+ms channel of the single - degenerate scenario is the most widely accepted one , in which a co wd accretes mass from its main - sequence ( ms ) star or a slightly evolved subgiant in a close binary system until it reaches a mass of @xmath5 and explodes as a sn ia @xcite .",
    "the companion star should survive the explosion and show distinguishing properties , and it is therefore a promising method to test progenitor models by identifying the surviving companion stars of sne ia .",
    "tycho brahe s 1572 supernova is a galactic sn ia .",
    "@xcite found in the remnant region that tycho g , a star similar to the sun but with a lower gravity , moves at more than three times the mean velocity of the stars there .",
    "they argued that tycho g could be the surviving companion of the supernova .",
    "indeed , a surviving companion would have a high space velocity and evolve to a wd finally , and the single - degenerate scenario could potentially explain the properties of halo wds observed by @xcite , e.g. their space density and ages @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argued that the ultra - cool wds observed by @xcite might have been formed via the single - degenerate scenario , i.e. they might be the remnants of the non - degenerate donor stars .",
    "note , however , there have been no conclusive proof yet that any individual object is the surviving companion of a sn ia .",
    "@xcite did detailed binary evolution calculations for part of the wd+ms channel of the single - degenerate scenario , and presented the properties , e.g. orbital velocities , luminosities , effective temperatures , of the companion stars at the moment of sn ia explosion for the sample wd binaries they studied , in which the roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) starts when the companion star is in ms .",
    "however , the distributions of the properties have not been obtained .",
    "@xcite run a monte carlo scenario code to calculate the distributions of masses , luminosities and velocities of the companion stars of sne ia .",
    "however , they have not done detailed binary evolution calculations for the production of sne ia , and this results in big uncertainties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , e.g. the orbital velocities obtained for the companion stars from the wd+ms channel are over 450 km / s , which is far too high .",
    "* hereafter hp04 ) carried out detailed binary evolution calculations for the wd+ms channel for about 2300 close wd binaries , in which rlof starts when the companion star is in ms or in hertzsprung gap ( i.e. slightly evolved ) .",
    "the study is comprehensive , and various properties of the companion stars were obtained but not sorted for publishing . in this _",
    ", i extract the properties from the data files of the calculations and incorporate them into the latest version of the binary population synthesis ( bps ) code developed for the study of various binary - related objects @xcite , including the progenitors of sne ia @xcite , and obtain the distributions of the properties .",
    "in the single - degenerate scenario , the progenitor of a sn ia is a close wd binary system , which has most likely emerged from common envelope ( ce ) evolution @xcite of a giant binary system . during the ce evolution , the envelope engulfs",
    "the core ( here a co wd ) of the giant and the secondary , and the orbital energy released in the spiral - in process ( i.e. orbital decay ) is used to overcome the binding energy of the ce in order to eject it . for the ce evolution",
    ", i have two parameters : @xmath6 the ce ejection efficiency , i.e.  the fraction of the released orbital energy used to overcome the binding energy , and @xmath7 , which defines the fraction of the thermal energy contributing to the binding energy of the ce . as in previous studies ,",
    "i adopted @xmath8 , which gives good matches between theory and observations for many binary - related objects .",
    "prescription , but appears to be more physical . see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for details . ]    to obtain the distributions of properties of companion stars at the moment of sn explosion , i have performed a detailed monte carlo simulation with the latest version of the bps code . the code follows the evolution of binaries with their properties being recorded at every step .",
    "if a binary system evolves to a wd+ms system , and if the system , at the beginning of the rlof phase , is located in the sn ia production regions in the plane of ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) for its @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the orbital period , the secondary s mass and the wd s mass of the wd+ms system at the beginning of the rlof ( see fig . 3 of hp04 ) , i assume that a sn ia is resulted , and the properties of the wd binary at the moment of sn explosion are obtained by interpolation in the 3-dimensional grid ( @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 ) of the @xmath13 close wd binaries calculated in hp04 .    in the simulation ,",
    "i follow the evolution of 100 million sample binaries according to grids of stellar models of metallicity @xmath14 and the evolution channels leading to sne ia as described in hp04 .",
    "i adopted the following input for the simulation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "( 1 ) the star - formation rate ( sfr ) is taken to be constant over the last 15gyr .",
    "( 2 ) the initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite is adopted .",
    "( 3 ) the mass - ratio distribution is taken to be constant .",
    "( 4 ) the distribution of separations is taken to be constant in @xmath15 for wide binaries , where @xmath16 is the orbital separation .",
    "( 5 ) the orbits are assumed to be circular .",
    "the simulation gives current - epoch - snapshot distributions of many properties of companion stars at the moment of sn explosion , e.g. the masses , the orbital periods , the orbital separations , the orbital velocities , the effective temperatures , the luminosities , the surface gravities , the surface abundances , the mass transfer rates , the mass loss rates of the optically thick stellar winds .",
    "the simulation also shows the initial parameters of the primordial binaries and the wd binaries that lead to sne ia .",
    "figs  [ vm]-  [ nm ] are selected distributions that may be helpful to identify the progenitors of sne ia .",
    "figs  [ vm ] and  [ tg ] are the distributions of the masses , the orbital velocities , to @xmath17 for a corresponding companion star s mass of @xmath18 to @xmath19 at the moment of sn explosion . ] the effective temperatures and the surface gravities of companion stars at the moment of sn explosion .",
    "tycho g was taken as the surviving companion star of tycho brahe s 1572 supernova by @xcite .",
    "it has a space velocity of @xmath20 , more than 3 times the mean velocity there .",
    "its surface gravity is @xmath21 , while the effective temperature is @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters are compatible with figs  [ vm ] and  [ tg ] . as from our simulation , the recorded properties at each step show that a primordial binary system with a primary mass @xmath23 , a secondary mass @xmath24 and an orbital period @xmath25 would evolve to a close wd binary system with a wd mass @xmath26 , a secondary mass @xmath27 , and an orbital period @xmath28 .",
    "the wd binary results in sn ia explosion with companion parameters ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 actually ) in the range of tycho g.    however , figs  [ vm ] and  [ tg ] are for that at the moment of sn explosion , the distributions could be modified due to the explosion .",
    "@xcite presented several high - resolution two - dimensional numerical simulations of the impacts of sn ia explosion with companions .",
    "the impact make the companion in the wd+ms channel lose a mass of 0.15 - 0.17@xmath31 , and receive a kick of 49 - 86@xmath32 .",
    "@xcite adopted the simple analytic method of @xcite , and calculated the impact to survey the influence of the initial parameters of the progenitor s systems . with detailed stellar models and realistic separations that were obtained from binary evolution",
    ", they obtained an even lower stripped mass , 0.03 - 0.13@xmath31 , but a similar kick velocity 30 - 90@xmath32 , which is perpendicular to the orbital velocity .",
    "a surviving companion star therefore has a mass lower by @xmath33 and a space velocity larger by @xmath34 than that in fig .",
    "[ vm ] .",
    "the companion stars are out of thermal equilibrium at the moment of sn explosion .",
    "the equilibrium radii are typically larger by @xmath35 than that at the moment of sn explosion .",
    "therefore the surface gravity at equilibrium should be lower than that in fig .",
    "@xcite systematically explored the evolution and appearance of a typical companion star that has been stripped and heated by the supernova interaction during the post - impact re - equilibrium phase . such a star may be significantly overluminous or underluminous . fig .",
    "[ tg ] could be a starting point for further studies of this kind .",
    "[ pm ] is the distribution of orbital periods of the wd+ms systems at the moment of sn explosion .",
    "if i assume that the companion stars co - rotate with their orbits , i obtain their distributions of equatorial rotational velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ vrotm ] ) .",
    "we see that the surviving companion stars are fast rotators and their spectral lines should be broadened noticeably .",
    "[ dmm ] shows the distribution of masses lost during optically thick stellar wind phase .",
    "we see that a significant amount of mass is lost in the wind .",
    "@xcite found that the wind with a velocity above @xmath36 , which is believed to be reasonable , would excavate a large low - density cavity around its progenitor .",
    "however , the fundamental properties of seven young sn ia remnants ( kepler , tycho , sn 1006 , 0509 - 67.5 , 0519 - 69.0 , n103b and sn 1885 ) obtained by @xcite are incompatible with such large cavities . a lower wind velocity or the consideration of wd rotation could help to solve the problem @xcite .",
    "[ dmdtm ] presents the distribution of mass transfer rates at the moment of sn explosion .",
    "the mass transfer rates can be converted to x - ray luminosities of the systems by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 gives the approximate amount of energy obtained per gram of hydrogen burnt into helium or carbon / oxygen .",
    "the luminosity of the x - ray source close to the site of sn 2007on ( 4 years before the explosion ) was estimated to be @xmath39 @xcite , corresponding to a mass accretion rate of @xmath40 , which is consistent with fig .  [ dmdtm ] .",
    "qu carinae , a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) , is suspected to be a sn ia progenitor .",
    "it has a wd mass of @xmath41 , a once - reported orbital period of @xmath42 , and more importantly , a very high mass transfer rate of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "these properties are consistent with figs  [ pm ] and  [ dmdtm ]",
    ". however , bf eridani , another cv with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite , appears not to be a sn ia progenitor .",
    "[ nm ] is the distribution of the surface nitrogen mass fraction of companion stars at the moment of explosion .",
    "we see that nitrogen can be significantly overabundant ( with corresponding underabundance of carbon due to the cn - cycle ) .",
    "however , the surface can be seriously polluted by the ejecta of sn explosions .    the simulation in this _",
    "letter _ was made with @xmath8 . if i adopt a lower value for @xmath7 , say , 0.1",
    ", the birth rate of sne ia would be higher ( a factor of 1.7 ) and the delay time from the star formation to sn explosion is shorter .",
    "this is because that binaries resulted from ce ejections tend to have shorter orbital periods for a small @xmath7 and are more likely to locate in the sn ia production region ( see fig.3 of hp04 ) .",
    "the companion stars with orbital velocity @xmath46 would be absent from fig .  [ vm ] , and the ones with @xmath47 would be absent from fig .",
    "this is due to that wd binaries with long orbital periods are absent due to a small @xmath7 .",
    "the distributions are snapshots at current epoch for a constant sfr . for a single star burst",
    ", most of the sn explosions occur between 0.1 and 1gyr after the burst ( see fig . 7 of hp04 ) .",
    "the evolution of progenitor properties with time can be understood via fig .",
    "3 of hp04 .",
    "a delay time from 0.1 to 1gyr corresponds to @xmath10 of @xmath48 to @xmath49 , and to @xmath11 of @xmath41 to @xmath50 for the wd+ms system , respectively . as seen from fig .",
    "3 of hp04 , the range of the orbital periods becomes narrower from a delay time of 0.1 to 1.0gyr .",
    "those wd binaries result in sn ia explosions via rlof .",
    "consequently , the range of progenitor properties at the moment of sn ia , e.g. the orbital velocities of companion stars , the surface gravities , the equatorial rotational velocities , the mass transfer rates , becomes narrower with time .",
    "the mass transfer rate would be smaller with time as @xmath51 becomes smaller .",
