    "these two antagonist aspects of nonlinearity of a frictional interface explain the existence of a distinguished value of the normal stress that maximizes energy dissipation : @xmath131 0.4 in figure [ fam7]a .",
    "the numerical simulations allow us to explore dependence on parameter values describing the contact interface ( displacement , normal and tangential stresses , sliding distance , ... ) .",
    "figure [ fam7]b shows the tangential stress and displacement of the contact node situated on the interface at @xmath8 = 0 mm versus time .",

    "the numerical model takes into account a slip - weakening friction law that includes @xcite the combined effects of static and dynamic friction , with coefficients @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",

    "the evolution of the third harmonic as well as of the dissipated energy depends on two aspects : on the cumulative sliding distance during the transmission of the shear wave and on the friction coefficient . when a sw friction law is taken into account ,",
    "the maximum values of third harmonic magnitude and of the dissipated energy are achieved for a larger value of the applied normal stress @xmath132 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the static effect in the sw law delays the interface sliding in comparison with the case @xmath148 .",
    "less sliding and @xmath149 both imply lower values of dissipated energy and of third harmonic .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are as follows : + ( i ) there exists a specific value of the normal stress that maximizes energy dissipation .",

    "the maximal value is obtained for a larger value of @xmath132 .",
