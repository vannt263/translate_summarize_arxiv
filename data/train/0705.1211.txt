    "einstein equations in their original form , with an energy - momentum tensor for standard matter on the right hand side , can not account for the observed accelerated expansion of our universe .",
    "the late time acceleration of the universe , which is directly supported by supernovae observations , and also indirectly , through observations of the microwave background , of the large scale structure , weak lensing , and baryon oscillations , poses one of the most important challenges to modern cosmology . the standard lore aimed at capturing this important effect",
    "is related to the introduction of the energy - momentum tensor of an exotic matter with large negative pressure ( _ dark energy _ ) in the einstein equations .",
    "the simplest known example of dark energy ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) is provided by the cosmological constant .",
    "this does not require any _ adhoc _ assumption for its introduction , as is automatically present in the einstein equations , by virtue of the bianchi identities .",
    "the field theoretic understanding of @xmath1 is far from being satisfactory .",
    "efforts have recently been made to obtain @xmath1 in the framework of string theory , what leads to a complicated landscape of de - sitter vacua .",
    "it is hard to believe that we happen to live in one of the @xmath2 or more vacua predicted by the theory@xcite .",
    "one might take the simplified view that , like @xmath3 , the cosmological constant @xmath1 is a fundamental constant of the classical general theory of relativity and that it should be determined from large scale observations .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the @xmath4 model is consistent with the observations at present .",
    "unfortunately , the non - evolving nature of @xmath1 leads to a non - acceptable fine - tuning problem .",
    "we do not know how the present scale of the cosmological constant is related to planck s or the supersymmetry breaking scale ; perhaps , some deep physics is at play here that escapes our present understanding .",
    "the fine - tuning problem , associated with @xmath1 , can be alleviated in scalar field models which do not disturb the thermal history of the universe and can successfully mimic @xmath1 at late times .",
    "a variety of scalar fields have been investigated to this end@xcite ; some of them are motivated by field / string theory and the others are introduced owing to phenomenological considerations .",
    "it is quite disappointing that a scalar field description lacks predictive power ; given _ a priori _ a cosmic evolution , one can always construct a field potential that would give rise to it .",
    "these models should , however , not be written off , and should be judged by the generic features which might arise from them .",
    "for instance , the tracker models have remarkable features allowing them to alleviate the fine - tuning and coincidence problems .",
    "present data are insufficient in order to conclude whether or not the dark energy has dynamics ; thus , the quest for the metamorphosis of dark energy continues .",
    "the other alternative for getting accelerated expansion is related to modifications of the geometry itself or the left hand side of the einstein equations .",
    "there are several ways of modifying gravity ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "higher dimensional ( including stringy ) effects might lead to large - scale modifications of gravity .",
    "another approach , which is largely motivated by phenomenological considerations , is related to the modification of the form of the gravitational action ( like @xmath5 gravity , etc ) .",
    "the third intriguing alternative is provided by the higher order curvature corrections to einstein gravity due to low - energy ( super)string effective action @xcite . the leading order correction in the string expansion parameter @xmath6",
    "is given by a gauss - bonnet term which has several remarkable features and which was proposed as a dark energy model @xcite .",
    "the next - to - leading corrections , cubic and quartic in the curvature , crucially depend upon the type of string model under consideration .",
    "the higher - order curvature invariants are coupled to scalar ( dilaton / modulus ) fields .",
    "one might try to fix these fields by invoking some non - perturbative mechanism . in that case",
    ", the gb term does not contribute to the four - dimensional equations of motion .",
    "however , the higher order curvature terms contribute in this case .",
    "their presence crucially modifies the fate of a phantom dark energy universe . since it is difficult to realize any scenario with a fixed dilaton or modulus field , the analysis involving dynamically evolving fields becomes very important .",
    "a number of papers@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) are devoted to the possibility of having dark energy with a gb term and a dilaton / modulus field with non - trivial potential .",
    "a steep exponential potential exhibits a scaling solution which mimics the background ( matter / radiation ) ; the nucleosynthesis constraint is satisfied provided the slope of the potential is large@xcite .",
    "the scaling solution describes a decelerating universe .",
    "it is surprising that the gb term can cause a transition from the matter dominated era to a dark energy universe and it can also lead to transient phantom energy , provided the slope of the exponential potential and the dilaton coupling to the gb invariant are chosen properly @xcite , or a more complicated choice of scalar potentials is done @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario with the exponential potential , it is quite difficult to satisfy the nucleosynthesis constraint and , secondly , the coupling also becomes very large .",
    "since the introduction of the dilaton potential needs assumptions about some non - perturbative mechanisms and the massless dilaton naturally arises in the string loop expansion of the low energy effective theory , it is important to explore the possibility of a dark energy solution with a massless dilaton . to this effect , the second order curvature correction was considered in ref .",
    "this , next - to - leading correction contains a higher order euler density which identically vanishes for space - time dimensions less than six ; the other remaining term is a curvature invariant of order three .",
    "the model can lead to a stable dark energy solution .",
    "it is interesting to note that the third order correction in @xmath6 crucially depends on the type of string theory model . in this paper",
    "we incorporate string loop corrections up to order three in @xmath6 to the einstein - hilbert action with a massless dilaton .",
    "we investigate the cosmological dynamics of the model and explore whether a particular string type is actually sensitive to the existence of dark energy .",
    "we also outline a general prescription of the construction of the de - sitter solution in presence of higher order curvature invariants coupled to the dilaton field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we set up the general evolution equations from string effective lagrangian which incorporates curvature corrections , up to order four in @xmath7 , coupled to a dynamically evolving massless dilaton . in section",
    "iii , we explore the viability of a dark energy solution for models based upon type ii , heterotic and bosonic strings in the framework of a perturbative string theoretic set up .",

    "the friedmann equation is reduced to [ ds5 ] 0=v_0 + 3x - 12 c_2 ^2 x^3 . by eliminating @xmath172 from ( [ ds4 ] ) and ( [ ds5 ] ) , one obtains [ ds6 ] 0=3v_0 + 8x + 8c_1 x^2  . on the other hand , by eliminating @xmath174 from ( [ ds4 ] ) and ( [ ds5 ] ) , we get [ ds7 ] 0=-1 + 8c_1  x + 36 ^2 c_2 x^2  . and by further eliminating the @xmath175 term from ( [ ds6 ] ) and ( [ ds7 ] ) , we find [ ds8 ] x = x_0  . this expression for @xmath176 is not always a solution of the two independent equations ( [ ds4 ] ) and ( [ ds5 ] ) , or equivalently ( [ ds6 ] ) and ( [ ds7 ] ) . the condition for @xmath176 in ( [ ds7 ] ) to be a solution can be obtained by substituting the expression ( [ ds8 ] ) into ( [ ds6 ] ( or equivalently ( [ ds7 ] ) ) : [ ds9 ] 0=24v_0(c_1 ^ 2 - 4c_2)^2 + 8(12c_2 v_0 + c_1 ) ( c_1 ^ 2 - 4c_2 ) + c_1 ( 12c_2 v_0 + c_1)^2 . in the particular case",

    "( [ ds9 ] ) has the following form : [ ds10 ] 9c_1 ^ 2=32 c_2  , and ( [ ds8 ] ) gives [ ds11 ] x_0==-  .",
    "therefore , if @xmath178 , there is a possibility that there could occur a de - sitter space solution .",
    "we should note that , even if the solution exists , the hubble rate @xmath136 itself can not be determined uniquely .",
    "in fact , since [ ds12 ] h=^p_0/_0  , by choosing @xmath179 properly , the value of @xmath136 itself could be arbitrarily changed .",
    "then the value of @xmath136 could be determined by the initial condition .",
    "hence , we have presented in the above the condition to be satisfied by the coefficients of our effective action , which leads naturally to a de - sitter universe . in other words , if this condition is fulfilled , the early - time and ( or ) late - time universe can be inflationary ( non - singular ) due to stringy effects .",
    "it goes without saying that , again , the stability of such de - sitter universe should be checked in each case , as it was done for the bosonic string earlier .",
    "in this paper we have considered string loop corrections to the einstein - hilbert action given by ( [ stcor ] ) , with a dynamical dilaton @xmath9 .",
    "we have explored the cosmological dynamics of the corresponding modified gravity in the framework of a low - energy string effective action . for simplicity",
    ", we have ignored the contribution of the background ( radiation / matter ) energy density .",
    "the higher - order string corrections to gravity , specially the third - order correction in @xmath6 , crucially depend upon the string type .",
    "the evolution equations are quite involved and it is difficult to analyze them in general . taking a different route , we have conjectured a particular solution , @xmath180 , @xmath181 for @xmath45[@xmath182 , @xmath183 when @xmath47 ] .",
    "this solution is important from the dark - energy viewpoint ; we have carefully checked its viability by enforcing a consistency check on the parameters of the solution .",
    "this consistency requirement constraints the range of the parameter @xmath51 , which defines the effective equation of state .",
    "the model based upon a type ii string turned out to be the simplest to investigate semi - analytically .",
    "the possible range of @xmath51 in this case is given by @xmath97 corresponding to an uninteresting equation of state ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "type ii is clearly ruled out because the string expansion parameter can not be negative .",
    "nevertheless , the situation might be improved in presence of matter .",
    "it would also be interesting to examine the fate of a phantom universe in presence of higher curvature corrections with a massless dilaton .",
    "in the case of the heterotic string , the dark energy solution exists for @xmath51 varying as @xmath185 , which corresponds to @xmath186 .",
    "wmap@xmath187 data analyzed with the snls survey constraints the dark energy equation of state as @xmath188 at the @xmath81 confidence level , which puts the heterotic string model under pressure",
    ". however , the combined ( cmb+snls+lss ) data forces the dark energy equation of state parameter to vary as @xmath189 .",
    "thus , the heterotic string is only marginally compatible with observations .",
    "cosmological dynamics based upon the bosonic string turn out to be distinguished amongst all possible string types .",
    "indeed , the consistency of the model leads to an effective equation of state given by @xmath190 , which is clearly compatible with data .",
    "the stability analysis is difficult to carry out in this case , in general .",
    "we have studied the de - sitter case ( @xmath191 ) in the bosonic case separately and demonstrated its stability .",
    "a more general action , with higher - curvature corrections coefficients depending on a dilaton was also considered .",
    "the general reconstruction method could be developed for such theory , so that a realistic universe expansion history can be obtained within some class of scalar potentials .",
    "an example which proposes a matter - dominance era before cosmic acceleration ( quintessence , phantom era or @xmath4 cosmology ) is presented .",
    "the de - sitter universe in such a general theory ( as well as for the bosonic string ) can arise quite naturally .",
    "it is known that , with the addition of a scalar - gauss - bonnet term only , the low - energy string effective action can indeed help in the resolution of the initial singularity problem @xcite .",
    "the appearance of de - sitter solution in the general case with higher curvature corrections clearly indicates that the resolution of an initial and/or a final singularity of any type ( for the classification of future , finite - time singularities , see @xcite ) could be possible taking into account higher - order string loops .",
    "we conclude that it is not so easy to get the natural dark energy universe from a low - energy string effective action ( at the very least up to @xmath0 corrections ) .",
    "it could turn out that use of even higher order terms is necessary , or that the consideration of a different compactification might lead to a more realistic universe . in this respect",
    ", it could be expected that taking into account stringy non - perturbative effects might help .",
    "for instance , one future possibility is to consider not only higher curvature corrections but also to include negative powers of such terms ( an inverse @xmath6 expansion ? ) like in the models with positive and negative powers of the curvature@xcite .",
