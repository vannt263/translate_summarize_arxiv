    "atmospheric , solar and terrestrial neutrino oscillations experiments provided evidence for neutrino oscillations . the atmospheric neutrino data analysis confirmed the @xmath9 channel as the dominant atmospheric oscillation solution .",
    "the results of the terrestrial experiment kamland and the results of sno salt phase prefer flavor oscillation lma solutions to the @xmath0 one for the solar neutrino problem .",
    "active - sterile neutrino oscillations are discussed as a supplementary sub - dominant channel . even after the confirmation of lma solution as a dominant solution of the solar neutrino problem ,",
    "the oscillation parameters are not precisely known - the completeness of lma solution was questioned and the scope for some possible sub - dominant transitions was explored @xcite .",
    "the available results of the neutrino oscillations from the solar experiments , including the later sno es , cc and nc data , slightly favor the existence of a small sterile oscillating sector .",
    "thus , it is still interesting to explore the cosmological influence of sterile oscillating neutrinos .",
    "neutrino @xmath0 oscillations affect the expansion rate and the neutrino involved processes in the early universe and in particular , influence big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .",
    "this allows to put stringent constraints on neutrino @xmath0 oscillations from bbn considerations .",
    "the whole lma and partially low @xmath0 solar oscillation solutions and atmospheric @xmath0 solution were excluded by cosmological considerations @xcite .",
    "detail reviews discussing neutrino role in cosmology and neutrino masses and mixings may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "cosmological constraints were obtained usually assuming zero sterile neutrino state population before neutrino oscillations epoch , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the equilibrium electron neutrino energy density . however , sterile neutrinos production is predicted by different types of models , like gut models , models with large extra dimensions , many - fold universe models , mirror matter models , neutrino oscillations models , etc . , and may be present at the onset of bbn epoch .",
    "hence , the degree of population of @xmath1 and its initial energy spectrum distribution depends on the @xmath1 production model , and in general @xmath12 .",
    "the general case of initially ( before oscillations ) non - zero sterile neutrino population was examined and its influence on the oscillation effects at bbn epoch was discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "it was found that _ the kinetic effect of oscillations is sensitive to the initial population of @xmath1_. bbn constraints on neutrino oscillations parameters in the general case of sterile neutrino state , partially occupied initially , were discussed in reference @xcite for oscillations effective after electron neutrino decoupling .",
    "the case of @xmath13 @xmath3he overproduction was considered . _",
    "the presence of non - empty sterile neutrino @xmath14 before oscillations was shown to lead to strengthening of the cosmological constraints proportional to the @xmath8 value_.    recent studies of the systematic uncertainties of primordial @xmath3he abundance suggest as a more reliable value of @xmath3he observational uncertainty @xmath15 . in what follows we derive 5.2@xmath16 cosmological constraints , corresponding to @xmath15 @xmath3he overproduction on @xmath0 oscillation parameters for the same type of non - equilibrium neutrino oscillations .",
    "we show that in contrast to @xmath13 @xmath3he constraints , _ in the @xmath15 case the non - zero initial sterile population leads to a relaxation of the constraints on oscillation parameters proportional to the value of @xmath8 _ , and finally to their alleviation for @xmath17 .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss briefly the primordial @xmath3he production in the case of non - zero sterile population at the start of oscillations . in the last section we present the cosmological constraints corresponding to @xmath3he - overproduction @xmath15 and different levels of initial population of the sterile state and compare them to @xmath7 case .",
    "@xmath3he is the most abundantly produced , most precisely measured and calculated element among the primordially formed light elements .",
    "it has also a simple post - bbn chemical evolution - it is only produced in stars .",
    "therefore , it is the preferred light element used for obtaining limits on nonstandard physics .",
    "primordially produced @xmath3he is calculated with great precision @xcite @xmath18 .",
    "the predicted @xmath3he value is in agreement with the observational data for @xmath3he inferred from astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "currently there are significantly different observational determinations of the primordial @xmath3he abundance , which point to the existence of greater systematic errors than assumed before .",
    "izotov and thuan have found @xmath19 for 82 hii regions and @xmath20 for 7 preferred hii regions , and @xmath21 for an extended data set of 89 hii regions @xcite .",
    "olive and skillman have re - analyzed their data and gave @xmath22 for all 82 hii regions and @xmath23 for the 7 preferred targets @xcite .",
    "the real uncertainty on the primordial @xmath3he abundance may be larger than previously assumed @xmath13 .",
    "present determinations of primordial @xmath3he abundance from observations of extragalactic hii regions , indicate a significantly grater uncertainty for the @xmath3he mass fraction @xcite namely @xmath24.he abundance , which was believed to be much smaller than at present @xcite . ]",
    "thus a derivation of cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters corresponding to about @xmath4",
    "@xmath3he overproduction seems relevant .",
    "the primordial @xmath3he abundance essentially depends on the freeze - out of nucleons , which occurs when in the process of expansion the weak processes rates @xmath25 , governing the neutron to proton transitions , become comparable to the expansion rate @xmath26 .",
    "so , the primordially produced mass fraction of @xmath3he @xmath27 , is a strong function of relativistic degrees of freedom at bbn epoch , which enter through @xmath26 , where @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 also depends on the electron neutrino characteristics , namely neutrino energy spectrum , number densities @xmath30 and the neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry , entering through @xmath25 , @xmath31 .",
    "non - empty initial sterile neutrino population , present at the start of oscillations , influences bbn by ( i ) increasing the expansion rate and ( ii ) suppressing the kinetic effects of @xmath32 on bbn .    1 .",
    "_ the presence of _ @xmath8 means increased effective number of neutrino species in equilibrium during bbn , and _ leads to faster expansion _ of the universe , @xmath33 causing earlier @xmath34-freezing , @xmath35 , hence , @xmath3he _ is overproduced_. this dynamical effect is parametrized through @xmath36 .",
    "2 .   in case of oscillations between non - equilibrium sterile neutrino state @xmath37 and electron",
    "neutrino , proceeding after @xmath38 decoupling , @xmath0 oscillations lead to considerable and continuous deviations from the equilibrium @xmath39 spectrum ( spectrum distortion ) and production of neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry .",
    "resonant oscillations @xcite .",
    "this dynamically produced asymmetry suppresses oscillations at small mixing angles .",
    "therefore , it leads to underproduction of @xmath3he and alleviates bbn constraints on oscillation parameters compared to the case without the account of asymmetry growth .",
    "we have accounted in this work for its effect as well , however the effect is sub - dominant and will not be discussed further on . ]",
    "+ this effects nucleons kinetics in the pre - bbn epoch @xcite .",
    "this kinetic effect may be parametrized in terms of additional neutrino @xmath40 and will be denoted further @xmath41 .",
    "non - zero _ @xmath8 _ suppresses the kinetic effect of oscillations _ : @xmath40 decreases with the increase of @xmath8 , hence @xmath8 _ leads to a decrease of the overproduction of _ @xmath3he .    for a wide range of oscillation parameters the kinetic effect of oscillations",
    "is large during the period of freezing of the nucleons and , therefore , affects bbn .",
    "this effect is strong even when there is a considerable population of the sterile neutrino state at the onset of the electron  sterile oscillations .",
    "the @xmath39 energy spectrum distortion is the greatest , if the sterile state is empty at the start of oscillations , @xmath7 and decreases with the increase of the sterile state degree of population @xcite .",
    "the same behavior is to be expected for the kinetic effect of oscillations .",
    "the total effect of ( i ) and ( ii ) can be approximately described by @xmath42 @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the kinetic oscillations effect , corresponding to @xmath7 .",
    "the expression presents a good approximation to the numerically calculated dependence of the kinetic effect on the initial population of @xmath1 , derived in reference @xcite :    there is an interesting interplay between the different effects which @xmath46 exerts on oscillations and on bbn with oscillations and hence , the @xmath47 production and the cosmological constraints on oscillations parameters for the case @xmath48 differ from the ones derived in references @xcite for @xmath7 .    as found in @xcite , for @xmath15 corresponding to @xmath49 , the suppression effect ( ii ) dominates over the dynamical effect ( i ) of @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the total effect is a decreasing function of @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath3he overproduction decreases with @xmath8 ( in comparison with the case @xmath7 ) and correspondingly the bbn constraints on oscillation parameters relax . in the opposite case @xmath50 ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath51 , the dynamical effect ( i ) dominates and the total effect is increasing with @xmath8 .",
    "i.e. @xmath3he overproduction increases and the bbn constraints on oscillations strengthen in comparison with the case @xmath7 . in the case",
    "@xmath52 the constraints for @xmath53 coincide with the ones for @xmath7 , due to the cancellation of the two effects ( i ) and ( ii ) .    for illustration of @xmath49 case , which we consider further on , we present in figure 1 the effects ( i ) and ( ii ) on @xmath3he overproduction at @xmath54 ev@xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we have studied numerically the contribution of these effects on neutrons to nucleons freezing ratio @xmath57 for different @xmath8 .",
    "the primordial yield of helium to a good approximation is expressed through @xmath58 : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the neutron lifetime . for the chosen set of parameters the @xmath3he overproduction decreases with the increase of @xmath8 .",
    "the suppression effect ( ii ) of @xmath8 dominates and a relaxation of the cosmological constraints compared to @xmath7 must be expected .    .    in the next section we present and discuss the calculated cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters corresponding to higher than @xmath4 @xmath3he overproduction and @xmath61 .",
    "bbn constraints corresponding to @xmath62 overproduction of @xmath3he and non - zero initial population of the sterile neutrino @xmath63 were calculated recently @xcite .",
    "as far as @xmath62 corresponds to @xmath64 , the constraints strengthen with the increase of the @xmath8 value .",
    "they increase the bbn @xmath13 @xmath3he exclusion region for oscillation parameters corresponding to @xmath7 towards smaller @xmath65 .    having in mind the existence of a large systematic error of @xmath3he measurements , in this work we provide a numerical calculation of cosmological constraints corresponding to @xmath66 @xmath3he overproduction ( @xmath49 ) and different initial degrees of sterile neutrino population in the range @xmath67 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath68 , i.e. a value slightly higher than the critical one @xmath4 , inorder to illustrate the possibility for relaxation of the cosmological constraints on oscillations for @xmath46 .",
    "our numerical analysis has shown that cosmological constraints corresponding to @xmath69 @xmath3he overproduction relax with the increase of @xmath8 values . up to @xmath70 the cosmological constraints are slightly relaxed in comparison with the case @xmath7 , however ,",
    "for higher @xmath8 values , the constraints relax noticeably .",
    "the reason for that is the predominance of ( ii ) effect ( the suppression of the oscillations kinetic effects ) over the dynamical effect ( i ) for the given uncertainty of @xmath3he .",
    "all cosmological constraints corresponding to @xmath15 will have such behaviour , namely , they will be relaxed in comparison to the constraints for @xmath71 .",
    "( vice versa , the constraints corresponding to lower than @xmath4 @xmath3he uncertainty will be more stringent than the ones for initially empty sterile neutrino state . )    in figure 2 @xmath72 bbn constraints are presented for different values of the initial population of the sterile state , namely the lowest dashed contour corresponds to a zero population , the solid curve corresponds to @xmath70 , the dotted and the dot dashed contours to @xmath73 and to @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "another interesting result is that there are considerable constraints even for a very high @xmath8 values for that really high @xmath3he uncertainty .",
    "i.e. the constraints on neutrino mixing parameter vanish only when the sterile state is in equilibrium before oscillations , when the kinetic effect due to neutrino spectrum distortion disappears , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "we have studied bbn constraints on neutrino @xmath0 oscillations for the specific case when the sterile neutrino is partially filled initially @xmath61 .",
    "non - zero @xmath8 has two - fold effect on bbn with neutrino oscillations : a dynamical effect leading to overproduction of he-4 and a kinetic effect , leading to underproduction of he-4 in comparison with the case of @xmath75 .",
    "so , depending on the interplay between these opposite effects , the cosmological constraints may be either relaxed or strengthened .",
    "we have provided detail numerical analysis of the bbn production of @xmath3he , @xmath29 , in the presence of @xmath0 neutrino oscillations , effective after electron neutrino decoupling . we have calculated and discussed cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters , corresponding to higher than @xmath4 uncertainty of helium-4 , for non - zero initial population of the sterile state @xmath5 .",
    "it was found that the cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters relax with the increase of @xmath8 .",
    "the cosmological constraints for the cases @xmath76 are slightly changed in comparison to @xmath7 case , however , for bigger @xmath8 the constraints are relaxed considerably and for @xmath17 they are alleviated .    resuming the results of the works discussing @xmath8 effect on bbn : cosmological constraints corresponding to higher than @xmath4 uncertainty of helium-4 ,",
    "relax with the increase of the initial population of the sterile state , while the constraints corresponding to lower than @xmath4 uncertainty of helium-4 strengthen with @xmath8 .",
    "it is remarkable , that in case of bbn with non - equilibrium oscillations between electron and sterile neutrinos , it is possible to obtain cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters even in the case when the @xmath3he abundance is known with uncertainty greater than 5@xmath16 ( actually , it is possible to derive constraints on neutrino oscillation parameters for he-4 uncertainty up to 32@xmath16 in the resonant oscillations case , and up to 14@xmath16 uncertainty in the nonresonant oscillations case , as far as these are the maximal possible helium overproduction values @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmological constraints persist while initially the sterile state is non equilibrium . when @xmath17 initially , the kinetic effect of oscillations is zero and it is not possible to obtain constraints on oscillation parameters in the discussed bbn models with non - equilibrium electron - sterile neutrino oscillations , as well as in bbn models with equilibrium electron - sterile neutrino oscillations"
