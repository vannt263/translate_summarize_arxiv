    "shock waves in molecular clouds are often created by the collisions of supersonic outflowing gas from pre - main sequence stars with ambient molecular gas from the clouds out of which the stars formed . the shock structure and physics",
    "are commonly studied using the emission lines of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath3 ) , which is dissociated when collisions of h@xmath3 and atoms or molecules occur at speeds exceeding 20 - 24  km  s@xmath4@xmath5 @xcite . in many cases",
    "the relative velocities of the outflow and cloud far exceed this limit , yet in many shocked clouds , strong h@xmath3 lines with broad velocity profiles are seen .",
    "the commonly accepted solution to this puzzle has been to invoke continuous shocks ( c - shocks ) , in which the ambient cloud is heated and gradually accelerated , first by collisions with ions in a magnetic precursor , and then by previously swept up molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the slower acceleration can result in a low peak temperature ( typically 2,000  k ) of the shock - heated gas and the rough maintenance of that temperature over a long column of shocked gas @xcite , reducing the amount of dissociation .",
    "shocks speeds can be as high as @xmath145 km  s@xmath6 before complete dissociation of the molecular gas occurs @xcite.the expected relative line intensities in such low temperature c - shocks are in contrast to jump shocks ( j - shocks ) , in which for velocities exceeding several km  s@xmath6 the molecular gas is suddenly heated to much higher temperatures and then quickly cools , resulting in a wide range of temperatures in the post - shock gas .",
    "excitation of h@xmath3 by ultraviolet radiation produced in the shock is another means by which the h@xmath3 can be excited into emission in its ro - vibrational lines @xcite .",
    "uv excitation produces a spectral signature distinct from that of collisionally heated h@xmath3 .",
    "an additional possibility is dissociation of the h@xmath3 at the shock front , followed by reformation of h@xmath3 on dust grains behind the shock front , with radiative cascading of h@xmath3 ejected from the grains down the vibrational ladder , eventually resulting in vibrational local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , as well as collisional thermalization of rotational levels @xcite .",
    "early attempts to distinguish between various shock types and cooling zones , which utilized measured relative intensities of h@xmath3 lines mostly in the orion molecular cloud @xcite and comparisons of velocity profiles at peak 1 @xcite , all found that that by themselves c - shock models were incompatible with the observations @xcite .",
    "probably the most significant of these tests @xcite was the measurement of 19 ro - vibrational and pure rotational lines between 2  @xmath7 m and 4  @xmath7 m at peak 1 , whose upper energy levels ranged up to @xmath125,000  k. the extinction - corrected relative intensities appeared to be more consistent with post - shock cooling starting at very high temperatures , i.e. , in the absence of a shock - softener .",
    "all of the tests mentioned above were made with angular resolutions of several arc - seconds , so it is possible that each observation took in a large number of c - shocks producing widely different peak temperatures , which might have blurred a potentially observable distinction between c - shocks and other possible explanations .",
    "more recent observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) used smaller apertures , but covered only small regions of the shocked gas .",
    "in addition , the lower instrumental sensitivities at those earlier times , although allowing the detection of a number of weak lines from energy levels much higher than expected in c - shocked gas , may have prevented a more complete understanding of the line emission . now , more than two decades later , larger telescopes and improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to observe h@xmath3 lines at an order of magnitude higher angular resolution and with much higher sensitivity , and thus to begin to examine shocked interstellar molecular gas in greater detail .    the collimated outflow ( jet ) from the protostar svs13 has produced a collection of herbig - haro objects , hh7hh11 , with a classic bow shock , hh7 , at its eastern end , as shown in fig .  [ map ] . the bow shock is bright in line emission from molecular hydrogen @xcite . as in the shock in the orion molecular cloud , h@xmath3 lines from upper energy levels as high as @xmath125,000  k have been detected in hh7 @xcite . at a distance of only 250  pc @xcite , hh7 is at about half the distance of the orion molecular cloud and its morphology projected onto the sky is much simpler . estimates of the inclination of hh7 to the line of sight vary considerably , but suggest an angle of @xmath140  @xmath8 @xcite . the proximity of hh7 , the relative simplicity of the geometry of the shock , and the brightness of the line emission suggested to us that hh7 would be a favorable object for investigating the detailed physics in a molecular shock .",

    "adaptive optics was not employed , as no nearby star of sufficient optical brightness is available for natural guide star adaptive optics and no suitable tip - tilt star is available near hh7 to allow laser guide star adaptive optics .",

    "although those authors found an excess in level populations for the highest excitation lines they measured , above that expected for 2,000  k gas , they fit the observed level populations to those produced in planar j - shocks with cooling of the hot gas being described by a power law model that approximated that given by h@xmath3 itself , rather than to cooling contributions from other species such as h@xmath3o and [ o i ] .    in the case of hh7",
    "the two - temperature fit to the population diagram is consistent with the measurements of @xcite , who found the h@xmath3 level populations could not be fit by a gas in lte at a single temperature , and are also compatible with the first measurements made of the h@xmath3 spectrum of this source by @xcite .",
    "the latter authors observed the 10 and 21 @xmath9(1 ) lines in the @xmath0band , as well as the 00 @xmath9(13 ) and 10 @xmath9(7 ) lines at 3.8@xmath7 m .",
    "from the former they estimated an excitation temperature @xmath65k , assuming a differential extinction between the two @xmath9(1 ) lines of @xmath66 , equivalent to @xmath67mags . from the 00 @xmath9(13 ) and 10 @xmath68(7 ) lines , which are well separated in energy level ( 17,450 vs.  8,300k ) but are at almost the same wavelengths and thus suffer identical extinctions , they determined @xmath69 3,100@xmath70k .",
    "the 00 @xmath9(13 ) line does not arise from a sufficiently high energy level for the hottest gas to be clearly identified , but nevertheless the presence of that gas is indicated by the higher excitation temperature .",
    "we have applied the two - temperature fit to predict the strengths of all h@xmath3 lines , making use of the energy levels and transition probabilities from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "five undetected lines , shown in table  [ undetectedlines ] , are predicted to have intensities @xmath71 units ( i.e.  @xmath72 in the flux scale of table  [ lines ] ) . of these lines , 21 @xmath9(25 )",
    "is blended with the strong 10 @xmath9(2 ) line , and 54 @xmath9(5 ) is blended with the strong 21 @xmath9(0 ) line , while the 75 @xmath68(5 ) , 64 @xmath68(7 ) and 43 @xmath9(2 ) lines fall in regions of the spectrum badly affected by telluric absorption .",
    "thus it is not expected that any of these lines would have been detected in our data .",
    "only one emission line in the spectrum is unidentified .",
    "it is at 2.1044  @xmath7 m and is only marginally detected .",
    "the closest h@xmath3 lines to this wavelength are 97 @xmath28(3 ) at 2.1006  @xmath7 m and 75 @xmath68(6 ) at 2.1090  @xmath7 m , each of which are @xmath110 spectral resolution elements distant and neither of which is predicted by our model to be detectable .",
    "thus this unidentified line , if real , is not due to h@xmath3 .",
    "the excitation temperature , t@xmath73 , of a pair of h@xmath3 lines is determined from their extinction - corrected intensities , @xmath74 , upper level energies , @xmath75 , spontaneous decay rates , @xmath76 , and the degeneracies of the rotational levels , @xmath77 , by    @xmath78    maps of the excitation temperature for selected h@xmath3 line pairs ( 21 @xmath9(1)/10 @xmath9(1 ) , 32 @xmath9(1)/21 @xmath9(1 ) , 32 @xmath9(3 ) / 21 @xmath9(1 ) , and 43 @xmath9(3 ) / 32 @xmath9(1 ) ) , based on values in 03  @xmath10  03 regions , are shown in figure [ ratiosmap ] , and histograms of each line ratio are displayed in fig .",
    "[ ratioshist ] .",
    "scatter plots of pairs of line ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ ratiosscat ] . in the latter figure",
    "the opacity of a data point scales with the strength of the 10  @xmath9(1 ) line , and thus roughly with the strengths of all of the lines .",
    "although each ratio apparently has a range of @xmath14 25%50% the values for the stronger lines cluster within much smaller ranges , centered on approximately 0.10 for 21 @xmath9(1)/10 @xmath9(1 ) , 0.16 for 32 @xmath9(1)/21 @xmath9(1 ) , 0.20 for 32 @xmath9(3)/21 @xmath9(1 ) , and about 0.45 for 43 @xmath9(3)/32 @xmath9(1 ) .",
    "because the strengths of all of these lines scale roughly with the strength of the 10 @xmath9(1 ) line , and the signal - to - noise ratios on the 32 and 43 lines are not very high , we believe that much of the scatter is due to noise ( random fluctuations and/or cosmic rays that produced slightly spurious data points not obvious enough to be removed or corrected ) .",
    "our derived 21 @xmath9(1)/10 @xmath9(1 ) flux ratios in the bright portion of the shocked gas are somewhat lower that found by @xcite .",
    "the above values of the line ratios correspond to excitation temperatures of 2150  k , 2920  k , 2960  k , and 5300  k , respectively .",
    "the trend , that ratios involving transitions from higher energy levels are associated with higher excitation temperatures , is similar to that seen previously in hh7 and elsewhere , as discussed in section 5.1 .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ colddenfit ] makes it clear in that in hh7 the excited h@xmath3 producing the @xmath0-band lines is not distributed over a wide range of temperatures but instead is predominantly at only two temperatures , @xmath12000  k and @xmath15000  k , and thus that the different excitation temperatures reflect the different contributions to the line emission from the two components .",
    "the most important result from these observations is the discovery of a significant contribution to the h@xmath3 line emission from molecular gas in lte at about 5,000  k , a much higher temperature than has been previously found in shocked molecular gas .",
    "the vast majority of the @xmath0-band line emission from hh7 comes from gas at @xmath12000  k , which can be accounted for by a continuous - shock @xcite in which a magnetic precursor associated with the high speed outflow ( from ssv  13 ) gradually accelerates the ambient molecular gas , with the result that the collisions between the bulk of the outflowing ambient gas does not dissociate the molecules .",
    "however , the origin of the much smaller amount of emitting h@xmath3 at @xmath15,000  k is less clear .",
    "previously @xcite suggested the presence of a fluorescent component to the h@xmath3 line emission in hh7 , based on measured fluxes of a few lines from @xmath15=14 and @xmath79 upper levels with energies up to @xmath125,000  k. however , our analysis of the spectrum of hh7 shows that the emission is clearly thermal in nature , with the column densities showing no significant deviation from the fit to a two - temperature component boltzmann distribution , up to the dissociation energy of the h@xmath3 molecule at 4.5ev .",
    "a significant contribution from uv - excited h@xmath3 would result in significantly higher vibrational than rotational temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) derived from the level column densities and would have created a much more scattered distribution of data points in fig .",
    "[ colddenfit ] . in dense gas collisional re - distribution can lead to a thermalization of lower vibration levels , giving rise to an apparent thermal distribution in v=0 , 1 , and 2 with @xmath80k , but the higher vibrational levels , which spontaneously decay more rapidly , would still retain the signature of the non - thermal fluorescent cascade .",
    "we note that the model of hh7 by @xcite , based on observations of the 1 - 0 @xmath9(1 ) and 21 @xmath9(1 ) lines , does not predict significant fluorescent line emission .      sufficiently fast shocks ( @xmath8150 km s@xmath6 )",
    "are expected to result not only in nearly complete dissociation of h@xmath3 @xcite , but also ionization of atomic hydrogen .",
    "this would result in recombination line emission from atomic hydrogen .",
    "any surviving h@xmath3 in the this region could be heated to temperatures of many thousands of kelvins . however , no hint of br  @xmath82 line emission at 2.166  @xmath7 m is present in fig .",
    "[ binned_spec ] ; its intensity must be at least 1,000 times less than that of the 1 - 0 @xmath9(1 ) line .",
    "our coarse examination of the data cube shows little or no evidence for h  i br  @xmath82 line emission elsewhere , although at one or two locations within the bow shock br  @xmath82 may be present , at flux levels five times lower than the adjacent h@xmath3 21 @xmath9(2 ) line and 100 times weaker than the fiducial 10 @xmath9(1 ) line at those locations .",
    "no br  @xmath82 line emission is present along the western ridge of emission at high negative velocities , which we have identified with the shock in the jet , where the shock conditions may be more extreme than elsewhere .    in an analysis of observations of the molecular shock in the supernova remnant",
    "ic 443 @xcite obtained a lower limit of 40 on the h@xmath3 1 - 0 @xmath9(1 ) to br  @xmath82 line intensity ratio .",
    "that limit allowed them to rule out fast j - shocks ( @xmath15  @xmath27  100  km  s@xmath6 ) in the molecular gas , as these would have produced detectable levels of br  @xmath82 line emission .",
    "however , neither slower j - shocks , nor c - shocks , could be ruled out by these authors in ic 443 .",
    "our lower limit to the above ratio in hh7 is considerably higher .",
    "we similarly conclude that fast dissociative j - shocks are not present in hh7 .",
    "formation pumping is another possible means of contributing high excitation lines to the h@xmath3 emission spectrum . after being formed on dust grain surfaces @xcite ,",
    "h@xmath3 molecules are ejected in excited states following the release of their 4.5ev binding energy .",
    "some of the energy must overcome the grain surface potential , and the rest is distributed between kinetic energy and internal energy ( in ro - vibrational levels ) , with the latter being emitted largely in lines as the molecules relax , as first modeled by @xcite .",
    "the formation process and the properties of the ejected h@xmath3 depend on the nature of the grain surface .",
    "@xcite considered the surfaces to be highly defected silicates to which the molecule is moderately strongly bound . a later study @xcite considered h@xmath3 formation on amorphous h@xmath3o ice ( where it is weakly bound ) and on aromatic carbon molecules ( e.g.  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) or hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hacs ) , where it is strongly bound ) . in the former , which presumably does not apply to recently shock - heated matter",
    ", h@xmath3 would be released from the surface in highly excited states , with the binding energy virtually all going into internal energy . in the latter case , which may also not apply ,",
    "most of the binding energy would be distributed through the many degrees of freedom of the aromatic molecule , leaving the newly - formed h@xmath3 in a low - excitation state .",
    "subsequent investigators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have also studied formation on these surfaces .",
    "currently there is no clear view as to the level distribution which the newly formed molecules would have .",
    "@xcite predicted that the h@xmath3 molecules are ejected into the @xmath83 level , containing about 1.5ev of the bond energy .",
    "observations in the northern bar of the m17 photodissociation region ( pdr ) by @xcite were interpreted by the authors as the signature of h@xmath3 formation pumping , through their detection of emission in the 1.7326  @xmath7 m 64 @xmath68(3 ) line , and based on the clear difference of its emission morphology from that of lower - excitation fluorescent h@xmath3 lines in the region .",
    "that line originates from a level 31,055k ( @xmath12.7  ev ) above ground state .",
    "however considerably different level distributions have been proposed by the other investigators cited above .",
    "we have found that the highly excited h@xmath3 is roughly in lte at @xmath15,000  k. although it is possible that h@xmath3 molecules are released from the grains with a thermal internal energy distribution , we consider it more likely they are ejected in a highly excited , but non - thermally distributed ro - vibrational levels , as in many of the theoretical calculations .",
    "if so they would need to be quickly collisionally re - distributed in the post - shock gas , to produce the observed thermal population distribution at @xmath15,000  k. that temperature is equivalent to 0.45ev and would represent about one - third of the internal energy if the h@xmath3 molecules are released with the 1.5ev in the @xcite model , and about 15% of the energy if all h@xmath3 were released into the 64 @xmath68(3 ) level seen in the m17 pdr .",
    "alternatively , if the ejected molecules do have energies of several ev they might be able to collisionally heat a larger mass of gas , for instance @xmath84 times more if ejection occurred with h@xmath3 in @xmath85 levels .",
    "this redistribution must also happen rapidly , since the cooling time for highly excited levels is short ; the radiative decay rates for high energy states are relatively large .",
    "for instance the 64 @xmath68(3 ) line has a decay rate four times larger than the 10 @xmath9(1 ) line , and a corresponding cooling timescale of one week .",
    "if the density in the post - shock gas is at least 10@xmath86  @xmath87 and is at temperatures of @xmath15,000  k rapid collisional cooling of the hot , dense newly formed h@xmath3 will occur on timescales of at most a few days .",
    "these results , particularly those relating to the existence of the hot h@xmath3 , pose many questions requiring additional observations and calculations .",
    "foremost among them are determining the uniqueness of @xmath15,000  k gas and understanding its origin .",
    "first , does the temperature of this hot gas and its abundance relative to the warm gas vary with location in the hh7 shock ? as pointed out , the weak lines are difficult to observe far from the brightest portions of the shock .",
    "however , we have only observed a part of the brightest region . in particular , it could be revealing to observe the @xmath0-band h@xmath3 spectrum in the cap of the bow shock , where one would expect that there is more dissociation . if the hot h@xmath3 is newly reformed it might constitute a higher faction of the line emitting gas there .",
    "second , are the temperature of the hot gas , and indeed its existence unique to hh7 ? we expect that the answer to the second part of this question is no , as lines from energy levels as high as 25,000  k have been seen elsewhere in collisionally excited h@xmath3 , as discussed earlier , and reveal a similar dependence of excitation temperature on upper energy level as found in hh7 .",
    "we have very recently obtained deep @xmath0 band spectra of shocked h@xmath3 in the omc-1 outflow extending from near its peak  1 through one of the bright h@xmath3  bullets \" @xcite , which should shed light on both parts of this question .",
    "third , could spectra at higher velocity resolution than presented here of lines from a wide range of upper level energies provide clues to the relationship of the hot component to the warm component ?    on the theoretical side ,",
    "if the hot h@xmath3 is recently reformed on grains it is important to determine its formation rate and its initial energy level distribution as it leaves the grains , and to understand the competition between energy loss via line emission and via collisions .",
    "if the internal energy is redistributed from a higher temperature distribution or from an initial non - lte initial distribution the resulting ( observed ) temperature is likely to be sensitive to the physical conditions in the shocked gas , and in particular its density .",
    "finally there is even the question of how a single hot temperature would result from any re - distribution .",
    "the high quality of the two - temperature fit suggests that , if the hot h@xmath3 in hh7 is reformed h@xmath3 , it must cool quickly from @xmath15,000  k to @xmath12,000 k so that intermediate temperatures are not detected in a population diagram .",
    "if that is not the case then the hot h@xmath3 would seem to have to be located in a separate environment that is physically detached from the bulk of the post - shock gas .",
