    "the distribution of charge of the nucleus influences the dirac energies of atomic systems as well as the quantum electrodynamical corrections to the energy levels .",
    "this effect , termed as the nuclear size ( ns ) correction , is important for comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data for the whole range of the nuclear charges @xmath7 , from hydrogen ( @xmath6 ) up to uranium ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ns corrections to the one - loop self energy and vacuum polarization have been previously investigated both within the approach based on the expansion in the nuclear binding strength parameter @xmath5 @xcite ( where @xmath9 is the fine structure constant ) and within the numerical approach that accounts the parameter @xmath5 to all orders @xcite . in the high-@xmath7 region ,",
    "the numerical all - order approach provides accurate predictions for the ns effect on the radiative corrections . for lower @xmath7 , however , the ns effect diminishes and becomes increasingly more difficult to identify in a numerical calculation . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath5-expansion approach provides accurate predictions for the low-@xmath7 ions and only the qualitative estimates in the high-@xmath7 region .",
    "a quantitative cross - check of the two complementary approaches is not simple and has not been accomplished up to now .",
    "the ns corrections became of particular interest recently , after the results of the muonic hydrogen lamb - shift experiment were announced @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the value for the proton charge radius @xmath10 deduced from the muonic hydrogen differs by five standard deviations from the spectroscopic value of @xmath10 derived from the hydrogen atom .",
    "this unexplained disagreement stimulates the scientific community to double - check all contributions originating from the nuclear charge distribution , both for the muonic and normal atoms .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to perform an accurate numerical all - order calculation of the ns correction to the one - loop self energy and vacuum polarization and to make a detailed comparison with the @xmath5-expansion results available .    the relativistic units ( @xmath11 = @xmath12 ) and the charge units @xmath13 are used in this paper .",
    "the leading - order ns correction to the energy levels of a hydrogen - like atom is defined as the difference of the corresponding eigenvalues of the dirac equation with the point - coulomb and the extended - nucleus potentials .",
    "the two most commonly used models of the nuclear charge distribution are the uniformly charged sphere ( `` sph '' ) and the two - parameter fermi ( `` fer '' ) model , @xmath14}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the radius of the sphere with the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the parameters of the fermi distribution , and @xmath19 are the normalization factors .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 of the fermi distribution is standardly fixed by @xmath20  fm . for a given value of the rms radius , the parameter @xmath17 can be determined by the simple approximate formula @xmath21 in the calculations performed in this work , we will assume that the parameter @xmath17 of the fermi distribution is fixed _",
    "exactly _ by the above formula .    for the uniformly charged sphere model , the dirac equation can be solved analytically @xcite . in this case , the ns correction to the dirac energy is represented in terms of the hypergeometric function . while the exact expression is rather cumbersome , simple approximate expressions for the ns correction obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are highly useful . for the general model of the nuclear charge distribution , the ns correction can be easily obtained by numerical solution of the dirac equation .",
    "numerical results are conveniently parameterized in terms of the function @xmath22 , whose definition is inspired by the analytic relativistic results @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the radius of the sphere with the rms radius @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath26 is a slowly varying function of @xmath5 and @xmath16 and its numerical values are of order of unity .",
    "the numerical results obtained for the ns correction with the fermi model of the nuclear charge distribution are listed in table  [ tab : fns ] .",
    "the numerical evaluation was performed by solving the dirac equation with help of the radial package @xcite and , independently , by using the b - spline finite basis set method @xcite . for calculations in the low-@xmath7 region ,",
    "the radial package was upgraded into the quadruple arithmetics ( about 32 digits ) .",
    "the values of the rms charge radii used were taken from the compilation @xcite for all ions except for uranium ; the uranium rms radius was taken from ref .",
    "the one - loop self - energy contribution to the lamb shift is given by a matrix element of the self - energy operator with the mass renormalization part subtracted , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the mass counterterm .",
    "the self - energy operator is @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the photon propagator , @xmath32 is the dirac - coulomb green function , @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian , and @xmath35 are the dirac matrices . the nuclear - size self - energy ( nse ) correction is defined as the difference between the matrix elements ( [ se1 ] ) evaluated with the point - coulomb potential and the potential of the extended - charge nucleus",
    ".    numerical , all - order ( in @xmath5 ) evaluation of the one - loop self - energy correction have been extensively discussed in the literature over past decades @xcite , both for the case of the point - coulomb and extended - nucleus potentials . in the present investigation",
    ", we employ the method developed in our previous work @xcite for the case of the point nucleus .",
    "this method can be immediately extended to a general ( local and spherically - symmetrical ) potential , provided that one can calculate the green function of the dirac equation with this potential .",
    "( beside the full green function , the one - potential green function is also needed in actual calculations . ) in the present work , we develop an efficient scheme of computation of the dirac green function for a general potential , which is described in appendix  [ app:1 ] for the full green function and appendix  [ app:2 ] for the one - potential green function .    the main advantage of the method reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is a fast convergence of the partial - wave expansion of the matrix element ( [ se1 ] ) . in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the difference between the point - nucleus and extended - nucleus matrix elements . for this difference",
    ", the partial - wave expansion converges even faster ( especially , in the low-@xmath7 region ) than for the self - energy correction .",
    "because of this , we were able to significantly improve numerical accuracy as compared to results previously reported in the literature .",
    "numerical results for the nse correction to the energy shift are usually parameterized in the same way as the one - loop self - energy itself , @xmath36 comparison of the present results with those by mohr and soff @xcite for the homogeneously charged sphere model is given in table  [ tab : sefns : compar ] .",
