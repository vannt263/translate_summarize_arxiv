    "ubiquitous , secure , and high data rate communication is a basic requirement for the next generation wireless communication systems .",
    "the rapid growth of wireless data traffic in the past decades has heightened the energy consumption in both transmitters and receivers . as a result ,",
    "multiuser multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) has been proposed in the literature for facilitating energy efficient wireless communication . although the energy dissipation of the transmitters may be significantly reduced by multiuser mimo technology , mobile communication devices and sensor devices are still often powered by batteries with limited energy storage capacity .",
    "frequently replacing the device batteries can be costly and inconvenient in difficult - to - access environments , or even infeasible for medical sensors embedded inside the human body .",
    "hence , the limited lifetime of communication networks constitutes a major bottleneck in providing quality of service ( qos ) to the end - users .",
    "recently , energy harvesting based mobile communication system design has drawn significant interest from both academia and industry since it enables self - sustainability of energy constrained wireless devices .",
    "traditionally , wind , solar , and biomass , etc .",
    "are the major sources for energy harvesting .",
    "although these renewable energy sources are perpetual , their availability usually depends on location and climate which may not be suitable for mobile devices . on the other hand , wireless energy transfer technology , which allows receivers to scavenge energy from the ambient radio frequency ( rf ) signals ,",
    "has attracted much attention lately although the concept can be traced back to nikola tesla s work in the early 20th century @xcite .",
    "there have been some preliminary applications of wireless energy transfer such as wireless body area networks ( wban ) for biomedical implants , passive radio - frequency identification ( rfid ) systems , and wireless sensor networks .",
    "indeed , the combination of rf energy harvesting and communication provides the possibility of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) which imposes many new and interesting challenges for wireless communication engineers @xcite@xcite . in @xcite , the trade - off between channel capacity and harvested energy",
    "was studied for near - field communication over a frequency selective channel . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigated the performance limits of a three - node wireless mimo broadcast channel for swipt .",
    "in particular , the tradeoffs between maximal information rate versus energy transfer were characterized by the boundary of a rate - energy ( r - e ) region . in @xcite , a power splitting receiver and a separated receiver were proposed to realize concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting for narrow - band single - antenna communication systems . in @xcite@xcite , different resource allocation algorithms were proposed for improving the utilization of limited system resources .",
    "optimal beamforming and power allocation design was studied for multiuser narrow - band systems with multiple transmit antennas in @xcite , while the resource allocation algorithm design for wide - band swipt systems was studied in @xcite@xcite . in @xcite and @xcite , the energy efficiency of multi - carrier modulation with swipt",
    "was investigated for single user and multiuser systems , respectively .",
    "in particular , it was shown in @xcite that the energy efficiency of a communication system can be improved by integrating an energy harvester into a conventional information receiver which further motivates the deployment of swipt in practice .",
    "besides , a power allocation algorithm was designed for the maximization of spectral efficiency of swipt systems employing power splitting receivers in @xcite . the results in @xcite@xcite reveal that the amount of harvested energy at the receivers can be increased by increasing the transmit power of the information signals .",
    "however , a high signal power may also lead to substantial information leakage due to the broadcast nature of the wireless communication channel and facilitate eavesdropping .",
    "the notion of physical ( phy ) layer security in swipt systems has recently been pursued in @xcite@xcite . by exploiting multiple antennas ,",
    "transmit beamforming and artificial noise generation can be utilized for providing communication security while guaranteeing qos in wireless energy transfer to energy harvesting receivers .",
    "however , the resource allocation algorithms in @xcite@xcite were designed for a single information receiver and single - antenna eavesdroppers .",
    "the results in @xcite@xcite may not be applicable to the case of multiple - antenna eavesdroppers . besides",
    ", the works in @xcite@xcite did not take into account fairness issues in transferring energy to energy harvesting receivers .",
    "nevertheless , fairness is an essential qos figure of merit for wireless energy transfer .    in this paper , we focus on the resource allocation algorithm design for providing fairness to energy receivers in the wireless energy transfer process while guaranteing communication secrecy to information receivers . the resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non - convex optimization problem . in particular , we promote the dual use of artificial noise for secrecy communication and efficient wireless energy transfer provisioning .",

    "indeed , for satisfying a more stringent sinr requirement , the transmitter is forced to allocate a higher power to the information signal and to steer the direction of transmission towards the information receivers . besides",

    "this can be explained by the fact that the optimal scheme can fully utilize the degrees of freedom offered by the system for resource allocation .",
    "in contrast , although multiuser and artificial noise interference are eliminated at the information receivers for baseline scheme 1 and baseline scheme 2 , respectively , the degrees of freedom for resource allocation in the baseline schemes are reduced which results in a lower harvested energy at the energy harvesting receivers .",
