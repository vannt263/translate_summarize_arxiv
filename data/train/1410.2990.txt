    "the increase in @xmath1 dose induce increase in time to attain stability of @xmath0 dynamics ( amplitude death ) indicating increase in unstability of @xmath0 dynamics ( fig .",
    "2 third panel ) . this could be due to the fact that the increase in @xmath1 dose may cause high dna damage leading to more stress in @xmath0",
    ".    however , if the @xmath1 dose is comparatively strong ( @xmath56 ) , the damage within the dna is also high which may cause the collapse of the @xmath0 oscillatory behaviour ( fig .",
    "2 fourth panel ) and then repaired back the dna damage to come back to @xmath0 oscillatory condition .",
    "we also found that the time of collapse ( @xmath2 ) increases as @xmath1 dose increases ( fig .",
    "2 fifth panel ) and it becomes difficult to repair back the dna damage",
    ". in general @xmath0 will collapse forever and will not be recovered back if @xmath57 ( probably case of apoptosis ) . however , in real situation , one probably can define a critical @xmath4 such that , if @xmath6 , @xmath0 could come back after dna repair , and otherwise it will go to apoptosis .",
    "nevertheless , it is very difficult to find out this @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig4 ]          we simulate the maxima of @xmath0 amplitudes after removing the transients as a function of @xmath1 ( fig .",

    "the separation between two phases oscillation death and oscillating regimes are clearly visible after the @xmath61 and @xmath2 increases as @xmath1 increases .    generally as @xmath57 when @xmath62 ,",
    "but numerically we approximately found that after @xmath63 @xmath2 become @xmath64 hours and becomes constant ( fig .",
    "3 inset ) .",
    "this means that for any @xmath6 , the @xmath0 can able to recover back to normal stable state by repairing dna damage , otherwise , the system ca nt able to come back to normal state , but will go to apoptosis .      since cell cycle and @xmath0 regulatory networks",
    "are interacted through @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , the temporal behaviour of cyclin can be regulated by @xmath0 via @xmath1 and @xmath10 . when @xmath55 , the two networks work in normal condition , leaving @xmath0 dynamics at low level ( stabilized state ) ( fig",
    ". 2 upper panel ) and sustain oscillation in cyclin dynamics ( fig .",
    "4 upper left panel ) . as @xmath1 increases",
    ", @xmath0 will get activated through dna damage giving oscillatory behaviour affecting the dynamics of cyclin .",
    "when @xmath65 , the cyclin dynamics shows chaotic behaviour upto @xmath66 hours , and then the dynamics becomes sustain oscillation ( fig .",
    "4 second left panel and upper right panel ) .",
    "the chaotic behaviour in cyclin dynamics could due to the sudden activation in @xmath0 dynamics due to @xmath1 irradiation .",
    "now as @xmath1 increases ( @xmath67 ) , we get various situations in the cyclin dynamics , namely , the emergence of period two ( for @xmath68 $ ] hours ) , period 3 ( for @xmath69 $ ] hours ) , chaotic regime ( for @xmath70 $ ] hours ) and sustain oscillation regime ( for @xmath71 hours ) ( fig",
    ". 4 second right upper panel ) .",
    "further , as @xmath1 increases the emergence of oscillation death regime started to exist in the cyclin dynamics ( fig .",
    "4 fourth right panel onwards ) and the oscillation death regime become larger . further increase in @xmath1 compels the period 2 and 3 regimes to vanish after some value of @xmath1 ( @xmath72 ) and the chaotic regime becomes larger .",
    "[ fig5 ]        [ fig6 ]        the perturbation induced by @xmath0 through @xmath1 to the cyclin via @xmath10 clearly induces cyclin dynamics to various states shown by the bifurcation diagram ( fig . 4 right panels ) .",
    "we also notice that as one decreases or increases to cross over to sustain oscillation , the state just before it is chaotic regime .",
    "the emergence of oscillation death regime starts from @xmath73 and then switch to sustain oscillation after sometime .",
    "this oscillation death regime corresponds to the collapse time due to strong sudden dna damage .",
    "once the dna damage is recovered it comes back to sustain oscillation .",
    "if the @xmath1 is very large then oscillation death regime is large enough that dna damage can not be repaired back halting the cell cycle permanantly and goes to apoptosis .",
    "we present the temporal behaviour of @xmath3 regulated by @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "5 ) which induce at different states in @xmath3 shown by bifurcation diagrams .",
    "the impact upon the @xmath3 due to @xmath0 via @xmath1 is not a direct phenomena but through @xmath10 molecule in the network .",
    "various studies reported that @xmath10 directly interact with cyclin dependent kinases , which has very important role in the formation of maturation promoting factor ( mpf ) .",
    "the interaction of @xmath10 with @xmath11 leads to less availability of @xmath11 due to the formation of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , various experimental results also reported that @xmath10 directly interacts with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is observed that a @xmath55 , the @xmath3 dynamics shows sustain oscillatory behaviour showing no impact of @xmath0 .",
    "further , as @xmath1 dose increases the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath3 is abruptly changed inducing different states of @xmath3 as we obtained in the case of cyclin .",
    "the increase in @xmath1 induce different states oscillation death , period 1 , 2 , 3 , chaotic and sustain oscillation regimes indicated by the bifurcation diagram for various @xmath1 values .",
    "moreover , as @xmath1 increases the width of oscillation death @xcite regime also increases and if @xmath1 is not strong enough the dna can able to repair back otherwise the system will go to apoptosis .",
    "we study the regulation of cell cycle dynamics by @xmath0 via @xmath1 .",
    "the maxima values of @xmath3 ( @xmath74 ) and cyclin ( @xmath75 ) as a function of @xmath1 are calculated for a range of time in the range @xmath76 $ ] hours ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "it is observed that for low @xmath1 dose , @xmath74 exhibits chaotic behaviour .",
    "howeover , if @xmath1 dose is comparatively high , @xmath74 becomes almost constant .",
    "if the value of @xmath1 is moderate , period 1 , 2 , 3 etc are exhibited in the bifurcation diagram .",
    "this indicates that @xmath74 is @xmath0 dependent via @xmath1 and @xmath0 controls the @xmath74 behaviour in the system .",
    "similarly , one can also observe the @xmath1 dependent maxima of cyclin @xmath75 in the bifurcation diagram ( fig .",
    "6 lower panel ) .",
    "the moderate values of @xmath1 induce different periods in @xmath75 .",
    "excess values of @xmath1 shows different behaviour in @xmath75 .",
    "we study the way how @xmath0 , one of the largest hubs in cellular network , regulates and controls cell cycle dynamics . we studied the behaviour of different molecules which are highly involved in the checking of cell cycle at g2 phase driven by @xmath0 via @xmath1 .",
    "the simulation results of the model provided us to understand the biological phenomenon and mechanism of cell cycle arrest due to dna damage faced by the cell due to the irradiation .",
    "the results we got are closely in agreement with the previous experimental reports @xcite .",
    "our study suggested that the temporal dynamics of molecular species involved in cell cycle , considered in the model , are controlled by @xmath0 .",
    "the role of @xmath10 protein in the delay of g2 phase was considered as a cross - talk between @xmath0 regulatory network and cell cycle .",
    "the sudden irradiation to the system with high dose induce collapse of the system due to dna damage , leading to cell cycle arrest .",
    "the cell cycle is resumed again to normal situation by repairing back the dna damage .",
    "moreover , the time of recovery from cell cycle arrest and then resumption of oscillation depends on the amount of dose of @xmath1 exposed to the system .    during the process of regulation of cell cyle by @xmath0 via @xmath1 we observed the emergence of different periods ( 1 , 2 , 3 etc ) in the bifurcation diagram of oscillatory dynamics of cell cycle variables ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) which may have various information of certain biological significance .",
    "further , the dynamics of these variables switched to various states , namely , chaotic , oscillation death ( stabilized state ) , bifurcating to various periods of oscillation and sustain oscillation states during the process of time evolution",
    ". these states could be the different phases of the variables to self - recover back to its normal condition from the sudden stress given to the system .",
    "however , how do these complicated states are used by the system dynamics when the system is perturbed need to be investigated further .",
    "the study also demonstrates the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by perturbed @xmath0 via @xmath1 indicated by collapse of the oscillation ( oscillation death ) for certain interval of time ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this collapse time is a function of strength of the perturbation imparted to the system .",
    "our study shows that there is a minimum value of @xmath77 , below which the system comes back to its normal state , otherwise the system will go to apoptosis .",
    "our findings will probably be useful for the further study on the impact of @xmath0 on cell cycle checking at g2 phase and related dynamics .",
