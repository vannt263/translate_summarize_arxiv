    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , now in the early stages of discovery level searches , is currently probing the weak scale for signs of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "although a model independent approach to new physics searches should primarily involve searching for deviations from sm predictions of any kind , a specific discovery can not be claimed without more detailed information about the processes that occur subsequent to the initial particle collisions . therefore obtaining precise measurements of theoretical parameters , such as the mass spectrum of new particle states ,",
    "is an endeavor of particular importance .    in this paper , we propose techniques for measuring particle masses from several different signatures containing missing transverse momentum .",
    "we assume that some heavy new particle states are pair produced and then participate in sequential two - body cascade decays that produce visible sm particles , until some effectively stable and non - interacting new particle is reached at the bottom of the decay chain .",
    "this is the canonical and well - studied `` dual cascade decay chain '' signature , well known for being the canonical signature of r - parity conserving supersymmetry ( susy ) models .",
    "none of the kinematic techniques discussed in this paper will rely on the fact that the cascade decay chains be supersymmetric in nature , thus all of these techniques may be applied generally to any bsm model that contains this topology as a signature .",
    "however , due to the familiarity with supersymmetric terminology , we will generically refer to the `` lightest meta - stable particle '' as the `` lsp '' and the `` next - to - lightest meta - stable particle '' as the `` nlsp '' .",
    "our analysis will focus on a subset of these scenarios in which the last step of the cascade decay involves some long - lived new particle state that travels a finite distance before decaying in flight this will result in a signature of displaced vertices or displaced tracks in the detector .",
    "the techniques to be described here are model independent which is fortunate since missing transverse momentum is a fairly generic feature of models for physics beyond the sm .",
    "this is because general phenomenological considerations often motivate new discrete symmetries , resulting in the presence of effectively non - interacting stable particle states . in the case of susy for example , r - parity",
    "is often invoked to exclude dangerous operators that can result in phenomenologically inconsistent effects like proton decay . in the case of extra dimensional models ,",
    "it is the conservation of momentum along the extra dimension that will result in the pair production of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states and subsequently guarantee the stability of the lightest kk mode .",
    "one can even invoke cosmological arguments like the `` wimp miracle '' calculations to argue that missing energy signatures might be a generic phenomenologically desirable feature of models for new physics at the weak scale .",
    "the presence of metastable new particle states is also fairly common and can arise in supersymmetric models with low scale susy breaking or scenarios where r - parity conservation is only approximate . in this paper",
    ", we address the question of whether or not it is possible , under any circumstances , to recover all of the kinematic information lost through missing energy on an event - by - event basis .",
    "if all of the final state particles from a given collision are visible through the detector , then the measurement of on - shell particle masses can easily be performed through the straightforward reconstruction of a mass resonance peak . however , if one or more of the final state particles are effectively stable and non - interacting , then the situation is much more challenging . in particular ,",
    "particle masses can not be calculated directly on a mass peak resonance since crucial kinematic quantities can not be measured . in response to this issue , many general techniques have been developed for performing indirect measurements of particle masses through cleverly constructed kinematic variables @xcite . in particular , the author in @xcite introduces a very generic method for constructing such variables via phase space singularity structures .",
    "many studies have also been performed based on kinematics specific to the canonical cascade decay chain @xcite . in general ,",
    "novel kinematic structures that characterize an event can often be used to reconstruct lost information .",
    "for example , @xcite also discuss a long - lived nlsp , and the use of timing information to perform such reconstructions . for different topologies of the decay chain , @xcite provides a comprehensive review .",
    "the drawback to most of these methods is the fact that most of the kinematic variables that can be constructed to provide an indirect mass measurement , require a very large number of events for telling features to become practically visible in statistical distributions .",
    "these methods would therefore be difficult to utilize during early discovery level searches .",
    "first , using our assumptions we will show that one can write down an expression for the 3-momenta of each lsp as a function of the direction of the 3-momenta of each nlsp .",
    "this unit vector can then be written in terms of the locations of the secondary vertices .",
    "we will then follow with a description of some novel methods for reconstructing particle masses using this information .",
    "examples of explicit mass reconstruction will be performed using monte carlo parton - level data , highlighting the effectiveness of these methods in some of the diverse topologies that can occur within the cascade .",
    "finally we will conclude with a discussion of how this relates to current susy searches being performed at the lhc .",
    "we argue then , that the optimal strategy for `` searching under the lamp post '' during these early runs will be to search for signatures with two displaced vertices ( or two displaced tracks in situations where the exact location of the secondary vertices can not be measured ) .",
    "let us denote the stable lsp particles by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , their mother nlsp particles as @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the final visible sm particles as @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ [ proc ] ] shows a diagram of a typical event .",
    "since we assume that the 4-momenta of the two lsp s are not measurable , each event yields @xmath6 unknown quantities .",
    "the transverse missing momentum is given by the vector sum of the lsp 3-momenta projected onto the transverse plane .",
    "since this plane is 2-dimensional , a missing transverse momentum measurement eliminates @xmath7 degrees of freedom bringing the number of unknowns down to @xmath8 . in order to construct constraint equations with which to solve for these unknowns ,",
    "we follow the work of @xcite and assume some symmetry between the two sides of the decay chains .",
    "for example , if we assume that @xmath9 then we can use the fact that @xmath10 as a constraint with which to eliminate one of the unknown momentum components .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the number of such equations we can construct . since all of the unknown quantities involve components of the lsp 4-momenta , @xmath11 can be viewed as the number of masses starting from the bottom of one decay chain but excluding the lsp , that we assume to be equal to the masses on the opposite side of the decay chain . utilizing these constraints ,",
    "the number of unknowns can be reduced to @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to keep in mind however , that such an exact relationship between the masses of these particles only holds in the very narrow width limit . in general",
    ", the true kinematically reconstructed masses will lie on the distribution of some mass peak resonance and the equality of the masses will only be approximately true .",
    "this will affect both the accuracy of the mass measurement as well as potentially the existence of solutions to the constraint equations .",
    "we will return to a more detailed discussion of this in the body of the paper .     and",
    "@xmath13 ) are pair produced .",
    "they then cascade down to a pair of non - interacting stable particles ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) shooting off visible sm particles ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) along the way.,width=377 ]    if we assume that we have access to @xmath16 events with the same topology then we can use the equality of masses across events to further constrain the problem as done in @xcite .",
    "for the first event we counted @xmath12 unknowns .",
    "each additional event contributes another @xmath12 unknowns but if we enforce the equality of masses across different events then we should subtract off another factor of @xmath11 .",
    "thus each additional event contributes @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath16 events , the total number of unknowns is @xmath18 .",
    "the condition which must be satisfied in order to properly constrain the problem is thus clearly @xmath19 .",
    "given our assumptions that the nlsp is the only particle in the spectrum with a finite and measurable decay length , an accurate measurement of the locations of the displaced vertices can be used to provide additional constraints . here",
    "we assume that all of the decays occur on a microscopic length scale before the nlsp s travel a finite macroscopic distance and decay to a pair of invisible lsp s and a pair of visible sm particles .",
    "this implies that the direction of the nlsp 3-momentum is equal to the unit vector pointing in the direction of the secondary vertex .",
    "the nlsp unit 3-momentum contains two degrees of freedom , thus an accurate measurement of two displaced vertices will allow us to subtract off another @xmath20 unknowns . in some situations , it will not be possible to measure the locations of the displaced vertices and only the trajectories of the displaced tracks will be visible . in these situations ,",
    "the locations of the secondary vertices can be constrained to lie on the trajectories of the displaced tracks and can be parameterized by one number thus removing @xmath21 unknown quantities .",
    "in this section we propose a parameterization of the unknown quantities that makes the utility of displaced vertices and displaced tracks maximally transparent .",
    "more specifically , we will show that it will be possible to write down an expression for the 3-momenta of each lsp that depends only the location of the displaced vertices . throughout this analysis",

    "they would therefore be useful for very early discovery level searches at the lhc .",

    "r - parity must be ( approximately ) preserved guaranteeing the stability of the lsp 2 .   decays to the lsp must occur before the cascade reaches the detector 3 .",

    "since displaced tracks are assumed to be measurable in experiments , but 4-momenta of gravitino and slepton are not , we would use the track information and forget the momenta information for the later analysis .",
    "also , the transverse missing energy is assumed to be only coming from two gravitinos , thus it can be calculated when we prepare the mc information .",
    "one needs to be very careful on what information is accessible and what is not .",
    "we summarize the accessible information as following : the location of primary vertex , the beginning and ending points of the two displaced tracks for each event , the 4-momenta of each displaced track , and transverse missing energy . except for those ,",

    "after we finish the preparation of mc information , we proceed the scanning in possible location of 2nd vertex along one of the displaced tracks .",
    "the scanning we do is taking a constant step along the track .",
    "the calculation of weighting factor for each scanning point is a little tricky , because part of the information of exponential decay has already been included in the distribution of displaced tracks .",
    "thus the uniform step of scanning along each tracks in many events is not giving us a uniform distribution of points in space .",
    "to gain the correct weighting factor , one has to first include a weighting factor of each displaced track .",

    "<S> if physics beyond the standard model contains metastable new particle states , its signatures may manifest themselves at the lhc through the presence of displaced vertices or displaced tracks . </S>",
    "<S> such signatures are common in low - scale supersymmetry breaking scenarios as well as a host of other well - studied new physics models . here </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the kinematics of dual cascade decays with missing energy resulting from a stable non - interacting new particle state at the bottom of the decay chain . </S>",
    "<S> we find that if the final step of the decay chain involves a metastable particle , the resulting presence of displaced tracks provides strong constraints with which to solve for the unknown kinematic quantities lost through missing energy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we develop techniques with which to recover all kinematic unknowns , even in situations where the unknown quantities outnumber the constraints . </S>",
    "<S> these techniques can all be performed using a very small number of events and can thus be applied to very early discovery level searches at the lhc .    </S>",
