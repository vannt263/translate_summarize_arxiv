    "<S> a metal - insulator transition was induced by in - plane magnetic fields up to 27 t in homogeneously sb - doped si / sige superlattice structures . </S>",
    "<S> the localisation is not observed for perpendicular magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with magnetoconductivity investigations in the weakly localised regime shows that the delocalising effect originates from the interaction - induced spin - triplet term in the particle - hole diffusion channel . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that this term , possibly together with the singlet particle - particle contribution , is of general importance in disordered n - type si bulk and heterostructures . </S>",
    "<S> +   + keywords : a. disordered systems , a. quantum wells , d. electron - electron interaction , d. order - disorder effects , d. quantum localisation +    due to the sensitivity to external perturbations and the possibility of controlling the randomness , doped semiconductors and semiconductor structures have proven to be excellent media to examine the nature of localisation in disordered electronic systems.@xcite in particular , the remarkable studies @xcite of bulk si : p have demonstrated that the doping  induced metal  </S>",
    "<S> insulator transition is continuous , and that the effects of backscattering and disorder  modified electron  electron interaction are equally important at the localisation boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the latter was confirmed by investigations @xcite of interfacial electron layers in si mos - fets , which indicate that all states are localised in disordered two  dimensional ( 2d ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite while the corresponding theoretical predictions have found detailed quantitative verifications in a number of experimental studies on various semiconductor compounds and disordered metals , the case of n - si , @xcite and more recently of high mobility si mos - fets , @xcite have demonstrated unsatisfactory understanding of the si - based systems . </S>",
    "<S> extensive theoretical studies @xcite re - emphasise the peculiar properties of n - si , where the weakness of spin - dependent scattering  associated with the lightness of the constituting atoms , the presence of inversion symmetry in the diamond lattice , and the low degree of compensation  makes the anti - localising interaction terms in the conductivity corrections particularly large .    </S>",
    "<S> even more surprising are perhaps the results by kravchenko et al . , </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which point to the existence of a metallic phase in high electron - mobility si mos - fets at zero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> several suggestions on the origin of this unforeseen metallic phase in that 2d system have been put forward : ( i ) coulomb interactions of remote electrons , @xcite ( ii ) superconductivity due to spin - triplet pairing , @xcite ( iii ) non - fermi liquid behaviour driven by effects of electron - electron interactions , @xcite and ( iv ) the existence of a spin - orbit gap due to a strongly asymmetric confining potential in si - mos structures . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in most recent experimental works @xcite the suppression of the low temperature conducting phase by an in - plane magnetic field was demonstrated , which indicates the importance of spin - related terms .    here , </S>",
    "<S> we report about millikelvin studies of in - plane conductivity up to magnetic fields of 27 t for uniformly sb - doped si / sige superlattices ( sls ) . in our si / sige sls </S>",
    "<S> , the six fold valley degeneracy of the si conduction band is removed due to the biaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> for the two ground state valleys the in - plane effective mass is nearly by a factor of 5 smaller than the longitudinal mass . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical transport mobility is in addition strongly reduced by the weak coupling through the sige barriers , resulting in a rather large anisotropy of electron transport . at the same time , the electron land factor is expected to be isotropic and close to its value in bulk n - si , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the magnetoresistance studies , which we carried out for the two orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the sl interfaces , make it possible to determine the relative importance of the orbital and spin effects . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm that electron delocalisation in si - based materials at the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) is driven by spin - dependent phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we assign these phenomena to the presence of anti - localisation terms in the quantum corrections to the conductivity of disordered systems . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling </S>",
    "<S> , such spin - dependent terms may arise from the triplet particle - hole and singlet particle - particle diffusion channels of the disorder - modified electron - electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the sl structures were grown by mbe on ( 001 ) si substrates with a sige graded buffer layer . </S>",
    "<S> each of the sls consist of 150 periods of si wells ( @xmath1  ) and si@xmath2ge@xmath3 barriers ( @xmath4  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity densities in our samples , @xmath5 @xmath6 , 4.5 , and 6 , cover the range around the critical concentration of @xmath7 for the mit in bulk si : sb . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the structural properties of the sls were determined by high resolution x - ray diffraction , whereas the ge and sb concentrations and their homogeneity were checked by secondary ion mass spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> resistivity and hall effect measurements between 10 and 300 k show only a small change of the hall constant with temperature , and lead to an agreement between electron densities and sb doping levels within 5% .    </S>",
    "<S> previous investigations of our structures , carried out in the magnetic fields up to 9 t , have demonstrated that electron conductivity retains features of 3d transport , despite that the miniband width @xmath8 is more than 10 times smaller than the in - plane momentum relaxation rate @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in particular , the magnetoconductivity at 1.5 k in the weakly localised regime can be described by the theory for a disordered 3d electronic system with an anisotropic diffusion tensor . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the present magnetoresistance studies were carried out in a dilution refrigerator , installed either in a superconductive 9 t coil or in a hybrid magnet capable of 27 t. it has been found in the course of this work that the temperature ( and phase coherence ) of the conducting electrons in the studied structures are strongly affected by high frequency electromagnetic noise . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the electrons in si / sige are less resistant to electron heating than in zinc - blend compounds . in the latter , the piezoelectric coupling , due to its energy loss rate which is proportional to @xmath10 , results in better electron cooling than that in the elemental semiconductors , in which only the interaction by deformation potential , characterised by @xmath11-dependence , is effective at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite here @xmath12 denotes the electron and @xmath13 the lattice temperature .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the temperature dependence of the in - plane conductivity is shown for two si / sige sls at zero magnetic field . for the highest doping level ( @xmath14 ) an increasing conductivity with decreasing temperature </S>",
    "<S> is observed ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this metallic behaviour is well described by the dependence @xmath15 , where @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest doped sl with @xmath17 shows ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) , in turn , a strong drop of the conductivity on decreasing temperature , which can be described by @xmath18 with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence points to a variable - range hopping conductivity , and thus shows that the sample is on the insulator side of the mit . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath20 is expected for 3d systems , depending on the shape of the coulomb gap . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the temperature dependence of the conductivity in the absence of a magnetic field proves , therefore , the presence of the doping  induced mit in the si / sige : sb sl system . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the observed increase of the conductivity at the lowest temperature demonstrates that in the highest doped sample the anti - localisation interaction terms dominate over other quantum corrections to the conductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> results of detailed low - temperature conductivity studies of the @xmath21 sl up to magnetic fields of 27 t are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the orientation of the magnetic field was chosen to be either parallel ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) or perpendicular ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) to the sl layers . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the measurement current was perpendicular to the magnetic field . in the case of sufficiently strong parallel magnetic fields , the in  plane conductivity ( inverse in  </S>",
    "<S> plane resistivity ) @xmath22 extrapolated to zero temperature vanishes in the @xmath23 presentation of fig . 2a , and thus shows a magnetic - field induced mit . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath22 , a @xmath23 dependence , characteristic for 3d systems in the magnetic field , @xcite is visible over a wide temperature and field range . </S>",
    "<S> however , because the quantum corrections to the conductivity of anisotropic systems are proportional to the ratio of the diffusion constant along the current to the average one,@xcite the magnitude of d@xmath22/d@xmath23 in n - si / sige sls at criticality is found to be by about a factor of 8 greater than in bulk n - si . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this makes the extrapolation to @xmath24 unusually inaccurate in our system and precludes an accurate determination of the critical magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the @xmath21 sample , the @xmath25 sample does not show a mit in the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated zero-@xmath26 conductivity @xmath22 decreases gradually with the in - plane magnetic field but remains non - zero up to 27 t.    in the case of perpendicular geometry ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) the decrease in conductivity with increasing magnetic field is much weaker than for the parallel orientation , so that no mit is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated zero-@xmath26 value of @xmath22 does not vanish up to 12 t for the @xmath21 sl . for higher magnetic fields </S>",
    "<S> , however , the conductivity does not decrease monotonically any more . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , this region is not displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b as the overlapping curves would not give a clear picture . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b , in the range of high perpendicular magnetic fields , the resistivity exhibits a broad minimum around 21 t which is consistent with a shubnikov - de haas oscillation or a quantum hall state at a filling factor @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of quantum hall states is possible in the case of weakly coupled wells in a superlattice structure . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the existence of quantum hall plateaux could not , however , be proved in our structures , as the hall voltage is much smaller than the longitudinal voltage in these low mobility samples .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the occurrence of the transition for @xmath28 _ parallel _ to the interface planes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) , and its absence in the perpendicular configuration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) proves rather directly that the field  induced mit in n - si @xcite is driven by a spin mechanism , not by an orbital effect . </S>",
    "<S> the spin mechanism operates at any orientation of the magnetic field but , according to our studies in the weakly localised regime,@xcite its contribution in the perpendicular geometry is partly compensated by an orbital effect . </S>",
    "<S> the latter was assigned@xcite to the destructive influence of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field upon the single - electron interference of self - crossing trajectories.@xcite owing to the low mobility of the electrons in our structures , the interference effect compensate the positive magnetoresistance over a wider field range in si / sige : sb sls than in high mobility si - mosfets . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted however that the actual nature of the metallic ground state in si - mosfets is unknown .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth comparing the behaviour of si - based structures to materials with a much larger ratio of the cyclotron to zeeman energy , such as n - gaas . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the field on the single - electron interference was shown to drive barely insulating n - gaalas to the metallic phase.@xcite in sufficiently strong fields , in turn , a field - induced localisation is observed , which in the metallic n - gaas / algaas sls occurs at smaller magnetic fields when the field is oriented _ perpendicular _ to the interface.@xcite this suggests that an orbital effect , such as the diamagnetic lowering of the carrier kinetic energy by the magnetic field , @xcite accounts for the mit in n - gaas - based systems </S>",
    "<S> .    a least - square fit to all data for the @xmath21 sample between 100 and 500 mk in both parallel and perpendicular configurations was performed by the dependence @xmath29 . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the exponent @xmath30 is @xmath31 at zero or weak magnetic fields , which can be compared with @xmath32 , as found in a recent study of n - ge near the mit . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite between 0.5 and 1.5 t a nearly step like increase to @xmath33 takes place . in this region </S>",
    "<S> the spin splitting @xmath34 becomes greater than the energy of thermal broadening @xmath35 , and thus a cross - over to a different universality class is expected . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a change of the universality class is also confirmed @xcite by replotting the experimental results between 0.8 and 1.4 t in coordinates suggested by the finkelstein renormalization group approach @xcite for the mit driven by the disorder - modified electron - electron interactions . because of a strong dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath26 our data are particularly sensitive to the value of the dynamic exponent @xmath36 , and give @xmath37 in the magnetic field . a similar analysis for bulk n - si at @xmath38 yielded @xmath39 , @xcite while that for the mit of spin - polarised electrons in diluted magnetic semiconductors resulted in @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the values of @xmath30 and @xmath36 quoted above indicate that n - si and n - ge belong to the same universality class whereas diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite and n - si in the magnetic field @xcite form another one . </S>",
    "<S> since the electrons in the minority - spin band become localised and decoupled from from the majority - spin carriers already on the metal side of the mit , we suggest that the corresponding universality class is rather `` spin polarised '' @xcite than `` strong magnetic field''.@xcite    in conclusion , the magnetic field - induced metal - insulator transition in si / sige superlattice structures doped with sb is observed for the magnetic field that is parallel to the sl interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of the transition in the case of the perpendicular magnetic fields shows rather directly that spin effects are crucial . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the conductivity at criticality , together with detailed studies of the magnetoconductivity in the weakly localised regime , @xcite demonstrate that the dominant contribution comes from the anti - localising triplet diffusion term of the disorder - modified electron - electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this term , perhaps together with the singlet cooperon contribution , plays also an important role in the high mobility si - mos structures , where an unexpected 2d - metallic state has been observed and shown to be destroyed by the parallel magnetic fields . </S>"
