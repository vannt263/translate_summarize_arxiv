    "the first observation of single photons by the wa98 collaboration at cern sps is considered as a well anticipated turning point in the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions using electromagnetic probes  @xcite . earlier observations like the one by the wa80  @xcite collaboration , provided only a useful upper limit of this study ( for recent developments in the field of direct photon production from relativistic heavy ion collisions , see ref .",
    "the study of electromagnetic radiations , and in particular photons , as a probe of heavy ion collisions is advantageous compared to the study of hadrons , for two main reasons .",
    "first of all , photons are emitted from each and every stage of the expanding system , whereas hadrons are emitted only from the surface of freeze - out after suffering strong interactions .",
    "secondly , photons do not suffer final state interaction ( for being electromagnetic in nature , their mean free path is larger than the system size ) and carry undistorted information from the production point to the detector .",
    "the major problem in the study of single photons from heavy ion collisions arises from the very small signal to background ratio .",
    "however , recent developments in the background subtraction methods have reduced the size of error bars in the direct to decay ratio for photons considerably .",
    "we reanalyze the single photon wa98 data by incorporating several new improvements in our understanding of prompt photon production from heavy ion collisions and considering the latest developments in the field of thermal photon production along with a well defined equation of state and suitable initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "the study of prompt photon production in @xmath2 collisions has reached a higher level of sophistication and all the available data have now been successfully analyzed with nlo pqcd treatment  @xcite without the inclusion of intrinsic @xmath3 for protons .",
    "in particular , the suppression of single photons at large @xmath4 for au+au collisions with respect to the single photons resulting from @xmath2 collisions at the same nucleon - nucleon center of mass energy may be largely due to the difference in valence quark structure of protons and neutrons @xcite .",

    "experimental results for e704  @xcite for p+p collisions and those estimated from @xmath6 collisions by e629  @xcite and na3  @xcite experiments are given for a comparison .",

    "we calculate the prompt photon production from @xmath2 collisions using nlo pqcd treatment along with an optimized scale for factorization , fragmentation and renormalization ( all equal to @xmath8 ) at @xmath9 gev ( without introducing intrinsic @xmath3 ) and compare our results with various experimental data available at that energy ( with proper mass number normalization for @xmath10 collisions ) .",
    "this comparison is done as no experimental data are available for @xmath2 or @xmath11 collisions at the wa98 center of mass energy ( @xmath12 gev ) and the available data at the closest center of mass energy is at @xmath13 gev [ see left panel of fig .  [ pp ] ] .",
    "we see that the photons originating from fragmentation are about 30% of those produced from compton+annihilation processes .",
    "our result using nlo pqcd matches well with the na3  @xcite data , while it underestimates the e704  @xcite and e629  @xcite data , same as reported by earlier studies .    for prompt photon production from 158a gev pb+pb collisions , isospin and shadowing",
    "@xcite corrected nlo pqcd treatment is used with the same scaling factor of @xmath8 for factorization , fragmentation and renormalization .",
    "the effect of isospin and shadowing on photon production from heavy ion collisions are investigated by calculating nuclear modification factor ( @xmath14 ) as function of @xmath4 and @xmath15 for different beam energies .",
    "results for p+p normalized @xmath14 as a function of @xmath4 for p+n , n+n , and pb+pb collisions are shown in right panel of fig .",
    "we see that the photon production from pb+pb collisions is suppressed significantly in the intermediate and high @xmath4 range , compared to the production from p+p collisions .",

    "the initial energy density profile is taken as proportional to the number of wounded nucleons and five different values of @xmath20 are considered ranging from 0.2 fm/@xmath17 to 1.0 fm/@xmath17 ( in steps of 0.2 fm/@xmath17 ) keeping the total entropy of the system fixed .",
    "the time evolution of average energy density @xmath21 , average temperature @xmath22 and average radial flow velocity @xmath23 at different @xmath20 are compared .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath21 ( @xmath24 ) changes significantly at large @xmath25 with changing values of @xmath20 , whereas @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not affected much [ see ref .",

    "we find that the prompt photon production is about 17% of the total yield measured by wa98 and the thermal photon result is almost similar to prompt photon production at @xmath28 fm/@xmath17 .",
    "we also note that the thermal photons from hadronic phase are not affected significantly with changing @xmath20 .",
    "a quantitative description of the wa98 experimental data is obtained by using the relation @xmath29 where , @xmath1 is adjusted to reproduce the photon production at @xmath30 gev/@xmath17 . for all @xmath20 ,",
    "a normalization at the same @xmath4 (= 2.55 gev/@xmath17 ) provides a good description of the data in the entire @xmath4 range .",
    "we find that the scaling factors @xmath18 2.7 , 4.9 , 5.4 , 5.7 , and 5.9 for prompt photons at @xmath31 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , and 1.0 fm/@xmath17 respectively provide a good quantitative agreement with the wa98 data [ shown in fig .",
    "[ sps ] ] .",
    "we argue that the factor @xmath1 for prompt photons accounts for the cronin effect , in the case of nucleus - nucleus collisions , as well as a pre - equilibrium contribution which must surely be included when @xmath20 is large .      in a potentially interesting observation",
    "we show that , one additional experimental result , i.e , the elliptic flow for thermal photons  @xcite could actually distinguish between the different values of @xmath20 .",
    "the elliptic flow results for different @xmath20 along with the hadronic matter contribution for 158a gev pb+pb collisions at cern sps are shown in right panel of fig .",
    "we note that several earlier studies have explained the wa98 data considering only the formation a hot hadronic gas in the collision and without the formation of qgp phase  @xcite .",
    "the estimation of photon flow at sps can distinguish between the two scenarios of ` with ' and ` without ' phase transitions as the nature of @xmath32 would be completely different in the two cases .",
    "we also compute the particle spectra and @xmath33 for several hadrons and show explicitly that both the spectra and elliptic flow results remain unaffected with changing values of @xmath20 for hadrons .",
