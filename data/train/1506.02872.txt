    "the spontaneous electric polarization of polar materials causes surface charges , or band bending near the surface . if the band bending is large enough for the conduction and valence bands to cross the fermi level , two - dimensional ( 2d ) positive carriers can emerge at one side of a material and negative ones at the other side .",
    "such mobile carriers , if realized , expand an arena of 2d - carrier systems that exhibit a wide variety of quantum phenomena  @xcite .",
    "a pioneering work on batio@xmath2 claimed that the electric conductivity was increased by the polarization  @xcite .",
    "however , carrier polarities were not shown and thus their relationship with the polarization is unclear . to clarify the relationship , it is necessary to carefully examine surface modifications , as emphasized in ref .  .",
    "for example , oxygen vacancies created on the fractured surface produce a 2d electron gas at the surface of srtio@xmath2 ( ref .  ) .",
    "in contrast to the simple mechanism , it has never been established whether the spontaneous electric polarization actually induces 2d carriers .",
    "a polar semiconductor bitei is an emergent candidate possessing the polarization - induced 2d carriers .",
    "bitei has a layered crystal structure with triple layers composed of te , bi , and i layers stacking along the @xmath3-axis  @xcite , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : bitei](a ) . in this polar crystal structure , the spin degeneracy in the band structures",
    "is lifted by spin - orbit interaction  @xcite .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) reveals that bitei indeed exhibits momentum - dependent ( rashba - type ) spin splitting larger than ever reported  @xcite .",
    "because of this feature , bitei is proposed as a component for spintronics applications  @xcite . in addition , both @xmath1-type and @xmath0-type two - dimensional ( 2d ) band dispersions are observed at the surface of bitei  @xcite . although preceding studies have shown the presence of band bending near the surface accompanied with the surface carriers  @xcite , the origin of the band bending ( and thus the origin of the surface carriers ) remains elusive .",

    "in contrast to these surface origins , butler _",
    "_ speculate that the spontaneous electric polarization in the bulk causes the spectral shift to discuss the surface structures  @xcite . actually , the surface structure necessary to identify the origin is also still obscure .",
    "multiple termination layers hosting the ambipolar carriers are attributed to stacking faults ( an excess or deficiency of an atomic layer ) and steps  @xcite , or opposite stacking sequences  @xcite .",
    "surface vacancies or absorbates have not been addressed in the preceding microscopy  @xcite .    in this study , we substantiate that the ambipolar 2d carriers at the surface of bitei are induced by the spontaneous electric polarization .",
    "a core challenge , defined by the previous studies , is to elucidate local electronic states including carrier polarities , together with surface structures from submicron- to atomic- scales . for this purpose , we performed spectroscopic - imaging scanning tunneling microscopy ( si - stm ) which yields images of the local density of states ( ldos ) by measuring spatial variation of the differential tunneling conductance , d@xmath4/d@xmath5 . to determine local carrier polarity , we exploit electron standing waves appearing as spatial modulations in d@xmath4/d@xmath5 images  @xcite .",
    "an electron standing wave is caused by quantum interference between electron waves incident to and elastically scattered from an atomic defect or step .",
    "the wavevector of electron standing wave is given as difference between those of original electron waves , @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the dispersion relationship @xmath7 , specifically the sign of d@xmath8/d@xmath5 , directly reflects carrier polarity : negative for holes and positive for electrons .",
    "single crystals of pristine and substituted bitei used in this study were grown by a modified bridgman method  @xcite .",
    "all samples are doped with electrons due to non - stoichiometry .",
    "bulk electron densities are determined by the hall coefficient measured at room temperature .",

    "the fermi levels of @xmath9 @xmath10 samples lie @xmath110.1 ev above the bulk conduction band minimum  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , since the @xmath12 @xmath10 samples are not fully metallic and have the fermi levels near the bulk conduction band minimum , their electron densities at low temperatures where si - stm measurements were performed may be smaller than those at room temperature .",
    "therefore , the 0.1 ev difference of the fermi levels and the two orders of magnitude difference of the bulk electron densities are the minimum estimates of those at low temperatures .    for si - stm measurements",
    ", bitei crystals were cleaved in an ultra - high vacuum chamber at @xmath1177  k. the crystals were then immediately transferred with a transfer rod cooled together with the crystals , through an insert cooled by liquid helium , to a home - built stm head placed at the bottom of the insert and cooled down to 4.6  k beforehand .",
    "all si - stm measurements were carried out at 4.6  k with tungsten tips sharpened electrochemically and prepared with a field ion microscope .",
    "bias voltages were applied to the sample and the tip was virtually grounded .",
    "topographic images were taken in the constant - current mode .",

    "is the two types of domains identified topographically and electronically as described below .",
    "the domains are typically several hundred nanometers in size and separated by depression in topographic images .",
    "the domain boundaries are not straight along the crystalline axes but meandering smoothly .",
    "one type of the domains is apparently higher than the other by about 0.1  nm , which weakly depends on bias voltages ( appendix  [ appendix : relativeheight ] ) .",
    "the bias dependence means that the topmost layers of the domains are crystallographically inequivalent .",
    "a topographic distinction between the two types of domains is defect patterns appearing in high - resolution topographic images shown in fig .",

    "more details about the domain structure are brought by further investigating topographic images .",
    "first , stacking sequences of each domain are i - top for fig .",

    "these thorough identifications of the domain structure play an important role to understand electronic states of each domain as described below .",
    "an electronic distinction between the two types of domains is represented by d@xmath4/d@xmath5 spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bitei](e ) .",
    "the spectrum of the te - top domain shows finite conductance in the voltage range studied whereas that of the i - top domain shows vanishingly small conductance at positive bias voltages .",
    "the latter implies that , at the surface of the i - top domain , the top of valence band is located slightly above the fermi level and thus the charge carriers are holes in contrast to electrons in the bulk . d@xmath4/d@xmath5 images also clearly manifest the distinction as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : bitei](e ) , a 2d hole gas is formed at the surface of the i - top domain .",
    "meanwhile in the te - top domain , the dispersion relationship is completely different from that in the i - top domain . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpi](g ) and [ fig : qpi](h ) , two dispersive branches are observed .",

    "the high - symmetry linecuts shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpi](i)-[fig : qpi](l ) exhibit that these branches have positive slope ( d@xmath8/d@xmath20 ) and cross 0  mv . therefore , the surface carriers of the te - top domain are electrons . an energy - independent feature appearing on the outside of the outer branch",
    "is an extrinsic feature inherent to si - stm because its location changes depending on setup bias voltages  @xcite .",
    "we note that the identification of the top layer and corresponding dispersion relationships are consistent with the arpes results  @xcite .        the clear electron standing waves in the te - top domain bear closer analyses to unveil the nature of the electronic state .",
    "the presence of two branches indicates that two scattering channels connecting non - orthogonal electronic states are involved with the electron standing waves  @xcite . by comparing the observed dispersions with the arpes results  @xcite",
    ", we assign the scattering channels in the te - top domain as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpi](m ) .",
    "the inner branch arises from inter - band scattering between the spin - split bands as had ever been observed for rashba - split states  @xcite .",
    "the outer branch originates from intra - band scattering in the hexagonally - warped outer band .",
    "this branch emerges , as known for the surface dirac fermions of topological insulators  @xcite , because of a non - zero out - of - plane component of the spin polarization that is characteristic of @xmath14-symmetry of the crystal lattice  @xcite . given this assignment of the two branches",
    ", we can estimate the momentum offset of the spin - split bands at ( @xmath21  nm@xmath22 .",
    "this value agrees well with the arpes results  @xcite .",
    "the spin splitting is observable in the electron standing waves of spin - split bands ( without scattering to additional bands@xcite ) when the band structure deviates from a simple rashba model of a theoretical prediction  @xcite and is hexagonally warped .",
    "the most salient feature of the electron standing waves in the te - top domain is found in relationship to bulk electron density , @xmath1 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : independent](a)-[fig : independent](d ) , the fourier transforms of d@xmath4/d@xmath5 images reveal that the wavevectors of two branches are independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this feature was commonly observed in the samples studied and thus is also independent of details of the domain structures .",
    "the constant wavevector means that , as the fermi level shifts as @xmath1 changes ( @xmath110.1  ev for the @xmath1 range studied  @xcite ) , the surface band also shifts such that the fermi wavelength of the surface 2d state stays constant . as indicated by the constant fermi wavelength ,",
    "the electron densities at the surface stay constant , even though those in the bulk change by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the surface electron density is roughly estimated at @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the peculiar @xmath1-independence is essential for specifying the mechanism of the 2d carriers as discussed below .",
    "the electron standing waves are also observed around the domain boundary , providing details of the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction at the boundary .",
    "[ fig : pn](a ) and [ fig : pn](b ) show a topographic and a d@xmath4/d@xmath5 image taken in the same area around a domain boundary  @xcite . to highlight atomic - scale structures",
    ", we apply a fourier filter suppressing long - wavelength structures . a structural model of the boundary",
    "is suggested from a filtered topographic image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn](c ) .",
    "( see appendix  [ appendix : model ] for details . )",
    "the electron standing waves in both domains are better visualized in a filtered d@xmath4/d@xmath5 image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn](d )  @xcite , indicating that this @xmath0-@xmath1 junction is a tunnel diode between highly - doped semiconductors .",
    "the depletion layer of the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction manifests itself as the intervening zone without electron standing waves in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn](d ) .",
    "transition of the electronic states across the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn](e ) .",
    "d@xmath4/d@xmath5 spectral variation occurs in the intervening zone , defining the depletion layer .",
    "the width of depletion layer is about 6  nm , in agreement with a simple estimate .",
    "( see appendix  [ appendix : width ] for details . )",
    "the depression observed in the topographic image corresponds to the depletion layer .",
    "the work function has three characteristics ; it has larger value in the i - top domain , shows larger modulations in the i - top domain , and changes solely in the te - top domain side of the depletion layer .",
    "the larger value is related to the origin of the ambipolar 2d carriers as described later as well as apparent heights of the domains ( appendix  [ appendix : apparentheight ] ) .",
    "further analysis is required for the larger modulations and the asymmetric change .",
    "how can the ambipolar 2d carriers be induced at the surface of bitei ? the key ingredient to specify the origin is the peculiar constant density of the 2d electrons .",
    "similar constant density is reported for srtio@xmath2 where the 2d electrons are attributed to surface oxygen vacancies  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the density of oxygen vacancies at the surface is much larger than and virtually independent of that in the bulk .",
    "in contrast , however , extrinsic surface modifications are not observed in our samples ( appendix  [ sec : nodefect ] ) and therefore excluded as the origin of the 2d carriers .",
    "instead , the constant density in bitei is naturally explained by the spontaneous electric polarization in the bulk .",
    "the unit bitei layer consists of a positively - charged ( bite)@xmath25 bilayer and a negatively - charged i@xmath26 layer  @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous electric polarization therefore directs from a bite bilayer to an i layer within the unit layer .",
    "the conduction ( valence ) band then is bent negatively ( positively ) and split off to form a 2d electron ( hole ) gas at the surface of the te - top ( i - top ) domain , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : independent](e ) . since the density of accumulated 2d electrons is determined by strength of the polarization , it is independent of bulk electron density .",
    "the other observations are also comprehensively understood by the spontaneous electric polarization .",
    "the work function larger in the i - top domain is consistent with stronger confinement of electrons into the bulk caused by the spontaneous electric polarization pointing from a bite bilayer to an i layer . the strong scattering at bi - site ( te - site ) in the te - top ( i - top ) domain reflects the orbital character of the surface band split from the conduction ( valence ) band where bi-6p ( te-5p ) orbitals predominantly contribute  @xcite .",
    "the domain structure with the @xmath16 relationship and the meandering boundaries is analogous with those of displacive - type ferroelectrics .",
    "we thus conclude that the ambipolar 2d carriers at bitei surfaces are induced by the spontaneous electric polarization in the bulk .    in this study , we have precisely determined local carrier polarity by observing electron standing waves with si - stm .",
    "this results demonstrates that , to probe carrier polarity , si - stm is available complementarily to other techniques such as arpes , thermoelectric probes , single electron transistors , and photoelectron emission microscopy .",
    "moreover , we unveiled that the underlying mechanism of electron standing waves is common to that of dirac fermions in topological insulators .",
    "this enables us to examine rashba - type spin splitting with si - stm and provides a unified framework to address spin - dependent scattering phenomena that are a key aspect for spintronics applications .",
    "most importantly , our study establishes that the spontaneous electric polarization induces ambipolar 2d carriers .",
    "carrier densities of these 2d carriers may be controlled by strain and temperature via the piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects . since the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction at the domain boundary is a consequence of the ambipolar 2d carriers and the domain structure sharing the common root , the surface of a polar material is a new platform to investigate a lateral @xmath0-@xmath1 junction of 2d carriers .",
    "such a surface can be a potential substructure to study unconventional devices such as a topological @xmath0-@xmath1 junction  @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous electric polarization is , as a means to induce 2d carriers , complementary to field effect transistors and heterostructures in the sense that the induced carriers are non - volatile and polarity - switchable , and thus is available to explore new phenomena and functionalities .",

    "apparent heights of the two types of domains depend on the bias voltages as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dbtopo ] , indicating that the electronic states at the surfaces of the domains are different and the electronic difference contributes to the difference of apparent heights .",

    "the experimental fact that _ only two _ kinds of domains are observed means that number of surface structures is two . if there are multiple cleavage planes in the ideal crystal structure , more than two kinds of surface structures appear due to combinations of the topmost and subsurface layers .",
    "stacking faults also give more than two kinds of surface structures for the same reason .",
    "multiple cleavage planes and stacking faults are excluded also by the step heights that are multiples of the @xmath3-axis lattice constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : steptopo ] ) .",
    "then , the topmost layer of each domain must be one of the two layers adjacent to the natural cleavage plane , and the second - topmost layer must be one remaining layer .",

    "that is , the observed domain structures are composed of opposite stacking sequences , te - bi - i ( te - top ) and i - bi - te ( i - top ) .",

    "<S> two - dimensional ( 2d ) mobile carriers are a wellspring of quantum phenomena . among various 2d - carrier systems , such as field effect transistors and heterostructures , polar materials hold a unique potential ; the spontaneous electric polarization in the bulk could generate positive and negative 2d carriers at the surface . </S>",
    "<S> although several experiments have shown ambipolar carriers at the surface of a polar semiconductor bitei , their origin is yet to be specified . </S>",
    "<S> here we provide compelling experimental evidences that the ambipolar 2d carriers at the surface of bitei are induced by the spontaneous electric polarization . by imaging electron standing waves with spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy , we find that positive or negative carriers with rashba - type spin splitting emerge at the surface correspondingly to the polar directions in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the electron densities at the surface are constant independently of those in the bulk , corroborating that the 2d carriers are induced by the spontaneous electric polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we also successfully image that lateral @xmath0-@xmath1 junctions are formed along the boundaries of submicron - scale domains with opposite polar directions . </S>",
    "<S> our study presents a novel means to endow non - volatile , spin - polarized , and ambipolar 2d carriers as well as , without elaborate fabrication , lateral @xmath0-@xmath1 junctions of those carriers at atomically - sharp interfaces . </S>"
