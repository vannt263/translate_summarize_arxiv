    "description of propagation phenomena has been one of the most prolific field in complex network theory , mostly because of the range of possible applications : epidemic control , spread of information , virus or pollutant propagation in electronic or biological networks @xcite .",
    "most analytical models are based on the random network ( rn ) paradigm : from the point of view of the propagating agent , random networks are seen as identical for every newly infected individual because of their treelike structure ( i.e. no loops ) .",
    "this approach has given rise to different descriptions : some are based on a compartmentalisation of nodes according to their state @xcite , others on the generating function formalism @xcite or hybrid descriptions using mean - field theory @xcite ; yet all approaches are difficult to generalize to real networks for which the rn paradigm rarely applies .",
    "the importance of topology for propagation dynamics @xcite , and more specifically , the importance of clustering @xcite , is now well established .",
    "that is , the dynamics on the network is far from independent on how links are arranged between its elements .",
    "furthermore , most real networks feature a significant amount of substructures that simply can not be ignored as they define the very identity of the networks",
    ". the multi - protein units of molecular biology @xcite , the coupling of a given set of stocks @xcite or groups of highly connected individuals @xcite are all good examples of how precise mechanisms ( e.g. the friend of my friend is my friend ) give rise to important structures within a seemingly random topology .",
    "the two limits of complex networks , complete randomness and perfect order , can be treated with the previously discussed methods .",
    "we will concentrate on those particular complex networks , located somewhere between order and disorder , and show how their topology can be taken into account in dynamical problems .",
    "in doing so , the language of social networks and epidemics will be used to take advantage of its eloquence and clarity .",
    "it should be clear however that the formalism developped is general to many types of networks and propagation phenomena .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the particular topology chosen to illustrate our approach , the community structure ( cs ) , is described in sec .",
    "[ section : cs ] .",
    "the analytical model is then developed in sec .",
    "[ section : main ] where we also obtain analytical solutions for the equilibria and epidemic threshold of the system .",
    "section [ section : results ] compares our analytical results with numerical monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations and presents discussions of our findings . after presenting our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ section : conclu ] , an appendix completes our analysis of propagation phenomena on community structure .",
    "in what follows , a new approach to describe dynamical problems on complex topologies will be used to solve a disease propagation model on social networks featuring a well - known topology : the community structure .",
    "we define this particular arrangement of nodes by their aggregation in highly connected groups . these communities ( or cliques )",
    "can virtually represent a person s family , workplace , collection of friends , etc .",
    "this simple concept results in a network with highly connected communities and a sparser density of links between them ( see fig . [ schema ] ) .",
    "the topology of such networks has been studied at some length : for its initial description , see @xcite ; for its statistical significance , see @xcite ; for its detection or characterisation , see @xcite ; and the references therein for an exhaustive presentation .",
    "unfortunately , not unlike other complex types of networks , studies of dynamical processes on this topology has been mainly limited to numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "albeit useful to estimate its effect on the dynamics , they lack the clarity of an analytical framework . on the other hand , mean - field description of propagation phenomena in terms of communities ( or households ) has been previously attempted in @xcite with several shortcomings such as homogeneous topology , lack of the concept of individuals or inefficient moment closure approximations .",
    "hence , there is a need for an analytical approach that can accurately take into account the many complexities of social networks in order to describe the time evolution of the system .",
    "because community structure typically includes clustering and degree correlation , our formalism will include the coherent contribution of both properties .",
    "a useful model of social topology was published by newman in @xcite .",
    "the networks are constructed as follows : each individual belongs to @xmath0 cliques and each clique holds @xmath1 individuals , where both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are taken from given distributions . within every clique ,",
    "each pair of members has a probability @xmath2 of being acquainted .",
    "hence , the entire topology is defined by one parameter @xmath2 and two probability distributions @xmath3 and @xmath4 generated by the following probability generating functions ( pgfs ) : @xmath5 which are simply built from the probabilities @xmath6 and @xmath7 that a random clique or individual will have @xmath1 participants or @xmath0 cliques respectively .",
    "similar functions can be defined to generate the probabilities that a random clique of a random individual is shared by @xmath8 other participants or that a random individual in a random clique participates in @xmath9 other cliques .",
    "we simply note that these quantities are proportional to @xmath10 or @xmath11 and thus find our second set of pgfs : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the mean numbers of individuals per clique and cliques per individual used to normalize the distributions .",
    "note that the mean of a distributed quantity is simply given by the derivative of the corresponding pgf evaluated at unity .",
    "the following topological properties have already been derived in @xcite and @xcite : degree distribution , size of the giant component , clustering coefficient and degree correlation . some of these results are used throughout this paper .",
    "newman s model , although realistic because of its overlapping communities , is strongly limited since links only arise through communities .",
    "a node belonging to a single clique does not participate at all in the coupling , while a node belonging to two cliques or more will have a huge influence .",
    "hence , it is hard to describe weakly coupled communities of significant sizes using this particular topology .",
    "consequently , we will introduce a more general description of community structure where exterior random links are also allowed .",
    "we simply add a distribution for the number of random links per individual , which is generated by : @xmath15 our networks will thus be defined by the @xmath2 probability and three distributions for the numbers of individuals per clique ( [ p0 ] ) , cliques per individual ( [ g0 ] ) and random links per individual ( [ k ] ) .",
    "intuition indicates that a large number of networks can be decomposed as basic structures coupled either by sharing nodes , by forced connections or a combination of both . in fact , many of the previously cited papers study networks where nodes belong to a single clique coupled only by random links with the outside world ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our general model includes this topology and newman s original model as special cases .",
    "the philosophy behind our formalism is to analyze the network simultaneously from two perspectives , i.e. the state of the network is followed from the point of view of recurrent patterns in its topology and of the elements themselves .",
    "more precisely , we compartmentalize both the structure and the node ensemble in terms of their relation to one another and couple the two systems to give a complete description of the propagation phenomenon . for social networks featuring community structure ,",
    "the recurrent patterns are cliques of individuals that can be distinguished by their size and their state .",
    "the elements are individuals distinguishable by the number of cliques to which they belong and by their number of exterior random links .",
    "that is , the mean state of a given class of individuals will act as if all of their cliques and random links were approximated by a mean - field and the mean state of a given class of cliques will act as if all individuals were also reduced to a mean - field approximation .",
    "the behaviors of both cliques and individuals are coupled in terms of their connections via the generating functions through .",
    "the particular case under study is a susceptible - infectious - susceptible ( sis ) model of disease propagation . in continuous time",
    ", an infectious node may pass the disease to any of its susceptible neighbors at a rate @xmath16 , while it is recovering from the disease at a rate @xmath17 .",
    "given initial conditions , we are interested in developping a system of equations capable of following the state @xmath18 of the network , where @xmath18 is the fraction of infectious individuals at a given time . according to our philosophy",
    ", we thus need to follow both individuals and cliques .",
    "let @xmath19 be the proportion of individuals which belong to @xmath0 cliques , have @xmath20 random links and are susceptible at time @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the proportion of cliques whose population is @xmath1 and of which @xmath23 are infectious at time @xmath21 . for the sake of clarity , we will not explicitly mark the time dependence , @xmath24 , when it is obvious that the quantity is a dynamical variable .",
    "first , we need to describe how the generating functions @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 will differ depending on the state of the involved individual . to define the dynamical generating functions , it is possible to either follow the distributions for the susceptibles or the infectious individuals , since @xmath28 .",
    "we will follow the susceptibles .",
    "we then need the distribution of cliques reached from a susceptible individual of a given clique .",
    "this distribution will be affected by @xmath29 in the following manner : a random individual has probability @xmath11 of belonging to @xmath30 other cliques , but consequently , only a probability @xmath31 of being susceptible at time @xmath21 .",
    "the reasoning is even simpler for @xmath26 as the distribution is not affected by the knowledge that the individual belongs to at least one clique .",
    "we can directly write : @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 where the tilde denotes that the function generates a distribution which applies to susceptible individuals only . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the knowledge that a clique is reached by a link emerging of a susceptible individual will affect the distribution of this clique s number of susceptible individuals .",
    "the probability that a susceptible individual belongs to a clique of state @xmath34 is directly proportional to the number of susceptible members of that particular state . in order to consider only susceptibles individuals",
    ", the @xmath35 generating function must be modified accordingly to the number of susceptible members belonging to each compartment : @xmath36 four interesting and important quantities can be derived from these dynamical generating functions .",
    "firstly , the average number of infectious neighbors per clique and per random link for a susceptible individual , @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath39 secondly , the mean number of excess infectious neighbors per clique and per random link for a susceptible individual of a given clique , @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 where the primes denote a derivative with respect to @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 is the average number of outside cliques for a susceptible member of a given clique at time @xmath21 .",
    "let us now construct the differential equation governing @xmath45 .",
    "we previously mentionned that the disease spreads through any link between a susceptible and an infectious individual . thus , with @xmath37 being the average number of such links that a susceptible may have in a single clique , the rate at which the class of individuals belonging to @xmath0 cliques is infected , is proportionnal to @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , with @xmath38 being the probability that a random link leads to an infectious individual , the rate of infection for individuals with @xmath20 random links must be proportionnal to @xmath47 .",
    "simultaneously , the same ratio increases as the infected nodes recover at a speed @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the set of equations governing the point of view of the individuals is simply obtained by summing the contributions from these three processes : @xmath49 \\;. \\label{s_ml}\\ ] ] similar considerations are needed to define the dynamics of the @xmath50 values .",
    "a clique in a @xmath51 state can either pass to @xmath52 by infection ( if @xmath53 ) or to @xmath54 by recovery ( if @xmath55 ) . the first process is proportionnal to the sum of the number of links between infectious and susceptible individuals within the cliques and the number of links with infectious neighbors that each susceptible might have outside the considered clique . for a given @xmath51 compartment , infection can either bring new cliques from the @xmath54 state or cause the cliques to pass to the more infectious @xmath52 compartment : @xmath56c_{n , i-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\tau \\left(n - i\\right)\\left[\\epsilon i+\\rho ( t)+ \\sigma ( t)\\right]c_{n , i } \\ ; . \\label{c_ni_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the contribution of the recovery process is easy to explicit using the same logic , as it is simply proportionnal to the number of infectious individuals who might recover : @xmath57 summing the contributions of both the infections ( [ c_ni_1 ] ) and the recoveries ( [ c_ni_2 ] ) yields the desired differential equation for the cliques dynamics : @xmath58c_{n , i-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\tau \\left(n - i\\right)\\left[\\epsilon i+\\rho ( t)+\\sigma ( t)\\right]c_{n , i } \\ ; .",
    "\\label{c_ni}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is defined only for @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "coupled with eq .",
    "( [ s_ml ] ) , we now have a complete dynamical system for the state of the network in a sis model of disease spread .",
    "if desired , the mean fraction of infectious individuals of a given class of cliques can be obtained in a straightforward manner with : @xmath60 it is generally simpler to caracterize the state of the network via the total fraction of infectious , @xmath18 , or susceptible , @xmath61 , individuals . from eq .",
    "( [ s_ml ] ) , we directly have : @xmath62 note that a straightforward evaluation of the global state of the network from @xmath63 would be biased because an individual belonging to @xmath0 cliques would be counted @xmath0 times more than an individual participating to a single clique",
    ".      system ( [ s_ml ] ) and ( [ c_ni ] ) can be solved as a traditional self - consistent field by looking for a solution in terms of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "equation ( [ c_sol ] ) can be used to fix the stable values of all the @xmath74 relative to @xmath75 , which can then be solved exactly by applying the following topological constraint : @xmath76 using the equilibrium condition on eq .",
    "( [ s_ml ] ) provides a direct solution for the @xmath77 ensemble : @xmath78 it is then possible to write @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 in terms of @xmath83 and @xmath84 by using ( [ c_sol ] ) in ( [ r ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) while using ( [ s_sol ] ) in ( [ g_1_mod ] ) and ( [ k_mod ] ) .",
    "a transcendental equation is obtained for @xmath85 by writing ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) as : @xmath86 r^ * \\nonumber \\\\ &   \\qquad\\qquad + \\left [ \\frac{\\sum _ { m , l } ls_{m , l}^*}{\\sum _ { m , l } s_{m , l}^ * } \\right ] t^ * \\equiv f(\\xi ^ * ) \\ ; , \\label{trans_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dependence on @xmath85 comes from that of @xmath87 on @xmath79 and @xmath80 written in terms of @xmath88 which are a direct function of @xmath85 . solving for @xmath85 yields a unique non - zero solution fixing @xmath89 which in turn provide the values for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this directly fixes @xmath87 using ( [ s_sol ] ) , and thus the stable state of the network defined by ( [ global_state ] ) .",
    "clearly the dynamics is governed by the ratio @xmath90 and not the individual rates . therefore , under the transformation to the normalized propagation rate @xmath91 , our model admits a single independent parameter in its dynamics .",
    "is shown in shade on the topology defined in ( [ topo ] ) for two different normalized propagations rates : @xmath92 in dotted line ( under the threshold ; no solution for @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 in solid line ( epidemic ) .",

    "equation ( [ trans_eq ] ) behaves as shown in fig .",
    "[ f ] with a trivial solution at @xmath97 and another possible solution @xmath93 depending on @xmath91 and the topology .",
    "since @xmath98 is a monotonously increasing function , @xmath99 can be found by the following condition : @xmath100 for initial derivative value above unity , a solution @xmath93 exists and the stable epidemic state is non - zero ( fig .",

    "subject to a propagation at its threshold , by definition , we know that the stable state is the trivial solution @xmath101 @xmath69 @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xmath69 @xmath104 ( which implies @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "it follows that the mean - field values are zero at equilibrium and ( [ tau_c_cond ] ) straightforwardly becomes : @xmath107 using ( [ c_sol ] ) to evaluate the derivative at equilibrium , one finds that @xmath108 : @xmath109 using ( [ thresh_sol ] ) to solve ( [ thresh_cond ] ) for @xmath99 provides a polynomial with positive coefficients for terms of order one or more : @xmath110 this polynomial therefore has a single real positive solution , which is the epidemic threshold of the network . for random networks , one can set @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 so that all links are shared within cliques of size two .",
    "expression ( [ thresh_poly ] ) then reduces to : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is here the mean excess degree . from eq .",
    "( [ tau_c_rg ] ) , one can deduce that our model predicts a null sis epidemic threshold only if @xmath115 diverges . for scale - free networks",
    "whose degree distribution falls as @xmath116 , it can be shown that @xmath115 diverges if @xmath117 .",
    "our model therefore leads to the same conclusion as @xcite : scale - free networks with degree distribution @xmath118 and @xmath117 are defined by an absence of epidemic threshold .",
    "a calculation of the sis epidemic threshold on random networks was previously done in @xcite , using discrete time steps and constant recovery period approximations . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "( [ thresh_poly ] ) is the first equation for a continous time sis model of epidemic spread for both random networks and community structure .",
    "in order to highlight the difference between rn and cs , both types of networks will be studied analytically and numerically .",
    "the cs network will be compared with its equivalent random network ( ern ) : a network with exactly the same degree distribution , but with randomly connected nodes ( zero degree correlation ) .",
    "note that on our general model of community structure , the pgf for the degree distribution is simply generated by @xcite : @xmath119 to describe an ern with this distribution , two simple options are available .",
    "firstly , one can set @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 so that all cliques are of size two ( i.e. regular links ) and then choose the @xmath7 distribution equal to the initial degree distribution ( [ degree_pgf ] ) of the cs network .",
    "secondly , one can set @xmath123 and @xmath124 with any @xmath125 so that all cliques are of size one ( i.e. simple nodes ) and then choose the @xmath126 distribution equal to the initial degree distribution ( [ degree_pgf ] ) .",
    "both will be used in what follows .",
    "the time evolution of the analytical system is obtained from an integration based on a 4th order runge - kutta algorithm with adaptive time steps .",

    "the final ensemble of links presents a topology as shown in fig .",
    "[ schema ] with a degree distribution generated by ( [ degree_pgf ] ) ; where nodes are highly clustered , but the clique concept itself is invisible .",
    "each and every network generated by this procedure is accepted and kept in the results , as they are part of the canonical ensemble considered by the mean - field approach of the formalism . for every generated network , a fraction @xmath127 of individuals are randomly chosen to be initially infectious and the dynamics is then simulated in a discrete time propagation simulation valid for a time step @xmath146 ( we choose @xmath147 such that @xmath148 and @xmath149 are lesser than @xmath150 ) :    1 .   at each @xmath147 , every susceptible neighbor of every infectious individual is infected with probability @xmath151 ; 2 .   at each @xmath147",
    "every infectious individual recovers with probability @xmath152 .",
    "finally , for each constructed network , the final degree distribution is used to generate an ern for comparison .",
    "the first topology chosen to test the formalism is the special model presented in @xcite , which does not allow random links and is thus obtained by setting @xmath153 ( i.e. all links are shared within a clique ) .",
    "we will then use @xmath154 , a power - law distribution for the numbers of cliques per individual and a poisson distribution for the numbers of individuals per clique : @xmath155 this topology results in a degree distribution generated by the following function : @xmath156 this heterogenous distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ dis_fig ] .",
    "to follow the propagation dynamics on an ern , we use the first of the two options previously presented : all cliques are of size two with @xmath157 and a distribution @xmath158 equivalent to ( [ dis ] ) .    our results on this topology , fig .",
    "[ results ] , confirm that our formalism is indeed capable of following the time evolution of the network in structured and random topologies .",
    "furthermore , both our numerical and analytical results support the conclusions of @xcite as will be discussed below .",
    "firstly , as evident in fig .",
    "[ stable ] , the community structure does not significantly change the stable state of the system .",
    "this conclusion is only valid when the giant components of cs and of the ern have approximately the same size and under condition that the network is well connected . in physical terms",
    ", this means that the coupling must be sufficiently high between the subsystems , relative to the strength of the interaction ( i.e. @xmath91 ) .",
    "if this condition is not fully met , subsets of the canonical distribution of configurations ( i.e. ones with higher number of independent cliques ) will have stable states under the predicted value and will decrease the mean value .",
    "the reduction of the giant component was already explained in @xcite .",
    "this effect is visible in both analytical and numerical results of fig .",
    "[ stable ] for lower infection rate and eventually leads to a higher epidemic threshold for networks with community structure .",
    "this particular property seems to contradict a major conclusion of @xcite , yet it is important to take into account that the conclusion that clustering lowers the epidemic threshold was made on networks featuring different degree distributions ( see @xcite for a complete discussion ) and featuring degree correlation ( see @xcite for an analysis of correlation and clustering effects ) .",
    "our results show that , given an _",
    "identical _ degree distribution and zero degree correlation , the random networks will have a lower epidemic threshold than a network featuring community structure .",
    "this conclusion is intuitive because links shared in community have a higher probability of being `` wasted '' ( i.e. of leading to another infectious node ) than a random link , independently of the transmissibility .",
    "the mechanism behind this phenomenon is simple : there is a higher probability that neighbors of a new infectious individual will also be infectious if these individuals are connected in groups .",
    "this leads to a lower mean epidemic size for low infection rate and to the observed higher epidemic threshold .",
    "note that , within the community structure effects observed here , the individual effects of clustering and degree correlation can not be separated .",
    "the demonstration given in appendix shows that , for networks with zero degree correlation , our model always predicts a higher epidemic threshold for networks with clustering than for equivalent random networks .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that correlation effects alone have been shown to lower the percolation threshold @xcite . as similar effects can take place on networks with community structure , our conclusion is not directly generalizable to networks with non - zero degree correlation .    secondly , as seen in fig .",
    "[ evo_tempo ] , the community structure increases the relaxation time of the system ; i.e. it slows the disease propagation towards the equilibrium .",
    "this phenomenon is also explained by the higher number of wasted links on a community structure than on the equivalent random network .",
    "these links are very frequent in social networks because of community structure where `` the friend of my friend is also my friend '' .",
    "when counting new possible infections on networks with exactly the same degree distribution , the number of second neighbors will be higher in a random network than on a community structure , because the neighbors of my neighbor may have already been counted as my neighbor in the cs network .",
    "this results in a slower propagation and a typically higher epidemic threshold .",
    "finally , note that the shift observed in the epidemic threshold is not always as small as seen on fig .",
    "[ stable ] .",
    "for example , a topology with @xmath159 and @xmath160 yields @xmath161 .",
    "this particular case was verified by mc simulations .      as a second test to our formalism ,",
    "we use @xmath162 and the following distributions : @xmath163 which result in the second degree distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ dis_fig ] and generated by : @xmath164 in this case , the ern are obtained by using cliques of size one and fitting the degree distribution with the random links generated by @xmath26 . the results obtained on this second topology",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ topo2_res ] .",
    "they not only confirm the quality of our treatment , but also earlier conclusions .",
    "the propagation slow - down is stronger in the time evolution featured in fig .",
    "[ evo2 ] than in the case observed in fig .",
    "[ evo_tempo ] , because the topology used produces a much higher proportion of intra - clique links for a given individual , and consequently , a higher fraction of wasted links .",
    "it is believed that this effect could be studied using percolation theory with a quantification of cs , such as the modularity concept introduced by newman and girvan in @xcite .",
    "what may well be the single most important contribution of this paper is the philosophy upon which the formalism is based .",
    "an effective dynamical description of complex networks can be obtained by a mean - field approach using a compartmentalisation of both the networks elements ( e.g. individuals or nodes ) and of their recurrent topological patterns ( e.g. cliques or substructures ) in classes of homogeneous state and behavior .",
    "it has been shown that a particular topology , the community structure , can be solved with this method .",
    "furthermore , the approach can also describe random topology in the limit of the most elementary patterns possible .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to assert that other complex topologies may be treated in a similar manner .",
    "more precisely , our analytical results confirm previous numerical simulations on the effects of community structure in propagation dynamics : in comparison to equivalent random networks , the structured systems feature longer relaxation times ( i.e. slower propagation ) and generally higher epidemic thresholds .    an especially interesting avenue to explore would be to direct the formalism towards more epidemiologically oriented applications with a generalization to other propagation model ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in an epidemic context , taking the topology of social network into account allows precise emulation of real intervention scenarios which are often based on groups of individuals ( e.g. school closings and vaccination of public health workers both correspond to interventions on given cliques ) .",
    "other applications of our formalism are possible in various models of dynamics and topologies",
    ". of particular interest is the application of our formalism to dynamical networks ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this may help in gaining insights on the emergence and the stability of social structure .",
    "the research team is grateful to cihr ( lhd , pan and aa ) , nserc ( vm and ljd ) and fqrnt ( ljd ) for financial support .",
    "this paper has shown that our model can describe propagation phenomena on network with community structure as well as network with random topology . using the analytic solution for the epidemic threshold on newman s topology , it is possible to show that , given two networks with identical degree distributions and zero degree correlation , but where one is completely random while the other features community structure ( and therefore clustering ) , the latter will have a higher epidemic threshold .",
    "first of all , degree correlation refers to situations where , given a random link in the network , the knowledge of the excess degree of one of its nodes influences the probability distribution for the excess degree of the other . for newman s model ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the probability @xmath165 that a given link joins two nodes of excess degree @xmath139 and @xmath166 can be calculated as follows .",
    "we first write : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the number of potential degrees in a clique of size @xmath1 , @xmath133 is a normalization factor corresponding to the total number of potential links in the network and @xmath169 is the probability that a link within a clique of size @xmath1 joins two nodes of excess degree @xmath139 and @xmath166 .",
    "this probability can be calculated by separating @xmath139 in @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively the excess links shared within and outside of the considered clique , and doing the same for @xmath166 .",
    "we can now write : @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the probabilities that the nodes have @xmath171 and @xmath175 links outside the clique of size @xmath1 .",
    "these two probabilities are simply generated by the pgfs composition @xmath176 .",
    "now , because both @xmath166 and @xmath139 must be calculated with one clique in common where they both have @xmath177 potential excess neighbors , we can write the set of @xmath178 in terms of the following pgf : @xmath179 where @xmath180^{-1}\\sum _",
    "n n(n-1)z^{n-2}$ ] . for a random network",
    ", it is easily obtained that @xmath165 is simply the product of the two independent probabilities of having nodes of excess degree @xmath139 and @xmath166 .",
    "thus , by differentiating the degree distribution pgf ( [ degree_pgf ] ) to obtain the excess degree distribution , we find : @xmath181 for expressions ( [ ejk_pgf_cs ] ) and ( [ ejk_pgf_rg ] ) to be equivalent , the following condition must be satisfied : @xmath182 we want to compare two networks sharing exactly the same degree distribution and degree correlation . equation ( [ p2_cond ] ) gives us the condition for which two networks with identical degree distributions , one featuring community structure and the other random topology , will have the same degree correlation .",
    "it is easy to conclude that the distribution of individuals per clique , in order to respect eq .",
    "( [ p2_cond ] ) , can only be given by : @xmath183 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary positive integer .",
    "in other words , all structures must be the same size .",
    "this limitation comes from the way we construct our random networks . because by simply matching degrees generated from a given distribution , the knowledge of one neighbor s degree does not give any information concerning the other neighbor s degree .",
    "note that @xmath184 and @xmath2 are totally free , so that the heterogeneity of the degree distribution is not entirely compromised .",
    "we will now compare two networks with zero degree correlations .",
    "the first is random with @xmath185 and @xmath122 while the other exhibits community structure with @xmath186 with @xmath187 and @xmath188 $ ] .",
    "the two networks have exactly the same degree distribution , which means that @xmath189 . using eq .",
    "( [ thresh_poly ] ) , we can easily write the epidemic threshold for the random network : @xmath190 } \\ ; , \\label{tau_c_ann}\\ ] ] where the last expression uses the pgfs of the structured network in which @xmath191 is the mean number of excess cliques per individual .",
    "we will now insert expression ( [ tau_c_ann ] ) in the epidemic threshold condition ( [ thresh_cond ] ) of the network with community structure . because all terms in the polynomial are positive",
    ", we expect to find an expression greater than unity if ( [ tau_c_ann ] ) is higher than the threshold for cs , equal to one if the threshold remains the same or lesser than unity if the threshold for the ern is actually lower than that for cs . to prove the latter case , for arbitrary @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath158 , we simply demonstrate the following inequality written from ( [ thresh_cond ] ) using ( [ tau_c_ann ] ) : @xmath192^{-i } < 1 \\ ; . \\label{ineq}\\ ] ] further , it can be shown that the derivative of ( [ ineq ] ) in @xmath193 is always positive .",
    "this provides us with an upper bound for ( [ ineq ] ) in the limit @xmath194 . using lhpital s rule",
