    "in ref.@xcite , maxwell proposed his famous gedanken experiment wherein a demon controls the flow of gas particles from one chamber to another and decides which particles to let through based on their temperature .",
    "he gave this thought experiment as an example of a thermodynamic process in which the second law of thermodynamics appears to be violated .",
    "he dismissed the paradox by saying that the second law is true only on average . in ref.@xcite , szilard proposed an engine which is a simplified version of a maxwell s demon .",
    "szilard argued that for his engine , the second law is not violated at all , as long as the work performed by the demon to make his measurements is taken into account . in refs.@xcite and @xcite , landauer and",
    "later bennett pointed out that measurements can be performed without spending any energy , but that in order for an engine to perform a cyclic process , it needs to store the information of the measurement on a tape and then erase and re - initialize that tape once per cycle .",
    "these tape operations will always consume an amount of energy larger or equal to the work the demon can extract from changes in gas volumes .",
    "maxwell s demon thought experiment might have once been considered paradoxical , but after the work of szilard , landauer and bennett , most scientists consider the paradox pretty much solved . nevertheless , some people , myself included , still strive to make the mathematics involved in the treatment of maxwell s demon a bit more streamlined .",
    "that is one of the goals of this paper , to look at maxwell s demon from a different point of view , hoping that this might yield new insights to an already understood problem .",
    "this paper originated as an attempt to understand a series of papers ( refs.@xcite to @xcite ) by sagawa , ueda and coworkers ( s - u ) in which they claim that the standard second law of thermodynamics does not apply to non - equilibrium processes with feedback ( i.e. , maxwell demon type processes ) .",
    "they give a generalization of the second law that they claim does apply to such processes .",
    "although i agree in spirit with much of what s - u are trying to do , and i profited immensely from reading their papers , i disagree with some of the details of their theory .",
    "i discuss my disagreements with the s - u theory in a separate paper , ref.@xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to report on my own theory for generalizing the second law so that is applies to processes with feedback .",
    "my theory agrees in spirit with the s - u theory , but differs from it in some important details .",
    "let me explain the rationale behind my theory",
    ".    suppose we want to consider a system in thermal contact but not necessarily in equilibrium with a bath at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 denote all non - thermal variables ( fast changing , not in thermal equilibrium ) and let @xmath2 denote all thermal variables ( slow changing , in thermal equilibrium ) describing both the system and bath .",
    "let @xmath3 denote time .",
    "for any operator @xmath4 , define @xmath5 .",
    "my slight generalization of the second law is    [ eq - cain ] , where @xmath6 is the conditional entropy ( i.e. , conditional spread ) of @xmath7 given @xmath8 .",
    "i call eq.([eq - cain ] ) the conditional ageing inequality ( cain ) .",
    "the standard second law corresponds to the special case when there are no @xmath9 variables , in which case eq.([eq - cain ] ) reduces to    s_(_)0 [ eq - sec - law ] .",
    "the standard second law could be described as unconditional ageing , or simply as ageing .",
    "now , what is the justification for the cain ?",
    "the justification for the second law eq.([eq - sec - law ] ) is that the superoperator that evolves the overall probability distribution in the classical case ( or the overall density matrix in the quantum case ) , from time 0 to @xmath3 , increases entropy because it can be shown to be doubly stochastic in the classical case ( or unital in the quantum case ) .",
    "the justification for the cain is the same , except that the evolution superoperator is doubly stochastic ( or unital ) only if the non - thermal variables are held fixed during the evolution .",
    "the cain is not true for all evolution superoperators .",
    "our hope is that it applies to systems of interest that commonly occur in nature .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the consequences of the cain .",
    "in particular , we apply the cain to four cases of the szilard engine : for a classical or a quantum system with either one or two correlated particles .",
    "besides proposing this new inequality that we call the cain , another novel feature of this paper is that we use quantum bayesian networks for our analysis of maxwell demon type processes .",
    "this paper is written assuming that the reader has first read refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
