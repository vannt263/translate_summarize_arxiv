    "interacting quantum many - body systems generally exhibit correlations between its constituents . at sufficiently low temperatures , near the ground - state ,",
    "these correlations possess quantum mechanical features , namely entanglement . compared to its classical counterpart ,",
    "entanglement is extremely complex .",
    "its full characterization generally requires the measurement of a number of observables that grows exponentially with the number of constituents of the quantum many - body systems . on the one hand",
    ", the ability to create entanglement merely by cooling an interacting quantum many - body system provides the attractive opportunity of using this entanglement to carry out quantum information processing tasks such as measurement based quantum computation @xcite or adiabatic quantum computation @xcite which gain their power exactly because of the complex structure of entanglement .",
    "however , the very same setting offers significant challenges , as it is much harder to analyze theoretically and , crucially , experimentally : while for the few - particle systems that can now be prepared in highly controlled environments such as ion traps , it is possible to fully characterize the state in the laboratory by quantum state tomography @xcite , the situation in condensed matter systems is far more challenging .",
    "firstly , the number of subsystems tends to be much larger , the level of control over states and hamiltonians is more restricted and crucially the available measurements for condensed matter systems are much less general : local measurements addressing individual constituents are usually not available and one has to rely on global measurements such as those obtained in scattering experiments to draw conclusions about the system .",
    "these are of course by no means sufficient to fully characterize the state in the laboratory",
    ". how might one still be able to say something about the entanglement that is available ?",
    "one approach could be to , e.g. , model the system with a certain quantum hamiltonian and compare it to a classical model .",
    "if the predictions from the quantum model matches the measurement results while the classical does not , and the simulated quantum state displays entanglement , one might conclude that the state in the laboratory is indeed entangled .",
    "this however is a fallacy .",
    "consider the following example of two spins @xcite : suppose one measures the correlation @xmath0 and obtains the result @xmath1 .",
    "this measurement is consistent with _ both _ the maximally entangled state @xmath2 _ and _ the separable state @xmath3 .",
    "hence , without further assumptions , one may not decide whether the state in the laboratory is entangled or not . a possible assumption",
    "may be that the system is in thermal equilibrium at some known temperature _ and _ that the hamiltonian that governs the system is known precisely . but",
    "obtaining knowledge about the hamiltonian experimentally is even harder than to obtain the state itself ! a technique to decide without a doubt wether entanglement",
    "is contained in a given system should hence not rely on knowing the hamiltonian , it should , in fact , not rely on any kind of knowledge about the system other than measured data , but be able to quantify entanglement by just relying on measured observables .    here we present a scheme to quantify entanglement in condensed matter systems that fulfils all the above requirements and relies only on measurements that are already available : neutron scattering from spin systems and time - of - flight imaging of cold atoms .",
    "hence , we show that it is possible to directly  without any assumptions ",
    "measure entanglement in many - body systems . to this end",
    "we exploit the substantial body of work concerning the characterization ( which states are entangled ) , quantification ( how much of it do we have ) and verification ( on the basis of simple measurements we need to answer the previous questions ) of entanglement ( see @xcite for a tutorial review and @xcite for a advanced and very comprehensive review ) that has been established in quantum information science . more precisely , we combine methods for determining the presence of entanglement in quantum many - body system @xcite with proposals for the quantitative verification of entanglement in few body quantum systems @xcite to achieve an experimentally accessible method for measuring entanglement .",
    "one of the standard tools to analyze condensed matter samples is neutron scattering , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "the deflected neutrons carry information about both the structural and magnetic properties of the sample , which can be read of the differential scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform of the magnetic cross section gives access to spin correlations in reciprocal space such as the positive hermitian observable @xmath4 , where @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are pauli spin matrices acting on lattice site @xmath9 located at @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the total number of spins , so the number of lattice sites .",
    "analogous observables can be obtained for spin systems realized in ion traps or cold atoms in optical lattices , in which one can directly measure spin correlations by light scattering @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will show how a measurement of observables of the type in eq .",
    "( [ spin_observe ] ) alone is sufficient to quantify the entanglement contained in the sample",
    ". we will consider systems comprised of spin @xmath12 particles ( generalizations to higher spins are entirely straightforward ) on a lattice and set out to derive a lower bound to the entanglement that is consistent with the measurement data .",
    "it will turn out that it is possible to find a lower bound that is a simple function of the static structure factor @xmath13 . hence , for this , no assumptions about the state are necessary , in particular , no knowledge about the hamiltonian is required .    in the following we present definitions and a derivation that will lead to the central result in eq .",
    "( [ spin_central_result ] ) , which provides a lower bound on the entanglement of any spin - state under investigation that can be used directly on experimental data .",
    "several entanglement measures may be expressed in the form @xcite @xmath14\\bigr\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the set of hermitian operators that fulfil @xmath16 for separable states ( i.e. , the set of _ entanglement witnesses _",

    "in fact , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , is an entanglement monotone for every @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "this works of course for _ any _ spin system and _ any _ observable .    in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the best separable approximation and the observable @xmath28 . consider the operator @xmath29 for which we now show that @xmath26 .",

    "<S> we show how entanglement may be quantified in spin and cold atom many - body systems using standard experimental techniques only . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme requires no assumptions on the state in the laboratory and a lower bound to the entanglement can be read off directly from the scattering cross section of neutrons deflected from solid state samples or the time - of - flight distribution of cold atoms in optical lattices , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this removes a major obstacle which so far has prevented the direct and quantitative experimental study of genuine quantum correlations in many - body systems : the need for a full characterization of the state to quantify the entanglement contained in it . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the scheme presented here relies solely on global measurements that are routinely performed and is versatile enough to accommodate systems and measurements different from the ones we exemplify in this work .    </S>",
