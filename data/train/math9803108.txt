    "using combinatorial dualities for reflexive polyhedra and gorenstein cones together with the theory of generalized gkz - hypergeometric functions , one can extend the calculation of the number @xmath2 of rational curves of degree @xmath3 on the generic quintic threefold in @xmath4 by candelas , de la ossa , green , and parkes @xcite to the case of calabi - yau complete intersections in toric varieties @xcite .",
