    "in soft matter physics , much attention has been paid to the consequences of the coulombic interaction among charged objects , such as small ions , charged colloids , charged gels , and polyelectrolytes @xcite .",
    "however , not enough effort has been made on solvation effects among solutes ( including hydrophobic particles ) and polar solvent molecules @xcite .",
    "solvation is also called hydration for water and for aqueous mixtures . in mixtures of a water - like fluid and a less polar",
    "fluid ( including polymer solutions ) , the solvation is preferential or selective , depending on whether the solute is hydrophilic or hydrophobic .",
    "see fig.1 for its illustration .",
    "the typical solvation free energy much exceeds the thermal energy @xmath1 per solute particle .",
    "hence selective solvation should strongly influence phase behavior or even induce a new phase transition . in experiments on aqueous mixtures",
    ", it is well known that a small amount of salt drastically alters phase behavior @xcite . in biology ,",
    "preferential interactions between water and cosolvents with proteins are of crutial importance @xcite .",
    "thus selective solvation is relevant in diverse fields , but its understanding from physics is still in its infancy .    around 1980 ,",
    "et al._@xcite proposed a possibility of mesophases in electrolytes from a coupling between the composition and the charge density in the free energy .",
    "in aqueous mixtures , such a coupling originates from the selective solvation@xcite .",
    "it is in many cases very strong , as suggested by data of the gibbs transfer free energy in electrochemistry ( see sec.2 ) .",
    "recently , several theoretical groups have proposed ginzburg - landau theories on the solvation in mixture solvents for electrolytes @xcite , polyelectrolytes@xcite , and ionic surfactants @xcite . in soft matter physics , such coarse - grained approaches have been used to understand cooperative effects on mesoscopic scales @xcite , though they are inaccurate on the angstrom scale .",
    "they are even more usuful when selective solvation comes into play in the strong coupling limit .",
    "this review presents such examples found in our recent research .",
    "* 1.1 antagonistic salt*. an antagonistic salt consists of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions .",
    "an example is sodium tetraphenylborate nabph@xmath2 , which dissociates into hydrophilic na@xmath3 and hydrophobic bph@xmath4 .",
    "the latter ion consists of four phenyl rings bonded to an ionized boron .",
    "such ion pairs in aqueous mixtures behave antagonistically in the presence of composition heterogeneity .",
    "( i ) around a water - oil interface , they undergo microphase separation on the scale of the debye screening length @xmath5 , while homogeneity holds far from the interface to satisfy the charge neutrality ( see the right bottom plate in fig.2 ) .",
    "this unique ion distribution produces a large electric double layer and a large galvani potential difference @xcite .",
    "we found that this ion distribution serves to much decrease the surface tension @xcite , in agreement with experiments @xcite . from x - ray reflectivity measurements ,",
    "@xcite determined such ion distributions around a water - nitrobenzene(nb ) interface by adding bph@xmath4 and two species of hydrophilic ions .",
    "( ii ) in the vicinity of the solvent criticality , antagonistic ion pairs interact differently with water - rich and oil - rich composition fluctuations , leading to mesophases ( charge density waves ) . in accord with this prediction ,",
    "sadakane _ et al . _",
    "@xcite added a small amount of nabph@xmath2 to a near - critical mixture of d@xmath6o and 3-methylpyridine ( 3mp ) to find a peak at an intermediate wave number @xmath7(@xmath8@xmath9 ) in the intensity of small - angle neutron scattering .",
    "the peak height was much enhanced with formation of periodic structures .",
    "( iii ) moreover , sadakane _ et al .",
    "_ observed multi - lamellar ( onion ) structures at small volume fractions of 3mp ( in d@xmath6o - rich solvent ) far from the criticality @xcite , where bph@xmath4 and solvating 3mp form charged lamellae .",
    "these findings demonstrate very strong hydrophobicity of bph@xmath4 .",
    "( iv ) another interesting phenomenon is spontaneous emulsification ( formation of small water droplets ) at a water - nb interface @xcite .",
    "it was observed when a large pure water droplet was pushed into a cell containing nb and antagonistic salt ( tetraalkylammonium chloride ) .",
    "this instability was caused by ion transport through the interface .",
    "* 1.2 precipitation due to selective solvation*. many experimental groups have detected large - scale , long - lived heterogeneities ( aggregates or domains ) emerging with addition of a hydrophilic salt or a hydrophobic solute in one - phase states of aqueous mixtures@xcite .",
    "their small diffusion constants indicate that their typical size is of order @xmath10 at very small volume fractions . in two - phase states",
    ", they also observed a third phase visible as a thin solid - like plate at a liquid - liquid interface in two - phase states @xcite .",
    "in our recent theory @xcite , for sufficiently strong solvation preference , a selective solute can induce formation of domains rich in the selected component even very far from the solvent coexistence curve .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when the volume fraction of the selected component is relatively small .",
    "if it is a majority component , its aggregation is not needed .",
    "this precipitation phenomenon should be widely observable for various combinations of solutes and mixture solvents .",
    "* 1.3 selective hydrogen bonding*. hydrogen bonding is of primary importance in the phase behavior of soft matter . in particular , using statistical - mechanical theories , the origin of closed - loop coexistence curves was ascribed to the hydrogen bonding for liquid mixtures @xcite and for polymer solutions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , water itself can be a selective solute triggering phase separation when the hydrogen bonding differs significantly between the two components , as observed in a mixture of methanol - cyclohexane @xcite .",
    "more drastically , even water absorbed from air changed the phase behavior in films of polystyrene(ps)- polyvinylmethylether(pvme ) @xcite .",
    "that is , a small amount of water induces precipitation of pvme - rich domains . for block copolymers , similar precipitation of micelles",
    "can well be expected when a small amount of water is added .    *",
    "1.4 ionic surfactant*. surfactant molecules are strongly trapped at an interface due to the amphiphilic interaction even if their bulk density is very low @xcite .",
    "they can thus efficiently reduce the surface tension , giving rise to various mesoscopic structures .",
    "however , most theoretical studies have treated nonionic surfactants , while ionic surfactants are important in biology and technology . in this review",
    ", we also discuss selective solvation in systems of ionic surfactants , counterions , and added ions in water - oil@xcite .",
    "we shall see that the adsorption behavior strongly depends on the selective solvation .    *",
    "1.5 polyelectrolytes*. polyelectrolytes are already very complex because of the electrostatic interaction among charged particles ( ionized monomers and mobile ions ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we should take into account two ingredients@xcite , which have not yet attracted enough attention .",
    "first , the dissociation ( or ionization ) on the chains should be treated as a chemical reaction in many polyelectrolytes containing weak acidic monomers @xcite .",
    "then the degree of ionization is a space - dependent annealed variable .",
    "second , the solvation effects should come into play because the solvent molecules and the charged particles interact via ion - dipole interaction .",
    "many polymers themselves are hydrophobic and become hydrophilic with progress of ionization in water .",
    "this is because the decrease of the free energy upon ionization is very large .",
    "it is also worth noting that the selective solvation effect can be dramatic in mixture solvents@xcite . as an example ,",
    "precipitation of dna has been observed with addition of ethanol in water @xcite , where the ethanol added is excluded from condensed dna , suggesting solvation - induced wetting of dna by water . in polyelectrolyte solutions , macroscopic phase separation and mesophase formation can both take place , sensitively depending on many parameters .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we will present the background of the solvation on the basis of some experiments . in sec.3",
    ", we will explain a ginzburg - landau model for electrolytes accounting for selective solvation .",
    "in sec.4 , we will treat ionic surfactants by introducing the amphiphilic interaction together with the solvation interaction . in sec.5",
    ", we will examine precipitation induced by a strong selective solute , where a simulation of the precipitation dynamics will also be presented .",
    "in sec.6 , we will give a ginzburg - landau model for weakly ionized polyelectrolytes accounting for the ionization fluctuations and the solvation interaction .",
    "in appendix a , we will give a statistical theory of hydrophilic solvation at small water contents in oil .",
    "* 2.1 hydrophilic ions in aqueous mixtures*. several water molecules form a solvation shell surrounding a small ion via ion - dipole interaction @xcite , as in fig.1 .",
    "cluster structures produced by solvation have been observed by mass spectrometric analysis @xcite .",
    "here we mention an experiment by osakai _",
    "et al _ @xcite , which demonstrated the presence of a solvation shell in a water - nb mixture in two - phase coexistence .",
    "they measured the amount of water extracted together with hydrophilic ions in a nb - rich region coexisting with a salted water - rich region .",
    "a water content of @xmath11 m ( the water volume fraction @xmath12 being 0.003 ) was already present in the nb - rich phase without ions .",
    "they estimated the average number of solvating water molecules in the nb - rich phase to be 4 for na@xmath3 , 6 for li@xmath3 , and 15 for ca@xmath13 per ion .",
    "thus , when a hydrophilic ion moves from a water - rich region to an oil - rich region across an interface , a considerable fraction of water molecules solvating it remain attached to it .",
    "furthermore , using proton nmr spectroscopy , osakai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied successive formation of complex structures of anions x@xmath14 ( such as cl@xmath14 and br@xmath14 ) and water molecules by gradually increasing the water content in nb .",
    "this hydration reaction is schematically written as x@xmath14(h@xmath6o)@xmath15 + h@xmath6o @xmath16 x@xmath14(h@xmath6o)@xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "for br@xmath14 , these clusters are appreciable for water content larger than @xmath19 m or for water volume fraction @xmath12 exceeding @xmath20 .    in appendix",
    "a , we will calculate the statistical distribution of clusters composed of ions and polar molecules .",
    "let the free energy typically decrease by @xmath21 upon binding of a polar molecule to a hydrophilic ion of species @xmath22 .",
    "a well - defined solvation shell is formed for @xmath23 , where the water volume fraction @xmath12 needs to satisfy > _",
    "sol^i ~(-_bi / k_bt ) . for @xmath24",
    "there is almost no solvation .",
    "the crossover volume fraction @xmath25 is very small for strongly hydrophilic ions with @xmath26 . for br@xmath14 in water - nb",
    ", we estimate @xmath27 from the experiment by osakai _",
    "_ as discussed above@xcite .",
    "* 2.2 hydrophobic particles*. hydrophobic objects are ubiquitous in nature , which repel water because of the strong attraction among hydrogen - bonded water molecules themselves @xcite .",
    "hydrophobic particles tend to form aggregates in water @xcite and are more soluble in oil than in water",
    ". they can be either neutral or charged .",
    "a widely used hydrophobic anion is bph@xmath4 . in water , a large hydrophobic particle @xmath28 nm )",
    "is even in a cavity separating the particle surface from water @xcite . in a water - oil mixture ,",
    "on the other hand , hydrophobic particles should be in contact with oil molecules instead .",
    "this attraction can produce significant composition heterogeneities on mesoscopic scales around hydrophobic objects , which indeed takes place around protein surfaces @xcite .",
    "* 2.3 solvation chemical potential*. we introduce a solvation chemical potential @xmath29 in the dilute limit of solute species @xmath22 .",
    "it is the solvation part of the chemical potential of one particle ( see eq.(b1 ) in appendix b ) .",
    "it is a statistical average over the thermal fluctuations of the molecular configurations . in mixture solvents",
    ", it depends on the ambient water volume fraction @xmath12 . for planar surfaces or large particles ( such as proteins )",
    ", we may consider the solvation free energy per unit area .",
    "born @xcite calculated the polarization energy of a polar fluid around a hydrophilic ion with charge @xmath30 using continuum electrostatics to obtain the classic formula , ( _ sol^i)_born = -(z_i^2e^2/2r_i ) ( 1 - 1/ ) . the contribution without polarization ( @xmath31 ) or in vacuum",
    "is subtracted and the @xmath12 dependence here arises from that of the dielectric constant @xmath32 ( see eq.(3.5 ) below ) . the lower cutoff @xmath33 is called the born radius , which is on the order of @xmath34 for small metallic ions @xcite . the hydrophilic solvation is stronger for smaller ions , since it arises from the ion - dipole interaction . in this original formula ,",
    "neglected are the formation of a solvation shell , the density and composition changes ( electrostriction ) , and the nonlinear dielectric effect .    for mixture solvents ,",
    "the binding free energy between a hydrophilic ion and a polar molecule is estimated from the born formula ( 2.1 ) as @xmath35/\\p\\phi$ ] or @xcite _ bi ~z_i^2e^2_1/r_i^2 = k_bt z_i^2_b_1/r_i , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the bjerrum length ( @xmath38 for water at room temperatures ) . for @xmath39 ,",
    "a well - defined shell appears for @xmath40 .",
    "the solvation chemical potential @xmath29 of hydrophilic ions in water - oil should largely decrease to negative values in the narrow range @xmath41 , as will be described in appendix a. in the wide composition range ( 2.1 ) , its composition dependence is still very strong such that @xmath42 holds ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "the solubility of hydrophilic ions should also increase abruptly in the narrow range @xmath43 with addition of water to oil .",
    "therefore , solubility measurements of hydrophilic ions would be informative at very small water contents in oil .    in sharp contrast , @xmath44 of a neutral hydrophobic particle increases with increasing the particle radius @xmath45 in water @xcite .",
    "it is roughly proportional to the surface area @xmath46 for @xmath47 nm and is estimated to be about @xmath48 at @xmath49 nm . in water - oil solvents , on the other hand , it is not easy to estimate the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath44 .",
    "however , @xmath44 should strongly increase with increasing the water composition @xmath12 , since hydrophobic particles ( including ions ) effectively attract oil molecules@xcite .",
    "* 2.4 gibbs transfer free energy*. we consider a liquid - liquid interface between a polar ( water - rich ) phase @xmath50 and a less polar ( oil - rich ) phase @xmath51 with bulk compositions @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the solvation chemical potential @xmath29 takes different values in the two phases due to its composition dependence .",

    "the difference of the solvation free energies between two coexisting phases is called the standard gibbs transfer free energy denoted by @xmath55 for each ion species @xmath22 .",

    "they then yield the ratio @xmath63 . in the case of water - nb , it is @xmath64 for na@xmath3 , @xmath65 for ca@xmath13 , and @xmath66 for br@xmath14 as examples of hydrophilic ions , while it is @xmath67 for hydrophobic bph@xmath68 . in the case of water - edc , it is @xmath69 for na@xmath3 and @xmath70 for br@xmath14 , while it is @xmath71 for bph@xmath68 .",

    "<S> we review our recent studies on selective solvation effects in phase separation in polar binary mixtures with a small amount of solutes . </S>",
    "<S> such hydrophilic or hydrophobic particles are preferentially attracted to one of the solvent components . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the role of antagonistic salt composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions , which undergo microphase separation at water - oil interfaces leading to mesophases . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss phase separation induced by a strong selective solvent above a critical solute density @xmath0 , which occurs far from the solvent coexistence curve . </S>",
    "<S> we also give theories of ionic surfactant systems and weakly ionized polyelectrolytes including solvation among charged particles and polar molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the gibbs formula for the surface tension needs to include an electrostatic contribution in the presence of an electric double layer . </S>"
