    "the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) form factors ( ffs ) provide a new aspect on the structure of the nucleon , since they contain essential information on how the constituents of the nucleon behave inside a nucleon .",
    "the emtffs have drawn considerable attention only very recently , even though they were first proposed by pagels several decades ago  @xcite .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that the natural probe to access the emtffs is the graviton , which is by no means a tractable tool to measure them experimentally .",
    "in the meantime the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) paved the way for novel understanding of the inner structure of the nucleon  .",
    "the emtffs are given by mellin moments of certain gpds and characterize how mass , spin and internal forces are distributed inside a nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the emtffs are as fundamental as for instance the electromagnetic form factors but provide different insights .",
    "the emtffs of the nucleon parametrize the nucleon matrix elements of the symmetric emt operator as follows  @xcite :    @xmath3u(p,\\ ,   s)\\ , , \\label{eq : emtff } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the mass and the spinor of the nucleon , respectively . the form factor @xmath9",
    "is related to the distribution of the energy density inside the nucleon .",
    "the quark and gluon contributions to this form factor at zero - momentum transfer are known from studies of deep - inelastic scattering and tell us that about a half of the momentum of a fast moving nucleon is carried by quarks , and the other half by gluons .",
    "the form factor @xmath10 is related to the total angular momentum of quarks and gluons , and is not known experimentally .",
    "it is equally important to understand the form factor @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emtff ] ) , since it describes how the strong forces are distributed and stabilized in the nucleon  @xcite . in all theoretical studies",
    "so far the value of this form factor at zero - momentum transfer , @xmath12 , was found to have a negative sign , and it was argued that this fact is deeply rooted in the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "information on emtffs can be obtained from studies of hard exclusive reactions , and in particular on @xmath13 from the beam charge asymmetry in deeply virtual compton scattering .",
    "the emtffs of the free nucleon were studied in the bag model @xcite and in soliton models in refs .",
    "@xcite , and most recently in the framework of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 solitonic model  @xcite .",
    "this model highlighted the role of @xmath1- and @xmath2-mesons in describing the nucleon structure .",
    "as known from the one - boson exchange potential for the nucleon - nucleon interaction , the vector mesons provide short - range repulsive forces , while the pion degrees of freedom furnish long - range attractive ones  @xcite .",
    "the emtff @xmath13 accommodates the ideal ground to study the interplay of the attractive and repulsive forces , which must exactly balance each other to comply with stability requirements .",
    "the characteristics of the vector mesons in the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 solitonic model turned out to be very similar to the one - boson exchange potential : the pion provides attraction at large distances , which is exactly balanced by repulsion at short distances due to vector mesons .",
    "the nucleon is known to undergo changes in nuclear medium due to its environment .",
    "the emtffs feature essential information on how the nucleon is modified in medium .",
    "thus , it is very important to examine the medium modification of the emtffs of the nucleon .",
    "these form factors have been studied so far only in the framework of the medium - modified skyrme - model  @xcite . in this context , it is of great importance to extend the recent investigation in the chiral solitonic model with explicit @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesonic degrees of freedom  @xcite to nuclear matter based on a medium - modified @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 soliton model  @xcite and to study how the structure of the nucleon undergoes changes due to the surrounding nuclear environment .",
    "the emtffs will directly reveal how the changes of the @xmath0 , the @xmath1 , and the @xmath2 in medium will affect the properties of the nucleon .",
    "this is our main purpose in the present work .",
    "moreover , the studies of nuclear medium effects may shed light on the emtffs of nuclei for which conflicting theoretical predictions exist  @xcite .",
    "the first measurements of deeply virtual compton scattering on nuclei by hermes @xcite did not reach the level of accuracy required to resolve nuclear effects .",
    "but future experiments at jefferson lab may provide new insights into the way how the nucleon is modified in medium .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly explain the formalism of the medium - modified @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 soliton model . in section iii , we derive the expressions for the emtffs within the present framework . in section iv , we discuss the results of the emtffs . in the final section",

    "however , the shear forces offer a new perspective and therefore equally instructive insights on the internal structure . in order to discuss what we learn from @xmath104 ,",
    "let us review the liquid drop analogy . in a liquid drop @xmath104",
    "would be given by a delta - function concentrated around the edge of the drop , and the coefficient of the delta - function would be the surface tension .",
    "the liquid drop model was explored in @xcite to compute the @xmath145-terms of nuclei .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows that the nucleon is much more diffuse than nuclei : the `` delta - function '' is strongly smeared out .",
    "nevertheless , the maximum of the shear - force density indicates the `` edge of the nucleon '' @xcite .",
    "the effect of the nuclear medium is to shift the peak of @xmath104 towards larger @xmath130 and broaden the shear force distribution .",
    "so the nucleon swells and becomes even more diffuse in nuclear medium , which confirms independently what we observed from other densities .",
    "notice that the peak of @xmath104 is larger in model ii than in model i , as the higher `` surface tension '' has to oppose stronger inner forces in model ii .",
    "this reflects independently the stronger response of the nucleon to the stiffer nuclear environment in model ii .        in order to examine the modification of the nucleon in detail ,",
    "it is instructive to consider the contribution of each meson to the pressure density . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot each contribution of the pure pionic part @xmath137 , the pure vector meson part @xmath146 and the interaction part @xmath147 to the pressure density , which discloses the most prominent feature of the pressure density . as in free space",
    ", the pion furnishes a strong attraction with the long - range asymptotics , which reflects the fact that the soliton can never be stabilized by the pion only .",
    "both the vector mesons come into play to make the soliton stable . on the other hand ,",
    "the skyrme quartic term stabilizes the soliton in the skyrme model .",
    "thus , in the present model , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons do play the same role as the skyrme quartic term  @xcite .",
    "the present results for the pressure distribution illustrate this well - known fact .",
    "the roles of the pion and the vector mesons were already discussed in free space  @xcite . compared with the results in free space ( indicated by the thin lines in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , in the nuclear medium the effect of the pion turns out to be noticeably suppressed , while the vector meson kinematic contribution is amplified , and the part due to the interaction term in turn is significantly suppressed .",
    "all contributions suffer a shift towards larger @xmath130 , which illustrates the microscopic dynamics responsible for the swelling of the nucleon size in medium .",
    "it is instructive to examine how the interaction part @xmath148 is modified in nuclear medium .",
    "the contribution of @xmath148 in nuclear matter is reduced and turns even negative before @xmath130 reaches @xmath149 , see fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "this change is less pronounced in model  ii than in model  i , which reflects the fact that the @xmath2 meson mass is not modified in nuclear medium in model  ii .",
    "therefore in model ii the core part of the in - medium nucleon is less modified compared to the free space case , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "another consequence of keeping the omega parameters at their values in free space , is that the positive part of the pressure density from @xmath150 turns out to be larger in model  ii than in model  i. this implies relatively larger repelling forces in the inner region , and causes a larger swelling of the nucleon in model  ii as compared to model  i. ( compare the changes of all mean - squared radii in model  i with those in model  ii as listed in table  [ tab:2 ] . )     as a function of @xmath151 .",

    "this reflects that the corresponding mean - squared radii in nuclear matter become larger , as we have shown already in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the last form factor , which is called the @xmath145-term form factor , is distinguished from the other two form factors .",
    "it is not constrained by any condition .",
    "however , the negative sign of @xmath157 at @xmath158 , which is called the @xmath145 term , arises as a consequence of stability .",
    "the @xmath145 term is defined in terms of the pressure density @xmath159 recall that the analog integral over @xmath160 vanishes due to the stability condition ( [ eq:39 ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath161 must have a negative value , because @xmath162 in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : d1 ] ) lessens the contribution from the inner ( positive ) part of the pressure density but amplifies that from the outer ( negative ) part .",
    "the explicit value of @xmath157 and its change in nuclear matter are given in tables  [ tab:1 ] and  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath161 in nuclear matter is larger than that in free space .",
    "this can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] in which the pressure density in nuclear matter was shown to be shifted to the outer region and became more strongly negative as @xmath130 increases .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ d1 ] , the @xmath161 form factor in nuclear matter falls off more rapidly than that in free space , as the other two form factors do .",
    "we note that the comparison of the results from models i and ii explicitly shows that @xmath161 form factor is very sensitive to the stabilization mechanism , i.e. to the interplay between the internal and external forces which stabilize the soliton .",
    "this is seen from table  [ tab:2 ] , where the change of @xmath163 in model ii is much larger than in model  i.    finally , we discuss the mean - squared radius of the emt trace operator @xcite .",
    "the form factor of the emt trace operator can be expressed in terms of the other emtffs , so that the mean - squared radius @xmath118 ( in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be given as @xmath164 the importance of this quantity lies in the fact that in qcd in the chiral limit the trace anomaly @xcite relates it to the mean - squared radius of the gluonic operator @xmath165 . although explicit gluonic degrees of freedom are absent , chiral soliton models allow one to evaluate consistently the trace of the emt , and thus to obtain in this way insights on this quantity  @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we see that in model i and model ii @xmath166 in free space .",
    "a similar value was obtained in the skyrme model of ref .",
    "@xcite ( though it was not explicitly reported there ) . in the chiral quark - soliton model  @xcite and a different skyrme model study  @xcite ,",
    "comparable values were obtained for @xmath118 .",
    "it is an important observation that the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model confirms the results from other solitonic approaches concerning the magnitude of @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the large value of the @xmath118 appears to be a robust prediction of chiral soliton models .",
    "their prediction for the mean - squared radius of the trace of the emt operator is remarkable @xcite , especially if one confronts it with the qcd sum rule study in which the mean - squared radius of the _ traceless _ part of the gluonic contribution to the emt was predicted to be one - order - of - magnitude smaller @xcite .    in our context , it is also interesting to explore the effects of the nuclear environment on the trace of the emt operator .",
    "table [ tab:2 ] shows that nuclear medium effects increase the mean - squared radius of the emt trace operator by 3040@xmath167 in model i and ii in the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-soliton framework , and similarly in the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "this is rather remarkable . at this point one",
    "has to be cautious , because one should take the chiral limit in order to isolate a gluonic contribution to the emt trace operator .",
    "this will be an interesting task for future studies .",
    "here we content ourselves to remark that , by exploring the trace anomaly , studies of the emt provide a unique opportunity to learn about nuclear medium effects on certain gluonic quantities .",
    "the present work aimed at investigating the energy - momentum tensor form factors in nuclear matter within the framework of the medium - modified @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 soliton model .",
    "the parameters in the model have been fixed by using the experimental data .",
    "the medium functionals , which are introduced to describe the influence of a nuclear environment on the properties of the single soliton , have been fixed by using the analysis of pionic atoms and the data on low - energy pion - nucleus scattering .",
    "we set up two different models , model i and model ii , by making different assumptions on the ksrf relation .",
    "both provided comparably satisfactory descriptions of medium effects , where model ii describes a stiffer nuclear medium .",
    "we computed the densities associated with the energy momentum tensor , and found that they all exhibited qualitatively similar patterns in nuclear medium : they are diminished in the inner region of the nucleon and broadened towards larger distances .",
    "this nicely illustrates the well - known facts that the nucleon swells and its mass is reduced in nuclear matter .",
    "in particular , the discussion of the pressure distribution has shown in great detail how the nucleon is stabilized in nuclear medium by the interplay of the different degrees of freedom within the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 soliton model .",
    "while the description of the energy - momentum tensor densities is qualitatively similar in model  i and model  ii , we made the interesting observation that a stiffer nuclear medium causes the nucleon to experience stronger internal forces .",
    "we also derived the three energy - momentum tensor form factors @xmath168 , @xmath10 , @xmath13 , and showed that they fall off faster than those in free space , which reflects that in general the mean - squared radii become larger in nuclear medium .    in all theoretical studies so far , the @xmath145-term @xmath12 was found to be negative , for the nucleon @xcite , the pion  @xcite , nuclei  @xcite , photons  @xcite , and @xmath169-balls  @xcite .",
    "the negative sign of the @xmath145-term was confirmed also for a nucleon bound in nuclear medium in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present work .",
    "medium effects do not change the generic pattern how internal forces balance to form a stable nucleon .",
    "however , they alter the strengths and ranges of the various contributions from the @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-meson degrees of freedom . the @xmath145-term is the quantity most sensitive to modifications in the interplay of attractive and repulsive internal forces inside the nucleon .",
    "the results obtained in this work and in the medium - modified skyrme model  @xcite will shed light on nuclear medium effects on the energy - momentum tensor form factors .",
    "to summarize , the study of the energy - momentum tensor form factors reveals directly the internal structure of the nucleon in both free space and in nuclear matter , of which the latter was in the focus of the present work .",
    "it is of great importance to investigate the nucleon inside the isospin asymmetric matter  @xcite , in neutron stars as well as inside real nuclei , where surface effects become essential .",
