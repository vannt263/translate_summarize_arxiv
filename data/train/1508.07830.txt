    "the afterglow radiation of gamma - ray bursts , which spans the range from the radio domain to the x - ray and possible higher frequencies , with a characteristic decrease in time of the peak flux , is nicely interpreted in terms of the synchrotron radiation of ultra - relativistic electron that have been accelerated at the forward ultra - relativistic collisionless shock wave of the outflow , see e.g. piran ( 2004 ) for a detailed review .",
    "this model thus opens a beautiful connection between astronomical data and the microphysics of the rather extreme phenomena that relativistic collisionless shocks represent .",
    "zooming in on microphysical scales reveals the shock front as a micro - turbulent magnetic barrier which isotropizes the incoming background plasma , see e.g. moiseev & sagdeev ( 1963 ) for pioneering studies and kato & takabe ( 2008 ) , spitkovsky ( 2008a ) for detailed numerical simulations .",
    "this micro - turbulent barrier itself results from the build - up of electromagnetic micro - instabilities ahead of the shock front , in the shock precursor where supra - thermal particles mix with the incoming background plasma , e.g. medvedev & loeb ( 1999 ) , wiersma & achterberg ( 2004 ) , lyubarksy & eichler ( 2006 ) , achterberg & wiersma ( 2007 ) , achterberg et al .",

    "@xmath10 , thus emerges as a key ingredient for the microphysics of collisionless shocks .",
    "actually , it also represents a key requisite for the relativistic fermi process , since this latter can take place ( in ideal conditions ) only when an intense micro - turbulence , with power on scales smaller than the gyroradius of the accelerated particles , is able to unlock the particles off the background magnetic field lines , by scattering them faster than a gyration time in this background field ( lemoine et al .",

    "2014a ) , a condition which is indeed satisfied for the forward shock of gamma - ray bursts , since @xmath14 in the interstellar medium .",

    "finally , these micro - instabilities may also build the magnetized turbulence in which the electrons eventually produce the afterglow radiation in a synchrotron - like process ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) ",
    "jitter effects are expected to be weak in the conditions typical of those shock waves  provided it survives collisonless damping downstream of the shock front ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 ) .",
    "recent analyses of the damping of this weibel - type micro - turbulence yield a damping rate @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes a turbulent wavenumber , indicating that small scales are dissipated first , but that large scales may survive longer ( chang et al .",
    "2008 , lemoine 2015 ) . in turn",
    ", this implies that the turbulence strength , or @xmath17 , should decay as a power - law in ( proper ) time ( or distance ) downstream of the shock front , with an index which itself depends on the ( unknown ) micro - turbulent power spectrum at the shock front .",
    "interestingly , this time dependence of @xmath17 turns out to be encoded in the multiwavelength synchrotron spectrum , since electrons of different lorentz factors cool at different times , hence in regions of different magnetic field strengths ( rossi & rees 2003 , derishev 2007 , lemoine 2013 ) .    although one can not exclude that other external instabilities would pollute the blast with magnetized turbulence , it is tempting to consider that the generation of micro - turbulence could be responsible at the same time for the formation of the shock , for the acceleration of particles and for the radiation of these particles",
    ". it is furthermore tempting to follow this thread to use the multiwavelength spectrum of gamma - ray bursts as a tomograph of the magnetized turbulence . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the recent detections of extended emission of gamma - ray bursts in the @xmath18mev band by the fermi - lat instrument do point to a net decay of the micro - turbulence behind the shock front ( lemoine et al .",
    "2013 ) , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this argument can be recapped as follows : if the accelerated particles scatter in a micro - turbulence , the maximal synchrotron photon energy is limited to a few gev at an observer time of @xmath21s ( kirk & reville 2010 , plotnikov et al .",
    "2013 , wang et al . 2013 , sironi et al .",
    "2013 ) ; this maximal energy scales as the square root of @xmath22 , i.e. the magnitude of the turbulence in the vicinity of the shock front , and the above value assumes @xmath23 ; therefore , the interpretation of this extended @xmath18mev emission as a synchrotron process points to the existence of a strong micro - turbulence close to the shock front ; on the other hand , multiwavelength fits of the afterglows for these fermi - lat gamma - ray bursts indicate that low - energy photons are produced in regions of rather low @xmath24 , of the order of @xmath25 ; this discrepancy between @xmath24 and @xmath22 is naturally interpreted as the decay of the micro - turbulence through collisionless damping .",
    "as discussed in lemoine et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the decay rate @xmath26 further matches the results of a detailed numerical experiment reported in keshet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the decay of micro - turbulence has also been proposed as a possible solution to the abnormal spectral indices observed in the prompt emission phase ( derishev 2007 ) , but admittedly , the physics of mildly relativistic shock waves may well differ from that of ultra - relativistic shock waves ; in particular , the extended precursor size in mildly relativistic shocks opens the way to other instabilities operating on larger length scales .",
    "although the present considerations can also be generalized to the case of internal shocks , all of the discussion that follows will focus on the external ultra - relativistic shock front .    an interesting consequence of a decaying micro - turbulence , or more generally , of a low average value of @xmath27 as measured in the fermi - lat and other bursts ( e.g. kumar & barniol - duran 2009 , 2010 , he et al .",
    "2011 , santana et al .",
    "2014 , barniol - duran 2014 ) , is a large compton parameter @xmath1 , at least if one omits the influence of klein - nishina effects , which actually depend on electron energy hence on observed frequency , see below .",
    "recall indeed that in the standard model , assuming that electrons cool through inverse compton interactions on their synchrotron spectrum in the thomson limit ( i.e. neglecting klein - nishina  kn  effects ) , @xmath28 at @xmath29 , with @xmath30 $ ] the cooling efficiency of electrons , @xmath31 denoting the lorentz factor of electrons which cool on a dynamical timescale , @xmath32 the minimum lorentz factor of the injected electron power - law and @xmath33 the index of this power - law , e.g. panaitescu & kumar ( 2000 ) , sari & esin ( 2001 ) , piran ( 2004 ) .",
    "this @xmath1 parameter also reflects the power of the inverse compton component relatively to the synchrotron component , therefore the ratio of emission at very high energies to that in the x - ray range .",
    "the possibility of a large @xmath1 parameter should thus increase the chances of observating gamma - ray bursts at very high energies with upcoming erenkov telescopes .",
    "the observation of this inverse compton component would then open a new spectral domain with which one could study the microphysics of the turbulence in the blast .",
    "however , the computation of the synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) spectrum of the blast in the large @xmath1 regime is not trivial because the shape of the synchrotron spectrum influences the cooling history of the electrons , which itself determines the synchrotron spectral shape . in particular",
    ", the kn suppression of the inverse compton cross - section may itself modify this cooling history , hence modify the very shape of the synchrotron spectrum , see nakar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , wang et al .",

    "( 2009 ) , daigne et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for related discussions in the context of gamma - ray burst prompt emission . in the case of decaying micro - turbulence , this issue is more acute , because the synchrotron power @xmath34 may be rising with frequency , due to the fact that lower frequency photons are emitted by electrons of longer cooling time , in regions of lower magnetic field strength ( lemoine 2013 ) .",
    "therefore , the lorentz factor - dependent kn limit determines the radiation intensity on which an electron can cool . finally ,",
    "so far the influence of decaying micro - turbulence on the synchrotron spectrum has been studied for a fixed @xmath1 parameter , independent of electron lorentz factor , hence the general shape of the ssc spectrum is not known in this physically relevant case .",
    "these considerations motivate the present study , which calculates the ssc spectrum for a relativistic blast wave in the large @xmath1 regime .",
    "although the prime objective is to understand how the decaying micro - turbulence affects the ssc spectrum , the present discussion also addresses the case of a uniform , low value of @xmath17 .",
    "the results are applied to the case of the grb afterglows , by calculating the spectrum at various observer time and by plotting , in particular , the spectral slopes in various frequency windows .",
    "the spectrum is also evaluated in the multi - gev range , with a proper account of synchrotron and ssc contributions , to make clear predictions for future erenkov observatories such as hawk and cta .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : ssc ] presents an analytical description of the spectrum in the slow - cooling limit , accounting for kn effects , and introduces a fast algorithm to compute this spectrum in the fast cooling regime ; sec .",
    "[ sec : lc ] then computes the light curves and plots the temporal and spectral indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 , commonly defined by @xmath35 , and gives predictions for the very high energy photon flux ; finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] summarizes these results and provides some conclusions .",
    "the set - up is as follows : electrons are swept - up by a relativistic shock front propagating in a density profile @xmath36 , then accelerated on a short time - scale to a power - law @xmath37 above a minimal lorentz factor @xmath32 .",
    "the minimal lorentz factor is defined as usual by @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "cooling takes place on much longer timescales .",
    "when describing the cooling history , the total inverse compton cross - section is modelled as a top - hat , with @xmath40 for @xmath41 and zero otherwise , @xmath42 denoting the frequency of photons with which electrons of lorentz factor @xmath43 interact at the kn limit ( nakar et al .",

    "according to pic simulations , the characteristic ( temporal ) scale @xmath59 separating far from close to the shock front is @xmath60 , see chang et al .",

    "the uncertainty on the value of @xmath59 does not really influence the results presented below , because it can be embedded in that associated to the decay power - law exponent @xmath64 .",
    "recent work mentioned above suggest @xmath65 for a decay law @xmath66 , hence the following adopts @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this decay implies that the minimum magnetic field in the blast , close to the contact discontinuity , is characterized by the equipartition fraction @xmath69 in terms of the dynamical timescale @xmath70 .",
    "typical values are @xmath71s at an observer time of @xmath72s ( e.g. @xmath73 and @xmath74 cm ) , with a mild dependence on the model parameters , leading to values of the order of @xmath75 for @xmath76",
    ". note that @xmath77 evolves slowly as a function of observer time , hence so does @xmath24 .    in this work",
    ", it is assumed that a particle emits its synchrotron radiation at the location at which it cools , if it cools on a dynamical timescale ; in the opposite limit , it is assumed that it emits its synchrotron photons in the magnetic field close to the contact discontinuity , of strength @xmath78 ( associated to the parameter @xmath24 ) .",
    "the justification of this approximation is as follows : the energy emitted in synchrotron photons by a particle up to time @xmath55 , along its trajectory downstream of the shock , can be written as @xmath79 as a function of the time dependent lorentz factor @xmath80 of the particle along its cooling trajectory , with @xmath81 the particle velocity in units of @xmath82 .",

    ". one should emphasize that in the above expressions , @xmath43 represents the initial lorentz factor of the particle , after acceleration has shaped the power - law , but before cooling has effectively taken place .",
    "standard calculations of the synchrotron spectrum of a blast wave generally derive the stationary electron distribution in the blast , by solving a transport equation in momentum space , averaged over the depth of the blast , accounting for injection of the power - law at the shock and for cooling downstream ( e.g. sari et al .",
    "1998 , sari & esin 2001 ) ; this yields a standard broken power - law shape @xmath119 with indices @xmath120 for @xmath121 or @xmath33 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "however , one can also derive the synchrotron spectrum by a direct mapping of the energy initially stored into the electron population to that radiated in synchrotron ; this approach is simpler in the present case and it works as follows .",
    "electrons injected with lorentz factor @xmath125 emit a fraction @xmath126^{-1}$ ] of their energy in synchrotron radiation ; the energy density contained in such electrons ( within an interval @xmath127 ) is itself a fraction @xmath128 of the energy density @xmath129 contained in electrons immediately behind the shock front , before cooling has started to take place ; @xmath130 .",
    "consequently , the synchrotron flux received at frequency @xmath131 can be written : @xmath132 the above assumes @xmath133 , but it can be generalized to any index @xmath134 ; indeed , the above picture assumes that particles with @xmath135 radiate their energy at @xmath118 then do not contribute anymore to the synchrotron spectrum , which is a reasonable approximation if @xmath134 ; in contrast , if @xmath136 , the radiation of the high energy particles during their complete cooling history dominates that of the lower energy ones .",
    "similarly , one can write down the flux for @xmath137 or @xmath138 , whichever occurs , as follows : @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 . the spectrum at @xmath142 is indeed unchanged with respect to the standard case , although the value of @xmath143 must be used to compute the characteristic frequencies .",
    "regarding the fast cooling limit @xmath121 , the factor can be understood by noting that all injected particles with @xmath144 shift from @xmath43 to @xmath31 during their cooling history , and that at each point along this cooling trajectory they radiate ( in synchrotron ) a fraction @xmath145 of the energy radiated ( in synchrotron ) by a particle of lorentz factor @xmath146 .",
    "note also that in the limits @xmath147 , @xmath148 , one recovers the usual scaling @xmath149 since @xmath150 .",
    "provided @xmath31 and @xmath114 are given , one can derive @xmath118 and @xmath117 , hence @xmath151 and @xmath152 by using eqs .",

    "this latter scaling matches the explicit calculation of lemoine ( 2013 ) , which computes the integrated cooling history of the electron power - law in the decaying magnetic field .",

    "the synchrotron spectral density @xmath161 must be folded over the compton cross - section and the cooled particle distribution , integrated over the blast .",
    "the following derivation of the cooled distribution function relies on the observations that @xmath162 and that the cooling history @xmath163 at times @xmath164 does not depend on the history at times @xmath165 , i.e. electrons of various lorentz factor follow a universal cooling trajectory @xmath163 .",
