    "discrete symmetries have been extensively used in an attempt to describe the observed patterns in fermion masses and mixing angles ( for a thorough list of references see  @xcite ) .",
    "typical scenarios include some of the following ingredients :    * introduction of a flavor symmetry , usually a product between a non - abelian and several abelian discrete groups",
    ". there can be different groups for different sectors ( quark or leptonic ) or only for one of the sectors .",
    "* introduction of heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this provides dirac and majorana mass terms for neutrinos and allows one to consider , for example , generation of small neutrino majorana masses using some version of the seesaw mechanism  @xcite . *",
    "introduction of several scalar fields charged under the flavor symmetry that may or not acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , thus breaking or not the flavor symmetry .",
    "these scalars may or not be singlets under the standard model ( sm ) gauge group .",
    "typically there are high energy scales associated to the vevs of these fields ( when they are singlets under the sm gauge group ) . with a few exceptions ,",
    "the extended scalar sector can have collider relevant phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "* neutrino masses can be generated , in addition to the seesaw mechanism , through higher order operators that violate lepton number  @xcite or through quantum ( radiative ) corrections  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the ingredients above can be used in the frameworks ( or combination thereof ) of supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric models , grand unified theories , extra dimensional models , and so on .",
    "also the list is not exhaustive and includes only some of the most important and general considerations .    among the possibilities generated by these ingredients , one that has been recently explored",
    "consists of creating renormalizable models  @xcite , i.e. models that forbid the inclusion of higher ( @xmath1 ) dimension operators .",
    "there are two main challenges in this approach .",
    "first , it is highly nontrivial to create a model based on a single discrete group that can accommodate both quarks and leptons .",
    "second , since no higher order operators are allowed , obtaining small neutrino masses is not trivial .",
    "for example in  @xcite a renormalizable model is investigated that uses the discrete group @xmath2 , and where neutrino masses are generated by the seesaw mechanism .",
    "another example is the work in  @xcite where a renormalizable model with flavor symmetry @xmath3 is presented .",
    "neutrino masses however are generated by the dimension 5 , non renormalizable operator @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we present a model based on the single discrete group @xmath0 , the double tetrahedral group , that accommodates both the quark and leptonic sectors .",
    "the model is renormalizable and neutrino masses are generated radiatively . in order to accomplish this we introduce several scalar fields charged under hypercharge and lepton number .",
    "@xmath0 is the smallest group we find to work under all of these considerations ( see  @xcite for different models based on this group ) .",
    "we present a model based on the discrete group @xmath0 that is renormalizable , i.e. we do not use higher dimension operators in order to generate patterns nor hierarchies .",
    "it only includes the standard model matter content and thus does not include right - handed neutrinos .",
    "neutrino masses are thus zero at tree level and get generated only radiatively .",
    "the scalar sector is extended to include three su(2 ) doublet fields , as well as a set of su(2 ) singlet fields charged under lepton number and hypercharge that explicitly break lepton number conservation .",
    "these fields are needed in order to generate neutrino masses radiatively .",
    "@xmath5 is the group of all 24 proper rotations in three dimensions leaving a regular tetrahedron invariant in the su(2 ) double covering of so(3 )  @xcite .",
    "it has seven irreducible representations : for more details about @xmath5 . ] three singlets , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , three doublets , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and one triplet , @xmath10 , with the following multiplication rules : @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for any representation .",
    "triality flips sign under hermitian conjugation .",
    "as stated above , the matter content of the model is exactly that of the sm .",
    "all matter fields transform as @xmath13 under @xmath0 , and there are no right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the scalar sector contains three su(2 ) doublets ( @xmath14 ) : @xmath15 , and @xmath16 with the @xmath0 transformations @xmath17 and three su(2 ) singlet , @xmath18 , @xmath19 scalars @xmath20 and @xmath21 transforming as @xmath22    given these assignments the yukawa mass matrices have the following representation structure : @xmath23 and all neutrinos are massless .",
    "fermion masses ( except for neutrinos ) are generated when the electroweak symmetry gets broken by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the su(2 ) doublet scalars , which we assume take the following form : @xmath24    we now proceed to describe the quark and lepton sectors separately .",
    "given the @xmath0 representations for quarks and su(2 ) doublets we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "once the scalars acquire vevs we obtain the following mass matrices : @xmath27 where each entry depends on both the values of the vevs and the yukawa couplings .",
    "we see that these matrices can be parametrized as @xmath28    these matrices are similar to those found by fritzsch for a three family model  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . following that analysis and taking @xmath29 , we rewrite the mass matrices above in terms of the quark masses and free parameters @xmath30  @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 and where @xmath37 are matrices with real entries obtained from the phase factorization of @xmath38  @xcite through @xmath39 with @xmath40 diagonal phase matrices such that @xmath41 .",
    "the free parameters are then @xmath30 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , and the ckm matrix is given by @xmath44 where the @xmath45 matrices diagonalize @xmath46 via , @xmath47    using the values @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 we obtain @xmath52 in perfect agreement with the experimental data  @xcite @xmath53      the analysis made for the quark sector extends directly to the charged leptons .",
    "the mass matrix can then be written as before ( see eq.([mumdfinal ] ) ) : @xmath54    calling @xmath55 the matrix that diagonalizes @xmath56 , and using the values for the charged lepton masses taken from  @xcite , we obtain @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    for neutrinos",
    "the situation is different .",
    "we are assuming that neutrinos are majorana type and that their masses can be induced by radiative corrections , thus making them light naturally  @xcite .    in absence of right - handed neutrinos",
    "the only possible mass terms for left - handed neutrinos are majorana mass terms .",
    "the simplest mass term in this case , without the introduction of scalars with non trivial su(2 ) representations , is the dimension five operator with form @xmath60 .",
    "although this term is non - renormalizable , it may be induced by radiative corrections if we introduce a scalar field that breaks lepton number ( provided there are at least two su(2 ) higgs doublets @xcite ) .",
    "this is why we have introduced the fields @xmath20 and @xmath61 in our renormalizable model .",
    "in order to see how this works , consider the following example : a two higgs doublet model with sm fermion content and an additional scalar field @xmath62 with charges @xmath63 under @xmath64 and lepton number @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the yukawa couplings of @xmath62 are @xmath65 where @xmath66 are su(2 ) indices , @xmath67 are family indices , @xmath68 from fermi statistics , and @xmath69 denotes the su(2 ) lepton doublets .",
    "if there are two ( or more ) higgs doublets , there will be a cubic coupling term like @xmath70 with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "this term explicitly violates lepton number and allows the generation of majorana masses for the neutrinos .    notice that eqs .",
    "( [ lyuk ] ) and ( [ lcubic ] ) ( together with the usual yukawa term from the lepton sector ) lead to the diagram shown in figure  [ fig : loop ] that contributes to a majorana mass term as @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the charged higgs mass and @xmath75 the mass of the singlet field @xmath62 .",
    "term induces mixings between @xmath76 and @xmath77 however , we expect @xmath78 , and work in the approximation that treats @xmath75 and @xmath74 as the physical masses . ]",
    "thus , the total contribution , including the diagram with @xmath79 and @xmath80 interchanged ( which has the same form as in ( [ mab ] ) but with @xmath81 ) is @xmath82 with  @xcite @xmath83        coming back to our model , the terms relevant for neutrino mass generation are then given by @xmath84 where we have omitted su(2 ) indices , @xmath85 denote the left handed lepton su(2 ) doublets , and @xmath86 denote the right handed lepton su(2 ) singlets ( recall that the fermion fields transform as @xmath13 under @xmath0 ) .",
    "eq.([lyuk ] ) is the usual yukawa term for leptons , and eq.([lllh ] ) comes from the general term in eq.([lyuk ] ) , with @xmath87 family indices",
    ".    finally eq.([lhhh ] ) contains the allowed trilinear coupling of @xmath61 with the su(2 ) doublet scalar fields present in the model .",
    "eq.([lhhh ] ) represents the explicit lepton number violating term involving the scalar fields @xmath20 and @xmath61 necessary in order to generate majorana masses for the neutrinos .",
    "the resulting non zero neutrino mass matrix elements are then given by @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91    assuming that @xmath92  o(1 ) , @xmath93  gev , and noting that @xmath94 must be at the same scale of @xmath95 , then @xmath96  gev leads to matrix elements of o(ev ) .",
    "the majorana neutrino mass matrix then has the texture : @xmath97 where all entries are o(ev ) .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath98 is obtained by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the unitary matrix that diagonalizes the square of the charged leptons matrix , and @xmath101 is the unitary matrix that diagonalizes @xmath102 .    in order to perform the numerical analysis we used the following experimental results  @xcite : @xmath103 and @xmath104 since the absolute mass scale in the neutrino sector is not known , we use the following ratio @xmath105    in order to determine whether the mass matrices in this model can reproduce these results , we performed a scan of the complete range in all three angles .",
    "then for each case where a solution consistent with all three angles was found , we computed the ratio in eq.([mass - ratio ] ) and selected those solutions that fell within its allowed range .",
    "we found that solutions exist with the following properties :    * all solutions have an inverted hierarchy for neutrino masses .",
    "* there are solutions for all the allowed ranges in @xmath106 and @xmath107 but only for @xmath108 ( see figure  [ fig : angles ] ) .    , @xmath106 , and @xmath109 ( in radians ) that can be obtained with the model presented in this paper .",
    "all points on this surface represent cases where the mass ratio defined in eq.([mass - ratio ] ) falls in the desired range.,width=377 ]",
    "we sought to find a renormalizable fermion mass model based on a single discrete group , and with the minimum number of additions to the standard model .",
    "we found that it is possible to do so provided that neutrino masses are generated radiatively , and that no right handed neutrinos are present .",
    "the smallest discrete group that worked under these considerations is the double tetrahedral group @xmath0 .",
    "a specific realization of a model is presented .",
    "it contains the standard model fermion content and a scalar sector that involves three su(2 ) doublets as well as a set of lepton number violating ( charged ) scalars , needed to give mass to the neutrinos .    in the quark sector",
    "the model leads to a fritzsch type scenario that is consistent with all the existing data . in the lepton sector",
