    "most vehicle mounted hydrophones used in passive sonar sensors are mounted inside stiff sonar windows in order to protect the sensors and to reduce the hydrodynamical drag / vibrations of the sensors .",
    "on the one hand , when the vessel is in motion , the structure is excited by turbulent flow , and on the other hand , the generated turbulence causes additional noise .",
    "thus , the acoustic waves of these contributions propagate to the position of the hydrophone and disturb the incoming signal .",
    "the aim of the paper is an investigation of flow noise generation and transport mechanisms w.r.t .",
    "different materials and geometries .",
    "the knowledge of these mechanisms could be used to maximize the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the mathematical modeling and a combined numerical / analytical solution of passive sonar acoustics will be validated against experiments . in order to consider real life underwater scenarios ,",
    "the experiments involve sea trials with a test towed body , which realizes a typical broadband sonar environment ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . on the starboard side",
    ", the hull of the test towed body includes a linear elastic plate , which is in front of the measurement system .",
    "this system consists of a line array having equally spaced hydrophones inside a water - filled measurement box , which is designed to protect the sensors from background noise .",
    "furthermore , the box is mounted in such a way that it is decoupled from the body frame . in this way noise from the environment conditions",
    "could be minimised .",

    "we identify the dominant flow noise sources by a dimensional analysis of the williams and hawkings equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . in section 3",
    "we describe these noise sources and the underlying coupling effects by a set of partial differential equation and boundary conditions . as a first test of the modeling approach ,",
    "the coupled problem is solved by a finite element method and compared with the sea trial results .",
    "then , in section 4 , we give the analytical solutions of the problems with the help of an eigenfunction expansion method .",
    "from the point of view of dimensional analysis , which considers the relationships between the hydrodynamical and acoustic quantities , it is impossible to attack the problem at once . therefore , we use a non - empirical tailoring which is tractable with state of the art analytical and numerical methods and considers the conditions of the towed body . in order to meet this demand ,",
    "this section is devoted to the investigation of the dominant flow noise sources .    the physical mechanisms of flow noise generation and propagation in air and water is governed by the navier - stokes equation . because of the same underlying equation for the density @xmath3 the velocity @xmath4 and the pressure @xmath5 it seems surprising that the fields of aeroacoustics and hydroacoustics have developed relatively independently of each other . however",
    ", if we realise that the different compressibility of both media are responsible for different dominant flow noise sources , this development becomes easy to understand and help us to choose the correct mathematical modelling . to investigate the flow noise sources we consider an isentropic flow with @xmath6 @xmath7 here and in what follows",

    ". obviously , the second term on the right hand side and therefore the structural vibrations are the dominant sound sources for practical hydrodynamic flows @xmath27 in other words , the following tailoring approach could neglect the volume based turbulent flow noise and should take into account the plate vibrations .",
    "in order to describe the interaction of the flexible plate with the turbulent flow outside and the acoustic waves inside the measurement box , it is assumed that there is no feedback of the plate vibrations on the turbulent flow ( single side coupling ) .",
    "namely , the hydrodynamic pressure is added as a source term in the two side coupling of bending and acoustic waves .",
    "the validity of this hybrid approach is investigated by the evaluation of the acoustic pressure in the frequency / wave number domain .",
    "this way , we can check if the source term interpretation of the hydrodynamic flow leads to valid transport mechanisms of the coupled waves .    in this approach",
    ", we have to start with a broadband hydrodynamical field in a computational domain over the sonar window . to meet this demand ,",
    "the incompressible navier - stokes equations are solved by a large eddy simulation ( les ) , where the larger scales are resolved and the effects on the smaller scales are considered by a subgrid - scale model . moreover",

    "finally , the coupling of the plate vibrations with the acoustic field has to be solved . here",
    ", it is assumed that the vibrations of a plate with thickness @xmath28 and displacements @xmath29 satisfy the following condition @xmath30 then the displacement @xmath29 takes place only in the perpendicular direction .",
    "therefore , the acoustic interaction appears only in the same direction .",
    "consequently , the tangential domain boundaries and the associated acoustic boundary conditions in the measurement box are of minor importance and could be considered as a sound hard wall on a rectangular wall . in order to represent the material properties of the measurement box , the wall on the back side is equipped with an impedance boundary condition .    next , the mathematical problem and a connected numerical simulation of the coupled acoustic and bending wave problem are presented .",
    "we start by introducing the modelling domain , which was already mentioned in a loose way in the introduction .",
    "let the measurement box be a rectangular domain @xmath31 with the side lengths @xmath32 the plate with uniform thickness @xmath28 is located at @xmath33 moreover , the hydrophones are mounted on the line @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a given parameter .",

    "the wall displacement satisfies the plate boundary conditions @xmath48 and the pressure conditions for the side and rear walls @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the acoustic impedance .    at the end of this section",
    ", we present numerical results of the above problem , which are obtained by a usual finite element method with second order polynomial shape functions . for the time discretisation",
