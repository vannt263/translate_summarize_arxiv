    "it is suggested in the preceding paper@xcite ( hereafter referred to as part i ) that concepts and methods of statistical physics for open dynamical complex systems far from equilibrium can be used in describing the phenomena associated with large rapidity gap ( lrg ) events in deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering@xcite and other inelastic diffractive scattering processes@xcite .",
    "this approach is motivated by the following observations :    first , lrg events in deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering have been observed@xcite in the small-@xmath6 region ( @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 , say )  a kinematic region in which low - energy ( soft ) gluons dominate@xcite .",
    "this piece of experimental facts indicates that the occurrence of lrg events and the observed gluon - domination in this region are very much related to each other .",
    "second , the characteristic properties of the gluons  in particular the local gluon - gluon coupling prescribed by the qcd - lagrangian , the confinement , and the non - conservation of gluon - numbers  strongly suggest that systems of interacting soft gluons should be considered as _",
    "open , dynamical , complex _ systems with _ many degrees of freedom , _ and that such systems are in general _ far from equilibrium_.    third , it has been proposed by bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw)@xcite some time ago , that a wide class of open dynamical complex systems far from equilibrium may evolve in a self - organized manner to critical states , where perturbations caused by local interactions can initiate long - range - correlations through `` domino effects '' which lead to spatial and temporal fluctuations extending over all length and time scales  in form of avalanches ( which we call btw - avalanches in part i and hereafter ) .",
    "the size - distributions and the lifetime - distributions of such avalanches exhibit _ power - law behaviors_. these behaviors are _ universal _ and _ robust_. in fact these behaviors are considered as _ the fingerprints of self - organized criticality _ ( soc ) . in the macroscopic world , there are many open dynamical complex systems which show this kind of power - law behaviors@xcite : sandpiles , earthquakes , wood - fire , evolution , traffic jam , stock market etc .",
    "having these observations in mind , we are automatically led to the questions : can self - organized criticality also exist in the microscopic world  at the level of gluons and quarks ?",
    "in particular , can there be btw - avalanches in systems of interacting soft gluons ?",
    "is it possible to probe the existence and the properties of such avalanches experimentally  by examing reactions in which the interactions of soft gluons play a significant role ?    to answer these questions ,",
    "it is useful to recall the following : inelastic diffractive scattering processes are characterized ( see e.g. gallo in ref.[[smalltnew ] ] and the papers cited therein ) by large rapidity gaps in the final state and the existence of such gaps has been interpreted as the consequence of `` the exchange of colorless objects . '' these objects can be , and have been @xcite , associated with color - singlet systems / clusters of interacting soft gluons .",
    "such colorless objects can exist inside and/or outside the proton , and the interactions between such color - singlets , as well as those between such objects and `` the mother proton '' , should be of van der waals type .",
    "hence it is expected that such colorless objects can be easily separated from the other color - singlets including `` the mother proton '' in peripheral collision processes , in which ( in contrast to `` hard scattering '' ) not much transfer of momentum is needed .",
    "furthermore , since the process of `` carring away '' or `` knocking - out '' of such a colorless object from the proton is comparable with the knocking - out of a nucleon off a nucleus by energetic beam - particles , it is also expected that the characteristic features ( which does not include the absolute values of the cross - sections ) of such inelastic diffractive processes should be _ independent _ of the incident energy , and _ independent _ of the quantum - numbers of the projectile .",
    "based on these knowledge and expectations , we performed a systematic analysis@xcite of the existing data for inelastic diffractive scattering in electron - proton scattering processes @xcite , in photoproduction @xcite , and in proton - proton and proton - antiproton collisions @xcite .",
    "the obtained results ( which are presented in part i ) can be summarized as follows :    the data @xcite show that the above - mentioned characteristic features for soc _ indeed exist _ , and that the relevant exponents in such power - laws are approximately the _ same _ for _ different _ reactions .",
    "the observed features imply that a color - singlet gluon - cluster is a btw - avalanche , and as such , it can have _ neither a typical size , nor a typical lifetime , nor a given static structure_. in fact , it has much in common with an earthquake , or an avalanche of snow ( see sections 2 , 4 and 5 of part i ) . by examing the data for inelastic diffractive scattering processes performed at different incident energies and/or in which different kinds of beam - particles are used",
    ", we are able to extract information about the colorless objects without specifying their structures . furthermore , since the obtained results are approximatly independent of the incident energy and independent of the quantum numbers of the projectile , we can conclude that the extracted knowledge about the color - singlet gluon - clusters are universal .",
    "hence , the following picture emerges :    viewed from the beam - particle , the target - proton in diffractive scattering appears as a `` cloud '' of colorless objects which in general exist partly inside and partly outside the confinement region of the proton .",
    "such objects are color - singlet gluon - clusters which exhibit the characteristic features of btw - avalanches as a consequence of soc . in ( geometrically speaking )",
    "more peripheral scattering processes , such as inelastic diffractive scattering , the beam - particle will encounter one of these color - singlet gluon - clusters and `` carry it away '' , because the interaction between the struck object and any other neighboring color - singlets ( including the `` mother proton '' ) are expected to be of van der waals type .",
    "we note , in part i of this paper , we simply adopted the currently popular definition of `` inelastic diffractive scattering processes '' .",
    "that is , when we talked about `` inelastic diffractive scattering '' we were always referring to processes in which `` colorless objects '' are `` exchanged '' . in other words , in that part of the paper , the following question has _ not _ been asked : are the above - mentioned `` inelastic _ diffractive _ scattering processes '' indeed comparable with _ diffraction _ in optics , in the sense that the beam particles should be considered as waves , and the target - proton together with the associated ( in whatever manner ) colorless objects can indeed be viewed as a `` scattering screen '' ?    in part ii of this paper , we discuss in detail this question , and we examine in particular the existing data @xcite for the double differential cross - section @xmath4 for proton - proton and antiproton - proton collisions ( where @xmath0 is the 4-momentum - transfer squared , @xmath2 is the missing - mass , and @xmath3 is the total c.m.s .",
    "energy ) . to be more precise ,",
    "what we wish to find out in this connection is :  can the observed @xmath0-dependence and the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath4 in the given kinematic range ( @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath10 @xmath12 , @xmath13@xmath10@xmath3@xmath10 @xmath14 , and @xmath15@xmath10 @xmath16 ) be understood in terms of the well - known concept of diffraction in optics ?",
    "the answer to this question is of particular interest for several reasons :    \\(a ) high - energy proton - proton and proton - antiproton scattering at small momentum transfer has played , and is still playing a very special role in understanding diffraction and/or diffractive dissociation in lepton- , photon- and hadron - induced reactions@xcite .",
    "many experiments have been performed at various incident energies for elastic and inelastic diffractive scattering processes .",
    "it is known that the double differential cross section @xmath4 is a quantity which can yield much information on the reaction mechanism(s ) and/or on the structure of the participating colliding objects . in the past ,",
    "the @xmath0- , @xmath2- and @xmath17-dependence of the differential cross - sections for inelastic diffractive scattering processes has been presented in different forms , where a number of interesting features have been observed@xcite .",
    "for example , it is seen that , the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath18 at fixed @xmath17 depends very much on @xmath2 ; the @xmath19-dependence of @xmath18 at fixed @xmath0 depends on @xmath17 .",
    "but , when @xmath4 is plotted as function of @xmath15 at given @xmath0 -values ( in the range @xmath20 ) they are approximately independent of @xmath17 !",
    "what do these observed striking features tell us ?",
    "the first precision measurement of this quantity was published more than twenty years ago@xcite .",
    "can this , as well as the more recent @xmath4-data@xcite be understood theoretically ?",
    "\\(b ) the idea of using optical and/or geometrical analogies to describe high - energy hadron - nucleus and hadron - hadron collisions at small scattering angles has been discussed by many authors @xcite many years ago .",
    "it is shown in particular that this approach is very useful and successful in describing elastic scattering .",
    "however , it seems that , until now , no attempt has been made to describe the data@xcite by performing quantitative calculations for @xmath4 by using optical geometrical analogies .",
    "it seems worthwhile to make such an attempt .",
    "this is because , it has been pointed out@xcite very recently , that the above - mentioned analogy can be made to understand the observed @xmath0-dependence in @xmath21 .",
    "\\(c ) since inelastic diffractive @xmath22- and @xmath23-scattering belongs to those soft processes in which the initial and final states are well - known hadrons , it is expected that also they can be described in the well - known regge - pole approach @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of this approach is that colorless objects in form of regge trajectories ( pomerons , reggions etc . )",
    "are exchanged during the collision , and such trajectories are responsible for the dynamics of the scattering processes . in this approach ,",
    "it is the @xmath0-dependence of the regge trajectories , the @xmath0-dependence of the corresponding regge residue functions , the properties of the coupling of the contributing trajectories ( e.g. triple pomeron or pomeron - reggion - pomeron coupling ) , and the number of contributing regge trajectories which determine the experimentally observed @xmath0- and @xmath2-dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "a number of regge - pole models@xcite have been proposed , and there exist good fits @xcite to the data . what remains to be understood in this approach is the dynamical origin of the regge - trajectories on the one hand , and the physical meaning of the unknown functions ( for example the @xmath0-dependence of any one of the regge - residue functions ) on the other .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite , that there may be an overlap between the `` partons in pomeron and reggeons '' picture and the soc - picture @xcite , and that one way to study the possible relationship between the two approaches is to take a closer look at the double differential cross - section @xmath4 .",
    "let us begin our discussion on the above - mentioned questions by recalling that the concept of `` diffraction '' or `` diffractive scattering '' has its origin in optics , and optics is part of electrodynamics , which is not only the _ classical limit _ , but also _ the basis _ of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . here , it is useful to recall in particular the following : optical diffraction is associated with departure from geometrical optics caused by the finite wavelength of light .",
    "frauenhofer diffraction can be observed by placing a scatterer ( which can in general be a scattering screen with more than one aperture or a system of scattering objects ) in the path of propagation of light ( the wavelength of which is less than the linear dimension of the scatterer ) where not only the light - source , but also the detecting device , are very far away from the scatterer .",
    "the parallel incident light - rays can be considered as plane waves ( characterized by a set of constants @xmath24 , and @xmath25 say , which denote the wave vector , the frequency and the amplitude of a component of the electromagnetic field respectively in the laboratory frame ) . after the scattering , the scattered field can be written in accordance with huygens principle as @xmath26 here , @xmath27 stands for a component of the field originating from the scatterer , @xmath28 is the wave vector of the scattered light in the direction of observation , @xmath29 is the corresponding frequency , @xmath30 is the distance between the scatterer and the observation point @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ) is the ( unnormalized ) scattering amplitude which describes the change of the wave vector in the scattering process . by choosing a coordinate system in which the @xmath33-axis coincides with the incident wave vector @xmath34",
    ", the scattering amplitude can be expressed as follows@xcite @xmath35 here , @xmath36 determines the change in wave vector due to diffraction ; @xmath37 is the impact parameter which indicates the position of an infinitesimal surface element on the wave - front `` immediately behind the scatterer '' where the incident wave would reach in the limit of geometrical optics , and @xmath38 is the corresponding amplitude ( associated with the boundary conditions which the scattered field should satisfy ) in the two - dimensional impact - parameter - space ( which is here the @xmath39-plane ) , and the integration extends over the region @xmath40 in which @xmath38 is different from zero . in those cases in which the scatterer is symmetric with respect to the scattering axis ( here the @xmath33-axis ) , eq.(2 ) can be expressed , by using an integral representation for @xmath41 , as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the magnitudes of @xmath45 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "the following should be mentioned in connection with eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) : many of the well - known phenomena related to frauenhofer diffraction have been deduced@xcite from these equations under the additional condition ( which is directly related to the boundary conditions imposed on the scattered field ) @xmath46 , that is , @xmath28 differs from @xmath34 only in direction . in other words ,",
    "the outgoing light wave has exactly the same frequency , and exactly the same magnitude of wave - vector as those for the incoming wave .",
    "( this means , quantum mechanically speaking , the outgoing photons are also on - shell photons , the energies of which are the same as the incoming ones . ) in such cases , it is possible to envisage that @xmath45 is approximately perpendicular to @xmath34 and to @xmath28 , that is , @xmath45 is approximately perpendicular to the chosen @xmath33-axis , and thus in the above - mentioned @xmath39-plane ( that is @xmath47 ) . while the scattering angle distribution in such processes ( which are considered as the characteristic features of _ elastic _ diffractive scattering ) plays a significant role in understanding the observed diffraction phenomena ,",
    "it is of considerable importance to note the following :    \\(a ) eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) can be used to describe diffractive scattering with , or without , this additional condition , provided that the difference of @xmath28 and @xmath34 in the longitudinal direction ( i.e. in the direction of @xmath34 ) is small compared to @xmath48 so that @xmath49 can be approximated by @xmath45 . in fact , eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) are strictly valid when @xmath45 is a vector in the above - mentioned @xmath39-plane , that is when we write @xmath49 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "now , since eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) in such a form ( that is when the replacement @xmath50 is made ) are valid _ without _ the condition @xmath45 should approximately be equal to @xmath49 and in particular without the additional condition @xmath46 , it is clear that they are also valid for _ inelastic _ scattering processes .",
    "in other words , eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) can also be used to describe _",
    "inelastic _ diffractive scattering ( that is , processes in which @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) provided that the following replacements are made . in eq.(2 ) , @xmath50 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ; and in eq.(3 ) @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "hereafter , we shall call eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) with these replacements eq.(2@xmath58 ) and eq.(3@xmath58 ) respectively .",
    "we note , in order to specify the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( that is on @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , further information on energy - momentum transfer in such scattering processes is needed .",
    "this point will be discussed in more detail in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "\\(b ) in scattering processes at large momentum - transfer where the magnitude of @xmath64 is large ( @xmath65 , say ) , it is less probable to find diffractive scattering events in which the additional condition @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be satisfied .",
    "this means , it is expected that most of the diffraction - phenomena observed in such processes are associated with inelastic diffractive scattering .",
    "\\(c ) change in angle but no change in magnitude of wave - vectors or frequencies is likely to occur in processes in which neither absorption nor emission of light takes place .",
    "hence , it is not difficult to imagine , that the above - mentioned condition can be readily satisfied in cases where the scattering systems are time - independent macroscopic apertures or objects .",
    "but , in this connection , we are also forced to the question : `` how large is the chance for a incident wave _ not _ to change the magnitude of its wave - vector in processes in which the scatterers are _ open dynamical complex systems _ , where energy- and momentum - exchange take place at anytime and everywhere ? ! ''",
    "the picture for inelastic diffractive scattering has two basic ingredients :    first , having the well - known phenomena associated with frauenhofer s diffraction and the properties of de broglie s matter waves in mind , the beam particles ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 or @xmath71 shown in fig.8 of part i ) in these scattering processes are considered as high - frequency waves passing through a medium . since , in general , energy- and momentum - transfer take place during the passage through the medium , the wave - vector of the outgoing wave differs , in general , from the incoming one , not only in direction , but also in magnitude . for the same reason , the frequency and the longitudinal component of the wave - vector of the outgoing wave ( that is the energy , and/or the invariant mass , as well as the longitudinal momentum of the outgoing particles ) can be different from their incoming counterparts .",
    "second , according to the results obtained in part i ( and summarized in the introduction of part ii ) of this paper , the medium is a system of color - singlet gluon - clusters which are in general partly inside and partly outside the proton  in form of a `` cluster cloud''@xcite . since the average binding energy between such color - singlet aggregates are of van der waals type@xcite , and thus it is negligibly small compared with the corresponding binding energy between colored objects , we expect to see that , even at relatively small values of momentum - transfer ( @xmath11@xmath7@xmath72,say ) , the struck colorless clusters can unify with ( be absorbed by ) the beam - particle , and `` be carried away '' by the latter , similar to the process of `` knocking out nucleons '' from nuclear targets in high - energy hadron - nucleus collisions .",
    "it should , however , be emphasized that , in contrast to the nucleons in nucleus , the colorless gluon - clusters which can exist inside or outside the confinement - region of the proton are _ not _ hadron - like ( see sections 3 - 6 of part i for more details ) .",
    "they are btw - avalanches which have neither a typical size , nor a typical lifetime , nor a given static structure .",
    "their size- and lifetime - distributions obey simple power - laws as consequence of soc .",
    "this means , in the diffraction processes discussed here , the size of the scatterer(s ) , and thus the size of the carried - away colorless gluon - cluster(s ) , is in general different in every scattering event .",
    "it should also be emphasized that these characteristic features of the scatterer are consequences of the basic properties of the gluons .",
    "to model the proposed picture quantitatively , it is convenient to consider the scattering system in the rest frame of the proton target . here , we choose a right - handed cartesian coordinate with its origin @xmath73 at the center of the target - proton , and the @xmath33-axis in the direction of the incident beam .",
    "the @xmath39-plane in this coordinate system coincides with the two - dimensional impact - parameter space mentioned in connection with eqs.(2@xmath58 ) and ( 3@xmath58 ) [ which are respectively eq.(2 ) and eq.(3 ) after the replacements mentioned in ( a ) below eq.(3 ) ] , while the @xmath74-plane is the scattering plane .",
    "we note , since we are dealing with inelastic scattering ( where the momentum transfer , including its component in the longitudinal direction , can be large ; in accordance with the uncertainty principle ) it is possible to envisage that ( the c.m.s.of ) the incident particle in the beam meets colorless gluon - clusters at one point @xmath75 . where the projection of @xmath76 along the @xmath77-axis characterizes the corresponding impact parameter @xmath78 .",
    "we recall that such clusters are avalanches initiated by local perturbations ( caused by local gluon - interactions associated with absorption or emission of one or more gluons ; see part i for details ) of soc states in systems of interacting soft gluons .",
    "since gluons carry color , the interactions which lead to the formation of _ colorless _ gluon - clusters must take place inside the confinement region of the proton .",
    "this means , while a considerable part of such colorless clusters in the cloud can be outside the proton , the location @xmath79 , where such an avalanche is initiated , _ must _ be _ inside _ the proton .",
    "that is , in terms of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and proton s radius @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 ^",
    "2=b^2+z^2+r^2 - 2(b^2+z^2)^{1/2 } r \\cos\\angle boa$ ] . for a given impact parameter @xmath44",
    ", it is useful to know the distance @xmath85 between @xmath86 and @xmath79 , as well as `` the average squared distance '' @xmath87 , @xmath88 , which is obtained by averaging over all allowed locations of @xmath79 in the confinement region .",
    "that is , we can model _ the effect of confinement _ in cluster - formation by picturing that all the avalanches , in particular those which contribute to scattering events characterized by a given @xmath44 and a given @xmath33 are initiated from an `` effective initial point '' @xmath89 , because only the mean distance between @xmath79 and @xmath86 plays a role .",
    "( we note , since we are dealing with a complex system with many degrees of freedom , in which @xmath86 as well as @xmath79 are randomly chosen points in space , we can compare _ the mean distance _ between @xmath86 and @xmath79 with the mean free path in a gas mixture of two kinds of gas molecules  `` species @xmath86 '' and `` species @xmath79 '' say , where those of the latter kind are confined inside a subspace called `` region @xmath71 '' .",
    "for _ a given mean distance _ , and _ a given point @xmath86 _ , there is in general a set of @xmath79 s inside the `` region @xmath71 '' , such that their distance to @xmath86 is _ equal _ to the given mean value .",
    "hence it is useful to introduce a _ representative _",
    "point @xmath90 , such that the distance between @xmath90 and @xmath86 is equal to the given mean distance . )",
    "furthermore , since an avalanche is a dynamical object , it may propagate within its lifetime in any one of the @xmath91 directions away from @xmath90 .",
    "( note : avalanches of the same size may have different lifetimes , different structures , as well as different shapes .",
    "the location of an avalanche in space - time is referred to its center - of - mass . )",
    "having seen how soc and confinement can be implemented in describing the properties and the dynamics of colorless gluon - clusters , which are nothing else but btw - avalanches in systems of interacting soft gluons , let us now go one step further , and discuss how these results can be used to obtain the amplitudes in impact - parameter - space that leads , via eq.(3 ) , to the scattering amplitudes .",
    "in contrast to the usual cases , where the scatterer in the optical geometrical picture of a diffractive scattering process is an aperture , or an object , with a given static structure , the scatterer in the proposed picture is an open dynamical complex system of colorless gluon - clusters in form of btw - avalanches .",
    "this implies in particular : the object(s ) , which the beam particle hits , has ( have ) neither a typical size , nor a typical lifetime , nor a given static structure .    with these in mind ,",
    "let us now come back to our discussion on the double differential cross section @xmath4 .",
    "here , we need to determine the corresponding amplitude @xmath92 in eq.(3@xmath58 ) [ see the discussion in ( a ) below eq.(3 ) ] .",
    "what we wish to do now , is to focus our attention on those scattered matter - waves whose de broglie wavelengths are determined by the energy - momentum of the scattered object , whose invariant mass is @xmath2 .",
    "for this purpose , we characterize the corresponding @xmath92 by considering it as a function of @xmath2 , or @xmath15 , or @xmath93 .",
    "we recall in this connection that , for inelastic diffractive scattering processes in hadron - hadron collisions , the quantity @xmath15 is approximately equal to @xmath93 , which is the momentum fraction carried by the struck colorless gluon - cluster with respect to the incident beam ( see fig.8 of part i for more details ; note however that @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 in fig.8 of part i correspond respectively to @xmath43 , @xmath95 and @xmath97 in the discussions here . ) .",
    "hence , we shall write hereafter @xmath98 or @xmath99 instead of the general expression @xmath92 . this , together with eq.(3@xmath58 ) , leads to the corresponding scattering amplitude @xmath100 , and thus to the corresponding double differential cross - section @xmath101 , in terms of the variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the kinematical region : @xmath104 .",
    "for the determination of @xmath99 , it is of considerable importance to recall the following space - time properties of the color - singlet gluon - clusters which are btw - avalanches due to soc :    \\(i ) soc dictates , that there are btw - avalanches of all sizes ( which we denote by different @xmath105 values ) , and that the probability amplitude of finding an avalanche of size @xmath105 can be obtained from the size - distribution @xmath106 where the experimental results presented in part i show : @xmath107 .",
    "this means , @xmath108 contributes a factor @xmath109 , thus a factor @xmath110 to the scattering amplitude @xmath99 . here , as well as in ( ii ) , we take into account ( see sections 4 and 5 of part i for details ) that the size @xmath105 of a colorless gluon - cluster is directly proportional to the total amount of the energy the cluster carries ; the amount of energy is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the total energy of the proton , and @xmath93 is the energy fraction carried by the cluster .",
    "\\(ii ) qcd implies@xcite that the interactions between two arbitrarily chosen colored constituents of a btw - avalanche ( which is a colorless gluon cluster ) is stronger than those between two color - singlet btw - avalanches , because the latter should be interactions of van der waals type .",
    "this means , the struck avalanche can unify with the beam - particle ( maybe by absorbing each other ) , and viewed from any lorentz frame in which the beam - particle has a larger momentum than that of the colorless gluon - cluster , the latter is `` carried away '' by the beam particle .",
    "geometrically , the chance for the beam - particle to hit an avalanche of size @xmath105 ( on the plane perpendicular to the incident axis ) is proportional to the area that can be struck by the ( c.m.s . ) of the beam particle .",
    "the area is the @xmath113-power of the volume @xmath105 , @xmath114 , and thus it is proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "\\(iii ) based on the above - mentioned picture in which the btw - avalanches propagate isotropically from @xmath90 , the relative number - densities at different @xmath44-values can be readily evaluated . since for a given @xmath44 ,",
    "the distance in space between @xmath90 and @xmath116 is simply @xmath117 , the number of avalanches which pass a unit area on the shell of radius @xmath117 centered at @xmath90 is proportional to @xmath118 , provided that ( because of causality ) the lifetimes ( @xmath119 s ) of these avalanches are not shorter than @xmath120 .",
    "the latter is the time interval for an avalanche to travel from @xmath90 to @xmath86 .",
    "this means , because of the space - time properties of such avalanches it is of considerable importance to note : first , only avalanches having lifetimes @xmath121 can contribute to such a collision event .",
    "second , during the propagation from @xmath90 to @xmath86 , the motion of such an avalanche has to be considered as brownian . in fact , the continual , and more or less random , impacts received from the neighboring objects on its path leads us to the well known @xcite result that the time elapsed is proportional to the mean - square displacement .",
    "that is : @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , we recall that avalanches are due to soc , and thus the chance for an avalanche of lifetime @xmath119 to exist is @xmath123 where the experimental value@xcite for @xmath124 is @xmath125 .",
    "hence , by integrating @xmath126 over @xmath119 from @xmath120 to infinity , we obtain the fraction associated with all those whose lifetimes satisfy @xmath127 : this fraction is @xmath128 , and thus a constant times @xmath118",
    ".    the amplitude @xmath99 can now be obtained from the probability amplitude for avalanche - creation mentioned in ( i ) , by taking the weighting factors mentioned in ( ii ) and ( iii ) into account , and by integrating over @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the result is : @xmath129 by inserting this probability amplitude in impact - parameter - space , for the beam particle to encounter colorless gluon - clusters ( avalanches in the btw - theory ) which carries a fraction @xmath93 of the proton s total energy , in eq.(3 ) [ which is eq.(3 ) with the folowing replacements : @xmath55 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 we obtain the corresponding probability amplitude @xmath132 in momentum - space : @xmath133 where @xmath134 ( in the small @xmath93-region , @xmath135 , say ) is the corresponding momentum - transfer .",
    "the integration can be carried out analytically@xcite , and the result is @xmath136 hence , the corresponding double differential cross - section @xmath137 can approximately be written as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is an unknown normalization constant . because of the kinematical relationship @xmath103 for single diffractive scattering in proton - proton and proton - antiproton collisions ( see fig.8 of part i for more details ) , this can be , and should be , compared with the measured double differential cross - sections @xmath4 at different @xmath0- and @xmath17-values and for different missing masses @xmath2 in the region @xmath140 where @xmath141 is approximately @xmath142 .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig.1 . here , we made use of the fact that @xmath88 , where @xmath82 is the proton radius , and calculated @xmath143 by setting @xmath144 to be the well - known @xcite mean square proton charge radius , the value of which is @xmath145 .",
    "the result we obtained is : @xmath146 .",
    "the unknown normalization constant is determined by inserting this calculated value for @xmath143 in eq.(7 ) , and by comparing the right - hand - side of this equation with the @xmath4 data taken at @xmath147 .",
    "the value is @xmath148 .",
    "all the curves shown in fig.1 are obtained by inserting these values for @xmath143 and @xmath139 in eq.(7 ) .",
    "while the quality of the obtained result , namely the expression given on the right - hand - side of eq.(7 ) together with the above - mentioned values for @xmath143 and @xmath139 , can be readily judged by comparing it with the data , or by counting the unknown parameters , or both , it seems worthwhile to recall the following : the two basic ingredients of the proposed picture which have been used to derive this simple analytical expression are : first , the well - known optical analogy , and second , the properties of the dynamical scattering system .",
    "the latter is what we have learned through the data - analysis presented in part i of this paper .",
    "based on the theoretical arguments and experimental indications for the observation ( see ref.[[socletter ] ] and part i of this paper for details ) that the characteristic features of inelastic diffractive scattering processes are approximately independent of the incident energy and independent of the quantum - numbers of the beam - particles , the following results are expected : the explicit formula for the double differential cross - section as shown in eq.(7 ) should also be valid for the reactions @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "while the normalization constant @xmath139 ( which should in particular depend on the geometry of the beam particle ) is expected to be different for different reactions , everything else  especially the `` slope '' as well as the power of @xmath93 should be exactly the same as in @xmath22- and @xmath151-collisions . in this sense ,",
    "eq.(7 ) with @xmath152 ( @xmath153 is the proton radius ) is our prediction for @xmath154 and @xmath155 which can be measured at hera .    furthermore , in order to obtain the integrated differential cross - section @xmath5 , which has also been measured for different reactions at different incident energies , we only need to sum / integrate over @xmath93 in the given kinematic range ( @xmath135 , say ) .",
    "the result is @xmath156 where @xmath157 is an unknown normalization constant .",
    "while this observation has already been briefly discussed in a previous note @xcite , we now show the result of a further test of its universality : in fig .",
    "2 , we plot @xmath158 \\mbox { vs. } t\\ ] ] _ for different reactions at different incident energies _ in the range @xmath159@xmath160@xmath10@xmath11@xmath161 . here",
    "we see in particular that , measurements of @xmath5 for @xmath162 and @xmath163 reactions at larger @xmath11-values would be very useful .",
    "based on the characteristic properties of the gluons  in particular the local gluon - gluon coupling prescribed by the qcd - lagrangian , the confinement , and the non - conservation of gluon - numbers , we suggest that a system of interacting soft gluons should be considered as an open dynamical complex system which is in general far away from equilibrium . taken together with the observations made by bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw ) @xcite , we are led to the conclusion@xcite , that self - organized criticality ( soc ) and thus btw - avalanches exist in such systems , and that such avalanches manifest themselves in form of color - singlet gluon - clusters in inelastic diffractive scattering processes .    in order to test this proposal",
    ", we performed a systematic data - analysis , the result of which is presented in part i of this paper : it is shown that the size - distributions , and the lifetime - distributions , of such gluon - clusters _ indeed _ exhibit power - law behaviors which are known as the fingerprints of soc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is found that such exponents are approximately the same for different reactions at different incident energies  indicating the expected universality and robustness of soc .",
    "hence , the following picture emerges : for the beam particle ( which may be a virtual photon , or a real photon , or a proton , or an antiproton ; see fig.8 in part i for more details ) in an inelastic diffractive scattering process off proton ( one may wish to view this from a `` fast moving frame '' such as the c.m.s",
    ". frame ) , the target proton appears as a cloud of colorless gluon - clusters which exist inside and outside the confinement region of the proton .",
    "the size ( s ) distribution @xmath108 and the lifetime distribution @xmath164 can be expressed as @xmath165 and @xmath166 respectively , where the empirical values for @xmath167 and @xmath124 are @xmath167@xmath168@xmath124@xmath168@xmath169 , independent of the incident energy , and independent of the quantum numbers of the beam particles .",
    "what do we learn from this ?",
    "is this knowledge helpful in understanding hadronic structure and/or hadronic reactions in particle physics ?",
    "in particular , can this knowledge be used to do _ quantitative _ calculations  especially those , the results of which could _ not _ be achieved otherwise ?    in order to demonstrate how the obtained knowledge can be used to relate hadron - structure and hadronic reactions in general , and to perform quantitative calculations in particular , we discuss the following question  a question which has been with the high - energy physics community for many years :",
    "`` can the measured double differential cross section @xmath4 for inelastic diffractive scattering in proton - proton and in antiproton - proton collisions , in the kinematical region given by @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath10 @xmath12 , @xmath13@xmath10@xmath3@xmath10 @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xmath10@xmath16 , be understood in terms of optical geometrical concepts ? ''    the answer to this question is `` yes ! '' , and the details are presented in sections [ sec:2 ] , [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] of part ii where the following are explicitly shown : the characteristic features of the existing @xmath4-data are very much the same as those in optical diffraction , provided that the high - energy beams are considered as high - frequency waves , and the scatterer is a system of colorless gluon - clusters described in part i of this paper . further measurements of double differential cross sections , especially in @xmath162- and @xmath163-reactions , will be helpful in testing the ideas presented here .",
