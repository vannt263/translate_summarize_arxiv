    "circle graph_.    the idea of interlacement is almost 100 years old , as it was used by brahana in defining his separation matrix @xcite .",
    "interlacement graphs were first discussed by zelinka @xcite , who credited the idea to kotzig . but circle graphs did not become well known until the 1970s , when cohn and lempel @xcite and even and itai @xcite used them to analyze permutations , and bouchet @xcite and read and rosenstiehl @xcite used them to study gauss problem of characterizing generic self - intersecting curves in the plane .",
    "circle graphs were studied intensively during the next few decades . among the notable results of this intensive study are polynomial - time recognition algorithms due to bouchet @xcite , gioan , paul , tedder and corneil @xcite , naji @xcite and spinrad @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "interest in 4-regular graphs ( and indirectly on circle graphs ) has also focused on their appearance as medials of graphs imbedded on surfaces  @xcite .",
    "see figure [ circmf8 ] for an example .",
    "on the left is a 4-regular graph , with an indicated euler circuit . to trace",
    "the euler circuit just walk along the edges , making sure to preserve the dash style ( dashed or plain ) when traversing a vertex ; the dash style will sometimes change in the middle of an edge , though . on the right is the resulting interlacement graph .",

    "the @xmath12-transformations were introduced by kotzig @xcite , who proved the fundamental theorem that any two euler systems of @xmath0 are connected through some finite sequence of @xmath9-transformations . as noted by read and rosenstiehl @xcite , the interlacement graph @xmath13 is the _ simple local complement _",
    "@xmath14 , the simple graph obtained from @xmath2 by reversing all adjacencies among neighbors of @xmath11 .",

    "vertex - minor _ of @xmath15 .",
    "we use the subscript @xmath16 to distinguish simple local complementation from a closely related operation @xmath17 on looped simple graphs , which we call _ non - simple _ local complementation .",
    "this operation reverses the adjacencies between every pair of vertices in the open neighborhood @xmath18 and complements the loop status of every vertex in @xmath18 . looped simple graphs that can be obtained from each other through non - simple local complementations and loop complementations are said to be locally equivalent .",
    "in particular , @xmath15 is a circle graph if and only if every graph obtained from @xmath15 using loop complementations is also a circle graph ; consequently loops are irrelevant to characterizations of circle graphs , and most results regarding circle graphs are stated for simple graphs .",

    "we refer to this famous result as _",
    "bouchet s theorem_. bouchet s theorem resembles several well - known forbidden minors characterizations of matroid classes : for instance a matroid is binary iff @xmath19 is not a minor , a binary matroid is regular iff neither @xmath20 nor @xmath21 is a minor , and a regular matroid is graphic iff neither @xmath22 nor @xmath23 is a minor . but",
    "bouchet s theorem involves induced subgraphs rather than matroid minors , and including local equivalence makes bouchet s theorem seem more complicated than the classic matroid results .",
    "the present paper was initially motivated by a couple of questions suggested by this resemblance : can bouchet s theorem be rephrased to characterize circle graphs using matroids ? if so , is it possible to state such a characterization without mentioning local equivalence ?",
    "it turns out that both answers are `` yes '' ; we present several such characterizations below . in the process of explaining them we also obtain other circle graph characterizations , some of which involve local equivalence and",
    "do not explicitly mention matroids .",
    "[ ptb ]    circmf4.pdf    to state these characterizations , we introduce some terminology .",
    "first , we note that we follow the convention that if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are finite sets then an @xmath26 matrix has rows indexed by elements of @xmath24 and columns indexed by elements of @xmath25 .",

    "notation for the columns of @xmath32 follows this scheme : the @xmath11 column of @xmath29 is designated @xmath36 , the @xmath11 column of @xmath37 is designated @xmath38 , and the @xmath11 column of @xmath39 is designated @xmath40 .",
    "the set @xmath41 is denoted @xmath42 , and the binary matroid on @xmath42 represented by @xmath32 is the _ isotropic matroid _ of @xmath15 , _ _",

    "if @xmath44 then the subset @xmath45 of @xmath42 is the _ vertex triple _ corresponding to @xmath11 .",
    "notice that the three columns of @xmath32 corresponding to a vertex triple sum to @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath11 is not isolated then each of these columns has a nonzero entry , so the vertex triple is a circuit of @xmath43 $ ] . if @xmath11 is isolated , instead , then @xmath47 and @xmath48 are separate circuits of @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "a _ transversal _ of @xmath42 is a subset that includes precisely one element of each vertex triple , and a subset of a transversal is a _",

    "( we use `` transverse matroid '' to avoid confusion with transversal matroids . )",
    "a _ transverse circuit _ of @xmath15 is a circuit of a transverse matroid of @xmath15 .",
    "the  general theory of isotropic matroids is presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "part of this theory is the following result :    [ theory](@xcite ) let @xmath15 and @xmath49 be simple graphs . then any one of the following conditions implies the others :    1 .",

    "4 .   there is a bijection between @xmath42 and @xmath50 , under which vertex triples and transverse circuits of @xmath15 and @xmath49 correspond .    in particular , if @xmath15 and @xmath49 are locally equivalent then each sequence of local complementations that may be used to obtain @xmath49 from @xmath15 yields an _ induced isomorphism _",

    ".    all the interlacement graphs of euler systems of a particular 4-regular graph @xmath0 are locally equivalent ( up to isomorphism ) ; it follows that the class of circle graphs is closed under local complementation .",
    "theorem [ theory ] then implies that there must be matroidal characterizations of circle graphs using their isotropic matroids , their transverse circuits and their transverse matroids .",
    "circle graph characterizations involving isotropic matroids are complicated by the fact that the class of isotropic matroids is not closed under matroid minors .",
    "( the order of an isotropic matroid is divisible by 3 , so deleting or contracting an element of an isotropic matroid can not yield another isotropic matroid . ) in order to derive such characterizations we need a special minor operation that is appropriate for isotropic matroids .",
