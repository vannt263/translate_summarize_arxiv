    "one of the key questions in galaxy evolution is the epoch of the assembling of the hubble types . how and when do galaxies acquire their shape ? are ellipticals assembled in a monolithic collapse in the early universe or do they form from subunits as predicted in the hierarchical clustering scenario ? in the latter scenario stars are formed continuously over a wide range of redshift and galaxies are assembled via many generations of mergers of smaller subunits ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 , kauffmann et al .",
    "this prediction is strongly supported by the compilation of the cosmic star formation history ( a.k.a .",
    "madau plot ) where no particular epoch of star formation is seen ( madau et al .",
    "1996 , blain 2001 ) .",
    "this has frequently been used against the monolithic collapse theory which predicts rapid star formation at very high redshift ( z@xmath12 ) followed by a steep decline in the star formation rates ( eggen et al .",
    "1962 ; jimenez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , in the madau plot , the @xmath2@xmath3 at a given redshift could be either due to massive galaxies experiencing modest bursts of star formation or newly formed dwarf galaxies .",
    "the distinction between these two types of galaxies is the main difference between the two models .",
    "one way to decide between the models is to search for their predictions .",
    "it is our goal to construct a database of galaxies at intermediate-_z _ which will illustrate the galaxy population at that particular epoch .",
    "therefore our database will be useful when searching for the predicted types of galaxies at intermediate-_z_.",
    ".survey properties and results [ cols= \" < , > , < , > \" , ]     we are using archive hst / stis images obtained in parallel mode ( pi baum , i d 8549 ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and the clear filter properties .",
    "the great advantages of these data are the high resolution and the fact that the fields were randomly selected and were not particularly biased towards any environment .",
    "the exposure times were selected by the project that was executed when stis was pointing in parallel .",
    "we used only the fields that have high signal - to - noise and selected as extended sources all objects which were 2 @xmath4 the stellar point spread function .",
    "we measured sizes down to 1 @xmath5 of the sky level .",
    "based on visual inspection for morphology classification a limiting magnitude of 23.5 was chosen .",
    "we used an area of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) north observed with stis to compare the clear magnitudes with magnitudes obtained with wfpc2 .",
    "we found that clear magnitudes are 1.053 magnitudes fainter than hdf magnitudes ( de mello & pasquali 2001 ) of the same galaxies . from the slitless spectra",
    "we have determined the redshifts of several objects in our sample .",
    "typical cases at z=@xmath6 are described in pasquali & de mello ( 2002 ) .",
    "we have identified 290 galaxies brighter than the limiting magnitude and visually classified each galaxy according to their morphology .",
    "we used two qualifiers : early - type / late - type and disk / no disk / irregular .",
    "first the galaxy was assigned either early - type or late - type .",
    "then it was searched for the presence of a disk and assigned disk / no disk / irregular .",
    "the transition classes s / irr and irr / s reflect the strength of spiral feature .",
    "galaxies which were peculiars ( irregular ) but had some sign of spiral arms were classified as irr / s .",
    "a seventh class was assigned to galaxies which had strong signs of past interaction , mergers .",
    "fig.1 shows a gallery of morphological types selected to illustrate typical galaxies of our survey and table 1 summarizes the results .",
    "we found that 40% of our sample is made of early type galaxies ( e and s0 ) which is higher than what is found in the local universe ( 22% ) and in the hubble deep field at intermediate-_z _",
    "( 11% , van den bergh et al . 2000 ) . this could be a sign of evolutionary effect and/or to the fact that the hdf sample is too small ( only 50 objects at z=0.25 - 0.6 ) . in order to check whether there is any evolutionary effect in our sample",
    "we have divided the sample according to magnitude intervals ( fig.2 ) .",
    "we found that there are : ( i ) more irregulars and ellipticals at fainter magnitudes , ( ii ) spirals and s0s in all magnitudes , and ( iii ) mergers only at fainter magnitudes ."
