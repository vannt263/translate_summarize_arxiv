    "it is a general fact of electrodynamics in continuous media that matter acts as a sort of potential for light : the dielectric constant in maxwell equations plays in fact a role mathematically equivalent to the external potential in the schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , remarkable features appear for light propagation through a system with a periodic modulation of the dielectric properties on the scale of the radiation wavelength @xcite : in analogy with electron propagation in crystalline solids , these structures are then called _ photonic crystals _ ( pcs ) . according to the floquet - bloch theorem , the discrete translational symmetry garantees in fact the conservation of the bloch wave vector in the first brillouin zone , the spatial periodicity of the eigenfunctions in the elementary cell , and the separation of the energy spectrum in bands and forbidden gaps  @xcite .",
    "depending on the frequency dependence of the dieletric response of the material , pcs are generally classified into two broad categories : passive , if the underlying media are dispersionless , and resonant  @xcite .",
    "an interesting example of resonant pc can be realized using ultracold alkali atoms trapped in the periodic potential of an optical lattice  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a mile - stone in this field has consisted of the achievement of a mott insulator ( mi ) phase @xcite , in which an integer and constant number of atoms are trapped at each site of the periodic optical potential formed by the interference pattern of several laser beams . if temperature is low enough , atoms are frozen in the lowest vibrational level of each well and the system periodicity is extremely regular : almost no impurities are in fact present ( i.e. missing or extra atoms ) , and there are no phonons .",
    "thanks to the simple level structure of alkali atoms , one can selectively address specific transitions , so to realize e.g. two or three - level models . from this point of view",
    ", the mi can be seen as an extremely resonant pc , where the bragg scattering processes due to the periodic arrangement of atoms have a strong interplay with the atomic optical resonances .",
    "the cleanness of the system , and the weakness of spurious non - radiative effects guarantees that coherence can be preserved for very long times during radiation - matter interaction .",
    "this is crucial to manipulate the photon propagation without losing its coherence .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a general and fully quantum theory to describe the radiation - matter interaction in these systems .",
    "although the model is perfectly general , we specialize our analysis to the 1d case with normally incident light .",
    "both a two - level and a three - level @xmath0 configurations are considered .",
    "the band dispersion is characterized as a function of the relative position of the atomic resonance and the bragg frequency corresponding to the lattice periodicity .",
    "two main regimes are identified depending on whether the two frequency scales are close or well separated .",
    "the band dispersion is then used in a calculation of the reflection spectra for both semi - infinite and finite systems .",
    "these results are the starting point to propose a _",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : hopf ] , we review the hopfield approach to radiation - matter interaction and its application to the case of a lattice of two - level atoms . in sec.[sec:1dbandr ] , the hopfield formalism is applied to get predictions for the dispersion of the elementary excitations of the system , the so - called polaritons .",
    "reflection spectra for semi - infinite and finite 1d systems are presented . in sec.[sec:1d3level ] we extend the model to the case of three - level atoms in a @xmath0 level configuration : we implement the dressed atom approach into the hopfield hamiltonian and we obtain predictions for the polariton dispersion and reflection spectra . in sec.[sec : lifter ] , the application of three - level atomic systems as photon energy lifter is discussed for realistic parameters of rb systems .",

    "we consider the interaction between light and a collection of two - level atoms trapped in the periodic potential of an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the atoms are assumed to be in a perfect mott insulator state where one and only one atom is present at each lattice site @xcite . with a suitable choice of the lattice laser frequency and polarization",
    ", the minima of the optical potential felt by the different atomic states can be made to coincide and to form a cubic lattice of spacing @xmath1 .",
    "provided trapping at each site is tight enough , the atomic center - of - mass motion results frozen in the motional ground state around the potential minimum ( lamb - dicke regime ) and no atomic tunneling is allowed between adjacent sites .",
    "the energies of the ground @xmath2 and excited @xmath3 states of the atom have therefore to include the light shift due to the optical potential as well as the zero - point kinetic energy : the resulting energy separation is indicated by @xmath4 .    single - atom excitations on the @xmath5 atom are respectively destroyed and created by the operators @xmath6 @xcite . to take the most advantage of the translational symmetry of the lattice , one can construct creation operators for delocalized excitations with a well - defined bloch wave vector @xmath7 : @xmath8 an integration box of size @xmath9 is assumed with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "an example of polaritonic dispersion for this regime is shown in fig.[fig : exc ] for @xmath72 .",
    "for the sake of clarity , a somehow exaggerated value of @xmath39 has been used in the figure .",
    "on one hand , the exciton and a single photonic mode intersect in the interior of the fbz ; their mixing results in an anticrossing of the polariton modes with a rabi splitting equal to @xmath73 .",
    "far from this region , the polaritonic modes tend to almost purely photon and exciton modes .",
    "on the other hand , pair of photon modes intersect at the edge of the fbz at frequencies multiple of @xmath70 ; their mixing is due to bragg scattering processes on the atomic lattice .",
    "gaps open at the edges of the fbz : the lower one ( around @xmath19 ) is the usual polaritonic gap of resonant dielectrics @xcite , while the upper one ( just above @xmath70 ) is due to bragg scattering processes .",
    "differently from the bulk case , the former gap extends on both sides of @xmath19 because of the limited size of the fbz .",
    "the latter one is instead located strictly above @xmath70 .",
    "its lower edge is exactly at @xmath70 and corresponds to a purely photonic state , unaffected by the presence of the atoms which are located at the electric field nodes . as usual",
    ", the polaritonic density of states vanishes inside the gaps , and radiative propagation at these frequencies is forbidden .    from a formal point of view",
    ", the lower gap mainly originates from the exciton - photon coupling , while the upper one contains a contribution from the direct photon - photon coupling as well .",
    "as @xmath74 , all these terms are of the same order . this picture is preserved in 2d and 3d , as all other photonic modes that may participate are far away in energy .    the other regime ,",
    "let s call it _",
    "mixed exciton - bragg _ regime , is characterized by the condition @xmath75 . in this case",
    "three modes are simultaneously mixed , namely two photon branches ( the incoming one at @xmath76 and the first bragg diffracted at @xmath77 ) and the excitonic state . differently from the previous case , the splittings ( again of the order of @xmath69 )",
    "are now located close to the edges of the fbz .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : excbragg ] , this results in much wider forbidden gaps of the order of the splitting .",
    "in addition to this , the `` central '' band between @xmath19 and @xmath70 results squeezed and shows a very flat dispersion over most of the fbz .    in the mixing region around the band edge ,",
    "the upper and lower polaritons are mixture of exciton and photons with almost equal weights , while the central polariton band at @xmath70 is mostly photonic .",
    "this effect is easily explained in terms of the electric field showing nodes at the atomic locations , as in the previous regime .",
    "the band dispersion introduced in the previous section is a complete description of the photon propagation inside the lattice .",
    "most spectroscopic experiments , however , involve light beams which are incident onto finite systems and therefore require a description of the interfaces between regions of different optical properties , namely the external vacuum and the atomic lattice .",
    "this allows to calculate crucial properties of the system , such as its reflectivity  @xcite .",
    "this can be done by imposing suitable boundary conditions on the electromagnetic fields : maxwell theory imposes in fact the continuity of both the electric field and its spatial derivative . in the following",
    ", we shall restrict to the most relevant case of a coherent , monochromatic excitation at @xmath78 .",

    "the mismatch between the photonic components of the polariton state and the incoming wave determines the reflectivity @xmath93 shown in the figures : this is significant around the gaps where the incoming wave is strongly mixed with either an exciton [ around the lower gap in fig.[fig : rsemiinfexc ] ] , a photon [ around the upper gap in fig.[fig : rsemiinfexc ] ] , or both [ around both gaps of fig.[fig : rsemiinfexcbragg ] ] . in the mixed exciton - bragg regime ,",
    "note that the reflectivity remains quite large in between the two gaps : the flatter the middle - polariton branch , the higher the corresponding reflectivity . in the present semi - infinite geometry , reflectivity is complete inside the gaps where the wave vector becomes imaginary and the field inside the lattice consists of an evanescent wave .",
    "the _ output _ problem corresponds to two counterpropagating bloch modes with the same energy inside the lattice and a single transmitted plane wave in the external vacuum .",
    "in this situation , the reflectivity is given by @xmath94 with @xmath95 where the @xmath96 and @xmath97 signs refer to the propagation versa of the polaritons .",
    "the system being invariant under time reversal and spatial parity , it is easy to prove that the coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath99 entering in the formula ( [ eq : polaritonfield ] ) for polariton field share the same phase and can be chosen to be all real .",
    "the electric fields of counterpropagating polaritons are therefore complex conjugates of each other @xmath100 . plugging this into ( [ eq : rout ] ) and comparing the result with ( [ eq : rin ] ) , it is immediate to see that @xmath101 .",

    "note that the present approach is not able to calculate the reflectivity inside the gaps where the field consists of an evanescent wave .",
    "the main difference with respect to the semi - infinite case is the presence of fast oscillations on top of the reflectivity spectrum around the main gaps .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "two interfaces at respectively @xmath102 and @xmath103 now separate three regions of space : the vacuum with the incident and reflected photons , the finite - size lattice with counterpropagating polaritons , and again vacuum with now only a transmitted photon .",

    "the nucleus is not affected by the optical process and maintains the same polarization it had in the initial state : in the absolute atomic ground state , the nuclear spin is e.g. polarized antiparallel to the electron spin of the @xmath177 state .",
    "a @xmath162 polarization is used for the dressing light beam that couples the @xmath178 and the @xmath174 states , and a @xmath179 one is used to probe the polariton dispersion on the @xmath180 transition .",
    "using tabulated values for the electric dipole moment of the @xmath163 transition , the exciton - photon coupling ( [ eq : exphcoupling ] ) for the system under consideration is of the order of @xmath181 .    to maximize the available time to perform the lifter operation",
    ", it is useful to have a very slow group velocity , which in turns requires a small dressing amplitude . in the following",
    ", we shall choose @xmath182 .",
    "this value @xmath183 corresponds to @xmath184 times the radiative linewidth of the @xmath185 line of rb atoms .",
    "the dressing frequency is chosen in a way to have @xmath138 at the initial value @xmath186 of the magnetic field : the corresponding polariton dispersion is the one shown in fig.[fig : lifter](a ) .",
    "the light pulse is injected into the system in proximity of the resonant point @xmath153 , where the interface reflectivity goes to zero , and injection is most effective ( see the circle in fig.[fig : lifter](a ) ) : the width of this dip results from ( [ eq : refdip ] ) to be of the order of @xmath187 and the group velocity ( [ eq : vgr ] ) is @xmath188 , i.e. @xmath189 .    the magnetic field variation is performed while the light pulse to be shifted is completely contained in the lattice and is propagating through an effectively bulk system . as the magnetic field",
    "is varied in a spatially homogeneous way , the bloch wave vector is conserved during the process . if the field variation is slow enough as compared to the frequency difference of neighbouring bands , the polaritons will adiabatically follow the band and their frequency at the end of the process will be accordingly shifted ( see the circle in fig.[fig : lifter](d ) ) .",
    "as an example , we propose to tune the magnetic field from @xmath190 up to @xmath191 t : this results in the metastable and excited states being shifted by respectively @xmath192 and @xmath193 with respect to the ground state . for light",
    "initially injected in proximity of @xmath194 , the shift of the photon frequency results approximately equal to @xmath195 , which amounts to the quite sizeable value @xmath196 .",
    "as the lifter operation is based on an adiabatic shift of the polariton dispersion , it completely preserves the pulse shape and the coherence properties of the incident wavepacket , both at classical and at quantum level .",
    "to verify the actual feasibility of such a promising experiment , it is important to mention the main practical difficulties that may arise in an actual experiment , and discuss how these can be overcome .    1 .",
    "we have verified that the transmittivity of the lattice interfaces is close to @xmath190 for both the injection and the extraction process ( figs.[fig : lifter](b , e ) ) .",
    "the pulse is injected into the lattice at a frequency corresponding to the eit reflectivity dip around raman resonance .",
    "the extraction takes place in close proximity of the raman resonance where reflectivity is again very low .",
    "this , in spite of the fact we are very close to a gap : thanks to the now significant detuning @xmath197 , the metastable state is in fact weakly coupled to light , and the corresponding crossing point is displaced slightly away from the light line . 2 .   in order to have a reasonably long time to vary the magnetic field ,",
    "we have verified that the group velocity of the polariton states involved in the lifter operation is slow .",
    "light initially propagates on the eit slow light branch , which is deformed during the lifter operation . at the end",
    ", the wavepacket is found on the very flat region below the gap where the group velocity is low .",
    "the wavepacket has to be shorter than the lattice length , still its frequency spectrum has to fit in the reflectivity dip at both injection and extraction .",
    "a lattice of @xmath198 cells is able to accomodate pulses with at most @xmath199 . from panel",
    "( a ) , this corresponds to a lower bound on the frequency width of the incoming wavepacket @xmath200 .",
    "one can easily see in panel ( b ) that this frequency spread still fits within the injection window where reflectivity is low .",
    "the same can be verified on panels ( d - e ) for the extraction process .",
    "4 .   in order for the pulse shape not to be affected , dispersion of the group velocity should be small for the wavevector window @xmath201 under examination .",
    "initially , this is not a problem , as we are working close to the center of the eit branch where the group velocity has a weak dispersion",
    ". the situation can be more critical on extraction , because of the strong squeezing of the polariton band in the region just below the gap .",
    "the importance of this effect can be reduced by choosing pulses initially tuned just above the raman resonance .    one major constraint that still exists on the experimental parameters concerns the speed at which the magnetic field has to be actually varied .",
    "as this has to be done while the wavepacket is inside the lattice , a very slow group velocity and a long lattice are required .",
    "using values for state - of - the - art mis .",
    "namely @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , one obtains that one disposes of a time of approximately @xmath204 to perform the magnetic field variation .",
    "this means that a variation of @xmath205 requires a very large rate of @xmath206 .    as this can pose serious difficulties in an actual experiment",
    ", it is worth briefly exploring alternative strategies .",
    "an interesting possibility is to further reduce the dressing amplitude @xmath129 .",
    "as the polariton group velocity is proportional to the square of the dressing amplitude , the value @xmath207 used in a recent slow light experiment  @xcite already leads to a group velocity of the order of @xmath208 which corresponds to an available time of @xmath209 . in the high - field regime considered here",
    ", a photon frequency shift of @xmath210 then requires a magnetic field variation of @xmath211 in @xmath209 , a rate routinely used in cold atom experiments .",
    "it is important to note that the reduction of the dressing amplitude implies a squeezing of the reflectivity dip at injection and an enhancement of the dispersion at extraction .",
    "these , apparently serious problems are overcome thanks to the fact that a reduction in the group velocity implies a spatial shortening of the pulse in the lattice , and therefore a reduced frequency spread for a given length .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a fully quantum description of radiation - matter interaction in a gas of ultracold atoms trapped in the mott insulator phase of an optical lattice .",
    "the coherent interaction between photons and atomic excitations gives rise to new , mixed polaritonic excitations .    in the case of two - level atoms ,",
    "two different regimes are identified . in the purely excitonic regime , where the atomic resonance is far from the bragg frequency of the lattice ,",
    "two gaps appear in the energy spectrum . in the mixed exciton - bragg regime ,",
    "the interplay of the atomic resonance and the lattice periodicity enhances the gap amplitudes and gives rise to a flat band between them .",
    "the consequences of the polariton dispersion on the reflection properties of finite lattices have been investigated .",
    "the theory is then extended to a system of three - level atoms in a @xmath0 configuration . the slow - light band which joins weak reflection to ultra - slow group velocity turns out to be the most promising in view of applications as a photon lifter , i.e. a device able to shift the carrier frequency of an optical pulse without affecting its shape nor spoiling its coherence properties .",
    "advantages and disadvantages of using atomic gases as photon lifters are discussed .",
    "future work will address the application of slow as well as stopped polaritons as non - destructive probes of the microscopic properties of ultracold gases , e.g. the behaviour of matter wave coherence across the superfluid to mott insulator transition .",
