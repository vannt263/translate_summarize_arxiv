    "the last few years have seen a rapid growth in observations aimed at identifying intermediate- and high - mass star forming sites in a wide range of evolutionary stages ranging from `` hot cores '' ( cesaroni et al .",
    "@xcite ) , to ultracompact hii  ( uchii ) regions ( wood & churchwell  @xcite ) , to proto - ae / be stars ( hunter et al .",
    "the characterization of the earliest stages of high mass - star formation is more difficult than for low - mass objects , given their shorter evolutionary timescales .",
    "the likely candidates must be luminous , embedded in dense circumstellar environments , and non - associated with hii  regions ( c.f . habing & israel  @xcite )    we have undertaken a systematic study to identify a sample of massive protostellar candidates , selecting sources from the iras - psc2 catalogue and filtering them according to the above criteria .",
    "on the basis of h@xmath10o  maser ( palla et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ammonia lines ( molinari et al .",
    "@xcite ) , centimeter and submillimeter continuum observations ( molinari et al . @xcite ; @xcite ) , we were finally left with about a dozen candidates which may be precursors of uchii  regions .",
    "several of these sources have been recently observed with the iram-30 m telescope ( brand et al .",
    "1998 , in preparation ) and some with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , to characterize them over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "we are now beginning a program of high spatial resolution millimeter wave observations of these objects .",

    "] of 4.9  kpc ( using the brand & blitz  ( @xcite ) galactic rotation curve ) .",
    "according to the definition ( e.g. andr  @xcite ) , this is an excellent candidate of a high - mass counterpart of class 0 objects .",
    "it is associated with an h@xmath10o  maser and with nh@xmath26 line and submillimeter continuum emission , while no centimeter continuum emission was detected in our vla observations down to a level of @xmath27  mjy / beam .",
    "the field centered on iras23385@xmath236053 was observed at 88  ghz ( continuum and lines ) with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter wave array during january / february 1998 .",
    "two configurations of the six 10.4-m telescope antennas provided baselines in the range 15240  m. cryogenically cooled sis receivers have typical average system temperature of @xmath28  k. the continuum observations used two 1  ghz wide bands of an analog correlator . for the line observations ,",
    "the digital correlator was split into several bands , enabling simultaneous observations of the hco@xmath2(@xmath3 )  and h@xmath4co@xmath2(@xmath3 )  rotational lines with @xmath29 bandwidth and @xmath30 resolution ; the hco@xmath2(@xmath3 )  line was also observed with a @xmath31 bandwidth and @xmath32 resolution .",
    "additionally , data on the sio(v=0 , @xmath5 )  line were acquired in the image sideband of the hco@xmath2(@xmath3 )  line with the same bandwidths and resolutions .",
    "gain and phase were calibrated by means of frequent observations of the quasar 0224@xmath23671 .",
    "3c273 was used for passband calibration .",
    "the flux density scale was determined by observations of planets and the estimated uncertainty is less than 20% .",
    "the synthesized beamsize is @xmath33 .",
    "noise levels in the maps are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for the continuum and the low and high resolution spectral data , respectively .",
    "iso ( kessler et al .",
    "@xcite ) observations with cam ( cesarsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) were made in staring mode on june 18 1997 .",
    "diffraction - limited images ( resolution 2@xmath37.2 and 5@xmath37 , respectively ) were obtained in the two broad - band filters lw2 ( @xmath38=6.75@xmath6 m , @xmath39=3.5@xmath6 m ) and lw3 ( @xmath38=15.0@xmath6 m , @xmath39=6@xmath6 m ) .",
    "the pixel - field - of - view is 3@xmath37 , and the absolute pointing accuracy of the satellite was presumably within @xmath40@xmath37  at the time of the observations .",
    "more than 50 frames per filter were obtained with a 2s integration time per frame , and the expected 3@xmath9 sensitivity limits were 0.33 and 0.45 mjy / arcsec@xmath41 in lw2 and lw3 , respectively .",
    "the data have been reduced using cam interactive analysis ( v2.0 ) , and the absolute calibration is accurate within 20% .",
    "figure  [ plates]a shows the contour plot of the hco@xmath2(@xmath3 )  integrated line intensity overlaid on the cam - lw3 filter 15  @xmath6 m  image .",
    "figure  [ plates]b shows an enlargement of the central region , with a contour plot of the 3.4  mm continuum . with the exception of hco@xmath2(@xmath3 )  emission in one area to the ne , the hco@xmath2 line and the 3.4  mm continuum arise from the central region where the 15  @xmath42 continuum is faintest ; hco@xmath2 also shows an extension towards s - se .    in the dark region at the center of the 15  @xmath6 m  image , flux densities of the order of @xmath431  mjy / arcsec@xmath41 are found .",
    "similar values are also found in the southern portion of the cam field , suggesting that such a constant level is due to faint foreground diffuse emission .",
    "the @xmath44 noise computed in the southern 20@xmath37  of the image is @xmath430.15  mjy / arcsec@xmath41 .",
    "similar flux densities and @xmath44 levels are obtained for the 6.75  @xmath6 m  image .",
    "we thus conclude that no 15  @xmath6 m  source is detected at the position of the central 3.4  mm continuum peak down to a @xmath45 level of @xmath46  mjy / arcsec@xmath41 which , integrated over the deconvolved area of the 3.4  mm core , corresponds to @xmath47 mjy .",
    "the 3.4  mm continuum core is compact with slight elongations to the se and n ( fig .",
    "[ plates ] ) .",
    "the total integrated flux density is 19  mjy and the deconvolved source size is 4@xmath37.5@xmath483@xmath37.6 , corresponding to an average radius of 0.048  pc at a distance of 4.9  kpc .",
    "the continuum emission peaks at @xmath49@xmath37 , and is probably due solely to dust thermal emission since the extrapolation at 3.4  mm of the  2 cm upper limit with an ionized wind model @xmath50 ( panagia & felli  @xcite ) yields less than 10% of the observed flux density .    fig .",
    "[ sed ] shows the complete spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of iras23385 + 6053 .",
    "the ovro flux density is consistent with those from jcmt ( molinari et al .",
    "@xcite ) , indicating that no significant diffuse millimeter emission has been missed by the interferometer . on the other hand",
    "the iras flux densities include contributions of all the sources seen in the 15  @xmath6 m  image of fig .",
    "[ plates ] . indeed , the iras 12  @xmath6 m  and 25  @xmath6 m  points in fig .",
    "[ sed ] ( 5.05 and 17.8 jy , respectively ) are compatible with the cam 6.75 and 15 @xmath6 m  flux integrated over all the bright emission visible on the cam image ( @xmath434.8 and 9.3 jy respectively , in an area of 6.8@xmath51 sterad ) , while they lie more than 3 orders of magnitude above the cam flux density limits for the core estimated above .",
    "clearly , the 6.75 and 15  @xmath6 m  emission area , which is not directly related to the millimeter core , is responsible for the iras 12 and 25@xmath6 m  flux densities ; however , it is unlikely that it contributes for a significant fraction of the 60  @xmath6 m  and 100  @xmath6 m  iras flux densities because : 1 ) at millimeter wavelengths , the core is compact and no discrete or diffuse continuum emission is detected at either ovro or the jcmt ; 2 ) a power law extrapolation of the 6.75 , 12 , 15 and 25 @xmath6 m  flux densities to longer wavelengths , leads to flux densities at 60 and 100  @xmath6 m  @xmath18 10% of the observed values .",
    "we conclude that the millimeter core is the only source contributing significantly at 60 and 100  @xmath6 m . in fig .",
    "[ sed ] the dotted line is a fit to the data , obtained adopting a spherical envelope model where density and temperature vary according to radial power laws with exponents -0.5 and -0.4 respectively . the density and temperature at the external radius , which is the observed r@xmath52pc , are 7@xmath53@xmath54  and 40 k. the opacity is @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( preibisch et al .",
    "we compute the bolometric luminosity of the source by integrating the data with a power law interpolation scheme , excluding the iras 12 and 25  @xmath6 m  flux densities and using the cam upper limit at 15  @xmath6 m . at the adopted distance of 4.9  kpc ,",
    "we find l@xmath57  l@xmath1 .",
    "integrating the fitted density power law and adopting a gas to dust ratio of 100 by mass , we estimate a mass of @xmath43 370  m@xmath1  and a mean h@xmath10 column density of @xmath58  @xmath12 for the core ( corresponding to a visual extinction a@xmath59 ) .",
    "we also computed the mass of the core from hco@xmath2 line emission .",
    "the optical depth in each channel within 3 km  s@xmath22  of v@xmath60=@xmath6151 km  s@xmath22  was estimated from the hco@xmath2/h@xmath4co@xmath2 ratio , assuming a @xmath62c/@xmath4c@xmath63 abundance ratio using the galactic abundance gradient and the local - ism value given in wilson & rood  ( @xcite ) and a source galactocentric distance of @xmath64  kpc ; we find that the core of the main isotope line is optically thick .",
    "we derive a lower limit ( due to the optical depth ) for the h@xmath10 mass of 180 m@xmath1  assuming t@xmath65  k , based on the peak hco@xmath2(@xmath3 )  synthesized beam brightness temperature , and [ hco@xmath2]/[h@xmath10]@xmath68 .",
    "this value compares reasonably well with a virial mass of 160  m@xmath69 obtained from the line width ( @xmath70 ) and hco@xmath2(@xmath3 )  core radius ( @xmath71  pc ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fspec ] we present profiles of the sio(v=0 , @xmath5 )  and hco@xmath2(@xmath3 )  lines at low spectral resolution and the hco@xmath2(@xmath3 )  and h@xmath4co@xmath2(@xmath3 )  lines at higher resolution , integrated over the @xmath72  arcsec@xmath41 centered on the core peak .",
    "both the sio and the hco@xmath2 profiles show broad wings , while no wing emission is detected from h@xmath4co@xmath2(@xmath3 ) .",
    "images of the hco@xmath2 and sio emission integrated over the blue ( from @xmath6163 to @xmath6153  km  s@xmath22 ) and the red ( from @xmath6147 to @xmath6137  km  s@xmath22 ) wings are shown in fig .",
    "[ flobes ] . a compact outflow centered on the continuum source",
    "is detected ; both the blue and the red lobes are visible in sio(v=0 , @xmath5 ) , whereas only the blue lobe is clearly detected in hco@xmath2(@xmath3 ) , although a faint red lobe may be present .",
    "the lobes are barely resolved ; their position relative to each other , i.e. their degree of overlap , suggests that the inclination of its axis can be no more than 30@xmath73 with respect to the line of sight ( cabrit & bertout  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this orientation of the outflow rules out any possibility that the large extinction derived toward iras23385 + 6053 and the non - detection at 15 @xmath6 m  may result from geometrical effects ( e.g. an edge - on disk ) .",
    "properties of the iras23385 + 6053 outflow are listed in table  [ flowpar ] .",
    "column density , mass , momentum and energy are computed in each velocity channel and finally summed , while the dynamical timescale is averaged over the velocity channels .",
    "we estimated the column density of material assuming lte and optically thin approximations in all the line wings channels within the velocity ranges listed previously , assuming the above determined excitation temperature of 30  k for both hco@xmath2 and sio . for both molecules",
    "we adopt an abundance fraction of 10@xmath74 relative to h@xmath10 .",
    "the velocity measured in the lobes is a good estimate of the true gas velocity because the outflow axis is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the sky .",
    "this configuration prevents an accurate measure of lobe size , but a reasonable estimate can be made based on the non - detection at 15@xmath6 m . since any outflow more extended than the core would have created a cavity through which mid - infrared radiation could have escaped , we infer that the extent of the flow lobes is less than the core size .",
    "the size of the lobes and the dynamical time scale of the outflow are therefore upper limits , while the mass loss rate and kinetic luminosity are lower limits .    the flow mechanical power and mass loss rate in table  [ flowpar ] are high compared to values characterizing outflows powered by low - mass protostars ( e.g. fukui et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but in good agreement with those for high - mass young stellar objects ( shepherd & churchwell  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamical timescale is similar to values found for the youngest outflows around low - mass class 0 objects ( andr et al .",
    "iras23385 + 6053 was not detected at 6 and 2  cm with the vla b - array with 3@xmath9 sensitivity limits of @xmath430.5 and @xmath430.8 mjy / beam respectively ( molinari et al .",
    "@xcite ) , implying that any associated hii  region , if present , must be optically thick and very compact . in this latter case , from the vla synthesized beamsize and assuming that the source has not been detected because of beam dilution , the 2  cm upper limit leads to an upper limit for the radius of an optically thick , spherical and homogeneous hii  region @xmath75  au ( see also molinari et al .",
    "an hii  region originating from a b0 zams star ( which has a luminosity comparable to the bolometric luminosity of iras23385 + 6053 ) in a dense ( @xmath76  @xmath54 ) environment takes only few years to expand to a radius of 100 au ( de pree et al .",
    "however , a modest accretion rate of @xmath77  m@xmath1/yr could squelch the expanding hii  region ( see e.g. walmsley  @xcite ) , thus explaining the properties of our source in terms of a heavily obscured b0-zams with a residual accretion .",
    "another possible explanation is that there is no hii  region because iras23385 + 6053 has not yet reached the zams . in this case we assume that the observed bolometric luminosity is due to accretion onto a protostellar core with accretion luminosity expressed as l@xmath78 l@xmath1  ( m@xmath79/m@xmath1 ) ( r@xmath1/r@xmath79 ) ( @xmath80m@xmath1yr@xmath22 ) . since l@xmath81 is known , we can combine it with the mass - radius relation of stahler , palla & salpeter ( @xcite ) , r@xmath82 r@xmath1  ( m@xmath79/m@xmath1)@xmath83 ( @xmath84m@xmath1yr@xmath22)@xmath85 , to derive the protostellar mass m@xmath79 as a function of the accretion rate . for an accretion rate @xmath86 m@xmath1yr@xmath22 , which is expected if the outflow ( see table  [ flowpar ] ) is driven by infall ( e.g. shu et al . 1988 )",
    ", we obtain m@xmath79=39 m@xmath1 , implying that the embedded iras source is a massive protostar . in either case , this source is evidently massive and extremely young .",
    "based on the evidence presented here , _",
    "we propose iras23385 + 6053 as a prototype high - mass class  0 object _ : it is undetected in the mid - ir ( @xmath87@xmath6 m ) and in the radio continuum ; it has l@xmath14/l@xmath88 ( where l@xmath14 is obtained by integrating longward of 350@xmath6 m ) ; it has a ratio of the envelope to stellar mass greater than 1 ( see andr et al .",
    "@xcite ) , m@xmath16/m@xmath89 . the very short dynamical timescale ( @xmath187000 yrs ) of the associated compact molecular outflow is also compatible with values found for outflows around low - mass class 0 objects .    *",
