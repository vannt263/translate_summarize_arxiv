    "nonequilibrium statistical models with many degrees of freedom whose dynamics violate detailed balance arise in many areas such as biological populations , chemical reactions , fluid turbulence , traffic flow , and growth / deposition processes .",
    "the macroscopic behavior of these models can be much richer than that of systems in thermal equilibrium , showing organized macroscopic spatial and temporal structures like pulses or waves , and even spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "even the steady state behavior of a homogeneous system without these structures can be far more complicated , involving for example a scale invariant steady state without tuning the system to a specific point .",
    "however , like their equilibrium cousins , systems at continuous transitions between nonequilibrium steady states show universal behavior that is insensitive to microscopic details and depends only on properties such as symmetries and conservation laws .",
    "one class of models that have received extensive study are those with absorbing phase transitions where the system changes from an active state with statistical fluctuations about the mean behavior to a noiseless inert state consisting of a single microscopic configuration .",
    "the term absorbing refers to the fact that the system can not leave this state once it reaches it .",
    "examples include directed percolation ( dp)@xcite , the contact process@xcite , auto - catalytic reaction models@xcite , and branching annihilating random walks with odd numbers of offspring@xcite .",
    "both renormalization group calculations@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite show that these models form a single universality class for a purely nonequilibrium model with no internal symmetry in the order parameter .",
    "recently , a number of models with continuous adsorbing transitions in a universality class distinct from directed percolation have been studied .",
    "these models include probabilistic cellular automata models studied by grassberger and coworkers@xcite , certain kinetic ising models@xcite , the interacting monomer - dimer model@xcite , a three species monomer model with potts - like symmetry@xcite and branching annihilating random walks with an even number of offspring ( bawe)@xcite . all of these models except for the bawe have two equivalent absorbing states indicating the importance of symmetry of the adsorbing state to the universality class .",
    "however , the universal behavior of this new class is apparently controlled by a dynamical conservation law .",
    "if the important dynamical variables in this class are defects represented by the walkers in the bawe model and the walls between different saturated domains in the other models , the models have a `` defect parity '' conservation law@xcite where the number of defects is conserved modulo 2 .",
    "recent field theoretic work confirms this viewpoint@xcite .",
    "recently , two of us@xcite investigated a three - species monomer model with annihilation reactions between dissimilar species . the transitions from the reactive state to a single absorbing state where one species saturates the system fell in the dp universality class .",
    "these phase boundaries meet at bicritical points@xcite where two different absorbing states coexist .",
    "because the domain walls between different domains of the two phases spawn and annihilate in pairs , the critical behavior fell into the bawe universality class .",
    "we also showed that at the bicritical point the characteristic fluctuations of the domain walls between the equivalent absorbing phases was given by a new exponent .",
    "the present paper studies the connection between the behavior at a bicritical point and the presence of the bawe critical behavior and tests the universality of the interfacial fluctuations .",
    "we investigate a model introduced by zhuo , redner , and park@xcite that also has a bicritical point at the junction of two absorbing phase transitions .",
    "we find that the bicritical exponents in this model also fall into the bawe class and the interfacial exponents are the same as in the three species model , lending credence to the universal nature of the interfacial fluctuations .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and present results for the mean field theory in two levels of approximation .",
    "section 3 discusses our static and dynamic monte carlo simulations that yield a different phase diagram from the mean field results and produce critical exponents for the dynamic behavior that fall into the bawe class .",
    "the final section contains our conclusions .",
    "the model we study was first introduced by zhuo , park and redner@xcite .",
    "two monomers , called @xmath0 and @xmath1 , adsorb at the vacant sites of a one - dimensional lattice with probabilities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , where @xmath4 .",
    "the adsorption of a monomer at a vacant site is affected by monomers present on neighboring sites .",
    "if either neighboring site is occupied by the same species as that trying to adsorb , the adsorption probability is reduced by a factor @xmath5 , mimicking the effect of a nearest - neighbor repulsive interaction . unlike monomers on adjacent sites react immediately and leave the lattice , leading to a process limited only by adsorption .",
    "we have performed static monte carlo simulations that produce a phase diagram similar to the one found by zhuo _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the diagram , displayed in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] with @xmath2 plotted _ vs. _ @xmath6 , shows a reactive steady state ( r ) bordered by two equivalent saturated phases ( labeled a and b ) .",
    "the transitions from the reactive phase to either of the saturated phases are continuous , while the transition between the saturated phases is first - order discontinuous .",
    "the two saturated phases meet the reactive phase at a _ bicritical _",
    "point@xcite at a critical value of @xmath7 .",
    "in the case of @xmath8 , the reactive region no longer exists@xcite and the only transition line is the first - order discontinuous line between the saturated phases .",
    "another model in which the adsorption repulsion is not symmetric ( only a s feel the repulsion ) has been studied @xcite , and its critical behavior was found to be in the dp universality class .",
    "however , no effort was made to determine either the location of the bicritical point or the bicritical behavior of the model .",
    "to analyze the kinetics of this model , it is useful to perform a mean - field analysis .",
    "while such analysis neglects long - range correlations and thus can not be expected to properly predict critical properties , it should properly predict the qualitative structure of the phase diagram , including the existence of continuous transitions and multi - critical points .",
    "the mean - field analysis also provides a starting point for studying the importance of such fluctuations , which become particularly important near continuous phase transitions .",
    "the mean - field approach we use@xcite studies the time evolution of clusters of sites , the approximation coming in truncating the probabilities of observing clusters of larger size into probabilities for smaller size clusters .",
    "the analysis presented below of this 1d model includes clusters consisting of up to triplets of adjacent sites .    at a particular time , a lattice with @xmath9 sites will have @xmath10 vacancies , the remaining sites being filled with @xmath11 a monomers and @xmath12 @xmath1 monomers .",
    "the density of species @xmath13 , @xmath1 , @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "we have the obvious constraint @xmath16 so we can take @xmath17 and @xmath18 as independent .",
    "we next consider clusters of pairs of sites , where we define @xmath19 as the number of pairs with species @xmath20 on one site and @xmath21 on the site to its right , and the pair density @xmath22 . because of the immediate reaction of @xmath23 pairs we have @xmath24 .",
    "using relations between the pair and site occupancies @xmath25 only two of the pair densities are independent of the @xmath26 , which we choose to be @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    for the clusters of triples we define @xmath29 as the number of triples with species @xmath21 in the central site , species @xmath20 to the left , and species @xmath30 to the right , with the corresponding densities @xmath31 .",
    "the prohibition of adjacent @xmath23 pairs and the relations between the numbers of clusters of triples and pairs of sites    @xmath32    gives a total of 6 independent triple densities : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the last two are equal in a homogeneous steady state .",
    "we must calculate the rate that each of these densities change due to four allowed kinetic processes : deposition of an @xmath0 without reaction , removal of an @xmath0 by reaction with a @xmath1 adsorbing next to it , deposition of a @xmath1 without reaction , and removal of a @xmath1 by reaction by an adsorbing @xmath0 .",
    "these four processes are detailed in table  [ ratetable ] .",
    "because of the symmetry of the reaction rules , we will usually only present explicit formulae for half of the equations ; the remainder can be found by interchanging @xmath0 and @xmath1 everywhere in the equations .",
    "the exact equations for the single site densities are @xmath39 which clearly shows the @xmath40 symmetry noted above .    by considering each of the possible reactions in table  [ ratetable ] ,",
    "the equation for the @xmath41 pairs is @xmath42 where we have denoted densities of quartets of sites in an obvious extension of our notation .",
    "finally the triples obey the equations    @xmath43    in general , for a cluster of @xmath44 sites , the adsorption processes link clusters of @xmath44 sites to clusters of @xmath45 sites and the reaction processes link to clusters of @xmath46 sites .    to close the equations we perform a truncation . in the site approximation",
    ", we ignore any spatial correlations and solve just eqn .",
    "( [ siteode ] )  and its partner for @xmath18  using eqn .",
    "( [ siteconstraint ] ) and the approximation @xmath47 .",
    "we find the boundary between the saturated @xmath0 phase and the reactive phase by finding the combination of parameters @xmath2 and @xmath6 where the saturated phase fixed point loses its stability .",
    "this occurs when @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath1-saturated phase boundary is given by @xmath49 .",
    "these are shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ meanfld ] .",
    "the absorbing state transitions are continuous but there is no coexistence line between the saturated phases , just as we found in ref .  .",
    "in the pair approximation , we replace correlations of triples and larger clusters of sites by approximating them as @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "each term in parentheses like @xmath52 has the simple interpretation as the conditional probability of finding species @xmath30 given that the site to the left is occupied by species @xmath21 .",
    "we again find the phase diagram by determining where the stability of the poisoned phase fixed point of the system of eqns .",
    "( [ siteode ] ) and ( [ pairode ] ) vanishes .",
    "unlike the site approximation , solving the equations to determine the phase boundary was determined numerically .",
    "this procedure required some care because , although terms like @xmath53 and @xmath54 vanish on the phase boundary , their ratio , which appears in eqns .",
    "( [ siteode ] ) and ( [ pairode ] ) in our approximation , is nonzero .",
    "we note that , just as for the three species model@xcite , fig .",
    "[ meanfld ] shows that this approximation fails to produce the coexistence curve between the saturated phases .",
    "this indicates that the large domains of @xmath0 and @xmath1 that appear close to the absorbing phase transitions are not accurately represented in the site and pair approximations . in both of these approximations ,",
    "the width of the reactive window is proportional to @xmath55 as @xmath6 approaches one .",
    "the triple approximation is similar in spirit to the pair approximation with higher order correlations being decomposed as conditional probabilities via @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the numerically determined phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ meanfld ] and shows little difference from the pair approximation except very close to @xmath58 .",
    "surprisingly , the triple approximation fails here to move the bicritical point away from @xmath58 , which did happen in our earlier work@xcite on the three - species model .",
    "very close to @xmath58 , the width of the reactive region varies as @xmath59 in this approximation .",
    "we stop the mean field approach at the triple approximation because the increase in algebra is not compensated by an improvement of the phase diagram .",
    "the failure of this mean field approach to produce a realistic position for the bicritical point is linked to the fact that the probability of observing a long cluster of sites all filled with one species , which is approximated here by the probability of a smaller cluster raised to a power , will decay exponentially with the size of the cluster .",
    "however , the simulations presented in this paper and previous work@xcite clearly show that at the bicritical point large domains of each species are present in the steady state , with the fundamental dynamical variables being the domain walls .",
    "the behavior of this model at the critical lines has been studied and found to be in the dp universality class@xcite , which we verified using @xmath60 independent runs of up to @xmath61 time steps .",
    "what has not been studied is the behavior at the bicritical point .",
    "we use two types of `` epidemic '' simulations@xcite to study the system s behavior at the bicritical point .",
    "the first ( defect dynamics ) starts with the lattice in a configuration close to one of the saturated phases , in which a lone vacancy is surrounded by members of one species .",
    "the second ( interface dynamics ) studies the time evolution of a minimum - width interface between the two saturated phases ( a lone vacancy is bordered on one side by a s and by b s on the other side ) . in the defect dynamics , the simulations are over when the lattice becomes totally saturated . for the interface dynamics the end of the simulation",
    "is marked by the `` collapse '' of the interface back to its minimum width@xcite .",
    "since the total number of possible adsorption sites is usually very small , we use a variable time algorithm to improve computational efficiency .",
    "a list of possible adsorption sites is kept during the simulation , and one of these sites is picked at random for adsorption according to @xmath62 and , if applicable , @xmath6 .",
    "time is then incremented by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number of vacancies in the lattice at that time . to avoid end effects , we always start with a lattice that is so large as to be considered of infinite extent .    during the defect dynamics simulations , we measure @xmath65 , the probability that the system will not become saturated at time @xmath66 , @xmath64 , the number of vacancies in the lattice at time @xmath66 , @xmath67 , the number of species opposite to those of the initial saturated configuration at time @xmath66 , and @xmath68 , the square size of the reactive region in a surviving run at time @xmath66 . at a continuous phase transition as",
    "@xmath69 these quantities obey power laws @xmath70    the exponent @xmath71 is not independent of the others , but gives a useful check on the calculation . the scaling law for @xmath71 can be understood by considering the set of all surviving runs .",
    "the width of the defect region grows as @xmath72 .",
    "this region is filled with vacants and sites occupied by either of the species , so @xmath73^{1/2 } = c(n_v+n_a+n_b)p(t)$ ] , with @xmath74 some constant .",
    "the factor @xmath65 accounts for the fact only the surviving runs contribute to @xmath68 .",
    "if we further assume that in this defect ( which is very large for long times since @xmath75 ) we have the same kind of configurations as we would see in a static simulation , we should have @xmath76 .",
    "thus we should see @xmath77^{1/2}\\over cp(t ) } - n_v(t ) \\sim c_1t^{z/2-\\delta } - c_2t^{\\eta } \\label{etaolaw}\\ ] ] so we see that @xmath78 .    for the interface dynamics simulations ,",
    "we define @xmath65 to be the probability of the interface of avoiding collapse back to minimum width , with @xmath79 the vacancy concentration and @xmath68 the square - size of the interface , both similar to the above .",
    "@xmath67 has no meaning or corresponding equivalent in this type of simulation , so it is not measured . as @xmath69 these quantities obey power laws @xmath80    log - log plots of these measured quantities as a function of time are straight lines at a phase transition and show curvature away from transitions . a precise estimate for both the location of the bicritical point and the values of the exponents can be obtained by examining the local slopes of the curves on a log - log plot . for example ,",
    "the effective exponent @xmath81 is defined as @xmath82 with similar definitions for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "we usually choose @xmath86 for our numerical work , with other values like @xmath87 and @xmath88 being used to check the results . at the bicritical point , the value of the effective exponent should extrapolate to the bicritical value in the long time limit ( @xmath89 ) . away from the bicritical point , the local slope will show strong upward or downward curvature as @xmath90 .    to determine the value of both the critical exponents and their uncertainties , we use a technique different from that typically employed@xcite .",
    "the data collected at the bicritical point is divided into ten data sets that are statistically independent . a linear regression is then performed on each set , with the intercept the only pertinent quantity .",
    "the value for the exponent is then calculated as the simple mean of the ten intercepts , and the uncertainty is the standard error of the mean .",
    "all of the results quoted in this paper were obtained using this technique , which gives a more unbiased estimate of the uncertainty than previous methods which used the quality of the linear fit to the entire data set .",
    "figure  [ defect ] shows the local slopes of the data for the defect dynamics simulations for @xmath91 and @xmath6 near the bicritical value .",
    "the system started near an a saturated phase , but the symmetry of the model dictates that we could equally as well have started near a b saturated phase .",
    "this data was calculated from @xmath92 independent runs of up to @xmath60 time steps at each @xmath6 value .    the analysis presented in fig .",
    "[ defect ] gives a critical repulsion value of @xmath93 .",
    "we find values of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 for the critical exponents . from these values",
    "we determine the bicritical behavior falls in the bawe universality class , for which@xcite the exponents are @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "the value of @xmath71 does not agree very well with the scaling law @xmath101 derived above , but that is the result of the effect of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ etaolaw ] ) , which acts as a large correction to the asymptotic time behavior .",
    "the agreement with the scaling law improves when the data for @xmath102 is fit using the form ( [ etaolaw ] ) with the exponents @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 fixed and the coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 are fitted .",
    "figure  [ interface ] shows the results from the interface dynamics simulations , for three values of @xmath6 near @xmath93 . from @xmath108 independent runs of up to @xmath60 time steps we find values of @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111",
    "this type of simulation gives us information about the competition between the growth of the two saturated phases that is not gained in the defect dynamics type of simulations .",
    "first , notice that @xmath112 , the exponent governing the size of the interface , equals @xmath103 .",
    "also , although @xmath113 and @xmath114 have different values than their defect dynamics cousins , the sum @xmath115 , which controls the time evolution of the number of vacancies in just the surviving runs , is the same as @xmath116 within statistical error .",
    "this indicates that the critical spreading of the defect is insensitive as to whether it is bordered on each side by the same saturated phase or by two different , though equivalent , saturated phases .",
    "the independent dynamical exponent @xmath113 measured here agrees with the value found in the three - species model@xcite , suggesting that its value is universal .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of an interacting one - dimensional adsorption - limited monomer - monomer model .",
    "the like - neighbor repulsion in the model leads to the presence of a large reactive region and a bicritical point  inaccurately termed a tricritical point in ref .",
    " where the first - order discontinuous transition between the two symmetric saturated phases meets the two continuous transitions from either saturated phase to the reactive phase .",
    "we have used two types of epidemic simulations to study the behavior of the system at the bicritical point . using the defect dynamics simulations we determine the bicritical behavior falls in the bawe universality class . with the interface dynamics we measure a new universal number @xmath113 , related to the probability that a minimum - width interface between the two saturated phases will avoid collapse back to its minimum size .",
    "it would be interesting to measure the exponent @xmath113 for other models in which two symmetric adsorbing phases meet a reactive phase .",
    "in addition , by comparing the results from the two types of simulations we find that the time evolution of the number of vacancies in the lattice in the surviving runs is the same in both cases .",
    "this suggests that the critical spreading of a localized defect is insensitive to initial conditions , and the characteristic fluctuations in the domain walls behave differently than a defect in a homogeneous phase .",
    "the failure of mean field theory to describe the qualitative features of the phase diagram , even when clusters of triples of sites were included , points to the importance of large domains of each species in the vicinity of the bicritical point",
    ". the large domains , which are clearly apparent in static monte carlo simulations , are the necessary background for the simplest dynamical variables needed to describe the bicritical point , namely , the domain walls .",
    "the random walks of these walls , coupled with the fact that their number is conserved modulo 2 , are the crucial ingredients in the critical behavior at the bicritical point .",
