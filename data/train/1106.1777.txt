    "the bilayer systems with pairing of electrons of one layer with holes of the other layer have attracted considerable interest @xcite because such electron - hole ( @xmath0 ) pairs can be condensed to a superfluid state , accompanied by a counterflow superconductivity ( as predicted in refs .",
    "this special type of superconductivity manifests itself as equal and antiparallel nondissipative currents flowing in the conducting layers when the @xmath0 pairs move in one direction .",
    "experiments on antiparallel currents were carried out with gaas / algaas heterostructures formed by two closely spaced quantum wells , each containing a quasi - two - dimensional electron gas @xcite .",
    "it has been found that in a perpendicular magnetic field , when the total landau level filling factor @xmath3 is equal to unity ( @xmath4 ) , a lowering of the temperature leads to a significant ( more than an order of magnitude ) decrease of the longitudinal resistance @xmath5 and the hall resistance @xmath6 in each layer .",
    "the obtained results can be interpreted in terms of superfluidity of the @xmath0 pairs with spatially separated components ( interwell excitons ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the condition @xmath7 is equivalent to the equality @xmath8 which means that the number of occupied states in the first layer exactly coincides with the number of vacant states ( holes ) in the second layer . if the temperature @xmath9 , all electrons from the first layer and all holes from the second layer form @xmath0 pairs and there are no unpaired carriers .",
    "due to superfluidity of the @xmath0 pairs the longitudinal resistance @xmath5 in each layer is equal to zero .",
    "the hall resistance @xmath6 must also become zero because @xmath0 pairs ( being electrically neutral ) does not contribute to the hall effect .",
    "the residual values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 observed in the experiment ( at @xmath10 are caused by motion of free vortices and unpaired carriers respectively .",
    "the properties of the superfluid state of @xmath0 pairs in the bilayer system depend critically on the interlayer distance @xmath11 .",
    "experiments show that the decrease of @xmath5 and @xmath6 described above is not observed if @xmath11 exceeds @xmath12 - @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the magnetic length @xcite . according to theoretical concepts",
    "@xcite , with increasing @xmath11 the coherence of @xmath0 pairs breaks down if the coherence length becomes smaller than the average distance between the pairs .",
    "this transition is of a quantum nature , since at large @xmath11 the interlayer coherence is destroyed by quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the main attention in this article is paid to the properties of systems with relatively small interlayer distances @xmath15 .",
    "this range of interlayer distances is quite important because in a homogeneous system the critical temperature of the superfluid transition ( @xmath16 ) reaches its maximum value at @xmath17 ( see later ) .",
    "the maximum is rather sharp , since with reducing @xmath11 the interaction between the @xmath0 pairs is weakened , and the value of @xmath16 decreases rapidly due to thermal fluctuations .",

    "in the bilayer systems that are based on semiconductor heterostructures , electrons fill of the quantum wells due to ionization of donor atoms . we will show that the electric field of the donor layer decreases the superfluid current of @xmath0 pairs in the bilayer system .",
    "this decrease is caused by correlations between spatial fluctuations of superfluid density @xmath19 and superfluid velocity @xmath20 , namely , under influence of the donor electric field the superfluid density @xmath19 becomes inhomogeneous , and due to the current conservation law @xmath21 in the regions where @xmath19 is higher the value of @xmath22 is lower .",

    "the equation ( [ 1 ] ) is similar to the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite , that is not surprising since at low density the @xmath0 pairs act as a weakly nonideal bose gas @xcite . due to inhomogeneity of the bilayer system the coefficients in ( [ 1 ] ) ( the effective mass of the pair @xmath25 , its polarizability @xmath26 and the interaction constant @xmath27 ) are functions of coordinates in the plane of the layers : @xmath28 .",
    "explicit expressions for these coefficients and for the potential energy of the @xmath0 pairs @xmath29 will be shown below .",
    "the significant difference of ( [ 1 ] ) from the gross - pitaevskii equation consists in changing the structure of the first term in the right hand side .",
    "firstly , the action of the gradient operator spreads to the coordinate dependent mass of the @xmath0 pair , and secondly , the gradient operator itself is `` extended '' with an addition related to the polarizability of the @xmath0 pairs .",

    "note that just at @xmath99 and @xmath100 bilayer systems possess properties which can be explained by appearance of superfluidity of @xmath0 pairs @xcite .",

    "the influence of the randomly distributed inhomogeneities on the superfluidity of the @xmath0 pairs in bilayer systems has been considered in this article .",
    "an important and partly unexpected result is a high sensitivity of systems with small interlayer distances ( @xmath177 ) to inhomogeneities .",

    "the physical origin of the strong suppression of @xmath91 is the weakness of the interaction between the @xmath0 pairs for @xmath177 ( see eq .  ( [ 17 ] ) ) .",
    "the results of this article have been obtained under assumption that the filling factor of the ground landau level @xmath179 . from our point of view",
    "this limitation is not significant , since according to equalities ( [ 40 ] ) and ( [ 41 ] ) the increase of the pair density @xmath132 ( i. e. the increase of @xmath180 ) leads to the increase of the critical temperature @xmath16 , but does not change the picture represented in fig .",
    "3 . thus , one can expect that these results qualitatively correctly describe the behavior of @xmath164 in the inhomogeneous systems with filling factors @xmath181 which are commonly used in experiments on finding the superfluidity of the @xmath0 pairs .",
    "also we note that several important conclusions for future experiments can be drawn .",
    "firstly , one of the critical conditions for observing superfluidity in bilayer electron - hole systems is a high degree of homogeneity of these systems .",
    "secondly , in homogeneous systems the maximum value of @xmath16 is reached for the interlayer distance @xmath182 .",
    "the superfluid phase of the interwell excitons has to be looked for in the vicinity of this value .",
    "additionally one has to keep in mind that in the real , i. e. inhomogeneous , systems the range of the interlayer distances @xmath11 at which the observation of the superfluid phase is most probable , is shifted towards higher values ( see fig ."
