    "solutions of einstein s field equations representing disk - like configurations of matter are of great astrophysical interest , since they can be used as models of galaxies or accretion disks .",
    "disk solutions can be static or stationary and with or without radial pressure .",
    "solutions for static thin disks without radial pressure were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , and morgan and morgan @xcite , and with radial pressure by morgan and morgan @xcite .",
    "other classes of static thin disk solutions have been obtained @xcite@xcite , while stationary thin disks were studied in @xcite@xcite .",
    "an exact solution to the problem of a rigidly rotating disk of dust in terms of ultraelliptic functions was reported in @xcite .",
    "also thin disks with radial tension @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite and both electric and magnetic fields @xcite have been studied .",
    "the non - linear superposition of a disk and a black hole was first considered by lemos and letelier @xcite .",
    "models of thin disks and thin disks with halos made of perfect fluids were considered in @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the `` displace , cut and reflect '' method ( sec .",
    "[ sec_form ] ) of constructing thick static disks was considered by gonzlez and letelier @xcite .",
    "an interesting class of solutions of the einstein - maxwell field equations are the conformastatic space - times with charged dust , in which the charge density is equal to the mass density .",
    "therefore , the matter is in equilibrium because the mutual gravitational attractions are balanced by the electrical repulsions .",
    "this kind of matter has been called by some authors `` electrically counterpoised dust '' ( ecd ) .",
    "distributions of ecd in equilibrium in both classical and relativistic theories were studied by bonnor @xcite .",
    "models of oblate and prolate spheroids made of ecd were considered , respectively , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "grses @xcite and varela @xcite studied static spheres of ecd .",
    "disk sources for conformastationary metrics ( the stationary version of conformastatic metrics ) were considered in @xcite .",
    "although one may intuitively expect that astrophysical objects do not have a net charge , there exists the possibility that electrons escape from a compact star , leaving behind a positively - charged one ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we apply the well known `` displace , cut and reflect '' method to the superposition of two extreme reissner - nordstrm black holes aligned on the @xmath1 axis to generate static disks of ecd on the @xmath0 plane .",
    "next we repeat the same procedure to reissner - nordstrm black holes aligned on the @xmath2 axis and generate non - axisymmetric distributions of ecd on the plane @xmath0 .",
    "we briefly study the effective potential of geodesic motion of neutral test particles on these structures .",
    "the paper is divided as follows .",
    "[ sec_form ] discusses the einstein - maxwell equations , the `` displace , cut and reflect '' method and the particular class of conformastat metrics . in sec .",
    "[ sec_aligned1 ] disks of charged dust are constructed using the superposition of two aligned reissner - nordstrm black holes and in sec .",
    "[ sec_aligned2 ] we obtain non - axisymetric distributions of charged dust .",
    "we also present some analysis of the geodesic motion on these matter distributions .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec_disc ] , we summarize our results .",
    "we consider a static space - time with coordinates @xmath3 and a line element of the form @xmath4    the einstein - maxwell system of equations is given by @xmath5 where all symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "we use geometric units @xmath6 .    the method used to generate the metric of the disk and its material content is the well known ``",
    "displace , cut and reflect '' method that was first used by kuzmin @xcite and toomre @xcite to construct newtonian models of disks , and later extended to general relativity ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the material and electric content of the disk will be described by functions that are distributions with support on the disk .",
    "the method can be divided into the following steps : first , in a space wherein we have a compact source of gravitational field , we choose a surface ( in our case , the plane @xmath0 ) that divides the space into two pieces : one with no singularities or sources and the other with the sources .",
    "then we disregard the part of the space with singularities and use the surface to make an inversion of the nonsingular part of the space .",
    "this results in a space with a singularity that is a delta function with support on @xmath0 .",
    "this procedure is mathematically equivalent to making the transformation @xmath7 , with @xmath8 constant . in the einstein tensor",
    "we have first and second derivatives of @xmath1 . remembering that @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the heaviside function and the dirac distribution , the einstein - maxwell equations give us @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electromagnetic tensor eq .",
    "( [ eq_elm_ten ] ) , @xmath15 is the energy - momentum tensor on the plane @xmath0 and @xmath16 is the current density on the plane @xmath0 .    for the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq_metric1 ] ) , the non - zero components of @xmath15 are @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the jump of the first derivatives of the metric tensor on the plane @xmath0 , @xmath19 and the other quantities are evaluated at @xmath20 .",
    "the electromagnetic potential for an electric field is @xmath21 using eq .",
    "( [ eq_elec_pot ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq_max_disk ] ) , the only non - zero component of the current density on the plane @xmath0 is @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the jump of the first derivatives of the electromagnetic potential on the plane @xmath0 , @xmath24 and the other quantities are evaluated at @xmath20 .",
    "the `` physical measure '' of length in the direction @xmath25 for metric ( [ eq_metric1 ] ) is @xmath26 , then the invariant distribution is @xmath27 .",
    "thus the `` true '' surface energy density @xmath28 and pressures or tensions @xmath29 are : @xmath30 since @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , the `` true '' surface charge density @xmath33 is @xmath34    let us now specialize metric eq .  ( [ eq_metric1 ] ) to a conformastat form by considering @xmath35 with this choice , in the absence of matter , the einstein - maxwell equations are satisfied provided ( a ) v satisfies laplace equation and ( b ) the relation between v and the electric potential @xmath36 is of the form ( see , for example , @xcite and the appendix of @xcite for a detailed deduction ) @xmath37 when static charged dust matter is included , the above conditions imply that charge density must be equal to the mass density .",
    "an interesting feature of conformastat metrics is that they permit the construction of complete asymmetrical relativistic configurations of matter in equibrium . with metric coefficients given by ( [ eq_choice ] )",
    ", we find the following expressions for the energy density and pressures eq .",
