    "the abc effect , a mesonic structure of isospin @xmath14 , was first observed by abashian , booth and crow in the reaction @xmath15he@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "later on , it was also shown to appear in several other hadronic reactions , like e.g. in @xmath0h@xmath17 @xcite and in @xmath18h@xmath19h@xmath20he@xmath17 @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the abc structure shows up as a cross section peak at missing masses of about 300  350 mev , and with a position and width that varies quite rapidly according to the kinematic conditions .",
    "the only possible explanation for the effect seems to be an enhancement in the double pion production which is caused by a strongly energy dependent production amplitude .",
    "since the abc effect is present in reactions of different type , it seems to be quite natural to assume that there exists a common underlying mechanism for the @xmath5 production which should be able to explain all the different experiments . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", @xmath0h@xmath21 has to be the reaction to analyze first since it involves only two - nucleon states beside the pions and can thus be treated in the most accurate and direct way . for this reaction",
    ", the abc enhancement corresponds to a beam momentum of approximately 2 gev / c in the laboratory system and to a center of mass energy of @xmath22 , i.e. twice the mass of the @xmath23 resonance .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that the two pions are dominantly produced via a double @xmath24 excitation .",
    "indeed , as it has already been shown by bar  nir et al .",
    "@xcite , the main features of the experimental spectrum can be understood by assuming the @xmath6 mechanism to be the most efficient one for @xmath25 production in the energy region under consideration .    in the present work ,",
    "we will present a new calculation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 excitations in the @xmath0h@xmath21 reaction which explicitly includes the effects of residual interactions in the intermediate resonance states @xcite .",
    "our aim is to show that the @xmath5 production may serve as an interesting tool for further examination of direct @xmath6 and @xmath7 potentials which are not very well known . for this purpose",
    ", we will also examine how the spin structure of the @xmath6 excitation influences the angular distribution of the two pions .",
    "our model is based on a coupled channel approach in a non  relativistic framework .",
    "the potentials of the residual interactions are adopted from a meson exchange model @xcite . in this work ,",
    "contributions from @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 exchange are included .",
    "the @xmath24 resonance is treated thereby as a quasi  particle with a given mass and an energy ",
    "dependent , intrinsic width .",
    "experimental results for the @xmath0h@xmath1 cross section in the abc energy region have been obtained by plouin et al .",
    "@xcite at @xmath2 gev . in order to allow for a direct comparison with our theoretical results ,",
    "the contribution from one pion production has been subtracted from the spectra .",
    "it has been stressed that there might be some additional background from @xmath26 production @xcite due to momentum spread of the beam , but since there is no microscopic model for this contribution available , we decided not to perform any further corrections .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that not all of the uncertainties have been included in the experimental error bars .    in section [ sec:1 ]",
    ", we will present the theoretical framework of our model .",
    "the results of our calculation are presented and discussed in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "we are interested here in the calculation of the deuteron spectrum for the @xmath0h@xmath1 reaction , i.e. in the double differential cross section @xmath27 . using relativistic kinematics ,",
    "the cross section is given as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the relative momentum of the two pions and @xmath30 is the sum of their energies . the indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 refer to the neutron projectile ( proton target ) and the deuteron ejectile , respectively .",
    "the center of mass momentum of the @xmath5 system @xmath33 is fixed by momentum conservation and equals @xmath34 . as usual , the function @xmath35 is defined to be @xmath36 \\left [ s-(m_p - m_n)^2 \\right]$ ] .",
    "finally , @xmath37 denotes the transition amplitude for the reaction ; in the case of the unpolarized cross section , an average over the initial and a sum over the final spin orientations has to be performed .    from eq",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) one easily obtains the deuteron spectrum @xmath38 since we are going to calculate the transititon matrixelement in a non  relativistic approach , the above expression has to be evaluated in the deuteron rest frame ( drf ) where the deuteron is well described by the usual non  relativistic wave function @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the transformation of the spectrum into the laboratory frame ( lab ) is performed by using the simple relation @xmath39      in our microscopic model for the @xmath0h@xmath1 reaction , we take into account two different reaction mechanisms corresponding to the feynman diagrams presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : diagrams ] .",
    "the first mechanism ( a ) involves the excitation of a double delta ( @xmath6 ) intermediate state where both @xmath24 resonances subsequently decay into a pion and a nucleon . in the case of the second mechanism ( b ) , each of the two pions couples to the same @xmath24 , hence only one resonance (",
    "i.e. a @xmath7 system ) is excited .",
    "for the explicit calculation of the two matrix elements , wa take advantage of the principle of detailed balance .",
    "this allows us to assume that the deuteron is in the initial state and absorbes the two pions , which finally will lead to a @xmath40 state .",
    "the absorption of only one pion with momentum @xmath41 is described by the operator @xmath42 the exponential term represents the plane wave of the pion field .",
    "the structure of the @xmath43 coupling follows from the usual interaction lagrangian @xcite in the non  relativistic reduction .",

    "this procedure has already been described in ref .",
    "@xcite and can easily be applied to the present calculation .",
    "input parameters of the model are the meson and baryon masses , coupling constants , and formfactor cutoffs at each vertex .",
    "the values we used in our calculations are given in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "most of these quantities , of course , are physical observables that are already determined from other experiments , e.g. from @xmath68 scattering @xcite .",
    "only the sigma meson and cutoff parameters remain to be fixed .",
    "they have been adjusted to fit the experimental data for the one pion production @xmath75h@xmath76 .",
    "we made sure that not only the total cross section but also the angular distributions and analyzing powers are correctly reproduced in the @xmath24 resonance energy region @xcite .",
    "after this consistency check , we may now continue and discuss our results for the @xmath5 production @xmath0h@xmath1 .      in fig .",

    "the available phase space for the @xmath5 production is indicated by the dashed line .",
    "obviously , the cross section does not follow the phase space but shows a characteristic structure which three pronounced peaks .",
    "the two outer maxima correspond to a kinematical situation where the invariant mass @xmath80 of the @xmath5 system is minimal , i.e. where @xmath81 . the broad central maximum , on the other hand , is located at the position where @xmath82 has its maximal value ( 511 mev in the present case ) . in the cms , this situation will be realized if all the kinetic energy is taken by the two pions and the deuteron remains at rest .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : theospect ] , our model is able to explain the characteristic structure of the experimental spectrum .",
    "the solid line represents the full result with all intermediate interactions included . the @xmath6 mechanism , for which the feynman diagram was presented in fig .  [ fig : diagrams](a ) , is in fact the only important contribution to @xmath5 production in the energy range under consideration .",
    "the cross section contribution due to the @xmath7 mechanism of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](b ) is almost negligible .",
    "since the optimal energy for this second mechanism would be @xmath83 , its suppression in the abc energy region is not surprising .",
    "with focus on the @xmath6 excitation and following the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , the origin of the different maxima can be understood quite easily .",
    "let us define @xmath84 where @xmath85 denote the four  momenta of the two pions .",
    "the excitation of a @xmath6 system is most effective if the invariant masses of the two @xmath24 s are approximately equal ( and hence both close to the resonant mass ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath86 and since @xmath87 this is equivalent to @xmath88 this condition can be fullfilled in two ways :    1 .",
    "@xmath89 and therefore @xmath90 , or 2 .",
    "@xmath91 in the cms of the two pions ( which means that the deuteron restframe and the @xmath5 restframe are identical ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the two pions carry the whole kinetic energy , and @xmath92 max .",
    "the first situation leads to the outer maxima and corresponds to the parallel decay of the two @xmath24 s because of @xmath93 , i.e. the relative momentum is very small .",
    "the second situation explains the central maximum and corresponds to the antiparallel decay of the @xmath6 excitation for which the relative momentum is maximal . in the deuteron restframe",
    ", the different kinematical configurations for the three maxima can be visualized as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics ] .",
    "the kinematical situations leading to the three maxima of the deuteron spectrum are also clearly visible in the angular distribution of the pions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : angdist1 ] , we show the triple differential cross section @xmath94 for different deuteron laboratory momenta .",
    "it is plotted as a function of @xmath95 which is the angle between the relative momentum @xmath96 of the two pions and the beam axis , as given in the deuteron rest frame ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : kinematics ] ) .    for the two outer maxima ( @xmath97 gev and @xmath98 gev ) ,",
    "the pion momenta are nearly parallel and hence the relative momentum is dominantly perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "consequently , the differential cross section reaches its largest value at @xmath99 .    for the central maximum ( @xmath100 gev ) , however , the pion momenta are antiparallel , and all angles @xmath95 are kinematically possible .",
    "if there was no spin dependence of the excitation and the residual interaction , an isotropic distribution would be the result .",
    "the observed angular variation of the cross section is thus reflecting the spin structure of the process which mainly follows from the @xmath10 and @xmath11 exchange contributions to the @xmath101 transition potential .    in order to examine this spin structure in more detail",
    ", we will neglect for the moment the residual interaction and the possibility of spin  flips .",
    "then , the spin  longitudinal @xmath10 exchange leads to an operator proportional to @xmath102 \\ ;    \\left [ ( \\vec s_2 \\cdot \\vec q \\ , ) \\ , ( \\vec s_2^\\dagger \\cdot \\vec k_b ) \\right ]     \\ , \\sim \\ , ( \\vec q \\cdot \\vec k_a \\ , ) \\ , ( \\vec q \\cdot \\vec k_b \\ , ) \\ , ,",
    "] ] where @xmath103 are the pion momenta and @xmath104 is the momentum transfer from the neutron projectile to the proton target . if both the pion momenta are parallel ( or antiparallel ) to @xmath104 , the corresponding cross section will be largest .",
    "this results in a maximum at @xmath105 in the spin  longitudinal channel .    in complete analogy , the spin ",

    "transverse channel is reached if both the pion momenta are perpendicular to @xmath104 , i.e. if @xmath99 .    indeed",
    ", the theoretical curves in fig .  [ fig : angdist2 ] exactly reflect the expected shapes .",
    "we conclude that a measurement of the pion angular distribution would be very helpful in order to reveal the spin structure of the interaction .",
    "effects of residual interactions can be examined in both the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 system since these are the intermediate configurations in our model .",
    "the influence of the corresponding interaction potentials on the theoretical spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vinfl ] for the case of forward scattering ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the dash  dotted line was calculated without any residual interaction , i.e. with @xmath107 for the intermediate states .",
    "the typical abc structure with its three peaks as discussed in section [ sec : spectrum ] is clearly present .",
    "our result comes quite close to the fully relativistic calculation of bar  nir et al .",
    "@xcite which also does not include the residual interactions .    by choosing @xmath108 but still neglecting the direct @xmath6 interaction , we obtain the dashed line . here , the maxima are even more pronounced .",
    "the enlargement of the peak cross sections is due to the reduction of the excitation energy for the @xmath7 system which is caused by the attractive @xmath7 potential . for @xmath109 as in the present case ,",
    "the whole system is thus closer to the resonance energy .",
    "the relative position of the two invariant @xmath24 masses remains however unchanged since in our model they are fixed independently of @xmath58 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath6 potential can directly influence the relative wave function of the @xmath6 system via a redistribution of momentum within the two particle system .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : vinfl ] has been calculated with the full residual interaction @xmath110 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath8 results in a transfer of strength from the maxima to the regions between which are kinematically less favoured .",
    "this transfer takes place because the optimal configuration of equal @xmath24 masses can now be reached even if the initial energy distribution of the two pions was asymmetric . as a consequence , the cross section is enhanced between the peaks and simultanously the magnitude of the peaks is reduced .",
    "this reduction is more prominent for the outer maxima since they are related to a small relative momentum of the @xmath6 system . for the central maximum ,",
    "the relative momentum is large and therefore only a slight influence of the @xmath6 potential is observed .    obviously , the residual interactions play quite an important role in the @xmath5 production and significantly influence the deuteron spectrum .",
    "the inclusion of these effects in the calculation clearly improves the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "studying the dependence of the deuteron spectrum on the scattering angle @xmath111 , we find that the theoretical cross section for @xmath6 excitation is decreasing too fast .",
    "exemplatory we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : anguldep ] our calculations for @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the experimental data @xcite are underestimated by a factor @xmath114 .",
    "other microscopic calculations , e.g. assuming a two nucleon exchange as the dominant reaction mechanism , yield a comparable angular dependence and are also not able to describe the data @xcite .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is not understood .",
    "maybe more than only one production mechanism has to be taken into account in order to solve this problem .",
    "[ fig : energdep ] is demonstrating the energy dependence of the deuteron spectrum in our model .",
    "one recognizes that the central maximum is getting more pronounced if the total energy increases .",
    "we remind the reader that this peak corresponds to the @xmath6 excitation with maximal relative momentum , which already gives the natural explanation of the observed effect .    after integration over deuteron momentum and scattering angle ,",
    "the total cross section for the @xmath115 reaction is obtained . in fig .",
    "[ fig : totcs ] , our theoretical result is compared to the experimental data @xcite . in the @xmath6 resonance energy region ,",
    "i.e. for a neutron momentum of @xmath116 gev , the agreement is quite good .",
    "this confirms our assumption that the @xmath5 production in the regime of the abc effect is dominated by the @xmath6 excitation mechanism . on the other hand",
    ", one recognizes that the experimental cross section close to the @xmath5 production threshold ( @xmath117 gev ) is understimated by nearly two orders of magnitude . in this case , the total energy of @xmath118 is simply not sufficient for the excitation of a @xmath6 system , and other production mechanisms will be more important . to mention just two possibilities ,",
    "the pions could be produced by s ",
    "wave rescattering or via excitation of the @xmath119 resonance , as recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "since there is also experimental evidence @xcite that the abc structure completely disappears when approaching the @xmath25 production threshold , further theoretical investigations of the low energy region would be of high interest .",
    "to summarize we have shown that the @xmath4 excitation is the dominant reaction mechanism in the @xmath0h@xmath1 two pion production at @xmath2 gev / c .",
    "it is able to explain the abc effect as observed in the experimental deuteron spectrum .",
    "hereby , the residual interactions in the intermediate @xmath6 and @xmath7 states play an important role .",
    "we obtain good agreement with experimental data at forward scattering but too fast a decrease of the cross section for higher scattering angles of the deuteron .",
    "the total cross section is also underestimated close to the @xmath25 production threshold where other reaction mechanisms get more important .",
    "furthermore , we found that the spin structure of the @xmath6 excitation directly influences the angular distribution of the two pions .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath25 production in the abc energy region may well serve as a tool for closer examination of direct @xmath6 interaction and transition potentials .",
