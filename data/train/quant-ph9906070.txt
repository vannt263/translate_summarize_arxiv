    "in the recent years , laser cooling has constituted one of the most active research fields in atomic physics @xcite .",
    "however , the laser cooling techniques by themselves have not allowed to reach temperatures for which the quantum statistical effects become evident .",
    "in particular , only the combination of laser cooling , and evaporative @xcite or sympathetic cooling @xcite has permited in the last years to observe experimentally , the bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) in alkali gases , seventy years after its theoretical prediction @xcite . the question whether it is or it is not possible to achieve the bec only with laser cooling techniques remain , at least as an intellectual challenge .",
    "the laser  induced bec is , however , not only an academic problem , but has several advantages with respect to the nowadays widely ",
    "employed collisional mechanisms ( as evaporative cooling ) .",
    "these advantages are : ( i ) the number of atoms does not decrease during the cooling process ; ( ii ) it is possible to design a non  destructive bec detection by fluorescence measurements ; ( iii ) reacher effects can appear , since now the system is open , i.e. it is not in thermal equilibrium ; ( iv ) laser  induced condensation can be used to design techniques to pump atoms into the condensate .",
    "the latter is specially important in the contex of future atom ",
    "laser devices @xcite .",
    "the main problem which prevents experimentalists from obtaining bec by optical means is the reabsorption of spontaneously emitted photons .",
    "the most effective laser  cooling techniques ( such as vscpt @xcite , or raman cooling @xcite ) , are based on the crucial concept of dark states @xcite , i.e. states which can not absorb the laser light , but can receive population via incoherent pumping , i.e. via spontaneous emission .",
    "unfortunately , the atoms occupying the dark states are not unaffected by the photons spontaneously emitted by other atoms .",
    "this problem turns to be very important at high densities , as those required for the bec @xcite ; in such conditions dark  state cooling techniques cease to work adequately .",
    "several remedies to the reabsorption problem have been proposed , as the reduction of the dimensionality of the trap from three to two or one dimensions @xcite , or the use of traps with frequencies , @xmath0 , of the order of the recoil frequency ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the laser wavevector and m is the atomic mass ) @xcite .",
    "other , perhaps more promising , idea consists in exploiting the dependence of the reabsorption probability on the fluorescence rate @xmath3 . in particular , in the so  called _ festina lente _",
    "limit @xcite , when @xmath4 with @xmath0 the trap frequency , the heating effects of the reabsorption can be neglected .",
    "another proposal consists in working in the so  called bosonic accumulation regime @xcite , in which the reabsorption can , under certain conditions , even help to build up the condensate . in the following",
    "we shall assume that the considered system fulfills the festina lente limit .    in a series of papers @xcite",
    ", we have proposed a cooling mechanism ( which we have called dynamical cooling ) which permits the cooling of an atomic sample into an arbitrary single state of an harmonic trap , beyond the lamb  dicke limit ( i.e. when the lamb  dicke parameter @xmath5 , with @xmath6 ) . the cooling mechanism employs laser pulses of different frequencies ( and eventually different directions , phases and intensities ) , in such a way that a particular state of the trap remains dark during the cooling process , acting as a trapping state .",
    "therefore , the population is finally transferred to this particular state .",
    "we have first analysed the particular situation of a single atom in the trap @xcite , and extended the analysis to a collection of trapped bosons @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the bosonic statistics helps to achieve more robust and rapid condensation , as well as to produce non  linear effects , such as hysteresis and multistability phenomena .",
    "however , all the calculations performed so far in the analysis of the dynamical cooling scheme do not take into account the atom  atom collisions , i.e. are considered in the so  called _ ideal gas _ limit .",
    "the ideal gas limit imposes important restrictions to the physical system , in particular the atomic density can not be very large .",
    "an interesting possibility in order to achieve quasi ",
    "ideal gases consists in the `` switching  off '' of the @xmath7wave scattering length @xmath8 ( which is the main contribution to the atom  atom collisions for sufficiently low energies ) , either by employing magnetic fields ( tuning the so  called feshbach resonances @xcite ) or by using a red  detuned laser tuned between molecular resonances as proposed by fedichev _",
    "et al _ @xcite",
    ". however , without special precautions , the effects of the atom  atom collisions play a substantial role .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to analyse such effects in the context of our dynamical laser cooling scheme .    in recent years , c. w. gardiner , p. zoller and collaborators have devoted a series of papers @xcite to the decription of interacting bose gases with and without trapping potentials .",
    "these authors have developed a quantum kinetic theory of bose gases .",
    "in particular , for the case of a weakly interacting gas , a so  called quantum kinetic master equation ( qkme ) has been formulated @xcite , which is a quantum stochastic equation for the kinetics of the dilute bose gas , that describes the behavior and formation of the condensate .",
    "this equation is very difficult to simulate , and therefore various simplifications have been proposed .",
    "particularly interesting results are obtaining by using the so  called quantum boltzmann master equation ( qbme ) which neglects all spatial inhomogeinity of the trapped states @xcite .",
    "although this is an extreme simplification , the ( very much easier ) simulation of the qbme give a good idea of the solutions that the qkme could produce .",
    "in the following , we shall show that the master equation ( me ) which describes the laser cooling problem in the presence of atom  atom collisions can be , in the case of the weak  condensation regime , splitted into two independent parts , one accounting for the collisional effects ( which has the form of the qbme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and another which describes the laser cooling process , and has the form of the me already developed for the case without collisions @xcite .",

    "this means that we consider that the typical energy provided by the collisions is smaller than the oscillator energy .",

    "this section analyzes the case of a one dimensional harmonic trap , and it is mainly devoted to the analysis of the laser cooling into states different that the ground state of the trap @xcite ( the ground  state case in analysed in the next section for the more interesting case of three dimensions ) . the laser  cooling into an excited state of the trap is only calculated in the one  dimensional case , because its analysis becomes very complicated in higher dimensions .",
    "the reason for that is that the ergodic approximation , which we employ in sec .",
    "[ sec:3d ] , is incompatible with the analysis of the cooling in excited states of the trap .    in this section",

    "the collisional processes are much faster than the typical cooling time , and therefore the excited state cooling is completely suppressed .",

    "in this paper , we have analysed the effects of the atom  atom collisions on the colective laser cooling of bosonic gases trapped in an harmonic trap , under the festina  lente condition . in particular , we have studied the case in which the mean  field energy provided by the atom  atom collisions is much smaller than the typical energy of the harmonic trap . under such conditions ,",
    "we have derived the me which describes the system , and observed that such me splits into two parts:(i ) a purely collisional part which has the form of a qbme , and ( ii ) a purely laser  cooling part , which has the same form as the me which describes the laser  cooling in absence of collisions . by using this me , we have simulated the dynamics of the trapped gas for different situations .",
    "first , we have analysed the cooling into an excited state of a one  dimensional trap .",
    "we have observed that the transition from the ideal  gas limit ( in which the atoms are completely condensed into the chosen excited state ) to the case in which the collisions dominate the dynamics , is not trivial , specially when the collisional and cooling time scale are comparable .",
    "in such a case , cooling and collisional processes enter in competition , and new phenomena can appear , as for example unstable population of an excited state followed by abrupt population decays , and non  linear pseudo  oscillations between different trap levels .",
    "we have finally analyzed the laser  cooling into the ground state of an isotropic three  dimensional harmonic trap , by using the ergodic approximation .",
    "we have shown that , although the collisional time is typically much faster than the cooling time scale , the laser cooling allows to transform a bed with a finite temperature into an effective bed with zero temperature .",
    "the laser cooling reduces the chemical potential of the trapped atoms , while the collisions provide the thermalization .",
    "let us finally present important remarks concerning the scaling of our theory , the situation beyond the weak  condensation regime , and the problem of the two- and three  body losses in the trap .",
    "first , we stress that we have presented here the results obtained for @xmath153 only for the reasons of numerical complexity which grows rapidly with @xmath154 .",
    "qualitatively , the same results can be obtained for larger @xmath154 s , and therefore , for lower densities .",
    "in fact , we have observed similar results for @xmath155 in one dimensional simulations .",
    "if we increase @xmath154 by factor @xmath156 , the corresponding density ( for fixed @xmath157 ) decreases as @xmath158 , the three body loss rates as @xmath159 , whereas the trap frequency decreases as @xmath160 , which means that the corresponding cooling time ( to fulfill the _ festina lente _ conditions ) will increase as @xmath161 , i.e. much less than the lifetime due to three - body collisions .    beyond the weak condensation regime , the mean",
    " field energy can not be neglected , and therefore the trap levels are no more the harmonic ones .",
    "this has a two  fold consequence : ( i ) the levels of the trap are non  harmonic , i.e. they are not equally separated , because their energies become dependent on the occupation numbers ; ( ii ) the wavefunctions are different , and in particular the condensate wavefunction becomes broader ( we consider here only the case of repulsive interactions , @xmath162 ) .",
    "the fact that the energy levels are not harmonic any more , complicates the laser cooling , but the use of pulses with a variable frequency and band  width should produce the same results as those presented here .",
    "the point ( ii ) implies that the central density of the interacting gas is much lower than the one predicted for noninteracting particles .",
    "in fact , the ratio between the interacting  gas central density ( in thomas  fermi ( tf ) approximation ) and the ideal  gas central density , goes as @xcite @xmath163 where the central density for the ideal case is given by @xmath164 .",
    "the above result has important consequences , when one considers the problem of three  body collisions , which usually begin to play a role at densities of the order of @xmath165 atoms/@xmath166 .",
    "for example , let us analyse the case of sodium , for which @xmath167 , and @xmath168 nm . from the definition of @xmath154 , @xmath169 .",
    "for the ideal gas case , the regime in which three  body losses are important is reached for @xmath170 . for @xmath171",
    "this means @xmath172 .",
    "amazingly , for the interacting gas , the same is true for @xmath173 , and therefore for @xmath171 , the regime in which three  body losses are important is reached for @xmath174 . below this number ,",
    "the interaction between the particles is dominated by the ellastic two  body collisions considered in this paper . as point out above",
    ", our laser cooling scheme could be extended beyond the weak  condensation regime , and therefore laser  induced condensations of more than @xmath175 atoms are feasible .",
    "concerning other loss mechanisms , we have to mention here the hyperfine changing two - body collisions , or generally speaking any inelastic two - body processes .",
    "these can be supressed completely if we cool atoms into the absolute ground internal state , which is possible in the dipole traps . for alkalis this",
    "is typically done by cooling to the lowest energy state in the lower hyperfine manifold ( external static magnetic fields are used to split the levels within the hyperfine manifold ) .",
    "finally , yet another loss mechanism disregarded here is due to photoassociation , i.e. excitation of molecular resonances .",
    "this kind of loss rates are typically of the order @xmath176 ( where @xmath3 is the linewidth of the auxiliary level @xmath12 , @xmath177 is the laser wavelength , and @xmath67 is the atomic density ) , i.e. allow for achieving about @xmath37 cooling cycles of duration @xmath178 provided the density remains smaller than @xmath179 atoms/@xmath180 .",
    "however , the photoassociation losses can be reduced by several orders of magnitude if the laser is red detuned , and tuned exactly in the middle of the molecular resonances @xcite ( note that this is the detuning respect to the one  photon transitions from the ground states to the state @xmath12 , and not the two  photon detuning ) .",
    "other , possibility , is of course to use a more intense laser tuned below the condon point , i.e. the minimum of the molecular potential .",
