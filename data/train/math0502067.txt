    "we denote by @xmath30 the restricted space of _ conjugacies of the fixed rotation _",
    "@xmath31 , namely the closure of the set of @xmath26-diffeomorphisms of the form @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to see that the sets @xmath30 are disjoint for different @xmath4 and in @xcite , it was proved for a particular manifold @xmath0 that @xmath33 .",
    "we do not know if the inclusion remains strict on any manifold .",
    "anosov and katok proved in @xcite that in @xmath25 the set of weak mixing diffeomorphisms is generic ( contains a @xmath34 dense set ) in the @xmath26 topology .",
    "actually , it also follows from the same paper that the same is true in @xmath30 for a @xmath34 dense set of @xmath29 although the construction , properly speaking , is achieved in the space @xmath25 .",
    "however , @xcite does not give a full description of the set of @xmath4 for which the result holds in @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , the flexibility of the constructions in @xcite comes from the fact that @xmath4 is constructed inductively at the same time as the conjugations are built , that is : at step @xmath35 , @xmath36 is given , and @xmath37 is constructed that commutes with @xmath38 ; then @xmath39 is chosen so close to @xmath40 that @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 and each @xmath37 commutes with @xmath38 ) is sufficiently close to @xmath43 to guarantee the convergence of the sequence @xmath44 .",
    "then step @xmath45 gets started by the choice of @xmath46 etc ... the final @xmath4 is the limit of @xmath47 . by this procedure , there is no need to put any restrictions on the growth of the @xmath48 norms of @xmath5 since @xmath39 can always be chosen close enough to @xmath47 to force convergence .",
    "the counterpart is that the limit diffeomorphism obtained in this way will lie in @xmath30 with @xmath4 having rational approximations at a speed that is not controlled .",
    "since we want to do the construction inside @xmath30 for an arbitrary liouville number @xmath4 , we are only allowed to make use of the fact that the decay of @xmath49 is faster than any polynomial in @xmath50 .",
    "so we have to construct @xmath37 with a polynomial ( in @xmath50 ) control on the growth of its derivatives to make sure that the above procedure converges .",
    "recall that an irrational number @xmath4 is said to be diophantine if it is not too well approximated by rationals , namely if there exist strictly positive constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 such that for any couple of integers @xmath53 we have : @xmath54    in this paper we work in the restricted spaces @xmath55 and prove the following for _ any _ liouville , i.e. not diophantine and not rational , frequency @xmath4 :    [ liouville ] let @xmath0 be an @xmath1-dimensional ( @xmath56 ) differentiable manifold with a nontrivial circle action @xmath57 preserving a smooth volume @xmath3 . if @xmath29 is liouville , then the set of weak mixing diffeomorphisms is generic in the @xmath26 topology in @xmath55 .    on @xmath58 or @xmath12 , the weak mixing diffeomorphisms we will construct in @xmath55 will have @xmath31 as their restriction to the boundary .",
    "this clarifies the relation between the ergodic properties of the area preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath21 and their rotation number on the boundary , complementing the striking result of m. herman stating that if @xmath59 is a smooth diffeomorphism of the disc with a diophantine rotation number on the boundary , then there exists a set of positive measure of smooth invariant curves in the neighborhood of the boundary , thus @xmath59 is not ergodic . by kam theory ,",
    "this phenomenon was known to happen for diophantine @xmath4 as soon as the map @xmath59 displays some twist features near the boundary .",
