    "electromagnetic coupling between optical cavities and nano - mechanical resonators has led to new quantum mechanical behaviour of macroscopic quantum systems @xcite .",
    "substantial experimental progress has been made to realize such novel quantum systems at the single photon level @xcite . at the same time",
    "several theoretical works have appeared in the literature that study a single optical mode coupled to a single mechanical mode , in the strong coupling regime .",
    "quantum effects are found in these hybrid systems if the coupling between the light field and the mechanical resonator becomes much larger than the cavity decay rate and the mechanical oscillation frequency .",
    "quantum nonlinearities can also be introduced into the system by placing a kerr medium inside the optical cavity @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated experimentally that by coupling two optical modes to a mechanical oscillator , the quantum nonlinearity can be enhanced significantly @xcite .",
    "this enhanced nonlinearity has potential application in quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement of phonon number @xcite .",
    "besides qnd measurements , optomechanical systems have potential applications in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the kerr type nonlinearity can form the basis of all optical switch with application to engineer a quantum phase gate for photonic or phononic qubits .",
    "the mechanical mode can also serve as a quantum memory @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom gives rise to a quantum interface between solid - state , optical and atomic qubits @xcite .",
    "optical modes in quantum information processing units can transfer information over long distances and on the other hand acoustic excitations ( phonons ) can store information for an extended period . a hybrid architecture composed of optical modes and mechanical modes",
    "can thus be fruitfully utilized to design a quantum communication and quantum information processing unit which can store and transfer information coherently .",
    "theoretical studies related to two mode system have been performed much in detail @xcite .",
    "given these new developments in this field , in this work , we show that the dynamics of the linearized hamiltonian of the two optical modes coupled to one mechanical mode is equivalent to that of the dicke model @xcite .",
    "we analytically calculate expressions for the normal modes of the system and show that the system can undergo a dicke - hepp - lieb type superradiant phase transition by varying the various coupling constants .",
    "we demonstrate the possibility of selective energy exchange between any two modes .",
    "we also study the squeezing variances of the three modes near the quantum critical point .",
    "we demonstrate the normal mode splitting ( nms ) in the displacement spectrum of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "the optomechanical setup that we consider here ( fig.1 ) is composed of an optical cavity with two optical modes ( denoted by operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and one mechanical mode ( denoted by @xmath2 ) .",
    "this system is described by the hamiltonian @xcite    , @xmath1 and one mechanical mode @xmath2 .",

    "the term @xmath9 denotes the interaction between each of the two optical modes and the mechanical oscillator with coupling rates @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling between the two optical modes via the mechanical oscillator is @xmath11 .",
    "this kind of hamiltonian is found typically in a setup with a membrane in the middle of the cavity @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian results from the space dependence of the cavity mode frequencies .",
    "we are interested in studying the dynamics of fluctuations of the system . to this end , we rewrite the operators @xmath12 and @xmath2 around their mean values as , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mean field values of the optical modes and the mechanical mode respectively whose values are given in the appendix i. as a result , we get an effective hamiltonian for the system after retaining terms which are bilinear .",

    "this is accomplished by the following position and momentum operators for the three bosonic modes .",

    "the position variances @xmath61 and @xmath62 are already squeezed and become more squeezed as @xmath59 approaches @xmath60 .",
    "in contrast , the figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) illustrates that the momentum variances which are initially unsqueezed , appoaches the value @xmath63 and becomes slightly squeezed as the coupling parameters approach the critical value .",
    "the corresponding position variances which are initially squeezed diverges and becomes unsqueezed as the critical point is approached .",
    "thus we conclude that the quadratures which are squeezed are best suited for quantum measurements since squeezed quadratures have reduced quantum noise i.e , if we make quantum measurements while varying @xmath59 , then it would be more appropriate to make measurements of the position quadratures .",
    "on the other hand , while varying @xmath64 or @xmath65,the position quadrature is a better candidate as long as it squeezed . near the critical point ,",
    "measurements on the momentum quadrature would be better suited .",
    "here we show that coupling between the mechanical mode fluctuations and the two cavity mode fluctuations leads to a splitting of the normal mode into three modes ( normal mode splitting ( nms)).the optomechanical nms however involves driving three parametrically coupled nondegenerate modes out of equilibrium",
    ". the nms does not appear in the steady state spectra but rather manifests itself in the fluctuation spectra of the mirror displacement .    using the hamiltonian given by eqn .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) , we get the linearized equations of motion which are represented as follows :    @xmath66a_{1}(t)+ig_{1}(b(t)+b^{\\dagger}(t))- i\\lambda a_{2}(t)+\\sqrt{\\gamma_{c_{1 } } } a_{in_{1}}(t),\\ ] ]    @xmath67a_{2}(t)+ig_{2}(b(t)+b^{\\dagger}(t))- i\\lambda a_{1}(t)+\\sqrt{\\gamma_{c_{2 } } } a_{in_{2}}(t),\\ ] ]    @xmath68    where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "fig.3 shows the displacement spectrum ( @xmath112 ) as a function of dimensionless frequency(@xmath93 ) .",
    "the nms is associated with the mixing between the mechanical mode and the fluctuation of the two cavity field around the steady state .",
    "clearly we see three modes in the displacement spectrum indicating a coherent energy exchange between the mechanical mode and the two optical modes . an important point to note",
    "is that in order to observe the nms , the energy exchange between the three modes should take place on a time scale faster than the decoherence of each mode . on the positive detuning side ,",
    "the observation of nms is prevented by the onset of parametric instability .",
    "the experimental prospects for various parameters used in the main paper are illustrated as follows .",
    "mechanical frequency of optomechanical system can take the value @xmath113 mhz with corresponding damping rate @xmath114 khz @xcite .",
    "high finesse optical cavities can decay with a rate nearly @xmath115 mhz @xcite .",
    "optomechanical crystal setups record a coupling rate of @xmath116 mhz @xcite .",
    "such coupling rates can be enhanced above @xmath117 mhz by using nanoslots @xcite which increases the local cavity field in these structures .",
    "the limit @xmath118 is always taken into account for various optomechanical experiments @xcite .",
    "we have presented how the existence of a quantum phase transition in a hybrid optomechanical system can be exploited to selectively transfer energy between two optical modes and a single mechanical mode . by scanning",
    "one of the three coupling parameters , we can selectively open one channel to transfer energy between any two modes while at the same time close the other two channels . at the quantum critical point a complete transfer of energy is possible between any two modes .",
    "the study on the momentum and position variances tells us that the quadratures which are squeezed are best suited for measurements due to less amount of quantum noise .",
    "the normal mode splitting shows distinct three peaks which again demonstrates that the process of coherent energy exchange between the three modes is possible .",
    "the fact that phononic modes can store energy for a longer duration and photonic modes can transfer energy over long distances makes this hybrid optomechanical system useful in next generation of quantum communications and quantum information processing units .",
    "starting from the hamiltonian of eqn.([ham1 ] ) , we derive the heisenberg equations of motion for the operators @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this yields ,    @xmath122    @xmath123    @xmath124    where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the input noise operators for the two optical modes .",
    "@xmath127 is the noise operator arising from the brownian motion of the mechanical mode .",
