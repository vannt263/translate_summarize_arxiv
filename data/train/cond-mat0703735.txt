    "the meissner effect@xcite , i.e. , the complete expulsion of an external magnetic field when a superconductor is cooled below the critical temperature , @xmath0 , is a fundamental property of the superconductivity .",
    "the ratio between the superconducting characteristic lengths , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( penetration and coherence length , respectively ) , allows for a classification of the superconductors as type - i or type - ii .",
    "the type - i ones ( @xmath3 ) exhibit a complete meissner effect below a critical field .",
    "the existence of impurities , grain boundaries , or simply geometrical effects can , nevertheless , favor the penetration of the magnetic field inside a type - i sample . instead , type - ii superconductors allow intrinsically for the penetration of magnetic field filaments with quantized flux ( vortices ) which form a triangular lattice@xcite .",

    "geometrical barriers for thin flat superconductors were introduced trying to explain the magnetization of high critical temperature superconductors@xcite . in the london limit various other problems such as the behavior of the vortex lattice in a type - ii superconductor strip with current@xcite , the energetics of a vortex near the edge of a thin superconducting film at zero field@xcite , and the study of the bean - livingston barrier@xcite have been considered .    whether or not vortices can be found inside a type - ii superconductor and the density of them",
    "depends on whether the superconductor is field cooled or zero field cooled before applying the magnetic field .",
    "the fact that the number of vortices is not a unique number as a function of temperature and field is related , particularly in mesoscopic superconductors , to the existence of surface barriers for vortex escape and entrance@xcite .",
    "the use of superconducting strips is common in some technological applications .",
    "therefore , the characterization of this type of geometry is necessary for the design of superconducting devices .",
    "the noise generated by the movement of vortices causes loss of coherence in qubits and also affects the sensitivity of devices as the squids@xcite . in a recent work ,",
    "stan _ et al._@xcite have measured the minimum field below which the vortices are completely expelled from bidimensional nb superconducting strips .",
    "the strips are cooled down through the critical temperature in the presence of a magnetic field applied previously .",
    "when the magnetic field is greater than @xmath6 , vortices can be observed by a scanning microscopy hall probe . for lower magnetic fields ,",
    "vortices are completely expelled .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "it makes sense to define two critical fields which are associated with the disappearance of both the energetic stability and metastability of vortices in the center of the strip for decreasing magnetic fields .",
    "while an upper critical field can be obtained simply in terms of ground - state considerations , a careful computation of the surface energy barrier in the determination of the lower critical field is mandatory . in this work",

    "similar expressions for the vortex energy in a strip have been derived in refs . .",
    "the first term corresponds to the nucleation energy of the vortex and the second to the interaction with the screening currents .",
    "equation [ london ] diverges for @xmath13 and is not valid within a distance @xmath2 from the edges .",
    "this is not surprising since it is based on the london approximation which neglects the core of the vortex . from the previous equation two critical fields , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "can be defined . for low magnetic fields",
    "the free energy @xmath16 displays a maximum in the center of the strip .",

    "minimum appears in @xmath13 and a vortex can be placed there in a metastable situation . at a magnetic field",
    "@xmath19 @xmath20 the minimum becomes an absolute minimum of energy . above this field",
    "the free energy of the strip with a vortex is lower than the free energy without vortices .",
    "the fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two possible critical fields for the expulsion of the vortices .",

    "_ count the number of vortices for different values of the magnetic field after cooling down the samples through @xmath0 .",
    "their results show a linear dependence between the number of vortices and the magnetic field for higher fields . for low values of the field",
    "the dependence of the number of vortices with the field deviates from linearity until the vortices are completely expelled from the strip .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is found by extrapolating the linear zone .",
    "the working temperature @xmath25 is mantained close to @xmath0 where the mobility of the vortices allows them to explore the lowest possible energy configurations without getting pinned by impurities .",

    "[ london ] are basically in agreement with each other . for the widest strip @xmath31 ,",
    "the theoretical @xmath15 must be corrected by a factor of three to account for the partial field screening . however , for the narrowest strip , the london theory badly fails .",
    "for example , the theory predicts @xmath32 when the strips are narrower than @xmath33 . for narrow strips with widths of the order of @xmath2 the finite size of the vortex core",
    "can not be ignored which is likely to be the reason behind the failure of the theory and the disagreement with the experimental results .",
    "for this reason we propose to describe the narrow strips using ginzburg - landau theory .",

    "the screening of the magnetic field is weak and the field penetrates almost uniformly so we assume @xmath42 where @xmath11 is spatially uniform . from now on we use the magnetic length @xmath43 and the cyclotron energy @xmath44 as length and energy units .",

    "the position is given in magnetic lengths .",
    "the insets show the superconducting density when the vortices are at the center and on the edge .",
    "we determine @xmath15 by finding the magnetic field at which the gibbs free energies of a system with @xmath64 ( one vortex row ) and @xmath65 ( meissner state ) are equal . after minimizing the ginzburg - landau functional , we found for the narrowest strip a value of @xmath660.372@xmath39 as shown in fig .",

    "the penetration of another vortex row in the strip is not possible . for @xmath64 ( one vortex row )",
    "the diference between wavevectors in the expansion , @xmath67 , establishes the physical distance between vortices in the row , @xmath68 , @xmath69 for example the wavevectors at @xmath15 are @xmath700.815@xmath71 and therefore the distance between vortices is 3.85@xmath72 .",
    "the difference between wavevectors changes with the magnetic field , therefore we have to search for the wavevectors that minimize the functional for every magnetic field .    by varying the values of the wavevectors , but keeping @xmath73 fixed , we can calculate the free energy of one vortex row with respect to the meissner state , @xmath16 , as a function of the vortex row position across the strip .",
    "the variation of the wavevectors keeping their difference constant implies the numerical variation of coefficients and the minimization process turns to be completely numerical . in general for any configuration",
    "the coefficients of the linear combination are different between them and they are equal only when the vortex row is in the center of the strip . the displacement of a vortex row across the strip is associated with a current induced in the strip . in the ginzburg - landau formalism",
    "the existence of current in a superconducting strip with a vortex row increases the vortex linear density@xcite and the distance between wavevectors in the expansion changes .",
    "here we neglect this effect , which is small anyway .",
    "we determine the critical field @xmath14 calculating @xmath16 for various magnetic fields .",
    "@xmath14 is determined by the appearance of a plateau in the free energy in the center of the strip or the reversal of the sign of the second derivative @xmath74 .",
    "we find @xmath750.265@xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ b_0 ] ) . at @xmath14",
    "the distance between vortices is 4.269@xmath72 ( see inset ) . as expected , this distance is greater than that at @xmath15 due to the increasing vortex density at higher fields . at @xmath76",
    "the distance between vortices is reduced to 1.872@xmath72 , but have not disappeared yet due to the presence of the surfaces . for magnetic fields above @xmath39 the vortices merge creating a channel without superconductivity in the center of the strip@xcite .",
    "we also compute @xmath16 for the critical field @xmath15 ( see fig . [ b_s ] ) .",
    "as expected a zero - energy mimimum is obtained in the center of the strip for which the superconducting density is shown in the inset .    0.372@xmath39 and the width @xmath33 .",
    "the position is given in magnetic lengths .",
    "the insets show the superconducting density when the vortices are at the center and on the edge .",
    "[ b_s ] ]    the free energies curves at both fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 show a finite value when the vortices are placed on the edge .",
    "this behavior is different from that predicted by eq .",
    "[ london ] and can be attributed to a correct description of the order parameter in the ginzburg - landau calculation .",
    "the free energy for a vortex on the edge is superior to the one of the meissner state in both cases .",
    "the position of the vortex is associated with the position of the center of its core although the core can be partially inside the strip .",
    "for instance , when the center of the core is exactly placed on the edge of the strip , the vortex has half of the vortex inside the strip and the other half outside ( see insets in figs .",
    "[ b_0 ] and [ b_s ] ) .",
    "we note finally that the free energy as a function of the position of the vortex presents a maximum near the surface for @xmath15 similar to the one obtained in the london approximation@xcite .",
    "if a vortex nucleates at the surface still has to surpass the small barrier before it slides down towards the center of the strip .",
    "we now repeat the calculation of the critical fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 for widths between 3@xmath2 and @xmath33 .",
    "we find the expected behavior of the critical fields for all the widths , namely @xmath77 , as shown in the fig .",
    "[ graph1 ] .",
    "the closest result to the experimental data for the 5@xmath2 strip corresponds to the critical field @xmath15 using the formalism of ginzburg - landau .",
    "this result is compatible with the field cooled measurements of stan et al .",
    "nevertheless , one should not forget that if the magnetic field decreases below @xmath15 the vortices would stay in the strip until the critical field @xmath14 is reached due to the saddle point energy barrier between the vortex solution and the meissner solution .",
    "this barrier avoids the transition between the vortex states and the meissner state despite of the former being energetically favorable . thus , although the ground state for magnetic fields lower than @xmath15 has no vortices , the barrier would keep the vortices inside the strip until the critical field @xmath14 is reached .",
    "a combination of other effects not considered in this work such as thermal fluctuations and defects on the edge would decrease the escape barrier and would favor @xmath15 over @xmath14 also in decreasing fields .",
    "an almost linear behavior for the density of vortices as a function of the magnetic field can be seen in fig .",
    "[ hc1 ] for large values of @xmath11 .",
    "we also find an almost linear behavior for the density of vortices as function of the magnetic field for wider strips and large fields with the exception of small steps produced by the entrance of individual vortex rows ( not shown ) .",
    "the ground state ( solid line ) has no vortices for magnetic fields lower than @xmath15 although , as stated in previous paragraph , the system could evolve in a metastable state ( dashed line ) until @xmath14 is reached .",
    "the arrows signal the region used by stan et al . in their estimation of @xmath6@xcite .",
    "for lower fields we observe a deviation from linearity which also seems to be the case in the stan _ et al .",
    "_ experiment , although the authors attribute this to imperfections or pinning .",
    "we find a density of vortices greater than the experimental data , however the number of vortices expelled from the strip in the experiment is in agreement with the number the vortices expelled in our calculation in the same range of fields .",
    "the differences could be attributed to impurities or defects on the edges which are not accounted for in our simple geometry .     and",
    "@xmath14 , in the ginzburg - landau and london formalisms for different widths of a superconducting strip . the theoretical result of @xmath15 in the ginzburg - landau formalism is the closest value to the experimental value ( solid square ) .",

    "arrows delimit the field range used for the extrapolation of @xmath6 in ref . .",
    "[ hc1 ] ]    finally we would like to note that the results for the critical fields present a similar behavior to the one predicted by london theory . according to london theory the expulsion field , @xmath6 , can be approximated to @xmath78 , where @xmath50 is a constant with a value close to @xmath10 . in our case the same expression applies , but with an exponent for the denominator of 2.216 .",
    "two expulsion critical fields , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , below which metastable and stable vortices , respectively , cease to exist have been determined for infinitely long superconducting strips and widths between 3@xmath2 and 5@xmath2 using ginzburg - landau theory . the expected behavior for the values of the fields",
    "is obtained , always being @xmath79 for this range of widths .",
    "the profile across the strip of the free energy of a vortex for the field @xmath14 presents a flat zone in the center of the strip whereas the one for @xmath15 has a zero - energy minimum for vortices at the center .",
    "the theoretical value of the two critical fields are closer to the experimental one than those obtained in the london formalism .",
    "our value for @xmath15 for a strip with a width of 5@xmath2 is the closest value to the experimental one , as suggested by stan et al.@xcite for wider strips .",
    "an overall agreement between our results for the number of vortices as a function of the field and the experiment is obtained , including the low field deviation from linearity at small values .",
    "if the observed deviation is not due to imperfections or defects , the experimental value for the critical field would be smaller and in closer agreement with our calculations .",
    "finally , one should keep in mind that , in perfect samples free of imperfections , and ignoring temperature effects , the critical field for the expulsion of the vortices should correspond to @xmath14 , at least in decreasing fields .",
