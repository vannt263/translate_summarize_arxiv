    "although interest in spatially homogeneous cosmological models peaked in the early seventies , it was not until the late seventies that a more unified picture of the dynamics of these models developed , following the proper recognition of the role played in the problem by the gauge freedom of general relativity [ 13 ] . since a number of books [ 4,5 ] and review articles [ 69 ] exist which discuss spatially homogeneous cosmology at various levels and from various points of view , it seems appropriate here to emphasize certain aspects of the subject which are not well covered in the literature .",
    "remarkably there is still something new left to say on this topic nearly a decade after its most active period of research .",
    "the present discussion will seek to generalize many concepts which have already appeared in the context of particular symmetry types or special initial data and fit them together into a single unified picture of spatially homogeneous dynamics .",
    "it should be emphasized that although spatially homogeneous cosmological models are usually studied for a ( nearly ) discrete set of parameter values corresponding to the ( nearly ) discrete set of bianchi types [ 1014 ] , both the metric and field equations depend analytically on a 4-dimensional space of essential parameters ( of which at most three may be simultaneously nonzero ) . by varying these parameters continuously , one may deform each of the various symmetry types into each other and thus relate properties of one bianchi type to those of another , the more specialized symmetry types occurring as singular limits of more general types .",
    "lagrangian or hamiltonian techniques enable one to associate a finite dimensional classical mechanical system with the ordinary differential equations equivalent to the spatially homogeneous einstein equations and thus offer a convenient means of visualizing the dynamics and of understanding its qualitative features .",
    "these techniques , which provide the framework of this exposition , were pioneered by misner [ 1518 ] and followed through by ryan [ 1923 ] , leading to an alternative but equivalent description [ 24 ] of the qualitative results obtained by lifshitz , khalatnikov and belinsky [ 2529 ] for the evolution of certain spatially homogeneous cosmological models near the initial singularity using piecewise analytic approximations . this latter work was later confirmed and extended by bogoyavlensky , novikov and peresetsky using powerful techniques from the qualitative theory of differential equations [ 3035 ] .",
    "qualitative studies of various perfect fluid models including the regime away from the initial singularity should also be noted [ 3640 ] .",
    "the present discussion has as its foundation previous papers of the author [ 13 , 4143 ]",
    ". no attempt will be made to review the large body of important work which preceded them .",
    "references [ 49 ] adequately serve this function . in particular the bibliographies of the ryan - shepley book [ 5 ] and",
    "the recent review by maccallum [ 9 ] provide an exhaustive list of relevant research papers .",
    "it turns out that the key to our problem is a simple adage of mathematical physics : whenever a symmetric matrix is encountered , diagonalize it .",
    "first one diagonalizes the symmetric tensor density associated with the structure constant tensor whose components completely determine locally the type of spatial homogeneity .",
    "the three diagonal components plus an additional parameter characterizing the trace of the structure constant tensor are the four parameters referred to above .",
    "next one diagonalizes the component matrix of the spatial metric , maintaining the values of these parameters .",
    "this leads to a decomposition of the gravitational configuration space variables ( namely the component matrix of the spatial metric ) into two sets of three variables , one set parametrizing the diagonal values of the metric component matrix which are readily interpreted in terms of the action of the 3-dimensional scale group ( independent rescaling of the unit of length along orthogonal directions ) and another set specifying the diagonalizing matrix .",
    "this decomposition incredibly simplifies the field equations since the diagonalizing variables correspond to pure gauge directions , reflecting the effect on the metric variables of spatial diffeomorphisms which are compatible with the spatial homogeneity .",
    "scalar functions such as the spatial scalar curvature which are gauge invariant depend at most on some of the diagonal variables , for example .",
    "finally one diagonalizes the dewitt metric [ 44 ] on the configuration space @xmath0 of spatial metric component matrices by choosing an orthogonal basis of the lie algebras of the scale group and of the 3-dimensional group @xmath1 used in the metric diagonalization ; the dewitt metric is important since the",
    " free dynamics \" is equivalent to geodesic motion for this metric .",
    "the advantages of diagonal matrices over general symmetric matrices are obvious ; all matrix operations ( multiplication , determinant , inverse ) become trivial and functions of these matrices have a much simpler dependence on the individual components . diagonalizing a quadratic form kinetic energy function",
    "also greatly simplifies the equations of motion .    a familiar example from classical mechanics which proves useful as an analogy is the problem of the motion of a rigid body [ 45,46 ] .",
    "such an analogy was in fact first introduced for general spacetimes by fischer and marsden [ 47 ] in their original discussion of the role of the lapse and shift in the three - plus - one formulation of the einstein equations .",
    "it is even more appropriate for the spatially homogeneous spacetimes where the correspondence is nearly complete .",
    "the usual synchronous gauge spatial frame is analogous to the space - fixed axes in the rigid body problem .",
    "the  diagonal gauge \" spatial frame which diagonalizes both the spatial metric and the symmetric tensor density associated with the structure constant tensor corresponds to the body - fixed axes which diagonalize the moment of inertia tensor .",
    "the special orthogonal group @xmath2 generalizes to the relevant 3-dimensional diagonalizing matrix group @xmath1 .",
    "since the components of the structure constant tensor must remain fixed under its action , this group is a matrix representation of a subgroup of the special automorphism group of the given bianchi type lie algebra ( the subgroup is unimodular since its lie algebra is required to be offdiagonal ) .",
    "the concept of angular velocity also has an analogue which is closely related to the shift vector field whose associated time dependent spatial diffeomorphism drags the synchronous spatial frame into the diagonal gauge spatial frame by inducing the time dependent frame transformation which orthogonalizes the spatial frame .",
    "however , since the action of @xmath1 on the metric configuration space represents an orbital motion , the situation is more involved .",
    "at this point it is helpful to keep in mind the problem of the nonrelativistic motion of a particle in a spherically symmetric potential ( the central force problem ) . here",
    "the symmetry group @xmath2 is a subgroup of the group of motions of the euclidean metric on the configuration space @xmath3 . by introducing spherical coordinates",
    "one separates the configuration space variables into angular variables describing the orbits of @xmath2 , namely 2-spheres except for the fixed point at the origin where the orbit dimension degenerates , and radial variables which describe the directions orthogonal to the orbits .",
    "the components of orbital angular momentum arise from evaluating the moment function [ 40 ] for the action of @xmath2 on @xmath3 in the standard basis of its lie algebra and may be interpreted as the inner products of the standard basis of rotational killing vector fields with the velocity of the system .",
    "since @xmath2 is a symmetry group of the dynamics , angular momentum is conserved and the problem is then reduced to 1-dimensional radial motion in a new potential , the angular momentum contributing an effective potential ( the centrifugal potential ) to the original radial potential .",
    "when the latter potential is absent , the case of the motion of a free particle , it is of course simplest to consider only radial orbits which lead to the simplest representation of the free ( straight line ) motion , namely geodesics of the euclidean metric .",
    "this restriction to radial orbits is possible because of the additional translational symmetry which allows one to transform the angular momentum to zero .    in spatially homogeneous dynamics",
    "the euclidean metric on @xmath3 is replaced by the lorentzian dewitt metric on the 6-dimensional space @xmath0 of spatial metric component matrices .",
    "the decomposition of the euclidean space variables goes over roughly into the 3-dimensional space of  diagonal \" variables and the 3-dimensional space of  offdiagonal \" variables as described above .",
    "the offdiagonal variables describe the orbits of the action on @xmath0 of the matrix group @xmath1 and the diagonal variables describe the orthogonal directions .",
    "the moment function for the action of @xmath1 on @xmath0 is the analogue of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "its components in a certain basis of the matrix lie algebra @xmath4 of @xmath1 will be seen below to correspond to the space - fixed components of the spin angular momentum in the rigid body analogy , thus neatly intertwining these two classical analogies . the free motion ( geodesics of the dewitt metric )",
    "is most easily represented as purely diagonal , using the larger isometry group @xmath5 of the dewitt metric to transform away the angular momentum associated with any particular subgroup @xmath1 .",
    "the overall scale of the metric matrix represented by its determinant ( product of its diagonal values ) corresponds to the single timelike direction and the free motion is subject to an additional energy constraint requiring the geodesic to be null .",
    "apart from the freedom to rescale and translate the affine parameter of these diagonal null geodesics , there is a 1-parameter family of them , parametrized by the angle of revolution of the 2-dimensional null cone in the space of diagonal metric matrices ; these are the well known kasner solutions [ 48 ] . however , a geodesic which has zero angular momentum for a particular choice of the group @xmath1 will have nonzero angular momentum for almost all other choices of this group .    in the central force problem the separation of radial and angular variables is clean . in our problem",
    "the symmetry group of the free dynamics is @xmath5 and only the corresponding division of variables into a conformal metric ( unit determinant ) and a scale variable ( the metric determinant which parametrizes the orbits of @xmath5 ) is clean .",
    "the division of variables into two orthogonal sets of three diagonal variables and three offdiagonal variables is instead highly ambiguous .",
    "there is essentially a 2-parameter family of subgroups @xmath1 of @xmath5 with 3-dimensional offdiagonal matrix lie algebras whose orbits are almost everywhere transversal to the diagonal submanifold of @xmath0 .",
    "the orbits of any of these subgroups may be used to perform the decomposition , which is automatically orthogonal with respect to the dewitt metric .",
    "the addition to the free system of the spatial scalar curvature as a potential breaks down the @xmath5 symmetry uniquely to one of these subgroups in the general case , although some degeneracy remains in some of the more specialized symmetry types ( bianchi types ii and v ; bianchi type i is the free system and the symmetry remains unbroken ) .",
    "this breakdown of @xmath5 symmetry to a particular subgroup @xmath1 depends continuously on the parameters which specify the lie algebra of the spatial homogeneity group , just as the symmetry breaking scalar curvature potential itself depends continuously on these parameters .",
    "when the subgroup @xmath1 has a compact subgroup , the diagonal / offdiagonal decomposition develops a singularity where the orbit dimension degenerates from its generic value three , similar to the coordinate singularity of spherical coordinates at the origin of @xmath3 .",
    "these points of the configuration space turn out to be associated with additional continuous symmetry of the spatial metric ; they are protected by angular momentum barriers in the same way as is the origin of @xmath3 in the central force problem .",
    "the concept of angular momentum links the rigid body and central force analogies .",
    "the time dependent diagonalizing matrix is a curve in the matrix group @xmath1 , representing the orbital motion of the system .",
    "( in fact the matrix group @xmath1 directly parametrizes the points of each orbit . ) the tangent vector of this curve , namely the velocity associated with the offdiagonal variables , represents the orbital velocity of the configuration space point .",
    "given a basis of the matrix lie algebra @xmath4 of @xmath1 , one determines a corresponding basis of the tangent space at the identity and two global frames on @xmath1 , one left invariant and one right invariant , which reduce to this basis at the identity .",
    "the left and right invariant frame ( contravariant ) components of the velocity tangent vector correspond respectively to the space - fixed and body - fixed components of the angular velocity in the rigid body analogy .",
    "these components are related to each other not by @xmath1 itself as in the previously defined space - fixed and body - fixed components but by the adjoint representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the association of left and right with space and body assumes that the diagonal gauge frame is related to the synchronous gauge frame by a passive transformation , corresponding to a right action of @xmath1 on @xmath0 and since @xmath1 is identified with its orbits this becomes right translation of @xmath1 into itself .    by the local identification of @xmath1 with its orbits in @xmath0 ( the  offdiagonal variables \" ) , one may use the dewitt metric on the orbit to lower the indices of the velocity tangent vector , leading to what are analogous to the space - fixed ( left invariant frame ) components and body - fixed ( right invariant frame ) components of the angular momentum .",
    "thus the frame components of the dewitt metric along the orbit act as the components of the moment of inertia tensor in the rigid body analogy .",
    "the  space - fixed components of the angular momentum \" are the inner products of the left invariant frame vectors with the velocity .",
    "these vector fields generate the right translations and hence the right action of @xmath1 on @xmath0 and are therefore killing vector fields of the dewitt metric .",
    "the space - fixed components of the angular momentum are thus the components of the moment function for the action of @xmath1 on @xmath0 and therefore the components of the orbital angular momentum , which are conserved for the free motion .",
    "note , however , that the body - fixed components are related to these constant components by the adjoint transformation and so are in general time dependent . furthermore , the right invariant frame components of the dewitt metric must be independent of the orbital variables since right translation is an isometry . by properly choosing the basis of @xmath4",
    ", these components may in fact be diagonalized .",
    "one advantage of the present problem over the analogous classical problems is that one is free to reparametrize the time variable by introducing a nontrivial spatially homogeneous lapse function .",
    "lapse functions which depend only on the metric component matrix correspond to conformally rescaling the dewitt metric and the scalar curvature potential .",
    "however , in general the lapse function may also depend on time derivatives of the metric components leading to a much larger freedom in the hamiltonian system ( a freedom not permitted in the lagrangian approach ) .",
    "often special choices other than the usual cosmic proper time are suggested by the dynamics which help to simplify its description .",
    "two such choices are the misner @xmath6-time [ 15 ] related to the logarithm of the metric determinant and his supertime [ 17 ] , where the lapse is simply related to the metric determinant .",
    "the latter choice of time is also crucial to the belinsky - lifshitz - khalatnikov analysis of the dynamics near the initial singularity . for the free dynamics",
    ", they are both affine parameters for the geodesic motion .",
    "of course all of these remarks will become clearer once explicit notation and formulas are introduced .",
    "the result of this formal manipulation is a reduction of the einstein equations to a 2-dimensional hamiltonian system with time dependent potentials associated with the spatial curvature , with the centrifugal forces arising from the  motion \" of the diagonalizing spatial frame , and with the energy - momentum of the source of the gravitational field , here assumed to be a perfect fluid .",
    "this system must be supplemented by the equations of motion of the source of course .",
    "explicit diagrams of the various time dependent potentials are extremely useful in deducing the gross features of the evolution of the metric variables ; near the initial singularity they may be used to construct  diagrammatic solutions \" of the field equations , as done by ryan for the bianchi type ix case [ 20 ] .",
    "the main body of the paper is divided into three sections . in the first of these the parametrized",
    "spatially homogeneous spacetime and field equations are introduced . in the second the parametrized decomposition of the metric variables",
    "is introduced and used to reduce the einstein equations to a 2-dimensional time dependent hamiltonian system .",
    "the potentials of this system are then described in detail . in the third section their qualitative effect on the dynamics",
    "is discussed .",
    "before even beginning to discuss spatially homogeneous spacetimes , it is worthwhile introducing some useful facts concerning the smooth action of a lie group @xmath8 on a manifold @xmath9 as a transformation group [ 4952 ] .",
    "a left action is just a homomorphism @xmath10 from the lie group into the group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath9 , i.e. for @xmath11 the corresponding transformation @xmath12 satisfies under composition @xmath13 . by defining",
    "@xmath14 one obtains an antihomomorphism @xmath15 satisfying @xmath16 which is the defining relation for a right action . when @xmath17 is an isomorphism @xmath18 so that only the identity @xmath19 acts as the identity transformation on @xmath9 , @xmath17 is called an effective action . for example , any lie group acts effectively on itself on the left by left translation @xmath20 and on the right by right translation @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "( note that @xmath23 is an isomorphism and a left action . ) introducing the redundant but useful notation @xmath24 for the transformation @xmath12 acting on @xmath25 , denote the orbit of @xmath26 by @xmath27 , namely all points which can be reached from @xmath26 under the action of the group .",
    "not all of the transformations are effective in moving the point @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the isotropy subgroup at @xmath26 of the action of @xmath8 on @xmath9 , namely the subgroup of @xmath8 which leaves @xmath26 fixed .",
    "intuitively one expects that at least locally the orbit of @xmath26 is in a one - to - one correspondence with the smallest subset of transformations which can move the point @xmath26 arbitrarily on its orbit .",
    "this notion is described by introducing the space @xmath29 of left cosets of the subgroup @xmath30 in @xmath8 , where each left coset @xmath31 is an orbit of the right translation action of @xmath30 on @xmath8 .",
    "all elements of a given coset map @xmath26 to the same point of @xmath9 and elements of different cosets necessarily map @xmath26 to different points as one may easily check .",
    "one can therefore extend the domain of the map @xmath17 from @xmath8 to @xmath32 when acting on @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath33 defines a map @xmath34 which turns out to be a diffeomorphism of the left coset space onto the orbit [ 49 ] . in particular the dimension of the orbit is the difference in dimension of @xmath8 and @xmath30 .",
    "note further that fixing the point in question to be @xmath35 , so a general point of the orbit may be represented by @xmath36 , then the left action of @xmath8 on @xmath9 @xmath37 corresponds to the left translation @xmath38 on the coset space .    in mathematics",
    "any orbit of a transformation group ( therefore diffeomorphic to @xmath39 for some subgroup @xmath40 of @xmath8 ) is called a homogeneous space , since all points of the space are equivalent under the transformation group . here in the context of general relativity , a narrower notion of homogeneous space is required which incorporates not only the equivalence of the points of the space but of the geometry as well . a ( pseudo- )",
    "riemannian space @xmath41 is called homogeneous if it is the orbit of an isometry group ( invariance group of the metric ) , in which case the action is said to be transitive . a simply transitive action is one in which the isotropy group at every point of the single orbit is trivial ( contains only the identity @xmath42 of @xmath8 ) ; in this case the orbit and the group are diffeomorphic and the left action of @xmath8 on @xmath9 corresponds to left translation on @xmath8 . using the diffeomorphism @xmath43 for an arbitrary point @xmath35 of m to pull back the metric from @xmath9 to @xmath8 , one therefore obtains a left invariant metric on @xmath8 .",
    "thus a homogeneous ( pseudo- ) riemannian space with a simply transitive isometry group is equivalent to a left invariant ( pseudo- ) riemannian manifold involving that group .",
    "( for a right action one simply replaces left by right everywhere in the above discussion ; the choice of left or right actions is a matter of convention . )    however , not all transformation groups act transitively and the interesting question about a given action is how the orbits fit together to fill up the entire manifold .",
    "one may introduce an integer - valued function @xmath44 on @xmath9 whose value gives the dimension of the orbit to which each point belongs ; all those orbits of a given dimension form a subspace called a stratum and the partitioning of @xmath9 into the various strata is called a stratification [ 53 ] .",
    "note that it is easy to verify that if @xmath45 and @xmath46 , then @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 , so the isotropy subgroups at different points of a given orbit are all conjugate ( and therefore isomorphic ) subgroups of @xmath8 . since @xmath49 , a decrease in the orbit dimension corresponds to an increase in the isotropy subgroup dimension",
    ".    often the action of a lie group @xmath8 on a manifold @xmath9 describes a symmetry , all points of a given orbit being equivalent in some sense which depends on the context , and one is interested in how things change in the directions  orthogonal \" or ",
    "oblique \" (  transversal \" ) to the orbits .",
    "it is therefore natural to introduce the orbit space @xmath50 ; however , due to the varying dimension of the orbits , this is not a manifold . for nice enough actions one can usually choose a subspace of @xmath9 ( a submanifold with or without boundary or a collection of such subspaces which intersects each orbit only once or finitely many times ) such that its intersection with the ",
    "generic \" stratum of maximum dimension orbits is a submanifold whose tangent space is complementary (  transversal \" ) to the orbit tangent space at each intersection point and hence this submanifold is a local slice for the action on the generic stratum [ 53 ] .",
    "slice \" is very helpful in studying objects which are invariant under the group and seem more complicated when studied on the entire space @xmath9 .    for example , consider the rotations about the @xmath51-axis of @xmath3 .",
    "the group is @xmath52 acting as an isometry subgroup of the euclidean metric on @xmath3 , the orbits are circles centered on the @xmath51-axis and lying in the planes of constant @xmath51 , and the half plane @xmath53 directly parametrizes the orbit space which is a manifold with boundary . on the other hand",
    "the full plane @xmath54 is a manifold intersecting the generic orbits ( circles of nonzero radius ) twice but having the advantage that the projection of all geodesics of the euclidean metric onto this manifold are smooth curves , while those which intersect the @xmath51-axis suffer reflection at the boundary when projected onto the half plane .",
    "it is convenient to use the term  slice \" to refer to either the plane or the half plane .",
    "the spatially homogeneous spacetimes or  bianchi cosmologies \" which are studied here have a 3-dimensional isometry group @xmath8 acting simply transitively on a 1-parameter family of spacelike hypersurfaces ( the orbits ) which provides a natural slicing of the spacetime .",
    "each orbit is a homogeneous riemannian manifold and therefore isometric to a copy of @xmath8 equipped with a left invariant riemannian metric , namely the pullback of the induced spatial metric on the orbit . rather than maintaining the distinction between @xmath8 and each orbit , it is simpler to identify the spacetime manifold @xmath9 with the product manifold @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the real line with natural coordinate @xmath57 which parametrizes the family of copies @xmath58 of @xmath8 in @xmath55 , on each of which @xmath8 acts by left translation .",
    "however , this still leaves open the question of how these left invariant riemannian manifolds fit together into a spacetime and how the left translations on each copy of @xmath8 in @xmath55 fit together into a global action of @xmath8 on @xmath9 .",
    "one needs to describe a threading of this natural slicing by a congruence of curves in the spacetime ( which is nowhere tangent to an orbit ) which will be identified with the @xmath57-lines in @xmath55 , the @xmath57-coordinate on @xmath55 corresponding to a given time function for the slicing .",
    "each such identification leads to a different global reference system based on the same natural slicing of the spacetime . in order for the induced metric on each copy of @xmath8 to be a left invariant metric",
    ", the class of threading congruences must be compatible with the action of @xmath8 on the spacetime .",
    "one threading congruence and slicing parametrization is picked out uniquely by the symmetry , namely the invariant congruence of geodesics orthogonal to the orbits , the proper time along these geodesics measured from some initial orbit serving to parametrize the family of orbits .",
    "identifying this parametrized congruence with the @xmath57-lines of @xmath55 establishes the so called  synchronous reference system \" [ 48 ] adapted to the spatial homogeneity , with the action of @xmath8 on @xmath59 being @xmath57-independent left translation on each copy of @xmath8 .",
    "any other threading of the slicing may then be viewed as a @xmath57-dependent diffeomorphism of the family of copies @xmath60 of @xmath8 in @xmath9 relative to the synchronous threading [ 47 ] . dragging along",
    "the @xmath57-dependent left invariant spatial metric by this diffeomorphism will lead to the @xmath57-dependent spatial metric in the reference system adapted to the new congruence .",
    "this will again be a @xmath57-dependent left invariant metric only if one restricts the spatial diffeomorphism freedom , i.e. restricts the allowed class of threadings , to be compatible with the group structure of @xmath8 .",
    "the compatibility condition is that such diffeomorphisms map the space of left invariant tensor fields on @xmath8 into themselves .",
    "these consist of the left and right translations and the automorphisms of @xmath8 , the latter diffeomorphisms being those which preserve the group multiplication and form a finite dimensional lie group @xmath61 called the automorphism group .",
    "the translations and automorphisms together form a semidirect product lie group [ 51 ] @xmath62 .    before discussing in detail the structure of a spatially homogeneous spacetime",
    ", it is worth understanding first the homogeneous riemannian manifolds from which they are constructed .",
    "these are left invariant riemannian 3-manifolds @xmath63 , where _ g _ is a left invariant riemannian metric on the 3-dimensional lie group @xmath8 . on each lie group",
    "there is a natural identification of the tensor algebra at any given point , say the identity @xmath19 , with the algebra of either left or right invariant tensor fields .",
    "given a tangent tensor at the identity , one can left ( right ) translate that tensor all over the group using the differential of the unique left ( right ) translation which maps the identity to each point of the group , thus obtaining a left ( right ) invariant tensor field which coincides with the original tensor at the identity . in particular , given a basis @xmath64 of the tangent space at the identity and its dual basis @xmath65 of covectors ( satisfying @xmath66 ) , one obtains a global left ( right ) invariant frame @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) and its dual frame @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) of left ( right)invariant 1-forms on the group .",

    "lifshitz and khalatnikov , later joined by belinsky , were led to the qualitative study of spatially homogeneous models by their investigation of the nature of a generic initial cosmological singularity .",
    "it seems that the approach to the singularity in adapted comoving coordinates induces a sort of contraction of the einstein equations which essentially decouples the evolution of the three - plus - one variables at different spatial points while mimicking the behavior of a particular spatially homogeneous model at any given point .",

    ", it is convenient to use the variable @xmath729 which increases towards the singularity . as one approaches the singularity , the  anisotropy \" increases and the scale over which the motion of the @xmath450 variables occurs becomes much larger than the one over which the curvature of the valleys and corners associated with the channels of figure 4 is apparent .",

    "because of the sharp rise of an exponential , a given potential has little effect on the motion of the universe point until a  collision \" or  bounce \" occurs , during which the universe point is significantly affected by the potential and then returns to a state in which that potential has little effect on the motion . again due to the exponential nature of the potentials , essentially only one potential usually affects the universe point at any given time . when no potential exerts a noticable effect on the universe point , the evolution reduces to the free dynamics whose exact solutions are the kasner solutions , characterized by straight line motion in the @xmath258 plane with unit @xmath237-velocity ( a null curve in the flat 3-dimensional spacetime @xmath135 ) .",
    "exact solutions also exist for each of the cases in which only one potential is present .",
    "these may be viewed as scattering problems and used to relate the asymptotic kasner solutions before and after the collision with that potential .",
    "when the velocity of a given potential is constant and timelike ( @xmath237-velocity less than one ) , one can always transform to its rest frame where the problem reduces to an ordinary 1-dimensional scattering problem in a fixed potential at constant energy [ 17 ] .",
    "if the velocity is constant but null , one can transform to null coordinates and solve the problem .",
    "because of the super - hamiltonian constraint , the system trajectory is always a timelike or null curve in @xmath135 except near the point of maximum expansion in bianchi type ix models where the spatial curvature is positive and the trajectory becomes spacelike as it makes the transition from expansion to contraction ( see figure 3 of ref.(17 ) ) .",
    "one must also consider the possibility that the system trajectory is affected by one of the channels , although this becomes increasingly less likely as the scale of the @xmath450 motion increases ( simply because the width of the channel is fixed ) . in this case , referred to as the case of small oscillations by blk and as a mixing bounce by ryan and others , only a qualitative solution exists for the exit of the universe point from the channel [ 15,29 ] , apart from a numerical calculation of a particular open channel mixing bounce [ 5,22 ] .",
    "this case can be complicated by the presence of a centrifugal potential in the channel , as discussed by chitre and matzner [ 65 ] and others [ 40 ] .",
    "misner introduced the extremely useful idea of associating a moving  wall \" with each potential by selecting a particular contour line which marks the point at which the potential has a large enough value to significantly affect the motion of the universe point . for a given potential and a given moment of time in supertime time gauge",

    "this locates the  wall contour \" or simply  wall \" associated with this potential @xmath731 this contour is the one at which a turning point of the motion would occur if @xmath732 were time independent , @xmath628 were constant , all other potentials were zero and the motion were orthogonal to the contour .",
    "in fact since the terms omitted in the super - hamiltonian constraint are positive ( away from the point of maximum expansion in the type ix case ) , the  turning point \" of the orthogonal component of the motion must occur at a smaller value of the potential , namely before the system point can make contact with the wall contour .",
    "( because of the motion of the walls , the  turning point \" may only be an actual turning point in the rest frame of the potential . ) however , this gap between the wall and  turning point \" is on a scale which is usually much smaller than the scale over which the @xmath450 motion is occurring and so provides a useful marker of where a collision occurs between the potential and the universe point .",
    "since @xmath628 is a constant far from the wall contour during a kasner phase , the value of the potential at the wall contour remains fixed and the wall contour coincides with a given contour of the potential , thus moving with the same velocity as the potential .",

    "<S> the einstein equations for a perfect fluid spatially homogeneous spacetime are studied in a unified manner by retaining the generality of certain parameters whose discrete values correspond to the various bianchi types of spatial homogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> a parameter dependent decomposition of the metric variables adapted to the symmetry breaking effects of the nonabelian bianchi types on the  free dynamics \" leads to a reduction of the equations of motion for those variables to a 2-dimensional time dependent hamiltonian system containing various time dependent potentials which are explicitly described and diagrammed . </S>",
    "<S> these potentials are extremely useful in deducing the gross features of the evolution of the metric variables .    </S>",
