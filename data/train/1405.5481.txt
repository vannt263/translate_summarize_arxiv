    "there are two possible explanations for the origin of @xmath2-ray emission from gcs . in one scenario ,",
    "the emission can be interpreted as the collective magnetospheric emission from the whole msp population in the gc ( e.g. venter & de jager 2008 ) .",
    "indeed , the @xmath2-ray spectra of these detected gcs are reminiscent of those measured from the galactic msp population ( e.g. abdo et al .",

    "could also contribute to the observed @xmath2-rays via the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) between relativistic pulsar wind leptons and background soft photons ( bednarek & sitarek 2007 ; cheng et al .",

    "they found that the emission can be characterized by a power law with hard photon index @xmath3 and is unlikely to be contributed from a population of unresolved point sources below the detection limit .",
    "the hard photon index was suggested to be a result of a non - thermal scenario by synchrotron radiation from energetics considerations .",
    "however , the limited statistics did not enable this study to draw a firm conclusion .",

    "data for diffuse x - ray emission from several galactic gcs that has been detected in @xmath2-rays by _ fermi_. the authors excluded 47 tuc in their analysis because less than half of the potential diffuse emission region ( i.e. between one and three half - mass radius @xmath4 ) is covered by the field of view ( fov ) in the adopted datasets .",
    "a previous search for diffuse x - ray emission in the direction of 47 tuc has idenitified an extended feature beyond its half - mass radius and in the direction of proper motion of the cluster ( okada et al .",

    "2009 ) . while these studies were focused on an individual extended feature at a location offset from the center of 47  tuc , we are interested in searching for an isotropic diffuse x - ray component associated with this gc .",
    "being a nearby gc at 4.5 kpc ( harris 1996 ) and a host of a large msp population , 47 tuc is one of the promising targets to search for the diffuse x - ray feature as theoretically predicted ( cf .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "2010 ) . together with the large volume of archival x - ray data",
    ", this motivates a deep search for diffuse emission in an unexplored region outside the core radius @xmath5 of the cluster .    in this letter , we report the results from searching for diffuse x - ray emission associated with 47 tuc in the region from @xmath6 up to @xmath7 from the center .",
    "this selected field can alleviate the problem of potential contamination by the unresolved faint source population ( cf .",
    " 3 ) and allow a region sufficiently large for our search .",
    "to search for faint diffuse x - ray emission from 47 tuc , we made use of archival _ chandra _ data and restricted our analysis on the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) data with an exposure @xmath8  ks .",
    "this limited us to four observations in 2002 ( obsid 2735 , 2736 , 2737 and 2738 ) .",
    "the aim - points of all the four observations are on the s3 chip .",
    "we first reprocessed the data by using ciao ( ver .",

    "inspections on the 0.5 - 7.0 kev lightcurves indicate that two observations ( obsid 2736 and 2738 ) suffered from prominent background flares .",
    "we subsequently performed the good time interval ( gti ) filtering by using the ciao routine lc_clean ( ) . combining all the clean data resulted in an effective exposure of @xmath9  ks .    by inspecting the reprocessed event files , signs of pileup effects",

    "we excluded a rectangular region with a width of 0.5 centered on x7 and a length along the readout direction of the entire chip in subsequent spectrum extraction so as to avoid the contamination of the out - of - time events from the bright source .    to define the region - of - interest ( roi ) ,",
    "we first chose the largest annular region in @xmath12 which is fully contained in the s3 chip . in order to fully utilize the fov",

    "the angular span of this region was chosen such that it lies entirely within the ccd chip in all four observations .",
    "the entire roi in our study was defined by assembling all these adopted regions .    to effectively remove the resolved point sources in the roi",
    ", we took the sky positions in the point source catalog by heinke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and calculated the size of the _ chandra _ point spread function ( psf ) at 1.5 kev with an enclosed - counts fraction ( ecf ) of @xmath14 at the positions of these point sources by using the psf _ python _ module . since heinke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) covers only sources within @xmath15 of 47 tuc , we ran wavdetect in the energy band 0.5 - 7.0 kev to detect sources beyond this region .",
    "these sources were subsequently removed as aforementioned .    after removing all the resolved point sources and excluding the pileup - affected region , we extracted the spectra from individual observations within the entire roi in an energy band of @xmath16  kev .",
    "we began our investigation with a spectral analysis of the x - ray emission from the entire roi .",
    "for tightly constraining the emission properties , we fitted the spectra extracted from all observations simultaneously . since the roi covers a large fraction of the s3 chip , there are limited source - free regions on the chip for extracting the background spectra .",
    "in addition , the peripheral region of the chip could possibly contain the contribution of diffuse x - ray emission that we are searching for .",
    "therefore , we adopted the acis blank - sky event files as the background throughout our study .",
    "we followed the online analysis thread to tailor and reproject the blank - sky background files so as to match the observed datasets .    for judging the background normalization",
    ", we have inspected the source and background spectra individually for each observation in @xmath17  kev . in this band ,",
    "observed data are dominated by particle background . except for the data from obsid  2738 , the estimated background contributions for all other observations are @xmath18 which indicates the particle background normalizations are legitimate .",
    "for obsid  2738 , we noticed a residual background ( @xmath19 ) in this band . for minimizing the systematic uncertainties , we excluded this data in all subsequent analysis .",
    "the response files used in this extended source analysis were commputed by weighting the flux contribution from each pixel with the aid of a detector map .",
    "for all the spectral analysis , we fixed the column absorption at @xmath20 which was deduced from the foreground reddening @xmath21 ( harris 1996 ; predehl & schmitt 1995 ; cardelli et al .",
    "we first fitted the spectra using an absorbed power law ( pl ) model in a form of @xmath22 , where the free parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the normalization in unit of photons  kev@xmath25  @xmath26  s@xmath25 at 1  kev and the index of the photon flux respectively .",
    "the best - fit yields a photon index of @xmath27 .",
    "however , we noticed that the goodness - of - fit is not desirable .",
    "we have also attempted to fit the data with a thermal plasma model which includes the contribution from the metal lines ( xspec model : mekal ) .",
    "but we found this model also results in a poor goodness - of - fit . on the other hand , by adding a mekal component to the pl model , a reasonable description of the observed data can be obtained ( @xmath28 for 415 d.o.f . ) .",
    "this composite model yields a photon index of @xmath29 and a plasma temperature of @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31-test indicates that the pl+mekal model is favored over a single pl or a single mekal model at a confidence level @xmath32 .",
    "the energy spectrum of the entire roi with the pl+mekal model fit is shown in figure  [ roispec ] .    in order to estimate the contribution from unresolved point sources in the roi",
    ", we constructed the cumulative luminosity function by using the luminosities of the sources within @xmath5 in 0.5 - 6  kev reported by heinke et al .",
    "fitting the distribution with a functional form of @xmath33 , we obtained @xmath34 and @xmath35 . with a putative detection limit of @xmath36 erg s@xmath25 ( heinke et al .",
    "2005 ) , we integrated the source density in the 0.5  6.0 kev energy range to obtain a luminosity of @xmath37 erg s@xmath25 within @xmath38 . for estimating their contribution in our roi , we adopted a radial source density with a form of : @xmath39^{(1 - 3q)/2}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is a normalization factor and @xmath41 is the best - fit value obtained by heinke et al .",
    "the expected luminosity of the unresolved point sources can then be estimated by @xmath42 erg s@xmath43 erg s@xmath25 . to compare with this value , we calculated the measured luminosity in the same energy range to be @xmath44 erg s@xmath25 for the pl+mekal model . therefore , we conclude that the contribution from unresolved point sources to the observed emission is negligible",
    ".    to quantify the distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission as an angular distance from the center of the cluster , we divided the roi into five concentric annular regions ( rings ) .",
    "the sizes of each ring were chosen to obtain the spectral parameters with comparable relative errors in each ring .",
    "the fitting results of all rings are summarized in table  [ fitrings ] . to obtain a surface brightness profile , we integrated the best - fit models for each ring over the energy band 0.5  7.0 kev and divided the unabsorbed flux by the corresponding solid angle of the extraction region .",

    "the best - fit for the total brightness yields @xmath49 and that for the pl component gives @xmath50 , which are compatible within uncertainties . on the other hand , the best - fit constant levels for the total brightness and the pl component",
