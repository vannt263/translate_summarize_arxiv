    "sources that only mildly exceed the critical rate ( @xmath67 a few ) have a curved , thermal spectrum consistent with a non - standard accretion disk ( slim disk models : @xcite ) , with characteristic inner - disk temperatures @xmath68@xmath69 kev and a flatter radial temperature profile . at higher accretion rates ,",
    "the x - ray spectra of most ulxs show a slightly curved broad - band component dominating the 110 kev band , with an additional thermal component ( soft excess ) at @xmath700.30 kev .",
    "the origin of both components is still disputed .",
    "the broader component could come either from the inner part of the non - standard accretion disk , or from inverse - compton scattering of the inner disk emission in a warm ( @xmath71kev ) , optically thick corona @xcite ; the softer emission might come from a radiatively driven outflow , launched near or just outside the spherization radius @xcite , or also from the disk @xcite .",
    "the broad - band continuum becomes steeper , with a characteristic downturn at lower energies ( @xmath72 kev ) for sources seen at higher inclination angles , probably because the x - ray photons in our line of sight pass through and are downscattered by a thicker disk wind ( soft ultraluminous regime : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead ,",
    "ulxs seen at low inclination angles have a harder spectrum ( hard ultraluminous regime ) , consistent with the interpretation that higher - energy photons emitted in the innermost part of the inflow can emerge from the low - density polar funnel with less downscattering .",
    "this scenario is consistent with numerical and theoretical models of massive radiatively - driven outflows in the super - critical regime @xcite .",
    "two rare subclasses of ulxs remain hard to explain with the super - eddington stellar - mass bh scenario .",
    "the first case is that of `` hyperluminous '' x - ray sources , that is those very few ulxs ( most notably , eso243@xmath7349 hlx-1 : @xcite , and m82 x41.4@xmath7460 : @xcite ) that reach @xmath75 erg s@xmath6 , two orders of magnitude higher than the eddington limit of an ordinary @xmath76 bh . for those sources ,",
    "an intermediate - mass bh with @xmath77 is the most likely explanation .",
    "the hyperluminous subclass is outside the scope of this work .",
    "the second unexplained subclass , which we discuss in this paper , is that of `` supersoft '' ulxs @xcite , henceforth referred to as ultraluminous supersoft sources ( ulss ) .",
    "a purely empirical definition of uls is a source that is dominated by soft , blackbody - like emission with a hardness ratio ( m@xmath73s)/t @xmath78 ( where s , m and t are the _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ count rates in the 0.31.1 kev , 1.12.5 kev and 0.37.0 kev bands ) , and that has reached an extrapolated bolometric luminosity of the thermal component @xmath79 erg s@xmath6 in at least one observation . the best - known representatives of this group have been detected in m101 @xcite , m81 @xcite , m51 @xcite , ngc300 @xcite , ngc4631 @xcite , ngc247",
    "@xcite and the antennae @xcite . a detailed study of the common properties of this whole group of ulss is presented in a companion paper @xcite . in this paper , instead , we focus mostly on the m101 uls ( often referred to in the literature as m101 ulx-1 or cxoj140332.3@xmath74542103 ) , which has arguably the most extensive x - ray coverage among the uls population .",
    "the dominant thermal component of uls spectra has colour blackbody temperatures @xmath80@xmath81 ev ( hence , very little emission @xmath82 kev ) , often varying from observation to observation .",
    "the characteristic blackbody radii are @xmath83@xmath84 km .",
    "blackbody - model bolometric luminosities reach @xmath2 a few @xmath85 erg s@xmath6 , although for such low temperatures , luminosity estimates have to be taken with great caution .",
    "it is well known @xcite that in local group supersoft sources , simple blackbody fits tend to overestimate the bolometric luminosity and underestimate the temperature , compared with white dwarf atmosphere models .",
    "it was also recently found @xcite , via x - ray grating spectroscopy , that the spectra of local group supersoft sources are far richer in absorption and emission lines than previously thought .",
    "unfortunately , for extragalactic ulss , the count rate is too low for grating spectroscopy , and their physical properties have to be inferred from ccd - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "several models have been proposed for ulss .",
    "one suggestion @xcite was that they are powered by intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs ) in a disk - dominated state .",
    "one problem of this scenario is that the observed colour temperatures are very low , often dipping below 100 ev .",
    "a standard disk reaches a peak temperature @xmath86 ev @xcite , where @xmath87 is the bh mass in units of @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity is @xmath89 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "usually , an accreting bh is in a disk dominated state only for @xmath90 @xcite ( canonical high / soft state ) , or more generally for @xmath91 if we also include the non - standard disk regime near the eddington limit .",
    "combining this limit on @xmath66 with the previous expressions for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , it is easy to show that bhs are expected to be in a disk - dominated state only in a specific region of the temperature - luminosity plane , namely for @xmath94 as discussed in a companion paper @xcite , ulss fall mostly outside of that region of parameter space . therefore , a disk - dominated imbh model is in most cases not self - consistent , although we can not rule out the imbh scenario a priori for all sources .",
    "alternatively , ulss are extreme examples of quasi - steady surface - nuclear - burning white dwarfs in close binary systems , by analogy with ( less luminous ) supersoft sources in the milky way and local group @xcite .",
    "the characteristic blackbody radii of ulss are a few times larger than white dwarf radii .",
    "however , that is not inconsistent with the accreting white dwarf scenario : as the luminosity produced by shell burning reaches and exceeds the eddington limit for a white dwarf ( @xmath95 erg s@xmath6 ) , we do expect envelope expansion and/or an optically thick outflow @xcite .",
    "recurrent novae ( also powered by nuclear burning on an accreting white dwarf ) are known to exceed the eddington limit in their outbursts : rs oph reached @xmath96 erg s@xmath6 and remained super - eddington for at least two months during its 2006 outburst @xcite .",
    "a third explanation for ulss is that they are stellar - mass bhs or neutron stars accreting strongly above their eddington limit , so that the central x - ray source is completely shrouded by a massive radiatively - driven outflow .",
    "the x - ray photons from the inner disk are downscattered and thermalized in the compton - thick wind , and we are seeing the photosphere of the outflow @xcite .",
    "mildly super - eddington accretion is now the generally accepted explanation for the vast majority of standard ulxs . in this scenario ,",
    "ulss are the extreme end of the general ulx population , when viewed through the thickest winds ( corresponding to a combination of highest accretion rates and sufficiently high viewing angle ) .",
    "recent multiband studies of the m101 uls @xcite seemed to provide the solution for the nature of ulss .",
    "however , such results have also posed some new unanswered questions : in particular , whether or not the soft emission is coming from a standard accretion disk , and if so , why it is so cold . in this paper , we discuss whether there is an alternative interpretation , that can better explain its x - ray spectral properties and high luminosity .",
    "the _ chandra _ position of the m101 uls is r.a .",

    "@xmath97 @xmath7454@xmath1012102.8 . henceforth , we assume a cepheid distance of 6.4 mpc to m101 ( @xcite : @xmath102 ( random ) @xmath103 ( systematic ) mpc ) . for comparison ,",
    "a distance of 6.9 mpc @xcite was instead adopted by @xcite . from their optical spectroscopic study , @xcite concluded that the m101 uls contains a bh with mass @xmath104 , accreting from a wolf - rayet star of current mass @xmath105 ( initial mass @xmath106 ) , in a binary system with orbital period @xmath107 days . with these parameters ,",
    "the donor star is underfilling its roche lobe : as a result , the system must be powered by wind accretion . in turn , this poses severe lower limits to the bh mass , in order for enough mass to be intercepted by the bh ( @xmath108 for a non - spinning bh ) . in such conditions ,",
    "the m101 uls can not be a persistently super - eddington source : in @xcite s model , the accretion rate reaches only @xmath109",
    "yr@xmath6 : this is barely viable if the long - term - average bolometric luminosity of the bh is @xmath110 erg s@xmath6 , as opposed to a luminosity @xmath111 erg s@xmath6 reached during bright states .",
    "the supersoft thermal component is interpreted by @xcite as optically - thick disk emission , directly observed without any reprocessing in a hot corona .",
    "the main benefit of attributing the soft thermal emission directly to the disk is that this scenario can explain the luminosity variability between high- and low - flux epochs .",
    "the stellar wind itself can not change by two orders of magnitude over few weeks ; however , if accretion is mediated by a disk , thermal / viscous instabilities may give rise to the observed spectral transitions .",
    "this introduces two additional constraints on the bh mass .",
    "firstly , the disk can not form in a wind - accreting system unless the circularization radius of the captured wind is larger than the innermost stable circular orbit : for this to occur , the bh mass must be @xmath112 or @xmath108 , depending on which stellar wind model is adopted @xcite .",
    "secondly , a standard accretion disk is in the thermal dominant state only below @xmath113% of the eddington luminosity , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath114 @xcite . coupled with the inferred bolometric luminosity in the bright states , this constraint on the eddington ratio requires the bh mass to be @xmath112 , possibly inconsistent with a stellar origin of the bh .",
    "finally , no stellar - mass bh has ever been observed with a pure disk spectrum at temperatures @xmath115 kev : as @xcite note , their own interpretation of this uls challenges standard models of bh accretion and disk structure .",
    "considering the unsolved problems of the disk scenario , it is worth re - examining alternative explanations for the supersoft thermal component , which we will discuss in this paper .",
    "m101 has been observed by many x - ray missions over the years . for this paper , we have chosen to re - analyze the 25 _ chandra _ observations , from 2000 march  october and 2004 january2005 january , and the two _ xmm - newton _ observations from 2004 july and 2005 january .",
    "all of them are available on their respective public archives .",
    "there is also another _ xmm - newton _ observation from 2002 june in which the source is barely detected at 3-@xmath116 level @xcite but with insufficient signal - to - noise ratio to provide any useful spectral or colour information ; therefore , we did not use the 2002 june observation in this paper .",
    "the uls was also previously detected in three of the 12 _ rosat_/high resolution imager observations taken between 1992 and 1996 ( source h32 in @xcite ) ; however , the combined number of counts from those three ( short ) observations is only @xmath117 .",

    "we used xspec version 12.6 @xcite for spectral fitting , both for _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. for models involving pileup ( see section 4.3 ) , we also double - checked the results with the spectral fitting package isis @xcite , and found them consistent within the 90% uncertainties .",

    "this is another strong argument against an imbh disk model for this uls .    instead ,",
    "high rms variability ( up to @xmath13950% ) and an increase in rms variability at higher energy bands are two characteristic properties of ulxs in the soft - ultraluminous regime @xcite .",
    "this has been interpreted as due to variable obscuration of the hard inner - disk emission by a clumpy disk wind , for ulxs seen at high inclination angle .",
    "based on this analogy , we speculate that the m101 source and other ulss might be an extreme case of the soft - ultraluminous regime . in this scenario , ulss could be super - critical accreting sources in which a clumpy outflow almost completely masks and reprocesses the harder emission from the central regions .",
    "the outflow must have an even higher optical depth than in the soft - ultraluminous sources discussed by @xcite .",
    "we will outline a possible analytic model for such an outflow in section 5.2 . in most epochs ,",
    "there is either no significant detection in the hard band ( 1.57 kev ) , or it is consistent with a count rate @xmath155 ct s@xmath6 .",
    "significant spikes in the hard flux are seen ( figures 1,2 ) during the strongest soft flares of obsid 934 ( 2000 march 26 ) and obsid 4737 ( 2005 january 1 ) . on both occasion",

    "we will also discuss whether the hard flares are an additional physical component , or are the wien tail of the supersoft thermal component , or are entirely due to photon pileup , which is known to be significant at count rates @xmath156 ct s@xmath6 .",
    "+   +     +   +     +   +      all spectra are dominated ( figures 3,4 and appendix a ) by a soft thermal component with a characteristic temperature @xmath157 kev , therefore with a peak flux at photon energies @xmath158 kev , at the lowest energy range of the _ chandra_/acis - s and _ xmm - newton_/epic detectors .",

    "the best - fitting simple power - law model for the stacked faint - state spectrum has @xmath159 for 12 degrees of freedom , while adding an @xmath250-ev blackbody component significantly improves the fit down to @xmath160 for 10 degrees of freedom . in this section ,",
    "we discuss our interpretation of the supersoft thermal continuum , which is the main focus of this work . in section 4.3",
    ", we will discuss evidence and interpretations for the harder components . because of the very low temperature of the thermal emission , we find ( unsurprisingly ) that it is impossible to distinguish between a disk - blackbody and a single - temperature blackbody model .",
    "we are seeing only the wien part of the thermal spectrum , which is almost identical in the two models .",
    "the only difference is that for each spectrum , the fitted colour temperature in the disk - blackbody model is slightly higher than the corresponding simple blackbody temperature ( cf .",
    "tables 3 and 4 , and model 4 versus model 5 in table a1 ) , because of the slightly different way temperatures and normalization are defined in the two models .",
    "we verified that blackbody and disk - blackbody models are statistically equivalent for every epoch .",
    "for the rest of the paper , unless specifically indicated , we will use radii and temperatures from the blackbody fits , to allow a direct comparison with the outflow model .",
    "our fits show that the bolometric luminosity is always @xmath161 erg s@xmath6 except for the faint state ( tables 3 , 4 ) . in the faint state ,",
    "the extremely low temperature of the soft component makes it impossible to estimate a reliable bolometric luminosity ( most of the emission being in the far - uv ) , but we can not rule out ( table 3 ) that it is also consistent with @xmath161 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "in fact , despite the huge differences ( three orders of magnitude ) in the observed x - ray count rates , all observations are consistent with a blackbody bolometric luminosity varying only within a small range of values , between @xmath2 310 @xmath162 erg s@xmath6 . we have already mentioned ( section 1 ) that such bolometric extrapolations in supersoft sources may overestimate the true luminosity . even if that is the case ,",
    "the general significance of our result is that the large difference in x - ray count rates between `` bright '' and `` faint '' states is mostly due to changes in the blackbody temperature , causing the thermal component to slip out of the detector sensitivity .",
    "we suggest that this is analogous to the well - documented behaviour of some classical supersoft sources , which can switch between a uv - bright phase ( when the optically - thick envelope expands and cools ) and an x - ray - bright phase ( when the radius of the envelope decreases and its photospheric temperature increases ) @xcite .",
    "we find no significant trend of the bolometric luminosity versus fitted temperature or radius , which is to say that @xmath1 roughly scales as @xmath163 ( as shown in more details in section 5.3 ) .",

    "for example , we verified that the non - equilibrium photo - ionization model _",

    "thus , with the data at hand , we have no empirical elements to decide between collisionally ionized and photo - ionized gas .",
    "moreover , at moderately low signal - to - noise ratio and ccd spectral resolution , a phenomenological line - emission model can mimic a more physical model consisting of a smooth emission component above 1 kev ( for example an inverse - compton tail , or direct emission from the inner accretion disk ) with a series of absorption edges ( redshifted and blueshifted if the outflow is relativistic , as in the case of ss433 ) imprinted by the dense outflow @xcite .",
    "in fact , the fast variability of the hard excess , appearing and disappearing sometime within a few 1000 s , is more likely to be caused by variable occultation of an inner compact source of hard x - ray photons emerging through a clumpy wind . in this scenario , we speculate that the m101 uls may have a pure supersoft blackbody spectrum when all the hard x - ray photons from the inner disk / corona are completely absorbed and reprocessed in an optically thick outflow ; instead , it may show a harder tail at epochs when some of the hard x - ray emission emerges through the outflow ( as is likely the case in the soft - ultraluminous regime of ulxs : @xcite ) .",
    "the 2000 mar 26 observation could be an example of a transition between a uls regime ( blackbody component at @xmath255 kev and no hard tail ) , and a two - component soft - ultraluminous ulx regime . on the other hand ,",
    "thermal plasma emission may also come from regions of the clumpy outflow that are just outside the photosphere , or when our line of sight is such that the outflow is not completely optically thick .",
    "for obsid 934-high , we tested whether an inverse - compton component is consistent with the harder part of the emission tail .",

    "the electron temperature @xmath287 in the comptonizing medium is not well constrained , because we do not have enough counts to detect a high - energy rollover ; we arbitrarily fixed it at 4 kev , but any other choice of @xmath288 kev does not change the results of the fit . the scattering optical depth @xmath289 is @xmath290 , but its upper limit is not constrained . table a2 and a3 show that a comptonization component provides as good a fit as a hot thermal plasma component .",
    "regardless of the uncertainty on the physical origin of the hard excess , we stress that the main objective of this paper is to compare the characteristic radii , temperature and bolometric luminosities of the supersoft component with the predictions of a phenomenological outflow model .",
    "the fitted values of such quantities are robust and not strongly dependent on the first - order corrections due to residual harder components .",

    "this is inconsistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not self - consistent even within an imbh scenario , because we do not expect an accreting bh to be in the high / soft state at such low eddington ratios ( see equation 1 ) , without a harder power - law component .    finally , it is clear that the fitted value of @xmath291 in the various observations is not consistent with being constant ( table 3 ) , as should be for a disk in the high / soft state .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that there is also no @xmath300 trend in the fitted distribution of temperatures and luminosities .",
    "there is instead an anticorrelation @xmath301 between fitted radius and temperatures ( either in the blackbody or disk - blackbody model ) , which is more consistent with an expanding or contracting photosphere .",
    "we are aware that none of those arguments is conclusive on its own .",
    "there are bhs in the high / soft state bhs that do not follow the @xmath300 relation ( _ e.g. _ , lmc x-1 : @xcite )",
    ". this may be due to changes in the disk atmosphere , causing changes in the hardening factor @xcite , instead of changes in the innermost radius of the disk . nonetheless , when taken together , the lack of a standard disk track , the low luminosity for a high / soft state , and the high short - term variability make the standard disk interpretation very problematic for the m101 uls .",
    "it was also shown @xcite that this source is not a lone exception : several other ulss share similar properties , suggesting that the standard disk interpretation is not viable for the whole uls class .",
    "given the serious problems of the standard disk interpretation ( both in the stellar - mass and imbh scenarios ) , we now examine the alternative possibility that the thermal emission in ulx-1 and other supersoft ulxs comes from the photosphere of a radiatively - driven outflow launched from an accretion disk in the super - eddington accretion regime . here , we follow and then extend the analysis of @xcite , and we refer the readers to that paper for more detailed discussion of the outflow parameters .",
    "@xcite define and solve a system of five equations for the outflow .",

    "this simplifies the integration in equation ( 4 ) and gives @xcite : @xmath313    inside the thermalization radius , photons are in thermal equilibrium with the gas ; beyond @xmath309 , they are decoupled , in the sense that they are no longer absorbed and re - emitted ( they can still scatter multiple times ) . another characteristic radius of the outflow is the photon trapping radius @xmath314 : inside @xmath314 , photons are advected with the flow ( diffusion timescale longer than the expansion timescale ) .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , if the gas outflow is such that @xmath315 , the colour temperature of the photon spectrum observed at infinity is the temperature at the thermalization radius : @xmath316",

    "it is interesting to note that the most luminous standard ulxs within distances @xmath393 mpc reach x - ray luminosities of a few @xmath394 erg s@xmath6 @xcite , while the m101 uls ( and other ulss : @xcite ) reach luminosities of only a few @xmath162 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "we speculate that the upper envelope of total power output in ulss corresponds to the upper envelope of luminosities in standard ulxs , after accounting for the reprocessing of a larger fraction of x - ray photons in the thicker outflow .",
    "another self - consistency check is required before we can use this outflow model .",
    "the thermalization radius must be larger than the launching radius ( equations 17 and 14 , respectively ) .",
    "( note that the physical thermalization radius is @xmath245 times larger than the `` apparent '' blackbody radius derived from spectral fitting : see equation 17 ) . substituting into the solution for @xmath309 ,",
    "this requires : @xmath395 for the first set of parameters discussed above ( @xmath365 and @xmath344 ) , this condition is satisfied for @xmath396 . for the alternative set of parameters ( solar abundance and @xmath374 ) ,",
    "it is satisfied only for @xmath397 .",
    "however , our calculations were done assuming a spherically symmetric outflow and a schwarzschild bh in the definition of spherization and launching radius . in practice",
    ", the outflow will be thicker closer to the equatorial plane ; therefore a lower @xmath66 will be required to create an optically thick photosphere viewed from high inclination angles .",
    "as for the effect of bh spin , it is straightforward to solve the equations again for @xmath398 with @xmath399 , and verify that for fixed @xmath66 and decreasing @xmath400 , @xmath401 scales approximately as @xmath402 , and condition ( 27 ) is easier to satisfy .",
    "the general physical significance of this model is that for any given line of sight , as the mass inflow rate and , as a result , also the outflow rate increase , at some point the wind will become effectively optically thick ( as opposed to just optically thick to scattering ) and will develop a thermalization surface . when that happens , the inner region of the inflow is shrouded by a photosphere ( effective optical depth @xmath82 ) which completely blocks our view of the inner disk / corona structure and makes the system look like a simple blackbody emitter with no high - energy tail .",
    "we used a spherical approximation for the wind in our model .",
    "we are aware that in reality , the outflow can not be spherical , because it is launched from the accretion disk ( among other reasons ) : for a fixed @xmath66 , the thickness of the wind will be higher for high - inclination line - of - sights , and lower when a source is seen more face - on , or even down the polar funnel , where the outflow is very tenuous and radiation escapes freely .",
    "conversely , the higher the inclination , the lower the value of @xmath66 required to make the wind effectively optically thick . nonetheless , we believe that a simple spherical approximation is useful to highlight the physical concept ( in the same sense that a spherical approximation is used to define the eddington accretion rate ) , and to estimate at least a characteristic order of magnitude for the accretion rate at which the wind at intermediate viewing angles is likely to become effectively optically thick . besides",
    ", for accretion rates as high as those discussed here ( @xmath403 a few 100 ) , the polar funnel is predicted to be quite narrow and the outflow is likely to cover most of the @xmath404 solid angle around the bh .",
    "for example , it was proposed by @xcite that the half - opening - angle @xmath405 of the polar outflow scales as @xmath406 .",
    "the viewing - angle dependence on a ulx apprearance was already extensively discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectra of obsid 934-high and obsid 4737 might be a transitional stage between the supersoft regime and the standard ulx regime ( soft thermal component plus high - energy tail carrying most of the flux ) , as the photospheric radius seen along our line of sight shrinks to the point where we start getting a direct view of harder photons emitted closer to the bh .",
    "photospheric temperatures @xmath407 kev may be the threshold between the two regimes .",
    "an important feature of our spectral fits , reproduced by the outflow model , is that the bolometric luminosity is @xmath408 erg s@xmath6 even in the x - ray faint states .",
    "if accretion is radiatively efficient , this requires a long - term - average accretion rate @xmath139 a few @xmath409 yr@xmath6 , which is probably already too high to be consistent with wind accretion , advocated by the @xcite model .",
    "in fact , in our photosphere model , accretion is highly super - eddington ( @xmath403 a few 100 ) and therefore less efficient .",
    "if the radiative efficiency of super - eddington accretion flows scales as @xmath410 , the required mass accretion rate at infinity is @xmath2@xmath411 yr@xmath6 .",
    "the bh ss433 is the only system in our galaxy known so far that reaches such huge accretion rates @xcite .",
    "such mass tranfer rates can occur over the thermal timescale or nuclear timescale of massive donor stars in their late stages of evolution @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that a 10-@xmath7 bh can be fed by a massive donor ( @xmath412 ) in the short - lived hertzsprung gap phase , reaching a roche - lobe overflow rate of @xmath413 yr@xmath6 ( @xmath414 ) .",
    "crucially , such high accretion rates require that the donor star fills its roche lobe .",
    "this is not the case for the orbital parameters measured by @xcite .",
    "if their claimed orbital period of @xmath415 days ( based on radial velocity measurements of the he @xmath4164686 emission line ) is confirmed by future observations , our super - eddington outflow model is all but ruled out .",
    "conversely , we suggest that the empirical measurement of the orbital period may be incorrect , and the true period may be @xmath4173 days , so that the donor star does fill its roche lobe .    one reason why we are not entirely convinced about the value of the period claimed by @xcite is that the he emission was assumed to originate mainly from the wolf - rayet secondary with little contribution from the accretion disk . however , we do not know whether , or how much , the observed emission line is contaminated by emission from the hot gas inside the bh roche lobe ( outer disk , outflow , accretion stream , hot spot ) .",
    "multiple variable contributions to he emission are seen in other ulxs @xcite , and have prevented dynamical mass measurements @xcite .",
    "rapid , stochastic changes in the outflow density and temperature can easily change the x - ray luminosity ( as shown by the rapid variability in the _ chandra _ observations ) and the irradiating flux , and hence change the relative contribution of different he components .",
    "another reason why we need to be cautious about the period measurement is that the sampling of radial velocities presented by @xcite is very sparse and does not even include a complete cycle .",
    "two unrelated velocity dips around day 0 and day 90 ( fig .  2 in @xcite ) , perhaps due to a contaminating component of he , could explain the data equally well . with the current sampling ,",
    "it is impossible to rule out periods smaller than 3 days ( which would allow the donor star to fill its roche lobe ) or longer than 100 days .      one of the main predictions of our model is that when a uls is fainter in the soft x - ray band , it must be brighter in the uv .",
    "the dimmest observations in which a thermal component is significantly detected show a characteristic blackbody temperature @xmath250 ev ( @xmath2600,000 k ) and a characteristic radius @xmath2100,000 km .",
    "this is the case not just for this particular uls in m101 , but also for most other ulss @xcite . at even lower temperatures ,",
    "ulss are simply impossible to detect with _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ ; however , in those cases , can the optically thick photosphere be directly detected in the uv band , for example with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) ? assuming a reddening @xmath418 ( roughly corresponding to the line - of - sight @xmath419 @xmath166 ) , @xmath420 ev , @xmath421 km at the distance of m101 , the observed flux density at 2372.8   ( effective wavelength of the f225w filter on _ hst _ s wide field camera 3 ) is @xmath422 jy .",
    "this would result in a count rate of only @xmath20.02 electrons s@xmath6 ; it would take an impossible 44,000 s to reach a signal - to - noise ratio of 7 .",
    "the same blackbody spectrum gives a flux density @xmath423 jy in the b band , corresponding to @xmath424 mag ( again , currently undetectable ) .",
    "besides , such low optical fluxes are swamped by the optical emission from the outer part of the accretion disk and the donor star ; in the case of the m101 uls , the observed optical counterpart has a v - band flux density @xmath425 jy ( @xmath426 mag : @xcite )",
    ".    there is , however , a possibility that at some epochs the photosphere expands to even larger radii and the blackbody temperature becomes even cooler . at some point ,",
    "the source may become detectable as an ultraluminous uv source .",
    "such an object may have similarities with the compact , ultraluminous uv source @xcite detected in the core of the ionized nebula mf16 @xcite in the galaxy ngc6946 . in that case",
    ", the emission from the powerful bh may have three components @xcite : an ultraluminous x - ray component , a near - uv component with characteristic blackbody temperature @xmath223,00032,000 k ( consistent with the outer accretion disk and/or a massive donor star ) , and a far - uv source with characteristic temperature @xmath2140,000 k and characteristic radius @xmath2@xmath427 km @xmath2@xmath428 .",
    "the far - uv component is not directly imaged but is inferred from the ionizing flux required to produce the observed he @xmath4164686 line emission from the optical nebula @xcite .",
    "there are not many astrophysical structures with the right size and temperature that can plausibly produce this far - uv component",
    ". it might be the optically thick photosphere of a large - scale outflow , even larger and cooler than what we modelled for the m101 uls ; however , direct two - component x - ray emission is visible in the mf16 ulx @xcite .",
    "the two scenarios are not in contradiction : the ulx may have been engulfed by a thick outflow a few decades ago , when the ionizing far - uv photons were emitted , and may now be in a lower accretion regime in which we see the x - ray emission from the inner accretion flow . scaled to the distance of m101 , a hypothetical outflow photosphere with @xmath429 k and @xmath430 km would have a flux density @xmath431 jy in the f225w filter of _",
    "hst_/wfc3 ( corresponding to @xmath22 electrons s@xmath6 ) ; it would be seen in the optical band at @xmath432 mag , @xmath433 mag .      even at the modest spectral resolution provided by _",
    "chandra_/acis , we have confirmed the presence of absorption edges at @xmath4341.05 kev , at some ( but not all ) epochs . the presence of ( transient ) edges was already noted as a uls feature by @xcite ; see also @xcite for further examples of ulss with edges .",
    "such absorption edges are not seen in two - component ulxs , which may be further evidence that ulss are seen through thicker wind .",
    "the presence of absorption edges at various energies ( in particular from oviii ) was predicted ( but not yet observationally tested ) for ss433 as a key signature of super - critical outflows @xcite .    at some epochs",
    ", we found significant residuals ( particularly around 0.72 kev ) in addition to the dominant , supersoft blackbody component .",
    "such residuals can be described as a hard excess , or a hard emission tail , with a luminosity of a few @xmath435 erg s@xmath6 in the brightest epochs .",
    "we showed that multi - temperature , optically thin thermal plasma ( _ e.g. _ , _ mekal _ in ) provides a good phenomenological fit to this harder emission .",
    "similar spectral features around 1 kev , contributing a luminosity of a few @xmath435 erg s@xmath6 , have been seen in some two - component ulxs ( _ e.g. _ , ngc5408 x-1 and ngc6946 x-1 ) and have also been successfully fitted with thermal plasma emission @xcite .",
    "however , it was also argued @xcite that such features might instead be caused by broadened and blue - shifted absorption lines in a fast , partly ionized , optically - thin outflow .",
    "we do not have enough spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio to test between those two scenarios for the m101 uls . in either case",
    ", there is evidence both of an optically thick thermal emitter ( which we argue is the photosphere of an optically thick outflow rather than the disk surface ) and of a hotter component with absorption and/or emission features .",
    "determining the origin of the hard tail and of the line features imprinted on it is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "if all the excess hard emission comes from thermal - plasma components , we can use the model normalization to estimate the total amount of emitting gas visible to us . for obsid 934-high",
    ", we have @xmath436 @xmath437 . taking the fitted value @xmath438 cm as a characteristic length scale for the emitting gas ,",
    "so that @xmath439 @xmath440 , we obtain @xmath441 @xmath437 , that is @xmath442 g @xmath437 for ionized hydrogen gas .",
    "we obtain a similar back - of - the - envelope estimate for the emission from obsid 4737 . for obsid 934-medium ,",
    "the estimated amount of optically - thin gas is slightly lower , @xmath443 g @xmath437 .",
    "this characteristic density compares well with the density range of the clumpy medium in the mhd simulations of @xcite ( see in particular their fig .  1 ) , at a comparable radial distance from the bh ( @xmath444 km ) .",
    "hard x - ray emission ( modelled with bremsstrahlung or thermal plasma ) from optically thin plasma , in addition to the dominant blackbody - like supersoft component , is often found in classical novae @xcite .",
    "it is generally explained with internal shocks in the expanding envelope , and/or shocks between the fast wind and circumstellar medium .",
    "one possible scenario applicable to the m101 uls , in which the donor star is a wolf - rayet , is that some hard x - ray emission originates from interactions and shocks between the bh outflow and the wolf - rayet wind .",
    "this can perhaps explain the faint ( @xmath445 erg s@xmath6 ) power - law component significantly detected only in the very deep , stacked spectrum of the dim - state observation but consistent with being present at all times .",
    "on the other hand , the much stronger hard x - ray component seen especially in obsid 934 and obsid 4737 varies on the same short timescales as the soft - band emission .",
    "this is difficult to explain if one component comes from stellar wind interactions at @xmath446 cm and the other from much nearer the bh ( @xmath438 cm ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the hard tail is emitted either from the same region as the optically thick blackbody ( perhaps a clumpy outflow , with optically thick clouds in between a hotter , lower - density medium ) , or even from smaller radii .",
    "the supersoft thermal spectrum of the m101 uls ( as well as those of a few other ulss ) has sometimes been interpreted as disk emission . here , we re - examined the x - ray spectral and timing data from a series of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations , and discussed the main problems and internal inconsistencies of that interpretation .",
    "instead , we showed that a model based on the photosphere of an optically thick outflow is consistent with the empirical data .",
    "for example , we showed that for @xmath368700 , our phenomenological model predicts ( for bh masses @xmath447 ) blackbody temperatures @xmath13950130 ev , characteristic radii @xmath13910,000100,000 km , and bolometric luminosities @xmath448 a few times @xmath85 erg s@xmath6 , in agreement with the observations . in this scenario ,",
    "the apparent brightness changes of the m101 uls are mostly due to fast changes in the effective photospheric radius within a clumpy , fast outflow .",
    "when the photosphere expands , its characteristic temperature moves out of the _ chandra _ band and into the far - uv band .",
    "the accretion rate is always highly super - critical , and the apparent faint states would appear just as luminous if observed in the far - uv .    assuming that the massive wind is launched from near the spherization radius , and using a simple spherical and uniform analytic approximation for the outflow , we have argued that there is a critical accretion rate ( @xmath403 a few 100 , corresponding to @xmath449 yr@xmath6 for a stellar - mass bh ) above which the outflow becomes effectively optically thick and completely shrouds the harder emission from the inner part of the accretion flow ( @xmath450 ) . in a more realistic , non - spherically - symmetric model ,",
    "the wind is thicker when seen at higher inclination , and the corresponding threshold in @xmath66 will have an angle dependence .",
    "we suggested that if the accretion rate drops below this limit , and the photosphere shrinks , we may see a harder tail re - emerge in the observed spectrum , with a slope and high - energy break depending on the scattering optical depth in the wind @xcite .",
    "the soft thermal component of standard two - component ulxs is typically @xmath2130300 ev @xcite , and some authors have suggested @xcite that the temperature decreases with increasing accretion rate ( but see @xcite for an opposite interpretation ) . on the other hand , the typical blackbody temperature of ulss is @xmath250150 ev .",
    "we suggest that @xmath451150 ev is the critical threshold at which an outflow photosphere develops and shrouds the ulx : below those temperatures , hard energy tails are rarely seen , while they are usually observed in sources at higher temperatures .",
    "a comparison between the fitted temperature and luminosities of a larger sample of ulss and ulxs is left to a companion paper @xcite . in support of our suggested link between ulss and ulxs",
    ", we noted that in the epochs when the fitted blackbody radius of the m101 uls is larger , the temperature is lower and the spectrum is well modelled with a single blackbody component . in some of the epochs when the radius is smaller and the temperature higher , we found comparatively strong emission above 1.5 kev , which is consistent either with an additional , hotter thermal plasma component or with an inverse - compton tail .",
    "we also argued that the accretion rates required to produce a uls in our scenario ( especially if viewed at high inclination ) are extremely high but not physically impossible : there is at least one source in our galaxy ( ss433 ) with a comparable accretion rate .",
    "recent theoretical models of binary evolution @xcite support the existence of such systems , provided that the donor star is filling its roche lobe . in the specific case of the m101 uls",
    ", this requirement appears to be inconsistent with a claimed orbital period of @xmath28 days @xcite .",
    "we argued that such optical variability measurement may not correspond to the true period , and further investigations on this issue are needed ( but are beyond the scope of this paper ) .",
