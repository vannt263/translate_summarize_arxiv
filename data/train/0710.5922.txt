    "detection of supernova ( sn ) features in the afterglow spectra of several long duration ( typically @xmath15 ) gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) in the past one decade has provided strong support to the hypothesis that a significant fraction , if not all , of the long duration grbs arise from collapse of massive stars ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews .",
    "the observed sn features in the grb afterglow spectra are similar to those usually associated with core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) of type ib / c ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the total energy ( corrected for beaming ) in kev  mev gamma rays emitted by typical long - duration grbs is of order @xmath16 , which is roughly the same as the total explosion energy seen in typical ccsne , although there exists considerable diversity in the energetics of both the sn and the grb components in the sn - grb associations observed so far . in particular , the estimated explosion energies of the sne associated with the grbs observed so far seem to be somewhat larger than those of normal sne , leading to this `` special '' class of sne being sometimes referred to as `` hypernovae '' .",
    "the broad class of observational results on sn - grb associations can be understood within the context of the `` collapsar '' model  @xcite in terms of a simple phenomenological picture ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) in which the core - collapse of a massive wolf - rayet star gives rise to two kinds of outflows emanating from the central regions inside the collapsed star : ( a ) a narrowly collimated and highly relativistic jet that is responsible for the grb activity , the jet being driven , for example , by a rapidly rotating and accreting black hole formed at the center in the core - collapse process , and ( b ) a more wide - angled , quasi - spherical and non - relativistic ( or at best sub - relativistic ) outflow that goes to blow up the star and gives rise to the supernova .",
    "the energies channeled into these two components may in general vary independently , which may explain the diversity of energetics in the observed sn - grb associations . actually , depending on the energy contained in it the `` grb jet '' may or may not be able to penetrate through the stellar material and emerge outside . indeed ,",
    "the fact that the sn - grb associations observed so far involve ccsne of type ib / c , but not of type ii , may be due to the inability of the grb - causing jet to penetrate through the relatively larger amount of outer stellar material in the case of type ii sn as compared to that in sne of type ib / c  @xcite . considering various factors that may govern the energy channeled into the grb - causing jet , such as the mass and rotation rate of the black hole , accretion efficiency , efficiency of conversion of accretion energy into collimated relativistic outflow , and so on , woosley and zhang  @xcite",
    "have obtained a rough lower limit of @xmath17 for the power required for the jet to be able to emerge from the star .",
    "this is consistent with the energetics of the grb components of the sn - grb associations observed so far .",
    "while sn - grb associations strongly support the stellar core - collapse origin of most long - duration grbs , clearly , not all core - collapse events may result in a grb  the latter depends on whether or not the core - collapse event actually results in a `` central engine '' ( a rotating black hole fed by an accretion disk in the above mentioned phenomenological picture , for example ) that is capable of driving the required collimated relativistic outflow . in other words , while every long - duration grb would be expected to be accompanied by a core - collapse supernova  @xcite , the reverse is not true in general .",
    "what fraction of all stellar core - collapse events in the universe produce grbs ?",
    "methods based on astronomical observations generally indicate the ratio between the cosmic grb rate and the cosmic type ib / c sn rate , @xmath18 , to be in the range @xmath19 ",
    "@xmath20 for a wide variety of different assumptions on various relevant parameters such as those that characterize the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) , initial mass function ( imf ) of stars , masses of type ib / c sn progenitors , the luminosity function of grbs , the beaming factor of grbs ( associated with the fact that individual grb emissions are highly non - isotropic and confined to narrowly collimated jets covering only a small fraction of the sky ) , and so on ; see , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath18 comes from the uncertainties in the estimates of the local grb rate and the average grb beaming factor .",
    "however , irrespective of the exact value of the ratio @xmath18 , it is clear that this ratio is significantly less than unity .",
    "this indicates that , apart from just being sufficiently massive stars , the grb progenitors may need to satisfy additional special conditions .",
    "for example , it has been suggested  @xcite that the degree of rotation of the central iron core of the collapsing star and the metalicity of the progenitor star may play crucial roles in producing a grb .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss an alternative probe of the cosmic grb rate that uses the predicted high energy ( tev  pev ) diffuse neutrino background produced by grbs and the experimental upper limit on high energy diffuse neutrino background given by the amanda - ii experiment in the south pole  @xcite .",
    "existence of a high ( tev  pev ) energy diffuse grb neutrino background ( dgrbnub ) due to @xmath5 interactions of ( ultra)high energy protons accelerated within grb sources is a generic prediction  @xcite in most currently popular models of grbs .",
    "this dgrbnub is subject to being probed by the currently operating and up - coming large volume ( kilometer scale ) neutrino detectors such as icecube  @xcite , anita  @xcite , antares  @xcite , for example . since neutrinos ,",
    "unlike electromagnetic radiation , can travel un - hindered from the furthest cosmological distances , the dgrbnub automatically includes the contributions from all grbs in the universe .",
    "thus , an analysis of the dgrbnub is likely to provide a good picture of the true rate of occurrence of these events in the universe . indeed , as we show in this paper , the upper limits on @xmath13 , the ratio of the local ( i.e. , redshift @xmath21 ) grb to ccsn rates , derived here from the consideration of dgrbnub , are , for a wide range of values of the relevant parameters , already more restrictive than the current upper limit on this ratio ( @xmath22 ) inferred from other astronomical considerations  @xcite .",
    "further , non - detection of a diffuse tev ",
    "pev neutrino background by the up - coming icecube detector  @xcite in the south pole after three years of operation , for example , will imply upper limits on @xmath23 at the level of few  @xmath14 , while a detection of the dgrbnub will provide strong support to the hypothesis of proton acceleration to ultrahigh energies within grb jets .",
    "our use of the dgrbnub in constraining the cosmic grb rate is in the same spirit as efforts to constrain the cosmic star formation rate ( and thereby the cosmic ccsn rate ) by using the experimental upper limit ( set by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) detector )  @xcite on the predicted  @xcite low ( few mev ) energy diffuse supernova neutrino background ( dsnub ) ; see , for example , refs .",
    "now that the cosmic sfr including its absolute normalization and thereby the cosmic ccsne rate have got reasonably well determined by the recent high quality data from a variety of astronomical observations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) ( which , by the way , predicts a dsnub flux that is close to the sk upper limit , implying that the dsnub is probably close to being detected in the near future ) , one can begin to think of using this sfr to constrain the ratio of the cosmic grb rate to ccsne rate by using the predicted dgrbnub flux together with the recent upper limits on the diffuse high energy neutrino flux from neutrino telescopes .",
    "we should emphasize here that the upper limits derived in this paper actually refer to the ratio of the rate of grbs to that of _ all _ ccsne including those of type ib / c and type ii , although sn - grb associations observed so far involve sne of type ib / c only .",
    "it is known , however , that type ii sne probably constitute as much as @xmath24 75% of all ccsne ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "thus , one can get the constraint on the grb - to - snib / c ratio from the grb - to - ccsne ratio we obtain here by multiplying the latter by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "conversely , for later comparison , we shall take the `` observed '' value of the ratio @xmath23 to be in the range @xmath26 ",
    "@xmath27  @xcite .",
    "below , we first briefly review the calculation of the dgrbnub spectrum in section [ sec : dgrbnub_calc ] . the resulting upper limits on @xmath28 obtained by comparing the dgrbnub with the current upper limit from amanda - ii experiment",
    "are discussed in section [ sec : fgrbccsn_constraints ] for various values of some of the relevant grb parameters .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summary ] we summarize the main results and conclude .",
    "starting with the original calculations of waxman and bahcall  @xcite , the production of tev  pev neutrinos is widely accepted as a generic prediction of the fireball model of grbs , provided , of course , that protons ( in addition to electrons ) are accelerated to ultrahigh energies within grb jets .",
    "reviews of the basic method of calculation of the expected neutrino flux from grbs can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "recent calculations of the grb neutrino spectra can be found , for example , in  @xcite .    for a given cosmological rate of occurrence of grbs ,",
    "the dgrbnub flux can be calculated by simply convoluting the neutrino production spectrum of individual grbs with the grb rate density as a function of redshift , integrating over redshift up to some maximum redshift , and averaging over the intrinsic grb parameters . in this paper",
    "we closely follow the recent calculation of the dgrbnub spectrum described in ref .",
    "@xcite with appropriate modifications for a possible enhanced evolution of the cosmic grb rate in redshift relative to the cosmic sfr as indicated by a recent analysis of the _ swift _ grb data  @xcite .    in the standard jet fireball model of grbs",
    "( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) , the fundamental source of the observed radiation from grb is the dissipation of kinetic energy of ultra - relativistic ( lorentz factor @xmath29 ) bulk flow of matter ( caused by ejection from a `` central engine '' ) through formation of shocks which accelerate particles ( electrons and protons ) to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "the shocks can form either inside the flow material itself due to collision of different shells of matter moving with different lorentz factors ( `` internal shocks '' ) or due to collision of the flow material with an external medium ( `` external shocks '' ) .",
    "the emission of the observed prompt @xmath30-rays from a grb source is attributed primarily to synchrotron radiation ( with possible additional contribution from inverse compton scattering ) of high energy electrons accelerated in the internal shocks .",
    "it is expected that along with electrons , protons would also be accelerated at the internal shocks .",
    "since synchrotron energy loss of protons is a slow process , protons can be accelerated to much higher energies than electrons .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested  @xcite that protons may be accelerated to ultra - high energies in grb internal shocks and that these uhe protons may explain the observed ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays ( uhecr )  @xcite with energies up to @xmath31 .",
    "these uhe protons interacting with the photons within the grb jet would produce high energy charged pions through the photo - pion production process , @xmath32 , and the subsequent decay of each charged pion would give rise to three high energy neutrinos ( a @xmath33 , a @xmath34 and a @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 .    the dominant contribution to photo - pion production comes from the @xmath37 resonance , @xmath38 , at which the @xmath5 interaction cross section peaks with a value @xmath39 .",
    "this @xmath37 resonance occurs at the proton threshold energy @xmath40 ( as measured in the grb wind rest frame  the `` comoving frame '' hereafter ) , which satisfies @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the comoving frame energy of the colliding photon . in the rest frame of the grb source ( i.e. , the central engine ) ,",
    "the above threshold condition is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the bulk lorentz factor of the grb wind . in each @xmath5 interaction",
    "the pion takes away on average a fraction @xmath24 20% of the energy of the proton , so each neutrino from the decay of the pion carries @xmath24 5% of the energy of the initial proton , assuming that the four final state leptons share the energy of the decaying pion equally .",
    "thus , for a typical photon energy @xmath45 and @xmath46 , say , we have @xmath47 , which will give rise to neutrinos of energy @xmath48 .    the observed prompt @xmath30 ray spectra of most grbs are consistent with photon spectra which are well described by a broken power - law  @xcite : @xmath49 , with @xmath50 for @xmath51 , and @xmath52 for @xmath53 . for typical grbs , the break energy @xmath54 .",

    "we shall assume that at the internal shock protons are accelerated to a differential spectrum , @xmath64 .",
    "the total internal energy in the system , @xmath65 , is assumed to be distributed among electrons , protons and magnetic field as @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , with @xmath69 .",
    "we further assume that electrons are efficient radiators , so that @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the total isotropic - equivalent energy of the emitted gamma ray photons , @xmath72 being the total duration of the burst .",
    "it is worthwhile noting here that in the fireball model the kinetic energy of the initial bulk flow of matter is predominantly carried by protons , they being @xmath24 2000 times more massive than electrons .",
    "this kinetic energy then is converted into internal energy at the shock , whereby the energy is now shared by protons , electrons and magnetic field .",
    "the mechanism by which the energy , which is initially carried mainly in the form of protons , gets transferred to electrons ( and magnetic field ) is not clear , but the phenomenology of the observed radiation from grbs requires a significant fraction of the total internal energy to be eventually carried by electrons ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",

    "efficiency of high energy neutrino production in grbs in the collapsar model with variability on larger timescales has been studied , for example , in refs .",
    "also , neutrino production can be effectively quenched in individual grbs if @xmath44 , the bulk flow lorentz factor , is sufficiently large . clearly , more precise determination of the distribution of the bulk flow lorentz factor and variability timescale of the grbs will be useful in calculating the expected level of the diffuse neutrino flux from grbs more reliably which , together with the results from experiments such as icecube , should be able to place more precise constraints on the fraction of all stellar collapse events that give rise to grbs .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to derive upper limits on the fraction @xmath28 of all stellar core - collapse events that give rise to grbs , by using the current experimental upper limit on the high energy ( tev  pev ) diffuse neutrino background given by the amanda - ii experiment in the south pole , under the assumption that grbs are sources of such high energy neutrinos .",
    "high energy neutrinos are predicted to be produced within grb jets through photopion production by protons and subsequent decay of the charged pions , provided protons are accelerated to ultrahigh energies at the internal shocks within grb jets . in our calculation",
    "we have allowed for a possible evolution of the cosmic grb rate relative to star formation rate . for a wide range of values of various parameters ,",
    "the upper limits on @xmath23 derived here from the amanda - ii results are already more restrictive than the upper limit on this ratio inferred from other astronomical considerations , thus providing a useful independent probe of and constraint on the ccsn - grb connection .",
    "the closeness of the upper limits on @xmath23 derived here ( in particular for the case of enhanced evolution of the grb rate relative to the star formation rate at high redshifts ) to the lower limit on this ratio inferred from various astronomical considerations seems to indicate that the predicted dgrbnub flux should be detectable by the upcoming detectors such as icecube which will have significantly improved sensitivity over that of amanda - ii . on the other hand , non - detection of the dgrbnub by the icecube detector after three years of operation , for example , will give more stringent upper limits on @xmath28 , but at the same time will also imply that either the values of @xmath28 inferred from direct astronomical observations have been significantly overestimated ( which is possible , for example , due to incorrect estimates of the average grb beaming factor ) or that the assumption of proton acceleration to ultrahigh energies within grb jets is invalid , or both of these . however , more precise determination of the distribution of some of the crucial grb parameters such as the bulk flow lorentz factor and variability timescale of the grbs will be needed to reliably calculate the expected contribution of the grbs to the high energy diffuse neutrino background , and thereby to determine the upper limits on @xmath28 more reliably .",
    "to conclude , then , the up - coming large volume neutrino telescopes hold immense promise of yielding significant information both on the nature of the fundamental physical process of particle acceleration in grb sources as well as on the rate of occurrence of these events in the universe .",
    "sne of type ib ( ic ) are thought to arise from progenitors that have lost their hydrogen ( and helium ) envelop before collapse , whereas the progenitor stars giving rise to sne of type ii have their hydrogen envelop still in place at the time of collapse .",
    "actually , there may be cases of `` failed supernovae '' , i.e. , the star may fail to explode even though core - collapse has taken place .",
    "we shall ignore these subtleties here and use the term `` core - collapse supernova '' throughout this paper to denote all core - collapse events .",
    "the normalization of the log - normal distribution used in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite to average over each of the parameters @xmath44 ,  @xmath72   and @xmath115  was incorrect ( n.  gupta , private communication ) .",
    "here we have used the correctly normalized distributions .",
    "we have multiplied the single flavor ( @xmath148 ) amanda - ii upper limit given in ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of 3 to get the all - flavor limit assuming the flavor flux ratio of the neutrinos arriving at earth to be 1:1:1 ."
