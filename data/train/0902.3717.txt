    "two - neutron correlations in neutron - rich nuclei is presently one of the fore - front subjects in the physics of unstable nuclei . in two - neutron halo nuclei @xcite such as @xmath1li , the dineutron correlation",
    "was theoretically predicted in many studies @xcite and is supported by experiments @xcite .",
    "dineutron correlations are discussed also in light neutron - rich nuclei such as in @xmath2he @xcite and also in medium - heavy neutron - rich nuclei @xcite as well as asymmetric nuclear matter ( for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "dineutron correlations are characterized by strong spatial correlations of two neutrons in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "although the neutron - neutron interaction is too weak to form a two - body bound state , the attraction in the @xmath0 channel is rather strong as is known from the large scattering length @xmath3 fm @xcite .",
    "originally the possible existence of a dineutron near the surface of nuclei was predicted by migdal in 1972 @xcite . in his work , it was shown that two interacting particles in a potential well can form a bound state if there is a single - particle level with energy close to zero .",
    "this idea describes the binding mechanism of a borromean system and is extended to the dineutron cluster picture and the dineutron correlation in two - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "recently , dineutron correlations have also been discussed from the point of view of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , which is considered along similar lines as deuteron and @xmath4-particle condensation suggested in dilute nuclear matter @xcite as well as @xmath4 condensate states in excited states of @xmath5 even nuclei @xcite .",
    "this @xmath6-bec feature stems from the surprisingly small size of cooper pairs recently revealed in the surface of nuclei @xcite . in nuclear systems ,",
    "the @xmath7 @xmath8 pair correlation in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) phase has been known to be very important @xcite . from the analysis of the spatial structure of the cooper pair in neutron matter",
    ", a size shrinking is found to occur at finite low density @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the spatially correlated neutron pair may appear in the transition region from weak coupling bcs regime to strong coupling bec regime .",
    "similar bcs - bec crossover features of the spatially correlated neutron pair were predicted also at the surface of medium - heavy nuclei @xcite . since nuclear pairing increases as the size of nuclei shrinks ( @xmath9 mev ) , one may expect that the bec features are enhanced with respect to the infinite matter case .",
    "thus , the spatial structure of neutron pairs at the surface of neutron - rich nuclei attracts presently great interest .",
    "in particular , bcs - bec cross over features are expected to appear in the environment of dilute neutron matter , such as realized in neutron skins @xcite .",
    "this has been put into evidence in recent studies @xcite where it was found that the extension of a @xmath6-cooper pair strongly decreases when going from inside to the surface before expanding again when leaving the nucleus .",
    "the minimum is very pronounced and the cooper pair attains a minimum size of about 2 - 3fm .",
    "this is very small size reaching the dimension of the deuteron , that is of a bound state .",
    "this is also highlighted by the fact that in @xmath1li even the single cooper pair is very small in the surface @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath6-cooper pairs resemble a bound state in the nuclear surface and even become appreciably smaller than in low density neutron matter with maximum gap value , is intriguing . in this work",
    "we want to explore the rather extreme hypothesis that the binding mechanism may be influenced by some quasi two - dimensional features . by quasi two - dimensional ( 2d) , we mean that the bound cooper pairs are confined within a surface layer of about @xmath10 fm and that the degree of freedom in radial direction is approximately frozen .",
    "such a scenario could for example be realized by the fact that the density distribution of valence neutrons in very neutron rich and heavy nuclei are in radial , say @xmath11-direction , concentrated in a surface layer and that the density distribution in @xmath11-direction can be approximated by a frozen gaussian packet , whereas the motion of the neutrons within the layer is free . pursuing the picture to its extreme",
    ", one could imagine a slab of low density neutrons where in the transverse ( @xmath11 ) direction only a single @xmath12 level below the fermi energy is active .",
    "such situation also could eventually be relevant in the lasagne phase in neutron star crusts , where a low - density neutron gas may appear as a layer on the surface of the lasagne structure @xcite . in any case",
    ", one could imagine that in the outer layer of a neutron - rich nucleus , the pairing properties of the valence neutrons are more or less decoupled from the inert core part . for example ,",
    "very neutron - rich sn isotopes with @xmath13 could represent such a scenario . a quasi-2d slab of low density neutron matter with the transverse degrees of freedom approximately frozen",
    "could then , as already mentioned , mimic the situation .",
    "we here insist on the 2d character because it is well known that the dimensionality has great influence on bound state formation and , thus , also on the formation of tight cooper pairs .",
    "such quasi-2d paired systems with low density also have been investigated in cold atom physics e.g. hydrogen atoms on a liquid @xmath14he surface and laser cooled atoms trapped in an planar potential @xcite .    at any rate , and for the different reasons mentioned above , it seemed to us interesting to study an idealized situation of quasi-2d low density neutron matter realized within an infinitely extended slab .",
    "the study may turn out academic in the end but if future more detailed and not completely trivial investigations will exhibit a link to the surprisingly strong bound state features of cooper pairs in the nuclear surface , mentioned above , our effort will have been worth while . in this respect",
    "it is of interest to mention that , indeed , our study will show that in 2d matter a cooper pair attains a minimal size of about 2 fm whereas in 3d this value is over twice as large .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate properties of neutron pairs in quasi-2d neutron systems by using finite - range effective nuclear forces .",
    "concerning the degree of freedom in the transverse @xmath11 direction perpendicular to the 2d plane , we for simplicity assume a gaussian packet as mentioned above .",
    "we study the two - neutron wave function in this model of quasi-2d system and show that two neutrons form a tightly bound state with a small size when the width @xmath15 of the gaussian in @xmath11-direction is small enough .",
    "we also investigate pairing properties of neutron matter based on the bcs theory . pairing gap and size of the cooper pair in quasi-2d neutron systems",
    "are analyzed , and bcs - bec crossover phenomena are discussed .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath8 pairing in infinite three - dimensional ( 3d ) matter has been extensively investigated based on the bcs theory @xcite for symmetric matter and neutron matter ( for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . as for a slab of nuclear matter , properties of @xmath8 pairing in symmetric nuclear matter have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and it was shown that the pairing gap increases at the surface of the slab .",
    "as for @xmath16 pairing , the gradual transition from bcs to bec involving the deuteron formation was predicted in dilute symmetric matter @xcite .",
    "competition of alpha and deuteron condensation was also discussed @xcite .",
    "there are many varieties of bcs calculations of nuclear matter concerning , e.g. , the treatment of single - particle spectra and the pairing interaction . for convenience ,",
    "effective nuclear forces have been used in some calculations on pairing in nuclear matter instead of dealing with realistic bare nuclear forces .",
    "it was shown that the gogny force @xcite , a finite - range effective nuclear force , gives similar behaviour of nuclear matter pairing to that calculated from realistic nuclear forces with the brueckner - hf ( bhf ) approximation , as well as reasonable pairing properties in finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopt the gogny d1s force in the present bcs calculations .",
    "we also use the minnesota force @xcite which reproduces features of @xmath17-wave @xmath18-@xmath18 scattering in @xmath16 and @xmath8 channels , and nucleus - nucleus scattering in the light nuclear region such as the @xmath4-@xmath4 system , as well as properties of light nuclei .",
    "the minnesota force is often used in structure studies of light neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain our simplified model of quasi-2d systems and formulation of the present work .",
    "the effective nuclear forces are described in section [ sec : interaction ] . in section [ sec : results ] , the results obtained for a two - neutron system and neutron matter are shown , and in section [ sec : discussion ] discussions are outlined .",
    "finally , we give a summary and outlook in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "here we explain our framework of the simplified model of quasi-2d neutron system confined in a slab with a certain thickness .",
    "we first describe the wave function and the hamiltonian for a quasi-2d neutron matter system .",
    "we then explain the isolated two - neutron system and give the formalism for the quasi-2d system within the bcs theory .      according to the outline of the introduction",
    ", we propose a model for a system of neutrons confined in a slab with a certain thickness .",
    "we assume that the neutrons in transverse ( @xmath11 ) direction are represented by a simple gaussian packet of size @xmath15 .",
    "as already mentioned , this size may mimic the concentration of the amplitudes of single particle wave functions in a surface layer , where @xmath11 corresponds to the radial direction in finite neutron - rich nuclei .",

    "the factor decreases with the increase of the width parameter @xmath15 . the thickness of the slab is only reflected in a weakening of the interaction for bigger slab sizes in our genuinely two - dimensional model .",
    "these are , of course , strongly simplified , may be oversimplified , assumptions to describe the detailed behaviour of the valence neutrons because the pauli effect from the core should be more complicated and a long tail of weakly bound neutrons may be not so simple . however , it is expected that such effects may effectively be taken into account by a modification of the width parameter @xmath15 . in the present work ,",
    "we analyze properties of neutron pairs in quasi-2d neutron systems for various values of the slab size @xmath15 .      for later comparison",

    "[ fig : wf - phi ] .",
    "we also show the two - neutron wave function @xmath41 for the dineutron bound state in the quasi-2d system and @xmath139 in 3d neutron matter . in the @xmath123 limit ,",
    "the pair wave function @xmath134 becomes equal to the isolated two - neutron wave function @xmath41 of the dineutron state in case of quasi-2d neutron matter , while @xmath139 in 3d neutron matter becomes infinitely broad because there is no two - neutron bound state in a 3d system .",
    "= 16 cm    = 12 cm",
    "in this section we tentatively associate the strong pairing correlations of valence neutrons in neutron - rich nuclei with the ones in a 2d system . it has recently become evident that in neutron - rich or neutron halo nuclei pairing correlations may show a strong maximum in the surface .",
    "this is for instance evidenced by the fact that the size of the cooper pairs has a sharp minimum in the surface .",
    "this feature has been shown to hold true in the case of a single cooper pair @xcite as well as in cases of many cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "though for the moment , it can not be excluded that the pronounced small cooper pair sizes in the nuclear surface is due to a somewhat trivial , i.e. geometrical effect@xcite , we here make the hypothesis that this is due to a real strong correlation effect , due to the presence of a surface and hence of a 2d influence .    the valence nucleons may be confined in a surface shell for different reasons .",
    "for example , if valence neutrons are , in a heavy nucleus , distributed around a high lying principal shell , the corresponding density distribution , for instance if the shell does not contain an @xmath17 wave , may be concentrated in the surface region .",
    "even though low angular momentum orbits with radial nodes have some strength distribution in the inner region , their probability amplitudes may show peak structure in the surface , and therefore , the pairing is expected to be induced by the surface neutrons due to the possible mixing of many states having significant overlap of their radial part in the surface region . on the other hand",
    "it is also well known that finite size _ enhances _ pairing .",
    "this is already documented by the fact that the nuclear gap varies on average like @xmath140 mev , that is the presence of a surface certainly plays a role .",
    "this finite size enhancement is a quite subtle effect as theoretical investigations show @xcite and implies several competing effects .",
    "how much the scenario is influenced by quasi 2d features is still an open question but an interesting and suggestive hypothesis which we wanted to explore in this work .",
    "so one may consider that the strongly correlated cooper pairs with about a rms radius of 2 fm live in a surface sheet about @xmath10 fm across . in section [ sec : formulation ] we mimicked the transverse motion of the neutrons by a simple frozen gaussian @xmath141 .",
    "the motion perpendicular to @xmath11 is considered as planar .",
    "this is , of course , a highly idealized representation of the situation as mentioned several times .",
    "it may nevertheless capture some 2d features which possibly underly the strong pairing correlations in the neutron skin of neutron - rich nuclei .    in the previous analysis of pair size in quasi 2d neutron matter in section [ sec :",
    "results ] , the bcs - bec crossover may occur only in dilute 2d matter for densities @xmath142 @xmath143 .",
    "let us estimate how many small sized cooper pairs can condensate in an area @xmath144 of the nuclear surface .",
    "for the dineutron condensation , more than one pair should exist at least . from the condition @xmath142 @xmath143",
    ", two dineutrons can condensate in the surface area for @xmath145 fm , and four dineutrons for @xmath146 fm .",
    "recently , two - neutron correlations in neutron - skin nuclei have been investigated in light nuclei such as @xmath2he and @xmath147c @xcite as well as medium - heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "@xmath2he is considered to be a neutron - skin nucleus having four valence neutrons surrounding an @xmath4 core , and therefore this nucleus is one of the simple examples to discuss neutron pair correlations in neutron skins . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the @xmath2he ground state has spin - zero two - neutron correlations . from the above - mentioned discussion of quasi-2d neutron matter",
    ", the correlation in the ground state is expected to be of bcs - type rather than in the bcs - bec crossover region , because the valence neutron distribution concentrates in the surface with a distance @xmath148 fm , which is smaller than the bcs - bec crossover condition @xmath145 fm for the condensation of two dineutrons . instead of the ground state , the possible existence of an excited state @xmath2he(@xmath149 ) with a dilute gas - like state of dineutrons was suggested by one of the authors @xcite . according to the theoretical results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the dineutrons exist around the region with @xmath150 fm which satisfies the above - mentioned condition for the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "therefore , this state could have bec - like dineutrons at the surface .    in medium - heavy nuclei ,",
    "the spatial structure of spin - zero neutron pairing at the surface was investigated based on hfb calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite . to discuss two - neutron correlations in the neutron skin in connection with quasi-2d neutron matter",
    ", one should analyze the radial and angular behaviour separately and focus on the angular correlations ( opening angle ) of neutron pairing , as well as on the size of the cooper pairs .",
    "the transition from bcs phase to bcs - bec crossover is characterized by the change of the pair wave function from a weak - coupling nodal structure to an enhanced single bound state like peak .",
    "if such a structure change is found in the angular behaviour it may be an indication of the bcs - bec crossover , while a clear evidence may not be seen in the radial structure because it might be affected by pauli effect from constituent neutrons of the core .",
    "the spatial structure of spin - zero neutron pairing is displayed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that the nodal structure along the angular direction is seen inside from the surface and it disappears on the outer side of the surface . more detailed analysis of the angular behaviour is requested . on the other hand , a good measure of the correlations",
    "also is the size of the cooper pairs .",
    "their rms radius seems systematically very small in the outer part of the nuclear surface @xcite , that is much smaller than the smallest value in homogeneous 3d matter .",
    "whether this also always goes along with a maximum in the pair correlations at the same place in a finite nucleus , remains to be seen .",
    "let us also comment on other effects omitted in the present model of infinite quasi-2d neutron matter . at the surface of a realistic finite nuclear system ,",
    "valence neutrons feel the centrifugal force and the spin - orbit force which may work so as to break @xmath6-cooper pairs .",
    "periodicity condition on the spherical surface is another effect to be considered .",
    "two - neutron correlations have extensively been investigated in two - neutron halo nuclei by means of three - body models of two neutrons and a core @xcite .",
    "recently , it was suggested that the internal two - neutron wave function analyzed as a function of the distance @xmath151 from the nuclear center shows behaviour similar to the pair wave function of 3d neutron matter in the bcs - bec crossover region @xcite . in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , the inter - neutron wave function has a nodal structure at small @xmath151 , and it shows enhancement of the spatial correlations with increasing @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , in a further analysis of the neutron pair in @xmath1li , size shrinking was found at the surface @xcite .",
    "it was found that there the pair is as small as 3 fm at @xmath152 fm @xcite .",
    "the formation of the small sized dineutron at the surface of @xmath1li may be understood with the picture of a quasi-2d neutron system . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite with a three - body model , the spin - zero component of two neutrons shows a strong angular correlation and its distribution concentrates at the surface with @xmath153 fm .",
    "the situation corresponds to the quasi-2d neutron where the valence neutrons are confined at the surface region and the neutron pair is formed due to the angular correlation .",
    "it may be interpreted as the reduction of the dimension from three to two , being crucial for the small - sized neutron pair in two - neutron halo nuclei . at the small @xmath151 region ,",
    "i.e. near the core , the size of the neutron pair increases and nodal structure appears in the relative wave function in the three - body model .",
    "this is because the pauli effect from the constituent neutrons of @xmath154li core raises the fermi momentum of the valence neutrons .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the weakening of the pair correlation in the bcs region at @xmath155 in the quasi-2d neutron matter .    in spite of the analogous behaviour of the neutron pair in @xmath1li to that of the cooper pair in the quasi-2d neutron matter",
    ", one should keep in mind that two - neutron halo nuclei has only one pair of neutrons and the phenomena there is not regarded as the cooper pair condensation in the bcs picture .",
    "several investigations have , however , revealed that the features of a single cooper pair and the ones of a cooper pair embedded in several others are not drastically different .",
    "it is also interesting to consider two - proton correlation in proton - rich nuclei in analogy to the two - neutron correlation in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "while the energy of infinite proton matter diverges without charge neutrality , proton - rich matter such as proton halo or proton skin structure can exist in finite nuclei .",
    "moreover , since two - proton decays are allowed from some proton - rich nuclei such as @xmath156be,@xmath2c,@xmath157o and @xmath158ne @xcite , more direct information of @xmath8 pair correlation could be experimentally obtained than for the case of neutron - rich nuclei .    in the same way as neutron systems",
    ", we calculate a wave function @xmath159 for the two - proton bound state in quasi-2d systems .",
    "coulomb force ( @xmath160 ) is added to the two - body effective nuclear forces . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf-2p ] , the obtained two - proton wave functions in the @xmath0-wave channel are shown in comparison with those of the dineutron state .",
    "because of the coulomb force , the spatial correlation of the @xmath8 pair is slightly more suppressed in the two - proton system than in the two - neutron system .",
    "however , the wave functions for @xmath105 fm and @xmath106 fm still have a pronounced peak .",
    "it suggests that the spatial correlation of the @xmath8 pair also is present in proton systems .",
    "singlet @xmath17 ( @xmath0 ) @xmath6 correlations in quasi-2d neutron systems were studied in a simplified model of neutrons confined in a slab with a certain thickness . the finite - range effective nuclear forces , the gogny d1s and minnesota forces , were adopted for the study .",
    "the strength of the two - body interaction in the quasi-2d systems depends on the width @xmath15 of the slab .",
    "namely , the interaction is stronger for thinner slabs than for wider ones . when the width of a slab is small enough , e.g. around @xmath105 fm , two neutrons form a tightly bound dineutron with a size as small as the deuteron size .",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath6-cooper pair in the quasi-2d neutron matter was investigated by means of the bcs theory . in quasi-2d neutron matter",
    ", the transition region of the bcs - bec crossover appears at @xmath130 and for @xmath161 fm .",
    "the size shrinking of the cooper pair occurs at finite low @xmath61 because of the pauli effect .",
    "it is also important to note that , as the width @xmath15 of the slab decreases , the pair correlation in 2d is enhanced and the cooper pair size becomes small because of the stronger attraction in the thinner slab .",
    "this is one of the characteristics different from 3d . in particular",
    ", the reduction of the dimension from 3d to 2d is crucial to form the strongly correlated neutron pair .",
    "the chemical potential becomes negative for @xmath162 and , therefore , there is true two - neutron binding in quasi-2d neutron matter and a genuine bec regime is born out .",
    "the relation of the quasi-2d neutron matter to finite neutron - rich nuclei was also discussed .",
    "several studies of the past have revealed that the size of cooper pairs changes very substantially from inside to outside of a nucleus @xcite .",
    "the subject has been taken up again more recently and the radius dependence of a neutron - neutron ( @xmath6 ) cooper pair has been investigated more systematically @xcite .",
    "it thereby turned out that the old believe that the size of a cooper pair is of the order of the diameter of a large nucleus must be revisited when considered locally , i.e. , as a function of the nuclear radius .",
    "namely , detailed bcs calculations with the d1s gogny force have shown that the rms radius of an @xmath6-cooper pair , though indeed large in the interior , becomes very small in the outer surface of a nucleus , where the density is low , before expanding again when leaving the nucleus .",
    "the minimum extension of a cooper pair attains a size as small as 2 fm , that is the same as the size of a deuteron , a bound state .",
    "although the variation of the pair radius as a function of the density qualitatively follows the one of infinite matter , a factor of two reduction of the pair diameter with respect to the homogeneous case is a quite surprisingly strong effect which calls for an explanation .",
    "we considered this pair size shrinking in the surface of neutron - rich nuclei with the present calculations of quasi-2d neutron systems , based on the hypothesis that the valence neutrons in a neutron - rich nucleus live in radial direction in a surface sheet about @xmath10 fm across because the wave functions of the active shell are essentially concentrated in the surface while the nucleons are free to move within the sheet .",
    "the idea behind this scenario is that the neutrons in the surface sheet are essentially constrained to a two - dimensional world which could give a certain clue to the smallness of the cooper pairs , since in two dimensions even an isolated @xmath6 pair forms a bound state .",
    "pursuing this idea , we further idealized the situation assuming a planar slab of neutrons where for simplicity the motion perpendicular to the slab is frozen into a gaussian wave packet in order to simulate the surface concentration of the valence neutrons in radial direction .",
    "freezing the perpendicular motion means that the neutrons are two - dimensional in the direction of the slab .",
    "the thickness of the slab only influences the strength of the pairing force , as already mentioned above .",
    "we , indeed , find that for reasonable slab thicknesses of @xmath163 fm , the pair radius is of the order of 2@xmath1643 fm in agreement with realistic 3d hfb calculations @xcite .",
    "we are , of course , aware of the fact that our model may be strongly oversimplified and further studies are required in order to ascertain whether a 2d aspect indeed helps to interpret the occurrence of astoundingly small cooper pairs in the nuclear surface .",
    "one also should keep in mind that a local picture may be a little too simple in the sense that the pair size certainly fluctuates a lot .",
    "nevertheless , a classical picture often grasps a good deal of reality , even in so tiny quantum object as nuclei .",
    "neutron pairs much smaller than the dimension of a nucleus may approximately be considered as bosons and a strong coupling bose - einstein condensation scenario of @xmath6 pairs may be realized in the surface of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "bound state like cooper pairs in the nuclear surface may also allow to reinterpret neutron transfer reactions into superfluid nuclei which are known to have a strongly enhanced cross section @xcite .",
    "2d aspects may also be relevant in the lasagne phase in neutron star crust . in practical application to such systems",
    ", one should extend the model by taking into account finite temperature and also excitation in the @xmath11-direction for higher neutron density .",
    "bcs and bec problems of two - dimensional fermion systems have been discussed also in the field of condensed matter physics in relation to electron systems and atomic systems @xcite .",
    "phenomena of bec and bcs - bec crossover in quasi-2d systems of trapped gases have been discussed in recent works @xcite , and it has been suggested that the condensation in a quasi-2d gas is sensitive to the frequency @xmath165 of the confinement in the `` frozen '' direction .",

    "<S> two - neutron correlation in the @xmath0 channel in quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) neutron systems at zero temperature is studied by means of the bcs theory with finite - range effective nuclear forces . </S>",
    "<S> the dineutron correlation in low density neutron systems confined in an infinite slab is investigated in a simplified model that neutron motion of one direction is frozen . when the slab is thin enough , two neutrons form a tightly bound dineutron with a small size in the quasi-2d system , and a bose dineutron gas is found in low density limit . </S>",
    "<S> with increase of fermi momentum , the neutron system changes from the bose - gas phase to the superfluid cooper pair phase . </S>",
    "<S> the density dependence of the neutron pairing shows the bcs - bec crossover phenomena at finite low - density region . in the transition region , the size shrinking of neutron pair and enhancement of pairing gap are found . </S>",
    "<S> the relation to dineutron correlation at surface of neutron - rich nuclei is also discussed . </S>"
