    "nuclear reactions are the ubiquitous experimental tool to study atomic nuclei .",
    "while many astrophysically relevant reactions proceed at relatively low energies @xmath2  mev  @xcite , in the laboratory , these reactions are often studied indirectly with beams at higher energy ( @xmath35 mev / u ) .",
    "one of the most important open questions currently being explored today in our field concerns the astrophysical site for the r - process , the process that gave rise to about half of the heavy elements in our planet . in order to perform simulations of neutron star mergers or supernovae explosions ( the two possible sites under consideration ) , neutron capture rates",
    "are needed on rare isotopes of nuclei as heavy as uranium @xcite .",
    "despite all the effort with _ ab initio _ approaches to nuclear reactions , which include the study of elastic scattering  @xcite , transfer  @xcite , photo reactions  @xcite , and capture reactions  @xcite , only selected nuclei and specific reaction channels can be addresssed with the various ab - initio methods in the market ( refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews )",
    ".    a more general approach to reactions involving heavier nuclei is based on a reduction of the many - body picture to a few - body one , where only the most relevant degrees of freedom are retained @xcite . in such approaches",
    "one introduces effective interactions ( the so - called optical potentials ) between the clusters considered .",
    "traditionally these interactions have been constrained by data , particularly using data on @xmath4-stable isotopes  @xcite . clearly , the application of these global parameterizations to exotic regions of the nuclear chart is unreliable and has uncontrolled uncertainties .",
    "it is critical for progress in the field of reactions that these effective interactions be connected to the underlying microscopic theory so that extrapolations to exotic regions can be better understood .    in most cases ,",
    "phenomenological optical potentials are made local for simplicity .",
    "we know based on the feshbach projection formalism that , in its most general form , the microscopic optical potential should be complex , non - local and energy dependent  @xcite .",
    "recently , a series of studies has shown that nonlocality can affect transfer reaction observables ( e.g. @xcite ) and it is expected that it can equally affect other reaction channels .",
    "so far we have not been able to identify an experimental method to constrain nonlocality .",
    "it is essential that microscopic theories provide guidance on this aspect of the optical potential .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide a proof - of - principle for a new method to compute nuclear optical potentials from ab - initio many - body coupled cluster calculations .",
    "it is the first of a series of studies that aims at constructing an optical potential rooted in the underlying microscopic formulation of the problem , potentials which can then be incorporated , consistently with other ingredients , into the general few - body formalism . in an approach based on feshbach projection operators ,",
    "the optical potential is the self - energy term in the dyson equation  @xcite .",
    "thus , the solution of the dyson equation by self - consistent green s function methods can be used to compute optical potentials  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we compute the green s function directly from the coupled cluster method  @xcite , thus circumventing the usual self - consistency approach .",
    "the self - energy can then be determined by inverting the dyson equation .",
    "the key elements in our approach to compute the green s function are : i ) an analytical continuation in the complex energy plane based on a berggren basis consisting of bound , resonant , and non - resonant scattering states  @xcite , and ii ) a generalized non - symmetric lanczos method @xcite that allows us to write the green s function as a continued fraction @xcite .",
    "the first of these two elements is essential because it allow us to properly deal with the poles of the green s function along the real energy axis , and obtain numerically stable green s functions and optical potentials for arbitrary energies .",
    "the second element is essential to make the problem computationally feasible . in this work",
    "we demonstrate that optical potentials , converged with respect to the models space , can indeed be determined from the green s functions generated from coupled cluster many - body calculations .",
    "we note that the computation of green s functions with the coupled - cluster method is well established in quantum chemistry  @xcite , and that very recently this approach has also been used to extract the optical potential  @xcite .",
    "our approach is similar to that effort , but applied to nuclear many - body problem .",

    "the advantage of working in the lanczos basis is twofold .",
    "first , the actual dimensions of the linear systems ( defined by the number of lanczos vectors @xmath114 ) needed to reach convergence , are much smaller than the dimension of the full space @xmath102 and @xmath106 .",
    "second , the resolution has to be done only once for all energies @xmath115 .",
    "let us now focus on the first term on the right hand side of ( [ gfcc4 ] ) , i.e. the term associated with the particle part of the green s function .",
    "starting with the normalized states @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( where the norm is @xmath118 ) as right and left lanczos pivots , we construct iteratively a set of @xmath114 pairs of lanczos vectors . by construction",
    ", @xmath75 is conveniently represented in the lanczos basis as a tridiagonal matrix : @xmath119 using the cramer s rule for the resolution of linear systems , one can then show that @xmath120 is given by the continued fraction @xmath121 as it is clear from the expression above , one just needs to solve the linear system  ( [ eqx ] ) only once in order to calculate @xmath122 for any value of the energy @xmath115 .",
    "the convergence as a function of @xmath114 is quickly reached as we will show in sec .",
    "( [ secres ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the second term in ( [ gfcc4 ] ) , i.e. the hole part of the green s function , proceeds in a similar manner .",

    "( [ gfcc2 ] ) has poles at energies @xmath123 which make the numerical calculation unstable .",
    "there have been various proposed solutions to this problem , such as using a complex scaling technique @xcite , or carrying calculations at finite values of @xmath124 and extrapolate to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "another ( phenomenological ) approach to this problem is to employ a finite energy dependent width which account for damping and decay processes that are not included in the employed theoretical approach  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we suggest a different approach based on an analytic continuation of the green s function in the complex energy plane using a berggren basis @xcite , that includes bound- , resonant , and discretized non - resonant continuum states . as we will demonstrate below , by employing the berggren basis it is possible to obtain stable numerical results as @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the set of hf states includes bound , resonant ( when they exist ) and complex - continuum states single - particle states .",
    "accordingly , the many - body spectrum for the @xmath55 ( @xmath92 ) systems obtained with the pa - eom ccsd ( pr - eom ccsd ) is composed of bound , resonant and complex - continuum states .",
    "in other words , the poles of the green s function [ cf eq .",
    "( [ gfcc2 ] ) ] have either a negative real or complex energy . as a consequence , as @xmath12 ,",
    "the values of the green s function matrix elements for @xmath125 smoothly converge to a finite value . in the case of a real hf basis consisting of bound , and discretized real energy continuum states ,",
    "the calculation would become unstable for small @xmath124 since the green s function poles would then be located at real values of @xmath115 . in order to fulfill the berggren completeness @xcite , the complex - continuum single - particle states must be located along a contour @xmath126 in the fourth quadrant of the complex momentum plane below the resonant single - particle states . according to the cauchy theorem , the precise form of the contour @xmath126 is not important , provided all resonant states lie between the contour and the real momentum axis .",
    "the berggren completeness then reads @xmath127 where the discrete states @xmath128 correspond to bound and resonant solutions of the single - particle potential , and @xmath129 are complex - energy scattering states along the complex - contour @xmath126 . in practise ,",
    "the integral along the complex continuum is discretized yielding a finite discrete basis set .",
    "we now present results for the elastic scattering of a neutron on @xmath0 .",
    "the choice of this problem is motivated by the fact that @xmath130 is a doubly magic nucleus and as such can be computed relatively precisely using the coupled - cluster method .",
    "we will work at in the ccsd approximation and use the @xmath131 @xcite nucleon - nucleon interaction .",

    "we include all harmonic oscillator shells such that @xmath137 and for a given @xmath138 state in @xmath134 , we only use berggren states for the partial wave @xmath139 that couples with the @xmath140 gs state in @xmath5 to the total angular momentum @xmath138 . for instance , for the @xmath141 ground state in @xmath142o",

    ", we computed this state using eom - ccsd and found it at about 10  mev of excitation .",

    "one path forward is to introduce a phenomenological and energy dependent width in the green s function , to account for higher - order correlations such as @xmath159-@xmath64 and @xmath63-@xmath237 not included in pa / pr - eom ccsd @xcite . as shown in fig.[fig : pot_imag ] , this will increase the absorption at lower energies .",

    ", we wrote the green s function as a continued fraction , and reached convergence as the number of lanczos iterations increases .    in the coupled - cluster singles and doubles approximation ,",
    "the optical potential and the neutron elastic scattering phase shifts on @xmath0 converge well with respect to the size of the single - particle basis , for the low partial waves .",
    "the predicted optical potential has a strong nonlocality , that is not gaussian .",
    "in addition , we found an almost vanishing imaginary part of the potential for scattering energies below 10  mev .",
    "this lack of an absorptive component was attributed to neglected higher - order correlations in the employed coupled - cluster methods .    in the future , we plan to update the nn force currently used , to one that is able to reproduce charge radii of heavier systems .",
    "we also plan to include three - nucleon forces in the coupled - cluster calculations of the green s functions , as well as higher - order correlations in the employed coupled - cluster methods .",
    "we expect this will produce an increase in the imaginary part of the derived optical potential .",
    "once these improvements are in place , this work can be extended to other systems , and to other reaction channel such as transfer , capture , breakup and charge - exchange .",
