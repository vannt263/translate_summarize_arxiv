    "in recent years , ads / cft correspondence has been widely used to investigate strongly correlated condensed - matter physics .",
    "one of remarkable achievements is holographic model of superconductors@xcite .",
    "the superconductors described in the weakly coupled gravitational background are dual to those strongly coupled superconductors in the boundary theory .",
    "it is an excellent example to show the power of gauge / gravity duality since the strongly coupled superconductors still lacks an effective description in condensed - matter physics .",
    "in contrast , the ads / cft correspondence provides an elegant and systematic procedure to study the peculiar properties of superconductors .",
    "it is also possible to develop a deep understanding on various mysteries such as the paring mechanism and enhanced critical temperature of superconductors .",
    "since the boundary theory is in general not scale invariant below some dynamical scale , it is more important to study non - relativistic holography with scale invariance broken in the bulk . in this paper , we introduce a dilaton field to effectively break the scale invariance of the bulk geometry@xcite .",
    "we then move on to discuss p - wave superconductors using su(2 ) non - abelian gauge field@xcite . by rescaling the gauge coupling constant as @xmath2",
    ", we couple the dilaton to the gauge field .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is chosen to be positive .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , we find that the real part of the conductivity monotonically decreases .",
    "the dc conductivity defined at the zero frequency approaches zero and vanishes when @xmath1 exceeds some critical value .",
    "this indicates the characteristics of insulators . with",
    "the increasing of @xmath1 , the system behaves more and more like an insulator in the normal phase .",
    "when the chemical potential crosses a critical point , the system begins to superconduct .",
    "the order parameter defined by @xmath3 condenses , leading to a hairy near the horizon of the black hole and a gap is opened in the real part of the conductivity .",
    "moreover , there exists a drude - like structure at some frequency close to the zero frequency point in the conductivities along the x - direction .",
    "this is similar to the result published in ref.@xcite .",
    "when @xmath1 increases , we find that the critical chemical potential in general decreases and the maximum height of the dissipative conductivity is suppressed , consistent with our intuition for insulators .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly introduce the gravity solution in einstein - dilaton model . in section 3",
    ", we present the holographic model of p - wave superconductors coupled to the dilaton and derive the equations of motion ( eoms ) .",
    "we numerically find that the order parameter condenses when the chemical potential crosses a critical value . in section 4",
    ", we investigate the fluctuation modes of yang - mills theory . in the end",
    ", we present a short conclusion in section 5 .",
    "let s consider the standard einstein - dilaton action : @xmath4 ,    \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the newton constant , @xmath6 is the ricci scalar , @xmath7 is a real scalar field ( the dilaton ) and the ads radius has been set to 1 . in order to obtain the dilaton black hole solutions , the potential @xmath8 has to be chosen appropriately . it reads@xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constants .",

    "the constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath21 . since the potential of the dilaton is symmetric under @xmath22@xcite . from now on , we focus on @xmath23 .",
    "the black hole horizon is defined by @xmath24 and @xmath25 is determined by @xmath21 and @xmath19 .",
    "a special case is @xmath26 .",
    "the dilaton vanishes and the dilaton black hole with scale invariance broken is reduced to the standard scale invariant schwarschilld black hole with @xmath27 , @xmath28 . in this case @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the scale invariance broken of the bulk geometry can be measured by the difference @xmath30 is proportional to the hyperscaling violation @xmath31 in the zero temperature limit , which directly measures how strongly the scale invariance is broken . ] . in the next sections , we will set @xmath32 for convenience .",
    "in order to investigate p - wave superconductors in holography , we start from su(2 ) action @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the gauge potential , @xmath36 is the structure constant of the lie group .",
    "the dilaton has been coupled to the gauge field and rescale the effective gauge coupling constant . in the following , we will not consider the backreaction effect of the gauge field on the einstein - dilaton sector by taking the probe limit @xmath37 .",
    "the equation of motion is obtained by variation of the action with respect to the gauge potential @xmath38 to discuss the p - wave superconductors , we consider the following ansatz @xmath39 it is straightforward to derive equation of motions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 where prime denotes @xmath44 . recall that the u(1 ) subgroup of su(2 ) generated by @xmath45 is specified to be electromagnetic .",
    "the function @xmath40 is interpreted as the time component of the u(1 ) field while @xmath41 plays the role of order parameters .",
    "it is more convenient to work by rescaling the radial coordinate as @xmath46 .",
    "the above equations of motion remain unchanged with the fields rescaled as @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "notice that the location of the horizon has been scaled to unity .",
