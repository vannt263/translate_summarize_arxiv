    "the spheres are connected by @xmath7 arms / rods , such that the distances between the centres of neighbouring spheres are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , see fig.[n - robot ] ( in this paper latin subscripts change from @xmath10 to @xmath0 , while greek subscripts change from @xmath10 to @xmath7 ) .",

    "the @xmath4-component @xmath18 of this velocity at distance @xmath19 along @xmath4-axis is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the radius and velocity of a sphere , see @xcite",
    ". equality ( [ exact-1b ] ) follows from the fact that the external forces exerted on each arm are negligible .",
    "the geometrical configuration of a micro - robot is determined by _ given _",

    "( or mean - functions ) @xmath61 do not depend on @xmath49 .",
    "a unique decomposition @xmath62 is valid .",
    "the @xmath63-dependence of @xmath64 ( [ exact-1-dless ] ) leads to the presentation of matrix @xmath65 ( [ matrixa ] ) as a series in @xmath63 @xmath66 r_{ik}\\widetilde{l}_{ik}/l_{ik}^2 & \\text{for}\\ i\\neq k \\end{cases}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we do not present the expression for @xmath67 since it does not affect the final answer . in double series ( with small parameters",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath68 ) matrices @xmath69 , @xmath67 and @xmath70 appear in the terms of orders @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .    the introduction of fast time variable @xmath49 and slow time variable @xmath48 represents the crucial step of our asymptotic procedure .",
    "we choose : @xmath74 this choice can be justified by the same distinguished limit arguments as in @xcite . here",
    "we present this choice without proof , however the most important part of this proof ( that this choice leads to a valid asymptotic procedure ) is exposed and exploited below .",
    "after the use of the chain rule @xmath75 we accept ( temporarily ) that @xmath49 and @xmath48 represent two independent variables .",
    "the substitution of ( [ chain]),([matrix - dec ] ) into ( [ exact-1-dless - matrix ] ) gives its two - timing form : @xmath76 unknown functions are taken as regular series @xmath77 where @xmath78 , which means that long distances of self - swimming are caused by small oscillations : @xmath79 .",
    "the successive approximations of ( [ exact-1-dless - matrix - ser]),([x - f - ser ] ) yield :    _ terms of order _ @xmath80 :   @xmath81 ;    _ terms of order _ @xmath82 :  @xmath83 ; its average gives @xmath84 and the oscillating part is @xmath85    _ terms of order _ @xmath86 :  @xmath87 ; its averaged part is @xmath88 force @xmath89 can be excluded from ( [ two - aver]),([exact-1aa ] ) as : @xmath90 the averaged self - propulsion motion means that the rate of changing is @xmath91 with the same function @xmath92 for all spheres ; therefore we write @xmath93 .",
    "hence ( [ two - aver - a ] ) gives @xmath94 where in the denominator matrix @xmath95 is replaced with @xmath69 , since we consider only the main ( linear in @xmath68 ) term in ( [ vel - self - prop ] ) .",
    "expression ( [ vel - self - prop ] ) still contains unknown functions @xmath96 which can be determined from ( [ one - tilde ] ) with the use of constraints ( [ exact-1aaa]),([exact-1aa ] ) .",
    "indeed , equation ( [ one - tilde ] ) ( with the terms required for linear in @xmath68 precision in ( [ vel - self - prop ] ) ) gives : @xmath97 one can see that ( [ tilde - x]),([exact-1aaa ] ) yield @xmath98 , while ( [ exact-1aa ] ) leads to @xmath99 .",
    "both restrictions can be written with the use of @xmath100 constraint matrix @xmath101 : @xmath102 the substitution of its inverse form @xmath103 into ( [ vel - self - prop ] ) yields @xmath104 where @xmath105 the expression for inverse matrix ( [ m-1 ] ) can be checked by direct calculations of product @xmath106 ; these calculations become particularly simple if the matrix in the right hand side of ( [ m-1 ] ) is decomposed into two matrices : one containing all @xmath107 s , and another with identical rows @xmath108 .",
    "it is worth to emphasise that the presented analytic procedure is especially simple , since in order to calculate the self - propulsion velocity ( [ vel - self - prop ] ) one needs only to know the main approximation @xmath109 for mutual oscillations of spheres , while this approximation is completely described by simple equations ( [ tilde - x]),([tilde - xc ] ) .",
    "one can see from ( [ her ] ) that @xmath110 .",
    "hence the order of magnitude of dimensionless physical velocity is : @xmath111 the substitution of @xmath70 ( [ matrix - dec ] ) and @xmath112 ( [ m-1 ] ) into ( [ her ] ) and subsequent algebraic transformations lead to @xmath113 where the sum ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) is taken over all possible triplets @xmath114 . in ( [ g ] )",
    "one can also take @xmath115 , which can be proved by integration by parts .",
    "the formulae ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) , ( [ g ] ) have been obtained for @xmath116 by explicit analytical calculations and for any @xmath0 by the method of mathematical induction .",
    "these calculations are straightforward but rather cumbersome to be presented here . however ,",
    "as soon as ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) and ( [ g ] ) are known , they can be verified by separate calculations of all terms proportional to @xmath117 for each particular pair @xmath118 .",
    "for example , for @xmath119 the relevant part of matrix @xmath120 ( [ matrix - dec ] ) contains only @xmath121 , while all other components are zero .",
    "the related part of ( [ her ] ) can be easily calculated ; it leads to the same expression as the corresponding extraction from ( [ vel - self - prop - final+]),([g ] ) , which in this case contains only @xmath122 terms with @xmath123 .",
    "the number of terms / triplets in ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) rapidly increases with @xmath0 : for a three - swimmer the sum ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) contains the only triplet , for a four - swimmer  four triplets , for a five - swimmer  10 triplets , while for a ten - swimmer the number of triplets grows up to 120 . in general ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) contains @xmath124 $ ] triplets .",
    "it is important to emphasise that ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) contains _ all triplets _ in a micro - robot , not only triplets of the neighbouring spheres . if one takes into account only the triplets of the neighbouring spheres ( say , ( 1,2,3 ) and ( 2,3,4 ) out of @xmath125 for @xmath126 ) , then they give only the rough estimation of @xmath127 , which can be misleading since different correlations @xmath128 can have different values ( see below ) .",
    "function @xmath129 ( [ g ] ) has been introduced by @xcite and studied by @xcite in the context of a three - sphere micro - robot .",
    "we call @xmath130 _ a golestanian function_. formulae ( [ her]),([vel - self - prop - final+]),([g ] ) give the main result of this paper : the self - swimming velocity of an @xmath0-sphere micro - robot represents a linear combination of golestanian functions for all available triplets",
    ".      the explicit formulae ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) , ( [ g ] ) can be used to obtain physically interesting results ( optimal strokes , required power , related forces , efficiency , _ etc .",
    "_ ) for various @xmath0-sphere swimmers .",
    "we briefly address some of these questions below . in all these examples",
    ", we consider only homogeneous micro - robots , consisting of equal spheres @xmath131 and of equal upstretched arms @xmath132 .    the scalar product of the main equation ( [ exact-1-dless ] ) and @xmath133 leads to the average power of a micro - robot @xmath134 where we have taken into account that @xmath135 , which follows from ( [ x - f - ser ] ) and ( [ chain ] ) .",
    "another expression @xmath136 represents the power , which is required to drag a micro - robot with velocity @xmath127 in the absence of its oscillations ( when the main approximation for the dimensionless stokes s friction force is @xmath137 ) .",
    "lighthill s swimming efficiency ( see @xcite ) is the ratio @xmath138 , which in our case is @xmath139 where @xmath96 is determined by ( [ tilde - xc ] ) .    for * _ a three - swimmer _ * , eqns.([vel - self - prop - final+]),([g ] ) yield : @xmath140 further simplification can be achieved if we accept that oscillations of both arms are harmonic and have equal amplitudes @xmath141 with constant phases @xmath142 .",
    "substitution of ( [ 3-harm ] ) into ( [ 3-vel ] ) and ( [ eff ] ) gives @xmath143 which shows that their maxima take place at different @xmath144 : @xmath145 similar consideration for * _ a four - swimmer _ * yields @xmath146 which ( with the use of ( [ 3-harm ] ) ) leads to @xmath147 where @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "then ( [ eff ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath151 the computations show that : @xmath152    for * _ a five - swimmer _ * , one can write @xmath153 which leads to : @xmath154+(a+2c)\\sin(\\phi+\\psi+\\chi);\\nonumber\\\\ & & a=7/8,\\ b=41/18,\\ c=151/72;\\quad\\phi\\equiv\\varphi_1-\\varphi_2,\\ \\psi\\equiv \\varphi_2-\\varphi_3 , \\",
    "\\chi\\equiv \\varphi_3-\\varphi_4\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then ( [ eff ] ) takes form : @xmath155 the computations give : @xmath156 the numerical results ( [ 3-maxima])-([5-maxima ] ) show that both @xmath157 and @xmath158 grow when @xmath0 increases .",
    "for reasonably small values of parameters ( say , @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) we have @xmath161 , hence the efficiency of considered micro - robots is low .    in order to compare the velocities of micro - robots and micro - organisms we use the dimensional variables , in which @xmath162",
    "; it shows that ( for typical stroke frequency of self - swimming microorganisms , which is about several @xmath163 , see @xcite ) a micro - robot can move itself with the rate about @xmath164 percents of its own size per second .",
    "this estimation is @xmath165 times lower than a similar value for natural micro - swimmers , see @xcite ; it shows again low efficiency of considered micro - robots .",
    "if we suggest that the function @xmath166 grows with a similar rate ( as it has been calculated for @xmath116 ) , then micro - robots with @xmath167 could swim with a speed , similar to that of micro - organisms .",
    "\\1 . our approach ( based on the two - timing method and a distinguished limit ) is technically different from all previous methods employed in the studies of micro - robots .",
    "the possibility to derive explicit formulae for an @xmath0-sphere micro - robot shows its strength and analytical simplicity .",
    "the used version of the two - timing method has been developed in @xcite .",
    "one can see that @xmath168 ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) , which is the same as the result by @xcite for a three - sphere swimmer . at the same time",
    "our choice of slow time @xmath169 ( [ chain ] ) agrees with classical studies of self - propulsion for low reynolds numbers , see @xcite , as well as geometric studies of @xcite .",
    "the ` triplet ' structure of a formula for self - propulsion velocity ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) can be expected without any calculations , on the base of the result for @xmath170 . indeed ,",
    "if we are interested in the main term of the order @xmath171 , then only triple interactions can be taken into account , as they have been described by @xcite .",
    "for example , the interactions between four spheres produce a term of the next order @xmath172 in @xmath127 , where the multiplier @xmath173 appears from the motion of three arms involved .    \\4 . in our examples , all arms move harmonically ( [ 3-harm ] ) ; it does not provide the maximum of @xmath127 .",
    "for example , for a three - sphere robot @xmath174 ( [ 3-vel ] ) . since @xmath175 and @xmath176 represent mutually independent @xmath26-periodic in @xmath49 functions ,",
    "it is clear that the maximum of this correlation appears when these functions coincide or proportional to each other .",
    "if @xmath177 is calculated under the constraint of fixed amplitudes ( which is natural for realistic experimental devices of variable arm lengths ) , then one can find that the theoretical maximum of this correlation is @xmath178 , which is higher than @xmath179 for harmonic oscillations ( [ 3-harm ] ) .",
    "such an improvement will increase with the growth of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , non - harmonic periodic @xmath180 , providing the optimal strokes , have been discovered in computational studies of four - sphere micro - robots by @xcite .",
    "\\5 . in our study",
    "we build an asymptotic procedure with two small parameters : @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "such a setting usually requires the consideration of different asymptotic paths on the plane @xmath183 when , say @xmath184 . in our case",
    "we can avoid such consideration , since small parameters appear ( in the main order ) as a product @xmath171 .",
    "the mathematical justification of the presented results by the estimation of an error in the original equation can be performed similar to @xcite .",
    "one can also derive the higher approximations of @xmath127 , as it has been done by @xcite for different cases .",
    "the higher approximations can be useful for the studies of motion with @xmath185 ( say , if all correlations involved in ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) are zero ) .",
    "\\7 . in the literature quoted in _",
    "one can find interesting discussions about the physical mechanism of self - propulsion of micro - robots .",
    "a clear illustration of this mechanism is given by @xcite .",
    "at the same time one can notice that the self - propulsion of deformable bodies in inviscid fluid represents a classical topic , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the qualitative explanations of self - propulsion in an inviscid fluid and in self - propulsion in creeping flow can be seen as the same if one replaces the term _ virtual mass _ ( for an inviscid fluid ) to _ viscous drag _",
