    "during the last years , there have been an impressive amount of theoretical work on renormalons in different scenarios . for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations behind this effort concerns the non perturbative structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . on the other side , finite temperature effects",
    "have also called the attention of many authors @xcite , due to their crucial role in understanding thermal aspects of the hadron dynamics , whith special emphasis on the deconfining phase transition and the production of the quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "it seems natural , therefore , to start a systematic study of the occurrence and also the possible phenomenological role of thermal renormalons .",
    "here we discuss , as a first step in this direction , the scalar theory @xmath0 . in spite of being a non realistic approach for phenomenological purposes ,",
    "this analysis will allow us to gain a first impression on this kind of effects .",
    "the fundamental characteristic of a renormalon type diagram is an insertion of at least a chain of bubbles in a loop diagram , and behaves like @xmath1 for large values of @xmath2 , being @xmath2 the number of bubbles in the chain .",
    "these diagrams , in the usual zero temperature situation , induce the existence of certain types of poles in the borel plane . in this paper",
    "we explore in detail the extension to the finite temperature scenario of one kind of renormalon type feynman diagrams , see fig .",
    "1 , that contribute to the two - point function .",
    "the set of diagrams we have chosen is an example of a renormalon type contribution ( ultraviolet renormalons , uvr ) , and gives us a hint about the properties of the thermal borel plane , i.e. positions and residues of poles as a function of temperature .",
    "the discussion at finite temperature has been done using the machinery of thermo field dynamics ( tfd ) @xcite .",
    "the main result from our analysis is that residues can get an explicit dependence on temperature , remaining , nevertheless , the position of the poles in the borel plane unchanged .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the analysis at zero temperature of a particular set of feynman diagrams , see fig .",
    "1 , that contribute to the two - point function in the @xmath0 theory , allows us to show the presence of a renormalon type singularity in the borel plane .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a brief discussion of how to handle the chain of bubbles shown in fig .",
    "2 at finite temperature . this will be done in the deep euclidean region , i.e. @xmath3 , of the momentum @xmath4 that circulates through the chain of bubbles . using these results , in section 4",
    "we calculate our renormalon type diagram ( fig .",
    "1 ) at finite temperature and proceed to present our conclusions .",
    "in the present paper the diagram shown in fig . 1 will be taken as a source for renormalons .",
    "our goal is to explore the influence of temperature on this type of diagrams .",
    "let us call by @xmath5 the diagram of order @xmath2 , where @xmath2 denotes the number of vertices . in order to establish our notation",
    ", we will first review the zero temperature calculation for the renormalon asociated to this diagram @xcite .",
    "( 100,25 )    if we denote by @xmath6 the one loop correction to the four point function , the so called  fish \" diagram @xcite , we have    @xmath7^{k-1},\\ ] ]    where the @xmath8 factor is due to the double counting of vertices in @xmath6 .",
    "the relevant contribution to the integral comes from the deep euclidean region .",
    "therefore , it is enough to approximate @xmath6 in this region .",
    "@xmath9    @xmath10    ( the argument of the logarithm is in mass units )    in this way we have @xmath11    where a wick rotation has been performed .",
    "this expression is ultraviolet divergent . since @xmath12 is a renormalizable theory , we can concentrate on the finite part . in order to do this the propagator",
    "is expanded in powers of @xmath13 .",
    "the first two ultraviolet divergent terms are subtracted , and we keep only the first convergent term in the expansion .",
    "this procedure , which at the end induces one pole in the borel plane , i.e. one renormalon , will be followed also in the next sections , where the finite temperature corrections will be computed . due to this expansion , the dependence on @xmath4 , the external momentum of the two point function , actually dissapears .",
    "so we find    @xmath14    in the last expression we can see that the main contribution to @xmath15 , at large values of @xmath2 , comes from large values of @xmath16 , that corresponds to the deep euclidean region , since we have done a wick rotation . introducing the new variable @xmath17 , we can see that @xmath15 becomes proportional to the gamma function .",
    "@xmath18    let us remain breifly the idea of the borel transform .",
    "if , in general , we have a divergent series in terms of a certain expansion parameter @xmath19 , of the form :    @xmath20=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty d_na^n,\\ ] ]    then , one possibility to give a meaning to this series is to make use of the borel transform method @xcite , according to which a new perturbative expansion , in a new expansion parameter b , is considered by dividing each coefficient of the previous series by @xmath21 in the following way    @xmath22 = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty d_{n+1}\\frac{b^n}{n!}.\\ ] ]    formally , we see that the @xmath23 $ ] corresponds to the laplace transform of @xmath24 $ ] .",

    "the meaning of this or other poles in the borel plane corresponds to an ambiguity in the resummation of the series .",
    "physically , this imply the existence of essential errors associated to perturbatives expansions of physical magnitudes .",
    "in this section we revise the finite temperature calculation for the chain of bubbles shown in fig .",
    "2 , which contribute to the four - point function .",
    "the original discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "later we will approximate our result for deep euclidean values of the momentum that goes through the chain .",
    "let us denote by @xmath26 the sum of all diagrams of the form shown in fig .",
    "2 , with @xmath2 bubbles and fixed external vertices of type one , according to the rules of tfd , including a global imaginary factor @xmath27 .",
    "the sum is over all possible combinations of internal type of vertices , which , as we know , can be of first or second type .",

    "what follows , we will examine the chain of bubbles in the deep euclidean region at finite temperature , assuming @xmath48 .",
    "later , by replacing the explicit expression for our chain of bubbles shown in fig . 1 , we will check if the previous condition , @xmath47 , is actually realized .",

    "we can take @xmath61 .",
    "the real part , then , can be written as a series in powers of @xmath62    @xmath63    where the coefficients , which in our limit turn out to be essentially independent of the external momentum , are given by    @xmath64    using the previous results in eq .",

    "1 will be calculated in the frame of tfd . at finite temperature",

    "as it was the case in the chain of bubbles , the sum is over all possible combinations of internal type of vertices . in order to use our expression for @xmath26 ,",
    "this sum must be performed before the integral over the internal momentum that circulates through the chain of bubbles . here",
    "we will obtain an expression for @xmath78 , finding the location of the induced poles in the borel plane and the corresponding residues .",

    "note that the assumption we made in the previous section , @xmath47 , has changed now in the second term , due to the factor 2 in the exponential .",
    "this fact does not affect our approximations .",

    "the conclusions from the particular diagram we have discussed here , suggest us to conjecture that these will be actually general properties of the borel plane associated to correlation functions at finite temperature : residues , in general , will depend on temperature being , however , the location of the poles temperature independent .",
    "thermal renormalons in the scalar theory are always subleading in the ambiguity of borel sum , i.e. the leading pole is temperature independent .",
    "this fact is related to the ultraviolet character of the renormalons in this theory .",
    "thermal corrections are associated to long distance correlations in the system , whereas the leading renormalons come from the singular behavior at short distances .",
