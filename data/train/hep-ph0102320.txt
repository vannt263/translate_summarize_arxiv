    "majorana neutrino masses require a new mechanism of neutrino mass generation that is beyond the standard model .",
    "one of the most popular mechanisms of neutrino mass generation is the see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is based on the assumption that the law of conservation of lepton number is violated at a scale that is much larger then the scale of violation of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "the see - saw mechanism allows to connect the smallness of neutrino masses with a large physical scale that characterizes the violation of the lepton number conservation law .    in order to reveal the dirac or majorana nature of neutrinos",
    "it is necessary to study neutrino mass effects .",
    "it is impossible to distinguish massive dirac and majorana neutrinos through the investigation of neutrino oscillations @xcite . indeed , in the case of neutrino mixing the leptonic cc current has the form @xmath201 if @xmath11 are dirac fields , the mixing matrix @xmath13 is determined up to the transformation @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "this is due to the fact that the phases of dirac fields are arbitrary .    in the case of majorana neutrinos",
    ", the majorana condition ( [ 064 ] ) does not allow to include arbitrary phases into the fields .",
    "thus , in the majorana case the mixing matrix @xmath13 is determined only up to the transformation @xmath205 from eqs .",
    "( [ 066 ] ) and ( [ 067 ] ) it follows that the number of physical cp - violating phases in the dirac and majorana cases are different families the number of physical phases in the case of dirac neutrinos is @xmath206 ( in this case the number of phases is the same as in the quark case ) . in the case of majorana neutrinos",
    "the number of the physical phases is larger : @xmath207 , _ i.e. _ there are @xmath208 additional phases . ] .    from eq .",
    "( [ 021 ] ) one can see that under both transformation ( [ 066 ] ) and ( [ 067 ] ) the amplitude of @xmath80 transitions is transformed as @xmath209 and the probability of @xmath80 transitions is invariant under the transformation ( [ 068 ] ) .",
    "this means that the transition probability is independent from the additional phases in the majorana case .    the most promising process that allows to investigate the nature of massive neutrino ( dirac or majorana ?",
    ") is neutrinoless double-@xmath36 decay of even - even nuclei : @xmath210    the diagram of this process is depicted in fig .",

    "( [ 070 ] ) it follows that in the case of small neutrino masses the matrix element of neutrinoless double-@xmath36 decay is proportional to @xmath212 thus , the process ( [ 069 ] ) is allowed if neutrinos are majorana particles and massive .",
    "notice that neutrino mixing is not required for that decay is suppressed because of the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "if there is no mixing ( _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath13 is the unit matrix ) , @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is the majorana mass of @xmath3 . in neutron decay",
    "both right - handed and left - handed majorana electron neutrinos are emitted together with @xmath176 s .",
    "the amplitude of the production of left - handed neutrinos is proportional to @xmath215 ( @xmath33 is the neutrino energy ) .",
    "the left - handed majorana neutrino can be absorbed by another neutron in a nucleus with the production of another @xmath176 .",
    "the amplitude of absorption of right - handed neutrinos is proportional to @xmath215 .",
    "hence , the amplitude of neutrinoless double @xmath36-decay is proportional to @xmath216 for typical nuclear energies @xmath217 . ] .",
    "neutrinoless double-@xmath36 is a process of second order in the fermi constant @xmath218 .",
    "its matrix element is proportional to small neutrino masses .",
    "the expected lifetime of neutrinoless double-@xmath36 decay is much larger than the lifetime of usual @xmath36-decays .",
    "however , because of the clear signature of the process ( two electrons with definite total energy in the final state ) , several experiments have obtained very large lower bounds for the lifetime of neutrinoless double-@xmath36 decay of different nuclei ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the lower limits for the lifetimes of @xmath219ge and @xmath220xe obtained in the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite and in the gotthard experiment @xcite are @xmath221 these limits imply upper bounds for the effective majorana mass @xmath222 , with values that depend on the calculation of nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the results of different calculations lead to the limits @xmath223 several new experiments searching for neutrinoless double-@xmath36 decay are in preparation .",
    "these future experiments are planned to be sensitive to values of @xmath222 @xmath224 @xcite , or even @xmath225 @xcite .",
    "the results of neutrino oscillation experiments give information on neutrino masses and on the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the possible values of @xmath226 , depend , among others , on the character of the neutrino mass spectrum , on the real existence of the oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment , and on the absolute values of neutrino masses ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if the results of the lsnd experiment will not be confirmed by future experiments , all the other neutrino data can be explained by the existence of only three massive and mixed neutrinos .",
    "if there is a hierarchy of neutrino masses , @xmath227 there is a stringent upper bound for the effective majorana mass @xcite : @xmath228    in the case of an `` inverted hierarchy '' , @xmath229 the upper bound for the effective majorana mass is less stringent @xcite : @xmath230    if the evidence in favor of short - baseline @xmath231 oscillations obtained in the lsnd experiment will be confirmed by other experiments , the effective majorana mass could be as large as @xmath232 or smaller than @xmath225 , depending on the neutrino mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "we have discussed the notion of lepton numbers in the case of neutrino mixing . we have stressed that the existence of neutrino oscillations means that there are no conserved family lepton numbers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "the flavor neutrinos @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 participate in weak interactions ( @xmath4 is produced together with a @xmath124 in @xmath154 decay , etc . ) . in the case of _ small _ neutrino masses",
    "the states of flavor neutrinos are superpositions of the states of neutrinos @xmath11 with definite masses .",
    "flavor neutrinos are not quanta of any field and they have no definite masses .    we have discussed the difference between different flavor neutrino discovery experiments . the results of @xmath6 and @xmath7 oscillation experiments clearly demonstrate that @xmath5 is a new type of flavor neutrino , different from @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 has been detected directly in the recent donut experiment .",
    "we have stressed that a conserved lepton number @xmath34 can exist only if massive neutrinos are dirac particles . in this case",
    "the electron , muon , tau - lepton and massive neutrinos @xmath11 have the same values of @xmath34 . the lepton number @xmath34 distinguishes neutrinos from antineutrinos .",
    "different neutrinos differ by the value of their masses .    if massive neutrinos are majorana particles there are no conserved lepton numbers .",
    "the search for neutrinoless double-@xmath36 decay is the most promising method to test the conservation of lepton number in the case of neutrino mixing .",
