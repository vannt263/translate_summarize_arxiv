    "<S> the fit to resonance parameters is also made simultaneously to data on @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 reported earlier [ 2,3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> this combined fit is constrained strongly by the requirement of consistency between channels and gives accurate determinations of masses and widths of most resonances found in the data . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , there is evidence for a broad @xmath47 component with @xmath48 mev , @xmath49 mev . </S>",
    "<S> tensor splitting for @xmath50 states is , within sizeable errors , consistent with that predicted from one - gluon exchange and a linear confining potential . </S>",
