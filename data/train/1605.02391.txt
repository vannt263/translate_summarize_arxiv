    "a @xmath2 gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions , coupled to a single massless dirac fermion @xmath3 of charge 1 , is invariant at the classical level under time - reversal and reflection symmetry , which we will call @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , quantum mechanically there is an anomaly : to quantize this theory in a gauge - invariant fashion , one must give up @xmath4 and @xmath5 symmetry @xcite . this anomaly is commonly called a `` parity '' anomaly , but this terminology is somewhat misleading as parity ( a spatial inversion , acting as @xmath6 on all spatial coordinates ) is in the connected component of the rotation group in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "the anomaly is better understood as an anomaly in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a refinement of the usual `` parity '' anomaly .",
    "we will make this analysis for arbitrary gauge groups , but for gauge group @xmath2 , what we will learn can be stated as follows .",
    "the usual statement of the anomaly is that a @xmath2 gauge theory in @xmath0 dimensions coupled to a single dirac fermion @xmath3 of charge 1 can not be quantized in a gauge - invariant way , consistent with @xmath5 and @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "if one has two such dirac fermions , both of charge 1 , then the usual `` parity '' anomaly is absent and , on an orientable manifold , the theory can be quantized in a way that preserves @xmath2 gauge - invariance as well as @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath4 were ordinary global symmetries ( not acting on spacetime ) , one would now ask : can these symmetries be gauged ? in general for ordinary global symmetries , the answer to such a question can be `` no '' : even if the symmetries are valid as global symmetries , there may be an anomaly ( sometimes called an t hooft anomaly ) that would obstruct gauging them . for @xmath5 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the closest analog of gauging the symmetry is to use these symmetries to formulate a theory on an unorientable manifold . or @xmath4",
    "symmetry can be formulated on an unorientable manifold , we say that @xmath5 or @xmath4 is gaugeable , while actually gauging the symmetry in the context of quantum gravity would mean summing over unorientable manifolds . ] therefore , to get a refined version of the usual `` parity '' anomaly , we can consider a @xmath2 gauge theory with a general number @xmath7 of dirac fermions of charge 1 , and ask for what values of @xmath7 this theory can be placed on an unorientable manifold without violating gauge - invariance .",
    "we shall answer this question and find that @xmath7 must be a multiple of 4 .",
    "thus while the usual `` parity '' anomaly is a mod 2 effect , its refinement in which one `` gauges '' @xmath5 and @xmath4 symmetry is really a mod 4 effect .",
    "the existence of this refinement should not come as a surprise , since the purely gravitational analog is already known .-",
    "dimensional @xmath4-invariant @xmath2 gauge theory with @xmath8 dirac fermions of charge 1 is anomalous from the standpoint of condensed matter physics .",
    "the basic monopole operator of this theory , defined by a monopole singularity of charge 1 , is a bosonic operator that transforms under @xmath4 as a kramers doublet .",
    "this is not possible in a purely @xmath0-dimensional system that is built microscopically from electrons and nuclei .",
    "we discuss this issue in section [ monop ] . ]",
    "consider a theory of @xmath9 majorana fermions , coupled to gravity only .",
    "as long as one is on an orientable manifold , the fermion path integral of this system is real in euclidean signature ( because the dirac operator is hermitian ) .",
    "one should worry about a possible problem in defining the _ sign _ of the fermion path integral . however , as long as @xmath9 is even  to ensure that the path integral is positive  the theory of @xmath9 majorana fermions is completely well - defined and @xmath5- and @xmath4-invariant on an orientable manifold .",
    "in this introduction , we take all @xmath9 fermions @xmath10 to transform in the same way under @xmath4 or @xmath5 . specifically , we define @xmath4 by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where here @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the dirac gamma matrices , and similarly for @xmath5 .",
    "a fermion transforming with the opposite sign  as @xmath15  would make a contribution to the anomaly with the opposite sign .",
    "in general , @xmath9 should be defined as the number of fermions that transform with a @xmath16 sign minus the number that transform with a @xmath17 sign . for more on this ,",
    "see @xcite , as well as section [ analysis ] below .",
    "] can the @xmath5 and @xmath4 symmetries be gauged , or more precisely is the theory well - defined when formulated on an unorientable manifold ?",
    "the answer to this question is that when the theory of @xmath9 majorana fermions is formulated on an unorientable manifold , one runs into an anomaly that involves an eighth root of 1 in the simplest calculations @xcite , and a sixteenth root of 1 in a more systematic analysis ( see section 4 of @xcite ) .    the mod 16 anomaly for @xmath0-dimensional majorana fermions coupled to gravity only is intimately related to the theory of a topological superconductor in @xmath18 dimensions .",
    "a topological superconductor in @xmath18 dimensions is characterized by an invariant usually called @xmath9 ; in euclidean signature , it has a bulk partition function @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the eta - invariant of the four - dimensional dirac operator .",
    "one can think of this factor , which was suggested in @xcite , as coming from integrating out @xmath9 bands .",
    "] of gapped bulk fermions @xcite . here",
    "@xmath21 is a topological invariant if the worldvolume @xmath22 of the topological superconductor has no boundary ; it is the partition function of a topological field theory defined on closed four - dimensional spin ( or more precisely @xmath23 ) manifolds .",
    "this invariant is in general an arbitrary 16@xmath24 root of 1 , so @xmath19 is trivial ( for all @xmath22 ) if and only if @xmath9 is divisible by 16 . but what happens if @xmath22 has a boundary ? then , if @xmath9 is not a multiple of 16 , @xmath19 can not be defined as a topological invariant . however ,",
    "if we include @xmath9 massless majorana fermions on the boundary of @xmath22 ( and transforming under @xmath4 as in footnote [ howth ] ) , the anomaly of the fermions compensates for the ill - definedness of the bulk partition function and the combined system is well - defined and anomaly - free . in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the generalization of this construction to include gauge fields  either gauge fields that propagate in @xmath18 dimensions , or gauge fields that propagate only on the boundary of a four - manifold .    in band theory , and",
    "as we have defined it above , @xmath9 is an integer , but when fermion interactions in the bulk theory are taken into account , it is known from several points of view @xcite that @xmath9 is only an invariant mod 16 .",
    "one way to understand this is the fact that the partition function of the bulk theory and the anomaly of the boundary theory depend only on the value of @xmath9 mod 16 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we analyze the general `` parity '' anomaly for gauge fields on an unorientable manifold , provided the reader is willing to take a few statements on faith . ] in section [ analysis ] . in the remainder of the paper , we describe two applications of the result , one in condensed matter physics and one in string / m - theory .    in section [ gb ] , we use our results to construct gapped , symmetry - preserving boundary states of a topological superconductor . such states and analogous ones for topological insulators and for certain bosonic states of matter",
    "have been analyzed in the literature from various points of view@xcite .",
    "we use here the same methods as in @xcite and our basic examples were already analyzed there .",
    "however , having a more complete knowledge of which models are anomaly - free enables us to be more precise on some points , and in particular , it will help us to construct in a straightforward way a gapped and topologically trivial boundary state at @xmath1 .",
    "( if one incorrectly believed that the `` parity '' anomaly is a mod 2 effect even on an unorientable manifold , one would incorrectly infer the existence of a gapped and topologically trivial boundary state at @xmath25 . )",
    "we primarily consider models that are gapped at the perturbative level , but in section [ confinement ] , we consider models that are gapped with the help of nonperturbative effects . here",
    "we give two related constructions , both at @xmath1 , one of which uses the mass gap of @xmath26 gauge theory and one of which uses the polyakov model @xcite of compact qed in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "( an interpolation between different bulk states at @xmath1 using nonperturbative properties of four - dimensional gauge theory has been described in @xcite . )    in section [ mtheory ] , we apply some of the same ideas to a problem in string / m - theory .",
    "it has been known @xcite that the `` parity '' anomaly in @xmath0 dimensions has implications for m2-branes ( membranes with @xmath0-dimensional worldvolume that arise in m - theory ) .",
    "in fact , the fermions that propagate on the m2-brane worldvolume do have an anomaly , which has to be canceled by a version of anomaly inflow @xcite involving a shifted quantization law of the three - form field of m - theory .",
    "in the past , this analysis has been made only for the case that the m2-brane worldvolume is orientable .",
    "here we analyze the unorientable case , showing that , with a slightly refined statement of the shifted quantization law , anomalies still cancel .",
    "( previously , the path integral on an unorientable string worldsheet has been analyzed in @xcite . ) a short summary of the paper can be found in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a general comment .",
    "apart from technical details , the analysis in this paper differs in the following way from more familiar discussions of the `` parity '' anomaly . on an orientable manifold ,",
    "the usual `` parity '' anomaly is a conflict between @xmath4 or @xmath5 symmetry and gauge invariance .",
    "however , when we use @xmath5 symmetry to formulate a theory on an unorientable manifold ( we work in euclidean signature so @xmath5 is more relevant here than @xmath4 ) , that symmetry is built in and it is too late to give it up .",
    "so the anomalies we compute on unorientable manifolds represent breakdowns of gauge symmetry or diffeomorphism symmetry rather than conflicts between those local symmetries and @xmath4 or @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "in this paper , we will consider fermions on a @xmath0-dimensional manifold @xmath27 interacting with gauge fields of some gauge group @xmath28 and with gravity . in the main condensed matter application",
    ", @xmath27 will be the boundary of a four - manifold @xmath22 that will be the worldvolume of a topological superconductor and @xmath28 will be a group of emergent gauge fields that propagate only along @xmath27 ( and not @xmath22 ) . in the string / m - theory example , @xmath27 will be the worldvolume of an m2-brane , and @xmath28 will be the structure group of the normal bundle to @xmath27 in the full higher - dimensional spacetime .    in either case , we consider gauge fields @xmath29 that transform under time - reversal @xmath4 in the natural - looking way @xmath30 in terms of differential forms , if @xmath31 is the time - reversal transformation of spacetime @xmath32 , eqn .",
    "( [ transf ] ) would be written @xmath33 .",
    "these conditions imply that the gauge charge ( which couples to @xmath34 ) is odd under @xmath4 , and the `` magnetic '' flux ( the integral of @xmath35 ) is even .",
    "this behavior under @xmath4 will be assumed for all gauge fields considered in the present paper .    the choice in eqn .",
    "( [ transf ] ) really requires some explanation . in nature",
    ", there is also an operation @xmath36 of charge conjugation , so there are two possible time - reversal operations , namely @xmath4 and @xmath37 .",
    "the usual convention in particle physics and condensed matter physics is that the gauge field @xmath38 of electromagnetism transforms under @xmath4 with an opposite sign to eqn .",
    "( [ transf ] )  thus @xmath39 , as opposed to @xmath40 .",
    "this definition ensures that electric charge is @xmath4-even .",
    "by contrast , the choice ( [ transf ] ) means that the conserved charge @xmath41 that couples to @xmath34 is @xmath4-odd .",
    "a rationale for the choice ( [ transf ] ) is that in the present paper , we will consider problems in which there is no natural operation corresponding to @xmath36 . since @xmath36 reverses the sign of the electric charge , and electric charge is not conserved in a superconductor , operation . to say it differently",
    ", a superconductor has fermionic quasiparticles but there is not a meaningful sense in which their electric charge is positive or negative . in terms of the electromagnetic gauge field @xmath38 , one would say that in a superconductor , as @xmath42 is broken to @xmath43 , @xmath38 becomes a @xmath43 gauge field , so that @xmath44 is gauge - equivalent to 0 at long distances and the operation @xmath45 is irrelevant . from a macroscopic point of view",
    ", this is true even in the presence of flux lines . a fermionic excitation propagates around a flux line with a change of sign regardless of whether the flux line has flux @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "] there is no natural @xmath36 operation in the theory of a topological superconductor .",
    "likewise , in the string / m - theory problem , there is no operation corresponding to @xmath36 .    since there will be no analog of @xmath36 in the problems that we will consider",
    ", we will simply refer to the transformation ( [ transf ] ) as @xmath4 .",
    "actually , to analyze anomalies , which will be our goal in the present section , it is convenient to work in euclidean signature . here we consider a spatial reflection rather than time - reversal .",
    "we take @xmath5 to act by reflection of one coordinate @xmath48 equivalently , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the spatial reflection @xmath51 .",
    "thus , in going to an unorientable manifold , we will consider gauge fields @xmath29 that transform under an orientation - reversing diffeomorphism @xmath50 as @xmath52 .",
    "as we will see , this leads to a richer structure than the familiar `` parity '' anomaly that is seen on an orientable manifold .",
    "by contrast , if one uses @xmath53 to go to an unorientable manifold ( for example , by considering a @xmath42 gauge field @xmath29 that transforms under an orientation - reversing diffeomorphism as @xmath54 ) , then one finds only the standard `` parity '' anomaly .",
    "this has been explained in section 4.7 of @xcite .",
    "that is why the considerations of the present paper are more directly relevant to topological superconductors ( and m - theory ) rather than to topological insulators .",
    "we reiterate that in this paper , we consider theories that have no natural @xmath36 operation at the microscopic level so the discrete symmetries are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "should we contemplate the possibility of @xmath36 as an emergent symmetry ?",
    "in general , _",
    "exact _ emergent symmetries are gauge symmetries ; an emergent @xmath36 symmetry , if it is an exact symmetry , would be part of the emergent gauge group and could be incorporated as such in the analysis that follows .",
    "it is certainly possible to have _ approximate _ emergent global symmetries , but an approximate @xmath36 symmetry would not be relevant in the present paper ; for example , we can not use @xmath53 in putting a theory on an unorientable manifold unless @xmath55 is an exact symmetry .",
    "a final comment is that what we call @xmath4 and @xmath5 in this paper correspond more closely to what are usually called @xmath37 and @xmath5 , respectively , when electric charge conservation is relevant and in theories with a microscopic @xmath36 symmetry .",
    "for example , what we call @xmath4 was called @xmath37 in sections 2 - 5 of @xcite , which are devoted to a topological insulator ( in which electric charge is conserved ) .",
    "it was called @xmath56 in section 6 of that paper , which is devoted to a topological superconductor . ] in a theory that does have a microscopic @xmath36 symmetry , analytic continuation from lorentz signature to euclidean signature relates @xmath37 to @xmath5 and @xmath4 to @xmath55 .      in general , there is a choice of sign in the transformation of a @xmath0-dimensional fermion field @xmath57 under @xmath4 : @xmath58 we note that for either choice of sign , one has @xmath59 ( here @xmath60 is the operator that counts the number of fermions mod 2 )",
    ". however , the two choices are physically inequivalent ; no linear transformation of @xmath57 would reverse this sign .    there is a similar sign choice in the transformation under a spatial reflection . in euclidean signature [ ilb]((x_1,x_2,x_3))=_1(-x_1,x_2,x_3 ) . in a relativistic theory , the signs in eqns .",
    "( [ zilb ] ) and ( [ ilb ] ) can be equated , as the @xmath61 theorem can be dropped if gauge fields transform under @xmath4 and @xmath5 as stated in eqns .",
    "( [ transf ] ) and ( [ transtwo ] ) .",
    "what we are calling @xmath4 is called @xmath37 in the usual statement of the theorem , so what is usually called @xmath61 reduces to @xmath62 with our choices . as explained in section [ preliminaries ] ,",
    "we are using conventions that are more natural in a context ( such as the theory of a topological superconductor ) in which there is no natural @xmath36 operation . ]",
    "ensures that a theory has a @xmath4 symmetry with a given choice of sign if and only if it has an @xmath5 symmetry with the same choice of sign .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0-dimensional massless majorana fermions @xmath63 transforming in an @xmath64-dimensional real massless majorana fermions in @xmath0 dimensions is @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath28 is necessarily a subgroup of @xmath65 and the representation @xmath66 is the vector representation of @xmath65 , restricted to @xmath28 .",
    "this is a real representation because the vector representation of @xmath65 is real . ]",
    "representation @xmath66 of a gauge group @xmath28 , and all transforming under @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) with a + sign .",
    "we want to know whether this theory makes sense as a purely @xmath0-dimensional theory , and to measure the anomaly if it does not . we will schematically call that anomaly @xmath67 .",
    "one can think of this anomaly as the change in phase of the path integral under a diffeomorphism and/or gauge transformation , though we also come later to a more powerful way to think about it involving topological field theory .",
    "alternatively , we could assume that the fermions @xmath68 transform under @xmath4 and @xmath5 with a minus sign .",
    "this complex conjugates the path integral , so it changes the sign of the anomaly , replacing @xmath67 with @xmath69 .",
    "more generally , we could have one set of fermions @xmath63 transforming in the representation @xmath66 of @xmath28 , and transforming under @xmath4 with a + sign , and a second set @xmath70 transforming in some possibly different representation @xmath71 of @xmath28 , and transforming under @xmath4 with a @xmath17 sign .",
    "the net anomaly is then @xmath72 .",
    "clearly , then , to understand the anomaly for an arbitrary system of fermions , it suffices to compute @xmath67 , that is , it suffices to consider a system of fermions @xmath68 that all transform under @xmath4 with a @xmath16 sign .",
    "formally , the path integral @xmath73 of a system of fermions , with dirac operator @xmath74 , is the pfaffian @xmath75 .",
    "our approach to computing the anomaly will be based on the dai - freed theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem gives a recipe ( in euclidean signature ) to define @xmath73 in a gauge - invariant fashion , compatible with general physical principles such as unitarity , once some auxiliary choices are made .",
    "one then has to check whether the result does depend on the choices .",
    "if it does not , then one has succeeded in finding a satisfactory definition of @xmath73 and the @xmath0-dimensional theory is anomaly - free . if @xmath73 as defined by the theorem does depend on the auxiliary choices , then the theory is anomalous , and its anomaly can be measured by how the theory depends on the choices .",
    "let @xmath27 be a compact three - manifold endowed with a @xmath23 structure structure is the generalization of a spin structure on a possibly unorientable manifold , for fermions with @xmath59 .",
    "see appendix a of @xcite for an introduction . ] and a background gauge field .",
    "suppose that we wish to calculate the path integral @xmath73 of the fermions @xmath68 on a possibly unorientable three - manifold @xmath27 of euclidean signature .",
    "the dai - freed theorem gives us a definition of @xmath73 once we are given a four - dimensional manifold @xmath22 with boundary @xmath27 such that the @xmath23 structure and the metric and gauge field on @xmath27 all extend over @xmath22 .",
    "the definition is [ torof]z_=|()|(-i_r/2 ) .",
    "here @xmath76 is the atiyah - patodi - singer @xcite eta - invariant of the dirac operator acting on four - dimensional majorana fermions in the representation @xmath66 of @xmath28 , and @xmath77 is simply the absolute value of @xmath75 ( this absolute value is always anomaly - free for an arbitrary fermion system ) .",
    "mathematically , the justification for the formula is as follows .",
    "first , the right hand side is well - defined and gauge - invariant .",
    "second , the variation of the right hand side is as expected : that is , its variation in a change in the background metric or gauge field on @xmath22 depends only on the fields along @xmath27 and is given by the ( regularized ) one - point function of the stress tensor or current in the fermion theory on @xmath27 , as expected .",
    "an important consequence of the second point is that the right hand side vanishes precisely when @xmath73 is expected to vanish , namely for metrics and gauge fields such that @xmath78 has a zero - mode ; and moreover , it varies smoothly near such a point in field space ( this is required in order for the formula to be physically sensible , and is nontrivial as neither @xmath77 nor @xmath79 varies smoothly near such a point ) . finally , in view of the gluing theorem for the eta - invariant @xcite , which will be described below , the right hand side has a behavior under cutting and pasting that is compatible with physical principles such as unitarity .",
    "physically , one might interpret the formula ( [ torof ] ) as follows , by analogy with standard constructions in topological band theory @xcite .",
    "consider on @xmath22 a gapped system with @xmath28 symmetry consisting of massive majorana fermions @xmath80 transforming in the representation @xmath66 of @xmath28 .",
    "for one sign are accompanied by regulator fields @xmath81 of opposite statistics .",
    "the trivial case is that @xmath80 and @xmath81 have mass parameters of the same sign , and the nontrivial case is that the mass parameters have opposite signs .",
    "] of the @xmath80 mass parameter , this theory is topologically trivial and can be given a boundary condition such that the theory remains gapped along the boundary .",
    "for the opposite sign of the @xmath80 mass parameter , the bulk theory is topologically nontrivial , and gapless @xmath0 dimensional majorana fermions  with the properties of the fields that we have called @xmath68  appear on the boundary .",
    "the formula ( [ torof ] ) for @xmath73 should be understood as the partition function for the combined system comprising the gapped fermions @xmath80 in bulk and the gapless fermions @xmath68 on the boundary .    on a compact four - manifold @xmath22 without boundary ,",
    "the @xmath80 path integral ( after removing nonuniversal local terms ) would be @xmath82 .",
    "this fact goes back in essence to @xcite and has been exploited in several recent papers @xcite .",
    "the right hand side is a topological invariant ( invariant , that is , under continuous variation of the metric and gauge field on @xmath22 ) .",
    "indeed , the aps index theorem @xcite implies is a topological invariant except that it jumps by @xmath83 when an eigenvalue of the dirac operator passes through 0 . in four dimensions , for a real representation @xmath66 ( which we have here since the @xmath0-dimensional fermions that we started with are always in a real representation of @xmath28 ) , the eigenvalues of the dirac operator have even multiplicity because of a version of kramers doubling .",
    "so the jumps are by @xmath84 and @xmath76 is a topological invariant mod 4 . ] that @xmath76 is a topological invariant mod 4 , so that @xmath79 is a topological invariant .",
    "in fact @xmath79 is not just a topological invariant , but a cobordism invariant ( it equals 1 if @xmath22 is the boundary of a five - dimensional @xmath23 manifold over which the @xmath28-bundle over @xmath22 extends ) .",
    "this again follows from the aps index theorem .",
    "cobordism invariance implies @xcite that @xmath79 is the partition function of a topological field theory ( defined on a four - dimensional @xmath23 manifold endowed with a @xmath28-bundle ) .",
    "cobordism invariance of the eta - invariant in four dimensions motivated the conjecture in @xcite that this function would be relevant to fermionic spt phases .    however ,",
    "if @xmath22 is a manifold with nonempty boundary @xmath27 , then it is not possible to define @xmath76 to make @xmath79 a topological invariant .",
    "this means that there is a problem in defining on a manifold with boundary the topological field theory that on a manifold without boundary has partition function @xmath79 .",
    "this problem does not have a unique solution ; the topological field theory in question has different possible boundary states .",
    "however , it always has one simple gapless boundary state , in which majorana fermions in the representation @xmath66 propagate on the boundary .",
    "@xmath85 is the partition function of the theory on @xmath22 with this boundary state along @xmath27 . here",

    "@xmath79 is a topological invariant ; on a four - manifold with boundary , it is not a topological invariant , but varies in such a way that it makes sense in conjunction with the boundary fermions in the combination @xmath86 .",
    "now we can discuss whether the theory of the @xmath0-dimensional massless fermions @xmath68 on @xmath27 makes sense as a purely @xmath0-dimensional theory . in the present framework , this amounts to asking whether the formula @xmath87 depends on the choices that were made in defining @xmath76 .",

    ", we have the gluing or factorization property [ luth](ii^y_)(ii^y_)=(ii_^y^ * ) which is intimately connected with locality and unitarity in physics .",

    "since @xmath129 is an even integer , @xmath130 can be written in a manifestly real ( and thus @xmath4-invariant ) form as @xmath131 .",
    "the anomaly is thus a mod 2 question , involving evenness or oddness of the integer @xmath132 , just as in more traditional treatments of the `` parity '' anomaly .",

    "since we also assume that @xmath234 is massive in this phase , it follows that in this phase , the only gapless modes are @xmath9 majorana fermions transforming with a @xmath16 sign under @xmath4 ( or @xmath229 transforming with a @xmath16 sign and @xmath228 transforming with a @xmath17 sign , for some @xmath228 ; once the gauge symmetry is completely broken , such extra modes can combine and get masses ) .",

    "reducing to ground states of @xmath340 , we can eliminate @xmath341 and @xmath338 and replace @xmath309 with a subspace of one - half the dimension on which @xmath342 acts with the same sign as before .",

    "charge 1 , @xmath233 has spin 1/2 , so the state @xmath346 has spin @xmath347 mod 1 . since @xmath233 is a kramers singlet under @xmath4 , and has charge 1 , it is a kramers doublet of @xmath308 . from eqn .",

    "so @xmath346 is a gauge - invariant state of spin @xmath347 mod 1 that transforms under @xmath350 with a sign @xmath351 .",
    "the condition that this state is either a kramers singlet boson or a kramers doublet fermion is that @xmath284 should be even .",

    "even is the same as requiring that the total number @xmath7 of dirac fermions of odd charge is a multiple of 4 .",
    "this was the condition found in section [ examples ] for the theory to be completely free of gauge anomaly on an unorientable manifold .",
    "as in our discussion of the even charge case , once we have found a monopole operator @xmath353 that is either a kramers singlet boson or a kramers doublet fermion , by acting if necessary with a gauge - invariant kramers doublet fermion @xmath354 , we get a monopole operator @xmath355 that is a kramers singlet boson .",
    "so such an operator exists whenever the generalized `` parity '' anomaly is absent .",
    "we turn next to examples for various values of @xmath9 .      the most minimal model with @xmath356",
    "was analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "one simply introduces one @xmath3 field with some charge @xmath121 , and to make a mass term possible , one takes @xmath234 to have charge @xmath357 .",
    "one chooses @xmath121 to be an even number @xmath358 to avoid the `` parity '' anomaly . as we know from section [ examples ] , this gives a theory with no gauge anomaly , not even the more subtle anomaly that can only be detected on an unorientable manifold .",
    "since @xmath234 has charge @xmath298 , the expectation value of @xmath234 reduces the gauge symmetry from @xmath2 to @xmath359 . the low energy theory",
    ", however , is not just a @xmath359 gauge theory . in a vortex field",
    ", there is a single majorana fermion zero - mode . as a result ,",

    "for any even @xmath360 , one simple approach is to introduce @xmath284 @xmath3 fields , all with the same even charge and coupled in the same way to @xmath234 .",
    "this family of models was discussed in section 6.3 of @xcite for odd @xmath361 , corresponding to @xmath362 . as long as one is on an orientable manifold , the resulting topological field theories are the same , but they have four different actions of @xmath4 ( mainly because of subtleties in the quantization of the vortices ) .",
    "on an unorientable manifold , these models are inequivalent at low energies , as is clear both from the different values of @xmath9 and from the different actions of @xmath4 .    for @xmath9 congruent to 2 mod 4 , the unbroken gauge symmetry is always @xmath359 for some integer @xmath228 , even if the @xmath3 fields do not all have the same charge .",
    "this follows from the constraints of avoiding the `` parity '' anomaly and ensuring that all fermions gain mass from the gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "( if @xmath234 has charge @xmath363 for some integer @xmath228 , then , to give masses to all @xmath3 fields , the number of @xmath3 fields with odd charge will have to be odd , leading to a `` parity '' anomaly . ) in general , if formulated on an orientable manifold , the @xmath359 gauge theory has a chern - simons ( or dijkgraaf - witten @xcite ) term , as analyzed in @xcite .      for @xmath364 , we need two @xmath3 fields . naively they can both have odd charge , avoiding the usual `` parity '' anomaly , but we learned in section [ examples ] that this will actually lead to a more subtle gauge anomaly .",

    ", we have to double the rank of the @xmath23 bundle .",
    "there is a straightforward construction .",

    "what is the effect of this sign reversal ? reversing the signs of @xmath13 and @xmath718 , @xmath719 , is not very consequential since one can compensate for this by conjugating by @xmath690 . but changing the sign of @xmath690 reverses the sign of the element of the clifford algebra that represents an orientation - reversing symmetry .",
    "( for instance , in the example considered earlier , reversing the sign of @xmath690 changes the sign of @xmath694 . )",
    "this has the effect of replacing @xmath673 by @xmath720 and more generally for any real line bundle @xmath188 of replacing @xmath721 by @xmath722 .",
    "the upshot then is that one particular @xmath23 bundle @xmath100 of @xmath659 is equivalent to @xmath723 and a general @xmath23 bundle @xmath724 of @xmath659 , obtained by twisting @xmath100 by a real line bundle @xmath188 , is @xmath725 .",
    "now we can calculate the eta - invariant and verify the identity ( [ pelf ] ) .",

    "moreover , @xmath726 anticommutes with the operator @xmath60 that measures the degree of a differential form mod 2 .",
    "accordingly , the spectrum of the operator @xmath726 is invariant under @xmath124 .",
    "this implies that nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath78 make no net contribution to the eta - invariant .",
    "this invariant is therefore simply the number of zero - modes of @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath727 , @xmath728 be the @xmath729 betti number of @xmath22 ( the number of @xmath324-form zero - modes of @xmath730 acting on @xmath673 ) .",
    "the total number of zero - modes of @xmath726 is @xmath731 , and this is the eta - invariant of @xmath78 acting on @xmath673 .",

    "however , because @xmath732 is odd under reversal of orientation , on an unorientable manifold , it maps @xmath733 to @xmath736 , showing that the number of @xmath324-form zero - modes of @xmath726 acting on @xmath673 is the number of @xmath737-form zero modes of @xmath726 acting on @xmath712 , and vice - versa . ]",

    "the euler characteristic of @xmath22 is @xmath742 , and on the other hand the mod 2 reduction of @xmath741 is the stieffel - whitney class @xmath573 .",

    ", we will now show the following : for a given @xmath22 , the identity ( [ zetat ] ) holds for one choice of @xmath630 if and only if it holds for any @xmath630 . in proving this",
    ", we will use the fact that the left and right hand sides of eqn .",
    "( [ zetat ] ) are both cobordism invariant .",
    "cobordism invariance means that they equal 1 if @xmath22 is the boundary of a five - manifold @xmath402 that is endowed with appropriate structure . concerning the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ zetat ] ) , no additional structure is needed ; the cobordism invariance of @xmath752 is a special case of cobordism invariance of stieffel - whitney numbers ( integrals of products of stieffel - whitney classes ) . on the left hand side ,",
    "we are given @xmath22 and @xmath630 and a @xmath23 structure of @xmath659 .",
    "we have to require that the rank 7 real vector bundle @xmath630 over @xmath22 extends to a rank 7 real vector bundle @xmath753 over @xmath402 , such that there is a @xmath23 structure of @xmath754 that restricts on the boundary to the given @xmath23 structure of @xmath659 .",
    "( these conditions are straightforwardly satisfied in the example considered in the next paragraph . ) under these circumstances , we can define a dirac operator @xmath755 on @xmath402 that is related to the dirac operator @xmath78 of @xmath22 in a way that will let us invoke the atiyah - patodi - singer index theorem @xcite .",
    "let @xmath20 be the eta - invariant of the dirac operator on @xmath22 and @xmath129 the index manifold of odd dimension , the dirac operator maps sections of one @xmath23 bundle to sections of the complementary @xmath23 bundle .",
    "thus it is not self - adjoint ( that is why the anomaly studied in the three - dimensional case in section [ analysis ] is possible ) and in particular can have a nonzero index .",
    "this index vanishes on a compact manifold without boundary ( this statement is a special case of the ordinary atiyah - singer index theorem ) , but on a manifold with boundary , with aps boundary conditions , the index can be nonzero .",
    "for example , see appendices b.4 and c of @xcite .",
    "] of @xmath755 .",
    "the aps index theorem says that @xmath756 , but on the other hand @xmath129 is even because of a version of kramers doubling .",
    "so @xmath20 is a multiple of 4 and @xmath757 , establishing the cobordism invariance of the left hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ zetat ] ) .",
    "now we will use cobordism invariance to show that for a given @xmath22 , the identity ( [ zetat ] ) is true for all @xmath630 if it is true for one @xmath630 . given a triangulation of @xmath630 ,",
    "the constraints @xmath653 , @xmath758 determine @xmath630 on the two - skeleton of @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath759 , there is no further choice to be made on the three - skeleton of @xmath22 .",
    "so any possible @xmath630 differs from the particular choice in eqn .",

    "( an instanton that is transported around an orientation - reversing loop in @xmath22 comes back as an anti - instanton . )",
    "so for unorientable @xmath22 , there are actually only two possible choices of @xmath630 up to isomorphism  the one in ( [ dolfo ] ) , and one with a different value of @xmath573 , reached by gluing in a single instanton .",
    "the proof given in the text does not require a knowledge of this fact .",
    "] these are ordinary gauge theory instantons , classified by @xmath761 , where @xmath550 is the structure group of @xmath630 . to use these facts , start with a copy of @xmath22 , endowed with some normal bundle @xmath630 for which we know that the identity ( [ zetat ] ) holds , and a copy of @xmath762 , endowed with a normal bundle of some instanton number @xmath64 . since @xmath762 is orientable , the identity ( [ zetat ] ) holds for @xmath762 with any normal bundle by virtue of the computation in @xcite ( the basic idea",
    "was explained in section [ zerob ] ) .",
    "now we form the connected sum of @xmath22 and @xmath762 , by cutting a small open ball out of each and gluing them together along the resulting boundaries . to @xmath22 in @xmath97 and the analogous normal bundle to @xmath762 are trivialized along these small balls before the cutting and gluing is done . ]",
    "the connected sum is a manifold @xmath88 that is topologically equivalent to @xmath22 , but with a local modification of @xmath630 that shifts the instanton number by @xmath64 .",
    "the identity we want is true for @xmath22 and for @xmath762 and therefore for their disjoint union , and @xmath88 is cobordant to the disjoint union of @xmath22 and @xmath762 ( fig .",
    "[ cob ] ) .",
    "so the identity is true for @xmath88 .",
    "notice that this argument works for any choice of the @xmath23 structure of @xmath659 .",
    "it is possible to make a similar argument using the gluing theorem for the eta - invariant , rather than its cobordism invariance .     and a four - sphere @xmath762 is cobordant to their connected sum @xmath88 .",
    "the connected sum is defined by cutting an open ball out of each and gluing them together along their boundaries .",

    "in section [ analysis ] of this paper , we extended the standard analysis of the `` parity '' anomaly for fermions in a spacetime of odd dimension to the case of a possibly unorientable manifold .",

    "in the important case of @xmath0 dimensions , we made this formula more concrete for gauge theories with gauge group @xmath43 , @xmath2 , or @xmath26 , and described methods by which this could be done for any gauge group .",
    "a key result of section [ analysis ] was to show that the usual `` parity '' anomaly on an orientable manifold is not the whole story , and that a theory which is anomaly - free if considered on an orientable manifold only may be anomalous if formulated on an unorientable manifold .",
    "the rest of the paper was devoted to two applications .",

    "gapped boundary states of topological insulators and superconductors can be constructed by postulating suitable emergent gauge fields , matter fields , and symmetry breaking patterns on the surface of a material .",
    "this approach was developed in @xcite , mainly but not entirely in the context of a topological insulator . to fully exploit this approach in the case of a topological superconductor",
    "requires a more complete understanding of the `` parity '' anomaly than was available previously . in section [ gb ]",
    ", we use the results of section [ analysis ] to analyze more fully and precisely the gapped boundary states of a topological superconductor that can be constructed using these methods .",
    "a typical application is to show that the boundary of a topological superconductor with @xmath1 , but not one with @xmath25 , can be gapped in a topologically trivial way ( that is , without introducing topological order on the boundary ) .",
    "the existing literature on gapped boundary states of topological insulators and superconductors is extensive and varied ; see for example @xcite .",
    "one difference between the present paper ( and the previous one @xcite ) and some other approaches is that our treatment is completely explicit , based on weak coupling , with no reliance on non - explicit dynamics . and [ confinement ] ,",
    "we describe three ways to gap the boundary of a @xmath1 topological superconductor in a without introducing topological order .",
    "one of the three approaches relies on standard but non - explicit dynamics , namely confinement in @xmath26 gauge theory without matter fields in @xmath0 dimensions . ]",
    "the explicit nature of the dynamics has made it possible to see in @xcite and in the present paper an important feature of these boundary states .",
    "this is a group extension : the bulk relation @xmath763 is generalized along the boundary to @xmath764 , where @xmath245 generates a discrete group of unbroken gauge symmetries .",
    "it is not clear to the author to what extent this has been understood in the previous literature . in section [ bosonic ] , we show that an analogous group extension gives a unified way to construct gapped boundary states of bosonic spt states .",
