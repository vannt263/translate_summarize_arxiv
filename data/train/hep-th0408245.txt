    "over the last years , the study of nonperturbative phenomena in string theory has enjoyed a lively interest .",
    "research in this direction revealed that string field theory is the language in which , e.g. , the decay of unstable d - brane systems can be described most naturally ( for a review of the subject , see  @xcite ) . here , the endpoint of the decay process corresponds to a solution of the equation of motion of the string field theory on the unstable brane . up to now",
    ", however , no satisfactory solutions to this equation have been found even in the simplest setting , i.e. , witten s formulation of bosonic string field theory  @xcite  mainly , due to the following two difficulties :    in this theory , the brst operator  @xmath4 plays the role of the kinetic operator ; it involves matter as well as ghost fields which renders it impossible to study the equation of motion in each sector separately . as a loophole , rastelli , sen , and",
    "zwiebach proposed to consider string field theory around the tachyon vacuum and to describe d - branes from this point of view  @xcite .",
    "it could be shown that , after a singular reparametrization of the worldsheet , the kinetic operator consists solely out of ghosts  @xcite .",
    "thus , the equation of motion factorizes into a matter and a ghost part , the matter part being simply the condition that the matter string field is a projector of the string field algebra . amongst other things ,",
    "this discovery triggered an investigation of structural aspects of the string field algebra .",
    "the second difficulty arises from the star product which is used to multiply string fields  @xcite .",
    "calculations in the customary discrete oscillator basis  @xcite are notoriously difficult ; however , they may be facilitated by the fact that it is possible to choose a basis in the string field theory fock space in which the neumann matrices of the interaction vertex are diagonal  @xcite .",
    "in particular the analysis of algebraic properties of the string field algebra is simplified in this continuous moyal basis .",
    "e.g. , it is possible to classify all twist - even projectors in certain conformal field theories which are diagonal in this basis  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this classification includes many states without immediate geometrical interpretation .",
    "furthermore , due to its similarity with the moyal - weyl product , the algebraic approach to the star algebra could be useful for transferring solution - generating techniques from field theory to string field theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the star product can be computed via conformal field theory methods  @xcite .",
    "they lead to a more geometric understanding of states and their multiplication in string field theory ; in particular , surface states play an important role in the structural analysis of the star algebra .",
    "these are states with field configurations arising from path integrations over fixed riemann surfaces whose boundary consists of a parametrized open string and a piece with open string boundary conditions .",
    "a very fundamental result in this realm  @xcite was that all such surfaces with the property that their boundaries touch the midpoint of the open string lead to projector functionals in the star algebra .",
    "although this class of projectors is quite large , it may be rewarding to look for projectors without this singular property which could eventually lead to d - brane solutions with finite energy densities .",
    "both methods obviously have their own advantages , and it usually depends on the respective case which one is given preference .",
    "however , it seems that it should be possible to make rather strong statements concerning states which can be analyzed particularly well with both methods , i.e. , those which are diagonal in the moyal basis and simultaneously ( twist - even ) surface states .",
    "the analysis of these states is the aim of the present note .",
    "it turns out that a complete classification of such states is possible ; they comprise the butterfly family and a generalization of the wedge states ( with arbitrary angles ) . upholding the belief that possible solutions to the equation of motion of string field theory should have a geometrical interpretation as surface states , the additional demand that the states be simultaneously diagonal in the @xmath1-basis ( and in this sense particularly easy to handle algebraically ) apparently is very strict . in principle",
    ", one could have imagined that this class included hitherto unknown states which could have served as candidate solutions to the equation of motion .",
    "our result seems to imply that we have to look elsewhere for solutions describing the tachyon vacuum .",
    "apart from that , we find that surface state projectors which do not satisfy the sufficient condition that their boundary touches the midpoint of the open string , are particularly rare  at least in the subsector under consideration , we only encounter the identity state .",
    "this result is obtained in three steps : first , we derive a consistency condition on @xmath1-diagonal surface states along the lines of earlier work  @xcite .",
    "this is done in terms of a fermionic first order system with weights  0 and  1 ( but is in principle possible in any other conformal field theory ) and is the subject of section  [ sec : cond ] , where we also present the moyal basis for this system . from the technical point of view",
    ", the consistency condition is a differential equation with deviating arguments on the map @xmath5 which defines a possible surface state .",
    "second , we solve this differential equation ; the solution turns out to be a jacobi sine function parametrized by two complex parameters .",
    "this is the task of section  [ sec : solvcc ] .",
    "third , we examine further constraints on these two parameters in section  [ sec : kdiagss ] since not all solutions to the consistency condition are eligible as surface states .",
    "this leads to the above - described result .",
    "the necessary background on jacobian elliptic functions for this analysis is presented in appendix  [ sec : jac ] . finally , we offer some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the derivation of a consistency condition on twist - even surface states which are diagonal in the @xmath1-basis .",
    "most of the material presented here is a summary of the relevant facts in  @xcite which are included in this note in order to make the discussion self - contained .",
    "the derivation starts from an oscillator representation of the surface state and leads to a requirement on the maps @xmath5 defining the surface state ; for consistency with the treatment in  @xcite , the argument will be presented for a fermionic first order system with weights @xmath6 , i.e. , a twisted @xmath7 system .",
    "naturally , the same condition on @xmath5 can be derived for any given conformal field theory .    * continuous basis in the fermionic first order system . *",
    "the fermionic first order system consists of grassmann - odd fields @xmath8 with weight  0 and @xmath9 with weight  1 . and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these fields occur as twisted worldsheet fermions in string field theory for n=2 strings .",
    "their conformal field theory coincides with the one common from the construction of solutions to the ghost part of the equations of motion in vacuum string field theory  @xcite ; in this context , the fields are customarily denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 . ",

    "one can show that @xmath34 which can be split into even and odd parts to give @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",

    "* case 4 : @xmath158 , @xmath172 imaginary .",
    "* with the same notation as above , we may read off from eq .  ( [ eq : kidecomp ] ) that the imaginary part of @xmath118 is positive exactly where @xmath224 due to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sn2cn2])([eq : cn2dn2 ] ) , the expression in brackets equals @xmath225 .",
    "thus , @xmath118 maps the region where @xmath226 to the upper half plane .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ki](b ) ; obviously , there are no values of  @xmath227 such that @xmath5 maps the unit upper half disk completely into the upper half plane again .    * case 5 : @xmath228 , @xmath229 . * the last case is the situation where  @xmath158 takes values in the unit circle .",
    "the analysis in this case is a slightly more involved than before .",
    "we restrict the discussion to the case @xmath230 ; the other case with @xmath231 can be treated analogously .",
    "we already saw in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : solreal ] ) and  ( [ eq : solreal2 ] ) that with  @xmath229 , @xmath232 for @xmath233 ; similarly , it is trivial to see that @xmath234 for @xmath235 .",
    "since furthermore , for @xmath204 , @xmath236 , eq .  ( [ eq : snadd ] ) yields the following imaginary part : @xmath237 where the elliptic modulus is always  @xmath238 . because of  ( [ eq : snxre ] ) and  ( [ eq : sniyim ] ) , the denominator is positive ; thus , the imaginary part is positive exactly where @xmath239 is . a careful analysis using the zeroes and singularities given in appendix  [ sec : jac ] and the conjugation properties  ( [ eq : kpconj ] ) and  ( [ eq : kconj ] ) shows that the singularities of the jacobi sine function bound the real values of  @xmath240 for which the imaginary part of  @xmath241 is positive .",
    "the intervals for which this is so are ( for @xmath242 ) : @xmath243 as above , the elliptic modulus is always  @xmath238 .",
    "since condition  ( iii ) requires the upper bound of these intervals to be infinite this case only leads ( asymptotically ) to the solution @xmath244 ( i.e. , the sliver , which was already discussed in case  1 ) .",
    "this concludes the proof that there are no twist - even @xmath1-diagonal surface states apart from the butterfly family  ( [ eq : butfam ] ) and a trivial extension of the wedge states admitting arbitrary angles , cf .",
    "( [ eq : wdgfam ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have derived and analyzed a consistency condition on twist - even @xmath1-diagonal surface states .",
    "the general solution was found to be a two - parameter family of ( candidate ) maps defining a surface state , @xmath245 .",
    "this family contains the well - known butterfly family as well as an extension of the family of wedge states to arbitrary angles ; and the conditions that the meromorphic function @xmath5 map the real line to itself and the unit upper half disk one - to - one to some region of the upper half plane were enough to show that these are in fact the only admissible maps to define a surface state .",
    "in particular , this result demonstrates that surface state projectors which do not satisfy the sufficient condition that their boundary touches the midpoint of the open string ( i.e. , @xmath246 in upper half plane coordinates ) are particularly rare  at least in the subsector of twist - even @xmath1-diagonal surface state projectors , we only found the identity state .",
    "all other projectors share this singular property .",
    "furthermore , this result completes the classification of @xmath1-diagonal projectors ( in a fermionic first order system ) commenced in  @xcite .",
    "besides , it also proves the conjecture made in  @xcite that the projectors @xmath247 defined by @xmath248 for @xmath249 are not contained in the @xmath250 subalgebra .",
    "hitherto , this conjecture had only been checked numerically .",
    "it is conceivable that the strategy pursued here can be extended to the general case without the restriction to the twist - even subsector .",
    "the hope that underlies this approach is that a better knowledge of the algebraic structures of the star algebra will help to pave the way to solving the equation of motion of string field theory .",
    "i would like to thank alexander kling , yuji okawa , martin schnabl , wati taylor , david tong , and barton zwiebach for discussions .",
    "furthermore , i would like to thank matthias ihl for encouragement as well as a collaboration at an intermediate stage .",
    "this work was supported by a fellowship within the postdoc program of the german academic exchange service ( daad ) .",
    "in this appendix , we present the definitions and properties of the jacobian elliptic functions used throughout the text .",
    "a good reference for some of the formulas is  @xcite .",
    "* definitions . *",
    "the jacobian elliptic functions ( of which we need here only @xmath178 , @xmath251 , and @xmath252 ) are doubly - periodic functions defined as the ( analytic continuation of the ) inverse of elliptic integrals , @xmath253 here , @xmath158 denotes the modulus , @xmath185 is the complementary modulus .",
    "note that a number of incompatible conventions for the modulus are in common use , e.g. , @xmath158 is often replaced by its square . if the modulus is obvious , it is mostly omitted ( as above ) ; otherwise , we denote it explicitly by @xmath254 etc . for @xmath189 , @xmath178 and @xmath251",
    "reduce to the ordinary trigonometric functions , @xmath255 and @xmath256 ( and @xmath257 ) . for @xmath204 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "* complete elliptic integrals . *",
    "the periodicity and zeroes of the jacobian elliptic functions can be expressed in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , @xmath260 where the modulus  @xmath158 is often omitted .",
    "this is the value  @xmath261 where the jacobi sine function equals  1 .",
    "it is customary to set @xmath262 in general , we have @xmath263 where the bar denotes complex conjugation .",
    "this ensures that the period parallelogram of the jacobian elliptic functions specified in the next paragraph is a rectangle .",
    "the elliptic integral of the first kind has a branch cut from  1 to  @xmath264 .",
    "particular values are @xmath265 and @xmath266 . for the analysis in section  [ sec : kdiagss ]",
    ", we derive some further properties for @xmath267 : setting @xmath268 and being careful with the branchcuts , we can check that @xmath269 and @xmath270 therefore , we obtain the conjugation properties @xmath271 and @xmath272    * symmetries , periodicities , zeroes , and poles . *",
    "the jacobi sine function is an odd function of its first argument , the jacobi cosine function as well as the delta function are even w.r.t .  to  @xmath261 .",
    "all three functions are even in  @xmath158 . for @xmath273 ,",
    "the power series expansion takes the form : @xmath274 a closed form for the taylor coefficients is unknown .",
    "the jacobian elliptic functions are not periodic in  @xmath158 ; the periods , zeroes , and poles in  @xmath261 are located at :       here , it is understood that @xmath275 .",
    "one can read off from @xmath276 and @xmath277 , @xmath278 that the jacobi sine function changes sign only along the real axis whereas the jacobi cosine function does so along both axes .",
