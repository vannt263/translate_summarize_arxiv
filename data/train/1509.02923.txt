    "boson stars ( bss )  see  @xcite for reviews  were originally discovered in einstein s gravity minimally coupled to a massive ( mass @xmath0 ) , free , complex scalar field  @xcite .",
    "they are often described as macroscopic quantum states , or bose - einstein condensates , which are prevented from collapsing by heisenberg s uncertainty principle . but a purely macroscopic interpretation can be obtained by regarding the scalar field as a perfect fluid , which , generically , has pressure ( see @xmath8  @xcite ) .",
    "naturally , the pressure can only prevent collapse into a black hole ( bh ) up to some maximal mass , as it is also the case for fermionic compact stars , where one obtains the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff limit . from generic arguments ,",
    "the maximum adm mass of bss supported by a free complex scalar field is of the order of the compton wavelength of the scalar field : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the planck and sun masses , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath11 must be obtained from computing the explicit solutions ( numerically , as there are no closed form known solutions in four spacetime dimensions ) , and is of order unity .",
    "its specific value depends on the ` quantum ' numbers of the bs .",
    "bss can have a number of nodes @xmath12 in the scalar field profile and an azimuthal harmonic dependence @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , if they are rotating .",
    "for instance , for nodeless bss  usually regarded as the fundamental and more stable states  with azimuthal harmonic index @xmath15 ( spherically symmetric ) , @xmath16  @xcite , whereas for rotating solutions with @xmath17 , @xmath18  @xcite . as a rule of thumb",
    ", one may expect @xmath19 to increase with @xmath20 as @xmath21 . in any case , unless one considers absurdly high values of @xmath20 , for typical standard model particle masses , say @xmath22 gev , this maximal mass is small , by astrophysical standards : @xmath23 .",
    "for this reason such bss have been dubbed _ _ mini-__bss .",
    "it was , however , shown by colpi , shapiro and wasserman  @xcite , that @xmath19 can be considerably increased if quartic - self - interactions are introduced as a potential term : @xmath24 , where @xmath5 is a coupling constant .",
    "then , for spherically symmetric _",
    "quartic_-bss  @xcite @xmath25 thus , if , say , @xmath22 gev and @xmath26 , this maximal mass is comparable to that of astrophysical objects : @xmath27 and it grows without bound as @xmath5 increases . in fact , as observed in  @xcite , @xmath19 becomes comparable to the chandrasekhar mass for fermions of mass @xmath28 .",
    "relation ( [ csw ] ) was established by putting together numerical data and an analysis of the large @xmath29 limit , where the equations simplify and some analytical relations can be obtained . in particular it was observed that when this quantity is large , the spatial distribution of the quartic - bss becomes more extended than for mini - bss , with a slower fall off of the scalar field close to the centre of the star matching the asymptotic exponential fall off .",
    "thus , quartic - bss become larger than mini - bss and can withstand larger masses without gravitationally collapsing into bhs .    a small number of works generalized quartic - bss to the rotating case .",
    "the pioneering work by ryan  @xcite focused on the aforementioned large self - interaction limit , whereas more recent works  @xcite focused on a single value of the coupling @xmath5 and obtained , for instance , solutions with higher @xmath20 .",
    "a first goal of this work is to present a more systematic study of rotating quartic - bss in terms of @xmath5 . in particular , we obtain the analogue of ( [ csw ] ) for solutions with @xmath30 , which is ( @xmath31 fig .",
    "[ max_mass_0 ] ) : @xmath32    our main interest on this maximal mass has , however , a different focus . in a recent development  @xcite , it was shown that one can add a bh at the centre of asymptotically flat mini - bss , as a stationary solution , as long as the bh and the bs are in a synchronized co - rotation ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "these solutions form a family of _ kerr black holes with scalar hair _ ( kbhssh ) , since they interpolate continuously between mini - bss  in the limit of vanishing horizon  and kerr bhs  in the limit of vanishing scalar field . the necessity for rotation is clearly understood in the kerr limit , wherein the backreacting scalar field  hair \" reduces to test field  clouds \" around kerr bhs , first described by hod for extremal kerr backgrounds  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "these clouds are bound states at the threshold of the superradiant instability of kerr bhs triggered by a massive bosonic field , which only exists for the kerr family if the angular momentum is non - vanishing .",
    "thus , it was suggested in  @xcite that any field triggering a superradiant instability ( see  @xcite for a review ) of a ( bald ) bh background should allow the construction of hairy solutions with that field .",
    "in fact , an extra condition is that the field must give rise to a time - independent energy - momentum tensor from the threshold modes  @xcite .",
    "this explains why a single real scalar field can not originate stationary scalar hair , a fact recently proved with generality  @xcite .",
    "the full domain of existence of kbhssh was exhibited in  @xcite ; in particular it was shown that the adm mass of these bhs is bound by the mass of the corresponding mini - bss that are obtained in the limit of vanishing horizon .",
    "hence , in this model , the maximum adm mass of kbhssh is still given by ( [ mini ] ) , with the value of @xmath11 for the appropriate @xmath33 .",
    "one may ask , instead , what is the maximal _ horizon _ , rather than adm , mass for kbhssh .",
    "the former is well defined in terms of a komar integral . a first analysis of horizon mass and angular momentum for kbhssh",
    "was presented in  @xcite where it was pointed out that the kerr bound can be violated in terms of horizon quantities .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to make a different observation : the maximum horizon mass @xmath34 for kbhssh is attained at a particular configuration we dub the _ hod point _ , corresponding to the extremal ( vacuum ) kerr bh obtained in the vanishing hair limit , and precisely one of the points studied in  @xcite . for kbhssh",
    "this maximal mass obeys the same form as , @xmath35 but with the constant @xmath36 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath17 , @xmath37 .    since the introduction of self - interaction changes the maximal adm mass of bss from into or , a natural question is what happens both to the adm and horizon maximal mass for the case of the hairy bhs in the self - interacting theory . for simplicity we shall henceforth dub these solutions as _ quartic - kbhssh _ , which have been recently considered in  @xcite , in a more general context .",
    "these authors presented the full domain of existence of quartic - kbhssh , for values of @xmath20 up to 8 , albeit for a single value of the coupling @xmath5 .",
    "their domains of existence follow a similar pattern to the ones of kbhssh and in particular their adm mass is bounded by that of the corresponding bss ; this suggests formula   applies also to quartic - kbhssh . as a third goal of this paper",
    ", we generalize this observation for more generic couplings : we shall compute the domain of existence of quartic - kbhssh for various values of the coupling @xmath5 and , in particular , establish that ( [ quartic_rotating ] ) still provides the maximum adm mass of quartic - kbhssh for coupling @xmath5 ( and @xmath30 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "a quite different behaviour is observed for the maximal _ horizon _ mass of quartic - kbhssh .",
    "the fourth goal of this paper is to establish that , regardless of the coupling in the self - interacting case , the maximal horizon mass is still attained at the hod point .",
    "thus , relation ( [ hodpoint ] ) provides the maximal horizon mass of quartic - kbhssh for coupling @xmath5 .",
    "consequenty , as @xmath5 increases , the spacetime of quartic - kbhssh can become considerably hairier , in the sense that the ratio between @xmath39 can increase dramatically ; but the bh itself , @xmath40 the horizon , can not become  heavier \" , @xmath40 more massive .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] we briefly describe the quartic model . in sec .",
    "[ sec_ii ] we present the quartic - bs solutions , emphasizing the variation of the maximal mass with the coupling . in sec .",
    "[ sec_iii ] we describe the quartic - kbhssh in terms of adm quantities , giving the full domain of existence for three different values of the self - coupliing @xmath41 , which we compare with the non - self - interacting case ( @xmath42 ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec_iv ] we explore the horizon quantities for the original and quartic - kbhssh , showing that the maximum horizon mass is reached at the hod point . finally , in sec .  [ sec_v ]",
    "we discuss the universality of our main observation , which we support by examining _",
    "q_-kbhssh ( defined therein ) and discuss some possible research directions related to phenomenology .",

    "the boundary conditions used to solve these equations are different depending on considering bss or kbhssh , but do not depend on @xmath5 , and can also be found in  @xcite , together with a description of the numerical code used to solve the pdes , employing a newton - raphson relaxation method .",
    "we start by considering quartic - bs solutions and their dependence on the coupling @xmath5 .",
    "these solutions are conveniently presented in an adm mass @xmath59 scalar field frequency diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - vs - m - bss ] . in this type of diagram , for @xmath42",

    "a minimum frequency is then reached after which the curve backbends towards a second branch .",
    "a second backbending and a third branch can be seen in fig . 1 of  @xcite .    , nodeless bss , as a function of @xmath54 , for various values of @xmath5 ( defined by @xmath62 , used in numerics ) : ( from bottom to top ) @xmath63 ( red curve ) , @xmath64 , @xmath65 in steps of @xmath66 , and @xmath67 in steps of @xmath68 .",

    "also , the range of frequencies becomes slightly smaller with increasing coupling .",

    "[ fig : w - vs - m - bss ] continues after the local minimum of the mass towards a third branch which has been omitted for simplicity , but can be observed in the plots of the next section . finally , observe that all bs curves merge at the origin , where they trivialize .    from the data exhibited in fig .",

    ".,width=323 ]    to summarize , as the ( quartic-)kbhssh are bounded by the extremal kbhssh line and the vacuum kerr bh line , and since both of these curves have their maxima at the hod point , we conclude that the maximal horizon quantities are obtained at the hod point and all ( quartic-)kbhssh will have horizon quantities that are lower than those at the hod point .",
    "the main , and somehow unexpected , result in this paper is the observation that quartic - self interactions make kbhssh  hairier \" but not ",
    "heavier \" , in the sense of being able to increase their adm mass but not their horizon mass , with respect to the maximal values attained in the absence of self - interactions .",
    "an immediate question is how _ universal _ is this behaviour , if one considers a generic self - interacting scalar field theory .    to test this universality",
    ", we briefly consider a family of potentials allowing for localized solitonic configurations even in the absence of gravity .",
    "this family considers hexic self - interactions and the corresponding scalar solitons  known as _ q - balls _",
    "@xcite , @xmath84 bundles of noether charge associated with the @xmath85 symmetry ( typically denoted by @xmath86 )  have found a wide range of applications and interest in field theory ( see @xmath8  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we replace the potential ( [ pot ] ) by @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 . in the following",
    "we take @xmath90 and @xmath91 and it is convenient to introduce as well the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath92 .    on the one hand , a systematic study of the spinning solitons ( including the effects induced by the backreaction on the spacetime geometry ) is given in @xcite .",
    "the results therein show that the generic gravitating bss in this theory , which we dub _",
    "q_-bss , follow closely the pattern for mini - bss and quartic - bss described herein ; in particular one finds a similar , albeit somewhat distorted , version of the mass @xmath59 frequency diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - vs - m - bss ] .    on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite has studied @xmath86-clouds , @xmath84 ( non - backreacting ) @xmath86-balls on the ( vacuum ) kerr bh background .",
    "we have done some preliminary studies of backreacting @xmath86-balls , and found families of kbhssh with this type of self - interactions , which we dub @xmath86-kbhssh .",
    "the overall properties of these bh solutions are similar to those found herein for quartic - kbhssh . in particular , the domain of existence is still bounded by the ( corresponding ) curves @xmath74 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 as defined in section [ sec_iii ] .",
    "therefore , the maximal adm mass of the solutions is that of the corresponding @xmath86-bss .",
    "we remark that for the same scalar field mass , @xmath86-kbhsssh seem able to become considerably hairier than kbhssh or quartic - kbhssh .",

    "in fact , this feature starts to manifest already for @xmath93 of order 1 .",
    "this provides further evidence for the universality of the  hairier \" but not  heavier \" behaviour .    to close let us make a few remarks about phenomenology . to test the potential astrophysical relevance of khbssh ,",
    "it would be interesting to compute , for both quartic and @xmath86-kbhssh , observables such as the frequency at the isco and the quadrupole moment .",
    "both these properties have been discussed for kbhssh without self - interactions in  @xcite , in terms of adm quantities .",
    "the results in this paper suggest that large difference will occur when considering these properties in terms of adm quantities , for the self - interacting case , whereas these observables should be mostly unchanged when considered in terms of horizon quantities , regardless of the self - interactions .",
    "another class of observables of interest concerns the bh shadows , in view of the ongoing and forthcoming observations of the event horizon telescope .",
    "the shadows of kbhssh ( without self - interactions ) have been recently studied  @xcite and can have strong deviations from the kerr shadows .",
    "the strong deviations from the kerr results are largely due to the lensing of the scalar  hair \" that surrounds the horizon .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to expect that such deviations can be aggravated for quartic or @xmath86-kbhssh which can become even  hairier \" .    finally , since the maximal horizon mass behaves as in , if the  hairier \" but not ",
    "heavier \" property is universal and holds regardless of the scalar field theory , then kbhssh with a trapped region with astrophysical masses can only exist if ultra - light scalars occur in nature .",

    "<S> remarkably , whereas the adm mass scales in the same way as for bss , the _ horizon mass _ @xmath4 does not increases with the coupling @xmath5 , and , for fixed @xmath0 , it is maximized at the  hod point \" , corresponding to the extremal kerr black hole obtained in the vanishing hair limit . </S>",

    "<S> thus , introducing these self - interactions , the black hole spacetimes may become considerably  hairier \" but the trapped regions can not become  heavier \" . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence this observation also holds in a model with @xmath7 ; if it extends to _ general _ scalar field models , kbhssh with astrophysically interesting horizon masses _ require _ ultra - light scalar fields . their existence , therefore , would be a smoking gun for such ( beyond the standard model ) particles . </S>"
