    "an electric current can influence the magnetic state of a ferromagnet by exerting a _ spin transfer torque_(stt ) on the magnetization.@xcite this effect occurs whenever currents travel through non - collinear magnetic systems and is therefore promising for magnetoelectronic applications .",
    "indeed , stt s have already been exploited in a number of technological devices.@xcite partly for this reason and partly because the quantitative description of order parameter manipulation by out - of - equilibrium quasiparticles poses great theoretical challenges , the study of the stt effect has developed into a major research subfield of spintronics .",
    "spin transfer torques are important in both magnetic multilayers , where the magnetization changes abruptly,@xcite and in magnetic nanowires , where the magnetization changes smoothly.@xcite theories of the stt in systems with smooth magnetic textures identify two different types of spin transfer . on one hand , the adiabatic or slonczewski@xcite torque results",
    "when quasiparticle spins follow the underlying magnetic landscape adiabatically .",
    "it can be mathematically expressed as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 stands for the magnetization and @xmath4 is the `` spin velocity '' , which is proportional to the charge drift velocity , and hence to the current and the applied electric field .",
    "the microscopic physics of the slonczewski spin - torque is thought to be well understood@xcite , at least@xcite in systems with weak spin - orbit coupling .",
    "a simple angular momentum conservation argument argues that in the absence of spin - orbit coupling @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the magnetization , @xmath7 is the spin conductivity and @xmath8 is the electric field .",
    "however , spin - orbit coupling plays an essential role in real magnetic materials and hence the validity of this simple expression for @xmath9 needs to be tested by more rigorous calculations .    the second spin transfer torque in continuous media , @xmath10 , acts in the perpendicular direction and is frequently referred to as the non - adiabatic torque.@xcite unfortunately , the name is a misnomer in the present context .",
    "there are two contributions that have the preceeding form .",
    "the first is truly non - adiabatic and occurs in systems in which the magnetization varies too rapidly in space for the spins of the transport electrons to follow the local magnetization direction as they traverse the magnetization texture . for wide domain walls",
    ", these effects are expected to be small.@xcite the contribution of interest in this paper is a dissipative contribution that occurs in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the adiabatic torque discussed above is the reactive contribution in this limit . as we discuss below , processes that contribute to magnetic damping , whether they derive from spin - orbit coupling or spin - dependent scattering , also give a spin - transfer torque parameterized by @xmath0 as above .",
    "in this paper , we follow the common convention and refer to this torque as non - adiabatic .",
    "however , it should be understood that it is a dissipative spin transfer torque that is present in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the non - adiabatic torque plays a key role in current - driven domain wall dynamics , where the ratio between @xmath0 and the gilbert parameter @xmath1 can determine the velocity of domain walls under the influence of a transport current .",
    "there is no consensus on its magnitude of the parameter @xmath0.@xcite although there have a few theoretical studies@xcite of the stt in toy models , the relationship between toy model stt s and stt s in either transition metal ferromagnets or ferromagnetic semiconductors is far from clear .",
    "as we will discuss the toy models most often studied neglect spin - orbit interactions in the band - structure of the perfect crystal , _ intrinsic _ spin - orbit interactions , which can alter stt physics qualitatively .",
    "the main objectives of this paper are ( i ) to shed new light on the physical meaning of the non - adiabatic stt by relating it to the change in magnetization damping due to a transport current , ( ii ) to derive a concise formula that can be used to evaluate @xmath0 in real materials from first principles and ( iii ) to demonstrate that @xmath1 and @xmath0 have the same qualitative dependence on disorder ( or temperature ) , even though their ratio depends on the details of the band structure . as a byproduct of our theoretical study",
    ", we find that the expression for @xmath9 in terms of the spin conductivity may not always be accurate in materials with strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we begin in section ii by reviewing and expanding on microscopic theories of @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath9 . in short ,",
    "our microscopic approach quantifies how the micromagnetic energy of an inhomogeneous ferromagnet is altered in response to external rf fields and dc transport currents which drive the magnetization direction away from local equilibrium .",
    "these effects are captured by the spin transfer torques , damping torques , and effective magnetic fields that appear in the lls equation . by relating magnetization dynamics to effective magnetic fields",
    ", we derive explicit expressions for @xmath1,@xmath0 and @xmath9 in terms of microscopic parameters .",
    "important contributions to these materials parameters can be understood in clear physical terms using the breathing fermi surface model.@xcite readers mainly interested in a qualitative explanation for our findings may skip directly to section viii where we discuss of our main results in that framework .",
    "regardless of the approach , the non - adiabatic stt can be understood as the change in the gilbert damping contribution to magnetization dynamics when the fermi sea quasiparticle distribution function is altered by the transport electric field .",
    "the outcome of this insight is a concise analytical formula for @xmath0 which is simple enough that it can be conveniently combined with first - principles electronic structure calculations to predict @xmath0-values in particular materials.@xcite    in sections iii , iv and v we apply our expression for @xmath0 to model ferromagnets . in section iii",
    "we perform a necessary reality check by applying our theory of @xmath0 to the parabolic band stoner ferromagnet , the only model for which more rigorous fully microscopic calculations@xcite of @xmath0 have been completed .",
    "section iv is devoted to the study of a two - dimensional electron - gas ferromagnet with rashba spin - orbit interactions .",
    "studies of this model provide a qualitative indication of the influence of intrinsic spin - orbit interactions on the non - adiabatic stt .",
    "we find that , as in the microscopic theory@xcite for @xmath1 , spin - orbit interactions induce intra - band contributions to @xmath0 which are proportional to the quasiparticle lifetimes .",
    "these considerations carry over to the more sophisticated 4-band spherical model that we analyze in section v ; there our calculation is tailored to ( ga , mn)as . we show that intra - band ( conductivity - like ) contributions are prominent in the 4-band model for experimentally relevant scattering rates .",
    "section vi discusses the phenomenologically important @xmath11 ratio for real materials . using our analytical results derived in section ii ( or section viii )",
    "we are able to reproduce and extrapolate trends expected from toy models which indicate that @xmath11 should vary across materials in approximately the same way as the ratio between the itinerant spin density and the total spin density .",
    "we also suggest that @xmath1 and @xmath0 may have the opposite signs in systems with both hole - like and electron - like carriers .",
    "we present concrete results for ( ga , mn)as , where we obtain @xmath12 . this is reasonable in view of the weak spin polarization and the strong spin - orbit coupling of valence band holes in this material .",
    "section vii describes the generalization of the _ torque - correlation _ formula employed in _ ab - initio _ calculations of the gilbert damping to the case of the non - adiabatic spin - transfer torque .",
    "the torque correlation formula incorporates scattering of quasiparticles simply by introducing a phenomenological lifetime for the bloch states and assumes that the most important electronic transitions occur between states near the fermi surface in the same band . our ability to make quantitative predictions based on this formula",
    "is limited mainly by an incomplete understanding of bloch state scattering processes in real ferromagnetic materials .",
    "these simplifications give rise to ambiguities and inaccuracies that we dissect in section vii .",
    "our assessment indicates that the torque correlation formula for @xmath0 is most accurate at low disorder and relatively weak spin - orbit interactions .",
    "section viii restates and complements the effective field calculation explained in section ii . within the adiabatic approximation",
    ", the instantaneous energy of a ferromagnet may be written in terms of the instantaneous occupation factors of quasiparticle states .",
    "we determine the effect of the external perturbations on the occupation factors by combining the relaxation time approximation and the master equation . in this way",
    "we recover the results of section ii and are able to interpret the intra - band contributions to @xmath0 in terms of a generalized breathing fermi surface picture .",
    "section ix contains a brief summary which concludes this work .",
    "the gilbert damping parameter @xmath1 , the non - adiabatic spin transfer torque coefficient @xmath0 and the `` spin velocity '' @xmath13 appear in the generalized landau - lifshitz - gilbert expression for collective magnetization dynamics of a ferromagnet under the influence of an electric current : @xmath14 in eq .",
