    "if @xmath25 is invariant under the rotation of the graph that represents @xmath14 by 2@xmath42 , then @xmath62 is called a @xmath0-periodic coloring .",
    "let us start with any coloring of @xmath14 say @xmath62 , either @xmath62 is @xmath0-periodic or not .",
    "let us assume that @xmath62 is not @xmath0-periodic , i.e @xmath25 is not invariant under the rotation by 2@xmath42 about the @xmath40-axis .",
    "hence the @xmath26-th rotation of @xmath25 ( the rotation by @xmath64 ) represents a ribbon graph with the same value under @xmath6 ( since @xmath6 is an isotopy invariant ) and different coloring denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "so the term with a non - periodic coloring occurs @xmath0 times .",
    "hence we reduce the summation on the left - hand side to the periodic colorings .",
    "now the result follows from corollary ( [ c : trace ] ) and the fact that the periodic colorings of @xmath14 are in one - to - one correspondence with the colorings of @xmath47(by restriction ) .",

    "let @xmath78 denote the self - intersection of @xmath77 in @xmath79 using the framing on @xmath9 obtained from any seifert surface for @xmath9 in @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", we define the total signature @xmath80 @xmath81 by a well - known argument , using novikov additivity and the @xmath2-signature theory @xcite , @xmath80 is independent of the choices made .",
    "the linking matrix of @xmath14 describes the intersection form on 4-manifold with boundary @xmath13 which is a branched cover along a disk with zero self - intersection in a 4-manifold with boundary @xmath45 .",
