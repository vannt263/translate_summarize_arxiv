    "asymptotically complex hyperbolic metrics , or ach metrics for short , that we study here were introduced by epstein , melrose and mendoza in a study @xcite of the resolvent of the laplacian of complete khler metrics of the form @xmath0 on a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain , where @xmath1 is a boundary defining function . the purpose of this paper is to discuss the formal asymptotic expansion of ach - einstein metrics at the boundary and geometry of their `` cr infinities . ''",

    "einstein metrics reduces , lee and melrose @xcite proved that its solution admits an asymptotic expansion at @xmath3 including logarithmic terms .",
    "graham @xcite showed that this expansion is determined by the local cr geometry of @xmath3 up to the ambiguity of one real scalar - valued function on @xmath3 , and identified the coefficient of the first logarithmic term as the only obstruction to the existence of a log - free solution .",
    "as for ach metrics , a perturbation result on the existence and the boundary regularity of solutions of the einstein equation is obtained by biquard @xcite , and the existence of asymptotic expansions is studied by biquard and herzlich @xcite .",

    "our analysis of ach - einstein metrics is sufficient for doing the same construction for cr geometries as the scattering - theoretic definition @xcite of the @xmath19-curvature ; one has only to apply the discussion of guillarmou and s barreto @xcite to our metric .",
    "this is already done for integrable cr manifolds by hislop , perry and tang @xcite using the asymptotics of complete khler  einstein metrics obtained in @xcite , but the ach approach has an advantage that it can extend the notion of cr @xmath19-curvature naturally to the case of partially integrable almost cr manifolds . on this line , just like in the conformal case @xcite , one can show that the cr obstruction tensor @xmath20 is equal to the variation of the total cr @xmath19-curvature with respect to modifications of partially integrable almost cr structures preserving the contact distribution .",

    "let @xmath4 be a singular normal - form ach metric we have obtained in lemma [ lem : firsthalfofsolvingatcriticalstep ] . by , and we have @xmath747 if we set @xmath748 and @xmath749 , then attaining @xmath750 and @xmath751 is equivalent to solving the following system of pdes : @xmath752 if we substitute the second equation into the first one and use @xmath682 and , the system is reduced to @xmath753 .",

    "again this theorem also holds in the formal sense .",
