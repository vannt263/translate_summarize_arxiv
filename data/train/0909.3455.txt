    "long wavelength excitations of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with repulsive interactions exhibit a phononlike , linear dispersion , causing these excitations to move at a finite speed @xmath0 , the speed of sound .",
    "excitations with a wavelength comparable to the size of the cloud result in collective shape oscillations of the system @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation is linear up to wave vectors of the order of the inverse of the healing length .",
    "perturbations with a wavelength much shorter than the axial size of the cloud and larger than the healing length therefore give rise to the excitation of a hydrodynamic mode propagating at the speed of sound .    in the case of liquid helium sound excitations",
    "have been extensively studied below the @xmath1-point , where a superfluid and a normal fluid coexist . in this regime",
    "two sound modes can be distinguished : the first mode , first sound , consists of an in - phase oscillation of the superfluid and normal fluid component , while the second mode , second sound , consists of an out - of - phase oscillation of the superfluid and normal fluid component .",
    "the occurrence of two distinct modes is caused by the presence of both a superfluid density and normal fluid density , which are coupled .",
    "one of the drawbacks of liquid helium is that the interactions are so strong that a clear distinction between the two components is difficult which complicates the interpretation of the phenomena .    in the dilute gaseous bec",
    "studied here a two - fluid system exists below @xmath2 , analogous to the case of liquid helium . in our setup the thermal cloud is in the hydrodynamic regime , where collisions between atoms are rapid enough to establish a state of dynamic local equilibrium in the non - condensed atoms .",
    "in contrast to bose - condensed liquid helium , the superfluid in the gaseous bec corresponds directly to the bose - condensed atoms and the normal component directly to the thermal , non - condensed atoms , since the interactions are much weaker .",
    "first and second sound in a bose gas exhibit different features than those in a bose liquid @xcite . in liquid helium ,",
    "the coupling between the density and temperature is weak , since @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the specific heat for constant pressure and constant volume , respectively . as a result ,",
    "in liquid helium first sound is mainly a density wave , while second sound is an almost pure temperature wave .",
    "in contrast , in a bose gas , the density and temperature fluctuations are strongly coupled , since @xmath5 . the first sound mode in a bose gas",
    "is largely an oscillation of the density of the thermal cloud ( the normal fluid ) and second sound is largely an oscillation of the density of the condensate ( the superfluid ) @xcite . in superfluid helium ,",
    "only the first sound mode can be excited by a density perturbation .",
    "in contrast , second sound has a significant weight in the density response function in superfluid bose gases at finite temperatures and can be excited by a local perturbation of the density .",
    "since we can directly image becs and make a clear distinction between both components , it allows for a direct comparison with theoretical descriptions of the two - fluid system modeling the interactions between both components .",
    "thus the research using weakly interacting bose gases promises results that will go beyond the results obtained using liquid helium .    in a pioneering paper by lee and",
    "yang the speed of first and second sound is derived for a dilute bose gas , although there is no coupling between both sound modes @xcite .",
    "this interaction is taken into account in the two - fluid model developed by landau for liquid helium @xcite and in a hydrodynamic model developed by zaremba , griffin , and nikuni for trapped bose gases @xcite . in these papers",
    "it is shown that the hydrodynamic second sound mode at finite temperature extrapolates to the @xmath6 bogoliubov phonon mode .",
    "the propagation of sound in a harmonically trapped , almost pure bec in the collisionless regime has been observed experimentally in a pioneering experiment by the mit group @xcite and studied theoretically by various authors @xcite .",
    "after the first experiment , sound propagation has been observed for a bec in an optical lattice , the excitation spectrum of a bec has been measured and the excitation of shock waves is observed @xcite .",
    "the work presented here describes the experimental observation of a propagating sound wave in an elongated bec at finite temperatures and extends the study by the mit group in two ways .",
    "first , in the work presented here the propagation of a sound wave is observed at finite temperatures .",
    "the thermal cloud is in the hydrodynamic regime above @xmath2 and the cloud is therefore a two - fluid system below @xmath2 : a superfluid bec coexists with a normal fluid of thermal atoms . if the thermal cloud is already close to the hydrodynamic regime above @xmath2 , it will be deeply in the hydrodynamic regime when the bec forms , since the collision rate @xmath7 is dominated by the collisions between the condensed and the thermal atoms determined by the rate @xmath8 @xcite . in the two - fluid system interactions between the superfluid and the normal component are expected to play an important role .",
    "second , the high signal - to - noise ratio of our imaging technique allows us to make smaller excitations than is used in the mit experiments , thereby limiting non - linear effects .",
    "the large atom number becs in combination with the weak axial confinement results in typical axial bec lengths of more than 2 mm .",
    "this allows for the determination of the speed of sound with a high accuracy , since the propagation distance can be large before the sound wave reaches the edge of the bec .",
    "since second sound at finite temperatures extrapolates to the @xmath6 bogoliubov phonon mode , we start this discussion in the @xmath6 limit .",
    "the speed of second sound in the absence of a thermal cloud can be derived using the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "reformulated as a pair of hydrodynamic equations , neglecting the quantum pressure and after linearization , the gpe can be written in the simplified , hydrodynamic form @xcite @xmath9 where the departure of the density from its equilibrium density @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 and the local speed of sound @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the chemical potential , @xmath15 is the external confinement and @xmath16 is the mass . in a uniform bose gas , @xmath17 ,",

    "@xmath20 only depends on temperature through the bec density and is independent of the thermal density .",
    "the experiments are conducted in an elongated 3d trap where the external confinement in the radial ( subscript rad ) and axial ( subscript ax ) direction is given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and the density depends on the position .",
    "although the confinement is highly anisotropic , the bec is not fully in the 1d regime , since @xmath23 . for the radial average density we use the thomas - fermi ( tf ) value @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the central axial density .",
    "the local bogoliubov speed of sound is given in terms of the radial average density by @xmath26 a result confirmed using different methods @xcite . in our experiment",

    "two theoretical descriptions are available in which the effect of the interaction between the normal and the superfluid component on the speed of sound is taken into account .",

    "briefly , the atoms are imaged _ in situ _ and in contrast to other implementations of the phase - contrast imaging technique @xcite , our implementation does not aim at non - destructive imaging , but uses the periodicity of the intensity of the phase contrast imaging technique as a function of the accumulated phase of a probe beam that propagates through a cloud of atoms .",

    "the stabilized intensity has a rms fluctuation of 0.1% .",
    "typically , the power is adjusted on the order of milliseconds and the power is therefore not stabilized instantaneously , mainly due to heating of the optical fibers .",
    "however , the height of the potential is not critical during the first stages of the evaporation ( tens of seconds ) , where the thermal energy @xmath66 is large with respect to the dipole potential , ensuring the stability of the height of the potential long before the bec is formed . an alternative way of exciting a sound wave is by turning on the repulsive potential after the bec is formed . since this procedure is immediately sensitive to the height of the potential this alternative results in less reproducible excitations than the procedure used in our experiments . turning the dipole beam suddenly off ( ( 1/@xmath67)-time @xmath68 250 ns ) causes a local dip of the bec density .",
