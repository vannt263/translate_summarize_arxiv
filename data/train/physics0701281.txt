    "the brahms ( broad range hadron magnetic spectrometers ) collaboration is one of the four heavy ion experiments running currently at the brookhaven rhic .",
    "this experiment was designed to study particle production from colliding systems as varied as p+p , d+au and au+au in a wide rapidity range that extends from 0 to 4 units of rapidity ( maximum beam rapidity : 5.4 ) these measurements are primarily based on the extraction of inclusive transverse momentum distributions of fully identified particles with moderate reach in transverse momentum .",
    "particle identification at momenta lower than 7 gev / c is done via the time - of - flight technique and the more challenging task of identifying high momentum particles ( up and above 30 gev / c ) is tackled with a photo - multiplier based ring imaging erenkov detector ( rich ) described in the present paper .",
    "this detector is the last element of a two section , movable spectrometer called forward spectrometer ( fs ) .",
    "this spectrometer was designed to measure high momentum charged particles at angles with respect to the colliding beams that range from 30 to @xmath1 .",
    "tracking and momentum measurement is done with four dipole magnets , two tpcs in the first section of the spectrometer where occupancy can be high , and three drift chamber modules in the back section where lower occupancy and higher resolution provide precise measurement of momentum .",
    "the brahms rich shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : richphoto ] has a nominal radiator length of @xmath2 , and a @xmath3 spherical mirror with a radius @xmath4 .",
    "the mirror was manufactured as a slump formed glass substrate later polished to best commercial mirror surface quality .",
    "the polished surface was coated with al and a protective layer of @xmath5 .",
    "the mirror is rotated by @xmath6 to keep the photon detector out of the spectrometer acceptance .",
    "the photon detector is a photo - multiplier ( pmt ) based system described in section 3 .",
    "this array of pmts is placed on the focal plane of the rotated mirror .",
    "more details about the brahms experimental setup can be found in @xcite .",

    "erenkov light is a particular form of energy loss present whenever a charged particle moves through the bulk of a medium and its velocity is higher than the velocity of light in the medium @xmath8 ; this emitted light appears as a conical `` retarded wake '' of light that follows the particle .",
    "the energy loss associated to erenkov light emission is evaluated at distances much greater than the typical atomic lengths of the material and it appears as radiated photons of frequency @xmath9 whenever the velocity of the particle @xmath10 attains values such that the dielectric constant of the material @xmath11 and the particle velocity satisfy the relation @xmath12 see ref .",
    "the energy radiated per unit length is known as the frank - tamm relation :    @xmath13    the integrand between brackets is equal to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the angle of the emitted photon with respect to the particle velocity . from these relations it is possible to extract an estimate of the amount of light generated in a particular detector .",
    "the fact that erenkov light emission does not depend on a microscopic description of the medium implies that the emission is coherent , and it is another quantum effect visible in macroscopic systems .",
    "the index of refraction of the radiator medium written as : @xmath16 can be measured for the frequencies of interest .",
    "a set of such measurements can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the conical wave of erenkov light is transformed into a plane wave by reflection on a spherical mirror .",
    "if the angles of incidence to the mirror are small , all photons with the same angle of incidence are reflected onto a point on the focal plane , ( located at r/2 where r is the radius of the mirror ) and as erenkov light is emitted uniformly in the azimuthal angle @xmath17 ( defined with respect to the particle velocity ) , the focus of erenkov light reflected by an spherical mirror is a ring centered around a point related to the angle of incidence of the particle with respect to the axis of the mirror . within the approximation of small angles , an spherical mirror focusing erenkov light on a photon detector placed on its focal plane measures the charged particles angle of incidence and their velocity .",
    "the number of photon - electrons originating from a path of length l in the radiator volume is written as :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 ( in units of @xmath20 ) contains all the detector parameters :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the reflectivity of the spherical mirror set as independent of frequency and equal to 90% .",
    "@xmath23 is the quantum efficiency of the photomultiplier photo cathode .",
    "the pmts used in the brahms rich have borosilicate windows that set their quantum efficiency @xmath23 lower wave length cutoff at 250 nm and bialkali photocathodes with a maximum in efficiency of 20% .",
    "the calculated integral of @xmath23 for these pmts is equal to 0.33 ev .",
    "a fraction of the light , estimated to be equal to 9.7% , is lost when the photons traverse the 2.5 cm thick quartz window .",
    "the transmission of that window @xmath24 is thus set to 0.90 .",
    "finally the photon detector has dead areas between pmts that amount to an fiducial term @xmath25 equal to 0.7 .",
    "the expected figure of merit of the brahms rich is then equal to : @xmath26 .",
    "the focused light does nt form a perfect ring , chromatic and geometrical aberrations will distort it . the position resolution of the photon detector will also contribute to the spread of the photons away from a perfect circle .",
    "the angular or radial resolution of a ring imaging erenkov detector is critical at high values of momentum where the bands of radius versus momentum for different particles begin to merge .",
    "the width of these bands sets the particle discrimination power .",
    "as mentioned above , the resolution of the detector will be written as the sum in quadrature of the chromatic aberrations and the single hit radius resolution contribution :    @xmath27    @xmath28    the contribution from chromatic aberrations @xmath29 is present because the index of refraction in a dielectric depends on the frequency of the electromagnetic wave as @xmath16 .",
    "photons of different energy focus at different radii . for a particular detector sensitive to a finite band of wave lengths , the contribution of this distortion to the resolution of the detector can be simplified at high momentum values where @xmath30 and the maximum angle of emission can be written as : @xcite    @xmath31    the chromatic aberration can then be written as :    @xmath32    and    @xmath33",
    "@xmath34    the radius of a single focused photon has a fractional spread produced by chromatic aberration :    @xmath35    @xmath36 in these relations is set by the dynamic range of the photon detector and can be evaluated from measured values . in the case of the brahms",
    "rich the photon detector is an array of multianode photo - multipliers with a fwhm quantum efficiency equal to 2.7 ev ( from 250 nm to 517 nm ) .",
    "the radiator is a mixture of two heavy fluorocarbon gases @xmath37 and @xmath38 from 3 m @xcite .",
    "the index of refraction of the gas mixture was calculated using measurements performed in liquid phase , @xcite and the lorentz - lorenz equation .",
    "assuming an average index of refraction within the dynamic range of the pmts equal to @xmath39 , the chromatic aberration contribution to the resolution in the measurement of a single photon is equal to :    @xmath40    the four pixels of each r7600 photo - multiplier have square shapes with 1.1 cm on each side .",
    "for each of the measured photons , the error introduced in the ring radius measurement by the assumption that the photon intersects the detector plane at the center of the pixel is listed as :    @xmath41    with s = 1.1 cm and maximum ring radius of 8.7 cm the contribution to the radius resolution is equal to 0.036 .    to estimate the overall effect of the geometrical aberrations we have simulated the geometry of the detector and ray traced all erenkov photons produced by charged pions with fixed momentum set to 19 gev / c .",
    "two cases are considered , in the first one , a set of pions move all along the axis of symmetry of the detector .",
    "the deviation from a perfect ring is shown in the a and b panels of fig [ fig : geoaberr ] .",
    "panel a shows the distribution of the distance between the photon intersection with the detector plane and a nominal center of the ring .",
    "the azimuthal dependence of the deviation from a perfect ring ( for pions at 19 gev / c and @xmath42 ppm ) is shown in panel b. these deviations are all the result of the 9 degree rotation of the spherical mirror and the different positions of the emitted erenkov photons along the track of the charged pion .",
    "the photons with the smallest deviations are the ones emitted close to the mirror .",
    "the overall effect of mirror rotation and photon emission position is small and transforms the rings into ellipses with the big axis along the x axis of the photon detector .",
    "geometrical aberrations from ray tracing in the actual geometry of the detector . panels",
    "a and b correspond to the first set of pion moving all along the axis of the detector .",
    "panels c and d were obtained with measured tracks that have different angles of incidence as well as different entrance point locations , this set shows the strongest geometrical aberrations . for both sets of pions ,",
    "the left panel shows the distribution of radii , and the right ones display the relative deviation from a perfect circle as a function of the azimuth angle .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    a second set of charged pions with the same fixed momentum was used to extract an overall effect from geometrical aberrations .",
    "this time the tracks belong to detected particles and give us the most realistic distributions in slopes and intersections with the radiator volume .",
    "the result of ray tracing the cherenkov photons from this second set of pions is shown in panels c and d of fig .",
    "[ fig : geoaberr ] . the angles of incidence into",
    "the rich are small , the most distorted rings are produced by charged particles that fly close to the edges of the radiator volume .",
    "we can thus quote a maximum value for geometrical aberrations as @xmath43 even though the majority of the rings are contained in the bright band of panel d that corresponds to 0.7% once a particle is identified it is posible to correct the geometrical aberrations in an iterative way .",
    "the present analysis does not include this correction .",
    "a prototype of this detector was tested in one of the experimental halls at the bnl ags .",
    "these studies aimed at developing a photo - multiplier based photon detector in collaboration with hamamatsu corp . from an earlier pmt version with 256 pixels that provided the first rings , the development work continued to reduce the amount of charge shared between neighboring pixels .",
    "the second pmt version had @xmath44 pixel arranged in a 10x10 matrix .",
    "this device included an additional focusing stage between cathode and first dynode reducing the charge spread to 10% at the center of the next pixel @xcite , but had poor pulse height resolution , and was deemed too difficult to manufacture .",
    "finally we tested the r5900 four pixel pmt mounted in a compact metallic can . in order to achieve close packing af these tubes hamamtsu produced the r7600 03 m4f that was selected to be used in this detector .",
    "results obtained with the prototype can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the photon detector is an array of 80 four - pixel photomultipliers r7600 - 03-m4f @xcite .",
    "each pmt has a single photocathode plane evaporated on a borosilicate window .",
    "eleven dynodes amplify the electron extracted from the cathode and the total charge is collected in four independent anode plates .",
    "a focusing stage is placed between cathode and dynodes to reduced the charge shared between anodes .",
    "the complete system is encased in a flange - less metallic can held at the cathode voltage .",
    "close packing of these pmts was achieved by hamamatsu engineers with the design of a matrix of 5 x 4 biasing bases and sockets .",
    "each matrix has two high voltage connections such that a single channel of a hv power supply can bias ten pmts .",
    "the photo - multipliers placed in these matrices were selected to have similar gains and pulse height resolutions .",
    "the signal from each anode is routed out of each matrix through rg17 cables .",
    "the complete photon detector consists of four pmt matrices , and 70% of the total area is covered by active pixels .",
    "the output of these pmts is fast and has sufficient pulse height resolution , ( in average the single photo - electron peak appears as a shoulder of the distribution ) but their gain is insufficient to send the signal through some 100 meters of cable ( rg58 ) to be integrated in an adc with 50 fc coulomb resolution .",
    "this shortcoming of the pmt was compensated by the addition of one stage of amplification mounted right on the matrices of pmt bases .",
    "fast charge amplifiers were ac coupled to the anode output through impedance matching @xmath45 resistors to ground and a @xmath46 capacitor .",
    "3 shows one of the bias array with the five amplifier cards connected to it .",
    "the response of the r7600 pmts was studied with a well collimated led positioned in front of the photo - cathode with a two axis stepping motor system set to move in steps of 1 mm .",
    "the amount of light produced with green led is constant during the duration of the scan of one photo - multiplier and can thus be used to study the position dependence of the response of a particular pixel . as the led",
    "is 1 mm into the neighboring pixel it has 20% of the average pulse height in the center .",
    "two mm further away that fraction drops to @xmath47 and is negligible at the center of the next pixel .",
    "the 320 signal cables are connected to a lecroy 1885f fastbus adc after suitable delay to allow for a trigger definition for each rhic collision .",
    "the charge on each channel was integrated during a gate that lasted 120 ns .",
    "work performed on the prototype detector proved that the only filling procedure that guaranties the highest concentration of the gas mixture in the radiator volume is the one that starts by evacuating the volume .",
    "the drawback of this method is the need of a vessel designed to withstand a full atmosphere pressure differential .",
    "once the radiator volume was evacuated , a boil off of @xmath48 was introduced till the pressure reached 392 torr ( or 41.3% of the final mixture pressure of 1.25 atmospheres ) .",
    "after that , @xmath49 is sent into the radiator volume till the final mixture pressure is reached .",
    "once the filling is done , a small sample of the gas was used to measure the index of refraction by counting fringes in a young interferometer as one of the split beams of laser light goes through a volume that is filling with the gas sample , and the other passes through an equal length of vacuum .",
    "[ fig : fringes ] displays a portion of the fringes detected with a pin diode to convey their good definition that makes possible to make measurement of the index of refraction with a resolution of one part in a million .",

    "later , the focus of the collaboration shifted to studies at higher @xmath51 values and the gas mixture and operating pressure were changed to reduce the index of refraction to lower values ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "tracks reconstructed with the fs spectrometer tracking system are used to find the nominal center of rings . in case",
    "there are several tracks in the event , the loop over tracks is ordered such that it starts with the one with the highest momentum . once a ring center is defined , the distance from pixel center to ring center is calculated for all pixels that have charge above pedestal .",
