    "with the advent of femtosecond to attosecond x - ray sources @xcite , time resolved resonant core level x - ray spectroscopy @xcite has become a promising tool for studying electron and nuclear motions in real space and real time .",
    "resonant techniques provide detailed information beyond the charge density derived from time - resolved diffraction .",
    "nonlinear x - ray spectroscopy can monitor the dynamics such as making and breaking of chemical bonds at the molecular level .",
    "in a recent work @xcite we derived closed expressions for attosecond coherent stimulated x - ray raman signals ( cxrs ) .",
    "it was shown that cxrs can be expressed in terms of one - particle green s functions which depend parametrically on the core - hole . in this paper",
    "we extend this approach to study nonlinear x - ray spectra by combining the many - body green s function formulation with the exciton representation of valence electronic excitations .",
    "the exciton representation has been particularly useful for computing the optical valence excitations of molecular aggregates @xcite .",
    "s green s function approach @xcite provides an exact many - body formulation which avoids the computation of many - body wavefunctions . in most applications ,",
    "green s function theory requires a self - consistent computation which can become quite tedious and demanding as the system size grows .",
    "various approximations are therefore invoked in practical applications .",
    "the @xmath0 approximation @xcite constitutes a good compromise of accuracy and cost , and various variants have often been used in many applications of the green s function approach . by combining the exciton modelling of nonlinear response with many - body formulation",
    ", we can reduce the complexity of the green s function approach .",
    "we derive a bethe - salpeter ( bs ) type equation for two electron - hole pairs . in the standard bs equation@xcite ,",
    "the scattering matrix which represents the interaction between an electron and a hole , is expressed as a derivative of the one - particle self - energy with respect to the one - particle green s function which is then calculated using the @xmath0 approximation @xcite .",
    "a further simplification is introduced by taking the screened - coulomb interaction to be independent of the green s function@xcite . despite the lack of a rigorous justification ,",
    "this approach works well for a broad range of systems including isolated localized atoms and molecules@xcite , bulk semiconductors and insulators@xcite , conjugated polymers@xcite and infinite periodic crystals @xcite .",
    "it has been difficult to quantify the influence of the variation of screened potential with respect to green s function on the optical spectra because it involves an expensive self - consistent calculation of the derivative of the screened potential .",
    "here we employ the @xmath0 approximation to derive an algebraic expression for the electron - hole scattering matrix which only depends on the one - particle green s function .",
    "the variation of screened - coulomb potential is included approximately .",
    "this yields a simplified practical expression for the scattering - matrix which requires comparable efforts to computing the one - particle green s function at the @xmath0 level .",
    "we extend this result and combine it with the nonlinear exciton equation ( nee ) approach @xciteto compute nonlinear x - ray signals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the one- and two - particle green s functions parametrized in terms of core - holes . by defining a projection operator in the one - excitation space",
