    "the prompt emission from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) shows complex time profiles that have eluded a generally accepted explanation .",
    "@xcite reported a correlation between variability of grbs and the peak isotropic luminosity .",
    "the existence of the variability - luminosity correlation suggests that the prompt emission light curves have embedded temporal information related to the microphysics of grbs .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the observed temporal variability of grb light curves .",
    "leading models such as the internal shock model  @xcite and the photospheric model  @xcite link the rapid variability directly to the activity of the central engine .",
    "others invoke relativistic outflow mechanisms to suggest that local turbulence amplified through lorentz boosting leads to causally disconnected regions which in turn act as independent centers for the observed prompt emission . within more recent models ,",
    "both @xcite and @xcite argue that the temporal variability may show two different scales depending on the physical mechanisms generating the prompt emission .    in order to further our understanding of the prompt emission phase of grbs and to explicitly test some of the key ingredients in the various models ,",
    "it is clearly important to extract the variability for both short and long gamma - ray bursts in a robust and unbiased manner .",
    "it is also clear that the chosen methodology should not only be mathematically rigorous but also be sufficiently flexible to apply to transient phenomena with multiple time scales and a wide dynamic range .",
    "a wide dynamic range is naturally provided by the bimodal separation of grb duration occurring at @xmath0 sec as observed by  @xcite to distinguish between long and short duration grbs .    in this paper",
    ", we extract variability time scales for grbs using a method based on wavelets .",
    "the technique for such a temporal analysis is universal , and has the advantage over fourier analysis that transients and frequency correlations can be more easily picked out in the data .",
    "results presented herein were compared with @xcite who gave pulse parameters for approximately 400 pulses obtained from 34 grbs .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the minimum variablility time scale tracks the rise times of pulses very well for over three orders of magnitude in time scale .",
    "the relation of minimum variability time scales to pulse parameters has been extended to four orders of magnitude by @xcite who applied the present technique to analyze x - ray flares .",
    "the time scales being investigated here have power densities very near to that of the noise in the data which makes extracting these time scales nontrivial .",
    "a somewhat older but still interesting discussion of extracting signal in a noisy environment can be found in  @xcite and a more recent discussion found in  @xcite .",
    "the technique we offer is not necessarily new but is different from previous published wavelet analyses  @xcite in that we apply a number of modifications suggested by various authors  @xcite as explained further in sec  [ dataanalysis ] .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : the source of the data is described in section 2 ; the main aspects of the wavelet methodology are outlined in section 3 ; in section 4 we provide the details of the data analysis ; in section 5 we present and discuss our main findings ; finally , in section 6 , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) on board fermi observes grbs in the energy range 8  kev to 40  mev .",
    "the gbm is composed of 12 thallium - activated sodium iodide ( nai ) scintillation detectors ( 12.7 cm in diameter by 1.27 cm thick ) that are sensitive to energies in the range of 8 kev to 1 mev , and two bismuth germanate ( bgo ) scintillation detectors ( 12.7 cm diameter by 12.7 cm thick ) with energy coverage between 200 kev and 40 mev .",
    "the gbm detectors are arranged in such a way that they provide a significant view of the sky @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have extracted light curves for the gbm nai detectors over the entire energy range ( 8 kev - 1 mev , also including the overflow beyond  1 mev ) .",
    "typically , the brightest three nai detectors were chosen for the extraction .",
    "lightcurves for both long and short grbs were extracted at a time binning of 200 microseconds .",
    "the long grbs were extracted over a duration starting from 20 seconds before the trigger and up to about 50 seconds after the @xmath1 for the burst without any background subtraction . for short grbs",
    ", durations were chosen to be 20 seconds before the trigger and 10 seconds after the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 durations were obtained from the fermi gbm - burst catalog  @xcite .",
    "we report on our model - independent statistical investigation of the variability of fermi / gbm long and short grbs .",
    "we extract this information by using a fast wavelet transformation to encode grb light curves into a wavelet representation and then compute a statistical measure of the variance of wavelet coefficients over multiple time - scales .",
    "it is often the case when multiple processes are present that one process will dominate the others at certain time scales but those same processes may exchange dominance at other time scales .",
    "a wavelet technique is useful in these situations because the variances of wavelet coefficients are sensitive to whichever processes dominate the light curve at a given time scale .",
    "moreover , the technique can be used to classify those dominant processes as well as provide a means to determine the characteristic time scale , @xmath2 , for which the processes exchange dominance .",
    "determination of @xmath2 helps in the development of theoretical models and the understanding of observational data . indeed ,",
    "if there is a transition from a time - scaling region to that of white noise then there is a smallest variability time for the physical processes present .",
    "wavelet transformations have been shown to be a natural tool for multi - resolution analysis of non - stationary time - series @xcite .",
    "wavelet analysis is similar to fourier analysis in many respects but differs in that wavelet basis functions are well - localized , _",
    "i.e. _ have compact support , while fourier basis functions are global .",
    "compact support means that outside some finite range the amplitude of wavelet basis functions goes to zero or is otherwise negligibly small @xcite . in principle , a wavelet expansion forms a faithful representation of the original data , in that the basis set is orthonormal and complete .",
    "given the discrete nature of the data , we employ a discrete wavelet analysis .",
    "the rescaled - translated nature of the wavelet basis functions make the wavelet transform well - localized in both frequency and time , which results in an insensitivity to background photon counts expressed by polynomial fits .",
    "the level of insensitivity , formally known as the vanishing moment condition , can be adjusted by the choice of wavelet basis function . by construction ,",
    "the discrete wavelet transform is a multi - resolution operation @xcite .",
    "such wavelets , denoted @xmath3 , form a dyadic basis set , i.e. wavelets in the set have variable widths and variable central time positions .    the wavelet analysis employed in this study , as with the fast fourier transform , begins with a light curve with @xmath4 elements , @xmath5 where @xmath4 is an integer power of two .",
    "the light curve is convolved with a scaling function , @xmath6 , and wavelet function , @xmath7 which are rescaled and translated versions of the original scaling and wavelet functions @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "translation is indexed by @xmath10 and rescaling is indexed by @xmath11 .",
    "the rescaling and translation relation is given by @xmath12    the precise forms of the scaling and wavelet functions are not unique .",
    "the choices are made according to the features one wishes to exploit  @xcite .",
    "the scaling function acts as a smoothing filter for the input time - series and the wavelet function probes the time - series for detail information at some time scale , @xmath13 , which is twice that of the finest binning of the data , @xmath14 . in the analysis ,",
    "the time scale is doubled @xmath15 and the transform is repeated until @xmath16    in this analysis we choose the haar  @xcite scaling / wavelet basis because it has the smallest possible support , has one vanishing moment , and is equivalent to the allan variance  @xcite , allowing for a straightforward interpretation .      convolving the light curve , @xmath17 , with the scaling functions yields approximation coefficients , @xmath18    interrogating @xmath17 with the wavelet basis functions yields scale and position dependent detail coefficients , @xmath19 it is interesting to point out that for the trivial @xmath20 case the haar wavelet transform and the fourier transform are identical .",
    "logscale diagrams are useful for identifying scaling and noise regions .",
    "construction of a logscale diagram for each grb proceeds from the variance of detail coefficients @xcite , @xmath21 where the @xmath22 are the number of detail coefficients at a particular scale , @xmath11 .",
    "a plot of @xmath23 variances versus scale , @xmath11 , takes the general form @xmath24 and is known as a logscale diagram .",
    "a linear regression is made of each logscale diagram and the slope parameter , @xmath25 , ( depicting a measure of scaling ) is estimated .",
    "white - noise processes appear in logscale diagrams as flat regions while non - stationary processes appear as sloped regions with the following condition on the slope parameter , @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we now present a method for removing photometric background due to noise not intrinsic to the grb so that physical variability arising from the grb remains for further analysis .",
    "background subtraction for a statistical analysis of variability via wavelet transforms should proceed in the space variances as opposed to a traditional flat or linear subtraction of counts .",
    "this owes to the fact that haar detail coefficients are insensitive to polynomial trends in the signal up to first order .",
    "subtraction of a flat or linear background from a light curve is an operation under which the wavelet transform is invariant ( as are fourier transforms ) apart from the mean signal coefficient .",
    "the grb light curves show power at various variablity time scales . most often , there is a region of the logscale diagram ( log - power verses log - varibility time ) with a single slope , indicating scaling in the power over those variability - times , and a flat region at the shortest variability times , indicating the presence of white - noise",
    ". some of this white - noise may be intrinsic to the grb .",
    "some may be attributed to instrumental noise and to background emissions from sources not including the grb in question .",
    "we therefore express the variability of the burst , @xmath27 , at time scales @xmath11 as comprising of individual variances : a scaling component , @xmath28 ; an intrinsic noise component , @xmath29 ; and a background component , @xmath30 .",
    "the variability of the burst can then be described as a linear combination of the component variances so long as the components have vanishing covariances . in this event",
    "we write , @xmath31 the minimum variability time scale , @xmath2 , is identified from a logscale diagram by the octave , @xmath32 , of the intersection of the flat intrinsic noise domain , @xmath33 , with the sloped scaling domain , @xmath34 , @xmath35 in practice , the octave at which the intersection occurs is determined by equating the polynomial fits to the flat intrinsic noise domain and the sloped scaling domain and solving for @xmath36 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath2 is determined by propagating the uncertainty in the parameters from the fits to the @xmath37 which in turn follow from a bootstrap procedure described in sec .",
    "[ circperm ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : rtc ] .",
    "it is at this time scale , @xmath2 , that a structured physical process appears to give way to one that is stochastic and unstructured .",
    "clearly one seeks to remove @xmath38 from eq .",
    "[ eq : sumofvariances ] to arrive at the cleanest possible signal , @xmath39    in order to estimate the variance of the background during the burst , we will assume that the variance obtained from a preburst portion of the light curve can serve as an acceptable surrogate for the background variance .",
    "that is , @xmath40 and then the background is removed from the signal according to the relation , @xmath41 a simple algebraic manipulation of eq .",
    "[ eq : correction1 ] gives a form , @xmath42 for long grbs , the preburst is defined relative to a 0 s trigger time as t-20 s to t-5 s and for short grbs the preburst is defined to be from t-15 s to t-1 s. here t is the trigger time of the burst .",
    "we have considered the statistical uncertainties in the light curve by a typical bootstrap approach in which the square root of the number of counts per bin is used to generate an additive poisson noise .",
    "a new poisson noise is considered for each iteration through the bootstrap process .",
    "more significant contributions to the uncertaintaies are discussed in sec .",
    "[ circperm ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : rtc ] .",
    "spurious artifacts due to incidental symmetries resulting from accidental misalignment @xcite of light curves with wavelet basis functions are minimized by circularly shifting the light curve against the basis functions .",
    "circular shifting is a form of translation invariant de - noising  @xcite .",
    "it is possible a shift will introduce additional artifacts by moving a different symmetry into a susceptible location .",
    "thus , our approach is to circulate the signal through all possible values , or at least a representative sampling , and then take an average over the cases which do not show spurious correlations .",
    "both discrete fourier and discrete wavelet transformations imply an overall periodicity equal to the full time - range of the input data .",
    "this can be interpreted to mean that for a series of @xmath4 elements , @xmath43 then @xmath44 is made a surrogate for @xmath45 and @xmath46 is made a surrogate for @xmath47 , and so forth .",
    "this assumption may lead to trouble if @xmath44 is much different from @xmath48 . in this case ,",
    "artificially large variances may be computed .",
    "reverse - tail concatenation minimizes this problem by making a copy of the series which is then reversed and concatenated onto the end of the original series resulting in a new series with a length twice that of the original .",
    "instead of matching boundary conditions like , @xmath49 we match boundaries as , @xmath50 note that the series length has thus artificially been increased to @xmath51 by reversing and doubling of the original series .",
    "consequently , the wavelet variances at the largest scale in a logscale diagram reflect this redundancy .",
    "this is the reason the wavelet variances at the largest scale are excluded from least - squares fits of the scaling region .",
    "another difficulty in wavelet expansions is that the initialization procedure of the multi - resolution algorithm may pollute the detail coefficients at the finest scale ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason we follow the advice of  @xcite and discard the detail coefficients at the finest scale .",
    "equal to 6 and 7 for various brightness .",
    "we show in gray the region along the @xmath52-axis where we find the grbs analyzed in this paper , @xmath53 .",
    "we note that in the region covered by the grbs presented herein , brightness does not affect @xmath54 greatly . , width=317 ]    the efficacy of this background subtraction method and the sensitivity to signal to noise was tested using simulated data in the form of fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) time series that were first discussed by @xcite .",
    "one advantage of using fbms for simulation of time series data is that short duration , statistically significant fluctuations which trigger the identification of a minimum variability time scale arise naturally as part of the random process which produces them .",
    "another is that fbms have a scaling parameter , @xmath25 , which is easily varied .",
    "the outline of the simulation procedure begins with using the numerical computing environment matlab to produce 1000 realizations of fbms with scaling parameter @xmath25 randomly chosen from the range @xmath55 by using a uniform random number generator .",
    "the fbms were then acted upon by a poisson operator which transformed each time series into a poisson - distributed series but left other properties of the fbm intact , e.g. , @xmath25 .",
    "the fbms were then combined with a poisson noise with variance , @xmath56 .",
    "these poisson noises were regarded as intrinsic to the grb .",
    "another set of poisson noises with variances , @xmath57 , were generated and these noise signals were interpreted as external _ background _ meant to be removed by the subtraction procedure .",

    "we find that a decrease in flux has essentially the same effect on @xmath2 as increasing the noise level .",
    "however , the largest effect was by the wider bite of counts .",
    "for example , one can expect more accurate results from this analysis by removing 30 - 40% of counts on a bin to bin basis than by removing 25 - 50% .",

    "the results indicate that the background subtraction method is robust and gives confidence that external background noise can be subtracted from the grb light curves with the assumption that preburst data can serve as a surrogate for background noise .",

    "( 2 ) the two histograms are quite broad and very similar in dispersion . while the difference in the mean @xmath2 is understandable ( a point we discuss further elsewhere ) the similarity of the dispersion is somewhat surprising since the progenitors and the environment for the two types of bursts are presumably very different .",

    "note that the dispersion of the @xmath2 histogram ( for long bursts ) is in agreement with the results of @xcite who performed a power density spectral analysis of a large sample of swift long grbs . in that work the authors extracted threshold frequencies and related them to a variability scale .    in fig .",
    "[ tauvt90obs ] we show a log - log plot of @xmath2 versus @xmath1 ( the duration of the bursts ) ; long grbs are indicated by circles , the short ones by squares and both time scales are with respect to the observer frame . as in the histograms",

    "the situation for the long - burst group on the other hand is not immediately clear . in order to explore this",

    "[ tauvt90obs ] ) the appearance of a very intriguing feature : a plateau region in which the @xmath2 is essentially independent of @xmath1 and a scaling region in which the @xmath2 appears to increase with @xmath1 , with the transition occurring around @xmath1 on the order of a few seconds .",
    "if one assumes a positive correlation between luminosity and variability as suggested by a number of authors , then one might expect smaller @xmath2 values for higher luminosity bursts compared to those of lower luminosity . to investigate this , the data ( in fig .",

    "[ tauvt90lum ] that no obvious connection between @xmath2 and luminosity is evident .    under the assumption that the @xmath2 is a measure proportional to the smallest causally - connected structure associated with a grb light curve , it is then possible to interpret the scaling trend in terms of the internal shock model in which the basic units of emission are assumed to be pulses that are produced via the collision of relativistic shells emitted by the central engine .",
    "indeed , we note that @xcite in their study of the brightest batse bursts with @xmath1 @xmath69 sec explicitly identified and fitted distinct pulses and demonstrated a strong positive correlation between the number of pulses and the duration of the burst .",
    "more recent studies @xcite provide further evidence for the pulse paradigm view of the prompt emission in grbs .",
    "in our work we have not relied on identifying distinct pulses but instead have used the multi - resolution capacity of the wavelet technique to resolve the smallest temporal scale present in the prompt emission .",
    "if the smallest temporal scale is made from pulse emissions from the smallest structures , then we can get a measure of the number of pulses in a given burst through the ratio @xmath1/@xmath2 . in the simple model in which a pulse is produced every time",

    "a plot of this ratio versus @xmath1 is shown for a sample of short and long bursts in fig .",

    "formation of an accretion disk in the two cases is posed in a number of models but important factors such as the size of the disk , the mass of the disk , the strength of the magnetic field , in addition to the magnitude of the accretion rate during the prompt phase , remain largely uncertain . with contributions from intrinsic variability of the central engine or nearby shock - wave interactions within a jet , we should not be surprised to observe a systematic difference in the extracted variability time scales for long and short bursts , since the progenitors have different spatial scales . knowing the variability timescales , we can estimate the size of an assumed emission region . from fig .",
    "[ tauvt90obs ] , we note that the smallest temporal - variability scale for the short bursts is approximately 3 ms and that for the long bursts is approximately 30 ms : these times translate to emission scales of approximately @xmath71 and @xmath72 cm respectively .",
    "our variability times and size scales are generally consistent with the findings of @xcite although these authors also reported observing time scales as small as few microseconds .",
    "we find no evidence for variability times as low as a few microseconds .",
    "@xcite modeled the behavior of a jet propagating through the progenitor and the surrounding circumstellar material and showed that the resulting light curves exhibited both short - term and long  term variability .",
    "they attribute the long - term variability , at the scale of few seconds , to the interaction of the jet with the progenitor .",
    "the short - term scale , at the level of milliseconds , they attribute to the variation in the activity of the central engine itself . alternatively ,",
    "@xcite consider a model in which the prompt emission is the result of a magnetically powered outflow which is self - interacting and triggers rapid turbulent reconnections to power the observed grbs .",
    "this model also predicts two variability components but interestingly and in contrast to the findings of @xcite , it is the slow component that is associated with the activity of the central engine , and the fast component is linked to relativistic magnetic turbulence . while we are not in a position to distinguish between these two models it is intriguing nonetheless to note ( see fig .  [ tauvt90obs ] ) that indeed there do appear to be two distinct time domains for the @xmath2 : a plateau region dominated primarily by short bursts although it includes some long bursts too , and a scaling region ( i.e. , a hint of a correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) that is comprised solely of long bursts .",
    "in addition , we observe that the time scale in the plateau region is the order of milliseconds whereas that for the scaling region is approaching seconds .",
    "there is considerable dispersion in the extracted @xmath2 .",
    "the variation is evident for both short and long - duration grbs .",
    "the main cause of this dispersion is not fully understood but one factor that may play a significant role is angular momentum . as @xcite note , the basic features of the prompt emission can be understood in terms of accretion that results via a simple ballistic infall of material from a rapidly rotating progenitor .",
    "material with low angular momentum will radially accrete across the event horizon whereas the material with sufficient angular momentum will tend to circularize outside the innermost stable circular orbit and form an accretion disk .",
    "simulations that go beyond the simple radial infall model @xcite suggest that the formation of the disk leads to an accretion shock that traverses outwards through the infalling material .",
    "if one assumes that the initiation of such an accretion shock and the subsequent emission of the prompt gamma - rays are associated with a particular time scale , the variability of this scale then ( as given by the dispersion in @xmath2 for example ) may reflect the different dynamics ( initial angular momentum and the mass of the black hole ) of each grb in our sample . in the case of long grbs , the mass of the central black hole can vary by an order of magnitude thus potentially explaining a large part of the dispersion seen in the @xmath2 .",
    "however a similar dispersion for short bursts is difficult to reconcile using the same arguments since the mass range for the central black hole in standard merger models ( at least for ns - ns mergers ) is expected to be significantly smaller .",
    "we have studied the temporal properties of a sample of prompt - emission light curves for short and long - duration grbs detected by the fermi / gbm mission . by using a technique based on wavelets we have extracted the variability timescales for these bursts .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    \\a ) both short and long - duration bursts indicate a temporal variability at the level of a few milliseconds .",
    "variability of this order appears to be a common feature of grbs .",
    "this finding is consistent with the work of @xcite .",
    "however , unlike these authors we do not find evidence of variability at a time scale of few microseconds .",
    "\\b ) in general the short - duration bursts have a variability time scale that is significantly shorter than long - duration bursts .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2 values seem not to depend in any obvious way on the luminosity of the bursts . the dispersion over different grbs in the extracted time scale for short - duration bursts is an order of magnitude within the smallest variability time , that time being approximately 3 milliseconds .",
    "the dispersion for the long - duration bursts is somewhat larger .",
    "the origin of the dispersion in either case is not known , although we should expect that the size of the initial angular momentum and the mass of the system play significant roles .",
    "we note in passing that the 3 millisecond time scale may not be a physical lower limit and may be a result of signal to noise and the set of grbs used in this analysis .",
    "we remind the reader that our light curve resolution was 200 @xmath73s and if a strong enough signal within a range of time scales between 0.5 - 3 milliseconds were present we would expect our technique to be sensitive to it .",
    "\\c ) the ratio of @xmath74 appears to be positively correlated with the minimum variability time scale .",
    "this suggests further support for the pulse paradigm view of the prompt emission as being the result of shell collisions . in this respect ,",
    "the minimum variability time scale is likely related to key pulse parameters such as risetimes and/or widths .",
    "\\d ) for short - duration bursts , the variability parameter @xmath2 shows negligible dependence on the duration of the bursts ( characterized by @xmath1 ) .",
    "in contrast , the long - duration bursts indicate evidence for two variability time scales : a plateau region ( at the shortest time scale ) which is essentially independent of burst duration and a scaling region ( at the higher time scale ) that shows a positive correlation with burst duration .",
    "the transition between the two regions occurs around @xmath1 on the order of a few seconds in the source frame .",
