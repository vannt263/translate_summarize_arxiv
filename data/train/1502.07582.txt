    "the fundamental fact that every link has a seifert surface was proven by seifert in 1935 ( @xcite ) .",
    "he presented an algorithm , now known as the seifert algorithm , which allows the construction of a seifert surface for any link .",
    "it laid the foundation for numerous methods for studying knots .",
    "for instance , a seifert surface is required to define the associated seifert matrix , which is then required for the definition of important knot invariants such as the knot signature or the alexander polynomial ( @xcite ) .",
    "the seifert algorithm produces a set of disjoint closed curves .",
    "these curves are known as _ seifert circles_. we distinguish two types of seifert circles like @xcite .",

    "seifert discs_. likewise , if the seifert disc is bounded by a type i seifert circle ( respectively type ii ) we call it _ type i seifert disc _",
    "( respectively _ type ii _ ) .",
    "the seifert discs are connected by half twisted bands to produce the seifert surface .",
    "such a half twisted band is called _ positive _ ( respectively _ negative _ ) if it was obtained from a positive ( respectively negative ) crossing .",
    "a canonical seifert surface is constructed from seifert discs , half twisted bands and unknotted tubes .",

    "in conclusion , stretching the interval @xmath8 into @xmath24 except for inward bands where the interval is outside of @xmath24 removes the type ii seifert disc @xmath24 at the cost of adding two new bands and two new type i seifert discs for every inward band .",

    "we already mentioned that the seifert surface is the basis for many important concepts in knot theory .",
    "a further concept based on the seifert surface is the representation of a canonical seifert surface as a graph .",
    "we saw that the seifert algorithm produces a set of disjoint discs that are eventually connected by half twisted bands and possibly unknotted tubes .",
    "for every component of a canonical seifert surface we can construct a planar graph from the discs and their connecting half twisted bands .",
    "this graph representation is helpful because we can apply well known results from graph theory to gain information about the surface .",

    "then , the _ seifert graph _ of @xmath1 is the graph @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the set of vertices and @xmath44 the set of edges .",
    "the seifert graph of a canonical seifert surface has several useful properties which allow us to proof lemma [ lem : graph_limitation ] .",

    "we know that the seifert graph is planar , bipartite and has no loops .",
    "as the graph is planar it can be embedded in the sphere @xmath48 .",
    "such an embedding divides @xmath48 into a finite number of faces .",
    "let @xmath49 be the number of vertices , @xmath50 the number of edges and @xmath51 the number of faces .",
    "it is a well known fact for the euler characteristic ( theorem 5.a.1 in @xcite ) that @xmath52    in the following we require that the faces stem from the seifert graph diagram which is directly induced by the canonical seifert surface .",
    "furthermore , it is essential to have a canonical seifert surface without type ii seifert discs .",
    "the reason is that without type ii seifert discs , the surface can be reconstructed from the vertices , edges and faces .",
    "each vertex gives rise to a seifert disc and each edge to a half twisted band ( the sign is not important here ) .",
    "note that this is not possible for type ii discs because we lose the information about how the type ii discs are connected by the half twisted bands .",
    "so , by showing that the directly induced seifert graph diagram leads to a contradiction we can conclude that such a canonical seifert surface could not have existed .",
    "continuing with the proof , from the fact that there are no loops in the seifert graph we conclude that every face has more than one edge .",
    "the assumption that there are no adjacent bands is equivalent with the property that every face is bounded by more than two edges .",
    "furthermore , every face is bounded by an even number of edges because otherwise there would be a circuit of uneven length , which would violate the bipartiteness of the graph . in conclusion",
    ", every face is bounded by at least four edges . from these observations",
    "it follows that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an enumeration of all faces and @xmath55 is the number of edges bounding face @xmath56 .",
    "the reason why the sum equals twice the edge count is the following .",
    "each edge belongs to the boundary of two faces .",
    "therefore , by summing over all faces each edge is counted twice .    from ( [ eq : euler_characteristic ] ) and ( [ eq : face_edge_relation ] ) follows @xmath57    because every seifert disc is of degree at least four , every vertex has degree at least four .",

    "the reason why the sum equals twice the edge count is that each edge is incident to two vertices . therefore , by summing over all vertices each edge is counted twice .    the inequalities ( [ eq : vertex_edge_limit ] ) and ( [ eq : vertex_edge_relation ] ) yield the contradiction @xmath62",
    "it is a fact that not every seifert surface is twist trivial .",
    "a necessary condition can be found by studying the fundamental group of the surface complement .",
    "notice that applying a ribbon twist preserves the fundamental group of the surface complement .",
    "therefore , if two surfaces @xmath63 are twist equivalent then the fundamental groups of their surface complements are isomorphic , @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the standard n - fold torus with m holes to which @xmath1 is twist equivalent .",
    "from the fact that neither a ribbon twist nor an isotopy changes the fundamental group @xmath14 it follows that @xmath65 .",
    "the seifert - van kampen theorem (  70 in @xcite or 1.2 in @xcite ) implies that @xmath66 , the free group of @xmath67 generators .    from this necessary condition",
    "it is straightforward to construct a surface that can not be twist trivial .",
    "many satellite knots and links ( @xcite or @xcite ) serve as counterexamples . for instance , take @xmath68 to be the cable link of the trivial two component link with the trefoil knot as its companion ( figure [ fig : free_group_example ] ) . a possible",

    "thus , the surface @xmath1 can not be a canonical seifert surface ( @xcite ) nor can it be twist trivial .",
    "this is also intuitively obvious for this example because a ribbon twist can only add full twists to the band .",
    "however , this will obviously never unknot the surface and so it can not be twist trivial .",
