    "while in the emto+dmft approach the self - energy is added to the scattering path operator , from which the charge density is obtained by a complex contour integration , in the latter kkr+dmft approach the self - energy is added directly to the radial dirac solver from where the regular and irregular solutions are computed directly . in both these emto and kkr green function schemes ,",
    "the lda solver is formulated within the complex plane .",
    "therefore the combination with the many - body problem requires the `` transfer '' from the complex plane to the imaginary axis or the real axis where the many - body problem is solved . in both these implementations ,",

    "an analytic function @xmath45 can be uniquely specified by values contained in a compact set .",
    "construction of a sequence of rational functions @xmath46 having the same values as @xmath45 on a given set of points is known as the rational interpolation problem .",
    "the pad approximant method is a possible way to solve the rational interpolation problem , and has proved very useful in providing quantitative information about the solution of many interesting problems in physics and chemistry .",
    "one of the most used techniques to construct the pad approximant is the thiele reciprocal difference method which was pioneered in the field of condensed matter physics by vidberg and serene @xcite who used it as a means to analytically continue spectral functions from the imaginary axis to the real axis .",
    "the method of thiele takes values @xmath47 from @xmath48 ( complex ) points @xmath49 as input and returns an analytically continued function value @xmath50 at a point @xmath51 .",

    "hence , if the goal is to approximate a spectral function with @xmath57 number of poles , then @xmath58 input points should be used . in general @xmath57 is not known _ a priori_. to resolve this issue vidberg and serene",
    "@xcite observed that a good approximant can be expected by increasing @xmath48 until the number of approximant poles in the lower half of the complex plane converges to a fixed value .",
    "later on , the pad approximant method was scrutinized by beach et al .",
    "@xcite who introduced the matrix formulation , which allows to compute the rational polynomial coefficients from which the approximant is constructed",
    ". as these coefficients are obtained by a matrix inversion the issue of accuracy is addressed using a multi - precision arithmetic in the calculation of the rational polynomial . in that study the approximant @xmath59",
    "was calculated explicitly by solving a linear system of @xmath48 ( @xmath48 even ) equations to get the complex polynomial coefficients @xmath60 . in the following section we will present several issues concerning the use of the pad method in electronic band structure calculations , in particular for the emto implementation .",

    ", the pad approximant needs to be constructed for each @xmath63 ibz and the bloch sum is performed at the desired point . along the dashed path , only one single pad approximant is needed . ]    in the case of the * k*-resolved green s function in eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) , excluding @xmath31 , we have some _ a priori _ knowledge of the pole structure .",
    "this is because each orbital contributes with at least one pole ( hybridization between bands will in general give rise to more than a single pole ) . on the other hand , the pole structure of the local green s function in eq .",
    "( [ gtilde ] ) is not known explicitly .",
    "since the ideal pad approximant of a function @xmath1 by construction is a rational polynomial , it has a clearly defined pole structure . hence performing the analytic continuation on the * k*-resolved green s function should be more suitable .",
    "the two different procedures are shown schematically in figure [ kvsloc ] , and we focus in this article on the spectral properties ( density of states ) generated in these procedures , leaving out the self - energy . in the next subsection",
    "we discuss pole - zero pairs of the approximant in the complex plane .",
    "an important issue is the nearly canceling pole - zero pairs in the pad approximant .",
    "these pairs arise when the order of the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ poly ] ) is larger than the actual number of poles present in the function to be analytically continued . in the spirit of the matrix formulation of beach",
    "@xcite , in such cases the linear equations used to solve the rational interpolation problem becomes overcomplete .",
    "if this happens , the pad algorithm tries to cancel the spurious poles by placing a zero of the numerator at the location of the pole .",
    "the pole - zero cancellation will not be exact due to the lack of arbitrary precision .",
    "these pole - zero pairs are defects in the approximant , since they are not part of the true function .",
    "hence , these pairs should be found by performing a root - search on both the denominator and nominator polynomial and once found be removed from the approximant . assuming that we have found a set of @xmath64 pole - zero pairs @xmath65 , where the @xmath66 s are zeros and the @xmath67 s are poles of the approximant",
    ", the pairs can be filtered out by the following operation @xmath68 in general it is difficult to make any clear statement on where exactly in the complex plane these pole - zero pairs will appear .",
    "there are theorems about the overall distribution @xcite , however for the present problem they are too general to be of any practical use .",
    "a pertinent question is how to decide which poles are physical and which are spurious .",
    "the most obvious way would be to make a geometric search in the complex plane and investigate whether a chosen pole has a zero in its neighborhood .",
    "one of the simplest ways would be to let the neighborhood be a circle of some predefined radius .",
    "this straightforward method has some pitfalls .",
    "it is for example not obvious how to specify the neighbourhood in the most optimal way since the pole - zero pairs usually have different separations , as will be seen in sec .",
    "[ proposenumtest ] .",
    "if the neighborhood is defined too large then more than one zero can be present inside leading to ambiguity or the accidental removal of a physical zero .",
    "if on the other hand the neighborhood is chosen too small , a spurious pole in a pole - zero pair with a large separation could mistakenly be considered as a true pole of the approximant . hence , in practice , this method is difficult to implement inside any self - consistent loop , where an algorithm would be necessary to automate the filtering of defects .",
    "another approach to select the true poles is to add a complex random number to the original input data , which was done by sokolovski et al . for s - matrix elements",
    "the reasoning behind this method is that the physical poles should be insensitive to this ( numerical ) perturbation while the spurious pole - zero pairs should redistribute themselves in the complex plane . adding a random number to the input green s function",
    "would effectively lead to adding an extra zero to the nominator , affecting the asymptotic properties of the green s function . in this study , we chose to multiply the input green s function with real positive random numbers , in order to conserve the asymptotic properties of the function .",
    "notice that multiplicative positive noise only leads to a rescaling of the pole weights , but keeps the asymptotic properties intact .",
    "accordingly , the input green s function is multiplied with real positive random numbers of the form    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is a real scaling factor and the @xmath71 s are real random numbers between @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ".      one can learn more about the pad approximant by writing it as a product of its poles and zeros ( second to lhs eq .",
    "( [ defwi ] ) ) , and as a sum of its poles and residues ( rhs eq .",
    "( [ defwi ] ) ) viz .",
    "@xmath74 where @xmath75 is the residue ( or _ weight _ ) of the @xmath76th pole .",
    "@xmath77 is a multiplicative complex constant that needs to be added back when reassembling the approximant as a product of its poles and zeros .",
    "this is because the root - finding procedure is invariant up to a scaling factor for the polynomial coefficients .",
    "the weights @xmath75 can be found by some algebra .",
    "multiply eq .",
    "( [ defwi ] ) with @xmath78 @xmath79 after some rearrangement we arrive at @xmath80 if we now set @xmath81 we finally get that @xmath82 notice that all the poles have to be non - degenerate to avoid dividing by zero .",
    "extension to degenerate poles will be considered in a future study .",
    "it is now possible to make a connection with two theorems ( theorem 43.1 in @xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite ) stating the relationship between a sum of the form in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ defwi ] ) and its analytic properties .",
    "these theorems imply that if all the @xmath75 s are positive and all the @xmath67 s are real , the approximant has positive - definite , integrable spectral weight and is analytic except along the real axis . in the spirit of beach et al .",
    "@xcite , this is what is needed for the spectral function to be physical . using the above information",
    ", one can single out the physical poles from the defective ones , and write the approximant as @xmath83 where the prime indicates that the sum should be taken over physical poles only .",
    "which poles that are true physical poles or defects should be decided on the ground of the above theorems .",
    "for example , if a pole has negative residue it can be considered unphysical and be removed .",
    "the pad method will in general assign a non - zero imaginary part to the residues due to lack of arbitrary precision , even to the physical poles as is shown in sec .",
    "[ proposenumtest ] .",
    "hence the exclusion of poles from the approximant due to non - zero imaginary parts has limited use .",
    "after consideration of the above issues , we propose and test the following scheme to perform the pad analytic continuation of the green s functions in the emto+dmft method :    * calculate the * k*-resolved lsda green s function ( the integrand in eq . ( [ nos ] ) ) and construct a pad approximant for each * k*-point . perform the bloch sum only after the analytic continuation has been performed .",

    "the instabilities often encountered when using these methods should be attributed to the ill - posedness of analytic continuation in general , and not to the pad method itself . indeed , as has been shown earlier @xcite the method can reach remarkable accuracy when the conditions concerning input precision and arithmetics are good enough .",
    "typically this is not the case for electronic band structure calculations .",
    "however , our study shows that the analytic continuation can give acceptable results if special consideration is taken .",
    "the important issue to resolve is to be able to ensure that no spurious poles or zeros enter the complex half - plane in which the contour integrations and many - body equations are solved .",
    "as shown in this work , the above goal can be reached once the locations of the approximant poles and zeros are known , as one is then able to use the properties of the approximant to remove any unphysical features .",

    "<S> we investigate one of the most common analytic continuation techniques in condensed matter physics , namely the pad approximant . </S>",
    "<S> aspects concerning its implementation in the exact muffin - tin orbitals ( emto ) method are scrutinized with special regard towards making it stable and free of artificial defects . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure calculations are performed for solid hydrogen , and the performance of the analytical continuation is assessed by monitoring the density of states constructed directly and via the pad approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the difference between the * k*-integrated and * k*-resolved analytical continuations , as well as describing the use of random numbers and pole residues to analyze the approximant . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the analytic properties of the approximant can be controlled by appropriate modifications , making it a robust and reliable tool for electronic structure calculations . at the end , we propose a route to perform analytical continuation for the emto + dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) method . </S>"
