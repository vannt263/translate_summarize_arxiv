    "once the seds are built , it is possible to separate the radiation that is being emitted by the star from that re - emitted by the disk  the integration of the radiation emitted by the system at all wavelengths gives the bolometric brightness of the entire system .",
    "this is a direct integration up to 70 @xmath9 m .",
    "for longer wavelengths , an extrapolation is applied as suggested by @xcite , which assumes the hottest black body that fits the data at the longest available wavelength .",

    "similar methods for luminosity estimates are widely used in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath13 is subtracted from the emission of the entire system , the disk luminosity ( @xmath14 ) can be derived .",
    "these integrations take into consideration the distance to the star , besides the fluxes at different bands .",
    "the errors in the derivation of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are propagated from the errors in the distance , extinction ( @xmath15 2 mag ) and in the spectral type determination , and can be found in table [ 7tab1 ] .",
    "the stellar and fractional disk luminosities for the objects in taurus , upper scorpius and @xmath2 chamaeleontis were calculated in the exact same manner as for serpens .",
    "in their derivation of stellar luminosities for the serpens ysos with optical spectroscopy , @xcite adopted a distance to serpens of 259 @xmath15 37 pc ( @xcite , a discussion using @xmath5 = 193 @xmath15 13 pc of @xcite is included ) .",
    "however , since then the distance to the cloud has been revisited .",
    "@xcite find a distance of 415 @xmath15 15 pc to the serpens core from very long baseline array parallax observations of one star .",
    "this new distance is used in this work , which is also compatible with the _ chandra _ observations of the serpens core by @xcite .    the new stellar luminosities , derived for the distance of 415 pc , imply that the young stars in serpens move up in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath16 is determined from the object s spectral type as follows : for stars earlier than m0 the relationship of @xcite is used , while for stars of later spectral type that of @xcite is used .",
    "the errors in temperature are translated directly from the errors in spectral types . with @xmath13 and @xmath17 in hand",
    ", the objects can be placed in the hr diagram . for ysos",
    ", ages and masses can be derived by overlaying pre - main sequence ( pms ) evolutionary tracks on the hr diagram , and comparing the position of an object to the isochrones and mass tracks . due to the intrinsic physics and validation of parameters ,",
    "the models of @xcite are used for stars with masses smaller than 1.4 m@xmath0 , while more massive stars are compared to the models of @xcite .",
    "the new individual ages and masses are presented in table [ 7tab1 ] .",
    "figure [ 7f_age ] shows this updated distribution of masses and ages for the ysos in serpens .",
    "compared to the results of @xcite for @xmath5 = 259 pc , it is seen that the mass distribution does not change much , while the age distribution does .",
    "this is understood by looking at the isochrones and mass tracks of a given model ( e.g. figure 7 of @xcite ) : for the temperature range of the stars in serpens ( mostly k- and m - type ) , mass tracks are almost vertical .",
    "this means that a change in luminosity due to the new distance hardly affects the inferred mass . from the isochrones , however , it can be noted that in general higher stellar luminosities ( for this further distance ) imply younger ages . the median mass derived here",
    "is @xmath40.7 m@xmath0 and median age is @xmath42.3 myr , while @xcite found @xmath40.7 m@xmath0 and @xmath45 myr .",
    "as for most star - forming regions studied to date , a spread around the median age is seen for serpens , with a tail up to 10 myr .",
    "the spread , however , does not resemble a bimodal distribution of young stars as it is seen for orion , which has been found to be the consequence of the projection of another potentially unrelated foreground stellar population @xcite .",
    "since the quantity of data available for each object in this sample varies , not all seds produce good results or yield physical parameters .",
    "objects 31 , 62 , 80 , 81 , 86 and 103 are found to be much too luminous , which is not consistent with them being members of serpens .",
    "thus , they could not be placed in the hr diagram , and therefore no ages and masses could be determined . for objects 31 , 80 and 103",
    "the degeneracy between spectral type and extinction due to the lack of optical spectroscopy makes it difficult to establish good values for both parameters .",
    "confirmation of spectral types , better extinction determination , and the addition of optical photometry is necessary to revisit these objects and precisely determine their stellar parameters and whether they belong to the cloud or are contaminants .",
    "furthermore , objects 7 , 40 , 48 , 54 , 56 , 59 , 60 , 65 , 74 , 88 , 101 , 117 and 129 show flat seds .",
    "this produces large fractional disk luminosities that deserve attention .",
    "none of these objects show signs of being ( close to ) edge - on",
    ". edge - on systems will indeed produce high relative disk luminosities , but will also produce other signatures ( e.g. inability of fitting optical / near - ir photometry in its sed ; @xcite ) , which is not the case of any for the high luminosity disks shown here .",
    "most likely , those objects are in transition from stage i ( embedded ) to stage ii ( disks ) or surrounded by a nebulosity , leading to their classification as flat sources .    in the sed of object 64",
    "it can be seen that its photometry and irs spectra do not match .",
    "this could be due to ir variability ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the photometry was used for the luminosity derivation .",
    "lastly , object 41 seems to have a mismatch in the 2mass ( photometry ) making the results unreliable .",
    "for all these objects , the addition of more data , especially at longer wavelength , will help in understanding their nature and the derivation of accurate parameters .",
    "the serpens sample presented here is flux - limited and selected based on ir excess .",
    "that means that , by definition of the selection criteria , stars without disks and with disks fainter than 3 mjy at 8 @xmath9 m are not part of the sample .",
    "a conservative calculation of the fractional disk luminosity of the missed sources ( considering a flux lower than 3 mjy at 8 @xmath9 m ) was performed as described below .    due to the selection criteria , the disk population missed in serpens should be fainter than that presented here .",
    "@xcite identified a population of 235 ir - excess sources in serpens , called yso candidates .",
    "147 of the original sample were further studied with the irs spectrograph onboard _",
    ", comprising the sample presented here .",
    "this means that about 88 potential young stars with disks are missing . considering the @xmath420 % contamination fraction of background sources in the direction of serpens ( due to its low galactic latitude , @xcite ) , conservatively about 70 of these 88 objects could be young stars that were missed , which should populate the faint end of the @xmath18 distribution .",
    "the construction of the seds is one way to study the diversity of disks in the same region , most of which have ages with a narrow span around a few myr ( figure [ 7f_age ] ) .",
    "it is clear from the seds that different types of disks are present in serpens , some with substantial ir excess , others almost entirely dissipated .",
    "this is even more clear by looking at the distribution of fractional disk luminosities ( @xmath18 ) for this sample , which is presented in figure [ 7f_disk1 ] . here ,",
    "serpens ( solid black line ) is compared to taurus , equally young yet very different in terms of cloud structure and environment ( dotted red line ) .",
    "the peak and distribution of these two samples are very similar , with the bulk of each population showing fairly bright disks ( peak @xmath19 0.1 , median @xmath4 0.2 ) , the majority of which are consistent with passively irradiated disks ( @xmath20 0.2 , @xcite ) .",
    "this is in agreement with studies of disk geometry as inferred from ir colors , which show a large fraction of disks in young clusters to be flared ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ 7f_disk1 ] includes a correction for the possible missed sources discussed in  [ comp ] ( dashed black line ) , distributed in fractional disk luminosity bins according to their ir fluxes ( from @xcite ) .",
    "those could account for the difference between serpens and taurus in the faintest bin of @xmath21 in figure [ 7f_disk1 ] , but should not be able to shift the peak of the @xmath18 distribution for serpens .",
    "these findings support the idea that these two star - forming regions are similar in spite of their different environments and star formation rates , and that together they provide a good probe of the young bin of disk evolution .",

    "the dashed line in the serpens distribution accounts for completeness ( see text for details ) . an indicative boundary for self - luminous vs. passive disks is put at @xmath23 0.2",

    "these older regions are known to have lower disk fractions ( 40% for @xmath2 cha and 17% for up sco ; @xcite ) , meaning that most of the member stars have already fully dissipated their disks .",
    "figure [ 7f_disk1 ] clearly shows this difference in relation to the young serpens and taurus clouds , with distributions that peak ( and spread ) at considerably lower disk luminosities .",
    "the vertical dotted lines roughly separate luminosity ratios that can be explained by different mechanisms : self - luminous disks ( @xmath25 , @xcite ) and passive disks .",
    "this illustrative boundary was calculated by taking the maximum amount of light that a flared disk would be able to re - radiate by only reprocessing the stellar radiation .",
    "`` debris''-like disks are considerably fainter ( @xmath26 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the difference in observed fractional disk luminosities between the young serpens and taurus and the old upper sco and @xmath2 cha populations has implications on our understanding of disk evolution .",
    "figure [ 7f_disk1 ] shows an evolution in disk brightness that is concurrent with that of disk fraction @xcite . with time ,",
    "not only the fraction of stars that have disks diminishes , but the remaining disks tend to be fainter ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with models of disk evolution that include long - term dust growth and settling and predict disks to become flatter and fainter within a few million years ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , figure [ 7f_disk1 ] is consistent with the new younger age of serpens derived in  [ 7shrd ] , since the distribution in serpens is so similar to that in taurus and very different than those in upper sco and @xmath2 cha .",
    "figure [ 7f_disk2 ] shows an additional comparison of the disks in serpens with a sample of weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts , @xcite ) and a sample of debris disks around t tauri and herbig ae / be stars @xcite .",
    "the wtts sample consists of sources selected based on the original definition of weak h@xmath3 emission .",
    "this criterion also implies low accretion rates . in our samples ,",
    "objects are classified as accreting according to two prescriptions .",
    "the first method is based on the width at 10% of peak intensity of the h@xmath3 line ( from the relationship of @xcite ) where objects are classified as accreting if the width is greater than 270 km s@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the second method is based on the equivalent width of h@xmath3 and its spectral type , according to @xcite .",
    "@xcite present mass accretion rates based on the h@xmath3 data for the serpens sample , with the majority of objects fulfilling both criteria for classification as either accreting or non - accreting .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ 7f_disk2 ] that @xmath24 of the accreting ( ctts , solid black line ) and non - accreting ( wtts , dot - dashed line ) stars in serpens overlap with the wtts sample of @xcite ( dotted red line ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    within serpens , the accreting and non - accreting sub - samples overlap , differing slightly at the brighter end of the distribution , which is dominated by accreting objects .",
    "this is more clearly seen by looking at the median fractional disk luminosity @xmath28 which is 0.21 and 0.11 for accreting and non - accreting objects , respectively .",
    "the median fractional disk luminosity @xmath29 for the entire population of serpens is 0.20 . the few very bright ( self - luminous ) disks are actively accreting .",
    "these results confirm the finding by several authors that wtts may very well have massive disks not much different from those of ctts ( e.g. @xcite ) . at the other end , the faint tail of the cieza wtts population overlaps with the debris sample and should represent non - accreting stars surrounded by very flat optically thin disks .",
    "diskless wtts in serpens are not yet identified and therefore not shown in this plot .",
    "@xcite found that the disks around higher mass herbig ae / be stars can be divided into two groups , according to the disk geometry : group i comprises sources with considerable ir excess , associated with a flared geometry ; group ii consists of little ir excess , associated with a geometrically thin midplane , shadowed by the puffed - up disk inner rim .",
    "@xcite showed that the distributions of fractional disk luminosities for the two groups are different , with a mean @xmath18 of 0.52 for group i and 0.17 for group ii .",

    "although the mid - ir data for the cooler disks around t tauri stars probe a smaller portion of the disk compared to the more massive herbig ae / be counterparts @xcite , the fractional disk luminosities calculated here account for the bulk of the disk . a comparison between cooler ( t tauri ) and hotter ( herbig ae / be ) stars can inform about the universality of processes taking place in these disks , and whether they evolve in a similar manner despite the differences in masses and incident radiation field .",

    "the t tauri stars , on the other hand , span a much wider range of @xmath18 . the most striking difference between t tauri and herbig ae / be stars are both tails of the distribution .",
    "the lack of relatively very faint and very bright disks around herbig ae / be stars could be a bias effect due to the considerably lower number of disks observed compared to their lower mass counterparts .",
    "another possibility is that indeed disks around higher mass stars evolve faster , as suggested by previous studies @xcite .",
    "that would mean that the bright phase of disk evolution happens when the disks are still embedded in a spherical collapse envelope and consequently not visible , while the lack of the faint end of the distribution would imply a very fast evolution from flat disks to no disks at all , being only visible again in the debris stage .",
    "the latter finding is consistent with models of photoevaporation by high - energy photons @xcite . in those models ,",
    "photoevaporation becomes important once the viscous transport declines below a certain threshold , rendering a quick dispersion of the disk on a timescale that is a small fraction of its lifetime .",
    "it is predicted that more massive stars could lose their disks in @xmath410@xmath32 yr , which could explain the difference in the faint end of the distributions seen in figure [ 7f_disk3 ] .",
    "while the late - type ( k and m ) population of serpens spans a wide variety in disk shapes , the early - type ( a , f and g ) stars catch the attention .",
    "two of the 9 early - type stars ( # 52 and 114 ) are surrounded by so - called cold or transitional disks , i.e. disks depleted of warm dust close to the star but otherwise massive @xcite .",
    "the majority , however , show very little ir excess ( # 70 , 80 , 98 , 120 , 131 , 139 , and 145 ) consistent with a rapid transition from stage ii to iii . assuming that the stars in serpens are nearly coeval",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    no strong correlations are seen in either figures [ 7f_ls_min ] , [ 7f_ld_min ] or [ 7f_mac_min ] , pointing to no direct cause - effect relationships between either stellar , disk fractional luminosity or mass accretion rates and the dominant grain size or crystallinity fraction of the surface dust in a disk .",
    "similar results are found for the populations in taurus @xcite , tr 37 and ngc 7160 @xcite and cep ob2 @xcite for smaller samples , with different methods of analysis .",
    "this picture is unchanged by separating objects into 3 classes of disk geometry : flared ( @xmath36 ) , flat ( @xmath37 ) and cold or transitional disks ( @xmath38 , @xcite ) .",
    "distinct disk types show similar scatter .",
    "the results in figure [ 7f_ld_min ] for t tauri stars differ from those for herbig ae / be stars @xcite , which show a correlation between the mean grain size in the disk surface ( as derived from the silicate features ) and the geometry of the disk .",
    "their study of a small number of disks ( 14 objects ) argues that as the disk becomes flat ( transitioning from group i into group ii , and therefore decreasing @xmath18 , as they interpret ) , small dust grains are removed from the disk surface ( by coagulation into bigger grains or blown away by the stellar radiation or stellar winds ) , which yields larger dominating grain sizes for flatter disks .",
    "their results are supported by a less steep submilimeter slope for group ii sources than for group i. @xcite studied the milimeter slope of a sample of 26 herbig ae / be stars and found a correlation between this parameter and the geometry of the disk .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the milimeter data probe the dust population throughout the entire disk and do not say anything about the size of the dust in the disk surface , as is discussed here .",
    "@xcite suggest a geometry evolution from flared to self - shadowed with a concurrent evolution of the size of grains in the disk .",
    "similar results as those of @xcite are found for t tauri stars by @xcite , albeit for a very small number of objects ( 7 systems ) .",
    "@xcite also find a tentative correlation between submilimeter slope and grain size probed by the 10 @xmath9 m feature for a set of t tauri disks .",
    "those conclusions do not hold up for larger samples of disks around t tauri stars .",
    "in contrast , @xcite show for much larger samples of t tauri stars that the dust population in the disk surface is not the result of grain growth alone , but that also fragmentation of bigger grains enriches the population of small grain .",
    "this argument explains the presence of small grains in the surfaces of disks in all geometries ( and even debris disks ) and mean cluster ages .",
    "larger samples of herbig stars are needed to test whether this is also true for higher mass systems , or whether the concurrent dust and disk evolution is indeed mass dependent .",
    "in addition to stellar and disk fractional luminosities and mass accretion rate , other stellar and disk parameters ( such as stellar mass , disk colors and slopes ) were investigated in relation to the mineralogical results for the t tauri stars in our sample .",
    "similar to figures [ 7f_ls_min ] , [ 7f_ld_min ] and [ 7f_mac_min ] , no strong correlation was found for any combination of parameters .",
    "this lack of direct correlations between the stellar and disk characteristics presents itself as a strong argument for the non - direct relationship of stellar and disk characteristics , in the range of parameters ( time , mass , environment ) probed by the objects presented here . that is",
    ", no direct causal relationship between stellar and disk characteristics is seen for t tauri stars within a few myr ( @xmath41  10 myr ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that the physical correlations are washed away due to short timescale events .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned continuous balance between grain growth and destruction , episodic accretion events my play a role .",
    "an example is the case of the eruptive young star ex lupi , which showed an increase in crystallinity fraction with increase in stellar luminosity right after outburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that months after outburst the crystallinity fraction decreased from the post - outburst value .",
    "processes that are efficient on short timescales such as variability @xcite , vertical or radial mixing ( e.g. @xcite ) or dust crystallization / amorphization @xcite reconcile the notion that evolution of the dust takes place in disks but that no systematic evolution is detected in this work",
    ".    on the other hand , larger samples of sources that span a wider range in parameters could reveal relationships that are not found here .",
    "for instance , the dependence of disk dispersal timescale on stellar mass @xcite ) is reflected in our data .",
    "it will be interesting in the future to have a similar analysis as presented here ( for stellar and disk characteristics , plus dust mineralogy ) probing a wider range in stellar mass and in time , reaching the debris disk population .",
    "we have studied a flux - limited population of young stars still surrounded by disks in the serpens molecular cloud . aided by spectroscopic characterization of the central sources of star+disk systems combined with ir photometry , seds of the objects",
    "could be constructed .",
    "the seds of serpens show a considerable spread in ir excess .",
    "this implies the presence of disks with different geometries and in different stages of dissipation around stars that are nearly coeval , indicating that time is not the dominant parameter in the evolution of protoplanetary disks . the distribution of disk to star luminosity as a function of the stellar luminosity shows a trend in which lower mass stars have relatively brighter disks , consistent with other evidence in the literature that disks around lower mass stars have generally longer lifetimes or that disks around higher mass stars evolve faster .    adopting the new distance of 415 pc for serpens , higher stellar luminosities",
    "are found than previously inferred by @xcite .",
    "the higher luminosities , in turn , combined with pms evolutionary models , allude to a distribution of ages that is younger than that found by @xcite .",
    "the great majority of young stars in serpens are in the 1  3 myr range , with a median age of @xmath42.3 myr .",
    "this result supports the observational evidence that serpens joins the taurus molecular cloud in probing the young bin of disk evolution , in spite of the different environment and star formation rates .",
    "the distribution of fractional disk luminosity of the objects in serpens also closely resembles that in taurus , both of which are very different from those in the older regions upper scorpius and @xmath2 chamaeleontis , where most disks have already dissipated .",
    "furthermore , the majority of the serpens population is consistent with passively reprocessing disks .",
    "when comparing the actively accreting and non - accreting stars of serpens ( based on h@xmath3 data ) , the main difference is seen at the bright tail of the fractional disk luminosity , dominated by strongly accreting stars .",
    "the disks around t tauri stars in serpens are compared to those around herbig ae / be stars @xcite .",
    "herbig ae / be stars show a clear separation in fractional disk luminosity for different disk geometries ( flared versus flat ) but this difference is not apparent for t tauri stars .",
    "the disks around herbig ae / be stars present a very narrow range of @xmath18 , concentrated around the border between self - luminous and passively irradiated disks , while the disks around t tauri stars span a wider range of fractional disk luminosities .",
    "the absence of the tail distributions for herbig ae / be could be due a faster evolution of these disks , or a bias effect due to the smaller number of disks observed around those higher mass stars .",
    "the stellar and disk characteristics are combined with dust mineralogy results delivered for the same regions by @xcite . by combining all these data ,",
    "the effects of stellar and disk characteristics on the surface dust of disks are studied .",
    "no strong correlations are found , suggesting that the many processes taking place in disks somehow conspire in complicated ways that make it difficult to isolate the effect of each process / parameter individually .",
    "one possibility is that the processes that change the structure and size distribution of dust within disks are recurring and have short timescales , making it difficult to discern long timescale evolutionary effects .",

    "<S> in contrast , the distributions for the older upper scorpius and @xmath2 chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin lower luminosity disks ( @xmath1 0.02 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this evolution in fractional disk luminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions : with time disks become fainter and the disk fractions decrease . </S>",

    "<S> this result is consistent with previous suggestions of a faster evolution for disks around herbig ae / be stars . furthermore , the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk surface ( grain sizes , temperatures and crystallinity fractions , as derived from _ spitzer _ irs spectra ) do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics or mean cluster age in the 1  10 myr range probed here . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation for the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within disks have short timescales , happening repeatedly , making it difficult to distinguish long lasting evolutionary effects . </S>"
