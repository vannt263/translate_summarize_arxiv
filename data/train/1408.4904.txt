    "has been researched in the fields of linear optics experimentally by utilizing the spatial modes of photons carrying orbital angular momentum information  @xcite and of cavity quantum electrodynamics  ( qed ) theoretically through the unitary dynamics  @xcite .    as is well known to us , atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decay are two typical decoherence factors , which would decrease the feasibility of the unitary - dynamics - based scheme .",
    "the previous works show that dissipative schemes could use either cavity decay or spontaneous emission alone to prepare entanglement , but when one of the factors exerts positive effects on state preparation , the other is just opposite .",
    "thus , using both decoherence factors to prepare entanglement has unique characteristic .",
