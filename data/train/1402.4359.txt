    "such experimental data provide valuable information about elementary excitations , their mutual interaction , and many matrix elements .",
    "theoretically , it is well established that even complex quantum systems can be described at low energies by simpler effective models .",
    "such models can result for instance from various renormalization procedures @xcite .",
    "focusing on gapped systems , the elementary excitations can be viewed generically as quasi - particles the number of which is conserved which move and interact and determine the physical properties of the system under study .",

    "such approaches yield models in terms of the elementary excitations so that the dynamic response at zero temperature is captured and an enormous wealth of information is available . if such models conserve the number of quasi - particles , i.e. , the number of excitations , they are no longer plagued by quantum fluctuations : their ground state is the vacuum of the quasi - particles , cf",
    ".  ref .  .",
    "thus the only remaining fluctuations to worry about are thermal ones at finite temperature .",
    "we have two classes for physical realizations of such systems in mind .",
    "quantum antiferromagnets with a finite spin gap represent one wide class . in particular various antiferromagnets made from coupled spin dimers",
    "belong to this class , for instance , dimerized spin chains @xcite , spin ladders @xcite , two - dimensionally coupled spin ladders @xcite , and three - dimensionally coupled spin dimers @xcite .",
    "the elementary excitations are triplons , i.e. , @xmath0 hard - core bosons @xcite .",
    "the hard - core repulsion comes about because the presence of one excitation at a given site ( dimer ) excludes the presence of a second excitation at this site .",
    "another example of hard - core bosonic excitations are spin flips in the high - field phase of the transverse field ising model .",
    "they represent hard - core excitations of a single flavor @xcite .",
    "the other class are designed systems made from ultracold bosonic atoms trapped in suitable optical traps and lattices , for a review see ref .  .",
    "the setup of ultracold atoms has the advantage that their number is conserved by construction .",
    "a disadvantage with respect to the considerations presented here is that there is no scattering process which creates or annihilates an atom as does inelastic neutron scattering with magnetic triplons or magnons .    the models in terms of conserved hard - core bosons , i.e. , their number is a conserved quantity , are very successfully analyzed to extract information at zero temperature , i.e. , in the immediate vicinity of the ground state .",
    "but the models are also valid and useful at finite temperatures unless the temperature is so high that the system enters another phase .",
    "the overall goal of the present article is to benchmark a diagrammatic approach which allows one to include the thermal fluctuations in a strongly interacting model of hard - core bosons with the vacuum being the ground state , i.e. , no bosonic condensate is considered .",
    "the benchmarking is done for a simple gapped chain model in which only one kind of hard - core bosons hop from site to site .",
    "this model can be treated exactly by a jordan - wigner mapping to free fermions so that a reliable testbed is available .",
    "however , the simple model shares all the basic elements of more complicated hard - core boson models : mobile bosons with an infinite local repulsion whose number is conserved so that no quantum fluctuations occur .",
    "we stress that the one dimensional case serves only as a testbed to gauge our method while the approach is applicable also in higher dimensions and is not restricted to the one dimensional case . since only a limited toolset to calculate the finite temperature dynamics of quantum systems in higher dimensions is available , the diagrammatic approach is a promising new technique for a wide range of problems .    by the careful benchmark",
    ", we validate an approach which can be applied to all kinds of particle - conserving gapped models .",
    "such effective models are no longer subject to quantum fluctuations .",
    "they can be derived systematically by various techniques , in particular by continuous unitary transformations @xcite so that a large class of problems can be tackled in this way .",
    "wide - spread examples are the excitation line - shapes in gapped quantum antiferromagnets investigated by neutron scattering in one dimension @xcite as well as in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "so far the theoretical treatments of these experiments have focused on dispersion relations @xmath1 and their temperature dependent shifts , neglecting issues of line shape and width .",
    "we highlight the one - dimensional material @xmath2 $ ] which is strongly dimerized and exhibits a large gap - to - bandwith ratio so that a particle - conserving model free of quantum fluctuations is easily derivable @xcite .",
    "the diagrammatic approach to thermal fluctuations is systematically controlled by the expansion parameter @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the inverse temperature and @xmath5 the energy gap .",
    "we present the direct calculation of the leading order in @xmath3 of the self energy and the corresponding self - consistent calculation with dressed propagators .",
    "this approach is tested for a model for which numerically exact results are available for the propagators .",
    "we show by comparison of numerical data that both approaches agree in linear order in @xmath3 . in this comparison",
    "we focus on the position of the single - boson peak in the spectral response , its broadening and the symmetry of its shape .",
    "we show that while the single - boson peak broadens , the overall bandwidth of the dispersion tends to narrow upon increasing temperature .",
    "this behavior has been observed experimentally @xcite and it is at the focus of ongoing theoretical research @xcite .",
    "this underlines its importance . in view of the constantly improved instrumentation of inelastic neutron scattering setups a growing interest in reliable theoretical techniques for the thermal effects on line shapes is to be expected .",
    "we also evaluate the average occupation due to thermal excitations and find an excellent agreement between the self - consistent diagrammatic result and the exact one .    in view of these results ,",
    "the self - consistent diagrammatic approach suggests itself for application to more complicated , extended models for gapped quantum antiferromagnets _ after _ their re - formulation in terms of conserved quasi - particles to take the quantum fluctuations into account .",
    "extensions may comprise longer - range hoppings , further interactions among the hard - core excitations , and excitations of several flavors .",
    "also , the application in dimensions greater than one appears promising because one may generally expect that a diagrammatic perturbative approach works even better in higher dimensions .",
    "the present article is set up as follows : in the next section , the considered model is introduced .",

    "iii , we present the diagrammatic approach in detail ; a particular focus lies on the pure cosine band as it results from nearest - neighbor hopping . in sect .",

    "the ground state of the system is given by the vacuum state .",
    "in typical physical systems , such as spin ladders or spin chains , additional interactions , non - particle - conserving terms as well as longer range hopping are present .",
    "we do not consider these terms in our simple model , but we stress that there are a variety of methods to treat such terms which can be combined with our diagrammatic approach . for example , models with non - particle - conserving terms can be mapped to effective , particle - conserving models by continuous unitary transformations ( cut ) @xcite , while additional interactions , besides the hard - core constraint , can be dealt with on a mean - field level",
    ". longer range hopping processes trivially modify the dispersion .    to test our diagrammatic results , we make use of the fact that the hamiltonian can be mapped to a system of free fermions by the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite    [ eq.jordan_wigner ] @xmath16    the operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 fulfill fermionic anti - commutator relations . after a fourier transformation to reciprocal space ,",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath19 in contrast to free bosons , the spectral properties of hard - core bosons at finite temperature are not exactly known .",
    "even though the above fermionic approach can be applied , the calculation of dynamic susceptibilities remains a difficult task because of the non - locality of the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "one example is the single - particle temperature green function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the imaginary time and @xmath22 is the time - ordering super operator .",
    "the corresponding spectral function reads @xmath23 where we introduced the matsubara frequencies @xmath24 , the inverse temperature @xmath25 , and the total number of sites @xmath26 .",

    "for instance , it is accessible in inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "note that there are no contributions from anomalous green functions , @xmath28 since the hamiltonian is particle conserving .",

    "the opposite case at infinite temperatue is @xmath34 ; a site is occupied with probability @xmath35 and the spectral weight over all positive and negative frequencies adds up to zero .",
    "in this section we introduce the diagrammatic approach to treat the hard - core repulsion at finite temperatures .",
    "the key idea is an expansion in the small parameter @xmath3 . in subsection [ ssect : gen_calcul ]",
    "the single - particle self energy is calculated for arbitrary dispersion relation . in the following subsection [ ssect : cos - band ]",
    "we specialize our results to the pure cosine band and show for this special case , that the shift of the dispersion , due to the finite density of thermal fluctuations , is a second order effect in @xmath36 .",
    "our diagrammatic approach is based on the idea to replace the hard - core boson operators by pure bosonic operators and to enforce the hard - core constraint by an infinite on - site interaction , @xmath37 this idea has long been known under the name of brckner theory for nuclear matter and he@xmath38 @xcite . for low dimensional solid state systems such as spin ladders",
    "it was first proposed in ref .",
    "in contrast to that investigation , we are not dealing with quantum fluctuations but with thermal fluctuations , i.e. , the number of bosons is a constant of motion in our case . in the original approach",
    "anomalous green functions are present and it is difficult to determine which diagrams contribute in leading order in the density of quantum fluctuations . in our application ,",
    "no quantum fluctuations are present .",
    "the initial spin hamiltonian may contain non - particle - conserving terms , but we assume that they have been eliminated by some renormalizing procedure , for instance by unitary transformations . consequently , we assume that at zero temperature the propagation of the hard - core bosons is described exactly .    transforming the hamiltonian @xmath39 into reciprocal space yields @xmath40",
    "note that in higher dimensions the momenta @xmath41 are vectors .",
    "this does not change the subsequent theoretical calculations . in practice , the equations",
    "can then be solved using higher dimensional fast fourier techniques .",
    "we expand the single - particle propagator @xmath42 in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "since the interaction is infinite , a truncated perturbative approach in the interaction strength can not succeed .",
    "instead , we use the density of thermal excitations as small expansion parameter , i.e. , we expand in @xmath36 .",
    "the leading order is given by those diagrams that have the fewest number of propagators going backwards in imaginary time .",
    "thus , in linear order in @xmath36 , we have to sum all diagrams with a single loop which amounts to the summation of the ladder diagrams , see fig .  [ fig.ladder1 ] , following the arguments in refs .",
    "we treat the system as a dilute bose gas .",
    "note that the ladder approximation presented here differs from those in standard textbooks @xcite , where the leading _ quantum fluctuations _ are captured which result from the dominant interaction of the quasi - particles with the condensate .",
    "in contrast to this , our approach captures the leading effects on the spectral function due to the presence of a small density of thermally excited bosons . as a result",
    "our approximation breaks down once the density of thermally excited bosons is not small anymore .",
    "so the chosen approach represents a low - temperature approximation .",
    "]    the elementary building block in the ladder diagrams is the scattering amplitude @xmath43 , defined in fig .",
