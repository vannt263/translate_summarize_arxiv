    "a superintegrable system is said to be of order @xmath9 if @xmath9 is the maximal degree of the constants of motion @xmath10 , excluding the hamiltonian , in the momentum variables .",
    "the @xmath11 case is associated to symmetries of geometric nature and to lie algebras whereas the @xmath12 case is typically associated to multiseparability of the schrdinger equation and to quadratic invariance algebras .",
    "a substantial amount of work has been done on superintegrable systems , motivated in part by their numerous applications , exact solvability and connections with the theory of special functions . in view of these properties ,",
    "the search for new superintegrable models and their characterization is of significant interest in mathematical physics .",
    "for a recent review on superintegrable systems , one can consult @xcite .",
    "a series of novel superintegrable models in the plane with hamiltonians involving reflection operators have been introduced recently @xcite .",
    "the simplest of these systems , called the dunkl oscillator in the plane , is defined by the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath13+\\frac{1}{2}\\big[x_1 ^ 2+x_2 ^ 2\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 stands for the dunkl derivative @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 and where @xmath17 is the reflection operator with respect to the @xmath18 axis , i.e @xmath19 the hamiltonian can obviously be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , is the one - dimensional dunkl oscillator hamiltonian @xmath23 in @xcite , the hamiltonian was shown to be maximally superintegrable and its two independent constants of motion , obtained by the schwinger construction , were seen to generate a @xmath24 algebra extended with involutions .",
    "this algebra was called the schwinger - dunkl algebra @xmath25 .",
    "it was further shown that the schrdinger equation associated to admits separation of variables in both cartesian and polar coordinates and the separated wavefunctions were given explicitly .",
    "furthermore , the overlap coefficients between the separated wavefunctions were expressed in terms of the dual @xmath26 hahn polynomials through a correspondence with the clebsch - gordan problem of @xmath0 , a @xmath27 limit of the quantum algebra @xmath28 ( see section ii for the definition of @xmath0 and @xcite for background ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the representation theory of the schwinger - dunkl algebra @xmath25 was examined .",
    "the results obtained in this paper further strengthened the idea that dunkl oscillator models are showcases for @xmath26 orthogonal polynomials ( see @xcite ) .",
    "generalizations of the dunkl oscillator in the plane were considered in @xcite , where the singular and the @xmath29 anisotropic dunkl oscillators were investigated .",
    "the two systems were shown to be superintegrable , their constants of motion were constructed and their ( quadratic ) invariance algebra was given .",
    "it was also shown that in some cases these models exhibit multiseparability . here",
    "we pursue our investigations on dunkl oscillator models by considering the three - dimensional version of the system in euclidean space .",
    "the dunkl oscillator in three - dimensional euclidean space is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath30+\\frac{1}{2}\\big[x_1 ^ 2+x_2 ^ 2+x_3 ^ 2\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the dunkl derivative given by .",
    "an elementary calculation shows that the square of the dunkl derivative has the expression @xmath32 as is directly seen , the hamiltonian corresponds to the combination of three independent ( commuting ) one - dimensional dunkl oscillators with hamiltonians @xmath21 given by .",
    "it directly follows from the formulas and that when @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the dunkl oscillator hamiltonian reduces to that of the standard isotropic harmonic oscillator in three dimensions .",
    "we note that the term `` isotropic '' here refers to the fact that the three independent one - dimensional oscillator entering the total hamiltonian have the same frequency . to obtain a 3d dunkl oscillator isotropic in the sense of being @xmath35-invariant",
    ", one must also take @xmath36 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the @xmath0 dynamical symmetry and the schwinger construction are used to obtain the symmetries of the total hamiltonian , thus establishing its superintegrability .",

    "a short conclusion follows .",
    "in this section , the @xmath0 dynamical algebra of the three - dimensional dunkl oscillator is made explicit and is exploited to obtain the spectrum of the hamiltonian . following the schwinger construction , the constants of motion are constructed using the raising / lowering operators of the @xmath0 algebra of the one - dimensional constituents .",
    "the schwinger - dunkl algebra @xmath2 formed by the symmetries is seen to correspond to a deformation of the lie algebra @xmath1 by involutions and the defining relations of @xmath2 are given in two different bases .",
