    "it seems likely that gravity is not given by the einstein action , at least at sufficiently high energy scales .",
    "the most promising alternative seems to be that offered by string theory , where the gravity becomes scalar - tensor in nature . in the low energy limit of the string theory ,",
    "one recovers einstein gravity along with a scalar dilaton field which is non - minimally coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "when a dilaton is coupled to einstein - maxwell theory , it has profound consequences for the black hole solutions .",
    "this fact may be seen in the case of rotating einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) black holes of kaluza - klein theory with coupling constant @xmath3 which does not possess the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath4 of kerr - newman black hole @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worth to find exact solutions of emd gravity for an arbitrary coupling constant , and investigate how the properties of black holes / branes are modified when a dilaton is present .",
    "also it is interesting to investigate the thermal stability of black holes / branes in the presence of dilaton , and find out the effect of dilaton in the stability of the solutions .",
    "exact charged dilaton black hole solutions of emd gravity in the absence of a dilaton potential have been constructed by many authors @xcite .",
    "the dilaton changes the casual structure of the spacetime and leads to curvature singularities at finite radii .",
    "these black holes are asymptotically flat . in recent years ,",
    "non - asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes are attracting much interest in connection with the so called ads / cft correspondence .",
    "black hole spacetimes which are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti)-de sitter [ ( a)ds ] have been found and investigated by many authors .",
    "the uncharged solutions have been found in @xcite , while the charged solutions have been considered in @xcite . in the presence of liouville - type potential , static charged black hole solutions have been discovered with positive , zero or negative constant curvature horizons @xcite .",
    "recently , the properties of these black hole solutions which are not asymptotically ads or ds , have been studied @xcite .",
    "these exact solutions are all static .",
    "charged rotating dilaton black holes with curved horizon have not been constructed in four or higher dimensions for an arbitrary coupling constant and arbitrary rotation parameter .",
    "indeed , exact magnetic rotating solutions have been considered in three dimensions @xcite , while exact rotating black hole solutions in four dimensions have been obtained only for some limited values of the coupling constant @xcite . for general dilaton coupling ,",
    "the properties of rotating charged dilaton black holes only with infinitesimally small charge @xcite or small angular momentum in four @xcite and five @xcite dimensions have been investigated . for arbitrary values of angular momentum and",

    "recently , two classes of magnetic rotating solutions in four - dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity with liouville - type potential have been constructed by one of us @xcite . although these solutions are not black holes and represent spacetimes with conic singularities , charged black string solutions in four - dimensional emd gravity have also been constructed @xcite . till now ,",
    "exact rotating charged dilaton black hole / brane solutions for an arbitrary coupling constant in more than four dimensions have not been constructed .",
    "our aim in this paper is to construct exact , rotating charged dilaton black brane in @xmath5 dimensions for an arbitrary value of coupling constant and investigate their properties .",
    "specially , we want to perform a stability analysis and investigate the effect of dilaton on the stability of the solutions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ field ] is devoted to a brief review of the field equations and general formalism of calculating the conserved quantities . in sec .",
    "[ charged ] , we construct the @xmath0-dimensional charged rotating dilaton black branes with a complete set of rotation parameters and investigate their properties . in sec .",
    "[ therm ] , we obtain the conserved and thermodynamical quantities of the @xmath0-dimensional black brane solutions and show that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics . in sec .",
    "[ stab ] , we perform a stability analysis and show that the dilaton creates an unstable phase for the solutions .",
    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the action of @xmath0-dimensional dilaton einstein - maxwell gravity with one scalar field can be written as @xcite@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ricci scalar curvature , @xmath8 is the dilaton field and @xmath9 is a potential for @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath10 is a constant determining the strength of coupling of the scalar and electromagnetic field , @xmath11 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath12 is the electromagnetic potential .",
    "the last term in eq . ( [ act ] ) is the gibbons - hawking boundary term which is chosen such that the variational principle is well - defined .",
    "the manifold @xmath13 has metric @xmath14 and covariant derivative @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath17 of any boundary(ies ) @xmath18 of the manifold @xmath19 , with induced metric(s ) @xmath20 . in this paper",
    ", we consider the action ( [ act ] ) with a liouville type potential , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant which may be referred to as the cosmological constant , since in the absence of the dilaton field ( @xmath23 ) the action ( [ act ] ) reduces to the action of einstein - maxwell gravity with cosmological constant .",
    "the equations of motion can be obtained by varying the action ( [ act ] ) with respect to the gravitational field @xmath14 , the dilaton field @xmath8 and the gauge field @xmath12 which yields the following field equations @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 the conserved charges of the spacetime can be calculated through the use of the substraction method of brown and york @xcite .",
    "such a procedure causes the resulting physical quantities to depend on the choice of reference background . for asymptotically ( a)ds solutions , the way that one deals with these divergences is through the use of counterterm method inspired by ( a)ds / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of a non - trivial dilaton field , the spacetime may not behave as either ds ( @xmath27 ) or ads ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that with the exception of a pure cosmological constant potential , where @xmath29 , no ads or ds static spherically symmetric solution exist for liouville - type potential @xcite .",
    "but , as in the case of asymptotically ads spacetimes , according to the domain - wall / qft ( quantum field theory ) correspondence @xcite , there may be a suitable counterterm for the stress energy tensor which removes the divergences . in this paper",
    ", we deal with the spacetimes with zero curvature boundary [ @xmath30 , and therefore the counterterm for the stress energy tensor should be proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the finite stress - energy tensor in @xmath0-dimensional einstein - dilaton gravity with liouville - type potential may be written as @xmath32 ,   \\label{stres}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 in the particular case @xmath29 , the effective @xmath35 of eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) reduces to @xmath36 of the ads spacetimes .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ stres ] ) is the variation of the action ( [ act ] ) with respect to @xmath20 , and the last term is the counterterm which removes the divergences .",
    "one may note that the counterterm has the same form as in the case of asymptotically ads solutions with zero curvature boundary , where @xmath37 is replaced by @xmath33 . to compute the conserved charges of the spacetime",
    ", one should choose a spacelike surface @xmath38 in @xmath18 with metric @xmath39 , and write the boundary metric in adm ( arnowitt - deser - misner ) form : @xmath40 where the coordinates @xmath41 are the angular variables parameterizing the hypersurface of constant @xmath42 around the origin , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the lapse and shift functions respectively .",
    "when there is a killing vector field @xmath45 on the boundary , then the quasilocal conserved quantities associated with the stress tensors of eq .",
    "( [ stres ] ) can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the determinant of the metric @xmath39 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the killing vector field and the unit normal vector on the boundary @xmath50 .",
    "for boundaries with timelike ( @xmath51 ) and rotational ( @xmath52 ) killing vector fields , one obtains the quasilocal mass and angular momentum @xmath53 provided the surface @xmath50 contains the orbits of @xmath54 .",
    "these quantities are , respectively , the conserved mass and angular momenta of the system enclosed by the boundary @xmath50 . note that they will both depend on the location of the boundary @xmath50 in the spacetime , although each is independent of the particular choice of foliation @xmath55 within the surface @xmath18 .",
    "[ field]our aim here is to construct the @xmath0-dimensional rotating solutions of the field equations ( [ fe1])-([fe3 ] ) with @xmath56 rotation parameters and investigate their properties . the rotation group in @xmath0-dimensions is @xmath57 and therefore the number of independent rotation parameters for a localized object is equal to the number of casimir operators , which is @xmath58\\equiv k$ ] , where @xmath59 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath60 .",
    "the metric of @xmath0-dimensional rotating solution with cylindrical or toroidal horizons and @xmath56 rotation parameters can be written as @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 s are @xmath56 rotation parameters .",
    "the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 should be determined and @xmath37 has the dimension of length which is related to the cosmological constant @xmath22 for the case of liouville - type potential with constant @xmath8 .",

    "@xmath71 , we make the ansatz @xmath72 using ( [ rphi ] ) , the maxwell fields ( [ ftr ] ) and the metric ( [ met3 ] ) , one can easily show that equations ( [ fe1 ] ) and ( [ fe2 ] ) have solutions of the form @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are arbitrary constants and @xmath77 .",
    "one may note that in the particular case @xmath78 these solutions reduce to the four - dimensional charged rotating dilaton black strings presented in @xcite . in the absence of a non - trivial dilaton ( @xmath79 ) , the above solutions reduce to the asymptotically ads charged rotating black branes presented in @xcite .      in order to study the general structure of these solutions ,",
    "we first look for the curvature singularities in the presence of dilaton gravity .",
    "it is easy to show that the kretschmann scalar @xmath80 diverges at @xmath81 , it is finite for @xmath82 and goes to zero as @xmath83 .",
    "thus , there is an essential singularity located at @xmath81 . also , it is notable to mention that the ricci scaler is finite every where except at @xmath81 , and goes to zero as @xmath83 .",
    "the spacetime is neither asymptotically flat nor ( a)ds . as in the case of rotating black hole solutions of the einstein gravity , the above metric given by ( [ met3 ] ) and ( [ f ] ) has both killing and event horizons .",
    "the killing horizon is a null surface whose null generators are tangent to a killing field .",
    "it is easy to see that the killing vector @xmath84 is the null generator of the event horizon , where @xmath56 denote the number of rotation parameters @xcite . as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) , the solution is ill - defined for @xmath85 with a liouville potential ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the cases with @xmath87 and @xmath88 should be considered separately .    in the first case where @xmath87 , as @xmath42 goes to infinity the dominant term is the second term , and therefore the spacetime has a cosmological horizon for positive values of the mass parameter , despite the sign of the cosmological constant @xmath22 . in the second case",
    "where @xmath89 , as @xmath42 goes to infinity the dominant term is the first term , and therefore there exist a cosmological horizon for @xmath90 , while there is no cosmological horizons if @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , in the latter case ( @xmath91 and @xmath28 ) the spacetimes associated with the solution ( [ f ] ) exhibit a variety of possible casual structures depending on the values of the metric parameters @xmath10 , @xmath76 , @xmath70 , and @xmath92 .",
    "one can obtain the casual structure by finding the roots of @xmath93 .",
    "unfortunately , because of the nature of the exponents in ( [ f ] ) , it is not possible to find explicitly the location of horizons for an arbitrary value of @xmath10 .",
    "but , we can obtain some information by considering the temperature of the horizons .",
    "one can obtain the temperature and angular velocity of the horizon by analytic continuation of the metric .",
    "the analytical continuation of the lorentzian metric by @xmath94 and @xmath95 yields the euclidean section , whose regularity at @xmath96 requires that we should identify @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 s are the inverse hawking temperature and the @xmath101th component of angular velocity of the horizon .",
    "it is a matter of calculation to show that @xmath102 equation ( [ tem ] ) shows that the temperature is negative for the two cases of ( _ i _ )",
    "@xmath87 despite the sign of @xmath22 , and ( _ ii _ ) positive @xmath22 despite the value of @xmath10 . as we argued above in these two cases we encounter with cosmological horizons , and therefore the cosmological horizons have negative temperature .",
    "numerical calculations show that the temperature of the event horizon goes to zero as the black brane approaches the extreme case .",
    "thus , one can see from eq .",
    "( [ tem ] ) that there exists extreme black brane only for negative @xmath22 and @xmath91 , if @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the extremal mass parameter of black brane .",
    "if one substitutes this @xmath105 into the equation @xmath106 , then one obtains the condition for extreme black brane as : @xmath107 indeed , the metric of eqs .",
    "( [ met3 ] ) and ( [ f ] ) has two inner and outer horizons located at @xmath108 and @xmath109 , provided the mass parameter @xmath110 is greater than @xmath104 , an extreme black brane in the case of @xmath111 , and a naked singularity if @xmath112 .",
    "note that for @xmath78 , eq .",
    "( [ mext ] ) reduces to the extremal mass obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the absence of dilaton field ( @xmath113 ) it reduces to that obtained in @xcite .",
    "denoting the volume of the hypersurface boundary at constant @xmath114 and @xmath42 by @xmath115 , the mass and angular momentum per unit volume @xmath116 of the black branes ( @xmath91 ) can be calculated through the use of eqs .",
    "( [ mastot ] ) and ( [ angtot ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath117 @xmath118 for @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , the angular momentum per unit volume vanishes , and therefore @xmath62 s are the rotational parameters of the spacetime .",
    "black hole entropy typically satisfies the so called area law of the entropy @xcite .",
    "this near universal law applies to almost all kinds of black holes and black branes in einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "it is a matter of calculation to show that the entropy per unit volume @xmath116 of the black brane is @xmath121 which shows that the area law holds for the black brane solutions in dilaton gravity .",
    "next , we calculate the electric charge of the solutions . to determine the electric field we should consider the projections of the electromagnetic field tensor on special hypersurfaces .",
    "the normal to such hypersurfaces is @xmath122 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the lapse function and shift vector .",
    "then the electric field is @xmath123 , and the electric charge per unit volume @xmath116 can be found by calculating the flux of the electric field at infinity , yielding @xmath124 the electric potential @xmath125 , measured at infinity with respect to the horizon , is defined by @xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the null generators of the event horizon given by eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) .",
    "one can easily show that the vector potential @xmath12 corresponding to the electromagnetic tensor ( [ ftr ] ) can be written as @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the electric potential may be obtained as @xmath130 then , we consider the first law of thermodynamics for the black brane . in order to do this ,",
    "we obtain the mass @xmath131 as a function of extensive quantities @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 . using the expression for the mass , the angular momenta , the entropy and the charge given in eqs .",
    "( [ m])-([chden ] ) and the fact that @xmath135 , one can obtain a smarr- type formula as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the positive real root of the following equation : @xmath138 one may then regard the parameters @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 as a complete set of extensive parameters for the mass @xmath139 and define the intensive parameters conjugate to @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "these quantities are the temperature , the angular velocities and the electric potential @xmath140 numerical calculations show that the intensive quantities calculated by eq .",
    "( [ inte ] ) coincide with eqs .",
    "( [ tem ] ) , ( [ om1 ] ) and ( [ pott ] ) .",
    "thus , these thermodynamics quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics @xmath141",
    "finally , we investigate the stability of charged rotating black brane solutions in dilaton gravity .",
    "the stability of a thermodynamic system with respect to small variations of the thermodynamic coordinates is usually performed by analyzing the behavior of the entropy @xmath142 around the equilibrium .",
    "the local stability in any ensemble requires that @xmath142 be a convex function of the extensive variables or its legendre transformation must be a concave function of the intensive variables .",
    "the stability can also be studied by the behavior of the energy @xmath143 which should be a convex function of its extensive variable .",
    "thus , the local stability can in principle be carried out by finding the determinant of the hessian matrix of @xmath144 with respect to its extensive variables @xmath145 , @xmath146 $ ] @xcite . in our case",
    "the mass @xmath131 is a function of entropy , angular momenta , and charge .",
    "the number of thermodynamic variables depends on the ensemble that is used . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "the charge and the angular momenta are fixed parameters , and therefore the positivity of the @xmath147 is sufficient to ensure local stability .",
    "numerical calculations show that the black brane solutions are stable independent of the value of the charge parameter @xmath70 in any dimensions if @xmath148 .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the behavior of the @xmath149  as a function of the coupling constant parameter @xmath10 for different value of charge parameters @xmath70 .",
    "it shows that if the dilaton coupling constant is greater than one ( @xmath150 ) , then there exists a maximum value of @xmath151 for which @xmath149 is negative provided @xmath152 and positive otherwise . that is the black brane solutions are unstable for large values of @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth to note that @xmath153 depends on the charge parameter @xmath70 and the dimensionality of space time ( see figs .",
    "[ figure1]-[figure3 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ figure4 ] shows the behavior of the @xmath149 as a function of the charge parameter @xmath70 for different value of coupling constant parameter @xmath10 .",
    "it shows that for a fixed value of @xmath10 there is a lower limit for charge parameter @xmath70 , for which our solutions are only stable if @xmath154 . in other words",
    ", they show that electric charge makes the black brane stable for @xmath155 .",
    "this fact is the same as the case of reissner - nordstrm black hole , in which charge makes it stable .",
    "again , in general @xmath156 depends on the dimensionality of space time for a fixed value of @xmath10 , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] .",
    "unfortunately , exact rotating solutions of the einstein equation coupled to matter fields are difficult to find except in a limited number of cases .",
    "indeed , no explicit rotating charged black hole solutions with curved horizon have been found except for some dilaton couplings such as @xmath157 @xcite or @xmath158 when the string three - form @xmath159 is included @xcite . for general dilaton coupling , the properties of charged dilaton black holes have been investigated only for rotating solutions with infinitesimally small angular momentum @xcite or small charge @xcite .",
    "recently , charged rotating black string solution with flat horizon has been constructed in four dimensions .",
    "till now , exact rotating charged dilaton black brane solutions for an arbitrary coupling constant in more than four dimensions has not been constructed . in this paper , we obtained a class of @xmath5-dimensional charged rotating dilaton black brane solutions with liouville - type potentials .",
    "we found that these solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor ( a)ds . in the presence of liouville - type potential , we obtained exact solutions provided @xmath160 .",
    "for @xmath29 , these solutions reduce to the charged rotating black brane solutions of @xcite , while for @xmath78 , these solutions reduce to the four - dimensional charged rotating dilaton black string presented in @xcite .",
    "we found that these solutions have a cosmological horizon for ( _ i _ ) @xmath87 despite the sign of @xmath22 , and ( _ ii _ ) positive values of @xmath22 , despite the magnitude of @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath89 , the solutions present black branes with outer and inner horizons if @xmath161 , an extreme black hole if @xmath162 , and a naked singularity if @xmath112 . the hawking temperature of all the above horizons were computed .",
    "we found that the hawking temperature is negative for inner and cosmological horizons , and it is positive for outer horizons .",
    "we also computed the conserved and thermodynamics quantities of the @xmath0-dimensional rotating charged black brane , and found that they satisfy the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we also performed a stability analysis in canonical ensemble by considering @xmath163 for the charged rotating black brane solutions in @xmath0 dimensions and showed that there is no hawking - page phase transition in spite of charge and angular momentum of the branes for @xmath148 , while the solutions have an unstable phase for large values of @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , for fixed values of the metric parameters , we found that there exists a maximum value of @xmath150 for which the solutions are unstable if @xmath164 , where @xmath153 depends on the dimensionality of the spacetime and the metric parameters @xmath76 and @xmath70 .",
    "this phase behavior shows that although there is no hawking - page transition for black object whose horizon is diffeomorphic to @xmath165 for @xmath148 and therefore the system is always in the high temperature phase @xcite , but in the presence of dilaton with @xmath150 the black brane solutions have some unstable phases .",
    "note that the @xmath0-dimensional charged rotating solutions obtained here have flat horizons .",
    "thus , it would be interesting if one can construct charged rotating solutions in @xmath0 dimensions in the presence of dilaton and electromagnetic fields with curved horizons .",

    "<S> we construct a class of charged , rotating solutions of @xmath0-dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity with liouville - type potentials and investigate their properties . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti)-de sitter . we find that these solutions can represent black brane , with two inner and outer event horizons , an extreme black brane or a naked singularity provided the parameters of the solutions are chosen suitably . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute temperature , entropy , charge , electric potential , mass and angular momentum of the black brane solutions , and find that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find a smarr - type formula and perform a stability analysis by computing the heat capacity in the canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the system is thermally stable for @xmath1 , while for @xmath2 the system has an unstable phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is incommensurate with the fact that there is no hawking - page phase transition for black objects with zero curvature horizon . </S>"
