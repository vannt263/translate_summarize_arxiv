    "the growth of dust particles by aggregation stands at the beginning of planet formation . whether planetesimals form by incremental aggregation , or through gravitational instabilities in a dusty sublayer",
    ", particles have to grow and settle to the midplane regardless . on the most basic level ,",
    "the physics of such growth is simple : particles collide because relative velocities are induced by random and ( size - dependent ) systematic motions of grains and aggregates in the gaseous nebula surrounding a forming star .",
    "the details are , however , highly complex .",
    "the physical state of the disk , in particular the presence or absence of turbulent motions , set the boundary conditions .",
    "when particles collide with low velocities , they stick by mutual attractive forces , be it simple van der waals attraction or stronger forces ( molecular dipole interaction in polar ices , or grain - scale long - range forces due to charges or magnetic fields ) .",
    "while the lowest velocities create particle shapes governed by the motions alone , larger velocities contribute to shaping the aggregates by restructuring and destruction .",
    "the ability to internally dissipate energy is critical in the growth through intermediate pebble and boulder sizes . in this review",
    "we will concentrate on the physical properties and growth characteristics of these small and intermediate sizes , but also make some comments on the formation of planetesimals .",
    "relative velocities between grains in a protoplanetary disk can be caused by a variety of processes .",
    "for the smallest grains , these are dominated by brownian motions , that provide relative velocities in the mm / s to cm / s range for ( sub)micron sized grains .",
    "larger grains show systematic velocities in the nebula because they decouple from the gas , settle vertically , and drift radially . at 1au in a solar nebula ,",
    "these settling velocities reach m / s for cm - sized grains .",
    "radial drift becomes important for even larger particles and reaches 10 s of m / s for m - sized bodies .",
    "finally , turbulent gas motions can induce relative motions between particles .",

    "the timescales of growth processes and the density and strength of aggregates formed by them , will depend on the structure of the aggregates",
    ". a factor of overriding importance for dust  gas interactions ( and therefore for the timescales and physics of aggregation ) , for the stability of aggregates , and for optical properties alike is the structure of aggregates as they form through the different processes .    the interaction of particles with the nebula gas is determined primarily by their gas drag stopping time @xmath0 which is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of a particle , @xmath3 its velocity relative to the gas , @xmath4 the average projected surface area , @xmath5 is the gas density , @xmath6 is the sound speed , and @xmath7 is the drag force .",
    "the second equal sign in eq.([eq:3 ] ) holds under the assumption that particles move at sub - sonic velocities and that the mean free path of a gas molecule is large compared to the size of the particle ( epstein regime ) . in this case , the stopping time is proportional to the ratio of mass and cross section of the particle . for spherical non - fractal",
    "( i.e. compact or porous ) particles of radius @xmath8 and mass density @xmath9 , this can be written as @xmath10 .",
    "fractal particles are characterized by the fact that the average density of a particle depends on size in a powerlaw fashion , with a power ( the fractal dimension @xmath11 ) smaller than 3 .",
    "@xmath12 for large aggregates , this value can in principle be measured for individual particles . for small particles",
    ", it is often more convenient to measure it using sizes and masses of a distribution of particles .",
    "fractal particles generally have large surface - to - mass ratios ; in the limiting case of long linear chains ( @xmath13 ) of grains with radii @xmath14 , @xmath15 approaches the constant value @xmath16 .",
    "this value differs from the value for a single grain @xmath17 by just a factor @xmath18 .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] shows how the cross section of particles varies with their mass for different fractal dimensions .",
    "it shows that for aggregates made of 10000 monomers , the surface - to - mass ratio can easily differ by a factor of 10 .",
    "an aggregate made from 0.1 particles with a mass equivalent to a 10 particle consists of 10@xmath19 monomers and the stopping time could vary by a factor of order 100 .",
    "just how far the fractal growth of aggregates proceeds is really not yet known .",
    "this review is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : dust - aggr - exper ] we cover the experiments and theory describing the basic growth processes of dust aggregates . in section  [ sec : part - gas - inter ] we discuss particle - gas interactions and the implications for inter - particle collision velocities as well as planetesimal formation . in section  [ sec : global - disk - models ] we describe recent advances in the modeling of dust aggregation in protoplanetary disks and observable consequences .",

    "this attractive force results in an elastic deformation leading to a flattening of the grains in the contact region .",
    "an equilibrium is reached when the attractive force equals the elastic repulsion force . for small , hard grains with low surface forces",

    "possibly the most important parameter influencing the structure of aggregates resulting from low velocity collisions is the resistance to rolling motion .",
    "if this resistance is very strong , both aggregate compaction and internal energy dissipation in aggregates would be very difficult .",
    "resistance to rolling first of all depends strongly on the geometry of the grains .",
    "if grains contain extended flat surfaces , contact made on such locations could not be moved by rolling - any attempt to roll them would inevitably lead to breaking the contact . in the contact between round surfaces , resistance",
    "to rolling must come from an asymmetric distribution of the stresses in the contact area . without external forces ,",
    "the net torque exerted on the grains should be zero .",
    "_ dominik and tielens _ ( 1995 ) showed that the pressure distribution becomes asymmetric , when the contact area is slightly shifted with respect to the axis connecting the curvature centers of the surfaces in contact .",
    "the resulting torque is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the equilibrium contact radius , @xmath30 the actual contact radius due to pressure in the vertical direction , and @xmath31 is the displacement of the contact area due to the torque . in this picture ,",
    "energy dissipation , and therefore friction , occurs when the contact area suddenly readjusts after it has been displaced because of external forces acting on the grains .",

    "with respect to this , it is important to know how dust evolution changes the morphology of a particle . as seen above , in most cases",

    "the experiments described above indicate that at velocities above approximately 1 m/s , collisions turns from sticking to bouncing , at least for oblique impacts . at higher velocities",

    "_ , 1993 ) random velocities are not damped on a collapse timescale , so incipient instabilities merely `` bounce '' and tidally diverge .",

    "for very small particles ( @xmath164 1 mm ; the highly relevant chondrule size ) , a different type of instability comes into play because the particles are firmly trapped to the gas by their short stopping times , and the combined system forms a single `` one - phase '' fluid which is stabilized against producing turbulence by its vertical density gradient ( _ sekiya _ , 1998 ; _ youdin and shu _ , 2002 ; _ youdin and chiang _ , 2004 ; _ garaud and lin _ , 2004 ) . even for midplane layers of such small particles to _ approach _ a suitable density for this to occur requires nebula turbulence to drop to what may be implausibly low values ( @xmath165 to @xmath166 ) .",
    "moreover , such one - phase layers , with particle stopping times @xmath0 much less than the dynamical collapse time @xmath167 , can not become `` unstable '' and collapse on the dynamical timescale as normally envisioned , because of _ gas _ pressure support , which is usually ignored ( _ sekiya _ , 1983 ; _ safronov _ , 1991 ) .",

    "while especially difficult on one - phase instabilities by definition , this obstacle should be considered for any particle with stopping time much shorter than the dynamical collapse time - that is , pretty much anything smaller than a meter for @xmath163 .",
    "a slower `` sedimentation '' from axisymmetric rings ( or even localized blobs of high density , which might form through fragmentation of such dense , differentially rotating rings ) , has also been proposed to occur under conditions normally ascribed to marginal gravitational instability ( _ sekiya _ , 1983 ; _ safronov _ , 1991 ; _ ward _ , 2000 ) , but this effect has only been modeled under nonturbulent conditions where , as mentioned above , growth can be quite fast by sticking alone . in a turbulent nebula , diffusion ( or other complications discussed below , such as large vortices , spiral density waves , etc )",

    ", planetesimal formation could merely await cessation of nebula turbulence and then happen all at once ; pros and cons of this simple concept are discussed by _ cuzzi and weidenschilling _",
    "the main difficulty with this concept is the very robust nature of growth in dense midplane layers of nonturbulent nebulae , compared to the very extended duration of @xmath171 years which apparently characterized meteorite parent body formation ( chapter by _ wadhwa et al . _ ) .",
    "furthermore , if turbulence merely ceased at the appropriate time for parent body formation to begin , particles of all sizes would settle and accrete together , leaving unexplained the very well characterized chondrite size distributions we observe .",
    "alternately , several suggestions have been advanced as to how the meter - sized barrier might be overcome even in ongoing turbulence , as described below .",
    "the speedy inward radial drift of meter - sized particles in nebulae where settling is precluded by turbulence might be slowed if they can be , even temporarily , trapped by one of several possible fluid dynamical effects .",
    "it has been proposed that such trapping concentrates them and leads to planetesimal growth as well .",
    "large nebula gas dynamical structures such as systematically rotating vortices ( not true turbulent eddies ) have the property of concentrating large boulders near their centers ( _ barge and sommeria _ , 1995 ; _ tanga et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; _ bracco et al . _ , 1998 ; _ godon and livio _ , 2000 ; _ klahr and bodenheimer _ , 2006 ) . in some of these models the vortices",
    "are simply prescribed and/or there is no feedback from the particles .",
    "moreover , there are strong vertical velocities present in realistic vortices , and the vortical flows which concentrate m - size particles are not found near the midplane , where the m - sized particles reside ( _ barranco and marcus _ , 2005 ) .",
    "finally , there may be a tendency of particle concentrations formed in modeled vortices to drift out of them and/or destroy the vortex ( _ johansen et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) .",
    "another possibility of interest is the buildup of solids near the peaks of nearly axisymmetric , localized radial pressure maxima , which might for instance be associated with spiral density waves ( _ haghighipour and boss _ ,",
    "2003a , b ; _ rice et al . _ , 2004 ) . _ johansen et al . _",
    "( 2006 ) noted boulder concentration in radial high pressure zones of their full simulation , but ( in contrast to above suggestions about vortices ) , saw no concentration of meter - sized particles in the closest thing they could resolve in the nature of actual turbulent eddies .",
    "perhaps this merely highlights the key difference between systematically rotating ( and often artificially imposed ) vortical fluid structures , and realistic eddies in realistic turbulence .",
    "overall , models of boulder concentration in large - scale fluid structures will need to assess the tendency for rapidly colliding meter - sized particles in such regions to destroy each other , in the real turbulence which will surely accompany such structures .",
    "for instance , breaking spiral density waves are themselves potent drivers for strong turbulence ( _ boley et al . _ , 2005 ) .",
    "another suggestion for particle growth beyond a meter in turbulent nebulae is motivated by observed size - sorting in chondrites .",
    "_ cuzzi et al . _",
    "( 1996 , 2001 ) have advanced the model of turbulent concentration of chondrule - sized ( mm or smaller diameter ) particles into dense zones , that ultimately become the planetesimals we observe .",
    "this effect , which occurs in genuine , 3d turbulence ( both in numerical models and laboratory experiments ) , naturally satisfies meteoritics observations in several ways under quite plausible nebula conditions .",
    "it offers the potential to leapfrog the problematic meter - size range entirely and would be applicable ( to differing particle types ) throughout the solar system ( see _ cuzzi and weidenschilling _ , 2005 and _ cuzzi et al .",
    "_ , 2005 for reviews ) .",
    "this scenario faces the obstacle that the dense , particle - rich zones which certainly _ do _ form are far from solid density , and might be disrupted by gas pressure or turbulence before they can form solid planetesimals . as with dense midplane layers of small particles ,",
    "gas pressure is a formidable barrier to gravitational instability on a dynamical timescale in dense zones of chondrule - sized particles formed by turbulent concentration .",
    "however , as with other small - particle scenarios , sedimentation is a possibility on longer timescales than that of dynamical collapse .",
    "it is promising that _ sekiya _ ( 1983 ) found that zones of these densities , while `` incompressible '' on the dynamical timescale , form stable modes .",
    "current studies are assessing whether the dense zones can survive perturbations long enough to evolve into planetesimals .",
    "as of the writing of this chapter , the path to planetesimal formation remains unclear . in nonturbulent nebulae ,",
    "a variety of options seem to exist for growth which - while not on dynamical collapse timescales , is rapid on cosmogonic timescales ( @xmath172 years )",
    ". however , this set of conditions and growth timescales seems to be at odds with asteroidal , meteoritic , and astronomical observations of several kinds ( _ russell et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ; _ dullemond and dominik _ , 2005",
    "; _ cuzzi and weidenschilling _ , 2006 ; _ cuzzi et al . _ , 2005 ; chapter by _ wadhwa et al . _ ) .",
    "the alternate set of scenarios - growth beyond a meter or so in size in turbulent nebulae - are perhaps more consistent with the observations but are still incompletely developed beyond some promising directions .",
    "the challenge is to describe quantitatively the rate at which planetesimals form under these inefficient conditions .",
    "globally modeling a protoplanetary disk including dust settling , aggregation , radial drift and mixing , along with radiative transfer solutions for the disk temperature and spectrum form a major numerical challenge , because of the many orders of magnitude that have to be covered both in time scales ( inner disk versus outer disk , growth of small particles versus growth of large objects ) and particle sizes .",
    "further numerical difficulties result from the fact that small particles may contribute significantly to the growth of larger bodies , and careful renormalization schemes are necessary to treat these processes correctly and in a mass - conserving manner ( _ dullemond and dominik _ , 2005 ) .",
    "further difficulties arise from uncertainty about the strength and spatial extent of turbulence during the different evolutionary phases of a disk .",
    "a complete model covering an entire disk and the entire growth process along with all relevant disk physics is currently still out of reach .",
    "work so far has therefore either focused on specific locations in the disk , or has used parametrized descriptions of turbulence with limited sets of physical growth processes .",
    "however , these `` single slice '' models have the problem that radial drift can become so large for m - sized objects , that these leave the slice on a time scale of a few orbital times ( _ weidenschilling _ , 1977 ; section [ sec : prior - to - midplane ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , important results have come forth from these efforts , that test underlying assumptions of the models .    for the spectral and imaging appearance of disks ,",
    "there are two main processes that should produce easily observable results : particle settling and particle growth .",
    "particle settling is due to the vertical component of gravity acting in the disk on the pressure - less dust component ( section [ sec : role - of - turb ] ) .",
    "neglecting growth for the moment , settling leads to a vertical stratification and size sorting in the disk .",
    "small particles settle slowly and should be present in the disk atmosphere for a long time , while large particles settle faster and to smaller scale heights .",
    "while in a laminar nebula this is a purely time dependent phenomenon , this result is permanent in a turbulent nebula as each particle size is spread over its equilibrium scale height ( _ dubrulle et al . _ ,",
    "1995 ) . from a pure settling model",
    ", one would therefore expect that _ small dust grains _ will increasingly dominate dust emission features ( cause strong feature - to - continuum ratios ) as large grains disappear from the surface layers .",
    "grain growth may have the opposite effect . while vertical mixing and settling still should lead to a size stratification ,",
    "particle growth can become so efficient that all small particles are removed from the gas . in this case",
    ", dust emission features should be characteristic for _ larger particles _",
    "( i.e. no or weak features , see chapter by _ natta et al . _ ) . at the same time , the overall opacity decreases dramatically .",
    "this effect can become significant , as has been realized already early on ( _ weidenschilling _ , 1980 , 1984 ; _ mizuno _ , 1989 ) . in order to keep the small particle abundance at realistic levels and the dust opacity high , _",
    "mizuno et al . _",
    "( 1988 ) considered a steady inflow of small particles into a disk .",
    "however , disks with signs of small particles are still observed around stars that seem to have completely removed their parental clouds , so this is not a general solution for this problem . in the following",
    "we discuss the different disk models documented in the literature .",
    "we begin with a discussion of earlier models focusing on specific regions of the solar system .",
    "models considering dust settling and growth in a single vertical slice have a long tradition , and have been reviewed in previous protostars and planets iii ( _ cuzzi and weidenschilling _ , 1993 ) .",

    "growth initially proceeds by brownian motion , without significant settling , for the first 10000yrs .",
    "then , particles become large enough and start to settle , so that the concentration of solids increases quickly after @xmath173yr .",
    "the particle layer reaches the critical density where the layer gravitational instability is often assumed to occur , but first the high velocity dispersion prevents the collapse .",

    "these very ambitious models include a radiation hydrodynamic code that can treat dust aggregation and shattering using an implicit numerical scheme .",
    "they find that during a collapse phase of 10@xmath73 years , dust particles grow due to brownian motion and differential radiative forces , and can be shattered by high velocity collisions cause by radiative forces . during early disk evolution",
    ", they find that at 30au from the star within the first pressure scale height from the midplane , small particles are heavily depleted because the high densities lead to frequent collisions .",
    "the largest particles grow by a factor of 100 in mass .",
    "similar results are found for pca particles , while cca particles show accelerated aggregation because of the enhanced cross section in massive particles . within 10@xmath174 years , most dust moves to the size grid limit of 0.2 mm . while aggregation is significant near the midplane ( opacities are reduced by more than a factor 10 ) , the overall structure of the model is not yet affected strongly , because at the low densities",
    "far from the midplane aggregation is limited and changes in the opacity are only due to differential advection .",
    "settling of dust without growth goes much slower than settling that is accelerated by growth .",
    "however , even pure settling calculations show significant influence on the spectral energy distributions of disks . while the vertical optical depth is unaffected by settling alone , the height at which stellar light is intercepted by the disk surface changes . _ miyake and nakagawa _ ( 1995 ) computed the effects of dust settling on the global sed and compared these results with iras observations .",
    "they assume that after the initial settling and growth phase , enough small particles are left in the disk to provide an optically thick surface and follow the decrease of the height of this surface , concluding that this is consistent with the life - times of t tauri disks , because the settling time of a 0.1 grain within a single pressure scale height is of order 10myr .",
    "however , the initial settling phase does lead to strong effects on the sed , because settling times at several pressure scale heights are much shorter . _ dullemond and dominik _ ( 2004 ) show that settling from a fully mixed passive disk leads to a decrease of the surface height in 10@xmath17510@xmath176 years , and can even lead to self - shadowed disks ( see chapter by _ dullemond et al . _ ) .",

    "_ ciesla and cuzzi _ ( 2005 ) model the global disk using a four - component model : dust grains , m - size boulders , planetesimals and the disk gas .",
    "this model tries to capture the main processes happening in a disk : growth of dust grains to m - sized bodies , the migration of m - sized bodies and the resulting creation of evaporation fronts , and the mixing of small particles and gas by turbulence .",
    "the paper focuses on the distribution of water in the disk , and the dust growth processes are handled by assuming timescales for the conversion from one size to the next .",
    "such models are therefore mainly useful for the chemical evolution of the nebula and need detailed aggregation calculations as input .",

    "their calculations are limited to compact solid particles .",
    "dd05 s model is incomplete in that it does not consider the contributions of radial drift and differential angular velocities between different particles .",
    "but in addition to calculations for a laminar nebula , they also introduce turbulent mixing and turbulent coagulation , as well as pca and cca properties for the resulting dust particles .",

    "both models find that aggregation proceeds more rapidly in the inner regions of the disk than in the outer regions , quickly leading to a region of low optical depth in the inner disk .",
    "both calculations find that a bi - modal size distribution is formed , with large particles in the midplane , formed by rainout ( the fast settling of particles after their settling time has decreased below their growth time ) and continuing to grow quickly , and smaller particles remaining higher up in the disk and then slowly trickling down . in the laminar disk ,",
    "growth stops in the dd05 calculations at cm sizes because radial drift was ignored . in thi05",
    ", particles continue to grow beyond this regime .",
    "the settling of dust causes the surface height of the disk to decrease , reducing the overall capacity of the disk to reprocess stellar radiation .",
    "thi05 find that at 8 au from the star the optical depth of the disk at 10 reaches about unity after a bit less than 10@xmath19yrs . in the inner disk ,",
    "the surface height decreases to almost zero in less than 10@xmath19yrs .",
    "the sed of the model shows first a strong decrease at wavelength of 100 and longer , within the first 10@xmath178yrs .",
    "after that the near - ir and mid - ir radiation also decreases sharply .",
    "thi05 consider their results to be roughly consistent with the observations of decreasing fluxes at near - ir and mm wavelengths in disks .",
    "the calculations by dd05 show a more dramatic effect , as shown in fig.[fig - sed ] . in the calculations for a laminar disk , here",
    "the surface height already significantly decreases in the first 10@xmath174 years , then the effect on the sed is initially strongest in the mid - ir region .",
    "after 10@xmath19yrs , the fluxes have dropped globally by at least a factor of 10 , except for the mm regime , which is affected greatly only after a few times 10@xmath19 years .    in the calculations for a turbulent disk ( dd05 ) , the depletion of small grains in the inner disk",
    "is strongly enhanced .",
    "this result is caused by several effects .",
    "first , turbulent mixing keeps the particles moving even after they have settled to the mid - plane , allowing them to be mixed up and rain down again through a cloud of particles .",
    "furthermore , vertical mixing in the higher disk regions mixes low - density material down to higher densities , where aggregation can proceed much faster .",
    "the material being mixed back up above the disk is then largely deprived of solids , because the large dust particles decouple from the gas and stay behind , settling down to the mid plane .",
    "the changes to the sed caused by coagulation and settling in a turbulent disk are dramatic , and clearly inconsistent with the observations of disks around t tauri stars that indicate lifetimes of up to 10@xmath177 years .",
    "dd05 conclude that ongoing particle destruction must play an important role , leading to a steady - state size distribution for small particles ( section [ physical properties of aggregates ] ) .      up to now",
    ", most solutions for the aggregation equation in disks are still based on the assumption of compact particles resulting from the growth process . however , at least for the small aggregates formed initially , this assumption is certainly false .",
    "first of all , if aggregates are fluffy , with large surface - to - mass ratios , it will be much easier to keep these particles in the disk surface where they can be observed as scattering and ir emitting grains .",
