    "the phase space of the galaxy s disk , as observed near the sun , contains substructure within the larger structures known as the thin and the thick disk .",
    "substructures include open clusters and stellar streams , also often referred to as moving groups . moving groups , as promoted by eggen",
    "( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , are considered to be stars having a common space motion and a common chemical composition , and originating from a disssolving open cluster . while some of the well known moving groups do share a common composition ( e.g. , the hr 1614 group - @xcite ) suggesting they come from a tidally - disrupted open cluster , other groups contain stars having very different compositions , a result demanding an origin more complex than disruption of an open cluster .",
    "the term ` stream ' is now applied to some entities in galactic phase space .",
    "examples in the thin disk include the hercules stream @xcite and the hyades stream or supercluster ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for streams in the thin disk ,",
    "a likely explanation involves dynamical interactions of disk stars with the central bar @xcite or spiral density waves @xcite .",
    "other possibilities arise for streams belonging to the thick disk including accretion from external galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we present chemical compositions for subdwarfs belonging to two streams in the thick disk .",
    "@xcite undertook a search for fine structure in the phase space populated by subdwarfs from the large sample of f and g subdwarfs considered by @xcite for which @xcite refined data on stellar distances and kinematics .",
    "two clumps in phase space were noted by @xcite .",
    "one with @xmath1 @xmath2 km s@xmath3 and @xmath4 km s@xmath3 is referred to as the arcturus stream .",
    "an arcturus moving group had been previously identified by @xcite .",
    "the second stream af06 with a stronger presence in phase space than the arcturus stream is at @xmath5 km s@xmath3 and @xmath6 km s@xmath3 .    here ,",
    "we report chemical compositions of stars from these two streams .",
    "we show that stars in both streams span a range in metallicity but with relative abundances which match closely the ratios reported for field thick disk stars .",
    "this result serves to constrain greatly explanations for the origins of the two streams .",
    "stars selected for observation came from membership lists of the arcturus and af06 streams given by @xcite : 18 of the 22 stars in former stream and 26 of the 44 stars in the latter stream were observed successfully with the tull coud spectrograph @xcite at the 2.7 meter harlan j. smith telescope of the w.j .",
    "mcdonald observatory .",
    "spectra at a resolving power of 60,000 were obtained with spectral coverage from about 3800   - 10000    with echelle orders incompletely recorded on the ccd beyond about 5800  .",
    "wavelength calibration was provided by an exposure of a th - ar hollow cathode lamp .",
    "these two - dimensional data were reduced to one - dimensional relative flux versus wavelength spectra using the image reduction and analysis facility(iraf ) . in a typical spectrum , the s / n ratio at the centre of an order over most of the full spectral range was 100 or greater .",
    "atmospheric parameters @xmath0 effective temperature ( t@xmath7 ) , surface gravity ( log @xmath8 ) and metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) have been derived from both photometric and spectroscopic data . in the former case , we relied on published catalogues of photometry and parallaxes , empirical calibrations and the theoretical stellar evolutionary models . and , in the latter case",
    ", our high resolution spectra were used to derive the atmospheric parameters including microturbulence ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "below , both the procedures are described in brief .",
    "the t@xmath7 is derived using ( v - k@xmath10 ) colour and strmgren photometry ( @xmath11 ) calibrations .",
    "the k@xmath10 magnitude is taken from 2mass catalogue @xcite .",
    "the subscript `` s '' stands for the bandpass of the k filter in the 2mass survey , i.e. , the k@xmath10 filter is narrower than the johnson k filter .",
    "the k@xmath10 magnitudes are converted to standard `` k '' magnitudes using relations given in @xcite .",
    "the mean difference between the two magnitudes is only k@xmath10 @xmath0 k@xmath12 = @xmath00.001 @xmath13 0.005 and will have no effect when k@xmath10 is used in place of k magnitudes in the calibration between ( v - k ) and t@xmath7 .",
    "the v magnitudes for all the stars were adopted from @xcite .",
    "the ( v - k ) colour and the empirical relations provided in @xcite are used in deriving t@xmath7 .",
    "strmgren colours and indices ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) are available for 26 out of 44 stars in the sample @xcite .",
    "values of metallicity and t@xmath7 were obtained using empirical calibrations of strmgren colours and indices given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "values of metallicity are quite sensitive to reddening as it makes observed @xmath17 more positive and @xmath15 values more negative than their intrinsic colours .",
    "however , we expect no significant reddening as the stars are nearby ( d @xmath18130 pc from the sun ) .",
    "using the methods given in @xcite , reddening values e(@xmath14 ) have been estimated and , indeed , all reddening estimates are vanishingly small : e(@xmath14 ) @xmath19 0.001@xmath130.006 .",
    "temperatures derived using ( v - k@xmath10 ) and strmgren colours are given in table  1 as ( t@xmath7)@xmath20 and ( t@xmath7)@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the mean difference between the two temperatures , ( t@xmath7)@xmath20 @xmath0 ( t@xmath7)@xmath21 = 18 @xmath13 90 k , excluding the outliers hip24030 , hip53070 , hip11952 and g192@xmath021 , for which the difference is large 245 @xmath13 24 k , i.e. , t@xmath7 derived from ( v - k@xmath10 ) colour are hotter than those from @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath17 temperature of hip 24030 and ( v - k@xmath10 ) temperature of g192@xmath021 are much closer to the values obtained using spectroscopy . in the case of the other two , we suspect errors in one of the their colours .",
    "the log @xmath8 value is derived from the trignometrical parallax , the ( b - v ) colour , and theoretical isochrones @xcite .",
    "errors in the parallax and ( b - v ) colour are taken into account in estimating the uncertainty in the log @xmath8 value .",
    "a full set of atmospheric parameters ( t@xmath7 , log @xmath8 , @xmath9 , [ m / h ] ) has been derived from spectral line analysis by standard lte techniques . in this exercise , the lte kurucz grid of atlas9 model atmospheres with the convective overshoot option was adopted @xcite .",
    "the rationale for choosing overshoot models for solar type dwarf stars was given in @xcite . since we intend to compare our results with the results from the thin and thick disk studies of reddy et al .",
    ", we followed their analysis techniques .",
    "the lte line analysis code moog @xcite in its 2009 version was used throughout .",
    "the effective temperature was set by the requirement that the fe abundance provided by fei lines be independent of the lower excitation potential ( lep ) of the selected lines . while deriving t@xmath7 , caution was taken to minimise the effect of microturbulence by choosing , initially , very weak lines with a sufficient range in lep .",
    "later , microturbulence ( @xmath9 ) was derived by adding fei lines of moderately strong equivalent width ( w@xmath22 @xmath19 120 m ) so that the abundance trend becomes sensitive to changes in @xmath9 .",
    "the chosen value of @xmath9 is that for which the abundance is independent of equivalent width .",
    "the surface gravity log @xmath8 was obtained by requiring that , for the given t@xmath7 and @xmath9 , fei and feii lines give the same fe abundance . the uncertainties in the derived parameters",
    "have been estimated by inspection of dependencies for combinations of models of different sets of parameters . in the case of t@xmath7",
    ", we varied the best representative t@xmath7 in steps of 25  k for given log @xmath8 , @xmath23 and [ m / h ] .",
    "for steps of 25  k changes , we found no significant changes in the slope as well as in abundances , however , we see ( see figure  2 ) noticeble changes in abundance trends by increasing or decreasing 50  k from its mean model t@xmath7 . thus , we estimate @xmath1350 k as an uncertainty in the best fit model atmosphere .",
    "similarly , we found model uncertaities in log @xmath8 and @xmath23 .",
    "in figure  2 , estimation of uncertainties is illustrated for t@xmath7 and @xmath24 . in this way",
    ", we found model uncertainties in t@xmath7 , log @xmath8 , and @xmath23 : @xmath13 50  k , @xmath13 0.20 cm s@xmath25 , @xmath13 0.20 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these individual uncertainties translate to an effective error of @xmath13 0.05 dex in metallicity [ fe / h ] .",
    "next , photometric and spectroscopic estimates of model atmosphere parameters are compared .",
    "temperature , log @xmath8 and metallicity comparisons are given in figure  1 .",
    "the mean difference between ( t@xmath7)@xmath20 and spectroscopic t@xmath7 is just -9 @xmath13 87  k. there are a few outliers hip24030 and hip94931 ( for which ( t@xmath7)@xmath21 values are closer to spectroscopic t@xmath7 ) , g10@xmath012 and hip9080 ( for which ( t@xmath7)@xmath21 not available ) with a difference of -77 @xmath13 174  k. excluding the outliers the mean difference becomes -2 @xmath13 73  k. the log @xmath8 values obtained from photometry are in good agreement with the spectroscopic values : the difference between the two methods is only 0.002 @xmath13 0.18 cm s@xmath25 for 23 stars for which photometric gravities could be obtained , a difference within the combined uncertainties . the mean difference between the photometric metallicity from strmgren photometry and the spectroscopic metallicity is @xmath00.03 @xmath13 0.11 dex for 25 stars for which strmgren photometry is available .",
    "star g192@xmath021 is an outliers whose spectroscopic metallicity is about 0.7 dex metal richer compared to the corresponding photometric value .",
    "difference is probably due to erroneous strmgren photometry .",
    "for the two metal - poor stars hip53070 and hip11952 , too few lines are available for a spectroscopic determination of parameters and , therefore , we have adopted photometric ( t@xmath7)@xmath21 and log @xmath8 values .",
    "the microturbulent velocity @xmath9 calculated using the relation given in @xcite between @xmath9 , t@xmath7 , and log @xmath8 was adopted for both stars . in the final calculations of abundances we adopt parameters derived from spectroscopy but no conclusions",
    "would be changed were the photometric parameters adopted .",
    "elemental abundances have been derived using measured equivalent widths and synthetic spectra with lte model atmospheres for the adopted stellar parameters taken from kurucz grid @xcite and the 2009 version of lte line analysis code moog . the line list compiled by @xcite",
    "was adopted .",
    "solar abundances derived by @xcite have been used as rereference values , except eu abundance . the solar eu abundance ( log @xmath26(eu ) = 0.55 ) has been derived , for this study , using the atlas solar spectrum @xcite and two eu ii lines ( 6645.13  , 4129.72  ) . for transitions with significant hyperfine structure ( hfs )",
    "data were taken from kurucz hfs data base @xcite .",
    "the lines of mn , v , cu , and eu with hfs were analyzed by computing synthetic spectra . in the case of vanadium , the line at 6216.36  , one of the six lines used previously ,",
    "is now judged to be blended in the cooler stars and is omitted from the analysis of such stars .",
    "elemental abundances are summarized in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "uncertainties in the derived abundances arise primarily from uncertainties in the derived atmospheric parameters , the equivalent widths ( w@xmath22 ) and oscillator strengths ( log @xmath27 ) .",
    "the latter two quantities affect primarily the line - to - line scatter . of course , the line - to - line scatter is to some extent also influenced by uncertain model parameters .",
    "uncertainty in the log @xmath27 values is minimized as our analysis is a differential one with respect to solar spectrum and photospheric abundances .",
    "error in the measured w@xmath22 is estimated following the recipe given in @xcite .",
    "for the quality of our data , uncertainty in the measured w@xmath22 varies from 1m to about 2.5m .",
    "we have taken on average 2m as the uncertainty in the measured w@xmath22 . in table  4 , we have provided for one representative star ( hip40613 ) , estimated uncertainties for each element in the form of @xmath28[x / fe ] due to @xmath29t@xmath7 , @xmath29log @xmath8 , @xmath29    @xmath9 , @xmath29[m / h ] , and @xmath29w@xmath22 . assuming all five sources of error discussed above are independent , the combined error is obtained by adding them in quadrature .",
    "this we call our measured uncertainty or @xmath30 .",
    "uncertainties in abundances can also be gauged by comparing results for stars that are common in this and other studies . for seven stars that are common with thick disk sample study by @xcite ,",
    "differences in the derived abundance ratios [ x / fe ] between the studies are given in table  5 .",
    "the differences are quite small and less than measured uncertaintity ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the good agreement between the two studies implies that the results of the two streams in this study can be compared directly with the results of thick disk sample study from @xcite .",
    "this is akin to a differential analysis with respect to thick disk .",
    "both streams were identified by @xcite as over - densities of stars in phase space . to represent stars in phase space",
    "one requires information such as coordinates , radial velocities , distance ( parallaxes ) , and proper motions . in the calculation of galactic motions",
    "@xcite used hipparcos data @xcite and radial velocities from @xcite . recently ,",
    "hipparcos observations were re - reduced by @xcite .",
    "consequently , we have rederived the galactic velocities ( u , v , w ) for stream members using the revised hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions and including the radial velocities derived from our mcdonald spectra .",
    "radial velocities obtained in this study are in very good agreement with the velocities given in @xcite .",
    "the mean difference between the two studies is 0.15 @xmath13 0.50 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the u , v and w velocities with respect to the sun were calculated using the method given in @xcite .",
    "a right - handed coordinate system is used throughout where u is positive towards the galactic center , v is positive in the direction of galactic rotation and w is positive towards the north galactic pole ( ngp ) .",
    "velocities ( u , v , w ) are in good agreement with values given by @xcite ; differences between the two studies are mainly due to the updated parallaxes .",
    "none of the stars identified as members by @xcite lost their membership in either stream .",
    "derived radial velocities ( r@xmath31 ) and galactic velocities ( u@xmath32 , v@xmath32 , w@xmath32 ) relative to local standard of rest ( lsr ) are given in table  6 .",
    "in conversion to the lsr frame , the solar motion of ( u@xmath33 , v@xmath33 , w@xmath33 ) = ( @xmath3410.0 , @xmath345.3 , @xmath347.2 ) km s@xmath3 ) is used @xcite .",
    "the mean motion ( u@xmath32 , v@xmath32 , w@xmath32 ) of the arcturus stream based on the 18 member stars observed by us is ( @xmath06.48 @xmath13 49.29 , @xmath0124.79 @xmath13 8.92 , @xmath011.5 @xmath13 49.59 ) and for af06 stream the mean motion is ( @xmath041.55 @xmath13 47.45 , @xmath087.35 @xmath13 7.83 , 3.82 @xmath13 54.34 ) .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the streams central values given in @xcite .",

    "orbital parameters : mean of apogalactic and perigalactic distance ( r@xmath35 ) , eccentricity ( e ) , maximum distance star away from the galactic plane ( z@xmath36 ) have been derived and given in table  6 . a distance of 8.5 kpc beween the sun and the galactic center",
    "is used in the calculation .",
    "the ( u , v , w ) of both the streams , as @xcite appreciated , suggest that the streams are part of the thick disk .",
    "probabilities that a particular star belongs to the halo , the thick or the thin disk are calculated using the definitions and recipes given in @xcite . the percentage probability ( p )",
    "that a star belongs to the thick disk is given in table  6 .",
    "all the arcturus stream members in our sample are thick disk stars with a probability p@xmath37 @xmath38 80 @xmath39 , while 15 out of the 26 af06 stream members have a probability that would qualify them as thick disk members with the remaining 11 stars having probabilities placing them in either the thin or thick disks .    in figure  3 , sample stars of the two streams along with the representative members of the thick disk , the thin disk and the halo are shown in the space of angular momentum per unit mass components j@xmath40 , and j@xmath41= @xmath42 the azimuthal and perpendicular components , respectively .",
    "in angular momentum space , stars are clustered in a small region compared to their distribution in the velocity space ( see @xcite ) .",
    "values are calculated in the right - handed coordinate system and the lsr velocity is assumed to be 220 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the value j@xmath43 = 0 implies no rotational velocity in the direction of the galactic rotation and increasing values mean higher rotational velocities . the j@xmath41 represents extent of tilt of star s orbit with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "obviously , for the thin disk it is quite small .",
    "arcturus stream and af06 stream have a mean j@xmath44 of @xmath0811 @xmath13 77 kpc km s@xmath3 and @xmath01130 @xmath13 63 kpc km , s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the presence of the arcturus stream was detected by @xcite in catalogues of metal - poor stars by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "their detected structure has angular momentum ( j@xmath40 ) in the range of ( 700 @xmath0 1100 ) km @xmath47 kpc .",
    "it appears to us that this structure detected by @xcite is the combined structure of the arcturus and the af06 stream but this structure was separated into two different streams by @xcite using the wavelet transform technique . by combining our samples of both streams , we get mean values v@xmath32 and j@xmath44 ( @xmath0102.67@xmath1320.34 , @xmath01000@xmath13173 ) very similar to what @xcite found for the structure that they thought to be the single structure labelled the arcturus stream . the arcturus stream has been identified in recent studies @xcite as a significant over density in phase space .",
    "@xcite s study is based on more than 7000 stars within a distance of 500  pc taken from rave survey .",
    "they have identified stars with high orbital eccentricities having over - densities at about v= @xmath0120 km s@xmath3 and the second one at v=@xmath095 km",
    "s@xmath3 which coincide with phase space coordinates of the arcturus and af06 streams as given @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined a data set of 16,000 giants from the rave survey and showed pronounced over - density of stars at velocities overlapping with the arcturus stream in the solar circle .",
    "determination of stellar ages from location of a star in a colour - magnitude diagram is an uncertain procedure because the majority of the stars in both streams fall very close to the zero age main sequence .",
    "for the few stars that appear relatively evolved off the main sequence ages were estimated .",
    "mean ages with upper and lower limits are given in table  6 .",
    "errors in b - v and parallaxes are used to estimate the limits . in figure  4 , the stars are shown in the hr diagram of m@xmath48 versus ( b - v ) colour along with isochrones of ages 10 gyrs , 12 gyrs and 16 gyrs for the metallicities [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.70 dex and [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.51 dex , for arcturus stream and af06 stream respectively .",
    "ages of the stream members range from 10 to 14 gyrs .",
    "the stellar ages , therefore , are very similar to the ages of thick disk field stars which are all older than about 10@xmath011 gyr @xcite .",
    "the derived ages are in good agreement with previous studies of arcturus group ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) based on different selections of stream members .",
    "since their discovery ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , various theories have been put forward to explain the substructures in phase space known variously as moving groups or stellar streams .",
    "the most prominent theories identify a stellar stream as either a ) a dissolved open cluster , b ) debris from an accreted satellite galaxy , or c ) the result of dynamical perturbations within the galaxy",
    ".    in establishing the correct explanation for a particular stream , the importance of the chemical signatures or chemical tagging of stream members has been recognized ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) not only to pinpoint their origin but also to understand the formation and evolution of the disk .",
    "quantitative abundances of twenty elements has been extracted here for members of the two streams .",
    "there are three main groups of elements : iron peak ( v , cr , mn , fe , ni , co ) , @xmath49-elements ( o , mg , si , ca , ti ) , and heavy elements such as @xmath50-process ( ba , nd ) and @xmath51-process ( eu ) elements . for the present ( thin ) disk ,",
    "iron peak elements mostly come from type ia supernovae explosions ( snia ) and the @xmath49-elements are primarily produced in type ii supernovae ( snii ) .",
    "the @xmath50-process elements are known to be produced mainly in evolved stars of low and intermediate mass ( 1 @xmath0 8m@xmath33 ) with the lighter @xmath50-process elements also contributed by snii .",
    "eu , an @xmath51-process element , is most proably produced in snii",
    ". therefore , an abundance ratio of products of snia and snii helps to track the chemical history of a stellar system .",
    "abundances of elements from o to eu in the form of [ x / fe ] ratios , where x is any element , are given in table  2 and  3 and shown in figures  5 , 6 , and 7 as the run of [ x / fe ] against [ fe / h ] .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the streams is shown in figure  8 for the arcturus and af06 streams .",
    "next , we discuss these abundances for the arcturus and af06 streams in the light of the proposed scenarios for the origin of stellar streams .",
    "dispersal of an open cluster as the origin of a stellar stream is one explanation from the suite of potential explanations that is directly testable from photometric and spectroscopic determinations of stellar compositions . given that open clusters exhibit chemical homogeneity , if a stream represents a dissolved cluster , one requires chemical homogeneity also among stream members .",
    "chemical homogeneity is not a characteristic of these two streams .",
    "results shown in figure  8 and table  2 show that stellar metallicities span a wide range for both streams . for the arcturus stream ,",
    "[ fe / h ] runs from @xmath01.40 to @xmath00.37 . for af06 stream ,",
    "the range is from @xmath52 to @xmath53 but the range is @xmath01.69 to @xmath00.17 for those 15 members with a high probability of belonging to the thick disk . for a strictly homogenous populations such as open and globular clusters",
    "the degree of chemical homogeneity is quite high and which is about 0.05 dex ( @xcite , @xcite ) for a number of elements . in the case of [ fe / h ]",
    "dispersions are found to be in the range of 0.02 @xmath0 0.1 and in some extreme cases dispersions are of the order of 0.2 dex @xcite .",
    "the wide range in metallicity clearly shows that the systems from which the stream members originated had a relatively long history with a multiple episodes of star formation .    we have also inspected the sample for an evidence of a sub - group with chemical homegenity .",
    "results shown in figure  5 , 6 and 7 indicate existence of no such a group among arcturus stream sample , however , for the stream af06 , we find a hint of clustering of stars at [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.4 .",
    "about 8 stars ( out of total 26 ) show metallicity [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.4 within the dispersion of 0.04 dex .",
    "does it mean that part of the sample stars originated from the disrupted cluster ?",
    "probably not , this may be a manifestation of thick disk metallicity distribution which peaks at about @xmath00.6 dex , and to some extent due to a smaller sample size .",
    "thus , neither the arcturus nor the af06 stream , as shown by metallicity distribution of member stars of the two streams ( see figure  8) , is a dissolved open cluster .",
    "this conclusion about the arcturus stream was reached also by @xcite who selected 134 stream members by selection criteria different from those used by @xcite and applied to stellar catalogues other than that compiled by @xcite .",
    "their analyses of high - resolution spectra led to a [ fe / h ] range similar to that quoted above ( see also @xcite ) .      among thick disk field stars in the solar neighborhood",
    ", there is a strikingly very small dispersion in elemental abundance ratios , i.e. , [ x / fe ] at a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "indeed , @xcite found the [ x / fe ] to be gaussian - like with a dispersion @xmath54 of less than 0.10 dex for the most of the elements except for v , y , and zr for which @xmath54 is slightly more than 0.1 dex .",
    "furthermore , such dispersions were uncorrected for measurement uncertainties so that the intrinsic or ` cosmic ' dispersion must be very small .",
    "in sharp contrast to the very similar [ x / fe ] ratios at a given [ fe / h ] for local field stars , element ratios reflecting different contributions from major processes of stellar nucleosynthesis do vary from stellar system to stellar system .",
    "for example , ratios in the galactic bulge are not uniformly identical at a given [ fe / h ] to those among local thick or thin disk field stars .",
    "similarly , ratios of @xmath49-elements ( [ @xmath49/fe ] ) at a given [ fe / h ] among stars of dwarf spheroidal galaxies differ appreciably from those of local stars and from galaxy to galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this has been illustrtated in figure  9 where ratio of [ @xmath49-process / fe ] ( mean of @xmath49-process elements mg , si , ca and ti ) is compared with that of thick disk @xcite and a number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies for which data was taken from ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    therefore , the chemical signatures or tags in the form of [ x / fe ] for those key elements from the major processes of nucleosynthesis may test some proposed origins for the streams . to address the question",
    "` are these two streams chemically identical to thick disk field stars ? ' , we show plots of [ x / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] in figures 5 to 7 with field stars from @xcite shown as by grey symbols , and the arcturus and af06 stream members shown as black filled circles . to quantify possible systematic offsets between the field thick disk and stream members ,",
    "we compute mean values and dispersions for the arcturus and af06 streams over the [ fe / h ] interval @xmath00.30 to @xmath01.0 .",
    "dispersions about the trends is a combination of both the cosmic scatter as well as errors associated with the model parameters .",
    "the values ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) are computed as the standard deviation of the residuals from straight line fits to abundance trends of [ x / fe ] against [ fe / h ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath57 for the thick disk abundance trends of @xcite are computed over the same interval .",
    "all results are provided in table  7 . in figure  10 , we made comparison of @xmath57 with those of arcturus and af06 streams .",
    "dispersion values about the abundance trends of arcturus stream show very good agreement with that of the thick disk within about 0.02 .",
    "however , for af06 stream , in most cases , dispersions are lower by 0.01 @xmath0 0.03 compared to thick disk dispersions . with the current limited sample",
    "it would be far fetching to attribute this to the different chemical evolution for the af06 stream and hence external origin to it .",
    "mean abundances of arcturus and af06 streams are quite similar and the differences are within 0.05 dex except three elements ( o , cu , eu ) for which difference is 0.06 - 0.07 dex .",
    "dispersions about the trends for all the elements are comparable to the estimated scatter ( @xmath58 ) due to uncertainties in model parameters",
    ". diferences between dispersions and @xmath58    are within 0.05 dex .",
    "thus , we conclude that the streams are chemically identical to within high precision with the field thick disk stars .",
    "given that external galaxies of the local group have different element ratios across the [ fe / h ] range sampled by these two streams , especially for @xmath49-elements ( see , for example , @xcite , figure  11 ) , it seems most unlikely that either stream represents debris from an accreted satellite galaxy .",
    "the outstanding results of our abundance analyses are that the subdwarfs comprising the arcturus stream and af06 stream identified as over - densities in phase space by @xcite have ( i ) a considerable spread in metallicity and ( ii ) relative abundance [ x / fe ] identical to those of the galactic thick disk .",
    "the metallicity spread excludes the hypothesis that either stream represents a dissolved open cluster .",
    "the high - degree of similarity between [ x / fe ] at a given [ fe / h ] for these streams and the field stars of the thick disk greatly strains a proposal that these streams represent the tidal debris of an accreted satellite galaxy . by exclusion ,",
    "the likely origin of these streams is that they are the product of dynamical interactions within the galaxy",
    ".    however , chemical identiy with the thick disk and the non - similarity of their chemistry with the satellite galaxies within local group alone may not suffice to rule out the possibility of these streams being a result of disrupted satellites .",
    "it is still a matter of debate how perturbation can create streams with such a very high velocity drag and exhibit very tight abundance trends .",
    "it would be important to know from the models the extent of regions that get affected due to bar / spiral perturbations and their effect on the abundance trends of clumped stars in phase space .",
    "astrometry from gaia will provide unprecented sample size as well as accuracy to map the galaxy precisely which would decipher the galaxy formation and evolution .",
