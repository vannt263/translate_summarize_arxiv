    "finite - gap periodic quantum systems play an important role in physics .",
    "they underly the theory of periodic solutions in nonlinear integrable systems , including the korteweg - de vries , the nonlinear schrdinger , the kadomtsev - petviashvili , and the sine - gordon equations @xcite .",
    "being analytically solvable systems , they find various applications in diverse areas .",
    "the list of their applications is extensive , and among others includes the modelling of crystals @xcite , the theory of monopoles @xcite , instantons and sphalerons @xcite , classical ginzburg - landau field theory @xcite , josephson junctions theory @xcite , magnetostatic problems @xcite , inhomogeneous cosmologies @xcite , kaluza- klein theories @xcite , chaos @xcite , preheating after inflation modern theories @xcite , string theory @xcite , matrix models @xcite , supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite and ads / cft duality @xcite .",
    "some time ago it was showed by braden and macfarlane @xcite , and in a more broad context by dunne and feinberg @xcite , that a usual @xmath3 supersymmetric extension of a periodic quantum system may produce a completely isospectral pair with a _ zero energy doublet _ of the ground states .",
    "such a picture is completely different from that taking place in non - periodic systems described by the same linear @xmath3 superalgebraic structure @xmath4 , @xmath5=0 $ ] .",
    "there , the complete isospectrality of the super - partners happens only in the case of a spontaneously broken supersymmetry , characterized by a positive energy of the lowest supersymmetric doublet  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was showed that there exist peculiar isospectral supersymmetric periodic systems , in which the partner potentials are identical in shape but mutually translated for a half - period , or reflected , or translated and reflected .",
    "a pair of super - partner potentials with such a property was named by dunne and feinberg as _ self - isospectral_. the phenomenon of self - isospectrality with a half - period shift was illustrated by some examples of exactly soluble models belonging to a class of finite - gap periodic systems .",
    "later on isospectral and self - isospectral supersymmetric finite - gap periodic systems were studied in various aspects @xcite , and it was found in @xcite that a property of the self - isospectrality may also appear in some periodic finite - gap systems based on a nonlinear supersymmetry of the second order @xmath6 , @xmath5=0 $ ] @xcite , where @xmath7 is a quadratic polynomial .",
    "the nature and origin of isospectrality and self - isospectrality in finite - gap systems have remained , however , to be obscure .",
    "recently we showed @xcite that self - isospectrality may be realized by a non - relativistic electron in the periodic magnetic and electric fields of a special form , and indicated on a peculiar non - linear supersymmetric structure associated with it .",
    "in the present paper , we study superextension of quantum periodic systems with a parity - even smooth finite - gap potential of general form , and show that it is characterized by an unusual tri - supersymmetric structure .",
    "this peculiar supersymmetric structure originates from the higher order differential operator of the lax pair , and its decomposability in pairs of nonsingular operators .",
    "the superalgebra , generated by three indicated integrals of motion together with trivial integrals associated with parity symmetry and matrix extension , has a nonlinear nature , that reflects a nonlinearity of a spectral polynomial of the original finite - gap system .",
    "the higher order operator of the lax pair of a nontrivial @xmath0-gap ( @xmath8 ) system admits @xmath1 nonsingular two - term decompositions . by means of the crum - darboux transformation , with each nonsingular decomposition we associate a particular tri - supersymmetric extension , and as a result get a family of @xmath9 completely isospectral systems .",
    "we show that a local part of the tri - supersymmetry is a spontaneously partially broken centrally extended nonlinear @xmath2 supersymmetry , that explains the nature and origin of the complete isospectrality .",
    "when the original finite - gap system has in its spectrum a nonzero number of anti - periodic singlet states corresponding to the edges of permitted bands , among all the non - singular decompositions of the higher order operator of the lax pair there is a special one which corresponds to a separation of all the singlets into orthogonal subspaces of periodic and anti - periodic states .",
    "we conjecture that it is this separation that produces a self - isospectral tri - supersymmetric system .",
    "this means particularly that all the set of @xmath9 completely isospectral systems we get , including the original @xmath0-gap system with the specified special property , is divided into @xmath10 self - isospectral tri - supersymmetric pairs",
    ". then we apply a general theory to a broad class of finite - gap elliptic ( double periodic ) quantum systems described by a two - parametric family of associated lam equations .",
    "any such a system has in its spectrum a non - empty subspace of anti - periodic singlet states , and we support our conjecture by the explicit construction of the self - isospectral tri - supersymmetric pairs . we also investigate a rather intricate picture of the infinite - period limit of the tri - supersymmetry .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we first discuss general properties of the finite - gap periodic systems with a smooth potential , and show that any parity - even @xmath0-gap system is characterized by a hidden bosonized @xmath3 nonlinear supersymmetry of order @xmath11 .",
    "this supersymmetry reflects the peculiarities of the band structure . in section 3",
    "we show how the tri - supersymmetric extensions of the system are constructed by means of the crum - darboux transformation .",
    "there we also investigate a general structure and properties of the tri - supersymmetry . in section 4",
    "we apply a general theory to the case of finite - gap elliptic systems described by the associated lam equation . in section 5 ,",
    "the infinite - period limit of the tri - supersymmetry is studied .",
    "section 6 is devoted to concluding remarks and outlook .",
    "to have a self - contained presentation , in this section we first summarize briefly the properties of the quantum periodic systems of a general form .",
    "then we restrict the consideration to the case of the smooth parity - even finite - gap systems to reveal in them a hidden bosonized nonlinear supersymmetry whose order is defined by the number of energy gaps .      consider a quantum system given by a hamiltonian operator @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with a real _ smooth _ periodic potential @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
