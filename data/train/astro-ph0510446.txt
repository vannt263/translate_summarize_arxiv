    "deep x  ray surveys turned out to be valuable diagnostic tools to investigate the galaxy formation history and large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the diffuse x  ray background ( xrb ) at the sky is composed of discrete sources that have been almost resolved by deep _",
    "rosat _ , _ asca _ , _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ observations at photon energies in the 0.1 - 10 kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x  ray sources in deep field observations are mostly active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "this has been confirmed by optical identification programmes with the _ keck _ ( @xcite ) , the _ vlt _ ( @xcite ) and _ combo17 _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "all agn are captured in different evolutionary stages .",
    "therefore , x  ray deep fields also probe the _ in vivo _ growth of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) that drive the agn luminosities according to a widely accepted paradigm .",
    "optical identification programmes provide cosmological redshifts of the x  ray sources .",
    "this can be done by spectroscopic or , especially at high redshifts , photometric methods ( @xcite ) .",
    "optical observations demonstrate that the number distributions in redshift space of all galaxy types peak around @xmath2 .",
    "further , the agn sample can be classified into agn type1 ( unabsorbed , unobscured ) and agn type2 ( absorbed , obscured ) by using optical and/or x  ray methods . in the optical ,",
    "agn type1 are defined as sources exhibiting broad balmer emission lines due to the fact that the observer is able to view the core of the agn from the outside .",
    "these features are lacking for agn type2 . in x ",
    "rays , agn type1 show an unabsorbed x  ray spectrum whereas agn type2 have absorbed spectra around photon energies from 0.5 - 1 kev .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : samp ] the soft x  ray selected sample is presented , sec .",
    "[ sec : xlf ] treats the method to analyse features and evolution of different agn object classes by means of x - ray luminosity functions .",

    "[ sec : discuss ] the results are compared to observational data from other work . finally , we conclude in sec . [",
    "sec : concl ] .",
    "a sample of about 1000 agn type1 is considered that has been merged from _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ surveys .",
    "the sources are restricted to the 0.52 kev band and cover five orders of magnitude in flux and six orders of magnitude in survey solid angle .",
    "this sample is with 95% highly complete allowing to construct luminosity functions over cosmological timescales with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "details of the soft x  ray sample are presented in @xcite ( h04 hereafter ; see table 1 therein ) .",
    "the advantage of restricting the sample only to type1 agn is that systematic uncertainties are excluded _",
    "a priori_. agn type2 can introduce these uncertainties by the varying and typically unknown agn absorption column densities . as demonstrated by @xcite",
    "the optical agn classification scheme suffers from dilution effects of agn excess light from stars in the host galaxy  especially at low x ",
    "ray luminosities and medium redshifts .",
    "then , only x  ray agn classification schemes as introduced by @xcite and @xcite can do the job . as anticipated agn are the main contributors to the xrb accounting for a fraction of about 70100% .",
    "a review about agn and their engines , smbhs , can be found in the phd thesis by @xcite .",
    "it was found that at faintest x  ray fluxes there are contributions by other population classes such as starburst and normal galaxies , see @xcite .",
    "as elaborated in @xcite ( hms05 hereafter ) the x - ray luminosity functions ( xlfs ) of the sample presented in sec . [ sec : samp ] are deduced by following two methods : the first ( binned ) method is presented in @xcite and is based on a variant of the @xmath3 method . in this approach ,",
    "the binned luminosity function in a given redshift bin @xmath4 is derived by dividing the observed number @xmath5 by the corresponding volume to the redshift range and appropriate survey x  ray flux limits and solid angles .",
    "each of the xlfs is fitted by an analytical function to determine the bias in this luminosity value caused by a gradient of the xlf across one bin . by means of the resulting analytical function",
    "one can predict @xmath6 .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 serves as a factor to correct the xlf due to bias to first order .",
    "+ the second ( unbinned ) method is based on unbinned data .",
    "individual @xmath8 values from _ rosat bright survey _ ( rbs )",
    "sources are used to evaluate the zero  redshift luminosity function ( 0zlf ) . by means of this",
    "lf the number of derived rbs sources matches accurately the observed number .",
    "hence , the advantage of this method is that it is free from bias effects emerging in the first method .",
    "evolution , i.e. space density as function of redshift , comes into play by introducing binning in luminosity and redshift .",
    "again , bias effects are avoided by iterating the parameters of an analytical representation of the space density function .",
    "together with the 0zlf this is used to predict @xmath6 for the surveys .",
    "finally , the observed space densities in each bin are evaluated by multiplying by the ratio @xmath7 with the space density value .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sxlf ] : this is the soft x  ray luminosity function ( sxlf ) in different redshift shells ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 of about 1000 agn type1 .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that the lf shape varies with redshift . the typical two power",
    " law model is confirmed .",
    "fits of the @xmath11dependent lf profiles strongly suggest a luminosity  dependent density evolution ( ldde ) as outlined in hms05 .",
    "pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) overpredicts especially the lf behavior at high redshift , @xmath12 .",
    "shell @xmath13 is overplotted in each panel for reference . dotted and dashed lines give best  fit ple and ldde models.,width=340 ]",
    "an alternative plot to analyse the data is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : sp - dens - ev ] : data are divided into luminosity classes and plotted over redshift . the plot clearly demonstrates the space density evolution for each luminosity class , i.e. compares low  luminosity agn ( llagn ) to high  luminosity agn ( hlagn).the essential and surprising result is that the space density of hlagn peaks at significantly higher redshift , @xmath0 , i.e. earlier cosmic times , than the llagn that peak at @xmath1 . in other words",
    ": luminous quasars formed first and the bulk of faint agn such as low ",
    "luminosity seyferts came significantly later on the cosmic stage .    .",
    "dashed horizontal blue lines correspond to the maximum contribution of unidentified sources.,width=340 ]    another remarkable fact is that for the first time the high  redshift decline in all luminosity classes with @xmath14\\right)\\lesssim 45 $ ] is shown . at higher luminositites insufficient statistics",
    "does not allow to derive secure trends .",
    "space density evolution can also be studied using optically selected agn type1 as demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite using data sets from the 2df and 6df qso redshift surveys .",
    "a comparison of an optical ( uv ) vs. a x  ray selection of agn type1 is elaborated in h04 .",
    "the main result is that there is relatively little difference in space density evolutions between the two wave bands ; however , we have to consider that ( as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp - dens - ev ] ) rise and fall of the space density is _ x  ray luminosity dependent_. therefore , comparisons of this kind are only preliminary and have to be re  analysed when larger samples of high  redshift x  ray selected qsos are available . + a fruitful comparison is based on analysing flux correlations between optical and x  ray fluxes .",
    "the x  ray data from h04 and optical sdss data from @xcite are considered .",
    "then , the x  ray flux in the soft 0.5 - 2 kev band is plotted over optical @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "the first result is that the x  ray multi ",
    "cone survey covers a significantly wider range . due to these better preconditions",
    ", a tight correlation was discovered by h04 .",
    "plotting the source s luminosity in the same filters indicate an essential difference : the luminosities in x ",
    "rays vs. those in redshifted 2500 @xmath16 _ scale linearly _ , @xmath17 , when using x  ray selected data . but the correlation is non  linear , @xmath18 , when uv data are used .",
    "a preliminary interpretation of this discrepancy are sample selection effects .",
    "host galaxy contamination corrections that are missing in the x  ray analysis are likely to be not responsible for the difference as @xmath19 value studies indicate ( for details see h04 ) .",
    "the analysis of x - ray deep field data by using xlfs and luminosity  weighted space density evolutions provide new clues for our understanding of agn evolution in general and black hole growth in particular .",
    "agn luminosity is connected to the central smbh via eddington s relation .",
    "hence , from the observed activity the black hole mass can be estimated .",
    "concerning hlagn the soft x ",
    "ray selected samples clearly trace the rise and fall of quasars .",
    "the most luminous objects emerge firstly , grow rapidly by accretion and survive as supermassive dark remnants in the local universe . today , we observe these smbhs in the centers of massive galaxy clusters such as m87 in the virgo cluster .",
    "this scenario gets support from theoretical simulations presented recently by @xcite : in hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation on large scales performed in a cube with @xmath20 700 mpc size , the evolution of cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos are followed from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "it has been shown that the observed large scale structure with superclusters surrounded by smaller clusters can be reproduced .",
    "furthermore , the simulations strongly suggest that the most massive black holes with @xmath23 can be found in the centers of the most massive clusters .",
    "these are the descendants of the most active accretors in the quasar era at @xmath0 .",
    "x - ray deep field data from the soft band now suggest an _ anti  hierarchical growth _ of black holes : the most massive black holes with @xmath24 formed first and the bulk of the lighter black holes with @xmath25 formed later .",
    "this behaviour is totally unexpected and not predicted by standard cdm structure formation scenarios which are hierarchical .",
    "maybe this observational fact hints for two accretion modes that differ in accretion efficiency ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a self  consistent model which explains both , anti  hierarchical black hole growth and the local black hole mass function derived from the @xmath26 relation assuming two accretion modes has been suggested recently by @xcite .",
    "concretely , two accretion modes can be established by a varying value of efficiency @xmath27  the parameter in accretion theory that controls conversion of mass flux into radiation flux .",
    "black hole angular momentum controles crucially the efficiency : it is rather low , @xmath28 , for schwarzschild black holes , or high , @xmath29 , for kerr black holes as has been found by @xcite .",
    "the sxlfs that give rise to an early quasar era in combination with the evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) also provide new clues to the so  called _ hen  egg problem _",
    "i.e. if galaxies or the smbhs came first in the universe .",
    "the history of global cosmic star formation has been determined using hubble deep field ( hdf ) observations ( see @xcite ) corrected for dust obscuration following @xcite .",
    "the resulting sfr as function of redshift shows only a moderate variation with cosmic time with a possible peak around a redshift of unity and a steep decline towards lower redshifts .",
    "but the agn population reveals a pronounced peak at significantly higher redshifts as shown in the sxlf of agn type1 .",
    "this discrepancy indicates that the bulk of smbhs have been in place _ before _ the bulk of stars in these galaxies formed .",
    "+ very recently , an analysis of the specific sfr ( ssfr ) i.e. the star formation rate per unit stellar mass , has been presented based on fors deep field ( fdf ) and goods  s field data , see @xcite .",
    "their main finding is that the most massive galaxies with stellar masses around @xmath30 are in quiescent state for @xmath31 but that the ssfr is increased by a factor of @xmath32 10 for redshifts @xmath33 .",
    "this is interpreted as a very early formation epoch of most massive galaxies as supported by the millennium simulation ( @xcite ) and x ",
    "ray deep field observations ( hms05 ) . comparisons of deep field observations therefore allow for attractive solutions of the hen  egg problem .",
    "in this section the analysis with soft x - ray data of about 1000 agn type1 are compared to other work .",
    "@xcite analysed the hard x  ray luminosity functions ( hxlfs ) of bright agn using _ asca _ data .",
    "this hard x  ray selected sample is highly complete ( @xmath32 95% ) and consists of both , agn type1 and type2 , comprising @xmath20 230 sources .",
    "the main feature is that the fraction of type2 agn decreases with intrinsic luminosity or in other words : the space density of obscured agn is luminosity  dependent . a possible explanation for this trend may be due to clean  out effects because the luminous agn core may blow away the dusty torus at the pc ",
    "scale by radiation .",
    "luminosity cores are not strong enough to initiate such a decay of the mass reservoir .",
    "therefore , the agn classification scheme into type1 and type2 is not only a pure orientation effect but is also dependent on agn luminosity . as outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : xlf ] the sxlfs strongly suggest a ldde .",
    "interestingly , the hard x  ray selected sample by @xcite demonstrates the same behaviour .",
    "there is only a difference in the normalization by a factor of five  probably due to absorbed objects missing in the sxlf .",
    "another soft and hard x  ray selected sample based on _ chandra _ ( _ cdf ",
    "n , cdf  s , clasxs _ ) and _ asca _ data has been presented recently by @xcite .",
    "their results are in good agreement with the sxlf analysis presented here , but they still suffer from substantial identification incompleteness .",
    "their agn type1 sample does not directly compare to the one discussed here because @xcite only include optically classified agn type1 ( broad  line agn ) but miss most of llagn type1 that are considered here .",
    "a critical comparison of all available xlfs from different observations will be the topic of an upcoming paper .",
    "+ recently it turned out that there is a possible new population of star  forming galaxies that can be found especially at very low fluxes , @xmath34 as discovered by @xcite .",
    "upcoming x  ray selected samples will have to account for this special class by lowering the flux limits .",
    "in general , x  ray deep fields prove valuable tools to investigate the formation and evolution history of galaxies , in particular of agn . concerning agn ,",
    "x  ray data sets can not stand alone ; they need additional support from optical identification programmes that discriminate type1 vs. type2 and deliver redshift determinations by spectroscopic or photometric techniques .",
    "then , the analysis follows two branches : samples are constructed from soft and/or hard x  ray energy bands . to date soft x",
    " ray selected samples provide high  quality data samples with high degrees of completeness .",
    "hard x  ray selected samples still suffer from lacking spectroscopic identification .",
    "there is much work to be done in the future to resolve the high  energy xrb branch into discrete sources . nevertheless , the comparison of the results from soft ( hms05 ) and soft plus hard x  ray selected samples by @xcite and @xcite agree well so far . + the principal method to analyse x  ray samples are based on deriving xlfs , space density evolution and luminosity density evolution .",
    "the sxlf sample presented here strongly suggests dramatically different evolutionary paths of llagn and hlagn : most luminous quasars formed significantly earlier as the space density peak at @xmath35 demonstrates .",
    "the bulk of galaxies with low luminosities such as seyferts perform later with a space density peak at @xmath36 . linking agn luminosiy to black hole mass via the eddington criterion",
    ", one immediately arrives at the finding that the growth of smbhs is anti  hierarchical : the most massive holes form first .",
    "a comparison with the sfr evolution even shows that the most massive holes formed before the bulk of first stars formed .",
    "hence , deep field observation have the power to solve the cosmological hen  egg problem .",
    "the observed agn evolution scenario should gain support from theoretical simulations .",
    "the millennium simulation is one essential cornerstone that allows to predict the evolution of the large scale structure .",
    "+        the next observational steps are to collect better data i.e. identify more sources , perform deeper pencil beams and adjust suitable flux limits .",

    "there are commitments from _ vla , vlt , subaru _ and _ xmm  newton _ so that there will be also radio to x  ray data available for the same field where more than two million sources are supposed to be detected .",
    "main goals of _ cosmos _ are to study the large scale structure ( lss ) , evolution of galaxies , agn and dark matter haloes , to investigate the sfr , and to derive agn activity as function of morphology , size , redshift and lss environment .",
