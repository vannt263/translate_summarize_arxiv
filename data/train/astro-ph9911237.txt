    "the determination of helium abundances in stars has been a long - standing problem in astronomy . for the old stars in globular clusters and in the galactic halo ,",
    "it is only possible to spectroscopically measure the helium abundance in a direct way for hot horizontal branch ( hb ) stars .",
    "studies of this kind ( e.g. moehler , heber , & durell 1997 ; moehler , heber , & rupprecht 1997 ) have found abundances significantly higher _ and _ lower than the primordial helium abundance determined from observations of low - metallicity extragalactic h ii regions ( e.g. @xmath5 from olive , skillman , & steigman 1997 ) .",
    "the interpretation typically given for the low helium abundances is that gravitational settling has acted preferentially on helium atoms in the atmospheres of these stars , rendering the measurements unusable for determining the initial helium abundance of the stars .",
    "high helium abundances may be the result of mass loss before the hb phase , which could remove most of the hydrogen - rich envelope of the stars .",
    "indirect methods must be used to measure the helium abundance in earlier phases of stellar evolution .",
    "the most useful methods are applied to globular clusters because individual clusters provide us with large samples of stars with seemingly identical compositions and ages .",
    "globular cluster stars also seem to be among the oldest that can be found in the galaxy , so that if the helium abundance could be determined , it would give us a hint of the primordial helium abundance .",
    "there are two other reasons for examining the helium abundances of globular clusters .",
    "first , it is important to look at the overall trend in the helium abundance as a function of the cluster metal content .",
    "this provides a check of our understanding of nucleosynthesis and galactic evolution .",
    "in addition , previous studies of rr lyrae stars have indicated that an anticorrelation of helium abundance with metal content can explain the sandage period - shift effect ( sandage 1982 ) .",
    "second , it is important to see if it is possible to detect helium variations among clusters of similar metallicity , since helium remains a plausible candidate for the `` second parameter '' determining the morphology of the hb . while age seems to play a role in some clusters , it appears to be inadequate to explain all of the variations seen . in the past",
    ", clusters have been marked as possibly having high helium abundances ( e.g. , dickens 1972 ) , but to date there has not been definitive evidence of a relative helium abundance difference .",
    "we will examine three different helium abundance indicators that can be measured from cluster photometry .",
    "we do this in the hopes that anomalous clusters will appear with unusual values in two or more of the parameters , so as to provide better evidence for variations .",
    "a cursory examination of older tabulations of data reveals an additional reason for recomputing values for these indicators : the trend of helium abundance with metallicity appears to depend on the method used ( caputo & castellani 1983 ) .",
    "the three indicators have been discussed to varying degrees in earlier studies : @xmath6 ( iben 1968 ; buzzoni et al 1983 ; caputo , martinez roger , & paez 1987 ) , @xmath3 ( caputo , cayrel , & cayrel de strobel 1983 ; hereafter , ccc ) , and @xmath2 ( carney 1980 ; ccc ) .",
    "photometric studies of globular clusters have become rather numerous in the past decade , so that the size and quality of the dataset for each parameter can be considerably increased . where it has been possible , we have also analyzed data for old globular clusters in the magellanic clouds , and for stars in local group dwarf spheroidals with old populations .    in the following sections , we discuss each parameter in turn  their definitions , the datasets , potential errors in measurement , and calibration . in the final two sections , we compare helium abundance values derived from the different indicators , and",
    "examine the evidence for trends as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "for all three of the indicators discussed below , higher values imply higher helium abundances .",
    "this indicator is simply defined as the ratio @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of horizontal branch stars , and @xmath9 is the number of rgb stars brighter than the luminosity level of the hb .",
    "this primarily reflects the dependence of the hydrogen - burning shell s progress on the hydrogen content of the envelope material being fed into it ( and to a lesser extent , the change of helium core mass at helium flash , which affects the hb luminosity , and hence , the hb lifetime ) .",
    "because the ratio is computed using the brightest stars in each cluster , it can be calculated for any cluster having deep enough photometry . however , because these stars are relatively scarce in globular clusters , it usually requires wide - field data , or accurate photometry of the cluster core .",
    "we have restricted our sample to those clusters with photometric samples of at least a total of 100 hb and rgb stars .",
    "in addition , we require photometry of sufficient quality to separate the hb , rgb , and agb populations readily , and to eliminate field stars from the sample when proper motion data is not available .    we have chosen to use the ratio @xmath6 rather than the similar ratio @xmath10 , which would be more easily measured in most cases , because @xmath6 is more straightforward to calculate theoretically .",
    "for this reason , the stellar sample was sometimes restricted in radius in order to remove portions of the cluster center where image blending made identifications of hb , rgb , and hb stars difficult .    in",
    "re - examining the determinations of @xmath6 , we found that the vast majority of earlier calculations used the `` average '' differential bolometric correction @xmath11 of 0.15 mag to determine the faint end of the rgb sample .",
    "this value was used in the original buzzoni et al .",
    "( 1983 ) paper , but only because uncertainties of various sorts made the correction unimportant .",
    "however , the correction is actually a function of metallicity , and it is applied to the faint end of the rgb sample , which means it can be the source of significant systematic error .    to update @xmath12 , we have examined the hb models of dorman ( 1992 ) in conjunction with the isochrones of bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ; hereafter bv92 ) .",
    "these stellar models were computed with a consistent set of physics and compositions .",
    "although the composition is somewhat out of date ( it does not include full @xmath13-element enhancement ) , the differential bolometric corrections should be satisfactory because they are differential in nature , and the oxygen abundance does not affect the color of the giant branch relative to the instability strip . we have determined the corrections as a function of [ fe / h ] , and have derived the following fitting formula : @xmath14 } + 0.229 \\mbox{[m / h]}^{2 } + 0.034 \\mbox{[m / h]}^{3 } .\\ ] ] because @xmath13-element enhancements influence the position of the hb and rgb in the cmd like a change in [ fe / h ] ( salaris , chieffi , & straniero 1993 ) , they must be taken into account when computing [ m / h ] .",
    "to do so , we assumed a constant @xmath13-element enhancement of 0.3 dex for all of the globular clusters examined ( carney 1996 ) .",
    "[ the halo field population is believed to show a different abundance pattern as a function of metallicity ( wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 ) . ] the @xmath13-element abundance was taken to contribute to the effective metal content of the cluster as 0.7 [ @xmath13/fe ] ( salaris , chieffi , & straniero 1993 ) .",
    "the contribution does not go directly as [ @xmath13/fe ] because oxygen , the most abundant @xmath13 element , has a relatively high ionization potential . as a result",
    ", it does not contribute as significantly to the opacity in the envelope of rgb stars as it does for higher temperature hb stars .",
    "error in observed @xmath6 values comes from two sources : error in the numbers of hb and rgb stars due to misidentification or poisson fluctuations , and error in the determination of the faint limit for the rgb sample ( resulting from the determination of the magnitude level of the hb , or the metallicity uncertainty that affects the size of the differential bolometric correction ) .",
    "the magnitude level of the hb was taken to be the average magnitude of stars in the instability strip . for clusters with many well - studied rr lyrae stars , this",
    "could be taken from the average magnitude of the variables . often though the rr lyrae stars were not observed frequently enough to derive good average magnitudes .",
    "if the cluster had populated red and blue edges of the intability strip , a linear interpolation between the edges was made . in cases where the cluster had only a populated red or blue hb ,",
    "a theoretical correction was made using the models of dorman ( 1992 ) to @xmath15 using the cluster reddening and a well - determined point on the populated portion of the hb .",
    "dorman s scaled - solar abundance hb models were used with a correction for enhanced @xmath13-element abundances as described above .",
    "an examination of the table indicates that the quoted errors for the hb magnitudes for the clusters are in general less than 0.05 mag .",
    "this is because we are not interested in the _ absolute _ value of @xmath16 for any of the clusters  only the value for the sample used .",
    "it is clearly unnecessary for the photometric calibration of the sample to be perfect , since we only require that the relative photometry of the hb and rgb be good enough that the faint limit of the rgb sample can be determined well . for this reason ,",
    "the tabulated values of @xmath16 should not be taken as being good absolute values .",
    "this column is provided to make verification of the results easier .",
    "the error due to the differential bolometric correction is illustrative , so we present a semi - analytic model for its contribution to the error . the important quantity to compute is @xmath17 .",
    "this can be derived assuming that i ) the differential luminosity function ( lf ) of the rgb has a constant slope @xmath18 , and ii ) the number of red giant branch stars goes to zero at the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) .",
    "so , we use @xmath19 , and find @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normalization of the luminosity function . from this",
    "we find @xmath22 n_{rgb } .\\ ] ] the fraction in brackets is close to one , and from bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) lfs we find @xmath23 nearly independent of composition . from this",
    "we find that for each tenth of a magnitude added to the faint limit of the rgb sample , the number of rgb stars increases by about 9% .",
    "( alternately , making the faint limit fainter by one magnitude for a given cluster area increases the total number of red giants by approximately 85% . )",
    "this demonstrates the importance of accurate values for the differential bolometric correction @xmath12 .",
    "the above derivative affects the error in @xmath9 through errors in metallicity and in the determination of the hb magnitude . because of the metallicity dependence of the differential bolometric correction , helium determinations for high metallicity clusters will be relatively more uncertain",
    "a polynomial fit to the derivative gives @xmath24 } + 0.0257\\mbox{[m / h]}^{2 } .\\ ] ] we note that the error from this source goes as @xmath9 , whereas the poisson counting errors go as @xmath25 .",
    "we have used [ fe / h ] values from the tabulation of djorgovski ( 1993 ) in computing the values of @xmath12 for the clusters .",
    "djorgovski s values fairly closely follow the values of zinn & west ( 1984 ; hereafter , zw ) .",
    "we have also considered an alternative metallicity scale since this affects the differential bolometric corrections .",
    "using metallicities from carretta & gratton ( 1996 ) , we recomputed the @xmath6 values for 16 clusters from their sample .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ratcomp ] . for the most part ,",
    "the values were little affected by the changes in the scale .",
    "computed @xmath6 values are insensitive to factors that merely shift the rgb in temperature or color ( age , for example ) .",
    "factors that cause changes in the absolute brightness of the hb ( such as mean mass of the helium cores of stars , and cno abundances ) will cause systematic errors in measured values for individual clusters .",
    "our sample is composed of 42 galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) and 5 globulars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and is presented in table  [ tratio ] .",
    "the listings are grouped in bins of approximately 0.2 in [ fe / h ] .",
    "references carrying a `` ( pm ) '' designation were used to remove field stars from the sample using proper motion information .",
    "there tend to be few clusters at the very metal - rich end due to a combination of substantial field star contamination and confusion between rgb and red hb cluster stars .",

    "brocato , castellani , & villante ( 1998 ) suggest that the uncertainties in the rate of the @xmath137c(@xmath138)@xmath139o reaction lead to an uncertainty in the derived helium abundance of about 0.02 .",

    "this kind of scenario would mean that the helium abundances measured by this method ( as well as those using hb stars in some way ) would be affected since some of the helium produced by the hydrogen - burning shell would be mixed into the envelope of the stars that undergo the process .",

    "if we reduce the metallicity of all clusters by 0.21 dex ( equivalent to ignoring @xmath13 elements ) , we derive a best - fit slope of @xmath143  a change in sign .",
    "thus , the dependence of helium abundance on [ fe / h ] ( in addition to the absolute helium abundance ) as derived from @xmath2 will not be certain until the absolute metallicity scale is improved .",
    "the data from the @xmath3 indicator for the two oosterhoff groups are individually consistent with constant helium abundance as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "it is unlikely that the difference in between the two groups is due to a difference in helium abundance since a similar jump does not appear in the other indicators .    to explain the apparent difference in @xmath3 values between oosterhoff groups",
    ", there must either be some combination of a mean luminosity or a mean mass difference between the rr lyrae stars in the two groups .",
    "if the difference were entirely due to a difference in mean mass , there would be no observable effect in either the @xmath2 or @xmath6 indicators . if there was only a difference in the mean luminosity ( the oo ii clusters rr lyraes would have to be about 15% more luminous than",

    ", we have no evidence for helium abundance differences between the groups , but the small numbers of clusters with @xmath2 values makes this a weak comparison .    the difference in mean @xmath3 value between the groups corresponds to a difference in the mean rr lyrae mass of approximately 20% .",
    "this is not so large as to make it unreasonable that there might be differences in the amount of mass loss at the tip of the rgb between the two groups .",
    "the observations require the oosterhoff ii clusters to have variables of lower mass .",
    "this goes in a direction opposite what is needed to explain the hb morphologies of at least some of the clusters .",
    "clearly this does not speak to the exact cause of the oosterhoff dichotomy , but it can give a little guidance on the details of how the dichotomy is brought about .",
    "we begin this section by summarizing what we consider to be the most important results of the surveys tabulated here .    with the corrected differential bolometric corrections ( larger for more metal - rich populations ) ,",
    "we now see no significant evidence for variation in the indicator @xmath6 as a function of metallicity or horizontal branch type .",
    "in particular , metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath148 ) galactic globular clusters now are more consistent with the mean , and galactic bulge fields ( minniti 1995 ) are also likely to show lower helium abundances .",
    "however , only a handful of clusters have helium values @xmath136 consistent with the favored primordial value @xmath149 .",
    "there is evidence that there is real scatter in the @xmath6 values , over and above what can be chalked up to measurement errors .",
    "clusters with anomalously high ( m30 , m62 , and ngc 6752 ) and low ( m68 , m107 , ngc 5927 , ngc",
    "6229 , and ngc 6624 ) values appear over a range of metallicity .    for @xmath3 , we find that virtually all of the oosterhoff i clusters ( and the lmc cluster reticulum ) have values consistent with a constant helium abundance .",
    "the oosterhoff ii clusters with the largest number of rr lyrae variables also appear to have a constant value ( as do the ursa minor and carina dwarf spheroidals , and the lmc globular cluster ngc 1841 ) .",
    "the remaining lmc globular clusters , and the dwarf spheroidals draco and sextans have values slightly above the average for the oo i group . for the richest oo ii systems , evolution is unable to explain the numbers of rr lyrae variables , and a systematic offset in helium abundance also seems unlikely given the evidence from the other two indicators .",
    "the lack of any correlation between hb type and is indication that the second parameter problem is completely independent from the oosterhoff dichotomy .",
    "the @xmath3 measurements give us the best constraint on the chemical evolution parameter @xmath150 . using the @xmath151 error bar on the slope of the @xmath3  [ fe / h ] relation ,",
    "we get a limit @xmath152 , which is consistent with measurements from extragalactic hii regions ( pagel et al .",
    "1992 ) .    for @xmath2 ,",
    "our results are consistent with constant helium abundance across the range of metallicity sampled .",
    "the absolute value of the helium abundance as well as the exact value of @xmath153})$ ] depend on the metallicity scale used .",
    "the most discrepant clusters can potentially be explained by errors in the cluster reddenings .    comparing data from different indicators",
    ", we find that the mean trends are all consistent with constant helium abundance for metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath154 . we have examined the three indicators so as to use the information to either bolster or dispute claims of unusual helium abundance from just one indicator . in examining the clusters with helium abundances from more than one indicator",
    ", we have not found convincing evidence that any have abnormal helium abundances .",
    "systematic effects clearly appear to varying degrees in the data for all three indicators , but we have not been able to determine the cause in all cases .",
    "we must note that none of the three indicators we have tabulated has much data covering the most metal - rich clusters where evidence of helium enrichment may still reside .",
    "in general , the photometry for these clusters is most subject to field star contamination and heavy reddening , making interpretation difficult . for @xmath6 , there is the additional problem that the red hb begins to overlap the rgb in the cmd , making clean values impossible .",
    "the redness of the hb also tends to preclude the possibility of rr lyrae stars , and hence the possibility of computing @xmath3 .",
    "reddening and difficulties in finding the true hb level makes @xmath2 values unlikely without considerable work .",
    "other means must be devised to determine good helium abundances for these clusters .",
