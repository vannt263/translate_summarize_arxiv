    "a bouncing universe with an initial contraction to a non - vanishing minimal radius , then subsequent an expanding phase provides a possible solution to the singularity problem of the standard big bang cosmology . for a successful bounce , it can be shown that within the framework of the standard 4-dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology with einstein gravity the null energy condition ( nec ) is violated for a period of time around the bouncing point . moreover , for the universe entering into the hot big bang era after the bouncing , the eos of the matter content @xmath0 in the universe must transit from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "the quintom model @xcite , proposed to understand the behavior of dark energy with an eos of @xmath2 in the past and @xmath1 at present , has been supported by the observational data@xcite .",
    "quintom is a dynamical model of dark energy .",
    "it differs from the cosmological constant , quintessence , phantom , k - essence and so on in the determination of the cosmological evolution .",
    "a salient feature of the quintom model is that its eos can smoothly cross over @xmath3 . in the recent years",
    "there has been a lot of proposals for the quintom - like models in the literature . in this paper",
    "we study the bouncing solution in the universe dominated by the quintom matter and working with three specific models we will show explicitly the analytical and numerical solutions of the bounce .",
    "we will start with a detailed examination on the necessary conditions required for a successful bounce . during the contracting phase , the scale factor @xmath4 is decreasing ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath5 , and in the expanding phase we have @xmath6 . at the bouncing point , @xmath7 , and around this point @xmath8 for a period of time .",
    "equivalently in the bouncing cosmology the hubble parameter @xmath9 runs across zero from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the bouncing point .",
    "a successful bounce requires around this point , @xmath13 from ( [ bccong ] ) one can see that @xmath1 in a neighborhood of the bouncing point .",
    "after the bounce the universe needs to enter into the hot big bang era , otherwise the universe filled with the matter with an eos @xmath1 will reach the big rip singularity as what happens to the phantom dark energy@xcite .",
    "this requires the eos of the matter to transit from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the bouncing solutions in the quintom models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the analytical and numerical solutions for different types of models of the quintom matter .",
    "specifically we consider three models : i)a phenomenological quintom fluid with a parameterized eos crossing the cosmological constant boundary ; ii)the two - field models of quintom matter with one being the quintessence - like scalar and another the phantom - like scalar ; iii ) a single scalar with a born - infeld type action .",
    "iii is the summary of the paper .",
    "we start with a study on the possibility of obtaining the bouncing solution in a phenomenological quintom matter described by the following eos : @xmath14 in ( [ paratachyon ] ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 are parameters and we require that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "one can see from ( [ paratachyon ] ) that @xmath0 runs from negative infinity at @xmath19 to the cosmological constant boundary at @xmath20 and then crosses this boundary .",
    "assuming that the universe is dominated by the matter with the eos given by ( [ paratachyon ] ) , we solve the friedmann equation and obtain the corresponding evolution of hubble parameter @xmath21 and scale factor @xmath4 as follows , @xmath22 here we choose @xmath19 as the bouncing point and normalize @xmath23 at this point .",
    "one can see that our solution provides a picture of the universe evolution with contracting for @xmath24 , and then bouncing at @xmath19 to the expanding phase for @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1parahw ] we plot the evolution of the eos , the hubble parameter and the scale factor .    , the hubble parameter @xmath9 and the scale factor @xmath26 as a function of the cosmic time @xmath27 .",

    "[ fig:1parahw ] that a non - singular bouncing happens at @xmath19 with the hubble parameter @xmath9 running across zero and a minimal non - vanishing scale factor @xmath26 . at the bouncing point",
    "@xmath0 approaches negative infinity .",
    "having presented the bouncing solution with the phenomenological quintom matter , we now study the bounce in the scalar field models of quintom matter .",
    "however it is not easy to build a quintom model theoretically .",
    "the no - go theorem proven in ref .",
    "@xcite ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) forbids the traditional scalar field model with a lagrangian of general form @xmath30 to have its eos cross over the cosmological constant boundary .",
    "therefore , to realize a viable quintom field model in the framework of einstein s gravity theory , it needs to introduce extra degree of freedom to the conventional theory with a single scalar field .",
    "the simplest quintom model involves two scalars with one being the quintessence - like and another the phantom - like @xcite .",
    "this model has been studied in detail later on in the literature . in the recent years",
    "there have been a lot of activities in the theoretical study on quintom - like models such as a single scalar with high - derivative @xcite , vector field@xcite , extended theory of gravity@xcite and so on , see e.g. @xcite .    in this section we consider a two - field quintom model with the action given by @xmath31~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the metric is in form of @xmath32 . here",

    "the eos @xmath0 crosses over the @xmath3 and approaches to negative infinity at the bouncing point . and",
    "due to the oscillatory behavior of the field @xmath33 in the evolution , the eos @xmath0 is also oscillating around bouncing point .     with different potential and model parameters @xmath48 , and for the initial conditions @xmath49 .",

    "this type of models has been considered as a candidate for dark energy , however as shown by the no - go theorem it does not give @xmath0 crossing -1 .",

    "one interesting feature of this model is that it provides the possibility of its eos @xmath0 running across the cosmological constant boundary . in the analytical and numerical studies below to make two parameters ( @xmath60 , @xmath55 ) dimensionless , it is convenient to redefine @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath45 is an energy scale of the effective theory of tachyon .    from ( [ tachyonaction ] )",
