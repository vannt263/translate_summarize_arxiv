    "in the last years there has been a growing interest in the understanding a vast variety of scale invariant phenomena occurring in nature . experiments and observations indeed suggest that many physical systems develop correlations with power law behaviour both in space and time .",
    "however , the fact that certain structures exhibit fractal and complex properties does not tell us why this happens .",
    "pattern formation , aggregation phenomena , biological systems , geological systems , disordered materials , clustering of matter in the universe and many fields in which scale invariance has been observed as a common and basic feature .    a crucial point to understand is therefore the origin of the general scale - invariance of natural phenomena .",
    "this would correspond to the understanding of the origin of fractal structures from the knowledge of the microscopic physical processes at the basis of these phenomena .    in scale",
    "invariant phenomena , events and information spread over a wide range of length and time scales , so that no matter what is the size of the scale considered one always observes surprisingly rich structures .",
    "these systems , with very many degrees of freedom , are usually so complex that their large scale behaviour can not be predicted from the microscopic dynamics . new types of collective behaviour arise and their understanding represents one of the most challenging areas in modern statistical physics .",
    "the concepts of scaling and power law behavior was introduced to the study of critical phenomena in second order transitions .",
    "the physics of complex systems , however , is new with respect to critical phenomena .",
    "the theory of equilibrium statistical physics is strongly based on the ergodic hypothesis and scale invariance develops at the critical equilibrium between order and disorder . reaching this equilibrium requires the fine tuning of various parameters . in usual critical phenomena",
    "the same exponents that define the onset of magnetization also describe the liquid vapor transition in water .",
    "this strong universality appears to be a characteristic of equilibrium systems . on the contrary the origin of the scale invariance in nature in the rich domain of nonequilibrium systems",
    "is not so well understood .",
    "systems far from equilibrium , do not seem to exhibit the same degree of universality as the fractal dimension can be easily altered by simple changes in the growth process .",
    "this lack of universality is sometimes viewed as a negative element because one is forced to describe specific systems instead of a single universal model .",
    "this is why such a problem can only be investigated using many tools as computer simulations , analytical tools and suitably designed experiments .",
    "while the theoretical activity is focused mainly on monte carlo simulations , it is very important to understand the relations between theory and real experiments .",
    "fractal geometry provided the mathematical framework for the extension of these concepts to a vast variety of natural phenomena .",
    "a principal subject where fractals play an essential role is in the study of self - affine features arising in complex systems with many degrees of freedom , such as of interface growth in disordered systems including percolation properties of fluid displacement in disordered media .",
    "all these models have been extensively studied by computer simulations .",
    "the information generated by these computer experiments brings a visual intuition as a valuable tool in science . in this",
    "respect computer simulations represent an essential method in the physics of these systems , that allow us to design theoretical experiments tested with a computer .",
    "numerical simulations define the basic characteristics of the models and gives a useful path to their theoretical understanding .    from a mathematical point of view the problems explored are particularly difficult because they consist of iterative systems with many degrees of freedom and irreversible dynamics .",
    "very little can be predicted _ a priori _ for systems of this complexity even when sometimes it is not very difficult to pose a model that capture the essential features of the phenomena .",
    "while the great majority of the theoretical activity is based upon toy models it is very important to build a bridge between theory and real experiments and this is another basic task of computer simulations . to do that , it is necessary the development of models more realist and large scale simulations which can be used also in material characterization .",
    "the consequence of this approach is the application of fractal concepts to the solution of particular experimental problems ( oil industry , disordered materials , phase nucleation , crystal growth etc . ) .",
    "the theoretical effort in this field can be separated into phenomenological or scaling theories and microscopic theories . at a phenomenological level scaling theory ,",
    "inspired to usual critical phenomena , has been successfully used .",
    "this is the nexus to the understanding of the results of computer simulations and experiments .",
    "this method allows us to identify the relations between different properties and exponents and to focus on the essential ones .",
    "moreover , it will be useful to gain more insight into the microscopic dynamics that evolves into the macroscopic behavior .",
    "the connection between the microscopic and macroscopic behavior has not been extensively studied .    in this work",

    "the investigation of rough surfaces and interfaces has attracted much attention , for decades , due to its importance in many fields , such as the motion of liquids in porous media , growth of bacterial colonies , crystal growth , etc .",
    "much effort has been done in understanding the processes that induces the roughness in these fields . when a fluid wet a porous medium a nonequilibrium self - affine rough interface is generated .",
    "the interface has been characterized through scaling of the interfacial width @xmath0 ^ 2\\rangle^{1/2}$ ] with time @xmath1 and lateral size @xmath2 .",
    "the result is the determination of two exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 called dynamical and roughness exponents respectively .",
    "the interfacial width follows @xmath5 the crossover time between this two regimes is of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "the disorder affects the motion of the interface and leads to its roughness .",
    "the main disorder proposed has been the `` annealed '' noise that only depends on time and the `` quenched '' disorder due to the inhomogeneity of the media where the moving phase is propagating . while the annealed disorder pushes forward the interface the quenched disorder brakes this advancement .",
    "this last disorder can be due to impurities , fluctuations in the capillary size or it could represent all the effects of an inhomogeneous media .",
    "some experiments such as the motion of liquids in porous media , where the disorder is quenched , are well described by the directed percolation depinning model . some other experiments like the flow of fluid trough a disordered media , where the disorder is also quenched @xcite ,",
    "give roughness exponents scattered between @xmath7 and @xmath8 questioning the existence of universality , the foundation of the scaling hypothesis ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "several fluid - fluid displacement experiments that can be described in terms of simple self - affine structures were motivated by the growing interest of physicians on the dynamics of rough surfaces .",
    "the experiments are easy to perform but the process are very complex to understand .",
    "one of the experiments that was first performed in order to explain the fact that the roughness exponent @xmath4 was not predicted by equations with thermal noise was carried out by rubio _",
    "@xcite in @xmath9 dimensions . in this experiment",
    "the air is displaced by a dyed water in a porous media consisting of glass beads packed randomly into a thin horizontal cell of glass covered with teflon .",
    "the water was injected by one of its edges wetting the porous media and the fluid - fluid interface is digitized .",
    "the roughness exponent was measured over a distance @xmath10 obtaining a value of @xmath11 .",
    "this value does not depend on the bead diameter and the capillary number @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the diameter of the bead , @xmath14 is the velocity of the water and @xmath15 is the interfacial tension . ] in the range that they worked .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the interface of rubio _ et al . _ and obtained @xmath16 .",
    "this discrepancy is not clear , but it could be assign to the sensibility of this exponent to the details of the data analysis . also in this experiment the exponent @xmath17 was obtained .",
    "other value of @xmath18 , where the exponent was measured in the saturation , was obtained by buldyrev _",
    "@xcite with aqueous fluids absorbed in many kind of papers . in these experiments , the scaling value does not depend on the temperature , humidity and kind of paper .",
    "they inferred that the evaporation is irrelevant .",
    "horvth and stanley @xcite performed an experiment in which the evaporation was controlled by confining the paper between two transparent polymer sheets .",
    "the lower end of the cell was immersed on liquid .",
    "the shape of the interface was digitized and the mean height of the interface was calculated in real time in order to maintain it at a fixed height .",
    "this prevents any change in the velocity .",
    "they found @xmath19 .",
    ".measured exponents from experiments [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the scattering between the exponents obtained in these experiments puts in doubt the universality of their results .",
    "sometimes , the uncertainties could be the result of complex crossover behaviors before the asymptotic regime is reached . on the other hand , sometimes , the asymptotic regime is not reached in the experiments . also in many experiments the interval where the exponents were measured is very short enough ( less than two decades ) , in these cases the results obtained are less reliable .",
    "this does not mean that the idea of scaling behaviors must be rejected , moreover some scaling hypothesis must be reviewed . in table",
    "[ tabla1 ] we shows some experimental results .",
    "motivated by the success of the kardar - parisi - zang ( kpz ) @xcite equation in describing the interface motion with thermal noise , it has been proposed that many interfaces in porous media are described by the quenched kpz ( qkpz ) equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 represent the quenched white noise in the media and @xmath22 is the driving force responsible of the advance of the interface .",
    "this equation predicts the existence of a depinning transition : for driving forces @xmath23 the interface is pinned , and for @xmath24 it moves with a velocity @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the velocity exponent and @xmath27 is the reduced force .",
    "numerical studies @xcite indicated that the discrete models can be grouped into two universality classes depending on the behavior of the qkpz nonlinearity @xmath28 .",
    "isotropic models , _",
    "i.e. _ models that have no growth direction determined by the random forces , have @xmath29 or @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "the scaling exponents can be determined analytically , in one dimension , from eq .",
    "( [ qkpz ] ) with @xmath29 , obtaining @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "however , anisotropy can induce a relevant @xmath28 at the depinning transition .",
    "the exponents characterizing this anisotropic universality can be obtained by an exacting mapping to directed percolation , obtaining @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "many numerical simulations have been done from a tilted interface @xcite in order to justify if the nonlinear term of the qkpz is present in the dynamics of the proposed models .",
    "recently rka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite implemented a method that apply to numerical models and experimental data and allows to classify the data into one of the two universality classes without relying on the determination of the exponents .",
    "they assumed that the local velocity has the same scaling behavior than the global velocity @xmath14 , then @xmath38^{\\theta^{'}}$ ] , where @xmath39 is the averaged local velocity of the interface with slope @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the depinning threshold corresponding to these segments , and @xmath42 is the local velocity exponent . in isotropic media @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so the ratio @xmath45 does not depend on the driven force .",
    "in contrast , in anisotropic media the depinning threshold , @xmath41 decreases with @xmath40 and @xmath46 .",
    "so , for anisotropic media @xmath47 has a systematic dependence on @xmath22 .",
    "plotting @xmath48 as a function of @xmath40 for the several models and for the fluid - fluid experiment they concluded that this last experiment belongs to the isotropic class .",
    "all these numerical results confirms the relevance of a nonlinear term for any model but they do not assert to prove if these models are well represented by the qkpz equation or its linear version , the quenched edward - wilkinson ( qew ) @xcite .",
    "in particular in models with quenched noise belonging to the anisotropic class the macroscopic dynamics is influenced by the coupled effect of the interface itself and the disorder as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : ecc ]",
    ".    a powerful method to derive the macroscopic behavior of these models is to attempt to write the microscopic equation for the evolution of the local height in these models .",
    "this is done _ via _ the master equation approach @xcite or directly by writing the microscopic rules for the evolution of the local height @xcite .",
    "these two methods have been proved to be equivalent @xcite .",
    "these microscopic equations that captures the mechanisms of the growth for each model must reproduce the macroscopic behavior of the relevant observable that in this case is the interface itself .",
    "its continuum version , in a coarsed grained scale is the equation that represent its universality class .",
    "let us to introduce the two main models describe the principal features of the experiments of fluid imbibition on paper sheet @xcite .",
    "we present now the microscopic tang and leschhorn ( tl ) model .",
    "the interface growth takes place in a lattice of @xmath49 points of edge @xmath2 ( @xmath50 ) where @xmath13 is the lattice constant . usually in discrete models",
    "@xmath13 is taken as one , so @xmath51 .",
    "we will retain the lattice constant because we will use it below .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "the quenched noise is represented by a random pinning force @xmath52 uniformly distributed in @xmath53 $ ] assigned to every cell of the lattice .",
    "this random force models the random distribution of the fiber of paper . for a given pressure @xmath54 , that represents the driving force that push the fluid into the media ,",
    "the cells are divided in two groups , active ( free ) cells with @xmath55 and inactive ( blocked ) cells with @xmath56 .",
    "notice that @xmath57 is the density of blocked cells .",
    "it is well known that there exist a critical density of blocked cells @xmath58 , what is the directed percolation threshold for an infinite lattice , above @xmath59 the interface becomes pinned .    in this model ,",
    "the growth event is defined as follow :    1 .",
    "if @xmath60 is greater than either @xmath61 or @xmath62 by one or more units , the height of the lower of the two columns @xmath63 and @xmath64 is incremented in @xmath13 ( in case of tie , one of the two is chosen with equal probability ) .",
    "2 .   in the opposite case , @xmath65 ,",
    "the column @xmath66 advances by one unit provided that the cell to be occupied is an active cell .",
    "3 .   otherwise no growth takes place .    in this model , the time unit is defined as one growth attempt . in numerical simulations at each growth attempt the time @xmath1 is increased by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .    notice that the condition for the interface becomes pinned is that :    * @xmath69 and * all the sites above the interface are blocked .",
    "so , the interface becomes pinned if a cluster of inactive sites connected horizontally or diagonally expands all the lattice .",
    "this happens for @xmath70 .",
    "this define a cluster of directed percolation . for @xmath71",
    "the interface is characterized by two correlations lengths that behave approaching to the critical point as , @xmath72 which are the characteristic lengths of these clusters in both directions , with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the interface is specified by a set of integer column heights @xmath60 ( @xmath75 ) . during the growth ,",
    "a column is selected at random with probability @xmath76 and compared its height with those of its neighbors . in a temporal step the height in the site @xmath66",

    "the cross mechanism between both contributions is not taken into account in this equation because the noise is additive .",

    "this explain why this contribution enhances the roughness at the criticality as was predicted by braunstein _",
    "faraway above the criticality the nonlinear term becomes less relevant . in the limit @xmath170 ( @xmath171 )",
    "we recover the kpz ( ew ) equation with thermal noise as was expected . in the asymptotic regime ( @xmath172 ) the various derivatives of the height",
    "become very small on a coarse grained scale . in this temporal regime the mean height speed ( mhs ) @xmath173 . for @xmath174 , @xmath175 and",
    "the mhs goes to zero while for @xmath176 , @xmath177 and mhs goes to constant .",
    "notice that our equation is invariant under local tilting of the interface by an infinitesimal angle in the same way that the qkpz equation ( [ qkpz ] ) is @xcite , so the previous numerical results obtained by amaral _",
    "@xcite , that studied the effects of the effective coefficient @xmath178 from a tilted interface , are compatible with our equation .",
    "our result is also in agreement with those of rka _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that obtained numerically a parabolic shape of the local velocity as a function of the gradient for the dpd model near above the criticality for different reduced forces @xmath179 .    in the experiments ,",
    "the advancement of the interface is determinated by the coupled effect of the random distribution of the capillary sizes , the surface tension and the local properties of the flow , so it is not surprising that all these effect give rise to a multiplicative noise .",
    "this multiplicative noise must be taken into account at the time to pose a model with the essential features of the experiment of surface growth in disordered media . in the tl and the buldyrev _",
    "_ models the growing rules for the evolution of the local height are strongly coupled to the quenched noise in a multiplicative way . in both models the microscopic rules that allows the growth from an unblocked cell",
    "@xcite depends in some way on the local slope . in that sense",
    "this coupled effect is not taken into account in the qkpz equation .",
    "the effect of a multiplicative noise has been proposed by csahk _",
    "_ @xcite by means of a phenomenological equation .",
    "they found a crossover between two temporal regimes with @xmath180 to @xmath181 but the value of @xmath182 was obtained over a short range spatial scale .",
    "indeed , the exponents are not the same as of the dpd models .",
    "moreover , processes with the same exponent may not belong to the same universality class .",
    "for example , @xmath9-dimensional lattice gas simulations of roughening of immiscible fluid - fluid interface @xcite lead to the same exponents as the @xmath9-dimensional kpz @xcite ( @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) for surface growth , but this model is completely linear , so there is no obvious mathematical relationship between these two processes .",
    "the microscopic equations for the models with quenched noise , treated in this work , allows to gain a more profound insight on the principal mechanism of growth . in special",
    ", the separation into the lateral and the local growth contributions allows to explain the great interplay between them .",
    "obviously , the continuous equation that represents the local growth of these processes must take into account both mechanisms in addition of the symmetries allowed by the model , but this is not enough to reproduce the interplay between both mechanisms .",
    "the qkpz equation contains a lateral and a local contribution but the quenched noise is additive .",
    "notice that a relevant common feature of the two models treated in this work is that the rules for growth in active sites depend strongly on the slope .",
    "so , it is not surprising that this lead to a coupled effect of the quenched noise to the dynamics .",
    "this coupled effect is not taken into account in any equation with additive noise .",
    "nevertheless , the qkpz equation gives the same scaling exponents that these models , moreover it is not clear why .",
    "our results suggest that the qkpz equation does not describe properly the dynamics of the dpd models even if the exponents are similar .",
    "our langevin equation for the tl model reflects this coupled effect through its coefficient noise dependence .",
    "the equation obtained has the same terms than the qkpz but its coefficient depends on the competition between the driving force and the quenched noise . in that sense , our equation is multiplicative in the noise .",
    "finally , we conclude that the classification of these models in universality classes is not fully developed .",
    "the derivation of the continuous equation from the microscopic dynamics is a powerful method that allows to associate them in a non ambiguous way .",
