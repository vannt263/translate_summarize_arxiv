    "it does not describe the redshift propagation exactly . neglecting the last term in ( [ 3.6 ] ) we have changed the exact equation into one that only approximates the actual variation of @xmath92 along the ray .",
    "the approximation is better the smaller the value of @xmath92 . considering that @xmath92 is the period of an electromagnetic wave , and taking into account the period range of relevance in observational astronomy ( from gamma rays up to radio waves ,",
    "the longest observed of which have the wavelength of the order of 15 m , thus the period of about @xmath104 s ) , we see that , compared to cosmological time - scales , the periods are short indeed and the approximation is not bad .",
    "moreover , as seen from ( [ 3.8 ] ) , by following the rays back from the observation event into the past , we encounter ever smaller values of @xmath92 , so the approximation gets progressively better with increasing redshift ( or , rather , gets progressively worse as the ray approaches us ) .",
    "still , it is conceptually important to remember that ( [ 3.9 ] ) involves an approximation ( this approximation is equivalent to the geometric optics approximation [ 11 , 24 ] that leads to the commonly used expression for the redshift @xmath105 ) .",

    "thus , @xmath515 , which is one of the necessary conditions for the existence of rlps , can in this case be fulfilled only when the szekeres model trivializes to friedmann .",
    "the calculation above was done for @xmath42 .",
    "the calculation with @xmath43 is essentially the same and need not be done separately  it is enough to replace @xmath516 in all equations with @xmath517 .",
    "when @xmath41 , we have necessarily @xmath85 and the calculation must be done separately .",
    "then we have : @xmath518 with the @xmath24-coordinate chosen so that @xmath519 , where @xmath520 is a constant , this simplifies @xmath507 in ( [ g.18 ] ) to @xmath521    now the independent variables are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath23 appears always in the combination @xmath522 .",
    "thus different powers of @xmath522 are linearly independent , and their coefficients must vanish separately .",
    "whichever term we take , except for the last two , the result is always the same : @xmath523 ( because @xmath524 is the vacuum , i.e. schwarzschild , limit of the l ",

    "thus , there are no non - radial rlps also when @xmath41 , which completes the proof in the case @xmath491 .",
    "we go back to ( [ g.15 ] ) , where we assumed @xmath491 and proceed from there on to consider the case @xmath349 . instead of ( [ g.18 ] )",

    "what results is a polynomial of degree 6 in @xmath529 and of degree 3 in @xmath500 .",

    "so we substitute @xmath532 in the main polynomial , and in the resulting expression we take the term independent of @xmath505 . the resulting equation is : @xmath533 the unique solution of this is @xmath512 , which , together with @xmath532 , leads back to the friedmann limit .",
    "thus , no rlps exist in nontrivial szekeres spacetimes in this case , either .",
    "the argument given before , that the result for @xmath43 follows by the substitution @xmath534 , is still valid .",
    "so we now consider @xmath349 with @xmath41 .",
    "we substitute @xmath41 ( and , as is necessary , @xmath85 ) in ( [ g.33 ] ) , multiply the result by @xmath325 , substitute then for @xmath325 and @xmath59 from ( [ g.30 ] ) , and obtain : @xmath535 the coefficients of independent powers of @xmath536 have to vanish separately , as explained before .",
    "whichever term we take , except for the last one , the result is always the same : @xmath537 and this implies the friedmann limit in the same way as explained after ( [ g.32 ] ) .",
    "this also guarantees that the whole of ( [ g.36 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "thus , in every case considered , the assumption that non - radial rlps could exist leads to either the friedmann limit or the schwarzschild limit .",
    "the final conclusion is that the only rlps in the @xmath178 models are the radial null geodesics . @xmath538",
    "the algorithm used in the calculations discussed in sec . [ numex ] consists of following steps :    1 .",
    "first we set the observer at @xmath208 ( the present - day areal distance ) and consider sources which are , at the present instant , away from the observer by 1 gly ( @xmath539 mpc ) .",
    "2 .   to calculate the evolution of the model one needs to follow the following points : * the radial coordinate is chosen to be the areal radius at the present instant : @xmath540 . however , to simplify the notation we will omit the bar and denote the new radial coordinate by @xmath24 . *",
    "the chosen asymptotic cosmic background is an open friedman model , i.e. @xmath541 and @xmath542 .",
    "the background density is then given by + @xmath543 + where the hubble constant is @xmath544 km s@xmath201 mpc@xmath201 .",
    "* the initial time @xmath196 is calculated from the following formula for the background friedman universe + @xmath545 * the age of the universe is assumed to be everywhere the same : @xmath194 . *",
    "the function @xmath14 follows from ( [ 2.5 ] ) , where the present - day density is @xmath546\\ ] ] * because of the assumed spherical symmetry @xmath547 .",
    "* the function @xmath13 can be calculated from ( [ 2.6 ] ) . *",
    "then the evolution of the model can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "we then find a null geodesic that joins the observer and the source .",
    "the angle between the direction towards the source and the direction towards the origin , at the present instant , is denoted as @xmath210 .",
    "the null geodesics are found in the following manner : * because of spherical symmetry we may set one of the angular components of the null vector to zero .",
    "we set @xmath548 .",
    "* the second angular component , @xmath549 , follows from @xmath550 , where @xmath551 , i.e. at the observer s position .",
    "this relation is a consequence of ( [ 4.10 ] ) and ( [ 4.11 ] ) and was derived in @xcite ( see equation ( 3.26 ) in @xcite ) . *",
    "the radial component is evaluated from ( [ 4.8 ] ) with @xmath552 , and @xmath553 . *",
    "the time component of the null vector is found from @xmath554 .",
    "we then find two other null geodesics : one that will reach the observer in 1 gy time , the other one that arrived at the observer s position 1 gy ago . because of the non - rlp effect these geodesics approach the observer at angles that are different from @xmath210 .",
    "the difference between these angles allows us to evaluate the rate of change of the angle @xmath210 .",
