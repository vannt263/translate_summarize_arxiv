    "the knowledge of photosynthetic processes in bacteria and plants may provide us deep insights into designing efficiently and robustly artificial light harvesting systems , where the initial stages in the conversion of solar energy into chemical and other forms of energy can be described by exciton dynamics with trapping and decoherence .",
    "recent experimental and computational studies suggest that environmental noise can assist the exciton transport and can be optimized for maximal energy transfer efficiency@xcite .",
    "in particular , special attention has been focused on the so - called fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex that promotes energy transfer from the main light - harvesting complex towards the chemical reaction center in green sulfur bacteria .    as a small protein in green sulfur bacterium ,",
    "the fmo complex is a highly efficient energy transfer wire that connects chlorosomes(i.e . , light collecting pigment arrays ) to photosynthetic reaction centers . in structure ,",
    "the fmo protein is a trimer , each monomer contains seven bacteriochlorophyll - a ( bchla ) molecules embedded within a protein scaffold and is believed to function independently@xcite .",
    "we shall refer to the individual bchla molecules as sites in this paper .",
    "recent studies have determined the orientation of the fmo complex within the inter - membrane region between the chlorosome antenna and reaction center@xcite , evidence that photosynthetic systems exhibit quantum coherence at ambient temperature has been found , but the significance of these discoveries for biological energy transfer remains unclear .",
    "it is quite certain that the reaction center is strongly coupled to bchla 3 and that the excitation energy enters an fmo monomer from the chlorosomes via bchla 1 or bchla 6 .",
    "although a preliminary understanding of the complex dynamics of excitation transfer has been made , the theory is still in its infancy .",
    "for example , most studies are restricted to one exciton limit and the initial exciton is supposed in only one of the seven sites .",
    "this paper addresses two open questions concerning the relevance of excitonic coherence to photosynthetic energy transfer .",
    "first , we present a theoretical framework which elucidates how decoherence could assist the excitation transfer , we optimize the decoherence rates for maximal transfer efficiency and study the robustness of excitation transfer against the fluctuation of the on - site energy .",
    "second , we present a study on the coherence in the initially excited states by showing the dependence of the transfer efficiency on the initial states .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model to describe the fmo complex and the markovian master equation for the dynamics of the exciton transport . in sec .",
    "iii , we optimize the decoherence rates for maximal excitation energy transfer efficiency and explore how the efficiency depends on the initial state of the fmo . the fluctuations in the local on - site energy and in the site - site couplings affect the transfer efficiency , this effect is studied in sec .",
    "finally , we conclude our results in sec .",
    "in the following , we will briefly introduce the model hamiltonian that we use to describe the fmo complex .",
    "for each site we take two electronic states into account .",
    "since we restrict ourself to a single electronic excitation , the so - called frenkel exciton hamiltonian , @xmath0 can describe the reversible dynamics of the electronic degrees of freedom . here",
    "@xmath1 represents the state where only the @xmath2-th site is excited and all other sites are in their electronic ground state .",
    "@xmath3 is the on - site energy of site @xmath2 , and @xmath4 denotes the excitonic coupling between sites @xmath5 and @xmath2 . in the site basis , we follow ref.@xcite and employ the hamiltonian matrix elements ( in units of @xmath6 ) in the remainder of this paper , @xmath7 here the zero energy has been shifted by 12230 @xmath6 for all sites , corresponding to a wavelength of @xmath8 .",
    "we note that in units of @xmath9 , we have 1 ps@xmath10=5.3 cm@xmath10 . then by dividing @xmath4 and @xmath12 by 5.3 , all elements of the hamiltonian are rescaled in units of ps@xmath10 .",
    "we can find from the hamiltonian @xmath13 that in the fenna - matthew - olson complex ( fmo ) , there are two dominating exciton energy transfer ( eet ) pathways : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "although the nearest neighbor terms dominate the site to site coupling , significant hopping matrix elements exist between more distant sites .",
    "this indicates that coherent transport itself may not explain why the excitation energy transfer is so efficient .",
    "we adopt the spin - boson model to describe the interactions between excitations and surrounding protein environments , @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the coupling constant between site @xmath5 and the mode @xmath2 of the environment .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath18 describes the modulation of on - site energy by the environment in the liner case , where the on - site energy on the dimensionless environment coordinate @xmath19 .",
    "such a site - environment coupling can model the site - vibration interaction , leading to decoherence in the fmo .",
    "this decoherence can be described by the master equation . to derive the master equation",
    ", we adopt the following assumptions .",
    "( 1 ) the time evolution of the whole system ( the fmo + environment ) is unitary , where the full hamiltonian is assumed to be time - independent and consists of three parts , namely the system hamiltonian @xmath13 , the bath hamiltonian @xmath20 and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "the deviation of the master equation is equivalent to finding the dynamics of the fmo by tracing out the degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "this is not always possible and we shall assume that , ( 2 ) the system - environment interaction is sufficiently weak , so that perturbation theory is applicable .",
    "moreover , we assume that , ( 3 ) the whole system is in a product initial state , and ( 4 ) the environment has short memory in the sense that the correlation time is very short .",
    "for details , we refer the readers to ref . @xcite . with these assumptions",
    ", we can derive a master equation to describe the dynamics of the fmo complex , which is given by , @xmath21          + { \\cal l}(\\rho ) + { \\cal l}_{38}(\\rho)\\ ; , \\label{mastere}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the liouvillian takes , @xmath22,\\nonumber\\\\ \\mathcal{l}_{38}(\\rho)&= & \\gamma \\left[p_{83}\\rho(t ) p_{38}-\\frac{1}{2}p_3\\rho(t)-\\frac{1}{2}\\rho(t)p_3\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 @xmath26 describes exciton decoherence due to the site - environment couplings , and @xmath27 characterizes the excitation trapping at site 3 due to interactions with the reaction center , labeled as site 8 .",
    "the presence of this 8th bchl chromophore has been suggested in each subunit of the fmo complex by recent crystallographic data@xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental data and theoretical studies indicated that the 8th bchl is the closest to the baseplate and should be the point at which energy flows into the fmo complex@xcite .",
    "we shall use the population @xmath28 at time @xmath29 in the reaction center given by @xmath30 to quantify the excitation transfer efficiency .",
    "clearly , the liouvillian @xmath31 plays an essential role in the excitation transfer . through this term the decoherence with rates",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33 can enhance the excitation transfer as we show in the next section .",
    "it is believed that the completely coherent dynamics is not most ideal for the excitation transfer , and the quantum coherence itself can not explain the very high excitation transfer efficiency . indeed ,",
    "our numerical simulations show that @xmath34 can be optimized to 87.14 with @xmath35 to obtain the excitation transfer efficiency @xmath36 .",
    "we optimize the decoherence rates @xmath34 and @xmath37 for the maximal excitation energy transfer efficiency , and find that @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 yield a transfer efficiency @xmath41 with these decoherence rates , the population on each site as a function of time is plotted in fig .",
    "two observations can be made from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : ( 1 ) the population shows oscillatory behaviors during the first 0.5ps and then they change in a smooth way , ( 2 ) the excitation on site 1 and 2 dominates the population , while the population at site 3 is almost zero . the first observation can explain why the excitation transfer lasts for longer time than the quantum coherence ( quantum oscillation ) , and the second observation suggests that the site 1 and site 2 play important role in the excitation energy transfer .",
    "the excitation on site 3 is trapped and transferred to the reaction center almost immediately as to obtain a high transfer efficiency , as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows .",
    "spatial and temporal relaxation of exciton shows that the site 1 and 6 were populated initially with larger contribution @xcite .",
    "then it is interesting to study how the initial states affect the excitation transfer efficiency . in the following",
    ", we shall shed light on this issue .",
    "two cases are considered .",
    "first , we calculate the excitation transfer efficiency with exciton initially in a superposition of site 1 and 6 , and study the effect of transfer efficiency on the initial states .",
    "second , we extend this study to initial states where sites 1 and 2 are initially excited .",
    "these calculations are performed by numerically optimized the decoherence rates for maximal transfer efficiency at time @xmath42ps , selected results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , [ fig5 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present the transfer efficiency as a function of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which characterize the pure initial states of the fmo complex through @xmath45 ( upper panel ) and @xmath46 ( lower panel ) .",
    "we find that a properly coherent superposition of sites 1 and 6 ( or 2 ) can enhance the exciton transfer . for exciton",
    "initially in a superposition of 1 and 6 , the transfer efficiency is more sensitive to the population ratio ( characterized by @xmath43 ) but not to the relative phase @xmath44 .",
    "the transfer efficiency arrives at its maximum with @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( it is not unique ) , suggesting that exciton on site 6 is more favorable for the energy transfer .",
    "this finding is changed when the relative phase @xmath44 is not zero , for example , when @xmath49 , the maximal transfer efficiency moves toward larger @xmath43 . for exciton",
    "initially excited on site 1 and 2 , both the population ratio and the relative phase affect the energy transfer , the transfer efficiency reaches its maximum with @xmath50 and @xmath48 and its minimum with @xmath51 and @xmath48 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the dependence of the transfer efficiency on the mixing rate @xmath52 , where the initial state is a classical mixing of site 1 and 6 ( or 2 ) .",
    "obviously , the population mixing favors the transfer efficiency .",
    "in particular , the classical mixing of site 1 and site 6 ( or site 2 ) always increase the transfer efficiency , this is different from the case where the mixing is performed in a different way , see fig .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the transfer efficiency attains a minimal value at @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( upper panel ) which is consistent with the observation emerged from fig .",
    "as @xmath52 decreases , the transfer efficiency increases linearly .",
    "similar features can be found from the lower panel of fig .",
    "these results suggest that the population on site 6 favors the energy transfer : if the mixing of site 6 and site 1 is classical , the transfer efficiency increases linearly with the population on site 6 . otherwise , it depends on the mixing angle @xmath43 and the relative phase @xmath44 .",
    "we would like to note that the coherent superposition of exciton on the sites 1 and 6 ( or 2 ) can help the energy transfer even when the decoherence is absent .",
    "for example , our numerical optimizations show that the transfer efficiency can be increased to 98% starting with an initial state @xmath55 , however , this is not the case for classical mixing ( or incoherent superposition ) of the sites 1 and 2 ( or site 6 ) as initial states .",
    "the transfer efficiency is always smaller than ( or equal to ) 67.81% ( the efficiency in the case with exciton 100% on the site 1 in the absence of decoherence ) with initial states in the form @xmath56 .",
    "this suggests that the transfer enhancement by coherent superposition of exciton on site 1 and site 6 ( or site 2 ) is a common feature for the energy transfer in the fmo complex regardless of the presence of decoherence .",
    "but the enhancement of transfer efficiency by classical mixing works only in the presence of decoherence .",
    "this can be understood as the coherent cancelation or coherent enhancement in the dynamics of exciton transport .",
    "it has been shown that the local decoherence can enhance the transfer efficiency @xcite in the fmo , this can be understood as the fluctuation - induced - broadening of energy levels , which bridges the on - site energy gap and the coupling between them .",
    "this gives rise to the following question : how the fluctuations in the site energies and couplings affect the transfer efficiency . in the following",
    ", we will study this issue and show that the exciton transfer in the fmo complex remains essentially unaffected in the presence of random variations in site energies and inter - site couplings .",
    "this strongly suggests that the experimental results recorded for samples at low temperature would also be observable at higher temperatures .",
    "we take the decoherence rates that maximize the transfer efficiency for the numerical simulation .",
    "two types of fluctuations in the site energies and inter - site couplings are considered . in the first one",
    ", it has zero mean , while the another type of fluctuations has nonzero positive mean . for the fluctuations with zero mean , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ha ] ) takes the following changes , @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the fluctuations with nonzero positive mean , the hamiltonian takes the following changes , @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes a random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "so a 100% static disorder may appear in the on - site energies and inter - site couplings .    with these arrangements , we numerically calculated the transfer efficiency and present the results in fig .",
    "each transfer efficiency is a result averaged over 20 fluctuations .",
    "two observations are obvious .",
    "( 1 ) as the fluctuations with zero - mean in the site energies and couplings increase , the transfer efficiency fluctuates greatly .",
    "( 2 ) for fluctuations with nonzero positive mean , the efficiency increases with @xmath62 but decrease with @xmath63 .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the energy gap between neighboring sites blocks the energy transfer , whereas the inter - site couplings that represent the overlap of different sites favor the transport . as a result of competition ,",
    "the efficiency increases with @xmath63 but decreases with @xmath62 .",
    "for the fluctuation with zero mean , the results are subtle , it depends seriously on each run , and the averaged transfer efficiency remains almost unchanged .",
    "ref.@xcite suggested that the fluctuations in the on - site energies are gaussian . to examine the effect of gaussian fluctuations , we introduce a gaussian function , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mean , while @xmath66 denotes the standard deviation .",
    "furthermore we assume that the fluctuations enter into only the on - site energies , namely , @xmath67 is replaced by @xmath68 , @xmath69 . with these notations , we plot the effect of fluctuations on the transfer efficiency in fig . [ fig9](a ) .",
    "we find that the efficiency is almost independent of the variation , but it decreases as the mean increases .",
    "this again can be understood as the blockage of energy transfer by the energy gap between the neighboring sites . when these gaussian fluctuations occur in both the on - site energies and the couplings , we find from fig.[fig9](b ) that the transfer efficiency increases as the mean increases and the variation decreases .",
    "this is a result of competition between the energy gaps and couplings of the neighboring sites .",
    "some one may wonder about the decoherence rates that yield the high energy transfer efficiency  why the optimal decoherence rate is different for each sites ?",
    "why some decoherence rates are larger than the energy gaps between the sites . as a phenomenal model presented here",
    ", we can not answer these questions , this stimulate further works on this topic .",
    "in this paper , we study the excitation transfer efficiency in light - harvesting complexes , in particular , the fenna - matthew - olson ( fmo ) complex .",
    "this is a problem of long interest , and timely due to the recent activity sparked by suggestions of quantum effects in energy transport .",
    "it is well known that photosynthetic organisms operate at extremely low light levels , and the exciton initially excited in the fmo complex may occupy the site 1 and 6 ( or site 2 ) simultaneously .",
    "this stimulate us to study the effects of initial state on the transfer efficiency . based on the frenkel exciton hamiltonian and the master equation",
    ", we have optimized the decoherence rates for maximal energy transfer efficiency , which can reach about 93% at time 5ps . by considering different mixing of exciton on site 1 and site 6 ( site 2 ) as the initial states",
    ", we have examined the effect of initial states on the energy transfer efficiency .",
    "the results suggest that a classically mixing of site 1 and site 6 ( or site 2 ) always enhance the energy transfer efficiency , whereas a coherent superposition of site 1 and site 6 ( or site 2 ) increases the efficiency only for special initial states .",
