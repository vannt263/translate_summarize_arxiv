    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is a phenomenon that usually occurs for atomic ensemble as an active mechanism to slow down or stop laser pulse completely @xcite .",
    "usually , the eit effect happens in the so - called @xmath1-type atomic system , which contains two lower states with separate couplings to an excited state via two electromagnetic fields ( probe and control light ) .",
    "when the absorption on both transitions is suppressed due to destructive interference between excitation pathways to the upper level , the medium becomes transparent with respect to the probe field .",
    "most recently , an eit - like effect has been displayed in the experiment via all optical on - chip setups with the coupled resonator optical waveguide ( crow ) @xcite .",
    "the bare crow for photons behaves as the tight - binding lattice with band structure for electrons , thus the crow forms a new type photonic crystal .",
    "it was discovered that , by coupling each resonator in the crow to an extra cavity , the resonate spectral line is shift and the band width is compressed , thus the propagating of light pulses is stopped and the information carried by light is stored @xcite .",
    "the scheme of stopping , storing and releasing light is also theoretically proposed and analyzed for quantum - well bragg structures which form a one - dimensional resonant photonic bandgap structures @xcite .",

    "superfluid state can emerge in different phases of the polaritons formed by dressing the doping atoms with the gapped light field .",
    "also the hybrid system of a two - dimensional array of coupled optical cavities in the photon - blockade regime will undergo a characteristic mott insulator ( excitations localized on each site ) to superfluid ( excitations delocalized across the lattice ) quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "such a coplanar hybrid structure based on superconducting circuit , has been proposed by us @xcite for the coherent control of microwave - photons propagating in a coupled superconducting transmission line resonator ( ctlr ) waveguide @xcite .        by making use of the two time green function approach",
    ", we studied the coherent control of photon transmission along the homogeneous crow by doping two - level atoms@xcite . usually , to realize the controllable and robust two - level system , a three - level atom is used to reduce an effective two level structure through the stimulated raman mechanism , which is two photon process decoupling the two direct transitions to upper energy level in the case with large detuning .",
    "then the induced coupling between two lower energy levels can be obtained by the adiabatic elimination of the upper energy level .    in this paper",
    ", we study the photon transmission in a homogeneous crow controlled coherently by doped three - level @xmath1-type systems , where the upper energy level is not eliminated adiabatically . to consider the coherent roles of three energy levels directly",
