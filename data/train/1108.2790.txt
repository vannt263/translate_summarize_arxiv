    "superstrong coronal lines have been detected in two galaxies spectroscopically observed in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) , sdss j095209.56 + 214313.3 ( hereafter sdss j0952 + 2143 , komossa et al . 2008 ) and sdss j124134.25 + 442639.2 ( gelbord et al .",
    "follow - up observations of sdss j0952 + 2143 showed that high ionization coronal lines were fading on time scales of years since their discovery ( komossa et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "two physical processes were proposed for the transient coronal lines : ( 1 ) an episodic accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) following the tidal disruption of a star in the vicinity of the central black hole ; and ( 2 ) a peculiar type supernova ( sn ) with strong coronal lines , such as sn2005ip discovered recently ( smith et al . 2009 ) . in the former case , it provides a way for a systematic search for the tidal disruption events through optical spectroscopic surveys , and thus , can be used to constrain the stellar distribution and dynamics in the vicinity of supermassive black holes , as well as the circum - nuclear environment .",
    "the latter case is also interesting in that , though coronal line emission in sns can be fairly well understood on the basis of current models , none of such models has been tested in these extreme cases .",
    "narrow coronal lines up to [ ] @xmath06087 , [ ] @xmath06376 , [ ] @xmath07894 , and [ ] @xmath05304  were observed in the late phase of a few sne ( e.g. , grningsson et al .",
    "2006 ; smith et al .",
    "sn2005ip is the only sn that coronal lines , together with recombination lines , were detected also in its early phase , probably a few weeks after the explosion .",
    "the coronal lines are thought to arise from the interaction between the sn and circum - stellar material ( csm ) .",
    "the x - rays from the radiative shock ionize csm , and give rise to emission lines of a wide range ionization states , including coronal lines .",
    "it is unclear whether superstrong coronal emitters ( sscles ) , in which coronal lines are a factor of several tens to hundreds more lumninous than sn2005ip , can still be understood within this context .",
    "strong variable narrow coronal lines has been detected in the galactic nucleus with soft x - ray flares ( komossa & bade 1999 ) .",
    "the x - ray flares are thought as a signature of stellar disruption by smbh ( e.g. , rees 1988 ; bade et al .",
    "1996 ; komossa et l. 2004 ; halpern , gezar & komossa 2004 ) .",
    "thus , it is natural to associate sscle with the tidal disruption process . as the tidal debris set down",
    ", it forms an accretion disk around the black hole .",
    "the strong uv and x - ray radiation from the accretion disk illuminates the outer debris as well as interstellar medium further out , giving rise to broad and narrow high ionization emission lines ( e.g. , komossa & bade 1999 ) .    to distinguish between the two scenarios",
    ", it is important to find spectroscopic signatures of both of a supernova and a tidal disruption flare .",
    "traditionally , core - collapse supernovae have been divided into different subtypes according to their spectral signature and/or the shape of light - curve ( see filippenko 1997 for a review ) .",
    "the different spectral signatures arise because different stellar evolution track of sn progenitor leads to different stellar radius , atmospheric chemical composition , and core mass .",
    "most massive stars will lose their entire hydrogen and even helium envelope in wolf - rayet star stage , resulting in a type ib or ic sn ; less massive stars will retain a hydrogen shell at the end of their evolution stage , ending with a type ii sn .",
    "type ii sn will be further divided into type ii - l and type ii - p , depending on the lack or presence of a plateaus in the light - curve , which may be connected to the thickness of hydrogen shell .",
    "stars with a mass just above 8 - 10 m@xmath5 will have a thick hydrogen shell at the end of red supergiant ( rsg ) , and explodes as a type ii - p sn with a plateaus in the light curve .    in this paper , we report the detection of variable broad bumps reminiscent of a young sn ii - p in the spectrum of the galaxy sdss j074820.67 + 471214.3 ( sdss j0748 + 4712  for short)a sscle at a redshift of z=0.0616 , which was identified during a systematic search of coronal line emitters in the sdss spectroscopic sample of galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the observations , data analysis , and results in  2 .",
    "the implications on the emission line region and ionizing continuum are discussed in  3 .",
    "we discuss several models of sscles in  4 . throughout this paper , we assume a @xmath6 dominated cosmology with @xmath7 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "sdss j0748 + 4712  was observed by sdss in the imaging mode at 2003 - 10 - 23 .",
    "a disk galaxy is seen in the position .",
    "an sdss spectrum centered on the nucleus was taken at 2004 - 02 - 20 , about 4 months after the imaging .",
    "the galaxy was detected in the galex survey on 2004 - 03 - 10 , 20 days after the spectroscopic observation , and reobserved by galex at 2010 - 01 - 09 in nuv .",
    "four low resolution ( @xmath10 ) optical spectra were taken with the omr cassegrain spectrograph mounted on the 2.16 m telescope at xinglong station of national astronomical observatory of china , one on 2008 - 12 - 25 , and three on 2009 - 03 - 25 with one hour exposure each .",
    "the spectra taken at the same night are combined .",
    "the slit is centered at the galactic nucleus with a width of 20 to match the seeing disk .",
    "the galaxy was detected in the 2mass survey at 1999 - 02 - 20 .",
    "the 2mass point source catalog quoted magnitudes of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , with a notation of association with an extended source .",
    "thus , these near - infrared magnitudes can only be considered as upper limits .",
    "all of the data were corrected for the galactic extinction of @xmath14 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) before further analysis .",
    "we examine the sdss spectrum , and find three broad bumps and numerous narrow high ionization coronal lines , including [ ] @xmath05304 , [ ] @xmath07894 , [ ] @xmath06376 , [ ] @xmath07612  and [ ] @xmath04414 , along with other lines commonly seen in an emission line galaxy , h@xmath15 , h@xmath16 , [ ] @xmath176548,6583 , [ ] @xmath176716,6732 , [ ] @xmath05007 , [ ] @xmath03727 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the broad bumps peak around 4050 , 4600 and 6560   with widths of several hundred  .",
    "these bumps do not correspond to any emission lines in an agn , but similar bumps are seen in the spectra of some supernovae . in the figure , we overlay also the spectra of type ii - p supernova sn1999gi on the day of discovery ( day 1 ; leonard et al .",
    "2002 ) , which is believed to correspond to only a few days after the shock breakout , and another type iip sn 2006bp , also a few days after the shock breakout ( quimby et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it is evident that the bumps look similar to sn1999gi and sn2006bp although their strengths are much larger .",
    "the broad bumps and coronal lines disappeared in the xinglong s spectra taken 4 and 5 years later , indicating these features are not persistent , while [ ] @xmath04959,5007 brightened remarkably ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the similarities of the broad bumps between sdss j0748 + 4712  and sns , including the centroids , profiles , and transient nature , motivate us to connect both of bumps and coronal lines to a sn - like flare .",
    "next , we check the spectral energy distribution ( sed , fig [ fig3 ] )",
    ". the synthesis magnitudes of the sdss spectrum in @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands are brighter than fiber magnitudes determined from the sdss imaging data by 0.51 , 0.44 and 0.47 mags , respectively .",
    "the median seeing during the spectral observation is about 20 , similar to that used to smooth the sdss image for fiber magnitude estimate ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) , thus fiber magnitudes properly reflect the galaxy light within the spectral fiber . however , sdss spectra are calibrated by tying synthesis magnitudes to the point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes for calibration stars , as a result , synthesis magnitudes are brighter than fiber magnitudes ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "the exact difference depends on the observational conditions and the surface brightness distribution of the source . in this paper",
    ", we estimate the distribution of the difference in each band using all galaxies on the same plate of sdss j0748 + 4712 .",
    "these distributions are then fitted with gaussian functions to evaluate mean deviations and their width .",
    "sdss j0748 + 4712  locates far away from the main distributions in all of the three bands .",
    "we calculate the variations in each band by subtraction the mean difference , and calculate the uncertainty by considering both the width of the distribution and the uncertainty in the synthesis magnitudes . assuming sdss",
    "photometric data are not affected by the supernova , we estimate the magnitudes of sn - like event to be 19.9@xmath210.24 , 20.5@xmath210.09 and 19.7@xmath210.13 at @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands . at the redshift of @xmath22 , the absolute magnitudes are @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 mag .",
    "the 2mass photometric fluxes are lower than sdss fluxes , indicating that they miss part of the extended light for the galaxy .",
    "the uv fluxes at 2004 - 03 - 10 are above the simple extrapolation of optical sed , suggesting substantial contribution from the sn - like activity .",
    "this is confirmed by that fact that the nuv magnitude at 2010 - 01 - 09 is about 0.68 mag fainter than that at 2004 - 03 - 10 .",
    "note that the nuv flux at 2010 - 01 - 09 is consistent with a nature extension of optical sed ( figure 2 ) .",
    "assuming that the later flux comes from the starlight , the absolute nuv magnitude of the flare was @xmath26 mag at 2004 - 03 - 10 without considering the intrinsic reddening .",
    "the sed of the host galaxy implies that the contribution of the host galaxy to the fuv flux at 2004 - 03 - 10 is much less than that in nuv , and fuv flux was dominated by the flare component .",
    "we fit the sdss spectrum with the starlight from the host galaxy and a supernova template first .",
    "the starlight is modeled as a combination of independent components ( ics ) , which are convolved with a gaussian kernel to match the absorption line width , and shifted in redshift to match the centroid of the absorption lines .",
    "the 6 ics were derived by applying ensemble learning ica to the simple stellar population of bc03 ( refer to lu et al .",
    "2006 for detail ) .",
    "a uniform extinction to the starlight is included as a free parameter .",
    "we adopt peter nugent s supernova templates for the sn component .",
    "the templates include 439 spectra of different type supernovae with several ages , including type ia , type ib , type ibc , type ii - l , type ii - p , and type ii - n , and peculiar type ia supernova , sn 1991bg and sn 1991 t . because of similarity of sdss j0748 + 4712  to the early spectra of sn 1999gi ( ii - p ) , sn 2006bp ( ii - p , immler et al . 2007 ;",
    "quimby et al .",
    "2007 ) and sn1991n ( type ic / b , filippenko & korth 1991 ) , we also include these spectra from suspect project ( see leonard et al .",
    "2002 ; quimby et al .",
    "2007 ; and matheson et al .",
    "2001 for original spectra ) .",
    "the optical spectra of the last three supernovae were corrected for the galactic and internal reddening from above literature .",
    "finally , we also added two spectra of sn 2005ip on day 1 , a few weeks after sn explosion , and on day 93 after the discovery ( smith et al .",
    "dust extinction to the supernova component is treated as a free parameter with the extinction curve of @xmath27 in cardelli et al .",
    "obvious narrow emission lines were masked during the fit .",
    "for each sn template , we obtain the best fitted parameters by minimizing @xmath28 .",
    "the least reduced @xmath28 is then sorted out among these minima , and the corresponding supernova template is considered as the best match . we find that sn 1999gi at day 1 provides the best fit ( reduced chi - square @xmath29 ) , followed by sn 2006bp at day 1 ( @xmath30 ) , also a few days after explosion .",
    "other templates gives significantly worse fit due to mismatch of the bumps .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , these fits are still not able to reproduce strong enough the 4600  bump strength .",
    "noticeably , there is a global deficit in the fit from the peak to the red side of the bump .",
    "the internal reddening of the supernova is relatively small with @xmath31 for sn199gi and sn2006bp templates .",
    "these templates give a consistent stellar velocity dispersions @xmath32 km  s@xmath2 . because the value is well below the spectral resolution of sdss and resolutions of ic templates and sdss spectrum",
    "are not perfectly matched , it can only be considered as an indication for a small stellar velocity dispersion . in passing ,",
    "we note that the late spectrum of sn2005ip do not provide fit to the sdss spectrum although the first day spectrum of sn2005ip gives a reasonable fit up to wavelength of 4900 . because the first day spectrum does not cover the wavelengths of two blue bumps , which are the most prominent features in the spectrum of sdss j0748 + 4712 , it is not clear if sdss j0748 + 4712  looks similar to sn2005ip at early stage .",
    "because sn templates do not provide good fits to the sdss spectrum , we also considered another empirical model consisting of a black body and four gaussian for bumps . with this description ,",
    "we obtain a much better fit to the sdss spectrum ( @xmath33 ; also figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the fit yields a temperature ( 1.3@xmath210.4 ) @xmath34 k and a moderate reddening @xmath35 , marginally larger than the sn template fit . in the following",
    ", we will refer this fit as our baseline model .",
    "we measure narrow emission lines in the residual spectrum after subtraction of the model continuum .",
    "each emission line is fitted with one gaussian except for h@xmath15 , which requires an additional broad component . in the fit to [ ]",
    "@xmath06583  and h@xmath15  blending , the width and center of the two narrow components are locked in the velocity space .",
    "continuum is modeled either as a local constant for isolated or close doublets , or as a linear function in [ ] + h@xmath16 , h@xmath15+[]+ [ ] regimes .",
    "this scheme yields accepted fits for all emission lines .",
    "the derived parameters are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "normal narrow lines , such as [ ] @xmath03727 , [ ] @xmath06583 , h@xmath15   have a width around @xmath36 km  s@xmath2 , after removal of the sdss instrumental broadening of 69 km  s@xmath2",
    ". their redshifts are consistent with being the same .",
    "[ ] @xmath05007  is very weak .",
    "@xmath37  is somewhat broader , perhaps due to including of an intermediate component , which is prominent in h@xmath15 .",
    "the line ratios , [ ] @xmath06583/h@xmath15  and [ ] @xmath05007/h@xmath16 , locates in the hii regime on the bpt diagram ( e.g. , kewley et al .",
    "therefore , these normal narrow lines are likely dominated by hii regions of the galaxy .",
    "the balmer decrement @xmath38 is consistent with the case - b recombination , indicating little dust extinction to the hii regions , in line with low extinction to starlight inferred in the last section .",
    "the [ ] @xmath06583/h@xmath15  and [ ] @xmath06716/h@xmath15  ratios suggest half a solar metallicity for the hii regions ( pettini & pagel 2004 ) .",
    "this is in line with the luminosity of galaxies ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the intermediate width component of h@xmath15  has a width of around 1500 km  s@xmath2and a flux of 2/3 of the narrow component .",
    "such a component may also be present in the h@xmath16 line ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , we did not include this component in the fit due to low signal to noise ratio .",
    "the coronal lines are much broader , but their profiles show subtle difference from one line to another ( fig [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "[ ] @xmath07894  is the narrowest ( @xmath40 km  s@xmath2 ) and redshifted by @xmath4170 km  s@xmath2with respect to h@xmath15  or [ nii ] .",
    "it is entirely possible that that [ ] @xmath06376  has a profile similar to that of [ ] @xmath07894 .",
    "the core component of [ ] @xmath06376  is very similar to that of [ ] @xmath07894 but there appears an additional weak blue component in [ ] @xmath06376 , which may be due to contamination of other lines .",
    "if this were verified , there would be a trend that higher ionization lines are blueshifted relative to lower ionization lines .",
    "other high ionization coronal lines are blueshifted by 40 to 130 km  s@xmath2  with respect to [ ] @xmath07894",
    ". these differences are larger than the uncertainty of the sdss spectral calibration .",

    "[ ] @xmath07612  is blueshifted ( @xmath4325 km  s@xmath2 ) , but with almost the same width ( 124@xmath2124 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "[ ] @xmath04414  appears also blueshifted and broader , though with a low s / n ratio . at a redshift of z=0.0616 ,",
    "the line luminosities are ( 8.8 , 7.4 , 7.5 , 3.6 and 3.5 ) @xmath44  erg  s@xmath2 , for [ ] @xmath06376 , [ ] @xmath07894 , [ ] @xmath05304 , [ ] @xmath07612  and [ ] @xmath04414  before correction for the internal reddening , which may affect the line luminosities by no more than 50% .",
    "we also measure the narrow emission lines in the bao spectra with a similar procedure but without a sn continuum component . despite the low s / n ratio of either spectrum , the coronal lines are very weak if present at all ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "however , [ ] @xmath05007 is 10 times stronger than in the sdss spectrum , suggesting the trend that low - ionization lines are being strengthened while high ionization being weakened ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "first we estimate the emission measure , @xmath45 , or @xmath46 for a uniform medium of volume @xmath47 , ion density @xmath48 and electron density @xmath49 , assuming that collisional de - excitation and continuum fluorescence are unimportant .",
    "the observed line luminosity relates to @xmath50 with , e.g. , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the collisional strength from the lower to the upper levels of the correspondent transition , which is a descending function of gas temperature @xmath53 , and n(fe@xmath54 ) the density of fe@xmath54 . if gas is photo - ionized , its temperature is around @xmath55 k ( e.g. , korista & ferland 1989 ) .",
    "we take the collisional excitation rates from the atomic data archive of chianti ( dere et al .",

    "note that collisional ionized gas will have a much higher temperature ( a few @xmath63  k ) , thus much lower @xmath52 , and requires one order of magnitude larger @xmath50 ( figure [ fig6 ] ) . assuming a solar abundance for @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 , and @xmath62 being the dominated species of the atom",
    ", we can derive a minimum @xmath66 [ ar / h]@xmath2 @xmath57 .",

    "are synthesized only during sne , it is unlikely that they are much more over - abundant in circum - stellar medium unless the coronal line region ( clr ) was polluted sn process , which seems less likely ( see below ) .",
    "next we explore what constraints on clr can be imposed based on the above estimates .",
    "a minimum size of clr can be set in the first place . for a uniform spherical clr",

    "[ ] has the lowest critical density of 1.5@xmath72 @xmath57 among these detected coronal lines , and gas density should not be much larger than this .",
    "this gives a minimum size of clr of order one light day . on the other hand , with this minimum radius , the gaseous column density of clr will be @xmath73 [ ar / h]@xmath74  @xmath75 . at this column density ,",
    "clr is optically thick to x - rays up to ten kev .",
    "however , photo - ionization requires that clr should be optically thin to soft x - ray rays because these photons ionize the gas . to meet this constraint",
    ", clr must be much larger than this minimum radius , i.e. , having much lower density .",
    "if the column density is less than a few @xmath76 @xmath75 , clr will be order of a light year and the density around @xmath63 @xmath57 .",
    "if gas in clr is in a thin shell or clumpy , clr can be smaller . in a thin shell case",
    ", the density and column density can be written as @xmath77 [ ar / h]@xmath78 @xmath57 , and @xmath79 [ ar / h]@xmath74  @xmath75 , where @xmath80 is the relative thickness . for a given density and @xmath50 , a smaller @xmath81 will result in a smaller column density and a larger radius .",
    "if @xmath82 , the gaseous column density will be order of a few 10@xmath83  @xmath75 , which is still not very optically thick to soft x - rays , and clr is order of 10 light days . the column density and density for clumpy gas should be in between the thin shell and uniform sphere case .",
    "these exercises suggest that clr should be larger than 10 light days in size .",
    "note in passing , if collisional de - excitation is important , the above estimated @xmath50 will be only a lower limit . on the other hand ,",
    "korista & ferland ( 1989 ) showed that far - uv ( @xmath41300 ) continuum pumping process accounts for nearly half of coronal emission line intensity in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the exact effect depends on the gas density and the shape of ionizing continuum . for the minimum size estimated above",
    ", the density is around @xmath69 @xmath57 . at this density",
    ", collision should dominate the excitation unless far - uv radiation field is very strong .",
    "thus we believe that it will not affect the order of magnitude estimate above .",
    "we assume that gas is photo - ionized because collisional ionization will require much larger emissivity .",
    "the ionization potential of fe@xmath84 , fe@xmath54 , fe@xmath85 , s@xmath86   and ar@xmath85  are 233.6 , 262.1 , 361 , 504 and 685.9 ev , so soft x - rays are required to ionize them . with the above estimated density ,",
    "the recombination time of the gas is @xmath87 , typically less than 1 hour for the ions listed above if @xmath88 @xmath57 , which should be shorter than the lasting time of x - ray radiation , while ionization time is even shorter than this if these ions are dominated species .",
    "therefore , the gas is likely in quasi - ionization equilibrium . in this case",
    ", we can estimate the ionizing photons absorbed by the corresponding ions from their coronal lines .",
    "each ion stays at the upper level on average for a time of @xmath89 before it recombines to a lower ionization sate , where @xmath90 is recombination coefficient to excited states . during that period ,",
    "the ion is collisionally excited @xmath91 times .",
    "if collisional de - excitation is not important , each collisional excitation will result in a coronal line photon .",
    "thus , the absorbed ionization photon flux can be written as , taking [ ] @xmath06376  as an example ,    @xmath92    one can write similar equations for [ ] @xmath07894 , [ ] @xmath05304 , [ ] @xmath04414  and [ ] @xmath07612 . by summing over all terms in the left and right , we estimate that a minimal x - ray luminosity absorbed by these ions is @xmath41 50 of the total coronal line luminosity .",
    "therefore , a minimum x - ray luminosity of a few @xmath4 erg  s@xmath2 is required to power the coronal lines in a photo - ionization equilibrium model .",
    "this estimate is in - exact because we have not considered two important processes .",
    "first , recombination to lower levels will emit a photon that may be able to ionize other ions .",
    "the re - emitted photons are distributed nearly isotropic with an average delay of recombination time with respective to incident ionizing radiation .",
    "second , the ionization of other ions requires additional x - rays .",
    "for example , when [ ] @xmath06376   to [ ] @xmath05304   become dominant species , hydrogen and helium - like oxygen , lithium - like neon , magnesium , and l - shell silicon are by up to a factor of ten more abundant than fe@xmath86 , fe@xmath93 , fe@xmath94 , s@xmath85  and ar@xmath94 for a gas with solar metallicity . giving the two effects",
    "are opposite , we believe that it still gives a reasonable order of magnitude estimate .",
    "note that the above estimated x - ray luminosity is much lower than the x - ray luminosity of seyfert galaxies with a similar coronal line luminosity ( @xmath95}/f_{x})=(-3.52\\pm 0.38)$ ] and @xmath96}/f_{x } ) = ( -3.43\\pm 0.55)$ ] ; gelbord et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "as discussed in  3.1 , it is quite possible that coronal line emission sustains for years although we only have an upper limit of 4 years to the decay time . in this case",
    ", the total energy in coronal lines would be about a few @xmath97  ergs . according to the above estimate",
    ", this requires a total energy in soft x - rays of @xmath98 ergs to power clr .",
    "in addition , a large amount of uv photons are required to ionize light elements , such as hydrogen , helium , etc .",
    "it should be noted that coronal lines can be ionized by an active x - ray source or they may be echoes of a past soft x - ray flare on extended medium .",
    "sdss j0748 + 4712  is the second sscle reported to show large line variations on time scale of years .",

    "but there are some obvious differences in their sdss discovery spectra .",
    "the sdss spectrum of sdss j0748 + 4712  displays prominent broad bumps and high ionization coronal lines but no [ ] and @xmath04686 , while the spectrum of the latter does not show such bumps but with prominent [ ] and .",
    "also intermediate width balmer lines are much weaker in sdss j0748 + 4712  than in sdss j0952 + 2143 .",
    "note that [ ] @xmath06376  luminosity in sdss j0748 + 4712  is a factor 5 times lower than in sdss j0952 + 2143 .",
    "we find four more sscles in the sdss spectroscopic sample of galaxies ( including the one in gelbord et al .",
    "2009 ) : two without [ ] emission while another two similar to sdss j0952 + 2143 .",
    "the similarity between sscles with and without [ ] @xmath06087  indicates that they are the same type object , while decreasing ionization with time in both objects suggests that different ionization of the line spectrum observed may be unified in a time evolution picture .",
    "sdss j0748 + 4712  was observed earliest among them , so it show highest ionization level , and also displays continuum and bump emission . as time passes , the broad bumps disappeared and intermediate width balmer lines increases , and the ionization of clr decreases .",
    "later on , both [ ] , [ ] and intermediate width balmer lines weaken , while [ ] and [ ] strengthen .",
    "further on , both coronal lines and the intermediate width component of balmer lines disappear , and [ ] and low ionization narrow lines further brighten .",
    "the time scale for such evolution is 3 - 5 years .",
    "future continuously monitoring of objects similar to sdss j0748 + 4712  can verify this picture .",
    "three pieces of evidence points to a sn - like activity in sdss j0748 + 4712 : 0.1 - 0.2 magnitude brightening between the sdss spectroscopic and photometric observations ; three broad bumps in the sdss spectrum similar to these seen in spectra of some young supernovae ; and vanishing of such features and coronal lines in the spectra taken 4 years later . by comparison of sdss photometric data with sdss spectrum",
    ", we estimated absolute magnitudes of the sn - like flare with @xmath9916.7 , @xmath9916.7 and @xmath9917.4 at @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands before correction for internal extinctions .",
    "the internal reddening correcting is quite modest ( @xmath100 mag in @xmath18 ) .",
    "this places its optical luminosity well in the range of a type ii - p supernova ( poznanski et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the broad bumps are similar to these in the spectra of type ii - p supernovae a few days after the shock - break . in type",
    "ii - p sn 2006bp , dessart et al ( 2008 ) identified the bump around 4000  as blended emission lines @xmath174001 - 4099 , that around 4600  as blending of @xmath04686 , @xmath04638 , @xmath04647 , and @xmath101 , and around 6500  due to mixture of hi and hei . with this interpretation ,",
    "the stronger 4600   bump and weak or absent he i 5760   bump , in comparison with sn 2005ip , indicates stronger emission , thus a higher photosphere temperature .",
    "notice that the 4600  bump evolves very fast in the first few days due to rapid decrease of the photosphere temperature ( dessart et al .",
    "2008 ) , and sn 1999gi , sn 2006bp are the only type ii - p known today to have been observed so early in the optical spectra showing he ii emission lines .",
    "it is unclear whether a spectrum taken at slightly earlier time than the above two sns will show 4600  bump as strong as observed in this object , and whether other type core - collapse supernovae at early phase can also reproduce similar spectral feature . an intermediate width h@xmath15 line is seen in the residual spectrum .",
    "such a line is usually considered as arising from interaction of the supernova with its circum - stellar medium ( csm ; filippenko 1997 ; pastorello et al .",
    "2002 ; smith et al .",
    "the presence of such material can be considered as an evidence for a massive sn progenitor , which tends to support a core - collapse sn .",
    "even though a young sn ii - p is a plausible explanation for the photometric variation and the broad bumps seen in the sdss spectrum , such a scenario has several drawbacks in explaining coronal line emission .",
    "first , the x - ray from young type ii - p sn is far insufficient to power the coronal lines .",
    "as noted in last section , a total amount of energy in the soft x - rays is likely greater than @xmath98 erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "if this energy is released in the shock breakout , which lasts for about @xmath102 s , then the x - ray luminosity would be @xmath103  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is several orders of magnitude higher than expected x - ray emission from type ii sn ( e.g. , soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ; nakar & sari , 2010 ) .",
    "alternatively , the ionizing x - rays are produced in the shock of blast wave into the dense csm .",
    "however , according to chevaliar and fransson ( 1994 ) , interaction of expanding shell with the csm can produce an x - ray luminosity of order @xmath104 erg  s@xmath2 , assuming half of x - rays are absorbed by the shell , where @xmath105 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath106 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath68 is the particle density at shock frontier in units of @xmath69  @xmath57 for a uniform spherical wind .",
    "this x - ray luminosity is an order of magnitude lower than that required to power the coronal lines if reasonable parameters are used .",
    "this energy budget is already noted by komossa et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "second , sn template fit suggests that sn is very young , a few days after the shock breakout .",
    "if coronal line emission is related to sne , clr at sdss observing time should be less than the light travel distance with the age of sn .",
    ", taking into account of such a delay will give a correction of order of unity .",
    "] however , a clr of at least 10 light days is required to account for high coronal line luminosity as discussed in  3.2 .",
    "finally , the width of coronal lines is not consistent with a rsg progenitor of type ii - p sn . giving the line width of 300 - 450 km  s@xmath2 in fwhm",
    ", it can not be formed in the shock region itself , which has a much larger velocity , or post - shock region because the expanding shell is opaque to these lines , rather it must be emitted from the pre - shocked region , as in the case of sn 2005ip ( smith et al . 2009 ) .",
    "also our analysis in  3.2 shows that clr is much larger than the expanding shell .",
    "thus , the kinematics of coronal line emitting gas reflects the undisturbed csm . in this case , the line is broadened due to different projected velocity of wind , and the wind velocity must be a few hundred km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this requires a compact progenitor , rather than a rsg , which produces a wind of order 15 km  s@xmath2 . in viewing of these problems",
    ", if supernova is responsible for the strong coronal line emission , it must be very different from any known sn .",
    "tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive / intermediate mass black hole ( smbh / imbh ) produces a flare , fading on time scales from several months to a year , in uv and x - rays with a peak luminosity close to eddington one once part of debris falls back to form an accretion disk around the black hole ( e.g. , rees 1988 ) .",
    "systematic search in the x - ray , uv and optical has lead the discovery of a dozen candidates ( komossa & bade 2004 ; halpern et al .",
    "2004 ; esquej et al .",
    "2008 ; rosswag , ramirez - ruiz & hix 2009 ; maksym , ulmer & eracleous 2010 ; sari et al .",
    "komossa et al ( 2008 ) proposed tidal disruption may be also responsible for variable coronal line emission .",
    "both sdss and our spectrum includes the galactic center , this process should be considered as well . as",
    "komossa et al .",
    "( 2009 ) pointed out that tidal disruption can potentially accounts for the observed emission line and continuum properties of sdss j0952 + 2143  although detail model prediction is still lack .",
    "the uv and x - ray radiation from the accretion disk is a natural ionizing source .",
    "when the flare illuminates surrounding gas , it ionizes and excites gas , giving rise to broad and narrow emission lines , depending on the gas kinematics . the variable intermediate - width",
    "double horn balmer lines in that object were interpreted as from unbounded tidal debris illuminated by the central radiation , while coronal lines are formed by the dense circum - nuclear gas .",
    "much of their arguments are valid for sdss j0748 + 4712  as well .",
    "as far as the central back hole is greater than @xmath107 , the accretion disk can account for high soft x - ray ionizing photons .",
    "black hole of @xmath108 in the galactic center is entirely possible giving the luminosity of the galaxy ( @xmath109 ) , although much larger than this can be ruled out from stellar velocity dispersion measurement ( tremaine et al .",
    "if clr is virialized and dominated by the gravity of the black hole , gas at @xmath110 will produce a line width similar around 300@xmath99400 km  s@xmath2 ( fwhm ) , similar to the observed coronal line width . for a black hole with a mass @xmath111",
    ", this corresponds to a size of a few ten light days , which meet the constraints in  3.2 .",
    "photometric variations and broad bumps in the spectrum can put additional constraints on the tidal disruption model .",
    "the accretion rate , so luminosity , is determined by the fall - back rate of bounded tidal debris , which decreases with time as @xmath112 after reaching its peak ( rees 1988 ; c.f .",
    "lodato , king & pringle 2009 ) .",
    "the target was brighter during the sdss spectroscopic observation than during the photometric observation .",
    "this set an upper limit to the age of disruption event to 4 months during sdss spectroscopic observation in sdss j0748 + 4712 .",
    "the flare has an absolute optical magnitude @xmath113 during the spectroscopic observation , which is on the same order of magnitude as predicted by some models for a @xmath114 black hole ( e.g. , strubbe & quatuert 2009 ) .",
    "the broad bumps probably can be interpreted as optical emission lines .",
    "strubbe & quataert ( 2009 ) argued that most tidal debris should blow away in a wind at the early times , leaving very broad optical emission lines in the spectrum for @xmath108 black holes . in their model ,",
    "the strongest lines are balmer ones , which can not explain strong bumps in the sdss spectrum of sdss j0748 + 4712 .",
    "however , if a star is strongly evolved , and much of hydrogen envelope has been stripped off . then tidal debris should be helium - enriched , this may explain strong blue - shifted heii line .",
    "it should be noted that the bumps around 4600   can be fairly well fitted with a combination of heii , h@xmath16 and 6560   with h@xmath15 , with their line centers and widths locked",
    ". detailed physical model , which is beyond the scope of this paper , is certainly needed to verify this explanation .",
    "we detected broad bumps , reminiscent of a young type ii - p supernova , and strong high ionization coronal lines in the spectrum of sdss j0748 + 4712 .",
    "the coronal line luminosity is typical of seyfert galaxies , but other narrow lines suggest a normal star - forming galaxy .",
    "the source brightened by about 0.2 magnitudes in @xmath18-band from the sdss imaging to sdss spectroscopic observations in 4 months . these bumps and coronal lines disappeared in the spectra taken 4 - 5 years later , while [ ] line increases by a factor of ten .",
    "the variation trend is similar to another sscle reported previously , suggesting of the same physical origin .",
    "their different properties between the two objects may be ascribed to different observed evolution stage .",
    "we set a robust lower limit on the size of clr to be 10 light days , and on the total energy of the ionizing continuum in soft x - rays to be @xmath98  erg .",
    "both the size of emission line region , high soft x - ray luminosity and broad width of coronal lines can not be understood in the young type ii - p supernova context .",
    "if coronal lines are indeed associated with supernova explosion , then the supernova must be very different from that current known .",
    "we argued that tidal disruption of evolved star by a massive black hole may provide a viable explanation from the bumps and coronal lines . in this model , the bumps are considered as broad emission lines from winds produced during the tidal disrupted process ( strubbe & quataert 2009 ) , and the star is partially evolved .    a critical test to",
    "the above scenario should come from continuous monitoring the spectral evolution and early follow - up in other bands , such as x - ray , uv and infrared band , shortly after the discovery of the coronal line emitter .",
    "x - ray and uv emission from supernova predicted in current model drops very fast after hours and ten days ( nakar & sari , 2010 ) , while in the tidal disruption model , the tidal debris is accreted on the time scale of years ( e.g. , lodato , king & pringle 2009 ) .",
    "we found that the absolute magnitude of the flare in galex nuv band is -17.3 at 20 days after the sdss spectroscopic observation for sdss j0748 + 4712 , which is brighter than that predicted by supernova models , but consistent with the tidal disruption model .",
