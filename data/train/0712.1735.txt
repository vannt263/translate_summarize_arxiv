    "during the last few decades several complex surface reconstructions that exhibit one - dimensional metal wires have been extensively studied .",
    "the interest in these systems has been mainly driven by the theoretical prediction that the behavior of a one - dimensional metal should sensibly deviate from the fermi liquid picture due to electron correlation .",
    "@xcite however , the coupling between electrons and lattice vibrations is also enhanced in one dimension and these systems present a strong tendency to suffer structural transitions that reduce their symmetry and destroy their metallicity .",
    "the competition between the effects of electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions makes the physics of one - dimensional systems quite a rich and interesting topic . in this context , the quasi - one - dimensional reconstructions formed by several metals on flat and vicinal si(111 ) surfaces have been regarded as ideal systems to realize a one - dimensional metal .",
    "on the one hand , the existence of an electronic gap in the substrate allows for the existence of purely one - dimensional electronic states near the fermi energy associated with the metal chains in the surface . on the other hand",
    ", it was believed that in some cases the rigidity of the substrate could allow for the observation of characteristic features of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid in the photoemission experiments ,  @xcite avoiding the appearance of broken - symmetry phases at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "furthermore , ordered arrays of well aligned wires can be formed over large areas on these susbtrates , which allow for accurate measurements using angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) . in the case of vicinal substrates",
    "the average terrace width can be controlled by the miscut angle , providing a route to tune inter - wire distances and interactions .",
    "@xcite    some examples of quasi - one - dimensional reconstructions that have attracted much attention in recent years are the si(111)-(5@xmath12)-au ,  @xcite si(557)-au ,  @xcite si(553)-au ,  @xcite and si(111)-(4@xmath12)-in  @xcite surfaces .",
    "all these systems show clear one - dimensional features both in arpes and scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) experiments . at least in the cases of the si(557)-au , si(553)-au and si(111)-(4@xmath12)-in surfaces some of these one - dimensional bands seem to be metallic at room temperature .",
    "however , these three reconstructions suffer structural distortions associated with metal - insulator transitions when the temperature is lowered .",
    "@xcite    the photoemission spectrum of the si(557)-au surface is dominated by two proximal one - dimensional bands with a parabolic - like dispersion . according to the _ ab initio _ calculations based on the existing structural model  @xcite",
    "these two bands are due to the spin - orbit splitting of a band coming from the hybridization of the states of the gold chains with their silicon neighbors .  @xcite these bands are half - filled and exhibit , as the temperature is lowered , a metal - insulator transition that is accompanied by a periodicity doubling along the steps in the stm images .",
    "@xcite    the si(553)-au surface , with a smaller terrace width , shows two bands similar to those observed in the case of the si(557)-au system .",
    "it also shows a strongly - dispersing one - dimensional band with a fractional ( @xmath2 ) filling .  @xcite it was proposed that this one - third - filled band could provide the appropriate conditions to observe large spin - charge separation",
    "this is in contrast with half - filled bands , which are unstable against a mott - hubbard transition for large values of the electron - electron interaction , preventing the observation of a luttinger metal  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the si(553)-au surface also undergoes a metal - insulator transition at low temperatures .",
    "the si(553)-au surface exhibits two peierls - like distortions with a @xmath12 and @xmath13 increase of the unit cell of the chains along the steps .",
    "this is consistent with the occupations of the bands mentioned above .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath13 periodicity seems to be associated with the step - edge , while the @xmath12 periodicity appears in the middle of the terraces .",
    "this is consistent with the origin of the half - filled bands in the gold wires . _",
    "ab initio _ calculations indicate that the gold atoms prefer to occupy in silicon substitutional positions in the middle of the terraces .",
    "@xcite    a good structural model is necessary to understand in detail the physics of this system .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of the si(557)-au surface , the structure of the si(553)-au reconstruction is not well established .",
    "recently ghose _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a structure based on the analysis of x - ray diffraction measurements .",
    "this model contains a double row of au atoms decorating the step edge .",
    "this seems inconsistent with the experimental gold coverage and the model has proven to be unstable .",
    "@xcite in a recent work  @xcite we studied , using first - principles density - functional calculations , five different structural models based on an analogy with the structure of the si(557)-au surface and an earlier proposal by crain _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite with a single gold chain .",
    "the most stable structures were those in which the step edge is formed by honeycomb - chain .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper we perform a more comprehensive search of the structure of the si(553)-au reconstruction .",
    "we have considered models in which the topmost bilayer contains eight atoms per 5@xmath11 unit cell , including one gold atom , with all different coordinations and registries with the underlying bulk .",
    "we refer to these models as `` flat '' surface - bilayer structures and we have found that there are 210 inequivalent structures of this type when reasonable physical constraints are applied .",
    "these structures are generated automatically and an iterative procedure , with a step - by - step increase of the accuracy and computational cost of the calculations , is used to study this large number of configurations .",
    "we have also considered nine different structures obtained by the substitution of a silicon atom by a gold atom in different positions of a @xmath0-bonded chain reconstruction of the si(553 ) surface .",
    "as we will see , our most stable structures belong to the set of flat - bilayer models and exhibit a honeycomb - chain structure in the step edge .",
    "this in agreement with the observation of our previous study .",
    "indeed the two most stable structures ( f2 and f4 models ) correspond to structures that have already been explored in ref .  .",
    "this confirms that the analogy with the si(557)-au surface provides a good route to study the structure of the si(553)-au reconstruction and , most probably , other related surfaces .",
    "@xcite the simulated stm images of the f2 and f4 models are in good agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "@xcite their band structures also reproduce the main features of the photoemission data .",
    "@xcite in particular , the band structure of the f2 model shows two dispersive one - dimensional bands and one of them , associated with a silicon dangling - bond in the surface , has a small fractional occupation in agreement with the measurements .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the f2 model is a good candidate for the structure of the si(553)-au .    finally , we have developed a compact notation that allows us to label and identify all the structures .",
    "this notation is instrumental for the automatic generation of trial geometries and for counting the number of inequivalent ( having different bonding topologies ) structures .",
    "this notation is applicable to other similar surfaces and we think that it will be useful for other structural investigations .",
    "most of the calculations were performed using the siesta code  @xcite we used the local density approximation  @xcite and norm conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite .",
    "the gold pseudopotential included scalar relativistic effects and was similar to that used in ref .   and in our previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "different basis sets were used for the silicon atoms ( see below for more details ) . for the fastest calculation a single-@xmath3 basis ( sz ) of numerical atomic orbitals  @xcite was used .",
    "the sz basis uses only one radial function to represent the orbitals in the 3@xmath4 shell and another one for the 3@xmath5 shell . for more accurate calculations double-@xmath3 basis ( dz ) , with two different radial functions for each angular momentum , and double-@xmath3 polarized ( dzp ) , including",
    "an additional polarization 3@xmath6 shell , were used . for gold , a dzp basis",
    "was always used with two different radial functions to represent the 6@xmath4 and 5@xmath6 orbitals and a polarization 6@xmath5 shell .",
    "the radius of the si orbitals was 5.25 bohr for those in the 3@xmath4 shell and 6.43 bohr for those in the 3@xmath5 and 3@xmath6 shells .",
    "for au the radius of the 6@xmath4 and 6@xmath5 orbitals was 6.24 bohr and 4.51 bohr for the orbitals in the 5@xmath6 shell .",
    "we modelled the surface using slabs with different thicknesses ( depending on the desired accuracy ) . for the initial and fastest simulations we used a slab containing only two silicon bilayers , whereas four bilayers were used to more accurately explore the energetics of the most favorable structural models .",
    "the atoms in the bottom silicon layer were kept at their ideal bulk positions and saturated with hydrogen atoms . a vacuum gap of 15    between neighboring slabs was used . to avoid",
    "artificial stresses the lateral lattice parameter was always fixed to the bulk theoretical value calculated with the similar approximations .",
    "the lattice parameter depends strongly on the basis set used .",
    "the calculated values are 5.53 , 5.48 , and 5.42     for sz , dz and dzp basis sets , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to rescale the coordinates when the result of a relaxation using a given basis set is used as the initial guess for a calculation with a more complete basis .",
    "systems were relaxed until the maximum force component along any direction was less than 0.04 ev /  .",
    "different monkhorst - pack  @xcite samplings of the surface brillouin zone were utilized .",
    "they will be referred along this paper as m@xmath1n , where m refers the direction parallel and n perpendicular to the step edge . a real - space grid equivalent to a 100  ry plane - wave cut - off was used .",
    "the simulated stm images were obtained using the tersoff - haman theory  @xcite and the dzp basis set .",
    "for the most stable systems we also performed calculations using the vasp code @xcite .",
    "projected - augmented - wave potentials and a well converged plane - wave basis set with a cutoff of 312  ev were used .",
    "all structures were relaxed ( the equilibrium lattice parameter of bulk silicon obtained with vasp was 5.41   ) .",
    "searching for the lowest - energy configuration of any surface reconstruction is a formidable task .",
    "almost any trial geometry that is not completely absurd relaxes to a nearby local minimum .",
    "one can then generate manually new configurations from the most favorable ones using different physical ( electron - counting , coordination , etc . )",
    "arguments , hoping to eventually end up in the global minimum .",
    "however , the number of local minima scales roughly exponentially with the number of atoms involved in the reconstruction and the problem becomes intractable for large cells .",
    "apart from this heuristic approach one can use more sophisticated algorithms that can automatically find optimum geometries .",
    "some examples are simulated annealing  @xcite and monte carlo simulations of different types , including genetic algorithms  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo techniques have been traditionally used to find cluster geometries  @xcite , and have been recently extended to find surface reconstructions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately these methods are computationally very expensive requiring long simulations with thousands of evaluations of the system energy ( and interatomic forces in some cases ) .",
    "particularly , genetic algorithms are very powerful but typically need hundrends of generations , each one containing tens of trial geometries  @xcite .",
    "therefore , they are mostly restricted to the use of empirical interatomic potentials which , however , might not be sufficiently accurate to reproduce the energetics of the different geometries explored .    in the present work we adopt a compromise between these two ideas .",
    "due to the lack of reliable empirical potentials to represent the interaction between the gold and silicon atoms in the surface , we need to explore the energetics of the different models of the si(553)-au reconstruction at the density functional or similar level of theory .",
    "this precludes the use of monte carlo algorithms to perform a global search of the reconstruction structure .",
    "however , we do not want to restrict our search to explore a  few \" structural models .",
    "thus , we will rather make a _ systematic _ search of the optimum surface model within a large family of physically motivated structures .",
    "our approach is the following :    _ i _ ) a family of likely structural models for the si(553)-au surface reconstruction is defined using a heuristic procedure based on the analogy with other related and better known surfaces ;    _ ii _ ) a compact notation is designed to label unambigously each of the possible structures within this family ;    _ iii _ ) from each of these labels , a trial geometry is generated automatically and an initial constrained relaxation is performed to avoid the appearance of unphysical bond distances ;    _ iv _ )  fast \" density functional calculations using siesta are used to relax each of the structures to its closest local energy minimum ;    _ v _ ) the most stable configurations from step _ iv _ ) are studied using more time consuming  accurate \" siesta calculations ;    _ vi _ ) finally , since the energy differences between different structural models are quite small , we check the energy ordering of our most stable configurations using a different methodology : plane - wave calculations using the vasp code .    by  fast \" siesta calculations we mean here calculations performed using small basis sets ( i.e , with a small number of basis orbitals per atom , like sz or dz basis sets @xcite ) , limiting the number of k - points and optimized degrees of freedom and/or using less stringent criteria than usual for the convergence of the self - consistency cycles .",
    "these approximations substatially reduce the computational cost .",
    "therefore , it becomes possible to relax the hundreds of different configurations within our family of structures .",
    "we will see below that the energies obtained in this first step are reliable enough to select a set of a few tens of structures containing the most promising structural candidates .  accurate \"",
    "siesta calculations are performed for these configurations using dzp basis sets , a larger k - sampling and well converged self - consistency .",
    "we can see that the use of a code that utilizes basis sets of atomic orbitals is instrumental for this gradual increment of the accuracy of the calculations : while the pseudopotentials , density functional , and basic numerical scheme remains unchanged , the size of the basis set ( the main factor limiting the size of the studied systems and the computational time ) can be varied .",
    "this provides a very convenient way to deal with the trade - off between computational speed and accuracy of the calculation . for the si(111)-(5@xmath12)-au we have recently shown that siesta calculations using dzp basis sets are in excellent agreement with well converged plane - wave calculations .",
    "@xcite in the present work we confirm this observation for the proposed models for the si(553)-au surface .",
    "this seems to confirm that our final structures are the most favorable within the family considered here .    in the following we present in detail",
    "the hierarchy of approximations used to perform our simulations . as a starting point",
    "we automatically generate approximate coordinates for all possible structures fulfilling certain conditions .",
    "these conditions will be explained in detail in the next section .",
    "our family of structural models is based on plausible analogies with the structure of other related surface reconstructions like the si(557)-au or si(111)-(5@xmath12)-au .",
    "while reasonable atomic coordinates within the plane of the terrace ( that we take as the @xmath7-plane ) are relatively easy to guess due to the registry with the sub - surface bilayer , the height of the different atoms in the surface bilayer is more problematic . for this reason , in the first relaxation ( named @xmath8 hereafter ) only the atoms in the topmost bilayer are allowed to relax in the @xmath9-direction ( normal to the terrace ) .",
    "this relaxation step ensures the interatomic distances to be reasonable without changing the topology of the surface bilayer and its registry with the underlying atoms .",
    "for the @xmath8 relaxations we use a sz basis set and a 2@xmath11 k - sampling . to further accelarate the simulations the parameter determining the convergence of the density matrix in each relaxation step ( dm.tolerance  @xcite ) is set to 10@xmath10 .",
    "the typical value given to this parameter to ensure a very good convergence of the self - consistent solution is 10@xmath11 .",
    "however , we have checked that increasing this value to 10@xmath10 only introduces small errors in the calculation of energy and forces : for example , the maximum force difference during the relaxation of a few representative structures of those studied here was less than 0.01  ev /    when the two different convergence criteria were used . in spite of this moderate effect on the results , in some cases increasing the value of dm.tolerance to 10@xmath10 reduces considerably the number of iterations per self - consistency cycle . in the next step ( named @xmath12 hereafter )",
    "all atoms are allowed to move ( except the silicion atoms in the bottom of the slab and the hydrogen atoms directly bonded to them ) . however , in order to preserve the topology of the selected configuration , the positions of the atoms along the direction parallel to the step edges ( @xmath13-axis ) is fixed .",
    "other parameters have the same value as in the relaxation @xmath8 .",
    "the purpose of the relaxations @xmath8 and @xmath12 is to provide a sound initial configuration from the coordinates generated automatically . using this corrected guess",
    "we can proceed further allowing all degrees of freedom in the slab to relax and using a more complete dz basis set and accurate 8@xmath14 k - sampling .",
    "we call this the @xmath14 relaxation . finally , in the @xmath15 relaxations we further decrease the tolerance for the covergence of the elements of the density matrix to its usual default value in siesta  @xcite of 10@xmath11 .",
    "we use a dzp basis set for our most accurate relaxations ( @xmath16 hereafter ) . adding",
    "a polarization shell with @xmath6 symmetry can be especially important to accurately describe  unusual \" coordinations of the silicon atoms which can not be described with simple @xmath17 hybridizations .",
    "the use of this series of optimization schemes with ever - increasing accuracy ( @xmath8@xmath18@xmath12@xmath18@xmath19@xmath18@xmath15@xmath18@xmath16 ) is much more efficient than starting directly with a relaxation at the @xmath16 or similar level .",
    "the reason for this efficiency gain is twofold : _ i _ ) the initial coordinates used to start each relaxation have been optimized at the previous level and , therefore , they are an initial guess of increasing quality ; _ ii _ ) the energy estimates obtained with the less accurate relaxations , already at the @xmath12 level , are accurate enough to allow discarding many of the possible configurations in favor of the most favorable models .",
    "this is the case even if at the @xmath12 level we use a minimal basis set , a thin slab of two bilayers and we fix the atomic coordinate parallel to the step edge in order to preserve the selected bonding topology .",
    "one has to take into account that a minimal basis for si contains only four orbitals , a dz basis eight orbitals , and a dzp basis thirteen orbitals .",
    "thus the computational cost changes dramatically when changing the basis set size .",
    "additional gains are obtained by using smaller k - samplings and reducing the number of step in each self - consistent cycle .",
    "the structural models that we considered here for the si(553)-au reconstruction are based on the analogy with other similar reconstructions  @xcite for which there is more structural information . in particular , the vicinal si(557)-au surface reconstruction has been extensively studied in recent years , and its structure has been established from x - ray studies  @xcite and dft calculations .",
    "@xcite like in the case of the si(553)-au surface , the steps of the si(557)-au run along the @xmath20 $ ] and each terrace contains a monatomic chain of gold atoms .",
    "the main difference is the orientation of the miscut angle , which is the opposite in both cases .",
    "@xcite the size of the terraces is also different , it is larger in the case of si(557)-au allowing for the presence of a row of silicon adatoms running parallel to the step edge  @xcite which seems to be absent in the case of the si(553)-au surface .",
    "therefore , it is clear that both structures can be quite different ( particularly the step - edge configuration ) , and one has to be careful when trying to translate structural information from one system to the other .",
    "fortunately we also have a considerably amount of information about the reconstruction induced by submonolayer deposition of gold in flat si(111 ) .",
    "the structure of the si(111)-(5@xmath12)-au surface , corresponding to a larger gold coverage than those commented above , was established experimentally by marks and plass  @xcite using high resolution electron microscopy and heavy - atom holography .",
    "recent first - principles calculations have shown that the real structure is probably somewhat different from this original proposal  @xcite and might even depend on the concentration of silicon adatoms present in the surface .",
    "@xcite however , there are several common elements to most of the proposed models , which are also shared by the si(557)-au reconstruction",
    ". the most important features of the most stable structural models of these surfaces are :    _ i _ ) the reconstruction only involves the atoms in the topmost bilayer ;    _ ii _ ) the gold atoms occupy substitutional positions in the surface layer , which are much more favorable than adatom - like sites ;    _ iii _ ) positions of gold in the middle of terraces are favored over step - edge decoration ;    _ iv _ ) frequent appearance of the so - called honeycomb chain ( hc )  @xcite structure .",
    "fig  [ fig : fig1 ]  ( a ) shows a schematic view of an unreconstructed si(553 ) surface . taking into account the points _ i _ ) and _ ii _ ) we only explore here reconstructions generated adding an additional bilayer ontop of this unreconstructed substrate .",
    "one of the silicon positions is replaced by a gold atom .",
    "different registries with underlying bilayer are allowed , as well as , the presence of hc structures .",
    "fig  [ fig : fig1 ]  ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) show a few possible structures .",
    "structure ( b ) recovers the unreconstructed surface .",
    "structure ( c ) presents stacking fault in the middle of the terrace with the accompanying surface dislocations with under- and over - coordinated atoms ( indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . in panel",
    "( c ) the surface bilayer contains a hc structure in the middle of the terrace .",
    "notice that the hc reconstruction also creates a stacking fault towards the @xmath21 $ ] direction ( i.e. , towards the inner part of the terrace ) .",
    "this stacking fault has to be corrected in order to connect with the bulk structure .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to introduce a surface dislocation with over - coordinated atoms ( marked with an arrow ) .",
    "the importance of the hc structure for the gold induced reconstructions on vicinal si(111 ) has been recently emphasized by crain _",
    "et al . _",
    "it is known to form the step - edge of the si(557)-au surface  @xcite .",
    "it is also a key ingredient of the most recent proposals for the structure of the si(111)-(5@xmath12)-au reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "the hc structure was initially proposed to explain the low coverage reconstructions induced by some alkali metals ( li , na , k ) , mg and ag on si(111 )  @xcite .",
    "we see that the hc structure involves two unit cells of the unreconstructed si(111 ) surface , with one atom removed from the top si layer .",
    "this flattens the surface and removes surface stress .",
    "the two silicon atoms in the center of the hc structure have a double bond , which is further stabilized by its hybridization with the dangling - bond of atom immediately below . in the case of reconstructions induced by alkalis",
    ", the metal atoms donate electrons to the hc becoming a closed - shell structure and thus contributing to the stabilization of the surface .",
    "@xcite in the case of gold , which has a stronger electron affinity , the situation is different .",
    "gold is likely to take electrons away from the silicon structure . in principle",
    ", this does not prevent an electronic stabilization mechanism : one electron may be transferred to the 6@xmath4 au state , leading again to a closed - shell structure",
    ". however , we are typically far from this _ ionic _ situation .",
    "the states of gold are strongly hybridized with those of the neighboring silicon atoms creating several dispersive bands that are , in principle , metallic  @xcite and dominate the photoemission spectra .    in ref .",
    "we explored a few structural models for the si(553)-au reconstruction based on an analogy with the si(557)-au surface . here",
    "we want to move a step further and to make a comprehensive search among the structural models that can be built following the rules ( _ i_)-(_iv _ ) presented above .",
    "we consider _ all _ possible structures where the atoms of the topmost bilayer present coordinations between 2 and 4 with other atoms in the same bilayer .",
    "the final coordination depends on the registry with the underlying silicon structure .",
    "one of the silicon atoms in the unit cell is replaced by a gold atom .",
    "the si(553)-au reconstruction is known to suffer several distortions that increase the size of the unit cell along the step direction as the temperature is decreased .",
    "@xcite however , here we only consider models that preserve the @xmath11 periodicity of the silicon substrate along the steps and , therefore , are relevant to model the high temperature structure .",
    "we have developed a simple labelling scheme for the family of structural models that fulfill the criteria presented above .",
    "we can label each structure and thus count the total number of different trial structures within this family .",
    "furthermore , this scheme can be easily translated into a procedure to automatically generate the trial geometries .",
    "the basis of our labelling procedure can be found in fig .",

    "first , the possible positions within the _ xy _ plane of the surface atoms are discritized and approximated by the points of a grid .",
    "the grid is formed by nine columns and two rows .",
    "the nine columns correspond to the positions of the atoms along the @xmath22 $ ] direction in the terrace of an unreconstructed si(553 ) surface ( see the fig .  [",

    "second , all possible structures created by distributing the atoms among the grid points can be translated into a sequence of nine numbers .",
    "the position along the horizontal coordinate ( column ) is indicated by the order in the numerical sequence .",
    "the first number corresponds to the atoms at the step edge . for a given column , a `` 2 '' (  4 \" ) indicates that a silicon ( gold ) atom is located in the higher row , i.e. , in the middle of the rectangular terrace unit cell , whereas a1 \" (  3 \" ) indicates that a silicon ( gold ) atom sits over a grid point in the lower row .",
    "a  0 \" indicates that there are no atoms in that column . using this scheme , the unreconstructed si(553 ) surface in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]  ( b ) can be label as ( 1,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,1 ) , while structures in panels ( c ) and ( d ) would receive the label ( 1,2,2,2,1,1,2,1,1 ) and ( 1,2,2,1,0,1,2,1,1 ) , respectively .",
    "other examples , corresponding to models already studied in ref .",
    ", can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .    in principle , using our notation we can generate m different models , with @xmath23 and n@xmath24 being the number of silicon atoms in the surface bilayer . since we always have one gold atom , the total number of atoms in the terrace unit cell is n@xmath25=n@xmath24 + 1 .",
    "we consider here structures with n@xmath24=7 . in this way",
    ", the family of structures studied here includes the five models already discussed in ref .  .",
    "furthermore , having n@xmath25=8 is a necessary condition to allow for the formation of the hc structure , which is one of the common building blocks to several gold induced reconstructions in si(111 ) and vicinal si(111 ) surfaces ( see above ) .",
    "with n@xmath24=7 we have m=18432 different models .",
    "this large number can be considerably reduced imposing a few constraints to ensure that the models represent physically sound structures .",
    "these constraints are : _ a _ ) in order to connect with the bulk structure the last number of the series must be either 1 or 3 ; _ b _ ) the dangling - bonds of the underlying silicon bilayer must be saturated either by an atom or by a dimer as in the hc structure , therefore the first number of the labelling sequence must be always 1 or 3 , _",
    "c _ ) the fifth number must be 0 , 1 or 3 ( if 0 , then the neighboring numbers must be either 1 or 3 ) , and _",
    "d _ ) the third and seventh number must be 0 , 2 or 4 ( if 0 , then the neighboring numbers in the sequence must be 2 or 4 ) ; _ e _ ) to ensure the connectivity within the surface bilayer , a non - zero number in the sequence can not be surrounded by zeros and _ f _ ) two or more zeros can not appear together .",
    "taken into account conditions ( _ a_)-(_f _ ) , the number of possible configurations with n@xmath25=8 and n@xmath24=7 is reduced to m=210 . in this work",
    "we will explore these 210 configurations using `` fast ''",
    "siesta calculations , as decribed in the previous section , and a few tens of the most stable configurations will be selected to perform more accurate siesta and vasp calculations .",
    "our notation provides information about the connectivity within the surface bilayer and the registry with the substrate . from a given sequence of nine numbers we can generate a trial geometry .",
    "however , we lack information about the heights of the different atoms . due to this and to the discretization of positions in the _",
    "xy_-plane , the bond lenghts and angles in the automatically generated structures can considerably depart from the correct values .",
    "for this reason , as a first step to get sound initial configurations we need to perform constraint relaxations that , while preserving the bonding topology of the selected configuration avoid unphysical bond distances and angles .",

    "we have explored a few structural models based on the @xmath0-bonded chain reconstruction of the si(111 ) surface .",
    "@xcite in principle , our notation can not describe these bonding pattern : it can only describe structures which are based on a `` flat '' surface bilayer .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "these double occupation indicates the position of the @xmath0-bonded chain in the structure .",
    "we still have the ambiguity about the relative height of atoms in the @xmath0-bonded chain , which is known to be tilted .",
    "there are two possibilities which are usually referred as negative or positive tilt .",
    "@xcite in our notation these two different tilts of the @xmath0-chain are indicated by the order of the pair of indices , the second index corresponding to the higher atom . in fig .",

    "this negative tilt @xmath0-chain block corresponds to the label ( ... , 1,0,2,21,1 , ... ) , while the label ( ... , 1,0,2,12,1 , ... ) denotes the positive tilt structure .",

    "@xcite experimentally the positive tilt structure has been traditionally favored .",
    "@xcite in the case of the si(553 ) stepped surface , our calculations predict the negative tilt structure to be slightly more stable .",
    "this notation opens the possibility of generating and studying all possible structures containing the @xmath0-bonded chain .",
    "however , we have not pursued this approach here and we limit to consider nine different structural models that are obtained after the substitution of one silicon atom by a gold atom in different positions of a @xmath0-bonded chain reconstruction similar to that shown in fig  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we take advantage of the methodology described in sections [ sec : relaxations ] and [ sec : labelling ] to make an extensive search of the structure of the si(553)-au reconstructions .",
    "we make a systematic search within the 210 structures that can be generated with the notation presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : labelling ] ( models based on `` flat '' bilayers with different coordinations and registries with the susbtrate ) with seven silicon atoms and one gold atom in the terrace unit cell .",

    "several of the initial structures converge to the same configuration , so these 80 trial structures give rise to only 40 clearly different structures .",
    "this is seen in fig.([fig : fig5 ] ) , where the plateaus in the energy curve correspond to this `` lumping '' of several initial geometries into a single geometry .",
    "this transformation typically takes place by a displacement of the surface bilayer as a whole , thus changing its registry with the underlying substrate , or by the movement of a vacancy to a neighboring position ( using our notation this corresponds to a transformation ( .. , 0,1,2 , .. ) @xmath18 ( .. , 1,0,2 , .. ) ) .",
    "this happens for example in the case of the ( 1,2,2,1,1,0,4,1,1 ) initial structure , that transforms into a configuration that is better described with the label ( 1,2,0,2,1,1,4,1,1 ) and is one of the most stable structures .",

    "of course , there are important differences between the relative energies calculated using the minimal basis and constrained relaxations ( @xmath12 scheme ) , and those obtained from the fully relaxed structures using dzp basis sets ( @xmath16 scheme ) .",
    "however , the overall trend of increasing energy is recovered with the more accurate calculations .",
    "we also observe in this case that several initial geometries give rise to the same or very similar final structures .",

    "the presence of a surface dislocation is necessary to recover the bulk stacking disrupted by the hc .",
    "the position of the gold atom seems reasonable , gold should be a better option than silicon to sit at the dislocation since gold does not exhibit strong directional bonding .",
    "however , using a more complete basis set ( already a dz basis gives the correct result ) and a thicker slab the f2 , f3 and f4 geometries become the most favorable structures ( they are almost degenerate and @xmath314  mev / @xmath29 more stable than f1 ) .",
    "this points to the importance of using more complete ( and thus flexible ) basis sets when the coordination of the surface atoms departs from simple @xmath17 hybridization ( like in the case of the hc structure or at the surface dislocations ) .",

    "these bands are also present for both models . however , while in the case of the f4 structure the step - edge band is completely filled and the dangling - bond band is empty  @xcite , in the case of the f2 model these two bands cross and the dangling - bond band has a small occupation of @xmath33 electrons closer to the experimental observation .",
    "the population of the different bands can be roughly understood taking into account the larger electron affinity of gold and the hc structure  @xcite as compared to other atoms in the surface .",

    "the differences between the f2 and f4 structures are more subtle .",
    "these two models only differ in the position of the surface dislocation . energetically",

    "in the case of the f2 model the dislocation involves the gold atoms and some of the silicon atoms of the hc structure .",
    "this increases slightly the energy of the bands associated with the hc and , as a consequence , the step - edge band transfers some of its population to the dangling - bond band .",

    "this splitting is not observed in the experiments .",
    "secondly , the theoretical band structure has one extra band not seen in photoemission .",
    "this band is associated with the hc structure at the step - edge edge and has its minimum at @xmath35 , contrary to the case of the other two bands .",

    "[ fig : fig10 ] we show the simulated stm images at different voltages for the f2 and f4 models . in general",
    "we can say that the comparison with the available experimental data is satisfactory . in agreement with the experimental images",
    "@xcite the most prominent feature is the step edge . within the terrace",
    "we find signals coming from the row of gold atoms and its neighboring hc structure .",
    "the gold chain is seen as a continuous line for occupied states and presents more structure for empty states . for both positive and negative voltages we can also distinguish a signal coming from the unsaturated silicon dangling bond in the terrace close to the step edge .",
    "the step edge and the gold chain could be identified with the two parallel chains reported by snijders _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in their recent experiment , they observe a strong polarity despendence in the stm images , and in particular , find zigzag structures for empty states and ladder configurations for filled states . in figures [ fig : fig9 ] and [ fig : fig10 ] we have sketched some possible candidates for this kind of behaviour . for f2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) , the ladder structure in filled states could result from the registry of the step - edge with respect to the gold atoms .",

    "[ fig : fig10 ] ) , we can identify two entities that change their registries when going from filled to empty states .",
    "they are the step - edge and the complex formed by au and the surface dislocation .",
    "they show , similar to the experiment , ladder and zigzag configurations respectively for filled and empty states .",
    "we first explore two models of the si(553 ) stepped silicon surface where the terraces are fully covered by a ( 2@xmath11 ) @xmath0-bonded chain reconstruction .",
    "they correspond to two slightly different arrangements of the @xmath0-bonded chain ( fig  [ fig : fig11 ] ) . our most stable geometry ( model p0 )",

    "[ tab : tab2 ] . in several cases",

    "these changes are also summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab2 ] .",
    "model p4 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12 ] , is the most stable structure .",
    "the @xmath0-bonded chain where the gold substitution takes place transforms into a structure similar to the unreconstructed si(111 ) surface .",

    "@xcite    the next most favorable model , p2 , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] .",
    "again the @xmath0-bonded chain where the substitution took place has disappeared . however , this time a configuration reminiscent of the hc structure has formed in the middle of the terrace .",
    "this transformation is accompanied by an expansion of the surface bilayer ( see the forward movement of the step - edge atoms in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig13 ] ) .    the band structure calculated for the p2 model , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ]  ( c ) , presents similar characteristics to the experimental band structure ( see the previous section ) .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ]  ( c ) that the p2 model presents two metallic dispersive bands centered at point k in the zone boundary .",
    "one of theses bands is associated with the si - au bonds between gold and the neighboring silicon atoms in the step edge .",
    "it has a considerable gold weight and , therefore , is expected to exhibit a splitting if the spin - orbit coupling is taken into account . the other band ,",
    "however , is mainly derived from the unsaturated dangling bonds of the silicon atoms at the step edge and presents a smaller filling .",
    "as expected , the @xmath0-bonded chain structure that remains in the terrace does not give rise to any metallic band .",
    "the electron pocket of the step - edge band around k has an occupation of @xmath311/4 , quite close to that found in the experiment .",
    "there is another small electron pocket associated with the step - edge around @xmath35 which is not observed in the experiment .",
    "thus we can assign a population of @xmath310.4 to the surface bands with a larger weight in the step - edge atoms .",
    "the dispersive band with a mixed silicon - gold character has an occupation of @xmath310.6 electrons .",
    "therefore , the total population associated with the step - edge derived surface bands is one .",
    "this is somewhat surprising if we take into account that the si atoms at the step - edge have , in principle , three electrons to populate these surface bands .",
    "however , one of these electrons is transferred to the au 6@xmath4 states ( which appear several ev below e@xmath34 ) and the other electron populates states with large contribution from the hc structure ( which does not exhibit any metallic band ) .",
    "further investigation of the p2 model reveals that it is a metastable configuration .",
    "performing the relaxations with a more stringent force tolerance of 0.01 ev /    results in a more stable structure .",
    "this structure , labelled p2@xmath37 and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] , exhibits a strong rebonding of the step edge .",
    "the @xmath0-bonded chain suffers a small translation along the @xmath38 $ ] direction in order to saturate the dangling bonds at the step edge .",
    "the new position of the atoms of the @xmath0-bonded chain seems to be a compromise between creating a surface dislocation and saturating the dangling bonds at the step edge .",
    "the band structure , shown in fig .  [ fig : fig14 ]  ( c ) , is quite similar to that of the p2 model .",
    "the role of the step - edge atoms is now played by the silicon atoms that formed the @xmath0-bonded chain .",
    "a quite dispersive surface band , coming from these atoms , appears centered at k. another dispersive band with a strong gold weight appears at lower energies .",
    "although the topology of the band structure resembles that observed in the experiment , the filling of the parabolic silicon band is in this case close 0.4 , i.e. larger than that observed experimentally .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ]  ( c ) also highlights one of the bands associated with the hc structure , showing a characteristic dispersion .",
    "@xcite    the band structure of model p2@xmath37 , calculated using vasp and including the spin - orbit interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ]  ( a ) ) shows quite good , although not perfect agreement , with the experiments . as in the case of the f2 model ( see above ) , due to the spin - orbit interaction the dispersive bands suffer a splitting proportional to their weight in the gold atoms in the surface .",
    "thus , the splitting is much larger for the dispersive band starting at lower energies .",
    "again , in contradiction with the experimental observations we find some degree of splitting also for the parabolic band appearing at higher energies , although this splitting is smaller .",
    "the overall conclusion from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ]  ( a ) is that the p2@xmath37 outperforms the f2 model in terms of reproducing the photoemission results .",
    "the simulated stm images for this structural model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15 ] .",
    "the dependence on the polarity seems to be much larger than for models f2 and f4 .",
    "the structure of the stm images becomes more complex when going from filled to empty states as several `` spots '' appear and the identification of zigzag or ladder - like structures becomes quite arbitrary .",
    "models p4 and p5 exhibit a similar rebonding of the step edge as explained above in the case of p2 and p2@xmath39 . however , these new geometries , p4@xmath37 and p5@xmath37 , are not as stable as p2@xmath37 ( see tab .  [",

    "these two classes of models have different number of atoms . in order to compare the relative surface energies we need to define the chemical potential of silicon .",
    "since the surface should be in equilibrium with bulk , we have chosen the chemical potential equal to the total energy of a silicon atom in bulk .",

    "we have presented a comprehensive study of the structure of the si(553)-au reconstruction .",
    "we have considered reconstructions restricted to the topmost bilayer and studied two possible types : ( a )  flat \" surface - bilayer models , where the atoms at the topmost bilayer present different coordinations and different registries with the underlying bulk , and ( b ) nine different models based on substitutions silicon by gold in different positions of a @xmath0-bonded chain reconstruction of the si(553 ) surface .",
    "although the unreconstructed si(553 ) surface has nine inequivalent atomic positions , within the familiy of the  flat \" surface - bilayer models , we have focused on structures containing only eight atoms ( seven silicon and one gold atoms ) in the topmost bilayer .",
    "we found in previous investigations that this was crucial to reduce the number of dangling bonds in the final structures and to facilitate the appearance of the so - called honeycomb - chain structure  @xcite .",
    "the honeycomb - chain has been proposed by us  @xcite and by other authors  @xcite as one of the key ingredients of the reconstructions induced by gold on si(111 ) vicinal surfaces and the results presented here seem to confirm this idea .    we have developed a compact notation that allows us to label and identify all the structures .",
    "this notation is instrumental for the automatic generation of trial geometries and for counting the number of inequivalent structures , i.e. , having different bonding topologies .",
    "there are several thousands of flat surface - bilayers models with eight inequivalent positions in the topmost bilayer , however , applying a few physically motivated constraints we obtained only 210 different models .",
    "all these structures , along with those based on a @xmath0-bonded reconstruction of the terraces of the si(553 ) surface , have been studied using first - principles density functional calculations with the siesta code .",
    "an iterative procedure , with a step - by - step increase of the accuracy and computational cost of the calculations , was used to allow for the study of this large number of configurations .",
