    "traditional observations of binary systems are carried out using photometric and spectroscopic methodics .",
    "the former gives the time dependence of brightness in a specific band @xmath4 and the latter can give the time dependence of wavelength of some doppler - shifted line @xmath5 .",
    "given ephemeris @xmath6 is known , the dependencies @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be converted with the help of doppler formula to the light curve @xmath7 and phase dependency of radial velocity @xmath8 .    during last ten years the observations of binary systems in the form of trailed spectrograms for some emission line @xmath9 or in other terms",
    "@xmath10 become widely used .",
    "a method of doppler tomography @xcite is suited to analyze the trailed spectrograms .",
    "this method provides obtaining a map of luminosity in the 2d velocity space from the orbital variability of emission lines intensity .",
    "the doppler tomogram is constructed as a conversion of time resolved ( i.e. phase - folded ) line profiles into a map on ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) plane . to convert the distribution @xmath10 to doppler map @xmath13 we should use the expression for radial velocity as a projection of velocity vector on the line of sight , i.e. @xmath14 ( here we assume that @xmath15 , the minus sign before @xmath11 is for consistency with the coordinate system ) , and solve an inverse problem that is described by integral equation ( see appendix a of @xcite ) :    @xmath16 where @xmath17 is normalized local line profile shape ( e.g. , a dirac @xmath18-function ) , and the limits of integration are from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "this inverse problem is ill - posed and special regularization is necessary for its solving ( e.g. maximum entropy method @xcite , fourier filtered back projection @xcite , fast maximum entropy method @xcite , etc . , see also @xcite ) . as a result",
    "we obtain a map of distribution of specific line intensity in velocity space .",
    "this map is easier to interpret than original line profiles , moreover , the tomogram can show ( or at least gives a hint to ) some features of flow structure . in particular , the double - peaked line profiles corresponding to circular motion of the gas ( e.g. in accretion disk ) become a diffuse ring - shaped region in this map . resuming , we can say that components of binary system can be resolved in velocity space while they can not be spatially resolved through direct observations , so the doppler tomography technique is a rather power tool for studying of binary systems .",
    "unfortunately the reconstruction of spatial distribution of intensity on the basis of doppler map is an ambiguous problem since points located far from each other may have equal radial velocities and deposit to the same pixel on the doppler map .",
    "so the transformation @xmath21 is impossible without some _ a priori _ assumptions on the velocity field .",
    "the situation changes drastically when one uses gas dynamical calculations alongside with doppler tomography technique . in this case",
    "we are not need to cope with the inverse problem since the task is solved directly : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "difficulties can arise when converting the spatial distributions of density and temperature @xmath24 , @xmath25 into the distribution of luminosity of specific emission line @xmath26 .",
    "for thick lines the formation of line profile should be described by radiation transfer equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , therefore to make our preliminary synthetic doppler maps we assume that the matter is optically thin . as a first approximation",
    "we adopt the line luminosity as @xmath27 and as @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we also should emphasize the complexity of doppler maps analysis for eclipsing binaries ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the synthetic doppler map produces the line emissions from any site of binary and suggests that they are visible at all orbital phases , in other words there are no eclipses and occultations of emission regions .",
    "clearly , eclipsing systems violates that assumption .",
    "usually , when dealing with observations , the eclipsed parts of trailed spectrograms are naturally excluded from input data for construction of doppler tomograms . but",
    "conversion of gas dynamical simulation results into doppler maps suggests using of _ full _ set of data .",
    "thus when analyzing of synthetic doppler maps for eclipsing binaries we should take in mind that some features can be occulted on some phases even for optically thin case .",
    "the full description of the used 3d gas dynamical model can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we pay attention only to the main features of the model .",
    "let us consider the semidetached binary system with mass of accretor @xmath29 , mass of donor - star @xmath30 , separation @xmath31 , and velocity of orbital rotation @xmath32 .",
    "these parameters are connected by third kepler s low @xmath33 . to describe the gas flow in this binary system we used the 3d system of euler equations .",
    "the calculations were carried out in the non - inertial cartesian coordinate system rotating with the binary system . to close the system of equations",
    ", we used the equation of state of ideal gas @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the ratio of heat capacities . to mimic the system with radiative losses , we accept in the model the value of adiabatic index close to unit : @xmath36",
    ", that corresponds to the case close to the isothermal one @xcite .    to obtain numerical solution of the system of equations we used the roe  osher tvd scheme of a high approximation order @xcite with einfeldt modification @xcite .",
    "the original system of equations was written in a dimensionless form .",
    "to do this , the spatial variables were normalized to the distance between the components @xmath31 , the time variables were normalized to the reciprocal angular velocity of the system @xmath37 , and the density was normalized to its value in the inner lagrangian point @xmath38 .",
    "we adopted the computational domain as a parallepipedon @xmath39\\times[-\\slantfrac{1}{2}a\\ldots \\slantfrac{1}{2}a]\\times[0\\ldots \\slantfrac{1}{4}a]$ ] ( due to the symmetry of the problem calculations were conducted only in the top half - space ) .",
    "a sphere with a radius of @xmath40 representing the accretor was cut out of the calculation domain .",
    "the boundary conditions were taken as ` free outflow ' on the accretor star and on the outer edges of computational domain . in gridpoint corresponding to @xmath38 we injected the matter with parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a gas speed of sound in @xmath38 point . as the initial conditions we used rarefied gas with the following parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "analysis of considered problem shows that the gas dynamical solution is defined by three dimensionless parameters [ 1618 ] : mass ratio @xmath48 , lubow - shu parameter @xmath49 @xcite , and adiabatic index @xmath35 .",
    "the value of adiabatic index was discussed above and we used the value @xmath50 .",
    "analysis of our previous results @xcite shows that the main characteristic features of 3d gas dynamical flow structure are qualitatively the same in wide range of parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "therefore for model simulation we chose them as follows : @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the results of calculations will be presented in coordinate system ( see fig .",
    "1 ) which is widely used in doppler mapping .",
    "the origin of coordinates is located in the center of the accretor , ` @xmath55'-axis is directed along the line connecting the centers of stars , from accretor to the mass - losing component , ` @xmath56'-axis is directed along the axis of rotation , and ` @xmath57'-axis is determined so that we obtain a right - hand coordinate system ( i.e. ` @xmath57'-axis points in the direction of orbital movement of the donor - star ) . in fig .  1 we put digits showing the phase angles of the observer in binary system .",
    "we also show a critical roche lobe with shadowed donor - star and ballistic trajectory of a particle moving from @xmath38 point to accretor .    the morphology of gaseous flows in considered binary system can be evaluated from figs  2 , 3 and 4 . in fig .",
    "2 the distribution of density over the equatorial plane and velocity vectors are presented . in this figure",
    "we also put a gas dynamical trajectory of a particle moving from @xmath38 to accretor ( a white line with circles ) and a gas dynamical trajectory passing through the shock wave along the stream edge ( a red line with squares , see also fig .",
    "6 ) . in fig .  3 we present the so called texture figure in equatorial plane which is visualization of velocity vectors field using line integral convolution method @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 the similar texture is presented for @xmath58 slice along a blue line in fig .",
    "empty region in fig .  4 corresponds to cross - section of the stream .",
    "analysis of presented results as well as our previous studies @xcite show the significant influence of rarefied gas of circumbinary envelope on the flow patterns in semidetached binaries .",
    "the gas of circumbinary envelope interacts with the stream of matter and deflects it .",
    "this leads , in particular , to the shock - free ( tangential ) interaction between the stream and the outer edge of forming accretion disc , and , as the consequence , to the absence of ` hot spot ' in the disc . at the same time",
    "it is seen , that the interaction of the gas of circumbinary envelope with the stream results in the formation of an extended shock wave located along the stream edge ( ` hot line ' ) . from figs  2 and 3",
    "it also seen that spiral shock tidally induced by donor - star appears ( dotted line in fig .  2 ) .",
    "appearance of tidally induced two - armed spiral shock was discovered by matsuda @xcite . here",
    "we see only one - armed spiral shock . in the place where the second arm should be we see the strong gas dynamical interaction of circumbinary envelope with the stream causing the formation of rather intensive shock along the outer edge of the stream .",
    "this gas dynamically induced shock probably prevents the formation of second arm of tidally induced spiral shock .",
    "an analysis of the flow structure in @xmath58 plane ( fig .",
    "4 ) shows that a part of the circumstellar envelope interacts with the ( denser ) original gas stream and is deflected away from the orbital plane .",
    "this naturally leads to the formation of ` halo ' .",
    "following to @xcite , one can define ` halo ' as that matter which : i ) encircles the accretor being gravitationally captured ; ii ) does not belong to the accretion disc ; iii ) interacts with the stream ( collides with it and/or overflows it ) ; iv ) after the interaction either becomes a part of the accretion disc or leaves the system .",
    "described gas dynamical features of flow structure are good candidates to be observed using doppler mapping technique .",
    "the doppler maps show the distribution of luminosity in the velocity space .",
    "each point of flow has a three - dimensional vector of velocity @xmath59 in observer s ( inertial ) frame . in the case when observer is located in the orbital plane of the binary the doppler map s",
    "coordinate @xmath60 will coincide with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . to define these coordinates for the case of inclined system we have to find a projection of vector @xmath63 on the plane constituted by vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath64 is a direction from the observer to binary .",
    "the line emissivity in the velocity space can be written as :    @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69  inclination angle .",
    "usually @xmath70 in the most dense parts of the flow therefore we can neglect the third component of velocity @xmath71 .",
    "this assumption allows us to take off ` @xmath72 ' beyond the integral and to simplify the expression . using @xmath73 and @xmath74 as coordinates for doppler map will hide the dependency on the inclination angle .",
    "the adopted dimensionless coordinate system for doppler maps is shown in fig .",
    "we also put in fig .  5 digits ( the same as in fig .",
    "1 ) showing the phase angles of observer in binary system .",
    "the transformation of the donor - star from spatial to velocity coordinate system is very simple as it is fixed in the corotating frame .",
    "every point @xmath75 fixed in the binary frame has a velocity @xmath76 in corotation frame .",
    "this is linear in the perpendicular distance from the rotation axis and therefore the shape of the donor - star projected on the orbital plane is preserved ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "since the velocity of each point of donor - star is perpendicular to the radius vector , all points of donor - star are rotated by 90@xmath77 counter - clockwise between the spatial ( see fig .  1 ) and velocity coordinate diagrams @xcite .",
    "figure  5 depicts in velocity coordinates a critical roche lobe with shadowed donor - star and ballistic trajectory of a particle moving from @xmath38 to accretor . on the velocity plane",
    "the accretor has coordinates ( 0,@xmath78 ) , where @xmath79 or in dimensionless form ( for adopted value of @xmath53 ) @xmath80 .",
    "as it was mentioned earlier we used both @xmath27 and @xmath81 to build synthetic doppler maps . the synthetic doppler map calculated with @xmath27",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "this map shows the intensity integrated over the @xmath56-coordinate , i.e. taking into account all @xmath56-layers of computational grid .",
    "figure  7 presents the doppler map corresponding to @xmath81 .",
    "the comparison of results presented in figs  6 and 7 shows that all characteristic features are the same for different prescriptions of @xmath82 , therefore for further analysis we will use results for @xmath27 .    for the sake of comparison we have marked different features of flow structure and put these marks both in spatial and on velocity coordinates .",
    "let us consider results presented in figs  2 and 6 . as it follows from these figures stream from @xmath38 ( first part of curve marked by white line with circles ) transforms to a spiral arm in the 2-nd and 3-d quadrants of the doppler map . shock wave caused by interaction of circumbinary envelope with the stream",
    "is located along the stream edge in spatial coordinates .",
    "three last points ( marked by larger symbols ) of curves with circles and squares in fig .",
    "2 are the examples of two flowlines passing through the shock .",
    "the position of this shock on doppler map is an spiral arm starting approximately from the center of donor - star in the direction of negative @xmath11 .",
    "this arm lies above the arm caused by stream from @xmath38 .    to analyze other features",
    "we have marked the corresponding sites both in spatial and velocity coordinates ( see fig .",
    "this comparison is a straightforward problem since we simply choose from all sites of gas dynamical flow structure those that fall in specific places on the doppler map and mark them .",
    "it is seen that tidally induced spiral shock ( dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) or more precisely the dense post - shock zone ( blue squares in fig .",
    "8a ) produces bright arm in the first quadrant of doppler map .",
    "it is important to note that gas of circumbinary envelope overflowing the stream ( cyan diamonds and green up triangles ) significantly increase the luminosity of the zone of doppler map located below the zone corresponding to the stream .",
    "analysis of other features can be conducted by comparison of figs  8a and 8b as well ( magenta circles , yellow stars and red asterisks ) .",
    "doppler tomography of binaries is widely and actively used now . since pioneer work by marsh and horne @xcite a lot of doppler map observations were made ( see , e.g. , [ 2528 ] ) . just to give to reader the idea on observable doppler maps we present here in fig .",
    "9 two doppler maps of heii  @xmath83   for ip peg obtained by morales - rueda , marsh and billington @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional gas dynamical simulations of flow structure in semidetached binaries allow to build synthetic doppler maps . in turn",
    "it gives a possibility to identify main features of the flow on the doppler map without solution of ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "comparison of synthetic tomograms with observations makes possible both to refine the gas dynamical model and to interpret the observational data .",
