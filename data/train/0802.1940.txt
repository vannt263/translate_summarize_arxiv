    "laboratory analyses of primitive solar system materials , such as meteorites , interplanetary dust particles ( idps ) , and cometary dust particles returned by the _ stardust _ mission , show anomalous fractionation in the heavy isotopes of numerous elements relative to that expected from the cosmic or solar system values ( clayton & nittler 2004 ; lodders & amari 2005 ; alexander et al.2007 ; mckeegan et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the case of hydrogen and nitrogen ,",
    "the large d / h and /  ratios observed in some phases have been attributed to the survival of d- and -enriched material from the interstellar medium ( ism ; alexander et al .",
    "1998 ; messenger 2000 ) . for deuterium ,",
    "the observed ratios are consistent with models and observations of the ism , where low - temperature ion - molecule reactions lead to enhanced d / h ratios in both gas- and solid - phase species ( e.g.  millar , bennett & herbst 1989 ; charnley , tielens & rodgers 1997 . )",
    "however , there is little observational data on nitrogen isotope ratios in the ism , and models of the  fractionation in typical dense clouds predict modest enhancements of @xmath7  per cent ( terzieva & herbst 2000 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the largest enhancements detected in meteorites  in so - called ` hotspots '  have /  enhancements of more than a factor of four relative to the earth ( i.e.  @xmath8  $ ] where @xmath9 is the terrestrial isotopic ratio of 0.003678 ( de bivre et al .",
    "1996 ) ] ; busemann et al .",
    "values of @xmath10   have also been found in hotspots in idps and _ stardust _ samples ( floss et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; mckeegan et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in an earlier paper we demonstrated",
    "that significantly increased fractionation can occur when co is depleted onto dust grains ( charnley & rodgers 2002 [ paper i ] ) .",
    "the key fractionation reactions are : @xmath11 where the exothermicities are @xmath12  k and @xmath13  k ( terzieva & herbst 2000 ) .",
    "these preferentially drive into molecular nitrogen , at the expense of atomic n@xmath14 which becomes isotopically light . in a standard dark cloud model",
    "the degree of fractionation is limited by chemical reactions which cycle nitrogen between atomic and molecular form ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bubble ] ) .",
    "however , if co is frozen out as ice , oh is unavailable , this cycle is broken , and much larger -enhancements are possible . in this scenario ,",
    "degradation of the ( -enriched ) n@xmath3 by he@xmath4 is essentially a one - way process .",
    "the n@xmath14 atoms released by this reaction remain in the gas , whereas the n@xmath4 ions react rapidly with h@xmath3 in a sequence of reactions to form ammonium ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bubble ] ) .",
    "the nh@xmath15 ions then recombine with electrons , producing nh@xmath3 and nh@xmath16 , which subsequently freeze out on the dust grains .",
    "if the solid - phase nh@xmath3 radicals are hydrogenated to nh@xmath16 , as expected from models of grain surface chemistry ( brown & charnley 1990 ) , the end result is a large abundance of isotopically heavy ammonia ice . at late times in this model , when @xmath17 , the efficiency of reactions ( [ frac1 ] ) and ( [ frac2 ] ) are greatly increased , leading to much larger gas - phase /  ratios than in the standard dense cloud chemistry .",
    "ultimately , we found that the ammonia ice is enhanced in  by a factor of 1.8 .    ) and ( [ frac2]).,width=259 ]    this model could account for the presence of high bulk @xmath18 values in idps ( messenger 2000 ) , and was also able to account for the non - detection of  in comets .",
    "some additional processing was indicated to incorporate the @xmath19-enriched ammonia into the carbonaceous matter , and secondary energetic processing to add @xmath20 side - groups to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules was suggested .",
    "recent meteoritic studies have confirmed that most of the @xmath21 enrichment in idps is carried by amine side - groups on aromatic moeties ( keller et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , the model was unable to reproduce the largest  values seen in the hotspots . moreover , the experimental determination by geppert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that recombination of preferentially breaks the n@xmath22n bond , producing n@xmath14 and nh , acts to suppress the maximum fractionation ( rodgers & charnley 2004 [ paper ii ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we are motivated to revisit our previous models as a result of several recent discoveries .",
    "firstly , the experimental results of geppert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have been challenged by molek et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who demonstrated that recombination of n@xmath3h@xmath4 leads predominantly to @xmath23 , as indicated in previous work ( adams et al .  1991 ) .",
    "the new results indicate that rupture of the n@xmath3 bond occurs rarely , if at all , with an upper limit for the @xmath24 branching ratio of 5 per cent .",
    "secondly , observations of several pre - stellar cores have revealed that they have temperatures below 10  k in their central , densest regions , as expected from physical models ( evans et al .",
    "2001 ; zucconi , walmsley & galli 2001 ) .",
    "for example , crapsi et al .  ( 2007 ) derived @xmath25  k in l1544 , and pagani et al.(2007 ) found @xmath26  k in l134n .",
    "due to the small zero - point energy changes associated with  fractionation , reactions ( [ frac1 ] ) and ( [ frac2 ] ) are extremely sensitive to temperature , and these lower temperatures may be expected to yield larger /  ratios .",
    "thirdly , observations of  in dark clouds imply  abundances of a few @xmath27 ( womack , ziurys & wyckoff 1992 ; maret , bergin & lada 2006 ) .",
    "this is significantly less than the galactic elemental nitrogen abundance and maret et al .",
    "proposed that the ` missing ' nitrogen was in atomic form . although the chemical model of maret et al .",
    "assumed the geppert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) branching ratios for n@xmath3h@xmath4 recombination , models assuming the ` old ' branching ratio also predict @xmath28 at early times ( e.g.  pineau des forts , roueff & flower 1990 ) .",
    "this is because @xmath29 conversion occurs via neutral - neutral reactions , and the time - scale for this process , @xmath30 , is larger than the dynamical free - fall time , @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , co is formed fairly rapidly by ion - molecule chemistry , on a time - scale @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we would expect young clouds to have high co abundances but relatively small @xmath34 ratios .",
    "this is consistent with the view that molecular clouds and pre - stellar cores form rapidly , on a time - scale of order a few times the free - fall time ( ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "dynamical - chemical models of collapsing clouds show that @xmath35 conversion is never efficient over @xmath31 ( brown , charnley & millar 1988 ) .",
    "as discussed above , a large n@xmath14/  ratio is necessary to produce substantial -fractionation , so if the nitrogen in dense clouds is in fact mainly atomic rather than molecular , this will have important consequences for the /  ratios .",
    "finally , in our earlier work we only calculated the bulk isotope ratios in the ammonia ice .",
    "in reality , the grain mantles will have an ` onion - ring'-like structure consisting of sequentially accreted monolayers .",
    "thus , temporal variations in the gas - phase /ratios will be preserved as spatial gradients in the ices , with each layer recording the gas - phase ratio at the time it was accreted . in particular , the late - accreting , uppermost layers will be the most highly fractionated . as it is these layers which are likely to experience the largest degree of subsequent processing , it is necessary to distinguish between the bulk isotope ratios in the ice as a whole , and those in specific monolayers .",
    "we utilize the same chemical model as in our previous work ( papers i & ii ) .",
    "the -fractionation chemistry is based on terzieva & herbst ( 2000 ) ; a list of the reactions and the rate coefficients we have adopted appeared in paper ii .",
    "we consider a high density core ( @xmath36  @xmath37 ) with temperatures of 5 , 7 , and 10  k , and a cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath38  s@xmath39 . the elemental /  ratio in each model is generally assumed to be 1/400 , although the effects of using other values were also investigated .",
    "a key parameter is the branching ratio for the dissociative recombination of : @xmath40 we considered values for @xmath41 , 0.02 , and 0.05 , based on the experimental results of molek et al .",
    "we use elemental abundances for c , o , and n of 140 , 290 , and 80 parts per million respectively , relative to hydrogen ( savage & sembach 1996 ) , and assume complete depletion of metals . all the carbon is initially in the form of co , and the remaining oxygen is atomic .    as before",
    ", we assume that co freezes out onto grains with a sticking coefficient of unity , whereas n and n@xmath3 remain in the gas .",
    "the reason for this selective depletion of co versus n@xmath3 is controversial , as laboratory experiments reveal that the two species have similar binding energies ( berg et al .",
    "nevertheless , observations of pre - stellar cores show ample evidence for the presence of n@xmath3-rich , co - poor regions toward the centers of these objects ( bergin & tafalla 2007 ) . due to their low polarizabilities , atoms should have the lowest binding energies for physisorption to icy dust grains .",
    "reaction with an h atom forms a simple hydride that can stick more effectively due to hydrogen bonding with the substrate .",
    "thus , we assume that o atoms are hydrogenated on the grains to form water ice .",
    "conversely , recent laboratory experiments indicate a very low efficiency for the reaction of n@xmath14 and h on ice surfaces ( t hiraoka , private communication ) , which supports our assumption that n atoms do not stick .    we have adapted our model to track the /  ratios as successive monolayers ( ml ) of ammonia ice are accreted .",
    "a ` typical ' interstellar grain of size 0.1  @xmath42",
    "m has @xmath43 surface sites , and an abundance relative to hydrogen of @xmath44 .",
    "hence , one ml corresponds to a total solid phase abundance of @xmath45 , and our elemental n abundance corresponds to a maximum of 80 ml of ice , assuming that all the nitrogen freezes out as nh@xmath16 ( or nh@xmath3 ) .",
    "in fact , a large fraction of the nitrogen remains in the gas phase in the form of n@xmath14 , and we typically find that we form @xmath46  ml of ammonia ice .",
    "we began by investigating the importance of the branching ratio , @xmath47 , in the recombination of .",
    "we found only very small differences in the results of models with @xmath47 equal to 5 , 2 , and 0 per cent , and conclude that , as long as @xmath48 , the presence of channel ( [ br2 ] ) does not significantly affect the  chemistry .",
    "we then varied the elemental nitrogen isotope ratio , using values for /  of 800 , 400 , and 100 . in every case ,",
    "the  enhancements are identical , relative to the underlying ratio .",
    "henceforth , we discuss models with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .      , 7 , and 5  k respectively.,width=307 ]    figure [ fig : nn2 ] shows the abundances of the three main repositories of nitrogen  gaseous n@xmath14 and n@xmath3 , and solid nh@xmath16  as a function of time , assuming that all of the nitrogen is initially present as n@xmath3 .",
    "the overall nitrogen chemistry is the same at 10  k and 7  k : n@xmath3 is degraded on a time - scale @xmath51  myr . at late times just over half of the total nitrogen is in the gas phase as atoms , and just under half has frozen out as ammonia ice . at 5  k , however , very little ice is formed , due to the endo - ergocity of the reaction @xmath52 we have assumed an activation energy barrier of 85  k for this reaction , based on the value in the umist reaction rate database ( woodall et al .  2007 ) . at 5  k ,",
    "the reaction becomes so slow that radiative recombination becomes the dominant loss route for n@xmath4 ions , and only small amounts of gas - phase nh@xmath3 and nh@xmath16 are produced . in effect , the barrier for reaction ( [ eqn : n+h2 ] ) sets a limit on the nitrogen chemistry in that , as the temperature drops , it eventually becomes too cold to produce ammonia . in extremely cold cores",
    "the chemistry simply transforms the initial gas - phase n@xmath3 into gas - phase n@xmath14 . in the following ,",
    "we therefore look at the fractionation in 7  k and 10  k gas .        figure  [ fig : tfrac]a shows the fractionation in the most important molecules .",
    "the results for 10  k gas are similar to those shown in paper i , whereas at 7  k significantly larger peak /  ratios are found in gas - phase nh@xmath16 and n@xmath3 . at early times , the gas - phase ammonia formed at 7  k is actually _ depleted _ in .",
    "this is due to the reduced rate of reaction ( [ eqn : n+h2 ] ) which leads to a much larger n@xmath4 abundance than at 10  k. these n@xmath4 ions undergo isotope - exchange reactions with n@xmath3 ( freysinger et al .",
    "1994 ) : @xmath53 where @xmath54  k ( terzieva & herbst 2000 ) .",
    "this reaction shuffles  back into n@xmath3 , reducing the -fractionation in n@xmath4 and thus ammonia . at late times",
    ", this effect is still suppressing the n@xmath4 fractionation relative to n@xmath3 , but the enormous -enhancements in n@xmath3 ensures that n@xmath4 and nh@xmath16 are more fractionated than at 10  k. in terms of the bulk /  ratio in the ammonia ice , both the 10  k and 7  k models predict similar enhancements of @xmath55 .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , the time evolution of the isotope ratios will be preserved in the layered structure of the ices . even though the overall icy /  ratios are the same in both models , ammonia ices which accreted at 7  k will have a more heterogeneous structure , with the innermost layers depleted in , but with the top layers enhanced by factors @xmath56 .",
    "significant fractionation in n@xmath3 can only occur when n@xmath3 is not the dominant nitrogen carrier . in the models discussed so far , this occurs at late times when most of the n@xmath3 has been broken down by he@xmath4 attack , on time - scales @xmath57 .",
    "however , if a substantial fraction of the nitrogen is initially atomic , enhanced /  ratios can be produced on much shorter time - scales .",
    "the n@xmath14/n@xmath3 ratio at @xmath58 depends on the dynamical and chemical history of the cloud before the formation of the dense pre - stellar core , and can be taken as a free parameter in our model . to investigate the importance of this factor ,",
    "we have considered three additional models , where the initial fraction of n in molecular form is taken to be 0.6 , 0.1 , and 0 .",
    "the latter case , where all of the nitrogen is initially atomic , is not particularly realistic , but was used to constrain the amount of n@xmath3 that can be synthesized from n@xmath14 in the limited time available before co etc .",
    "freeze out .",
    "we find that this produces only very small n@xmath3 abundances , @xmath59 per cent of the total nitrogen .",
    "this means that the available pool of n@xmath3  roughly half of which will end up as ammonia ice  is essentially equal to the n@xmath3 abundance at @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig : tfrac]b and [ fig : tfrac]c shows the isotope chemistry when a large fraction of the original nitrogen is atomic .",
    "qualitatively , the gas - phase  and nh@xmath16 fractionation is similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : tfrac]a , except that the peak /  ratios occur much earlier as the initial n@xmath3 abundance is reduced .",
    "as before , we find that the upper layers of the ice should be enhanced in  by an order of magnitude . in terms of the overall bulk isotope ratio in the ice ,",
    "it is clear that much larger values result , with @xmath61 when only ten per cent of the initial nitrogen is molecular .",
    "this is due to the fact that less ammonia ice is formed overall , so the highly - fractionated upper layers account for a greater proportion of the total ice .",
    "we find roughly the same peak ratios regardless of the initial n@xmath14/n@xmath3 ratio , but in models with more n@xmath3 the bulk fractionation is diluted by the large number of monolayers which accrete at early times with essentially normal ( or even reduced in the 7  k model ) /  ratios .",
    "we have calculated the /  in successive ml as they accrete from the gas .",
    "for comparison with laboratory measurements , we have converted the isotopic ratios into @xmath5-values relative to the terrestrial /  ratio . in order to do this , we need to know the original /  ratio in the material from which the protosolar nebula ( psn ) was formed .",
    "we assume a value of @xmath62 , which is implied by three independent measurements : jupiter s atmosphere , high - temperature nebular condensates , and the solar wind ( fouchet et al .",
    "2004 ; meibom et al .",
    "2007 ; kallenbach , bamert & hilchenbach 2007 . ) figure [ fig : ml ] shows the @xmath5-values in different ml for several models .",
    "clearly , the upper layers of the ice are the most highly fractionated , with peak values of @xmath63  in every case . also apparent",
    "is the approximate proportionality between the initial n@xmath3 abundance and the total number of ml that accrete .",
    "when only ten per cent of the nitrogen is initially molecular , only four ml of nh@xmath16 ice are formed . however , in this case every ml is very highly fractionated , with @xmath64 everywhere greater than 2000  . as discussed in @xmath65[sec : temp ] , the peak values are larger for @xmath66  k , but the 7  k model also produces a large number of ml at early times that are slightly depleted in .",
    "we have revisited our earlier work on  fractionation based on recent experimental and observation results . using the branching ratios for n@xmath3h@xmath4 dissociative recombination derived by molek et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we effectively recover the results of our earlier work in dense , co - depleted gas at 10  k ( paper i. ) we have investigated the effects of varying the temperature , and show that at lower temperatures , larger /  ratios are produced in gas - phase in n@xmath3 . however , the barrier for the reaction of n@xmath4 ions with h@xmath3 sets a lower limit on the temperature at which ammonia can be produced efficiently . assuming the ` standard ' rate coefficient for this reaction we find that very little ammonia ice is generated for @xmath67  k. we have also looked at the effects of a substantial n@xmath14/n@xmath3 ratio at @xmath60 .",
    "we find that , because roughly half of the initial n@xmath3 ends up in the form of nh@xmath16 and nh@xmath3 , reduced molecular nitrogen abundances yield less ammonia ice in total . smaller n@xmath14/n@xmath3 ratios do not significantly affect the peak gas - phase fractionation ratios , but because the highly - fractionated ammonia formed at late times represents a greater proportion of the total ice , we find that the bulk ice /  ratio can be greatly increased .    following the /  ratios in individual monolayers as they accrete sequentially from the gas , we have shown that gas - phase temporal variations in isotopic ratios are preserved as spatial gradients in the layered ammonia ice .",
    "the uppermost layers which accrete at late times have the largest -enhancements , up to an order of magnitude with respect to the elemental /  ratio . converting to @xmath5-values to compare with laboratory determinations of the isotope ratios in primitive solar system materials , we derive peak values of @xmath68  in gas at 10  k , and values as large as @xmath69  in models with lower temperatures and smaller n@xmath14/n@xmath3 ratios .",
    "this is more than sufficient to account for the largest measured ratios , and demonstrates that interstellar gas - phase chemistry is likely the ultimate source of cometary and meteoritic  anomalies ."
