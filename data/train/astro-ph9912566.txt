    "the improvement in the determination of the angular position of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by the dutch - italian satellite beppo / sax has led to the discovery of extended emission in lower energy photons lasting for days to months , which has revolutionized our understanding of grbs ( cf .",

    "the afterglow emission was predicted prior to their actual discovery by a number of authors ( paczyski & rhoads , 1993 ; meszaros & rees , 1993 ; katz , 1994 ; meszaros & rees 1997 ) based on the calculation of synchrotron emission in a relativistic external shock .",
    "the afterglow observations have been found to be in good agreement with these theoretical predictions ( cf .",
    "sari , 1997 ; vietri , 1997a ; waxman , 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the medium surrounding the exploding object offers some clue as to the nature of the explosion .",
    "vietri ( 1997b ) , and chevalier and li ( 1999a - b ) in two very nice recent papers , have offered evidence that some grb afterglow light curves are best explained by a stratified circumstellar medium which suggests the death of a massive object as the underlying mechanism for gamma - ray burst explosions as was suggested by paczyski ( 1998 ) , and woosley ( 1993 ) .",
    "possible further evidence in support of such a model has come from the flattening and reddening of afterglow emission , a few days after the burst , in optical wavelength bands ( eg . bloom et al .",

    ". 1999 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore the afterglow flux in different models , uniform ism as well as stratified medium , and compare it with observations in a statistical sense , as opposed to comparison with individual grbs as carried out by chevalier and li ( 1999b ) .",
    "we will use this statistical comparison to constrain various physical parameters that determine the afterglow luminosity such as the energy , @xmath3 , the fractional energy in electrons ( @xmath2 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) , the electron energy index ( @xmath5 ) , and the circumstellar density @xmath6 .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the afterglow flux and its distribution and comparison with observations .",
    "consider an explosion which releases an equivalent of isotropic energy @xmath3 in a medium where the density varies as @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the distance from the center of the explosion , and @xmath9 is a constant .",
    "the deacceleration radius , @xmath10 , where the shell starts to slow down as a result of sweeping up the circumstellar material , and the deacceleration time , @xmath11 , in the observer frame are given by    @xmath12^{1/(3-s ) } ,",
    "\\quad\\quad   t_{da } = { r_{da } \\over 4\\beta c ( \\gamma_0/2)^2 } , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta , and @xmath14 is a constant .",
    "the time dependence of the shell radius and the lorentz factor can be obtained from the self - similar relativistic shock solution given in blandford & mckee ( 1976 )    @xmath15    and @xmath0 is the time in observers frame at redshift @xmath16 .",
    "the magnetic field and the electron thermal lorentz factor behind the forward shock vary as ,    @xmath17^{1/2 } ,   \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] and @xmath4 and @xmath2 are the fractional energies in the magnetic field and the electrons , respectively .    using these results",
    "we find that the peak of the synchrotron frequency ( @xmath18 ) and the cooling frequency ( @xmath19 ) , in the observer frame , are    @xmath20 where @xmath21    the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ( in the observer frame ) is given by    @xmath22^{3/5 }              \\epsilon_e^{-3/5 } \\epsilon_b^{3/10 } t_1^{-0.3(4+s)/(4-s ) }              \\left [ \\min(\\nu_m , \\nu_c)\\right]^{-1/5}. \\eqno(6)\\ ] ]    the energy flux at the peak of the spectrum is given by    @xmath23 a\\gamma_0 b_{da } r_{da}^{(3-s ) } \\epsilon_b^{1/2 }      ( 1+z ) t_1^{-s/(8 - 2s ) } , \\eqno(7)\\ ] ] where @xmath24 i.e. for @xmath25 the peak occurs at @xmath19 instead of at @xmath18 .",
    "the equations for @xmath26 are as in chevalier and li ( 1999a - b ) and are given here for easy reference .",
    "the flux at an arbitrary observed frequency @xmath27 can be calculated following sari , piran and narayan ( 1998 ) in terms of @xmath28 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath29 . for the particularly important case of @xmath27 greater than @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "the observed flux is :    @xmath30^{(p+2)/4 } , \\eqno(8)\\ ] ]    note that the flux does not depend on the circumstellar density parameters @xmath9 and @xmath31 when @xmath32 , except through an unimportant multiplicative factor @xmath33 .",
    "the frequencies @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath29 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the afterglow flux for the uniform ism and the wind models only differ when @xmath36 .",
    "since the cooling frequency decreases with time for the uniform ism model and increases with time for the wind model , one of the best ways to distinguish between these models is by observing the behavior of the light - curve when @xmath19 crosses the observed frequency band as has been pointed out by chevalier & li ( 1999 ) .",
    "the predictions and comparison of individual grb lightcurves for the two models will be discussed in some detail in a separate paper .",
    "here we turn our attention to the statistical property of the afterglow light curve in the two models .",
    "the distribution function for grb afterglow flux , @xmath37 , at a frequency @xmath27 , and time @xmath38 is the probability that the afterglow luminosity ( isotropic ) is @xmath39 at time @xmath38 after the explosion ; @xmath27 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are measured in the rest frame of the host galaxy .",
    "the width of @xmath37 is a function of the width of the distribution function for @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "assuming that all these variables are independent gaussian random variables the standard deviation ( sd ) for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , can be obtained from equation ( 8) , when @xmath32 & @xmath18 , and is given by    @xmath42 where @xmath43 ^ 2 , \\eqno(10)\\ ] ] @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mean values of @xmath46 and @xmath3 , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the standard deviation for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath5 respectively ; @xmath54 for x - ray ( 10 kev ) and optical ( 2.5 ev ) photons are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the standard deviation of the flux in the 2 - 10 kev band at 5 hours after the burst ( @xmath41 ) is approximately 0.58 ( kumar & piran , 1999 ) .",
    "fig 1 shows that this energy band is above @xmath19 & @xmath18 so long as @xmath55 and the density of the surrounding medium is not too small .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 for this energy band ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , from which we obtain an upper limit on @xmath50 of 0.26 and the full - with at half - maximum of the distribution for @xmath5 to be less than about 0.6 .",
    "we note that the electron energy index @xmath5 lies between 2 and 3 for supernovae remanents ( cf .",
    "chevalier 1990 , weiler et al .",
    "1986 ) , and chevalier and li ( 1999b ) point out that the range in @xmath5 for grb afterglows is at least @xmath57 2.12.5 .",
    "we can use the variation of @xmath54 with time or @xmath27 ( see figs . 2 & 3 ) to obtain @xmath50 from the observed variation to the width of @xmath41 .",
    "this is of course equivalent to the determination of @xmath5 from the slope of the light curve or the spectral slope .",
    "the currently available data , consisting of 7 bursts with known redshifts , does not provide a good constraint on the temporal variation of @xmath41 , however , hete ii and swift would increase the grb afterglow data base by more than an order of magnitude and provide much better constraint on @xmath50 .    unless @xmath4 varies by many orders of magnitude from one burst to another",
    "the last term in equation ( 9 ) is very small and can be neglected .",
    "equating the first two terms individually to @xmath58 we obtain @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ( for @xmath61 ) . for comparison ,",
    "if the first three terms in equation ( 9 ) were to contribute equally to @xmath41 then we obtain @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the mean values for @xmath3 and @xmath2 are not well determined by this procedure ( but see the discussion below ) , however @xmath65 can be accurately obtained from the observed distribution and is @xmath66 erg .",
    "so far we have discussed a nearly model independent procedure for determining @xmath50 and a linear combination of @xmath67 and @xmath68 that relies on making observations in a frequency band that lies above @xmath18 & @xmath19 . in order to determine @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "separately we need to have some knowledge of @xmath19 and @xmath18 , and therefore the result is model dependent and less certain .",
    "for instance , if the cooling and the peak synchrotron frequencies are known at some time , even if only approximately , then @xmath47 can be determined from the distribution of the observed flux at a frequency @xmath27 such that @xmath69 .",
    "the sd for @xmath70 at such an intermediate frequency is independent of @xmath31 and is given by :    @xmath71 once @xmath47 is known , equation ( 9 ) can be used to determine @xmath48 .",
    "observations at low frequencies i.e. @xmath72 , can be used to constrain @xmath49 and @xmath73 which when combined with the flux at the peak of the spectrum could be used to determine @xmath49 & @xmath73 separately with the use of the following equations ,    @xmath74    @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the isotropic luminosity at the peak of the spectrum .",
    "another approach to determining the burst and shock parameters is to compare the observed flux distributions at several different frequencies and time with the theoretically calculated distributions .",
    "the latter can be easily calculated by varying @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath5 randomly and solving for the flux using the equations given in the last section .",
    "3 shows a few cases of flux distribution functions for several different @xmath27 and @xmath0 .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that it does not require observational determination of various characteristic frequencies i.e. @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath29 , which is difficult to do unless we have good spectral and temporal coverage over many orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , this procedure can be used even without the knowledge of burst redshifts ; the redshift distribution of a representative sub - sample of bursts can be used to calculate the expected theoretical distribution of observed afterglow flux which can be directly compared with the observed flux distribution to yield the burst and shock parameters .",
    "it should be noted that if @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath29 and @xmath80 can be determined accurately then @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath9 can be obtained for individual bursts as described in eg .",
    "chevalier & li ( 1999b ) , and wijers & galama ( 1999 ) , and there is no need to resort to the statistical treatment discussed above .",
    "we have described how the distribution function for grb afterglow flux can be used to determine the width of the distribution function for the energy in the explosion and the shock parameters such as @xmath2 , @xmath4 ( the fractional energy in electrons and the magnetic field ) , @xmath5 ( the power law index for electron energy ) , and @xmath9 ( the interstellar density parameter ) .",
    "the afterglow flux at a frequency above the cooling and the synchrotron peak frequencies is independent of interstellar density and scales as @xmath81 for uniform ism as well as for energy deposited in a stellar wind with power - law density stratification . using the flux in 2 - 10 kev band for 7 bursts with known redshifts , 5 hours after the burst , which meet the above criteria , we find that the full width at half maximum of the distribution for log@xmath3 is less than 1.2 , for log@xmath2 is less than 0.9 and @xmath5 is less than 0.6 .",
    "the width for the distribution of @xmath5 is consistent with the range in @xmath5 deduced from afterglow emissions ( cf . chevalier & li , 1999b ) .",
    "the width of the distribution for @xmath5 can be more accurately determined from the time variation , or frequency dependence , of the width of the afterglow flux distribution .    for a more accurate determination of the distribution of other parameters",
    "we need to determine the cooling and the synchrotron peak frequencies ( at least approximately ) , or otherwise compare the theoretical and the observed distributions for flux at several different frequencies covering the range above and below the cooling and the synchrotron frequencies .    hete ii and swift missions are expected to significantly increase the number of grbs with observed afterglow emission and should therefore provide a more accurate determination of afterglow luminosity function and the distribution for burst energy and shock parameters .",
    "i am indebted to roger chevalier for many useful discussions and for clarifying several points .",
    "i thank alin panaitescu , tsvi piran and bohdan paczyski for numerous exciting discussions about gamma - ray bursts , and eliot quataert for comments on the paper .",
    "i thank e. waxman for sending me his recent preprint which bears some technical similarity with this work , although the results and conclusions are different ."
