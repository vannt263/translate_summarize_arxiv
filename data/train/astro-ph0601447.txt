    "in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we investigated the behavior of period - colour ( pc ) and also amplitude - colour ( ac ) relations at the @xmath3-band maximum , mean and minimum light , as the ac relations are closely related to the pc relations via the following equation , derived in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter skm ) and in paper i :",
    "@xmath5    this equation implies that if the pc relation at the maximum ( or minimum ) light is flat ( i.e. the colour is independent of period ) , then there will be an ac relation at the minimum ( or maximum ) light ( see skm , paper i and * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "thus an examination of ac relations can be used to confirm changes to the pc relation .",
    "the major assumption used in equation ( 1 ) is that temperature , not radius , fluctuations are the dominant cause of light variations , at least at the optical wavelengths @xcite . in this paper , in addition to the maximum , mean and minimum light , we extend the study of pc and ac relations at all other pulsation phases . furthermore , the extension to multi - phase relations will also expand our understanding of the pulsational behavior of classical cepheids .",
    "the results of our study justify our methods and reveal new properties of cepheids in the galaxy and magellanic clouds that can be used to constrain the theoretical cepheid pulsation / evolution models in future studies .",
    "based on the extensive data and large number of cepheids recently discovered in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , there is strong evidence that the mean light pc relation for the lmc cepheids is non - linear : there are two pc relations for the short ( @xmath6 ) and long ( @xmath1 ) period cepheids @xcite and @xmath7 , respectively . ] , respectively . in contrast , the galactic or the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) cepheids do not show any non - linearity of the mean light pc relation @xcite .",
    "therefore , our motivation is to construct and study the pc relations for galactic , lmc and smc cepheids at all phases between zero and one , because the pc relation at mean light is the average of the pc relation at all phases ( see paper i ) .",
    "thus it is important to understand the properties of the pc relation at other phases .",
    "a direct consequence of the non - linear lmc pc relation at mean light is that the lmc period - luminosity ( pl ) relation at mean light is also non - linear @xcite .",
    "although the lmc pl relation is extensively used in distance scale studies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite have discussed the implications of the non - linear mean light lmc pl and pc relations in distance scale applications .    in section 2 of this paper",
    ", we present the data and the numerical methods used in this study .",
    "the multi - phase pc relations are studied in section 3 , and the detailed comparison between the galactic and lmc pc relations is given in section 3.1 .",
    "the multi - phase ac relations are briefly presented in section 4 . since it is also of great interest to investigate the connections between the pl and pc relations for lmc cepheids , the multi - phase lmc pl relations are presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , the main conclusion of this paper is summarized in section 6 .",
    "the data used in this study are the same as in paper i for the galactic and smc cepheids , and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) for the lmc cepheids .",
    "these data include the periods , @xmath3- and @xmath4-band photometric data , and the @xmath8 values that have been published elsewhere ( see the reference in paper i & iii ) . to construct the multi - phase pc & ac relations , the light curves of the cepheids should be phased to a common starting epoch .",
    "briefly , the @xmath3- and @xmath4-band photometric data are fitted with the @xmath9-order fourier expansion of the following form @xcite :      where @xmath11 $ ] , with @xmath12 being a common starting epoch for all cepheids in both bands ( say , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the pulsation period @xmath14 ( in days ) are taken from the literature .",
    "the phases @xmath15 are in between zero and one corresponding to one full pulsation cycle .",
    "the fourier coefficients , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as well as the mean values ( @xmath18 ) for the cepheids in our samples are given in the appendix a.    to obtain the colours at various phases , the phased light curves from equation ( 2 ) should be shifted such that phase zero corresponds to ( @xmath3-band ) maximum light for all cepheids in the sample .",
    "this was done using the following steps .",
    "the phase that corresponds to maximum light - band light curve traces the luminosity curve , hence the maximum light occurs at the phase of minimum @xmath3-band light curve fitted from the fourier expansion .",
    "] , denoted as @xmath19 , can be obtained from the fitted @xmath3-band light curves .",
    "then , the light curves in _ both _ @xmath3- and @xmath4-band can be phase - shifted according to the following relations :      where @xmath21 are from equation ( 2 ) . hence , the zeroth phase of the new light curves will correspond to the ( @xmath3-band ) maximum light .",
    "since in general the cepheid light curves are skew - symmetric with slow declination from maximum to minimum , the phase of minimum light is located roughly in between phases @xmath22 and @xmath2 .",
    "the averages of the phase at minimum light , @xmath23 , for the various samples are summarized in table [ tabmin ] .    from the new light curves after the phase shift with equation ( 3 ) , the colour at @xmath24 phase for a cepheid is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the extinction corrected colour at @xmath24 phase is calculated with the subtraction of @xmath27 to @xmath25 , where @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-band amplitude for the cepheids is just @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , together with the published periods , the multi - phase pc and ac relations can be constructed by performing a standard linear regression at the particular phase @xmath30 for a given set of cepheids .       @xmath33 the entire table is available electronically at the cds .",
    "the definition of the parameters are given in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath34 and @xmath8 are adopted from the literature .",
    "zero entries mean the corresponding orders are not used in the fit ."
