    "our system of interest is a mesoscopic point contact coupling left ( @xmath0 ) and right ( @xmath1 ) reservoirs that have in general different chemical potentials @xmath2 , @xmath3 and different temperatures @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "this is an experimentally relevant situation that has been the subject of recent works  @xcite .",
    "quite generally , energy will flow from the left to the right reservoir when @xmath6 .",
    "the energy flow is accompanied by a charge flow against a difference in the chemical potentials , @xmath7 .",
    "this charge flow corresponds to the electrical work generated by the point contact .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ point contact ] shows the setup and the sign conventions .",
    "the heat extracted from the left reservoir @xmath8 has a positive sign , the ( smaller ) heat evacuated into the right reservoir @xmath9 has a negative sign .",
    "we take the generated work @xmath10 as a positive quantity : @xmath11 the efficiency of the heat engine is then defined as @xmath12    , @xmath5 and chemical potentials @xmath2 , @xmath3 may be used as a heat engine that converts heat @xmath8 partially into electrical work @xmath10 . *",

    "hence , relaxation processes in the reservoirs are assumed to be fast compared to the time @xmath15 that our measurement takes . at the end of the experiment we record the amount of heat @xmath8 that is extracted from the hot reservoir and the amount of heat @xmath9 that is dumped into the cold reservoir . due to thermal and quantum fluctuations ,",
    "the whole transfer process is probabilistic and described by a probability distribution @xmath16 .",
    "often it is more useful to use the corresponding cumulant generating function @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 .",
    "both quantities are linked by fourier transformation @xmath19 the generating function describing the statistics of heat transfer in a general two - terminal conductor is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we adapt this generating function for our purpose : @xmath20 this expression applies to a spin - degenerate single - channel point contact with transparency @xmath21 .",
    "it also contains the leads fermi occupation factors @xmath22 $ ] . for convenience",
    ", we hereafter choose units such that the planck constant , the unit charge and the boltzmann constant are equal to one .",
    "any cumulant of the distribution @xmath16 can be obtained from the generating function by taking partial derivatives @xmath23    thermoelectric effects necessarily require that the transmission probability @xmath21 of the quantum point contact depends on energy @xmath24 .",
    "a basic and convenient model for this dependence was proposed by m.  bttiker @xcite .",
    "if the potential barrier creating the point contact is a saddle , the transmission probability of one single transmission channel reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the potential at the saddle and @xmath27 gives the energy width of the transition region . in this work",
    "we will use a simplified version .",
    "we assume a very long point contact , @xmath28 , and choose the energy scale such that @xmath29 .",
    "the transmission probability then jumps sharply from zero to one @xmath30 when energy surpasses the threshold set by @xmath26 .",
    "for a given set of temperatures @xmath4 and @xmath5 we may optimize the chemical potentials @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that production of work is maximized on average .",
    "we call this optimized situation the working point of the point contact .",
    "the result is equivalent to that of the efficiency at maximum power which has been analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of scattering theory of quantum transport . from eq .",
    "we have @xmath31 with the heat extracted from the heat reservoir given by @xmath32 and the generated work obeying the joule expression @xmath33 for the nonzero voltage difference @xmath34 . combining the derivatives with respect to both chemical potentials we find @xmath35 since @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( charge current must flow against the potential from the hot to the cold reservoir )",
    ", it follows immediately that both chemical potentials have to be negative ( we set the fermi energy @xmath38 ) . substituting eq .   into @xmath39 and calculating the energy integral yields the intermediate result @xmath40 which still needs to be maximized with regard to @xmath2 .",
    "we define @xmath41 and obtain a symmetric transcendental equation and its numerical solution @xmath42 interestingly , both potentials lie below the subband energy @xmath26 and therefore the fermi functions could be approximated as boltzmann factors .",
    "this fact demonstrates that the operational principle of our device is based on a classical distribution of electrons .    for a compact representation of the results ,",
    "we introduce the numerical constants @xmath43 the mean work and extracted heat for the working point become @xmath44 with these results we are ready to calculate the mean efficiency at maximum power extraction @xmath45 in terms of the carnot efficiency @xmath46 . equation   has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite using nonlinear scattering theory .",
    "the mean efficiency reaches at most @xmath47% of the carnot efficiency .",
    "the efficiency of heat engines operated at maximum power is additionally limited by the curzon - ahlborn efficiency  @xcite , @xmath48 , which sets a stronger bound than the carnot efficiency .",
    "an expansion of eq .",
    ", @xmath49 , shows that our result falls below the curzon - ahlborn efficiency and approaches @xmath50 only near equilibrium .    for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ point contact ] we show @xmath51 ( full line ) , @xmath52 ( dashed line ) and @xmath50 ( dot - dashed line ) as a function of the temperature ratio . in the strong equilibrium case , @xmath51 reaches roughly half the carnot efficiency . we emphasize at this stage that we are considering an idealized model .",
    "the obtained efficiency serves as a reference point for the upcoming calculation .",
    "the experimentally measurable efficiency of a realistic constriction would be probably much lower , although quantum point contacts perform rather well as compared with other low - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "we have thus discussed the mean efficiency of average heat to average work conversion .",
    "however , the efficiency of a mesoscopic heat engine in general fluctuates because both work and heat fluctuate over time .",
    "therefore , efficiencies larger than the carnot limit are in principle possible  @xcite . to see this",
    ", we calculate the efficiency distribution by integrating the complete distribution @xmath16 with respect to one variable @xmath53    after representing the complete distribution by its generating function , eq .",
    "( [ generating function ] ) , the energy integration can be carried out .",
    "this step fixes one auxiliary field @xmath54 and leaves us with a single integration @xmath55 we evaluate the last integral to exponential accuracy by deforming the integration path in the complex plane and by using a saddle point approximation , i.e. , replacing the integral by its value at the saddle point @xmath56 , @xmath57\\,.\\ ] ]     of the efficiency @xmath58 on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the carnot efficiency @xmath59 can be exceeded with an exponentially small probability .",
    "* inset : * saddle point solution @xmath60 used to calculate the distributions shown in the main plot.,width=415 ]    the minimization is carried out numerically . our results for the distribution @xmath61 are shown in fig .",
    "[ efficiency distribution ] for different temperature ratios @xmath14 .",
    "the chemical potentials are taken such that the point contact is operated at its optimal working point as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_opt ] .",
    "the inset of the figure displays the saddle point solutions @xmath62 corresponding to the different distributions .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ efficiency distribution ] that the probability peaks at the mean efficiency @xmath51 . at the larger corresponding carnot efficiency",
    ", it shows a weak minimum  @xcite .",
    "this minimum is most pronounced for strong nonequilibrium ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the carnot limit is attained in the exponential tails of the distribution .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that our device beats the second law .",
    "a read - off example illustrates that the expected effect is indeed weak .",
    "let us consider a fictitious measurement lasting @xmath64  s and taking place at temperatures @xmath65  mk and @xmath66  mk ( purple dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ efficiency distribution ] ) . for these values ,",
    "the efficiency at maximum power given by eq .",
    "is @xmath67 ( the mean efficiency at this temperature ratio ) whereas the carnot efficiency is @xmath68 .",
    "now , taking into account the units of the boltzmann constant @xmath69 and planck s constant @xmath70 , the probability @xmath71 of an efficiency of 100% ( larger than the carnot value ) is found to be roughly @xmath72 times smaller than the maximal probability @xmath73 corresponding to @xmath67 .",
    "it would thus take a total measurement time of @xmath74  s to measure such a second - law violating event once .",
    "to sum up , we have considered a mesoscopic heat engine ( a quantum point contact ) coupled to hot and cold reservoirs and operating in a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "we have determined the efficiency that maximizes the work extraction in terms of the reservoir temperatures .",
    "our result is based on a transmission function that depends on energy and is valid for noninteracting electrons .",
    "m.  bttiker soon recognized that in the nonlinear regime of transport electron - electron interactions should be taken into account within a gauge - invariant current - conserving scattering theory  @xcite .",
    "when the potential landscape is self - consistently calculated , the transmision probability becomes a function of the applied temperature and voltage differences  @xcite .",
    "this effect has been neglected here , which is a valid approximation for quantum channels strongly coupled to a nearby gate  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we leave the question open as to what extend our results will be modified in the presence of nonlinearities and interactions .    furthermore , we have discussed departures of the second law of thermodynamics due to fluctuations of the efficiency that exceed the carnot limit . for a quantum point contact ,",
    "we have determined the full distribution of the efficiency and have quantified the probability that a given measurement deviates from the mean efficiency value .",
    "our results are thus relevant for a careful assessment of the heat - to - work conversion properties of quantum coherent heat engines .",
