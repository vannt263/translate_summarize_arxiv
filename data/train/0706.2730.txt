    "this counter experiment is missing in the case of sn isotopes .",
    "it is known that the sd strength has almost the same amount of contributions to neutrino reactions as that of the gamow - teller strength @xcite .",
    "the pb target is considered to be the most promising candidate for detecting the heavy - flavor neutrinos from the supernovae .",
    "thus , it is quite important to study the sd strength in the pb target for a precise evaluation of the cross - sections of charge - induced neutrino reactions .    in this paper",
    ", we study the sd excitations and the neutron skin thickness by using the hf and hf+ random phase approximation ( rpa ) with skyrme interactions . as a theoretical model ,",
    "the hf+rpa model has been extensively applied to giant resonances in a broad region of mass table@xcite .",
    "the same model was used for the study of spin - dependent charge exchange excitations@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the model successfully predicts gt and sd states in @xmath5sc and @xmath0nb@xcite .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",

    "we adopt four skyrme interactions , namely , siii , sgii , ski3 and sly4 , for the hf+rpa calculations .",
    "the landau parameters and nuclear matter properties of these interactions are shown in table [ tab : landau ] .",
    "for the spin - isospin excitations , the value @xmath15 plays the important role of determining the collective properties of the excitation @xcite .",
    "the rpa equation is solved using the basis expanded by the harmonic oscillator wave functions up to the maximum major quantum number of @xmath16 = 10 for @xmath0zr and @xmath16=12 for @xmath1pb .",
    "the hf calculations are performed without the spin - gradient terms ( j@xmath17 terms ) since the adopted skyrme interactions have been fitted without them @xcite , but the rpa calculations incorporate the spin - gradient terms . the two - body spin - orbit and two - body coulomb interactions are neglected in the rpa calculations .",
    "we also performed the continuum hf+rpa calculations with one of the interactions and found essentially the same strength distributions as in the present calculations except the width due to the coupling to the continuum @xcite .",

    "so far , the charge exchange gamow - teller(gt ) states in @xmath1bi were studied by taking into account the couplings to 2p-2h states in the particle - vibration model @xcite .",
    "while a large spread was found in the gt states in the particle - vibration model calculations , the peak energy did not change appreciably due to the couplings to 2p-2h states .",
    "there have been no microscopic studies of sd states that take into account the couplings to 2p-2h states in a=208 nuclei .",
    "sum rules are useful tools to study the collective nature of excitation modes in many - body systems . in particular , for charge exchange excitations , model - independent sum rules are derived and used to analyze experimental data on gamow - teller resonances and sd resonances @xcite . for sd states , the sum rules can be used to extract the neutron skin thickness , as was discussed in section 2 .",

    "the neutron skin thickness @xmath41 fm extracted from the sd sum rules is close to the calculated values obtained using sly4 as well as siii and sgii .",

    "this is indicative of the soft neutron matter eos induced by the strong linear correlation between the neutron matter eos and the neutron skin thickness .",
    "we showed that the sd strength of the @xmath6 excitation of @xmath1pb has a large width due to the landau damping effect .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath7 excitation of @xmath1pb turns out to be a single peak in a rather low energy region because of the strong pauli blocking effect of the excess neutrons .",

    "this peak energy coincides with the peak calculated using the sgii interaction , while the ski3 interaction yields a peak that is a few mev higher than the empirical peak .",
