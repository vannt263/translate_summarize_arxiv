    "many - body mixture of bosons and fermions is an interesting quantum system .",
    "it is not only useful to study the interplay between different quantum statistics in condensed matter physics and in atomic physics @xcite , but also important for understanding the hadron - quark phase transition in nuclear and particle physics @xcite .",
    "recently , many kinds of bose - fermi mixtures have been realized in ultracold atomic experiments . in particular ,",
    "the bose - fermi mixtures such as @xmath0rb-@xmath1k @xcite , @xmath2yb-@xmath3yb and @xmath4yb-@xmath3yb @xcite can be trapped in three - dimensional optical lattices .    despite of its importance , ab initio quantum monte carlo calculations of the bose - fermi hubbard model , which is a model system of the bose - fermi mixture on the optical lattice ,",
    "have been limited to one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "( see also a recent review @xcite . )",
    "these simulations were done with improved versions of the world - line formalism @xcite .",
    "the world - line formalism is an exact scheme in one spatial dimension while it has the fermion sign problem in higher dimensions . in this paper , we apply the method of lattice monte carlo simulation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite to overcome the fermion sign problem in the bose - fermi mixture of ultracold atoms on an optical lattice in three spatial dimensions at finite temperature .",
    "the lattice qcd simulation is an established numerical framework for the strongly coupled regime of qcd ; the mixture of gluons ( bosons ) and quarks ( fermions ) can be treated in any dimension without fermion sign problem as long as the fermion determinant is real and semi - positive .",
    "( for relativistic fermions with finite chemical potential , the fermion determinant becomes complex , while the chemical potential for non - relativistic fermions does not cause the problem . ) this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model action and discuss the basic setup of our simulations . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the bosonic superfluid transition and its dependence on the strength of the boson - fermion coupling .",
    "the particle densities and the pair occupancies are also studied to understand the effect of the boson - fermion coupling . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize this study . a part of the preliminary results was reported in ref .",
    "we consider one - component boson field @xmath5 and two - component fermion field @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the partition function @xmath8 is then written as a path integral in terms of the euclidean action @xmath9 : @xmath10 in the second line , the bilinear form of the fermion fields are integrated out , so that @xmath8 becomes a functional only of the boson field .",
    "we adopt the single - band bose - fermi hubbard model whose lattice action reads @xcite @xmath11    @xmath12 \\\\ \\label{eq : sf } s_f & = & \\sum_{\\vec{x},\\tau,\\sigma } \\big [ \\psi_\\sigma^*(\\vec{x},\\tau ) \\ { \\psi_\\sigma(\\vec{x},\\tau ) - e^{\\mu_f } \\psi_\\sigma(\\vec{x},\\tau-1 ) \\ } -   \\sum_{j=1}^3 t_f \\ { \\psi_\\sigma^*(\\vec{x},\\tau )",

    "we do not consider the fermion - fermion interaction for simplicity , i.e. @xmath19 . the temporal hopping structures of the chemical potential and the interaction are based on refs .",
    "@xcite .    note that we have absorbed the spatial lattice spacing @xmath20 and the temporal lattice spacing @xmath21 into the definition of the fields and the coupling parameters . here",
    "@xmath20 should be identified with a finite lattice constant of an optical lattice , while @xmath21 should be eventually taken to be zero to recover the continuum limit in the temporal direction . in the following discussion ,",
    "all dimensional quantities are scaled by the lattice constant .",
    "our lattice action has the boson sign problem which appears in non - relativistic systems .",
    "the boson action is complex in general because the temporal hopping term is given as @xmath22 with the boson matsubara frequency @xmath23 . to avoid this boson sign problem",
    ", we adopted the zero - frequency approximation , in which the boson field is projected onto the zero - frequency mode as @xmath24 .",
    "this approximation is validated if the system is either in the critical region or in the high - temperature limit , where the static mode of the boson field , @xmath25 , gives a dominant contribution .",
    "furthermore , effect of the non - zero matsubara modes can be estimated by using the reweighting method @xcite .",
    "we can prove that the fermion determinant is real and positive .",
    "let us consider the fermion action in the frequency space .",
    "the matrix @xmath26 becomes diagonal in the frequency space .",
    "the complex factor is only @xmath27 with the fermion matsubara frequency @xmath28 .",
    "the fermion determinant is @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\ & > & 0 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are real numbers .",
    "therefore , there arises no sign problem originating from the fermion determinant .",
    "( this is in contrast to the bose - fermi system with a yukawa coupling discussed e.g. in ref .",
    "even if the fermion - fermion interaction is introduced , there is no fermion sign problem : after the hubbard - stratonovich transformation of the fermion - fermion interaction , @xmath26 is still a real matrix with auxiliary fields , so that the two - component fermion determinant becomes semi - positive , @xmath32 .",
    "our numerical simulation procedure is based on the hybrid monte carlo algorithm with the pseudofermions @xcite , which is widely used in modern simulations of lattice field theories . for preconditioning the fermion matrix",
    ", we perform a fourier transformation from the imaginary time @xmath33 to the fermion matsubara frequency @xmath34 . in this study",
    ", we fixed the hopping parameters @xmath35 and the repulsive boson - boson interaction @xmath36 for the first trial .",
    "we performed the simulation in a spatial lattice volume @xmath37 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we varied temperature @xmath38 by changing the temporal lattice size as @xmath39 , 30 , 40 , 60 , and 100 .    in the grand - canonical approach ,",
    "particle number densities are related to chemical potentials and other parameters .",
    "therefore , we monitor the boson number density @xmath40 and fermion number density @xmath41 in our simulations : @xmath42 note that , in the mean - field level , the boson - fermion coupling @xmath18 induces effective chemical potentials : @xmath43 this implies that attractive boson - fermion interaction ( @xmath44 ) increases the effective chemical potentials and hence the particle number densities .",
    "our numerical simulations given below indeed show such behavior .",

    "although the statistical errors are shown by the error - bars in the figure , they are smaller than the size of the symbols and practically invisible . at high temperature ( @xmath52 )",
    ", @xmath50 drops to zero exponentially , while at low temperature ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath50 approaches to a constant value for large @xmath54 , i.e. a signature of the the off - diagonal long - range order .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we draw the boson condensate fraction defined by @xmath55 for different values of @xmath46 and @xmath18 at @xmath47 .",
    "the blue region corresponds to the superfluid phase .",
    "the figure shows that the superfluid region is enlarged as the boson - fermion attraction ( @xmath56 ) becomes strong .",
    "this is because @xmath57 and hence the boson number density @xmath40 increase associated with the increase of the boson - fermion attraction .",
    "the particle number densities and pair occupancies at @xmath58 and @xmath59 as a function of @xmath18 . ]    to see the effect of @xmath18 on particle number profiles in more details , let us introduce normalized pair occupancies which is a measure to find a pair at the same lattice site ; @xmath60 here the number density operators are defined as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the coefficient 1/2 in @xmath63 is a symmetry factor for identical particles .",
    "the pair occupancies are experimentally observed on a three - dimensional optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the particle profiles as a function of @xmath14 for repulsive boson - fermion interaction @xmath64 .",
    "other parameters are the same with fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we show the particle number densities ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and the pair occupancies ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath63 ) as a function of @xmath18 . the chemical potentials are fixed at @xmath67 as in the previous figures , while the temperature is chosen to be @xmath59 ( upper boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "as the boson - fermion attraction becomes stronger , both @xmath40 and @xmath41 increase , which is consistent with the behavior expected from the effective chemical potentials as we have already mentioned .",
    "also , the pair occupancy of different ( same ) species tends to be enhanced ( suppressed ) as @xmath18 increases , which is naturally expected from the contact nature of the boson - fermion interaction . note that @xmath63 is always below unity , since we have taken repulsive boson - boson interaction .    in figs .",

    "[ fig3 ] . by varying @xmath14 in the interval [ @xmath69 , the fermion number density @xmath41",
    "is changed from zero ( i.e. complete vacancy ) to unity ( i.e. full occupancy ) .",
    "the boson number density @xmath40 is an increasing ( decreasing ) function of @xmath14 in the attractive ( repulsive ) case , which is consistent with the behavior expected from the effective chemical potential @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mubeff ] ) .",
    "also , the boson - fermion pair occupancy @xmath65 is reduced ( enhanced ) from unity in the repulsive ( attractive ) case as naturally expected from the contact nature of the boson - fermion interaction .",
    "the fermion number density approaches to unity , when @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mufeff ] ) becomes large either by large attractive boson - fermion interaction or by large fermion chemical potential .",
    "if fermions fully occupy all the lattice sites , both @xmath65 and @xmath66 become unity , since the numerators of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dbf ] ) and ( [ eq : dff ] ) factorize .",
    "although the bare fermion - fermion interaction is switched off in our present simulations ( @xmath19 ) , there arises induced fermion - fermion attraction due to the coupling of the fermions to the boson density fluctuation with the magnitude of @xmath71 ) @xcite .",
    "because of this , the fermion pair occupancy @xmath66 is enhanced irrespective of the sign of @xmath18 as seen in figs .  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . also , the boson pair occupancy @xmath63 changes slightly because the boson number density @xmath40 changes .",
    "the boson pair occupancy @xmath63 approaches to unity as the boson becomes dilute .",
    "in summary , we have performed a quantum monte carlo simulation of bose - fermi mixture at finite temperature on the three - dimensional optical lattice . the sign problem from the boson hopping term is avoided by taking only the lowest matsubara mode , which is valid near the critical point or at high temperature .",
    "we have analyzed the off - diagonal long - range order of the boson , the particle number densities , and pair occupancies for attractive and repulsive boson - fermion interaction .",
    "we found that the region of the bose - einstein condensation is extended as the boson - fermion attraction becomes strong .",
    "the particle number profiles obtained from the simulations can be understood in terms of the effective chemical potentials and induced fermion - fermion interaction driven by the boson - fermion interaction .",
    "the present exploratory study is a starting point of more expanded simulations with the ingredients including ( i ) the bare fermion - fermion interaction , ( ii ) finite size scaling analysis with several different lattice volumes , ( iii ) continuum limit in the temporal direction , ( iv ) taking into account the non - zero matsubara mode for bosons , and ( v ) mapping of the phase diagram to the fixed number of bosons and fermions . from the physics point of view , there are various interesting future problems to be examined with our approach , e.g. the superfluidity of fermion pairs induced by the density fluctuation of the background bosons with the boson - fermion coupling , and the properties of the boson - fermion mixture in the strongly coupled regime .",
