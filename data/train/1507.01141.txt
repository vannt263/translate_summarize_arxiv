    "this paper presents new results on the stability of the inversion of the hilbert transform with limited data .",
    "the main application concerns tomographic reconstruction from truncated projections , where some 2d and 3d problems can be reduced to the inversion of the hilbert transform on a family of line segments defined by the geometry of the scanners . the reduction of the 2d or 3d tomography problem to a 1d hilbert transform inversion problem is achieved by backprojecting a derivative of the projection data over an angular range of 180 degrees .",
    "this operation based on a result by gelfand and graev @xcite is referred to as the _ differentiated backprojection _ ( dbp ) . in the 2000 s ,",
    "the dbp triggered a remarkable evolution in tomography by allowing accurate reconstruction of regions of interest ( roi ) from truncated projection data sets @xcite , which were previously believed to exclude any accurate reconstruction .",
    "a second method for accurate roi reconstruction from limited data , the _ virtual fan - beam algorithm _ ( vfb ) , was introduced in 2002 ; it is based on a different mathematical property of the radon transform and will not be studied in this paper .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a review on roi reconstruction in tomography and the link between that problem and the hilbert transform .",
    "we work with a line integral model of the tomographic data , assuming continuous ( infinitely fine ) sampling of the 2d or 3d x - ray transform of the unknown function @xmath7 within some subset of the space of lines in @xmath8 or @xmath9 . in this context",
    "`` accurate '' reconstruction means that the data uniquely and stably determine @xmath7 within a roi , under appropriate assumptions .",
    "these assumptions specify the functional spaces to which the object and the data belong , the nature and magnitude of the measurement noise , and typically also involve prior constraints on the object . loosely speaking we call a reconstruction `` stable '' with _ hlder continuity _ if the norm of the error on the estimated @xmath7 ( possibly within some limited roi ) can be bounded by some positive power of the norm of the measurement error @xcite .",
    "in contrast one speaks of _ logarithmic continuity _ when the error bound decreases only with the logarithm of the noise .",
    "the noise propagation properties of the dbp are well understood , since they are similar to those of the usual filtered - backprojection ( fbp ) algorithm . this can be seen by observing that the two procedures involve the same backprojection , and that the ramp filter @xmath10 ( for fbp ) and the derivative filter @xmath11 ( for dbp ) similarly amplify high frequencies .",
    "thus , the major question left is to analyze the stability of the inversion of the hilbert transform with limited data .",
    "the rest of this paper focuses on that one - dimensional inverse problem .    to date",
    ", much more is known on conditions guaranteeing uniqueness of the solution than on the stability in the presence of noise .",
    "stability is easy to analyze when a closed form analytic inversion formula is known , such as the fbp algorithm for the radon transform with complete data . with the dbp",
    "however , a closed form inversion exists only when the limited data allow calculating the hilbert transform of @xmath7 on a line segment @xmath2 that contains the support @xmath3 of @xmath7 along that line . in this case ,",
    "inversion is based on the finite inverse hilbert transform and has very good stability ( all singular values but one are equal to @xmath12 in a weighted @xmath6 space @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately no closed form inversion is known for the two other configurations : the _ interior problem _ ( @xmath13 and the _ truncated problem _ where @xmath2 partially overlaps @xmath3 .    it has long been known @xcite that unique inversion is not possible for the interior problem , even within the roi @xmath2 where the data are known .",
    "however , uniqueness holds when additional information is available .",
    "one such instance is the case where @xmath7 is known in some segment @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "other results show that uniqueness is restored when @xmath7 is assumed to belong to some function space ( e.g. @xmath7 is piecewise constant , a polynomial function or a generalized spline ) @xcite .",
    "numerical tests with discretized models of these problems suggest good stability but these results may depend on the way the problem is discretized . to our knowledge",
    "explicit stability estimates have only been obtained when @xmath7 is a polynomial function in the interior region @xcite .    for the _ truncated problem _ uniqueness of the solution follows from simple analyticity arguments @xcite .",
    "however , the stability bound obtained in @xcite is difficult to interpret since it relates the reconstruction error to an upper bound on the error on an intermediate function and not to the error on the hilbert transform .",
    "also , the results in @xcite do not pertain to a specific regularization method .",
    "recently , a more explicit stability estimate has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "it guarantees logarithmic continuity for the reconstruction on the entire support @xmath3 of @xmath7 if prior knowledge on the total variation of @xmath4 is assumed .",
    "this paper exploits recent results on the asymptotics of the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the truncated hilbert transform with overlap @xcite . with these",
    ", explicit @xmath6 stability estimates are obtained .",
    "they allow to guarantee stable inversion of the corresponding inverse problem when an a priori bound on the @xmath6 norm of the solution is assumed .",
    "we give specific examples for the truncated svd and for tikhonov s method . by seeking to reconstruct only within a _ region of interest _",
    ", hlder continuity is obtained .",
    "a similar result is shown for prior knowledge on the total variation of @xmath7 .    * remark . *",
    "stability estimates allow assessing the ill - posedness of an inverse problem independently of the algorithm and independently of the discrete sampling of the data and solution .",
    "the inversion of the truncated hilbert transform is a very specific problem , which is severely or mildly ill - posed depending on which region of interest is reconstructed .",
    "the stability estimates in this paper are derived in a deterministic framework , they give worst case error bounds , which are pessimistic and for that reason do not provide reliable absolute values for the regularization parameter .",
    "however , our results for the hilbert transform determine the hlder power of the reconstruction accuracy in terms of known constants depending on the geometry of the problem ( i.e. on the intervals @xmath1 and @xmath15 ) . this may provide guidance to adapt the regularization parameter to varying geometry or data error , once it has been empirically estimated for one case .",
    "future work will investigate application to image reconstruction from incomplete ct data .",
    "consider the truncated hilbert transform @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 : @xmath20 we define the normalized singular function pair @xmath21 , @xmath22 such that @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "the singular values @xmath25 are ordered as usual by decreasing values , and the spectrum has two accumulation points , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we will make use of the following properties of the singular system of @xmath28 :    * for large @xmath29 the asymptotic behavior of the singular values is given by @xmath30 for some small @xmath31 and with @xmath32 here , @xmath33 . * for large negative @xmath34",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the singular values is @xmath35 * the singular function @xmath36 is bounded at @xmath37 and @xmath38 and has a logarithmic singularity at @xmath39 . for large @xmath40",
    "it is an oscillatory function in the interval @xmath41 and a monotonically decreasing function on @xmath42 . *",
    "the function @xmath43 is bounded at @xmath39 and @xmath44 and has a logarithmic singularity at @xmath38 . for large @xmath40",
    "it is a monotonically increasing function in the interval @xmath42 and an oscillatory function on @xmath45 . * for sufficiently small @xmath46 , the norm of @xmath43 over the segment @xmath47 has the following asymptotic behavior @xmath48 where @xmath49    except for the last property which is proven in the appendix ( see lemma [ lemma1 ] )",
    ", the proofs of all the above properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , the monotonicity of the singular functions @xmath43 is shown more explicitly in the appendix ( see lemma [ lemma2 ] ) .",
    "we consider the following inverse problem .",
    "let @xmath50 be an object of interest and let @xmath51 be the corresponding noise - free data , with @xmath28 the truncated hilbert transform ( [ ht ] ) .",
    "given a noisy measurement @xmath52 such that @xmath53 for some noise level @xmath54 , we seek an estimate of @xmath55 on some interval @xmath47 , with some small @xmath46 .",
    "the rationale to restrict the reconstruction to a limited interval is that there is no hope of obtaining a hlder stability estimate outside the segment @xmath56 where the hilbert transform is known .",
    "following a similar intuitive analysis by natterer @xcite for the exterior problem of tomography , this can be seen by considering an object @xmath55 which is supported in @xmath45 and has a discontinuity somewhere in that interval .",
    "for such an object , one sees from ( [ ht ] ) that @xmath57 is @xmath58 and therefore an inverse operator should map a @xmath58 function onto a discontinuous function , which corresponds to a severely ill - posed problem .",
    "this severe ill - posedness is also expected from the exponential decay of the singular values , equation ( [ sigmaasympt ] ) . thus , unless very restrictive prior knowledge is assumed the quest for a stable reconstruction must be restricted to an interval such as @xmath47 . by varying the parameter @xmath59 one can study the degradation of the stability as one gets closer to the limit of the stably recoverable region @xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath60 the characteristic function of that `` region - of - interest '' interval @xmath47 .",
    "we assume the following properties of the svd :    * p1 : @xmath61 .",
    "* p2 : there are some @xmath62 and positive real @xmath63 such that @xmath64 for @xmath65 . *",
    "p3 : there are some @xmath66 and positive real @xmath67 such that @xmath68 for @xmath69 .    the constants @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be obtained from ( [ sigmaasympt ] ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 corresponds to the leading term of the asymptotic behavior of the singular values .",
    "hence , any value of @xmath70 smaller than @xmath74 provides an upper bound for sufficiently large @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the index @xmath75 and the constants @xmath76 all depend on the choice of @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , for p3 to hold , @xmath77 ; so the smaller @xmath59 is chosen to be , the larger @xmath75 has to be taken . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath78 to be arbitrarily small but fixed .",
    "the results obtained in the following sections are no longer valid as @xmath79 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath80 only decays as @xmath81 ( see equation ( 8.6 ) in @xcite ) . in what follows",
    ", we select @xmath75 such that @xmath82 , so that p2 holds for all @xmath83 .",
    "property p3 follows from equation ( [ asymptfn2 ] ) , this asymptotic relation can be changed into an upper bound by taking for instance @xmath84      we assume as regularizing prior knowledge on the solution an upper bound @xmath85 on the norm of the object , @xmath86 .",
    "the stability bound that we present follows the approach of miller @xcite .",
    "this formulation is independent of a specific algorithm , but instead yields an upper bound on the @xmath6 distance ( within the interval @xmath47 ) between any pair of solutions that are compatible both with the data and with the prior knowledge .",
    "we define the set of _ admissible solutions _ as @xmath87    [ prop1 ] let @xmath88 and assume @xmath89 .",
    "we consider the reconstruction of @xmath55 from a noisy measurement @xmath52 for which @xmath53 is given .",
    "then , any algorithm that for given @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath52 computes a solution in @xmath92 , is a regularization method for the reconstruction on @xmath47 .",
    "more precisely , given any two admissible solutions @xmath93 , one has for sufficiently small @xmath90 the bound @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a constant , which only depends on @xmath71 and @xmath96 .",

    "the corresponding hilbert transforms @xmath98 and @xmath99 satisfy @xmath100 . similarly @xmath101 .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath102 using the svd of @xmath28 and splitting the obtained expansion into three terms as follows : @xmath103 here , the svd series is split at @xmath75 and at some  so far arbitrary ",

    "the error due to the large singular values is bounded as @xmath110    the contribution of the intermediate terms corresponding to @xmath111 to the error is bounded as @xmath112 where we successively used the triangle inequality , schwarz inequality , and majorized by extending the sum over @xmath113 to all @xmath114 .",

    "an intuitive interpretation of the stability estimate ( [ boundf1f2 ] ) is that the number of significant digits that can be reliably recovered when estimating the solution is roughly equal to a fraction @xmath130 of the number of significant digits in the measured data . *",
    "the first sum in ( [ f1mf2 ] ) starts at @xmath131 because the spectrum of @xmath28 has two accumulation points .",

    "this holds only for the continuous - continuous model of the inverse problem , which is analyzed in this paper . in practice ,",
