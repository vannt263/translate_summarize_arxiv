    "although lattice field theories allow for a completely non - perturbative definition of a quantum field theory , computational limitations impose severe restrictions on our ability to perform calculations in them . at the beginning of the new millennium many important questions that arise in a variety of fields like strongly interacting fermionic systems , frustrated systems , systems with @xmath0-vacuum , chiral gauge theories and real time dynamics in quantum field theories , remain unanswered .",
    "a common problem that hinders progress in all these areas is the `` sign problem '' , which arises due to the inability to isolate the appropriate probabilistic measure for a stochastic computation .",
    "one is typically interested in the partition function of a quantum many body system which can be compactly written as @xmath1 \\;=\\ ; \\sum_{[c ] } w[c]\\ ] ] where the sum over configurations @xmath2 is used to evaluate the trace through the feynman path integral in a convenient basis .",
    "in general @xmath3 $ ] , the boltzmann weight of the configuration , is not guaranteed to be positive definite .",
    "the difficulty in finding the right class of configurations such that @xmath4 is positive definite is referred to as the sign problem . however , since @xmath5 itself is positive definite a summation over a sufficiently large number of configurations should always yield a positive answer .",
    "unfortunately , the number of configurations required grows exponentially with the volume ; it is hopeless to require even a computer to perform the re - summation .",
    "recently , a lot of progress has been made in solving sign problems using cluster methods since it is sometimes possible to analytically sum over all the configurations that are obtained through cluster flips .",
    "furthermore , this class of configurations can grow exponentially with volume .",
    "interestingly , every known type of cluster algorithm has been applied to solve to a new type of sign problem .",
    "the first solution was found in a classical @xmath6 model with a @xmath0 parameter which makes the action complex @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a summation over flips of wolff clusters @xcite produced only positive ( or zero ) weights .",
    "more recently , it was discovered that in certain four - fermi models a similar result emerges when one uses loop clusters known from quantum spin systems @xcite .",
    "this has been used to eliminate sign problems that arise due to fermi statistics @xcite .",
    "sign problems in potts models due to a complex action can be solved using clusters of the swendsen - wang algorithm@xcite .    in this article",
    "the above progress is reviewed using the example of the potts model which relevant to qcd at a finite density of static quarks .",
    "the next section contains a review of the sign problem in qcd with a new perspective on its `` physical origin '' .",
    "it is argued that the sign problem has two parts , one coming from gauss law type constraints and the other from fermion permutations .",
    "the later sections show that the recent progress has produced examples in which both types of sign problems can be solved separately . in simple cases it may be possible to find solutions to the combined problem in the near future .",
    "the partition function in qcd is usually written as a path integral over fermionic and gauge fields .",
    "instead of representing fermions as grassmann variables , for computational reasons they are integrated out in favor of a fermion determinant .",
    "the final result takes the form @xmath7\\;\\exp\\left(-s_g[u]\\right ) \\;{\\rm det}(d[u ] ) \\label{zqcd}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the dirac operator .",
    "given that the gauge field action @xmath9 $ ] is real the usual claim is that sign problems arise from the fermion determinant .",
    "as is well known in the presence of a chemical potential the fermion determinant @xmath10)$ ] becomes complex .",
    "although this description is quite accurate , it is a bit unsatisfactory since a lot of interesting dynamics of quarks has been pushed into the calculation of the fermion determinant .",
    "exposing the anatomy of the fermion determinant may reveal some deeper `` physical origin '' to the sign problem .",
    "this can be illustrated by a simple example .",
    "consider compact qed instead of qcd .",
    "the partition function in that case is similar to ( [ zqcd ] ) except that the integration is over @xmath11 gauge fields instead of @xmath12 . again adding a chemical potential makes the fermion determinant complex and",
    "hence introduces a sign problem for the same reasons as in qcd .",
    "but in this case it is possible to understand the origin of the sign problem at a more deeper level .",
    "if the fermion determinant is expanded as a sum over electron and positron world line configurations , the configurations that dominate at non - zero chemical potentials would contain more electrons than positrons . however , due to gauss s law it is impossible to have more electrons than positrons in a periodic box .",
    "hence , the weight of such configurations must be zero once gauss s law is imposed .",
    "since it is the integral over the gauge fields that enforces gauss s law , it is natural to have both positive and negative contributions in the path integral for a fixed gauge field configuration .",
    "the negative signs can help cancel the wrong configurations .",
    "understanding the `` physical '' origin of the sign problem makes the solution clear . in the case of qed",
    ", one must throw away all fermionic configurations in which there are more electrons than positrons .",
    "this effectively means the chemical potential has no effect on the partition function which is a well known fact @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , fermionic world line configurations have sign problems of their own that arise from the pauli principle .",
    "when fermions travel in imaginary time their positions can get permuted .",
    "whenever this permutation is odd the configuration weight is negative .",
    "thus , performing the integration over the gauge field configurations alone in general will not yield a positive weight for a fermionic configuration .",
    "in fact the sign problem in qcd arises due to an intricate mixture of fermion permutation sign and a more difficult constraints one of which is the gauss s law .",
    "the example from qed suggests that it may be useful to consider a regrouping of both fermion and gauge field configurations in the search to find positive definite weights .",
    "there are special limits where the sign problem becomes much simpler .",
    "one is the limit of static quarks . here",
    "the fermions can not permute with each other and so problems arise only from gauss s law type constraints .",
    "this simplification has prompted a variety of research on the physics of qcd with a finite density of static quarks .",
    "however , adding chemical potential to quarks that are infinitely massive is a bit subtle . in order to induce a finite density of static quarks one needs to take the chemical potential to infinity along with the quark mass always keeping the chemical potential larger than the rest mass of the quarks .",
    "this limit was originally formulated in @xcite and later studied in @xcite .",
    "more recently the partition function for a fixed baryon number in the static quark limit was studied in @xcite .",
    "an equivalent but simpler approach to the limit of static quarks can be formulated by recognizing that the partition function for @xmath13 quarks and @xmath14 antiquarks of mass @xmath15 in the static limit is given by @xmath16\\ ; \\frac{\\phi^n}{n!}\\;\\frac{{\\phi^*}^{\\bar{n}}}{\\bar{n}!}\\ ; { \\rm e}^{-s_g[u ] - m(n+\\bar{n})n_t}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 $ ] is the gauge action on a @xmath17 lattice .",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath18 is implicit in the definition of @xmath19 .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is the sum over the trace of polyakov lines at every spatial point @xmath21 , @xmath22 with @xmath23 representing the time like links .",
    "the grand canonical partition function is then given by @xmath24\\ ; { \\rm e}^{-s_g[u ] + h\\;\\phi + h^\\prime\\;\\phi^ * } \\label{zsqcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the static quark limit is obtained by taking the @xmath27 and @xmath28 limits with @xmath25 fixed . in this limit @xmath29 . note that although the above approach treats quarks as bosons instead of fermions , at finite densities in the continuum limit it is impossible to distinguish between them .    due to the complex nature of @xmath30 the partition function of eq .",
    "( [ zsqcd ] ) suffers from a sign problem albeit a much simpler one as compared to eq .",
    "( [ zqcd ] ) . absorbing the magnitude of this term in the boltzmann weight",
    ", one can define the average of the phase as , @xmath31\\;{\\rm e}^{-s_g[u ] + h{\\rm re}\\phi}\\ ; { \\rm e}^{ih{\\rm im}\\phi } } { \\int\\;[du]\\;{\\rm e}^{-s_g[u ] + h{\\rm re}\\phi}}.\\ ] ] since @xmath32 is a ratio of two partition functions , in the large volume limit it will vanish exponentially . in order to make progress without solving the sign problem",
    "it is necessary to remain in volumes where the average sign is not too small .",
    "this usually puts severe restrictions on our ability to address interesting questions regarding the phase transition .",
    "-0.3 in   is expected to be in the universality class of the 3-d ising model.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    -0.7 in    the phase diagram in the @xmath33 plane was first studied in @xcite .",
    "figure [ pdiag ] shows the most likely scenario based on the well known fact that there is a first order transition on the @xmath34 line at @xmath35 due to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath36 center symmetry . when @xmath37 the symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "however , the first order phase transition should typically persist for non - zero @xmath38 with decreasing latent heat ending at the second order critical point @xmath2 which should be governed by the 3-d ising universality class .",
    "although , the study in @xcite could not confirm this picture it showed that the point @xmath2 must be quite close to the @xmath34 axis .",
    "in particular the well known discontinuity in the polyakov line at @xmath35 disappeared at the smallest @xmath38 studied .",
    "this information suggests that with out solving the sign problem it may still be possible to study the behavior of the model close to the critical line of the phase diagram on lattices whose size is constrained by the closeness of the point @xmath2 to the @xmath34 axis .",
    "an interesting challenge is to be able to solve the sign problem arising in eq .",
    "( [ zsqcd ] ) . such a solution can perhaps teach us about solutions to other more interesting sign problems in gauge theories . in order to make progress it is useful to learn from a simpler example where the gauge dynamics is replaced with a simple 3-state potts model .",

    "an interesting solution to the sign problem in ( [ zpotts ] ) was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the partition function can be rewritten in terms of new variables which describe classical statistical mechanics arising from the hamiltonian , @xmath42 that represents the energy of configurations labeled by quark number distribution @xmath43 associated with sites and color flux variables @xmath44 associated with links .",
    "the configurations further obey the gauss s law constraint @xmath45 this type of flux tube models is well known in the literature @xcite .",
    "since the hamiltonian is real , except for the complications arising from the gauss law constraint , the sign problem is completely solved .",
    "the introduction of new variables has helped in re - summing over classes of configurations in the original variables . in @xcite",
    "a metropolis algorithm was used to study the flux tube model .",
    "there is another way to solve the sign problem arising in ( [ zpotts ] ) based on cluster algorithms for potts models @xcite .",

    "the difficulties associated with finite density qcd are shared by much simpler four - fermi models like the repulsive hubbard model away from half filling . the conventional approach in interacting fermion models is to rewrite the interactions as fermion bilinears using auxiliary fields so that the fermions can be integrated out in favor of a fermion determinant , very much like in qcd .",
