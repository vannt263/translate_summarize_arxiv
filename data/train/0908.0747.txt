    "topological properties , by definition , are invariant under a continuous deformation of parameters until a phase boundary is encountered .",
    "it is believed that two fractional quantum hall states that are adiabatically connected , that is , are related by a deformation of the hamiltonian during which the gap does not close , have identical topological properties . to the extent",
    "the character of the excitations is determined by the topology of the state , this implies that the excitations also evolves adiabatically .",
    "however , there is no reason why the excitations can not change their character in a fundamental manner through level crossings and gap openings in the excitation spectrum even as the ground state evolves adiabatically .",
    "such examples indeed exist in other contexts : for bardeen - cooper - schrieffer to bose - einstein condensate crossover of a superconductor , the low - energy excitations are fermionic quasiparticles in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer limit but bosonic collective modes in the bose - einstein condensate limit .",
    "some examples of such phase transitions in the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite ( fqhe ) are given at the end of this article .",
    "this paper concerns a model in which the gap does not close during a variation in the interaction but the nature of the quasiholes changes in a qualitative manner .",
    "the fqhe in the lowest landau level is explained by the composite fermion ( cf ) theory.@xcite although not widely appreciated , the topological character of the fqhe is encoded in the very formation of composite fermions , which are topological particles by virtue of having quantized vortices as one of their constituents .",
    "the topology of composite fermions reveals itself most directly through an effective magnetic field @xmath1 for composite fermions , as well as their @xmath2 levels ( @xmath2 levels are the kinetic energy levels of composite fermions , analogous to the landau levels of electrons in the effective magnetic field ) , which are directly responsible for most of the fqhe phenomenology ( here , @xmath3 is called the flux quantum , @xmath4 is the particle density , and @xmath5 is the number of vortices bound to electrons ) .",
    "the prominent sequences of fractions at @xmath6 are explained as the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) of composite fermions , and the @xmath7 state as the fermi sea of composite fermions@xcite in @xmath8 .",
    "( the electron filling factor is defined as @xmath9 . )",
    "the effective magnetic field @xmath10 has also been measured in several geometric experiments.@xcite theoretically , the effective magnetic field and @xmath2 levels have been confirmed by verifying that ( i ) the low - lying energy levels of the interacting electron system at an _ arbitrary _ @xmath11 have a one - to - one correspondence with the low - lying energy levels of noninteracting fermions at @xmath10 , and ( ii ) the wave functions of interacting electrons at @xmath11 are closely related to noninteracting fermions at @xmath10 ( through composite fermionization ) .",
    "of relevance to this article are states away from the special fillings @xmath12 , which are described in terms of states in which the topmost @xmath2 level contains only a few composite fermions [ when @xmath13 or a few holes [ when @xmath14 ; these are sometimes called cf - quasiparticles or cf - quasiholes .",
    "the energy level counting for the states containing many cf - quasiparticles or cf - quasiholes can be obtained very simply by modeling them as noninteracting fermions at an effective magnetic field ; the residual interaction , however , will convert the exact degeneracy into a quasi - degeneracy .",
    "the topological character of the fqhe states is believed also to manifest itself through adiabatic braiding properties of far separated quasiparticles or quasiholes , which are interpreted in terms of fractional braiding statistics.@xcite this concept was first introduced by halperin @xcite , and can also be derived within the cf theory @xcite .",
    "other wave functions have been constructed with different topological content .",
    "many of these wave functions@xcite represent unique , maximum density zero - energy ground states of model hamiltonians that do not have a two - body interaction but impose a penalty when three or more particles occupy a finite number of relative angular momentum states .",
    "special cases have been named pfaffian,@xcite parafermion,@xcite haffnian,@xcite or gaffnian,@xcite but all of these wave functions can be expressed conveniently as fully antisymmetrized correlated multicomponent wave functions , and also have been interpretated as certain correlation functions of appropriately chosen conformal field theories .",
    "the so - called  jack \" wave functions , are obtained from a root state with the help of certain squeezing rules.@xcite some of these states have been argued to support excitations that satisfy nonabelian braiding statistics.@xcite    one may ask , what is the motivation for constructing new wave functions ? ( they may turn out to be useful in other contexts , but we confine our attention to the fqhe here . ) for the lowest landau level physics , one may hope to discover a principle for the fqhe that is more fundamental and / or more accurate than that of composite fermions . given the successes of the cf theory for the lowest landau level phenomenology , and the fact that composite fermions have been directly observed , it would seem sensible that any new principle must recover , at the least , composite fermions and their physics , such as effective magnetic field , @xmath2 levels , unification of the fqhe and the iqhe , etc .    in our opinion ,",
    "the primary motivation for seeking new fqhe wave functions comes from fqhe in _ higher _ landau levels @xcite which is not as well - described by the cf theory as the lowest landau level fqhe .",
    "a well - studied case is the fqhe state at 5/2 , for which the most widely employed model considers a pfaffian wave function proposed by moore and read.@xcite while this is a paired state of composite fermions , thus also a part of the cf paradigm , it is also the exact ground state of a model three body interaction which entails an energy cost when three particles occupy the lowest allowed angular momentum state , but no energy cost when two particles approach one another .",
    "( this will be referred to as the  pfaffian model hamiltonian \" below . )",
    "the pfaffian wave function has been shown to have a reasonably good overlap with the exact coulomb ground state,@xcite which has motivated other wave functions that are exact ground states of generalized multi - particle interactions .",
    ".[overlap ] overlaps between the exact coulomb ground state @xmath15 , the gaffnian state @xmath16 , and the composite fermion state @xmath17 at @xmath0 in the spherical geometry .",
    "also shown are the dimensionalities of the hilbert space in the @xmath18 sector ( @xmath19 ) and the @xmath20 sector ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "some of the overlaps were given previously ( @xmath22 in ref .  ; @xmath23 in ref .",
    "for up to 14 particles ; @xmath24 for @xmath25 in ref .  ) , but are included here for completeness . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the character change of the excitations in this manner might at first seem surprising , but , with further thought , it is actually to be anticipated . essentially , whenever we have a vastly degenerate set of states , turning on even a slight perturbation can have nonperturbative consequences .",
    "it is instructive to review some other known examples in the context of the fqhe , which strongly suggest that a hilbert space reduction / rearrangement is not just possible , but is very likely to be generic .",
    "\\(i ) the first example is the fqhe itself . for noninteracting electrons",
    ", there is a vast degeneracy of many body ground states in the lowest landau level .",
    "the introduction of an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction creates composite fermions and the lowest landau level splits into their @xmath2 levels , which reduces the degeneracy by opening new gaps in the spectrum .",
    "\\(ii ) the hard - core model interaction @xmath26 , which acts only upon two electrons with relative angular momentum one , produces a large number of degenerate states of the form @xmath27\\ ] ] for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 $ ] is a symmetric polynomial of the electron coordinates .",
    "the degeneracy is equal to the number of partitions of @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is the number of additional flux quanta relative to the state at @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , this does not represent the correct physics , as is most obvious from the fact that it misses a large number of fqhe states with @xmath28 , such as that at 2/7 .",
    "a different model for this region is in terms of composite fermions carrying four inverse vortices ( also known as reverse flux attachment).@xcite the wave function is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 gives a fqhe state at 1/3 and @xmath34 gives a fqhe state at 2/7 .",
    "[ @xmath35 corresponds to @xmath36 . ]",
    "the counting of states from this prescription as the filling factor is changed from 1/3 to 1/4 is in one - to - one correspondence with the counting from filling factor @xmath33 to @xmath37 , which is in general much smaller than that predicted by the @xmath38 model , and , in particular , gives unique ground state at @xmath36 .",
    "from the perspective of the @xmath38 model , the residual interaction causes a nonperturbative rearrangement of the low - energy states .",
    "thus , even though the 1/3 state evolves continuously as we go from @xmath38 to the full coulomb interaction , the structure on the quasihole side changes in a qualitative manner .",
    "( even lower filling factors can be similarly understood in terms of composite fermions with appropriate number of vortices attached to them . )",
    "it is worth noting that the cf states ( which are essentially exact ) are contained very accurately within the subspace of states that have zero - energy for the @xmath38 interaction .",
    "\\(iii ) consider composite fermion states @xmath39 for a nonintegral @xmath40 .",
    "the model of noninteracting composite fermions predicts a band of quasi - degenerate states , whose dimensions can be determined straightforwardly by analogy to iqhe at @xmath40 .",
    "however , it is likely that any residual interaction between composite fermions in the partially filled @xmath2 level will cause a rearrangement of the states , thereby further reducing the dimension of the low - energy hilbert space .",
    "for example , for certain values of @xmath40 the cf - quasiparticles can arrange themselves into a crystal or stripes;@xcite and for certain other values of @xmath40 they can form their own fqhe state@xcite ( which produces fractions@xcite such as 4/11 ) for which the quasiparticles are very different from those of 1/3 or 2/5 .",
    "this is again an example where the low - energy hilbert space is qualitatively altered due to the weak residual interaction between the quasiparticles .",
    "note that the rearrangement can possibly occur entirely within the partially filled @xmath2 level , without closing the @xmath2 level gap .",
    "it should be noted that the phase transitions discussed in these examples , due to the turning on of the  rest of the interaction , \" are  topological , \" beccause the new state is described in terms of composite fermions carrying a different number of vortices ; also the new quasiparticles have different fractional local charge and braiding statistics .    in summary",
    ", we have examined the gaffnian model for the 2/5 fqhe and found that , while it gives a reasonably accurate wave function for the 2/5 coulomb ground state ( at least for small systems ) , it is inadequate for quasiholes .",
    "this study has general implications for fqhe beyond the 2/5 state .",
    "most importantly , it shows , not surprisingly , that a consideration of the ground state alone is insufficient for the demonstration of the validity of a model ; it is necessary to test it for excitations as well , because two ground state wave functions that a have high overlap can have qualitatively distinct quasiparticles .",
