    "the diamagnetic contribution to the magnetization is then derived from@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 although this subtraction leads to uncertainties in the high field limit , where the diamagnetic signal becomes small , it appears unlikely that the main feature , the occurrence of the minimum in @xmath31 at fixed temperature @xmath32 , is an artifact of this subtraction . although the crossover from the initial linear ( @xmath16 ) to nonlinear behavior is an expected feature of thermal fluctuations in homogeneous two ( 2d ) and three ( 3d ) dimensional superconductors , the occurrence of the minimum",
