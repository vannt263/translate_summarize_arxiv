    "in higher dimensions a true crystal , named wigner crystal , where the density is perfectly ordered , is possible when the repulsion between particles dominates over the kinetic energy in the case of small density . in one dimension , quantum fluctuations prevent any type of true spin - symmetry breaking and long - range order in the ground state , and thus the crystal does not have perfect order  @xcite .",

    ", we focus only on the  @xmath8 crossover \" in the density profiles : for vanishing and weak interactions the ground state is liquid - like with @xmath9-friedel oscillations , whereas at strong repulsions a periodicity of @xmath10-wigner oscillation emerges .    for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) harmonically trapped system of spin - balanced or imbalanced fermionic atomic gases ,",
    "many numerical schemes have been used in studying lots of interesting quantum effects  @xcite . a density - functional scheme using as reference the bethe - ansatz solvable homogeneous system was proposed to calculate the ground - state properties  @xcite .",
    "however , this approach was found to fail at the strong - coupling limit  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the exchange - correlation potential proposed there is not able to describe the @xmath11 crossover , which , as noted above , is expected to occur upon increasing the strength of the repulsive interactions between antiparallel - spin particles .",

    "for an unpolarized system , if a tiny magnetization which is proportional to the difference of the spin - up and spin - down densities is induced by hand into the exchange - correlation potential , the @xmath1-oscillation appears in the density profile at the expense of violating the lieb - mattis theorem , while for a polarized system , sdft can reproduce both the @xmath9 and @xmath7 oscillations without violating the lieb - mattis theorem  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the @xmath1 density oscillations is strongly related to the large fermi sea induced by the strong repulsion between different spin species  @xcite .",
    "some 1d systems , for example , the 1d gaudin - yang gas in a homogeneous continuum space , or the 1d lieb - wu model of particles in a discrete lattice , i.e. , 1d fermi - hubbard model , where the fermions interact through attractive or repulsive short - range interactions , are exactly solvable .",
    "however , in the inhomogeneous case only some special systems can be solved exactly .",
    "for example , the 1d two - component fermi gas in an infinite potential well can be solved exactly by the bethe - ansatz techniques , where the ground state properties are investigated  @xcite .",
    "the density profiles are evaluated from weak to very strong interactions . in the strongly interacting limit",
    ", the density profile tends to that of the spinless fermions though the momentum distributions differ .",
    "an exact analytical solution of 1d spin-1/2 fermions with infinite repulsion for arbitrary confining potential is obtained by the combination of girardeau s hard - core contacting boundary condition and group theoretical method  @xcite . for the spin - imbalanced case they found that the spin - up and spin - down density distributions show alternative peaks avoiding overlapping together and the parity symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we will employ the bethe - ansatz based sdft to investigate the 1d inhomogeneous system with general interaction strengths .",
