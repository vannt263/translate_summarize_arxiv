    "in any relativistic quantum field theory there inevitably appear positive energy solutions as well as negative energy ones  @xcite .",
    "these two kinds of solutions gave an obstacle when constructing second quantized theories .",
    "as is well known this obstacle was half solved long ago in the sense that p.  a.  m.  dirac  @xcite resolved this problem for the case of fermions by introducing a notion of negative energy sea , so called `` dirac sea '' , which consists of each state completely filled by one negative energy particle thanks to pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "thus the vacuum state of fermions are identified as such a state that all the positive energy solutions are empty and all the negative energy ones completely filled , and thus form the dirac sea .",
    "furthermore he interpreted a hole in the dirac sea as an anti - particle .",
    "however his dirac sea method passing to the second quantized theory is not applicable to boson theories simply , because of lack of the pauli s principle so that infinite number of particles can exist at each negative energy state .",
    "therefore one can not define properly totally filled negative energy states for bosons .",
    "needless to say that modern procedure of second quantization of fermions as well as bosons are well established without recourse to the dirac sea method for fermions . nevertheless to investigate a physical account of some problems in quantum field theory , the most famous one why chiral or axial anomaly appears in fermions , the dirac sea method provides exceedingly well physical interpretation of this phenomenon  @xcite . furthermore along the line with dirac sea method , a new peculiar effect in quantum field theory was found",
    "in fact the fractional fermion number was first discussed by r.  jackiw  @xcite and successively jackiw and j.  r.  schrieffer  @xcite pointed out that this is realized in a one dimensional polymer of which properties were investigated in detail .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to present a consistent formulation of the second quantization method by introducing negative energy seas , i.e. , dirac seas not only for fermions but also for bosons .",
    "in fact some of the present authors have been struggling past few years for obtaining consistent formulation  @xcite .",
    "however these previous attempts had a serious drawback : the inner product of the bosonic states of the negative energy became indefinite .",
    "of course the indefinite norm squared contradicts with the principle of quantum mechanics , and we might not be able to construct the hilbert space .",
    "thus the formulation was not well unacceptable .    in the present article , we propose a way out of the above mentioned difficulty of the indefinite inner product .",
    "our new method presented in this paper provides positive definite inner product and the hilbert space is consequently constructed .",
    "we would like to stress the motivation as to why we consider the old and in some sense already solved problem of the method of second quantization of relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "the motivation is two fold : one of them is , as is stated already above , that the dirac sea method provide well physical account for anomalous phenomena due to existence of bottomless of negative energy sea , such as chiral anomaly .",
    "we may expect to understand as well other anomalies in case of bosons , such as conformal anomaly .",
    "another motivation is that in the string theory , in which only the light cone gauge approach is successful in practice . indeed despite of many elaborate attempts , the only light - cone string field theory by kaku - kikkawa  @xcite seems to be successful in the sense of consistency .",
    "we suspect that the success of the light - cone string field theory is due to cutting out and disregard all negative energy modes .",
    "we would like to apply the method presented in this article to string theories and construct a new kind of string field theories which will include not only positive energy modes but also negative ones .",
    "supersymmetry is , at first , used as a kind of device to construct each state in boson theories as well as fermion ones at equal footing .",
    "therefore by imposing supersymmetry we may be able transparently to construct the vacua of bosons like fermion s dirac sea which will be in fact the case in our approach as will be described in the later sections .",
    "furthermore , the vacuum structure of supersymmetric theories itself is interesting enough to investigate , i.g .",
    ", whether boson and fermion vacua are really supersymmetric etc .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in the following section 2 , we investigate an @xmath8 supersymmetric theory to obtain basic relations for the boson sea .",
    "we find that the ordinary bosonic vacuum conflicts with the fermionic dirac sea due to the supersymmetry . a new condition for bosonic vacuum in terms of operator relations are derived .",
    "the condition indicates that the vacuum vanishes by an operation of the creation operator for any negative energy particle .",
    "this means that the bosonic vacuum is just boson sea because the condition is equivalent to that for the fermionic dirac sea . in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce a method of a double harmonic oscillator to formulate the boson sea .",
    "we extend the concept of the wave function of the harmonic oscillator to describe not only the positive energy states but also the negative energy ones .",
    "the resultant vacuum corresponds with the boson sea , which satisfies the condition derived in section 2 . in section 4 , we consider the inner product to construct the hilbert space of the double harmonic oscillator .",
    "we propose a successful definition of the positive definite inner product by employing _ a non - local approach_. in section 5 , we consider several mathematical properties of the negative number sector . in section 6",
    ", we discuss the physical meaning of the boson sea by comparing the dirac sea , and how the boson sea is filled by negative energy particles . in section 7 , we formulate the boson sea as a vacuum of the second quantization of bosonic fields by applying the double harmonic oscillator .",
    "we confirm physical consistency of the formulation .",
    "section 8 is devoted to a conclusion and a brief overview of possible future developments .",
    "in this section , we derive several basic relations for the boson sea with recourse to supersymmetry in @xmath9-dimensional space - time .",
    "we utilize the free field theory with @xmath8 supersymmetry  @xcite , because the simplest theory including a dirac fermion is @xmath8 supersymmetric one .",
    "the fermionic vacuum is taken to be the dirac sea .",
    "we find difficulties of making supersymmetry when the boson fields are quantized by the ordinary scheme rather than our boson sea formulation .",
    "therefore the supersymmetry requires the boson sea .",
    "the boson sea should be consistent with the fermionic dirac sea from the point of view of supersymmetry .",
    "the consistency provides several properties of the boson sea .",
    "hereafter , the greek indices @xmath10 take integer value from 0 to 3 and indicate coordinates of the minkowski space . through this paper",
    "the metric is given by @xmath11 , and the gamma matrices @xmath12 satisfy the ordinary anti - commutation relations .",

    "the noether current associated with the supersymmetry ( [ 2.2 ] ) gives the supercurrent as @xmath22 and thus the supercharges of the system are defined as @xmath23 with the flavor index @xmath18 .",
    "these supercharges play the important role for deriving the property of the boson sea .      in order to clearly specify the dirac sea for bosons",
    ", we briefly summarize the dirac sea formalism for fermions as well as the ordinary quantization formalism for bosons .",
    "the mode expansions of the field operators are formally given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is positive energy of the particle , and @xmath26 denotes the helicity .",
    "as is well known , the positive energy particles are related with the operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the negative energy ones are related with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the commutation relations among these operators are written as @xmath31      & = &      + \\delta_{ij}\\delta^3(\\vec{k}-\\vec{k}^{\\prime } ) ,      \\label{b+com}\\\\      \\left[a_{i-}(\\vec{k}),a_{j-}^{\\dagger}(\\vec{k}^{\\prime})\\right ]      & = &      -\\delta_{ij}\\delta^3(\\vec{k}-\\vec{k}^{\\prime } ) ,      \\label{b - com}\\\\      \\left\\{b(\\vec{k},s),b^{\\dagger}(\\vec{k}^{\\prime},s^{\\prime})\\right\\ }      \\ & = &      + \\delta_{ss^{\\prime}}\\delta^3(\\vec{k}-\\vec{k}^{\\prime } ) ,      \\label{f+com}\\\\      \\left\\{d(\\vec{k},s),d^{\\dagger}(\\vec{k}^{\\prime},s^{\\prime})\\right\\ }      \\ : & = &      + \\delta_{ss^{\\prime}}\\delta^3(\\vec{k}-\\vec{k}^{\\prime } ) ,      \\label{f - com}\\label{2.17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while all other pairs are commuting or anti - commuting .",
    "it is important that the right - hand side of the commutation relation ( [ b - com ] ) for negative energy bosons has the opposite sign to those of ( [ b+com ] ) for positive energy bosons .    in the ordinary context , these operators are naively interpreted as follows : @xmath32 here the particles with the energy - momentum @xmath33 have negative energy @xmath34 , because @xmath35 is defined as always positive one .",

    "we introduce new operators @xmath49 for the negative energy particles .",
    "this introduction of these operators is essential in the scheme , because the role of the creation and annihilation operators is inverted .",

    "in fact , in ordinary theory as one can see , the negative energy vacuum @xmath54 is annihilated by annihilation operator @xmath59 , while in our method the corresponding vacuum @xmath60 is annihilated by the creation operator @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we just find that the ordinary boson scheme conflicts with the dirac sea formulation that respects the supersymmetry .    the conditions ( [ 2.24 ] ) and ( [ 2.25 ] ) seems to be an evidence for boson sea .",
    "these conditions are the same as the relations ( [ fermion_vacuum_condition+ ] ) and ( [ fermion_vacuum_condition- ] ) for the dirac sea . the vacuum @xmath62 corresponds the empty vacuum which vanishes by the annihilation operator @xmath63 .",

    "we determine the explicit form of @xmath71 in the following : the negative number sector is formally given by simple replacement @xmath83 in the positive number sector : @xmath84 by this replacement , the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the negative number sector are obtained as @xmath85 the hermite polynomial @xmath86 in ( [ 3.14 ] ) is either purely real or purely imaginary , because @xmath68 is either an even or odd function of @xmath76 . by extending the hermite polynomial to negative @xmath87",

    "when this condition is imposed , the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator turns out to become only positive number sector .",

    "the negative number sector is independent of the positive one , because any state in the negative number sector can not be derived by finite operations of creation and annihilation operators on the positive number sector .",

    "this property reproduces that anti - particles as holes in the boson sea have positive energy .",

    "the probability means the number of the particles in the second quantization .",
    "the vacuum of the positive energy sector has a strong peak at @xmath374 , because the wave functional @xmath375 is multiplication of gaussian functions for any @xmath353 ( see in fig .",

    "we study the exited states , namely , the particles and the holes by considering the energy and momentum of the states .",
    "in this subsection we omit the subscript of the flavor index @xmath16 for simplicity .",
    "the momentum operator is derived by noether s theorem : @xmath377 by using the commutation relations ( [ b+com ] ) and ( [ b - com ] ) , the momentum operator becomes @xmath378    we calculate energy and momentum of the vacuum @xmath379 as eigenvalues : @xmath380 which indicates that the vacuum energy @xmath381 is divergent .",
    "when we have a supersymmetry , the bosonic vacuum energy in ( [ 4.15 ] ) is exactly canceled by the fermionic one .",
    "the energy - momenta of the first excited states are calculated similarly : @xmath382 these results tell us that both the operations of @xmath383 and @xmath384 on the vacuum increase the energy - momentum of the state by an amount @xmath385 .",
    "the interpretation of the positive energy particle state @xmath383 is the usual one , namely , one particle of energy - momentum @xmath385 is created on the empty vacuum . because annihilation of negative energy particles corresponds with the creation of holes of positive energy , the action of the annihilation operator @xmath384 on the boson sea creates a bosonic hole of the momentum @xmath385 .",
    "the hole is just the anti - particle .",
    "all other higher states are interpreted in the same manner .",
    "therefore , the natural definition of the momentum operator @xmath386 in ( [ 4.14 ] ) is consistent with our formulation .",
    "we conclude that all the excited states , namely , the particles and the holes have positive energies .",
    "we have proposed a consistent formulation of the _ boson sea _ which is a bosonic version of the dirac sea .",
    "our formulation shows that the boson vacuum forms a sea of bosons and the bosonic holes in the sea are interpreted as anti - particles .",
    "to formulate the boson sea , we have introduced the double harmonic oscillator , the indefinite metric , and a new definition of the inner product .",
    "the non - local approach is employed to define the positive definite inner product .",
    "the double harmonic oscillator allows us to consider the negative number states , and is essential to realize the boson sea .",
    "the negative energy solution of the field equation belongs to the negative number sector , then the bosonic hole in the boson sea always has positive energy .",
    "we summarize an analogy between the dirac sea and the boson sea in table  [ analogy ] .",
    ".analogy between fermion and boson sea [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     supersymmetry has played an important role to develop our method as the guiding principle of the boson sea . therefore , our method is also natural when we consider supersymmetry .",
    "our method treats bosons and fermions on an equal footing as the seas .",
    "the concept of the boson sea is widely applicable to quantum physics .",
    "the string theories and the string field theories have been successfully quantized only by the light - cone quantization method  @xcite . however , there are no satisfactory theories of the covariant quantization of the string field at the present time .",
    "the first quantization of the string theory is performed by the commutation relation for the world sheet coordinates @xmath387 as @xmath388      = i\\eta^{\\mu \\nu}\\delta ( \\sigma -\\sigma^{\\prime } ) ,      & \\label{string - com}\\\\      &      \\quad \\eta^{\\mu \\nu}={\\rm diag}(-1,+1,\\cdots , + 1 ) .      & \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this commutator has a negative sign for @xmath389 due to the metric element @xmath390 of the target space .",
    "this property qualitatively coincides with the commutation relation ( [ b - com ] ) for the theory of the complex scalar field . in the light - cone quantization ,",
    "the essential point of success is the disappearance of the the negative energy states caused by this negative sign of the commutator .",
    "we expect that the covariant quantization of the string field may well be obtained by the proper treatment of the negative energy states in the string .",
    "because our method allows us to consider negative energy states , our method may be useful for this purpose .    in this paper ,",
    "we have succeeded in constructing the boson sea formalism for free field theories .",
    "the way of constructing the perturbation theory for interacting fields without external fields is almost same as that for ordinary field theories . in the perturbation theory of the ordinary field theory ,",
    "the perturbative expansion is described by sum of the many harmonic oscillator system , and the harmonic oscillators are not deformed .",
    "it is just the same situation with the perturbation theory in our formalism . in this sense",
    ", there arises no difference and no ambiguity among the ordinary field theory and our formalism . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation is changed when we switch on the external fields or consider the non - perturbative properties .",
    "one of the most important cases is the anomaly .    also in analogy with the intuitive understanding and derivation of the chiral anomaly of the massless fermion as pair creation from the dirac sea  @xcite",
    ", we may expect to obtain a new insight about boson anomaly such as the conformal anomaly .",
    "furthermore there is a possibility that the boson propagator may be modified by the effect of the boson sea .",
    "when we consider interactions and external fields , it is expected that the interactions amang a particle , the boson sea and the external fields modify the behavior of the particle .    before closing the present article ,",
    "an announcement is in order . in this paper the inner product of the system of the double harmonic oscillator",
    "is defined in the non - local method as is presented in section 4 , which proves to be positive definiteness of the inner product .",
    "however this non - local method is not only one way to provide a positive definite inner product . in the successive paper [ arxiv : hep - th/0607182 ] in our series of this subject , we in fact show another method which is a kind of @xmath391-regularization and renormalization method , and it also provides positive definite one .",
