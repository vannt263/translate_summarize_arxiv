    "dynamical friction , the reaction force a perturber feels from the gravitational wake it excites in the ambient medium , is one of the fundamental processes in the formation of astronomical structures .",
    "applications of dynamical friction to collisionless systems include mass segregation in star clusters @xcite , galaxy distribution in hierarchical cluster formation @xcite , the decay of satellites in galactic halos and galaxy mergers @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "dynamical friction also occurs in collisional particle systems and was applied to the study of the growth of planetesimals @xcite , the eccentricity excitation of planetary embryo orbits @xcite , and the confinement of planetary rings @xcite . for gaseous systems ,",
    "applications include the orbital decay of compact stars orbiting supermassive black holes @xcite , the heating of intercluster gas by decelerating supersonic galaxies @xcite , the characterization of the differences in x - ray emissions in galaxy clusters between the standard cold dark matter model and modified newtonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "boundaries appear in dynamical friction because both the perturber and the ambient medium that surrounds it have finite sizes . in the common analyses of dynamical friction",
    ", these two boundaries enter the force through the coulomb logarithm that requires cutoffs at small and large distances from the perturber to avoid divergence . in the context of collisionless systems , the classical derivation of dynamical friction",
    "using a perturber in uniform rectilinear motion @xcite leaves the choice of the two cutoffs somewhat indeterminate and gives the force as : @xmath0\\frac{\\bm v}{v^3 } , \\label{chandra}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the gravitational constant , @xmath2 is the perturber s mass , @xmath3 is the individual mass of a background medium star , @xmath4 is the perturber s velocity , @xmath5 is the medium s velocity distribution function , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the small and large distance cutoffs respectively . the small distance cutoff , @xmath6 ,",
    "is believed to be the larger of the perturber s radius and the distance related to the typical velocity in the ambient medium whereas the larger cutoff radius , @xmath7 , is usually taken as the size of the system ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "a more accurate analysis of the gravitational scattering of a star in rectilinear motion in a collisionless infinite system @xcite , shows that there is a natural large distance cutoff that equals the distance travelled by the perturber , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the time the perturber takes crossing the medium .",
    "this cutoff arises for durations smaller than the crossing time because the far stars do not have enough time to completely deflect the perturber by the standard ( asymptotic ) angle that depends only on the distance to the perturber and its velocity but not on time .",
    "the farther the star , the more incomplete the deflection , leading to a scattering angle that depends on time .",
    "equivalently , it can be shown that only stars with impact parameters smaller than @xmath8 substantially affect the perturber s velocity .",
    "this analysis was applied to accurately estimate the relaxation time in an infinite dilute star system @xcite .",
    "when steady state is considered , the distance travelled by the perturber becomes comparable to the system s size and the upper cutoff , @xmath7 , is taken as the system s size .",
    "similar prescriptions are applied to circular motion in spherically symmetric systems where it is shown that only the vicinity of resonances within the system contribute to dynamical friction @xcite including the standard long and short distance cutoffs .    for a perturber moving in a gaseous medium , the small distance cutoff",
    "is taken as the perturber s accretion radius or physical size .",
    "the large distance cutoff depends on the perturbation regime . in steady state",
    ", it is taken as the system s size @xcite whereas in the time - dependent regime , in which the perturbation s duration is much smaller than the crossing time , it is given by the distance travelled by the sonic shockwave that the perturber excites in the medium @xcite and @xcite hereafter paper i. although the nature of the large distant cutoffs used to truncate the density perturbation is of different physical origin for collisionless and collisional media , the corresponding friction forces are similar @xcite .    in both collisionless and collisional media ,",
    "dynamical friction was determined in the two limiting cases of steady state and the time - dependent regime . for the latter ,",
    "the independence of dynamical friction of the medium s size is straightforward as the perturbed region that acts back on the perturber is much smaller than the ambient medium .",
    "the situation is much less clear for steady state in which the density enhancement raised by the perturber has reached the medium s boundary .",
    "suppose for instance that a perturber is set in motion near the boundary of a gaseous medium such that the distance the sonic shockwave has to travel to reach the boundary is much smaller than the medium s size .",
    "before the shockwave reaches the boundary , dynamical friction is in the time - dependent regime .",
    "however as the boundary is reached , the medium s full size can not serve as a large distance cutoff . instead",
    ", the proximity of the perturbed region to the medium s boundary will affect the way the density enhancement acts back on the perturber depending on how the boundary responds to an incoming shockwave .",
    "it is the object of this paper to find out how dynamical friction may be changed as the perturber s shockwave reaches the medium s boundary .",
    "as such a task is quite difficult , we will make a number of simplifying assumptions aimed at illustrating that the classical behavior of dynamical friction may be changed drastically because of the presence of a boundary .",
    "we assume that the perturber moves in a homogeneous gaseous medium along a rectilinear trajectory with uniform velocity near the medium s boundary that is taken to be planar and reflecting .",
    "the boundary s curvature is neglected as the medium s size is supposed to be large compared to the perturber s distance to the boundary .",
    "wake reflection at a medium s boundary may occur at the edges of truncated disks perturbed by planetary or stellar companions @xcite as well as in numerical simulations of planet - disk interaction with no - outflow",
    "boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we shall show that most of the significant changes on dynamical friction come not from the reflected component but from the truncation of the shockwave incident on the boundary . to derive the friction force for this set - up",
    ", we shall use the general expression of dynamical friction derived in paper i that allowed us to study the influence of a perturber s acceleration on dynamical friction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we recall the general expression of dynamical friction derived in paper i and characterize how the medium s size affects dynamical friction in general . in section 3 , we derive the dynamical friction force for a perturber moving normal to the medium s boundary and show that perturbers are pushed away from the boundary and reach a finite terminal velocity . in section 4",
    ", we examine dynamical friction for motion parallel to the boundary and show the appearance of an additional force component normal the trajectory that pushes the perturber away from the boundary .",
    "section 5 includes a summary of main results and possible further refinements . in appendix",
    "a , we characterize the gas flow forced by the perturbers in the configurations studied in sections 3 and 4 by deriving the corresponding velocity field and density perturbation and linking them to the known results of the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion .",

    "the phase @xmath29 , the upper radial cutoff at the retarded sonic shockwave @xmath30 , and the boundary conditions are all that is necessary to compute the friction force .",
    "in particular , as the force expression is independent of the density perturbation , no explicit expression for the density enhancement is required for the force calculation ( for more details see paper i ) .",
    "the derivation of expression ( [ force ] ) assumes that the perturber is set in motion at @xmath31 a fact that introduces the size of the retarded sonic shockwave as an upper cutoff .",
    "this assumption is not restrictive as it allows us to study the time - dependent evolution of dynamical friction as well approximate steady state behaviour .",
    "it models a perturber that just entered the ambient medium such as a star cluster or a dwarf galaxy that fall into a larger galaxy .",
    "it also describes turning on a numerical simulation of dynamical friction @xcite .",

    "the first three conditions yield the following integration domains : @xmath49 the fourth condition depends on the distance @xmath50 travelled by the retarded wavefront ; it sets the dynamical friction regime : time - dependent or steady state . in the time dependent - regime , ( @xmath51 ) , the sonic shockwave has not reached the medium s boundary whereas in the steady state regime , ( @xmath52 ) , the peturbation has travelled the size of the medium . calling @xmath53 the integral that appears in ( [ force3 ] )",

    "the cancellation for subsonic perturbers happens only because of the choice of an outer boundary that is symmetric with respect to the perturber and comoves with it , i.e. @xmath41 ; the two conditions are necessary .",

    "when @xmath63 , the asymmetric part of the density perturbation inside the sonic wavefront results in dynamical friction . as the wavefront reaches the comoving symmetric boundary , friction decreases and tends to zero when @xmath64 as the density perturbation artificially acquires front - back symmetry with respect to the perturber ( figure 1 , bottom left panel )",
    "however , this explanation that is based on the specifics of the density perturbation works only when uniform motion is considered as in general , motion is accelerated ( or decelerated ) , as by dynamical friction itself , and the density enhancement generated by accelerated motion nowhere has front - back symmetry ( paper i ) . discarding the unphysical assumption of truncating the force at large distances using a comoving symmetric boundary ( which is equivalent to implicitly assuming that perturber is at the center of a symmetric medium ) will lead to significant changes in dynamical friction as suggested by figure 1 ( right column ) where the surfaces of equal density are shown for a subsonic perturber in a medium with an arbitrary shaped boundary that does not comove with the perturber .",
    "as the sonic wavefront reaches the outer boundary , the density enhancement becomes asymmetric with respect to the perturber and friction is not only finite but will have a component perpendicular to the perturber s trajectory . in the following two sections ,",
    "we examine a simpler boundary and show quantitatively that the properties of dynamical friction change significantly when the assumption of a comoving symmetric boundary is discarded .",
    "we also remark that most of our conclusions regarding the use of a comoving symmetric boundary apply to collisionless systems . in effect , for rectilinear motion , the derivation of dynamical friction from the velocity impulse caused by a test star on the perturber is invariably centered around the latter .",
    "when steady state is considered , the cutoff @xmath7 is used in the perturber - centered frame which is equivalent to assuming a comoving symmetric boundary .",
    "as discussed in the previous section and shown in figure 1 , dynamical friction in the presence of a boundary unrelated to the perturber has parallel and normal components to the perturber s motion . to study each component separately ,",
    "we choose perturbers that move normal to the boundary ( this section ) and parallel to the boundary ( section 4 ) .",
    "we therefore consider an infinite medium with a reflecting planar boundary that occupies the space @xmath65 and a perturber of trajectory @xmath66 where @xmath33 is the unit vector normal to the boundary .",
    "this setup models dynamical friction on a perturber whose outgoing wake has reached the nearest part of the medium s boundary or one that has just entered a gaseous medium .",
    "the assumption of a planar boundary is valid if the perturber is not near the physical center of the medium .",
    "no other forces apply to the perturber in its motion in the medium .",
    "as the boundary is reflecting , the perturber s density enhancement will have two components : the outgoing wake incident on the boundary and truncated by it , and a reflected wake .",
    "the reflection assumption serves two purposes , first as the large distance cutoff ( akin to the small distance cutoff ) is commonly used to truncate the density enhancement and estimate dynamical friction , the outgoing wake truncated at the boundary will not be affected by reflection ; the corresponding force would be the same for a non - reflecting boundary .",
    "second , at little extra computational cost , we obtain the force caused by the reflected wake .",
    "wake reflection at a medium s boundary occurs for instance at the edges of truncated disks perturbed by planetary or stellar companions @xcite as well as in numerical simulations of planet - disk interaction with no - outflow boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the sonic shockwave excited by the perturber reaches the boundary at @xmath67 .",
    "prior to this time ( @xmath68 ) , the reaction force from the wake on the perturber is that of the time - dependent regime ( [ ostriker ] ) . for later times ,",
    "dynamical friction remains along the direction of the perturber s motion because the medium s boundary has a rotational symmetry with respect to the perturber s trajectory .",
    "we consider separately the forces from the outgoing and reflected wakes and assume that the perturber is not close to the boundary , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "analytic expressions as well as portraits of the density perturbation and velocity fields are given in appendix a. for the outgoing wake of a perturber moving away from the boundary , the geometrical truncation of the density perturbation will reduce dynamical friction .",
    "as the surfaces of equal density are symmetric with respect to the perturber , truncating part of the wake on the side opposite the perturber s motion ( appendix a , figure 9 ) will effectively reduce the drag behind the perturber . in fact , we show below that the situation is more dramatic for slow subsonic perturbers as truncation reverses the direction of the force .",
    "the reflected wake remains behind the perturber for supersonic motion and overtakes the perturber at @xmath70 for subsonic perturbers . before this time and at all times for supersonic motion ,",
    "the reflected wake is simply an additional density enhancement behind the perturber and increases the drag above that felt in an infinite medium because the same part of the wake is now closer to the perturber .",
    "after the reflected wake has overtaken a subsonic perturber , the amplitude of its drag decreases .",
    "we show below that its friction force may be reversed for slow subsonic motion in manner similar to that of the outgoing wake s force .",
    "dynamical friction is derived for times @xmath71 .",
    "the first condition defines a local steady state with respect to the boundary nearest to the perturber and the second condition ensures that we do not follow the perturber s wakes ( outgoing and reflected ) as they reach and bounce off the whole ( closed ) physical boundary of the medium . for a perturber moving towards the boundary , dynamical friction is derived for times @xmath72 prior to the perturber s exit from the medium .",
    "only subsonic motion is considered as the boundary ahead of a supersonic perturber does not affect dynamical friction .",
    "we first assume that the perturber moves away from the boundary ( i.e. @xmath73 ) .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath74 written in terms of the variables of expression ( [ force3 ] ) becomes @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the condition that the volume that contributes to the force be that inside the retarded sonic wavefront , i.e. @xmath30 , then implies that @xmath77 and @xmath78 only for @xmath79 . the integration domain related to",
    "the lower cutoff radius , @xmath42 , ( [ domain1 ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "for larger radii , we have : @xmath80 the domains ( [ domain1 ] ) and ( [ domain2i ] ) contribute force terms identical to those of equation ( [ ostriker ] ) except that @xmath50 is replaced with @xmath81 .",

    "as expected the truncation of the outgoing wake reduces the amplitude of the force for subsonic as well as supersonic perturbers that travel away from the boundary . for subsonic perturbers moving toward the boundary ,",
    "the truncation of the wake region ahead of the perturber increases the dynamical drag as more weight is given to the density enhancement behind the perturber . for @xmath90",
    ", the truncation of the wake leads to the acceleration of the perturber away from the boundary .",
    "motion at @xmath91 is in stable equilibrium as for larger ( smaller ) velocities the force decelerates ( accelerates ) the perturber .",

    "local steady state is reached after a transitory period where the reflected wake is located in the vicinity of the boundary and does not cross the perturber s trajectory .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath148 initially pulls the perturber to the boundary before reaching its asymptotic positive value that is proportional to @xmath168 . like the force from the outgoing wake , @xmath148 is maximal at @xmath150 .",
    "the analytical expressions of the normal force from the reflected wake in the local steady state regime , @xmath151 , are identical to those of the outgoing wake ( [ fxlimss],[fxlimss1],[fxlimss2 ] ) .",

    "the force along the trajectory is comparable in amplitude to that in an infinite medium except in the neighborhood of mach 1 where its is larger by about 15% , a trend that is opposite to that of the friction force acting on a perturber moving normal to the boundary .",
    "the force normal to the trajectory increases linearly with @xmath169 ( for @xmath170 ) and is maximal at mach 1 . for @xmath171 , @xmath172",
    "whereas for @xmath173 , @xmath174 .",
    "we note that like for motion normal to the boundary , the gravitational wakes tend to push the perturber away from the boundary .",
    "we set out to examine the effect of the presence of a boundary on dynamical friction .",
    "we showed that the expressions of the force in infinite ( [ ostriker ] ) and finite ( [ steady1 ] ) media may not be used in the presence of a boundary such as the medium s outer and inner limits or any other internal edge .",
    "in particular , dynamical friction along the direction of motion may be reversed and a new drag component perpendicular to the boundary is present and forces the perturber to move away from the medium s edge .",
    "these results are of particular relevance for the numerical simulation of dynamical friction once the perturber s wake reaches the boundaries of the physical system or the simulation box as for instance in problems related to disk - planet interactions and galaxy merging where timescales are observed to differ significantly from the prediction of the chandrasekhar formula @xcite .",
    "we have considered separately motion normal and parallel to the boundary to isolate the effects of the instability of zero - velocity perturbers , the reversal of dynamical friction , and normal dynamical friction . whereas qualitatively accurate for a perturber on a trajectory inclined by an arbitrary angle with respect to the boundary , these effects may not be added quantitatively linearly because dynamical friction depends on the phase vectors @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "this is why it is not straightforward to carry over the first two effects to rotational motion in bounded systems ( such as disk - planet interactions ) as they would require the perturber s orbit to have some eccentricity and hence a velocity that makes a time - dependent angle with the boundary .",
    "normal dynamical friction however readily applies to circular motion in a spherical system .",
    "the dependence of the normal force on the distance to the boundary is translated for a perturber in circular motion around an attracting center as a radial force that depends on the orbital radius and the location of the medium s edge for subsonic perturbers , and additionally on the velocity for supersonic perturbers .",
    "this time - dependent force affects the perturber s energy but not its angular momentum and is most efficient where motion is resonant with the sound speed .    in our derivation of dynamical friction",
    ", we neglected the boundary s curvature .",
    "it is straightforward that for a perturber on a normal trajectory that moves away from a convex boundary , the friction force will be further reduced with respect to that given by ( [ incidentsub],[incidentsuper ] ) as the wake behind the perturber is truncated further ( as in figure 1 ) .",
    "the current analysis may also serve as a guide to examine the effect of the ambient medium s boundary in collisionless systems . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the derivation of dynamical friction from the velocity impulse caused by a test star on the perturber is centered physically around the latter @xcite .",
    "when steady state is considered , the large distance cutoff is applied in the perturber - centered frame which is equivalent to assuming a comoving symmetric boundary .",
    "although they differ in magnitude , the friction forces in a gaseous medium and a collisionless star system share a strong similarity in the way they depend on the mach number @xcite .",
    "such similarity suggests that the conclusions we found here will hold for collisionless systems .",
