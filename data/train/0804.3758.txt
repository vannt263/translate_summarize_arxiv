    "in recent years , microlasers have been an object of growing interest in the photonics community because of a remarkable promise in both basic and applied research .",
    "modern technology has facilitated fabrication of high-@xmath0 micro- and nanosized cavities ( microresonators ) in a vast variety of designs ( microdisks , -rings , -gears , -toroids , nanowires , nanoposts , and so on @xcite ) .",
    "lasers can be based on many of these set - ups as well as on different materials , e.g. , semiconductors , impurity ions , or dye molecules .",
    "in addition , periodic nanostructures ( photonic crystals , phcs ) can provide both cavity - based and distributed feedback resonators suitable for laser design @xcite .",
    "the cavity size , which becomes so small as to be comparable to the operating wavelength , is what makes a microlaser physically distinct from conventional ( `` bulk '' ) cavities whose size is far larger .",
    "the small size limits the number of cavity modes that could take part in lasing , and at the same time greatly increases the influence of the cavity shape on the character of the modes . as a result ,",
    "the mode structure becomes more complicated and heavily dependent on the specific cavity design .",
    "one is no longer able to describe the modes universally in an analytical manner .",
    "the variety of laser dynamics becomes much richer , which complicates the studies of microlasers to a considerable extent but at the same time can harbor interesting new effects .",
    "for example , one could look for new possibilities of bistable or multistable lasing @xcite , which would prove useful in many applications such as multiple - wavelength light sources , optical flip - flop devices or optical memory cells @xcite .    in the simplest case when two modes coexist in the same laser cavity ( competing for the same saturable gain medium ) ,",
    "three lasing regimes are usually considered @xcite .",
    "first , when one of the modes has an advantage ( e.g. , larger @xmath0-factor or better coupling to the gain ) , it simply dominates , becoming the only lasing mode ( _ single mode lasing _ ) .",
    "second , when the modes are well balanced ( i.e. , similar @xmath0-factors and equally well coupled to the gain ) , they can both lase simultaneously .",
    "such a coexistence can become possible because the modes with different frequency and/or spatial field pattern preferably interact with different gain centers . as a consequence , the spectral and spatial hole burning causes each mode to get saturated independently and allow the mode that happens to be weaker to catch up with the stronger one .",
    "each mode saturates itself more readily as it does the other mode ; in this sense , the coexisting modes are said to be _ weakly coupled _",
    "( _ simultaneous multimode lasing _ ) .",
    "third , if the reverse is true , i.e. , if each mode saturates the other mode before coming to its own saturation ( the modes are _ strongly coupled _ ) , the weaker mode is quenched by the stronger one before it has any chance to catch up .",
    "whichever mode has an initial advantage wins the competition and becomes the only lasing mode ( _ bistable multimode lasing _ ) .",
    "the system can lase in either mode and is in this sense bistable .    trying to understand the physical origin of strong mode coupling brings about certain problems .",
    "it was pointed out from the beginning @xcite that harmonic modes ( such as longitudinal modes in bulk cavities ) must always be coupled weakly because the antinodes of the field ( the regions where the light - matter interaction is maximized ) are spatially mismatched for different modes .",
    "spatial hole burning would work similarly for any two modes with mismatched intensity distribution ( such as transverse modes in bulk cavities ) .",
    "one of the ways to circumvent this limitation is to use degenerate modes with identical spatial intensity profiles , e.g. , polarization degenerate modes or counterpropagating modes in ring lasers .",
    "this can make the lasing bistable due to additional mode coupling through population pulsations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can place a saturable absorber in addition to the saturable gain medium into the cavity @xcite .",
    "such an absorber can be naturally realized when only a part of the active medium is pumped .",
    "both principles can be adapted for use in microlasers and are embodied in the form of polarization - bistable and absorptive bistable laser diodes @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that two coupled lasers can achieve bistability if the output from each laser is directed to the other one and the feedback is reduced to prevent formation of a compound cavity @xcite .",
    "later studies @xcite give a detailed account on the stability and mode locking regimes of bulk coupled lasers based on nonlinear bifurcation analysis of the corresponding rate equations .",
    "it is fundamentally problematic to achieve similar behavior in microlasers where the modes share the same cavity .",
    "recent achievements in the design of bistable multimode - interference laser diodes @xcite , though capable of bistable lasing within a cavity of sub - millimeter size , still require saturable absorbers for the device to function properly .    in the meantime ,",
    "recent results show that there are yet unexplored possibilities for bistable operation of microlasers .",
    "we have shown @xcite that a cavity based on coupled defects in a phc exhibits bistability without the need for saturable absorption or similar additional mechanisms .",
    "the same idea was seen to work in lasers based on multimode nanopillar waveguides @xcite .",
    "similar results have been reported based on coupled microdisk @xcite and coupled microring @xcite resonators , the latter proposed for an ultrafast , ultralow - power optical memory cell design .",
    "also , ref .",
    "@xcite reports that coupled multiple - feedback ring lasers can be brought to bistability by carefully selecting the feedback times , which may be more feasible in microlasers than the conventional gain - quenching scheme as in @xcite . finally , a time - independent multimode laser theory recently developed by h.  treci and co - workers @xcite reports that mode interaction can be very important in highly multimode nanostructure - based systems such as random lasers @xcite . in view of this",
    ", there is a pronounced need to address the question of bistability in microresonators with their specific features such as complex cavity shapes and mathematically complex cavity modes taken into account consistently .",
    "spatial hole burning should also be accounted for rigorously without reverting to averaging approximations , which are usually applied for coupled or semiconductor lasers @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the dynamics of two interacting modes in a microresonator - based laser . the semiclassical rate - equation model based on the maxwell - bloch equations is used to model a laser - active medium .",
    "coupled mode equations are derived and analyzed for different classes of laser dynamics .",
    "compared to existing accounts on mode dynamics and coupled lasers @xcite , no specific form is assumed for either the cavity or the mode geometry .",
    "the spatial distribution of population inversion is taken into account fully in terms of projections onto the modes subspace ( see @xcite ) for all classes of laser dynamics .",
    "the theory developed here can be seen as complementary to the account in refs .",
    "@xcite by being able to provide a description of time - dependent laser dynamics .",
    "though they are rather different , both these approaches go beyond the third - order nonlinearity in the description of light - matter interaction .    in the simplest case of class - a laser dynamics ,",
    "the equations suitable for analytical studies have been derived .",
    "as already shown earlier for some particular cases ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we confirm that coherent mode interaction ( population pulsations ) can result in bistable laser operation .",
    "we show that bistable lasing becomes increasingly more difficult to achieve as the intermode frequency spacing  @xmath1 increases from zero .",
    "however , for microcavity modes with well - matched intensity - gain overlap the bistability window has been shown to be much greater ( by up to several orders of magnitude with respect to  @xmath1 ) than for harmonic bulk - cavity modes .",
    "a non - symmetric system , where one of the modes is given an advantage through cavity design , is also investigated .",
    "we show that a parameter mismatch favoring one of the modes can be compensated for by an opposing mismatch in another parameter that would favor the other mode . in the more complicated class - b or class - c cases , numerical studies of the obtained coupled mode equations",
    "have been carried out .",
    "the effects of increasing the pumping rate and/or  @xmath1 beyond the applicability limits of the class - a approximations are studied .",
    "bistable lasing is seen to persist unless @xmath1  becomes comparable to the width of the gain line .",
    "even then , bistability can be further restored by increasing the pumping rate highly above threshold .",
    "the results obtained for the class - b / c microlaser systems in the framework of the coupled mode theory have been compared with full numerical finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) calculations .",
    "at least for the system considered ( coupled defects in a 2d photonic crystal as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we demonstrate that the predictions of the theory are in a good agreement with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : equations ] , we derive the semiclassical coupled two - mode laser equations suitable for a wide range of microcavity modes .",
    "only a few general assumptions about the cavity shape are made and no particular form for the mode geometry is specified .",
    "the derivation starts from the maxwell - bloch equations and is carried out from the more general ( class - c ) through the intermediate ( class - b ) to the most restrictive ( class - a ) laser dynamics .",
    "specific issues pertaining to introducing the dynamics classes in multimode lasers are addressed along the way .",
    "the analysis of the equations obtained is then carried out in the reverse order . in section  [ sec : class - a ] , we analyze the class - a case , which , with some assumptions , turns out to be closely related to the standard two - mode competition model @xcite . the parameter window of bistable operation",
    "is investigated in terms of the spatial and spectral mode properties . in section  [ sec : class - bc ] , class - b and class - c equations are numerically investigated , and the main differences with the class - a model as regards bistable lasing operation are discussed .",

    "these saturation terms would modify the spatial profile of @xmath30 outside the scope of eq .  .",
    "however , as eq .",
    "does not contain any explicit expansion in a series of nonlinearity orders with subsequent series truncation , the constraint on the pumping rate  @xmath13 appears to be much weaker than what is enforced by the usual near - threshold expansion @xcite , which explicitly retains only third - order nonlinearities in the hole burning interaction . in the extreme ( single - mode ) case , where eq .   implies @xmath31 and thus carries the strongest approximation , it can be shown that the coupled mode theory based on eq",

    "the dynamical behavior of the laser is also correctly predicted by the coupled mode theory employing the expansion   both for one and for two modes ( see our earlier work @xcite for a comparison with direct numerical simulations ) .",
    "that taken into account , in what follows we will use the expansion , remembering that the results may deviate quantitatively and may be subjest to further checking as the pumping rate goes far above threshold .      in order to derive the equations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , one has to eliminate all the spatial dependencies from eqs .",

    "for example , if fp2 is placed symmetrically , initial mode amplitude ratios  @xmath189 of 3:2 and 2:3 bring the first and the second mode to lasing , respectively ( fig .",

    ", fp2 needs to exist on the flow diagram , as imposed by @xmath235 . in the second place ,",
    "once fp2 exists , the mode coupling constant must exceed unity ( @xmath143 ) , as discussed before . first ( sec .  [ sub : cla - c ] ) , we have shown that in comparison to bulk - cavity lasers microlasers exhibit a much wider parameter window characterized by  @xmath143 , because the microcavity modes can better fulfill the intensity matching condition  . secondly ( sec .",
    "[ sub : cla - i12 ] ) , we have shown that there is an extended domain in the 3d perturbation space @xmath214 where @xmath235 . inside this domain ,",
    "the closer @xmath185  is to unity , the easier it is to realize bistability - based laser mode switching experimentally .",
    "we have shown that @xmath185 can be brought close to  1 by choosing a combination of perturbation parameters that would compensate each other s advantage given to either mode .",
    "the elegance of the class - a case considered in the previous section is that eqs .",
    "can be subject to analytical investigation based on a comparison with eqs .",
    "once a laser with a more complicated dynamics needs to be examined , more complicated systems of equations [ six equations   for class - b or eight equations   for class - c ] need to be dealt with .",
    "although attempts at analytical investigation of class - b equations are known ( e.g. , a near - threshold expansion of population inversion as proposed in @xcite ) , only numerical solution seems to be applicable in the general case when no specific assumptions on the cavity or mode geometry are implied .",
    "since all the equations are ordinary differential , such a numerical solution can be carried out with relative ease ",
    "the computational demands are far lower than a direct numerical integration of the maxwell - bloch equations by means of an fdtd - like scheme @xcite",
    ".    a systematic investigation of class - b / c microlasers would be too lengthy to include in the present paper and will be the subject of a forthcoming publication . in this section",
    "we will outline the main differences in the behavior of such lasers compared to the previously studied class - a case as regards bistable lasing .",
    "we begin with a comparison of the laser classes in the near - threshold regime .",
    "as should be expected , the solutions for all classes display full coincidence if the class - a approximation @xmath240 holds ( note that this condition is rather restrictive in microlasers , requiring a careful choice of the gain medium as well as the cavity design ) .",
    "the mode dynamics @xmath91 start to exhibit differences whenever @xmath16  or  @xmath137 are increased out of the class - a approximation . the differences , however , are relatively minor , manifesting themselves mainly in the character of the transition process . in most cases ,",
    "the mode coupling constant  @xmath146 as defined for the class - a in eqs .",
    " continues to predict the laser dynamics correctly ( @xmath142 : simultaneous lasing , @xmath143 : bistability ) even outside its strict range of applicability , although the behavior of  @xmath91 can be quite different during the transition period .    as discussed above , the class - b equations ",
    "do not involve a near - threshold approximation , it becomes possible to consider a greater range of pumping rates , including regimes far above threshold , which are often left out of the picture in a construction of a multimode laser model @xcite .",
    "comparison of the numerical results for class - b vs.  class - c equations show that as long as the class - b prerequisites @xmath61 hold , the results are similar , unless the condition @xmath63 is violated .",
    "this agrees well with the earlier discussions in section  [ sub : eqs - b ] .",
    "the differences appear not to be qualitative , but quantitative only , manifesting in the exact shape of the @xmath241 dependence .",
    "the overall outcome of the mode interaction largely remains the same .",
    "to summarize , the main effect of the class - a to class - b transition in the context of studying bistable lasing is the inclusion of larger pumping rates  @xmath13 , while the main effect of the class - b to class - c transition is the inclusion of larger frequency mode separations  @xmath1 .",
    "the increase of the pumping rate in a class - b laser is known to change the saturation character of the mode amplitudes .",
    "the non - instantaneous relaxation of the population inversion with respect to the cavity field gives rise to spiking ( for smaller  @xmath13 ) or relaxation oscillations ( for greater  @xmath13 ) in the dependence @xmath91 .",
    "a still stronger pumping ( several orders of magnitude above threshold ) causes the oscillations to vanish , as reported in an earlier work @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , an increase of  @xmath13 can restore bistable lasing in the cases when simultaneous lasing is observed just above threshold .",
    "[ fig : graph_c ] suggests that there should be no bistability in the area around @xmath242 .",
    "the numerical solution of the class - c equations shows that this is indeed the case for smaller  @xmath13 .",
    "however , if the pumping is increased beyond a certain critical value  @xmath243 , a transition from simultaneous to bistable lasing occurs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : class_c ] ) .",
    "this effect was reported earlier @xcite with the observation that bistability ensues when pumping becomes so large that relaxation oscillations disappear .",
    "our further investigations have revealed that this observation was rather a coincidence , and @xmath243  scales with  @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : class_c ] ) , bifurcating from threshold at approximately the point where @xmath155 according to eq .  .",
    "this falls in line with the result of the previous section that a stronger pumping is capable of restoring bistability where it has been deteriorated by adverse effects of insufficient mode matching .     and intermode frequency separation  @xmath1 in a class - c laser model .",
    "the parameters are @xmath244 and @xmath245 , as used for numerical simulation in @xcite .",
    "the density plot shows the quantity @xmath246 for large @xmath247 .",
    "near - zero ( light ) values indicate two - mode ( simultaneous ) lasing while near - unity ( dark ) values indicate one - mode ( bistable ) lasing .",
    "the lasing threshold depending on  @xmath1 is marked with the dotted line .",
    "numerical results of the fdtd simulations for coupled - defect structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fdtd_structure ] ) are superimposed over the density plot .",
    "circles ( red ) and squares ( yellow ) show the location of points where simultaneous and bistable lasing , respectively , was observed in the mode dynamics during simulations . [",
    "fig : class_c ] ]     can be changed .",
    "[ fig : fdtd_structure ] ]    because applicability of the expansion and sometimes even of the svea @xcite may become questionable far above threshold , we have carried out a comparison of class - b / c results with direct numerical simulations .",
    "as previously described in ref .",
    "@xcite , a space - time fdtd solver was coupled to the four - level laser rate equations in order to model the response of a laser medium . a 2d photonic crystal lattice with two coupled defects @xcite was used as a model system ( fig .  [ fig : fdtd_structure ] ) .",
    "both defects are filled with four - level gain medium and contain a dipole source in the centre . by exciting these sources with varying amplitude / phase relations ,",
    "the two modes ( symmetric and antisymmetric @xcite ) can be excited in any proportion and thus the initial state of the resonator can be controlled . by changing the number of lattice rows between the defects from 1 to 5 ,",
    "one can change  @xmath1 from  @xmath248 down to @xmath249 .",
    "the waveguides coupled to the defects form the primary channel for the radiation to leak out of the resonator .",
    "care was taken that the mode @xmath0-factors remain approximately the same across the whole family of structures .",
    "the results of the fdtd simulation runs are superimposed in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : class_c ] . for all values of  @xmath1",
    ", the transition between simultaneous and bistable lasing was found approximately around  @xmath243 as predicted by the analytical theory .",
    "for larger  @xmath1 the correspondence is better because smaller @xmath1  and  @xmath13 require much longer times to get to the steady state and there is an increased sensitivity to mode mismatch ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : i12_domain_r ] ) .",
    "hence it becomes more difficult to establish the transition point between simultaneous and bistable lasing with good accuracy .            in figs .",
    "[ fig : fdtd_2 ] and  [ fig : fdtd_4 ] , temporal laser dynamics in numerical simulations and the class - c model are compared .",
    "we analyze the electric field in the center of either defect  @xmath250 . for fdtd",
    ", it is monitored directly by recording the field at the corresponding point in space @xmath251 . to reduce the excessive amount of data , we sample the field only at the local maxima , so that an envelope over the light oscillations is plotted . in the case of the coupled mode theory , the same quantity",
    "is obtained from the mode amplitudes  @xmath25 using eq .   as @xmath252 where @xmath253 $ ] , assuming the modes are normalized according to eq .  .",
    "taking the absolute value , light oscillations are also neglected , so the results can be compared to the simulations .    in all examples of figs .",
    "[ fig : fdtd_2 ] ,  [ fig : fdtd_4 ] ( which correspond to the laser operating way above threshold ) , the field dynamics shows a good qualitative and quantitative correspondence .",
    "below  @xmath243 where simultaneous two - mode lasing is expected , the in - cavity field envelope shows the characteristic @xmath62 beat oscillations ( see the insets in figs .",
    "[ fig : fdtd_2][fig : fdtd_4 ] ) , marking the presence of both modes in the laser radiation . above  @xmath243 ,",
    "the steady - state envelope is flat , indicative of single - mode lasing , and the beat oscillations are seen to vanish .",
    "this corresponds to quenching of the weaker mode in agreement with theoretical expectations in the bistable regime .",
    "some quantitative discrepancies between the model and simulation results can be noticed . some of them ( e.g. , temporal shifts of the spikes in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdtd_4 ] ) result from minor deviations in parameters between the real simulated structure and an idealized two - mode system considered .",
    "these deviations can be compensated for by fine - tuning the model @xcite .",
    "other discrepancies such as the the difference in the field amplitudes ( both at spike maxima and in the steady - state ) can be attributed to gain saturation , which may introduce correction to the form of the expansion   for the gain medum polarization .",
    "this is a limitation inherent in the present coupled - mode model .",
    "however , eqs .   and",
    " are clearly seen to provide a valid description of laser mode dynamics scenario for relatively strong pumping , unlike the near - threshold ( third - order nonlinearity ) theories which are reported to fail badly in this regime ( see @xcite ) , just like the class - a equations would .",
    "one can overcome this limitation , e.g. , following the approach in refs .",
    "@xcite where a generalization of eqs .",
    " is introduced . a very good agreement with numerics",
    "is reported recently @xcite .",
    "however , only the time - independent ( steady - state ) theory is formulated so far .",
    "the knowledge that stronger pumping can restore a laser into the bistable regime for higher  @xmath1 is important in the design of a laser that can have its wavelength switched by a large value ( such as several tens of nanometers in refs .",
    "a rigorous explanation of this result is yet to be given .",
    "intuitively , stronger pumping rates cause shorter lasing onset times compared to the cavity round - trip time , so the domination of the stronger mode can occur before the modes have a chance to balance themselves through the cavity .",
    "indeed , it could be noticed that the transition from simultaneous to bistable lasing around  @xmath243 is accompanied by the disappearance of @xmath126-pulsations in the phase of some dynamical variables .",
    "this suggests that shorter onset due to stronger pumping allows some of the variables to become phase - locked , which in turn influences the whole character of the mode interaction ( as was seen when the transition from eq .",
    "was discussed ) .",
    "the detailed investigation of this effect is a subject for further studies .",
    "in this work , we have addressed the problem of bistability in a microlaser by systematically formulating the coupled - mode model without prior assumptions on the mode or cavity geometry , other than the requirement of the mode orthogonality in the cavity as well as in the gain region as described by eqs .   and  .",
    "the governing equations have been derived for all laser classes , eqs .",
    " ,  , and for class - c ,  b , and  a , respectively .",
    "the issue of classifying the laser dynamics in the multimode case has been revisited taking into account the intermode frequency separation  @xmath1 as a new parameter influencing the laser dynamics .",
    "the model has been derived for the case of two modes ; however , its extension to the case of several modes can be performed along the same lines .",
    "the simplest case of the class - a laser equations has been analytically investigated .",
    "it has been shown that coherent mode interaction processes ( population pulsations ) can provide an additional mode coupling channel besides incoherent mode interaction ( spatial hole burning ) .",
    "this additional coupling is what brings the laser into the bistable regime , allowing the lasing mode to be chosen on demand by the initial condition of the cavity .",
    "this result agrees with the early theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "however , microcavity modes can have a far better matched intensity distribution inside the gain region , see eq .",
    ", compared to bulk - cavity modes , which are usually heavily out of match unless  @xmath131 . as such , only a moderate amount of pulsation - induced mode coupling is enough to enter the bistability regime in the case of a microlaser .",
    "this means that microlasers can be bistable in a far greater parameter range than bulk - cavity lasers , e.g. , for much larger  @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : graph_c ] ) .",
    "we have also shown that a sizable mismatch in the system parameters that favors one of the modes can destroy any chance of bistable operation . however , a mismatch with respect to one parameter can be compensated for by a mismatch with respect to another ( fig .",
    "[ fig : i12_zero ] ) .",
    "again , due to better matched intensity distributions of microcavity modes the bistable regime is more tolerant to such perturbations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : i12_domain_c ] ) .    in the more general class - b or class - c laser models ,",
    "we have shown numerically that even when @xmath1  is too large to allow bistability in the near - threshold class - a case , it can be overcome by increasing the pumping rate ( fig .  [",
    "fig : class_c ] ) .",
    "the results of the theory are confirmed by direct numerical fdtd simulations and are shown to be qualitatively valid for pumping rates several orders of magnitudes above the lasing threshold .",
    "further results on bistability in class - b / c microlasers will be available in a forthcoming publication",
    ".    bistable operation of a multimode microlaser can be useful in many respects .",
    "since there is no need for an external ( and potentially slow ) cavity - tuning process , ultrafast all - optical mode switching mechanisms can be imagined .",
    "such switching , occurring across @xmath254  nm on a picosecond time scale had indeed been demonstrated numerically in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the fast switching between stable states and the relatively low power of microlasers can be used in the design of an optical memory ( flip - flop ) cell .",
    "we believe , that a compact - sized microlaser capable of multiple - wavelength operation in a wide wavelength range can find numerous applications in integrated optics and optical communication .",
