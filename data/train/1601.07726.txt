    "feshbach resonance @xcite exists in many kinds of ultracold gases , and can be used as a power tool for controlling the interaction between ultracold atoms @xcite . for instance , in the ultracold gases of alkali atoms , when the relative motional state of two atoms in the open channel ( oc ) is near resonant to a bound state of the closed channel ( cc ) with higher threshold energy , magnetic feshbach resonance ( mfr ) can be induced by the hyperfine coupling between different channels @xcite . with the help of this resonance effect , one can precisely control the scattering length between these two atoms by magnetically changing the inter - channel energy difference . in almost all the current experiments of ultracold alkali atoms ,",
    "when the mfr appears , the gap between the threshold energies of the oc and the cc is as high as @xmath1hz@xmath2hz @xcite . as a result of this large energy gap , the resonance is usually induced by the coupling between the oc and a single bound state ( or several bound states with similar energies ) of the cc . the contribution of the scattering states of the cc for the resonance can be neglected .    for ultracold alkali - earth ( like ) atoms , recently we proposed a new type of feshbach resonance , i.e. , orbital feshbach resonance ( ofr ) @xcite .",
    "this resonance can occur in the scattering between two alkali - earth ( like ) atoms in different electronic orbital and nuclear spin states .",
    "the ofr is a result of the spin - exchange interaction @xcite and the zeeman effect @xcite in such system , and can be used for magnetically controlling the interaction between alkali - earth ( like ) atoms .",
    "the ofr has been experimentally observed in ultracold @xmath3 atoms which are in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 electronic orbital states with different quantum numbers of nuclear spins @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "when the ofr occurs , the energy gap between the thresholds of the cc and the oc is about @xmath6hz @xcite .",
    "this energy gap is not only much smaller than the cc - oc threshold gap of the mfr of ultracold alkali atoms , but also much smaller than the characteristic energy ( i.e. , the van der waals energy ) of the interaction potential between these @xmath3 atoms , which is about @xmath7hz @xcite .",
    "this paper is to address the effect of this small energy gap in ofr .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * for the systems with small cc - oc threshold gap , the effects contributed by the scattering states of the cc may be very important . as a result",
    ", the ofr can be induced by the coupling of either of the following two types : * * the coupling between the oc and an isolated bound state of the cc . * * the coupling between the oc and the scattering states of the cc @xcite . * in each of the above cases , the two - channel huang - yang pseudopotential @xcite ( i.e. , the pseudopotential used in our previous work @xcite ) is always applicable for the approximate calculation of the low - energy scattering amplitude .",

    "<S> recently a new type of feshbach resonance , i.e. , orbital feshbach resonance ( ofr ) was proposed for the ultracold alkali - earth ( like ) atoms , and experimentally observed in the ultracold gases of @xmath0yb atoms . unlike most of the magnetic feshbach resonances of ultracold alkali atoms , </S>",
    "<S> when the ofr of @xmath0yb atoms appears , the energy gap between the thresholds of the open channel ( oc ) and the closed channel ( cc ) is much smaller than the characteristic energy of the inter - atomic interaction , i.e. , the van der waals energy . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the ofr in the systems with small cc - oc threshold gap . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in these systems the ofr can be induced by the coupling between the oc and either an isolated bound state of the cc or the scattering states of the cc . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we also show that in each case the two - channel huang - yang pesudopoential is always applicable for the approximate calculation of the low - energy scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that in the theoretical calculations for these systems it is appropriate to take into account the contributions from the scattering states of the cc . </S>"
