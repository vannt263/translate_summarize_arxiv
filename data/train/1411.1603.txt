    "a good fraction of core - collapse supernovae  ( sne ) has bright radio counterparts called radio sne .",
    "the radio emission is due to the synchrotron emission from non - thermal electrons accelerated at the shock with a velocity of @xmath4  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such fast - moving ejecta are formed when sn shocks break out of the progenitor stars  @xcite",
    ". therefore , radio sne are good probes of the dynamics of the sn ejecta , the progenitor structure , and the circumstellar medium  ( csm ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "intrinsically much brighter radio counterparts have been observed in several broad - lined type ibc sne  ( sne ibc ) or hypernovae  ( hne ) .",
    "previous authors claimed that these radio emissions are too bright to be powered by the ejecta produced by sn / hn shock breakout so that additional trans - relativistic components are required  @xcite .",
    "they proposed that relativistic jets which barely punch out the progenitor stars are the origins of the trans - relativistic components  @xcite .",
    "in fact , some of these radio - bright hne are associated with low - luminosity gamma - ray bursts  ( llgrbs ) , while others , like sn 2009bb and sn 2012ap , did not show detectable high - energy emission .",
    "the latter events are called relativistic sne .",
    "to clarify the above arguments , in figure [ fig : ene_dist ] , we show the energy profile of sn / hn ejecta as a function of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the energy profiles of a normal sn ibc  ( black ) and an hn  ( sn 2009bb ; blue ) , which are theoretically predicted from spherical explosions  @xcite . on the other hand , the yellow point on the dashed line",
    "was obtained by @xcite to explain the bright radio counterpart of sn 2009bb .",
    "as one can see , there is a significant gap between the blue line and the yellow point on the dashed line .",
    "this is the reason why the previous authors introduced an additional trans - relativistic component driven by a relativistic jet  ( the dashed line ) .",
    "if this is the case , then radio - bright hne may be a missing link between ordinary sne ibc and hne associated with grbs .    in this paper ,",
    "however , we show that the previous studies overestimated the energy and the speed of the trans - relativistic ejecta . in section [ sec : rsm ] , we describe the refreshed shock model of a spherical sn / hn ejecta . this model is used to calculate the emission from a radio - bright hn in section [ sec : result ] . in section",

    "such optical precursors can be detected using current and future sn surveys and provide further insight into the explosion mechanism of hne and the circumstellar environments . in particular , the detection of an optical precursor can be crucial to distinguish between our model and the previous one . in section [ subsec : parameter ]",

    "a small fraction of the surface layer can be accelerated up to trans - relativistic velocities , @xmath11 .",

    "<S> we examine the bright radio synchrotron counterparts of low - luminosity gamma - ray bursts  ( llgrbs ) and relativistic supernovae  ( sne ) and find that they can be powered by spherical hypernova  ( hn ) explosions . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that radio - bright hne are driven by relativistic jets that are choked deep inside the progenitor stars or quasi - spherical magnetized winds from fast - rotating magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the optical synchrotron counterparts of radio - bright hne and show that they can be observed as precursors several days before the sn peak with an @xmath0-band absolute magnitude of @xmath1 mag . </S>",
    "<S> while previous studies suggested that additional trans - relativistic components are required to power the bright radio emission , we find that they overestimated the energy budget of the trans - relativistic component by overlooking some factors related to the minimum energy of non - thermal electrons . </S>",
    "<S> if an additional trans - relativistic component exists , then a much brighter optical precursor with @xmath2 mag can be expected . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the scenarios of radio - bright hne can be distinguished by using optical precursors , which can be detectable from @xmath3 by current sn surveys like the kiso sn survey , palomar transient factory , and panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system . </S>"
