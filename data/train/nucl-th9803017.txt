    "<S> -0.35 in 0.00 in 0.25 in 6.50 in 8.5 in    [ [ section ] ]    recent measurements of the flavor @xcite and spin @xcite dependence of quark distributions in the nucleon have led to a revival of interest in the soft qcd physics that determines the shape and normalization of parton distributions @xcite , and has led to a re - examination of some of the fundamental assumptions embodied in the parametrizations @xcite used to describe data from high energy experiments . in particular , the violation of charge symmetry in the valence quark distributions has been calculated by a number of authors @xcite in the context of quark models , and surprisingly large violations , as large as 5 - 10% , have been found at large @xmath0 @xcite . although charge symmetry is assumed in all phenomenological parton distributions , there is not a great deal of direct experimental evidence which justifies this assumption . the strongest upper limit on parton charge symmetry violation(csv ) can be obtained by comparing the @xmath1 structure function for charged lepton deep inelastic scattering with the @xmath1 structure function measured in neutrino - induced charged current reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the ccfr group has recently carried out such a test using the most recent available data @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , we use these results to examine the changes in the valence quark distribution due to su(4 ) violation via color magnetism , and charge symmetry violation via quark masses and electro - magnetism . combining these results </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a wavefunction independent prediction relating the dominant contribution to the csv valence distribution to the well known difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 valence distributions . in the penultimate section , </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the charge symmetry violating sea quark distributions , assuming that the dominant csv effect comes from the mass and electro - magnetic differences of the participating quarks , rather than from dependence of the quark wavefunctions on charge symmetry , as is the case for the valence quark csv contributions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> finally , we compare our results with those of other authors and discuss their implications .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]    for the purposes of this paper , we shall adopt the adelaide method for calculating quark distributions from model wavefunctions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point for the method is the reduction of quark distributions to the form @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath3 is the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath8 is the mass of the target , @xmath9 is the light cone wavefunction for the struck quark in momentum space , and @xmath10 is the energy of the struck quark . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous expression gives the antiquark distributions @xmath11    the essence of the adelaide approach lies in the kinematic assumption that the three quark system can be divided into the struck quark plus a diquark spectator system , and that the distribution of masses of the spectator system is sufficiently sharply peaked that the diquark can be thought of as an on - shell system with a definite mass . </S>",
    "<S> this completely specifies the kinematics of the problem and allows the quark energy appearing in the delta functions of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ one ] and [ two ] to be replaced by the difference between the target mass and the on - shell diquark energy . </S>",
    "<S> since the direct calculation of these distributions is not our interest here , we will not reduce this expression further , but simply note that the expression for the quark distribution can be reduced to a single integral over the momentum space wavefunction of the struck quark @xcite , and is guaranteed to have the correct support as a function of @xmath0 regardless of the properties of the wavefunctions used to evaluate the integral .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-2 ] ]    with the exception of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the approach to study the violation of parton distribution symmetries has been to calculate entire distributions in the framework of a given quark model and then to compare the results from small variations in the model parameters . in refs . @xcite and @xcite , the dependence of the valence quark distribution on the model wavefunction and diquark </S>",

    "<S> these relations , which relate distributions with different flavors within the same hadron , are somewhat inappropriately termed flavor symmetries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such symmetries are a consequence of dynamical assumptions about the nature of confinement in qcd . in this instance , the quark model su(4 ) spin - isospin symmetry gets broken by the color hyperfine interaction , leading to the well - known dominance of @xmath26 over @xmath27 at large @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry breaking has been modeled by close and thomas @xcite , who considered the spin - flavor correlations in the su(4 ) nucleon wavefunction and the mass splitting of spin 1 and spin 0 diquark pairs brought about by the color hyperfine interaction . in this picture , </S>",
    "<S> the valence distribution depends not on the flavor of the struck quark , but rather on the spin of the spectator diquark system . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , @xmath28 where the superscript refers to the spin of the diquark spectator . in the su(4 ) symmetric limit , @xmath29 and eq .  [ five ] is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> color hyperfine effects are included via a hamiltonian of the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 the spin of quark @xmath32 , @xmath33 the corresponding color generator , and @xmath34 mev is normalized by the @xmath35 splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the diquark masses are shifted according to @xmath36 so that , from eq .  [ dqanal ] , @xmath37 and @xmath38 interestingly </S>",
    "<S> , this pattern of symmetry breaking predicts that the valence distributions measured in lepto - production from neutron targets are precisely the su(4 ) symmetric distributions .    </S>",

    "<S> charge symmetry is violated by quark mass and electro - magnetic effects and is generally expected at the level of one per cent . </S>",
    "<S> since both of these effects are iso - vector , there is no csv contribution to the mass of the isoscalar diquark , and we may write , for the majority quark distributions , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the change in the quark distribution generated by the shift in the @xmath44 diquark masses via eq .   </S>",
    "<S> [ dqanal ] . since the only difference between the csv case and the flavor / su(4 ) symmetry violating distribution is the value of @xmath14 , the two distributions are the same up to a normalization , so that @xmath45    from the bag model , a robust estimate of the isovector diquark mass splitting is -4 mev @xcite , yielding @xmath46 . using the cteq4 lq distributions @xcite to parametrize the valence distributions , </S>",

    "<S> [ analyt ] and the two different model calculations of csv gives us confidence that the model calculations give rather robust predictions of valence quark charge symmetry violation .    to complete the calculation of the csv distributions we must include the effect of the proton - neutron mass difference </S>",
    "<S> this proceeds in essentially the same manner outlined in the last section , with the slight subtlety that the variation with respect to the target mass should be taken keeping the product @xmath48 fixed , as the mass is implicit in the definition of @xmath3 ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an explanation of this point ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting addition to the csv distribution yields @xmath49 where @xmath50 mev is the proton - neutron mass difference.the resulting csv distributions ( multiplied by @xmath3 ) are shown in fig . 2 for the cteq4 lq distributions , along with the csv contribution to the minority quark distribution ( @xmath51 ) from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( the dash - dot curve in fig .  2 ) .    as a consequence of the singularities in the cteq parametrizations , </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon mass correction diverges non - integrably at @xmath52 , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> eq .   [ dqanal ] . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the inadequacy of the diquark spectator approximation in this region , which is dominated by states having one or more pairs of sea quarks . at larger @xmath3 , where the calculation is more reliable , </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon mass correction partially cancels out the change due to the diquark mass shift , a result which can be expected on the basis of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ three ] . in accordance with the results of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the magnitude of the csv contribution to the minority and majority quark distributions are roughly comparable , so that the smaller minority quark distribution is more sensitive to charge symmetry violation than the majority distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-4 ] ]    there has been much interest in the question of flavor symmetry violation in the nucleon sea , following the precise measurement of the gottfried sum rule @xcite by the nmc group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gottfried sum rule is obtained by integrating the @xmath1 structure functions for lepton - induced deep inelastic scattering(dis ) on protons and neutrons , @xmath53 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { 1\\over 3 } + { 8\\over 9 } \\left ( p_{\\bar{u}/p }     - p_{\\bar{u}/n } \\right ) + { 2\\over 9 } \\left ( p_{\\bar{d}/p }   -     p_{\\bar{d}/n } \\right ) ~~ ,   \\label{gottf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define the sea quark probabilities as @xmath54 in deriving eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gottf ] we have used the normalization of the valence quark distributions ; if we assume parton charge symmetry we obtain the `` standard '' form for the gottfried sum rule , @xmath55    by measurements over the range @xmath56 for muon dis on proton and deuteron targets , and extrapolation over the unmeasured region , the nmc group obtained @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> if one assumes charge symmetry , this result implies an asymmetry in the probabilities for finding up and down sea quarks in the proton , @xmath58 however , as was pointed out by ma @xcite , we could alternatively assume flavor symmetry but not charge symmetry for the sea quark distributions , in which case the nmc result would imply @xmath59 experimental upper limits on sea quark charge symmetry can not at present rule out parton csv contributions . </S>",
    "<S> so it is possible that the gottfried sum rule result arises either from csv effects , or from a combination of flavor symmetry and charge symmetry violation .    in this section </S>",
    "<S> we will estimate the magnitude of charge symmetry violation for sea quarks , and the contribution this might make to the gottfried sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of flavor symmetry or charge symmetry violation on the sea quark distributions is complicated by the fact that there are no sum rules constraining the normalization of the sea quark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in the standard parametrizations @xcite at high momentum scales the total number of sea quarks is infinite , a fact that has been used to suggest that fractionally small csv in the sea may lead to sizeable contributions to the gottfried sum rule @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since this contribution , regardless of its source , is independent of the momentum scale at which it is measured @xcite , it is amenable to modeling at a relatively low scale , say @xmath60 gev@xmath61 , where it has been argued that the number of sea quarks in the nucleon is finite @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-5 ] ]    the csv contributions to the sea separate , somewhat artificially , into two classes : strong csv effects which change the number of sea quarks in the nucleon ( and potentially contribute to the gottfried sum rule ) , and weak csv effects which change the shape of the sea distributions without altering their normalization . </S>",
    "<S> we shall begin by considering the first of these classes , since the extent to which the gottfried sum rule violation is a reflection of csv rather than flavor symmetry violation may provide an important constraint on the second class of csv contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest perturbative estimate of the size of the csv contribution is obtained by modeling the nucleon as a valence state coupled to a small number of states with an additional quark - antiquark pair @xmath62 with @xmath63 a normalization , @xmath64 the amplitude for finding the `` extra '' quark anti - quark pair of flavor @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is a three quark state with the same third component of isospin as the original three quark state . assuming flavor symmetry , the amplitude for creating an extra quark pair of flavor @xmath67 is given , in perturbation theory , by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mass of the 4 quark , anti - quark state , and @xmath70 is a typical hadronic mass scale determined by the strong coupling constant and the details of the wavefunction.if charge symmetry is also good , this amplitude is independent of the flavor of the quark - antiquark pair , so that the probability for creating a quark anti - quark pair of flavor @xmath67 is @xmath71 which , apart from pauli effects which violate the flavor symmetry we ve assumed , is essentially the result of donoghue and golowich @xcite .    to incorporate charge symmetry violation into this picture requires only an estimate of the mass shift due to quark mass and electro - magnetic effects . </S>",
    "<S> we parametrize this difference via a term that counts the number of up and down quark masses in the composite system , and through the inclusion of an electro - magnetic contribution to the energy which we assume is proportional to the sum of the pairwise products of the charges of the constituents . the quark mass difference and electro - magnetic energy </S>",
    "<S> are then fit to the mass shifts of the diquark and nucleon , and the results are extrapolated to systems with more quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure clearly neglects a great deal of the physics of these systems , but should be sufficient to provide an estimate of the energy scales involved.the resulting mass shifts between charge conjugate systems can then be written @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of quarks plus antiquarks of flavor @xmath74 in the system in question , @xmath75 is the change in the sum of the products of charges under charge conjugation , and @xmath76 is the average electro - magnetic energy of each quark pair . the mass shifts that result from this procedure are shown in table 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> expanding to first order in the symmetry violating terms yields relations between the number of sea quarks of charge conjugate flavors in the proton and neutron : @xmath77 where @xmath78 mev is the constituent quark mass in the symmetric limit . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , since the energy required to make a pair of a particular flavor is the same for both the proton and neutron in this parametrization , there is no contribution to the gottfried sum rule in the flavor symmetric limit . in a more sophisticated treatment of quark mass and electro - magnetic effects </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the csv contribution will be non - zero , but since a contribution to the gottfried sum rule needs top be odd under the combined operation of flavor and charge symmetry , which requires additional csv and flavor violating effects , the csv contribution to the gottfried sum rule will be suppressed below the natural scales for csv effects arising from quark mass differences and electromagnetic terms ( proportional to @xmath79 and @xmath67 , respectively ) .    </S>",
    "<S> another source for csv in the sea is the possibility of charge dependence of the quark gluon coupling constant . by dressing the quark - gluon vertex with a photon as in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3a and 3b , the effective quark - gluon coupling for @xmath5 quarks is different than that for @xmath6 quarks @xcite , so that the probability of creating a @xmath80 pair becomes dependent on both the flavor of the pair created and the flavor of the quark that emitted the gluon .    at low momentum scales , the effective gluon coupling to a quark of flavor @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath83,@xmath84 is the quark charge , and @xmath85 with @xmath67 the electro - magnetic coupling . rewriting this , </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath86 where now @xmath87 is the charge asymmetric piece of the strong coupling and @xmath88 .    assuming that the sea quarks at low momentum scales are generated by the valence quarks </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath89 from which we obtain , to first order in the csv terms , @xmath90    since the valence quarks provide a source of flavor asymmetry , there is a contribution to the gottfried sum rule . using the cteq distributions to calculate @xmath91 and @xmath92 mev , we find the csv contribution to the gottfried sum rule to be @xmath93 , which is far too small to explain the observed deviation . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , there is a small excess of strange quarks in the proton over those in the neutron , according to @xmath94    having eliminated the possibility of a large csv contribution to the gottfried sum rule , we return briefly to the possibility that the largest part of the sum rule comes from violation of flavor symmetry , and that the violation of flavor symmetry leads to a csv contribution to the sum as well . combining eq .  [ conjg ] with a flavor asymmetric sea yields @xmath95 using the cteq parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> our estimated csv contribution is still far too small to affect significantly the extraction of the flavor asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the prospects for a large contribution to the gottfried sum rule from sea quark csv are extremely slim , at least within the assumptions in our calculation of charge symmetry violating effects .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-6 ] ]    since we have been unable to produce a mechanism for generating a csv distribution whose integral is significantly different from zero , we are led to investigate the possibility of weak charge symmetry breaking , where the shapes of the sea distributions in the neutron and proton are different , but their normalizations remain the same . by analogy with the csv effects in the valence distributions </S>",
    "<S> , we shall proceed by postulating that the 4 spectator partons can be assumed to belong to a tetra - quark , and that the mass of the recoiling tetra - quark can be assumed to be approximately constant with a value roughly equal to the sum of the constituent quark masses . since there is a greater variety of states available to the four parton spectator system , </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is much less certain than the analogous assumption in the valence case , but it will allow for an exploration of the magnitudes involved in the problem .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic argument proceeds as in the case of the valence distributions , by calculating the shift in the tetra - quark mass produced by the symmetry violating interactions and expanding to get    @xmath96,\\ ] ]    where @xmath97 is the charge symmetric tetra - quark mass , and @xmath98 is the anti - quark distribution in the symmetric limit . for the light quark sea , </S>",
    "<S> we have used a tetra - quark mass of @xmath99 mev , roughly four times the constituent quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> if , as many models assert , pionic effects dominate the sea at these low scales , this assumption will underestimate the size of the csv contribution to the light quark sea . for the systems containing strange quarks , we have assumed a constituent quark mass of 500 mev . in addition to this correction , there will be a correction due the change in the nucleon mass introduced by csv , which is calculated in the same fashion as the analogous contribution for the valence quarks.the values of the csv induced mass shifts for strange and nonstrange tetra - quarks are listed in table 1 , and the resulting csv sea distributions are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .    just as in the case of the valence distributions , the large contribution to sea quark asymmetries at very small @xmath3 is a consequence of the singular form of the parton distributions in this region , and indicates the breakdown of the tetra - quark picture we ve used here . at larger @xmath3 , the relative size of @xmath100 over @xmath101 reflects the fact that the tetra - quark spectator has @xmath102 when a @xmath103 is struck , so that there is no tetra - quark mass shift to partially cancel the nucleon mass shift , as is the case when @xmath104 is struck . for the strange csv distributions , </S>",
    "<S> a similar cancellation occurs for the spectator tetra - quark when an @xmath105 quark is struck , but since this cancellation depends sensitively on the parameters chosen in table 1 , we conclude this result may be highly model dependent and therefore untrustworthy . in general , we do not find surprisingly large contributions for any of the sea quark distributions . </S>"
