    "the hipparcos mission was highly successful in providing parallaxes and proper motions , but right from the beginning of the project it was realised that the lack of matching radial velocities seriously hampered the study of galactic structure and dynamics .",
    "unfortunately the proposals to build dedicated ground based telescopes for the radial velocity measurements were not financed .",
    "long term programmes on existing facilities have strived to obtain the radial velocities ( fehrenbach et al . @xcite and references therein , grenier et al .",
    "@xcite , nordstrm et al .",
    "@xcite ) , however a compilation of these and other sources , only amounts to radial velocities for 35495 stars ( gontcharov @xcite ) , which represents 30% of the hipparcos catalogue .    building upon this experience , from the beginning of the study of gaia",
    "it was planned that it should include an instrument capable of measuring radial velocities .",
    "since to measure a radial velocity one needs a spectrum , there is a lot more information than radial velocity that can be be extracted from a spectrum : effective temperatures , surface gravities , chemical abundances and rotational velocities .",
    "the clever phase a design of the radial velocity spectrometer ( rvs , katz et al .",
    "@xcite ) allowed to obtain this and provide spectroscopic information essentially for all stars down to magnitude 17.5 ( wilkinson et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as the design of gaia became more detailed in phases b and c , the performances of the rvs degraded significantly as a result of the result of the trade - offs made by the industrial consortium astrium and esa .    under these conditions",
    "it is of high interest to perform ground - based observations which may complement the informations provided by gaia , at least for a limited sample of stars . with this in mind we started a study for a high resolution multi - fibre spectrograph , to be placed at the prime focus of the canada - france - hawaii telescope . in this respect",
    ", gyes is truly a son of gaia .",
    "gyes aims at providing radial velocities and chemical abundances for all of the galactic populations ( thin , thick disks , bulge , halo , open and globular clusters ) .",
    "the main emphasis is on the `` chemical labelling '' , whereby we wish to measure chemical abundances with an accuracy of the order of 0.1dex , looking for the characteristic patterns which allow to separate the various populations .",
    "the radial velocities accuracy ought to match that provided by gaia for the the transverse velocities , about 1@xmath0 .",
    "we are preparing a survey strategy document , which concretely illustrates how gyes can be used to conduct the desired survey .",
    "we target a survey of 50 nights / year over 5 years to cover a total of more than 800 fields .",
    "main targets will be f  g dwarfs and subgiants for which we will be able to derive ages using the distances provided by gaia , and giant stars to study the gradients at larger distances .",
    "the need for accurate abundances for several elements , drives the request on resolution which should not be lower than 15000 and , if possible , as high as 30000 .",
    "a baseline has been established starting from the science requirements and making a number of trade - offs to ensure : _",
    "i ) _ maximum efficiency ; _ ii ) _ hardware cost within an envelope of 5 m ; _ iii ) _ simplicity and robustness . for the field",
    "corrector the baseline is to use the triplet , built by reosc , that was previously used for direct imaging at the prime focus with photographic plates and also with the electronic camera .",
    "the unvignetted field - of - view has a diameter of 0.86@xmath1 , it is however possible to use a field - of - view of 1.00@xmath1 , in which the vignetting leads to a loss of only 5% of light on the outer ring .",
    "the fibre positioner unit resembles that of 2df , consisting of two plates ( with associated sets of fibres ) which can be exchanged by tumbling , orthogonally to the telescope s axis .",
    "the positioning is performed on the top plate , while the bottom plate is observing , by a commercial off - the - shelf @xmath2 robot .",
    "the field - corrector and positioner are supported by a dedicated upper end which , when not in use , can be parked on the floor of the dome , as is currently done with the three upper ends in use at cfht ( secondary mirror for cassegrain instruments , megaprime - megacam , and wircam ) .",
    "experiments with the positioning software of 2df allowed to conclude that it is possible to position 500 fibres in the available one degree field .",
    "the fibres are collected into a single fibre bundle that links the focal plane to the slit of spectrograph .",
    "two identical slits are foreseen , one for each observing plate , like for giraffe , and a slit - exchange mechanism .",
    "the fibre aperture on the sky will be a micro - lens of 1 diameter .",
    "this diameter allows to collect over 90% of the light for a typical seeing of 0 , taking into account also image quality provided by the field corrector .",
    "the spectrograph itself is placed in a thermally controlled room on the floor of the dome .",
    "an actual experiment performed at cfht , of the manoeuvre necessary to unmount the gyes upper end , with a rope instead of the fibre bundle , allowed to conclude that the manoeuvre is itself feasible , without breaking the fibre link and that the length of the fibres , including the necessary slack , is about 50 m .    at the exit of the slit",
    "the beam is collimated and split in two by a dichroic which delivers a blue and a red beam .",
    "the two arms of the spectrograph ( blue and red ) have a very similar optical design .",
    "the dispersing element is a pair of volume phase holographic ( vph ) gratings , used at moderate angles ( around 36@xmath1 ) , in a configuration similar to that suggested for the first time by span and bonifacio ( @xcite , but see also epps et al .",
    "the advantage of this solution , over that of using a single vph grating at higher incidence angles , is that one can obtain a very high efficiency together with a very large spectral range .",
    "the dispersed beam is focused by a fully dioptric camera , at the focal plane of which is a mosaic of two 4k@xmath34k ccds , the baseline is e2v ccd231 - 84 detectors , available off - the - shelf .",
    "this configuration allows to cover the ranges 390 - 450 nm in the blue arm and 587 - 673 nm in the red .",
    "each arm has a wavelength gap smaller than 3 nm due to the gap between the ccds .",
    "one disadvantage of this optical design is that the resolution varies continuously across the range , it is roughly 16000 at the blue end of each range and 30000 at the red end .",
    "this is undoubtedly a complication in the interpretation of the data , however simulations indicate that , as long as the resolution as a function of wavelength is well known , this is not a major problem .",
    "at the time of writing the estimates of costs and efficiency for gyes are not yet consolidated .",
    "it nevertheless appears likely that the instrument can be built within an envelope of hardware cost of 5 m. the progress of the project and updated information can be found on its web site http://gyes.obspm.fr ."
