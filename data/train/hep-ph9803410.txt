    "the search for a light higgs boson and the study of gauge boson pair production  @xcite are important physics goals of the lep2 upgrade at cern .",
    "if kinematically accessible to lep2 , the higgs boson will be primarily produced via the bjorken process @xmath3@xcite .",
    "an irreducible physics background to this processes is the production of @xmath4 boson pairs , which is most troublesome when @xmath5 .",
    "the clear separation of these two processes is required for a convincing higgs boson discovery or lower bound mass limit .",
    "kinematics as well as characteristic angular correlations will be useful in this separation .",
    "the study of @xmath1 boson pair production is also interesting in its own right@xcite , as it involves vertices coupling three gauge bosons ( especially @xmath6 ) , vertices which to date are poorly - probed experimentally .",
    "these couplings may be probed with varying degrees of sophistication by testing the predictions for the total cross section , production angle distribution , and correlations among the vector boson decay products .",
    "hence for all of these processes , @xmath0 and @xmath7 , we are keenly interested in the angular correlations among the final state particles . to disentangle these correlations",
    "it is very useful to understand the spin correlations of the heavy particles produced .",
    "these spin correlations as well as the subsequent correlations of the decay products are the focus of this paper .    until recently",
    ", most spin - related studies were carried out within the framework provided by the zero momentum frame helicity basis ( see , for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for particles which are ultra - relativistic , such as at the next generation of linear colliders , this is appropriate .",
    "however , for particles which are only moderately relativistic , there is no reason to expect that the helicity basis will produce the best description of the physics involved .",
    "indeed , for the case of @xmath8 production at low energy @xmath9 and @xmath10 colliders , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the helicity basis is far from optimal . in this paper we use the generalized spin basis introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 production and decay at lep2 energies .",
    "in particular , we write the polarized production amplitudes in terms of the most general @xmath14-conserving choice of spin axes , and from these expressions determine the choice of axes which leads to the most distinctive correlations among the final state particles .",
    "we argue that it is advantageous at lep2 energies to tune the choice of spin axis to the experimental issue being investigated , rather than to simply use the helicity basis and try to unravel the contributions from what are in many cases nearly - equally populated spin states .    for all three processes ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath7 , much effort in the literature has been devoted to the analysis of various anomalous trilinear couplings@xcite , employing , of course , the helicity basis . rather than attempt to rework all of those studies in terms of the generalized spin - basis , we have chosen to concentrate on the picture within the standard model .",
    "it is clear from our results , however , that such a study would be worthwhile , as we expect different spin bases to be optimal for the extraction / limitation of different anomalous couplings .",
    "such an analysis would be a major extension of this work .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . after a brief discussion of our notation and conventions in sec .",

    ", we consider in detail the polarized production cross sections , and construct spin bases suggested by the expressions for the amplitudes .",
    "we consider the decay of polarized @xmath4 s , and then link the production and decay to study the correlations among the decay products .",
    "we are able to construct a basis in which these correlations differ significantly for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 cases , whereas in the helicity basis the correlations are virtually non - existent . sec .",

    "to describe the polarized production cross sections for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 discussed in this paper , we employ the generic spin basis introduced by parke and shadmi in ref .",

    "[ xidef ] . for @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "this is the most general basis which conserves @xmath14 .",
    "we label the two particles produced in the collision by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the zero momentum frame ( zmf ) production angle @xmath19 is defined as the angle between the electron and @xmath17 directions .",
    "the spin states for the first particle are defined in the its rest frame , where we decompose the @xmath17 spin along the direction @xmath20 , which makes an angle @xmath21 with the @xmath18 momentum in the clockwise direction .",
    "likewise , the @xmath18 spin states are defined in its rest frame along the direction @xmath22 , which makes the _ same _  angle @xmath21 with the @xmath17 momentum , also in the clockwise direction .",
    "we denote the two transverse polarization states by @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the  state by 0 . throughout this paper",
    "we use the terms `` transverse '' and `` longitudinal '' to refer to directions relative to the spin axis , _ not _  the direction of motion of the particle .",
    "a generic vector boson spin will be designated by @xmath25 .",
    "if we sum over all of the polarizations of the vector boson(s ) , then the dependence on @xmath21 drops out of the result .    note",
    "that although the higgs boson is a scalar , we may still define a spin axis for it as if it were a vector .",
    "the spin zero character of the higgs will be reflected in a lack of any dependence on the choice of this axis .    within the generic spin basis framework ,",
    "specific spin bases are defined by stating the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath19 ( and any other relevant event parameters ) .",
    "for example , the ubiquitous helicity basis is defined by fixing .",
    "[ helicitydef ] in this case , the spins are defined along the directions of motion of the particles as seen in the zmf .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath17 and @xmath18 have identical mass , then the spin axis for @xmath18 is the positron direction .    later in this paper",
    ", we will encounter additional bases , whose definitions are inspired by the form of the matrix elements for the processes under consideration .    except for the fermion masses , which we set equal to zero ,",
    "all input masses and coupling constants used in the computations presented in this paper are the central values as reported in the 1996 review of particle properties@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also neglect the coupling between the electron and higgs .",
    "if the higgs is light enough to be observed at lep2 , then its production will be dominated by the process @xmath28 , for which the largest background is @xmath29 .",
    "this suggests the potential for difficulties should the higgs mass lie too close to the mass of the @xmath4 . in particular , at @xmath30 ,",
    "the tree - level cross section for @xmath11 is only 0.5 pb when @xmath31 , compared to 1.2 pb for @xmath12 . as noted by brown  @xcite , this situation improves if @xmath32-tagging is employed , as the higgs decays mainly to @xmath33 whereas the @xmath4 decays to this final state only 15% of the time . rather than",

    "an issue which may be raised concerns the effect of finite detector resolution on the ability of the experimentalists to accurately measure the decay angles we have proposed , especially since they have been defined in the rest frames of the parent particles , not the lab frame .",
    "to get an estimate of the size of these effects , we introduced gaussian energy smearing with a width set by @xmath126 into the energies of the charged leptons and the @xmath32 quarks , and then compared the decay angles reconstructed solely from the smeared momenta to the actual decay angles .",
    "we take the root mean square deviation of this difference to be an estimate of the error introduced by the smearing .",

    "in particular , it would be useful to measure the fraction of longitudinally polarized @xmath4 s in a sample of @xmath4-higgs candidates in both the helicity and  bases .",
