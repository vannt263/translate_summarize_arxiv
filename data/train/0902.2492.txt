    "the luminous galaxy ngc  3718 ( ugc  6524 ; arp  214 ; prc d-18 ) and its dwarf companion ngc  3729 form a galaxy pair in the loose ursa major group @xcite .",
    "morphologically ngc  3718 is quite peculiar : see figure  [ f_optical ] . a strong dark dust lane resembling that in centaurus  a ( ngc  5128 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) runs almost edge - on and straight across the central bulge .",
    "further out , the dust lane diverges into several smooth filaments .",
    "it then twists by almost 90  into an ` s ' shape , forming a diffuse spiral in the stellar light which led @xcite to classify the galaxy as a peculiar barred spiral . as in centaurus",
    "a , an active nucleus is largely hidden behind the dust lane .",
    "a compact radio continuum source less than 0.2pc across has a brightness temperature in excess of @xmath0k @xcite ; @xcite see a jet stretching 0.5  or 40pc  to the north - west .",
    "optical spectroscopy shows a liner of type 1.9 @xcite with weak broad emission at h@xmath1 and a strong narrower line of [ oi ] at 6300 .",
    "the hi  maps of @xcite showed that the dusty gas does not lie in the plane of the stellar disk , but forms a complex three - dimensional structure .",
    "some lines of sight pass more than once through the gas layer , giving rise to multiple velocity peaks ; but the velocity field is strikingly bisymmetric .",
    "schwarz was able to describe the gas layer as a violently warped disk made up of material following concentric but tilted orbits , which twisted by roughly 90  between the inner and outer radii .",
    "the strong straight portion of the dust lane arises where the orbits turn nearly edge - on to our line of sight , at roughly 200  radius .",
    "@xcite mapped molecular gas in the inner part of the dust lane using the co and hcn lines .",
    "@xcite combined those data with interferometric maps at @xmath2  resolution in the co @xmath3 line at 3 mm .",
    "they showed that the co emission traces an inward extension of the warp that @xcite derived for the hi  gas .",
    "ngc  3718 is included as ` related object ' d-18 in the polar ring catalog of @xcite .",
    "because polar ring systems contain gas orbiting in more than one plane , these rare objects constitute one of the few observational probes of the three - dimensional mass distribution of galaxies .",
    "@xcite presented a dynamical model for ngc 3718 to explain the complex shape of the twisted hi  disk mapped by @xcite .",
    "according to this model we see the underlying disk galaxy almost face - on , with the ring gas in near - polar orbit about it .",
    "the tilted gas orbits precess about the symmetry axis of the flattened central galaxy and its dark halo .",
    "orbits at smaller radius precess more rapidly in the galaxy s gravitational field , so the gas disk becomes twisted .",
    "this dynamical model reproduced the main features of schwarz s tilted - ring fit .",
    "it was consistent with a spherical dark halo , and indicated an age for the gas disk of @xmath4  gyr .    to test this model , we mapped the system in the 21 cm  line of neutral hydrogen with the very large array ( vla ) radio telescope .",
    "our new observations , described in section  [ observ ] , improve on those of @xcite in sensitivity and in both velocity and spatial resolution . in section  [ datacube ]",
    "we discuss the gas distribution and compare our results with previous observations . in section  [ tiltmodels ]",
    "we present tilted - ring fits for the gas motions measured in hi  and co , using optical images to resolve ambiguity about where the gas lies in front of the stellar body . in sections  [ kinwarp ] and [ dynwarp ] these",
    "are interpreted as showing a near - polar disk of gas that has become twisted by the differential precession of the gas orbits in the galaxy s aspherical gravitational potential .",
    "table  [ tablebasic ] gives basic information on ngc  3718 and ngc  3729 .",
    "we adopt the distance of 17mpc  given by @xcite for the ursa major group : there , 1  is equivalent to 4.945kpc , 1  = 82.4pc , and 13  = 1.07kpc .",
    "ngc  3718 is a very luminous galaxy with @xmath5l@xmath6 , while for ngc  3729 @xmath7l@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite classified ngc  3718 as t=1 ( sa ) and ngc  3729 as t=2 ( sab ) on the basis of their optical and near - infrared images .",
    "we used the vla in the c configuration in four different observing runs in march and april 1992 , for a total observing time of 26 hours and 28 minutes on source . to obtain",
    "the required velocity coverage and resolution , we observed using two ifs , tuned at slightly different frequencies in order to almost double the spectral coverage . parameters of the observations under proposal as649 are listed in table  [ tableobs ] .",
    "compared to the observations of @xcite , we improve the velocity resolution to 5kms@xmath8  from 33kms@xmath8 , and the spatial resolution from a 25  @xmath9 31  beam to a 13  circular beam .",
    "the complete data reduction was done using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the four data sets were calibrated independently , both for amplitude and phase gains errors that vary with time , and for those that vary with frequency .",
    "the absolute flux scale was determined by observing 3c286 , which has a well - known flux density .",
    "after this , the four databases were combined into one .",
    "inspection of a first mapping of the result allowed us to determine line - free channels at both edges of the band .",
    "the average of these channels was subtracted from the uv data set using the aips task uvlin .",
    "this new data cube , which now contains just line emission , was used throughout in all subsequent mapping and cleaning .",
    "the continuum map shows point sources at the central locations of both ngc  3718 and ngc  3729 .",
    "table  [ tablecontinuum ] lists positions and fluxes of these point sources , with uncertainties 0.5  and 1.0  mjy respectively .",
    "the sources coincide to within this accuracy with the positions given by @xcite at 20 cm and by @xcite at 3 mm ; we take them to represent the center of each galaxy .",
    "the presence of a dust lane prevents an accurate optical position for ngc  3718 , but the various values in the literature agree with this radio position within the error margins . in their appendix  b ,",
    "@xcite quote @xmath10  mjy for the continuum source in ngc  3718 , in reasonable agreement with our value of 14.4  mjy ; we find 7.9  mjy for ngc  3729 , while they give a higher flux of @xmath11  mjy .",
    "the data were fourier transformed using the aips task imagr , using a robustness parameter of 0.0 , resulting in a circular 13beam . a proper choice of robustness @xcite results in better sensitivity than when using uniform weighting , without the strong non - gaussian beam effects normally associated with natural weighting .",
    "we made two data cubes : one with the full 5  kms@xmath8  velocity resolution , and once applying a smoothing over the frequency axis resulting in 10  kms@xmath8  velocity resolution .",
    "the maps with 10  kms@xmath8  resolution showed no additional structure in the outer galaxy , so the 5  kms@xmath8  resolution data were used throughout in this paper .",
    "both cubes were cleaned to a @xmath12 noise level : 0.39  mjy / beam for the full resolution data and 0.30  mjy / beam for the frequency - smoothed data , as given in table  [ tableobs ] .",
    "we list global hi  properties for ngc  3718 and for ngc  3729 in table  [ tableglobal ] . for both galaxies ,",
    "we used a method which corrects for the mismatch between the dirty beam and the clean beam in the residual map @xcite to determine the hi  flux in each channel map , and corrected for the attenuation of the vla primary beam .",
    "the global hi  profiles in figure  [ f_gp ] show no sign of absorption against the weak radio continuum source in either galaxy .    for ngc  3718",
    ", the hi  flux integral of 118  jykms@xmath8  agrees with that found by @xcite and is 20% lower than the value of @xcite .",
    "our flux integral of 3.8  jy  kms@xmath8  for ngc  3729 agrees with the latter authors , but is roughly 5 times lower than given by @xcite .",
    "a recalculation using the map in figure  3 of that paper yields a much smaller flux integral , so the result quoted in @xcite may have been in error .",
    "estimates from single - dish observations vary between 90  jy  kms@xmath8  and 150  jy  kms@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "thus there is little gas in an extended component that would be missed in our maps .    in ngc  3718",
    "we find @xmath13m@xmath6  of hi  gas , about twice as much as in the milky way , while the galaxy is about 50% brighter in stellar light .",
    "the ratio m@xmath14/l@xmath15=0.3 , which is about average for the sample of gas - rich s0 and sa galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "ngc  3729 has only @xmath16m@xmath6  of hi  and is gas - poor compared to a normal sab galaxy ; we find m@xmath14/l@xmath15=0.04 while m@xmath14/l@xmath15=0.1 would be typical @xcite .",
    "the regular , steep - sided and symmetric profile of ngc  3718 suggests that the gas has had time to settle into a steady state . between the points at which the emission falls to 20% of its peak value we measure a width @xmath17=476kms@xmath8 . if the hi  followed pure circular orbits , our measured line width would yield the rotation speed directly : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the maximum rotation speed in the galaxy disk , inclined at angle @xmath20 to face - on .",
    "@xcite find that in disk galaxies we must subtract about 20kms@xmath8  from @xmath17 to correct for random motions in the gas .",
    "for ngc  3718 this would imply @xmath21kms@xmath8 , with little gas in regions where the circular speed is higher .",
    "based on the mean of the velocities at 20% of peak flux , we adopt the systemic velocity @xmath22=995kms@xmath8  for ngc  3718 and @xmath22=1063kms@xmath8  for ngc  3729 . for ngc  3718",
    ", @xcite derived 993kms@xmath8  from the midpoint of their hi  global profile , and 990kms@xmath8  by examining the position - velocity diagram along pa=195 .",
    "for ngc  3729 the agreement is even closer : @xcite find @xmath22=1060kms@xmath8  and 1063kms@xmath8  for the two methods respectively .      .",
    "our adopted systemic velocity @xmath22=995kms@xmath8lies midway between the last channel map in this figure and the first in figure  [ f_chmap_b].,height=755 ]    : channel maps for the hi  distribution in ngc  3718.,height=755 ]    figures  [ f_chmap_a ] and [ f_chmap_b ] show the channel maps for gas in ngc  3718 . in a warped disk made up of gas on concentric but tilted circular orbits , gas at each velocity above the systemic velocity",

    "emission from gas in two extreme channels centred at 765kms@xmath8  and 1222kms@xmath8  has been superposed to show this symmetry .    on either side of the systemic velocity .",
    "lower contours , in red , show gas centred at 1221.8kms@xmath8 ; upper contours , in blue , show gas centred at 765.3kms@xmath8.,height=566 ]    the extreme channel maps containing hi  emission are at 755kms@xmath8and 1232kms@xmath8 , separated by almost exactly our measured width @xmath23kms@xmath8 .",
    "channel maps at 5kms@xmath8  lower and higher velocity are empty .",
    "the emission in these channels extends from 30  from the center to 400 , so @xmath24 should be between 230kms@xmath8  and 240kms@xmath8   over this entire radial range . within 30 ,",
    "either hi  gas is largely absent , or @xmath24 is considerably lower .    within 300  of the center the band of emission in figure  [ extreme_channels ] is narrow , suggesting that we see the gas orbits within 10  to 20  of edge - on . tracing the ridge line of the emission in the extreme channels then gives us the position angle of the gas orbits , as plotted in figure  [ f_ringangles ] . the kinematic major axis swings from close to pa=100  at 30  from the center to pa=190  at radius 400 .",
    "the cube of data can be viewed as a rectangular array of velocity ( or frequency ) profiles .",
    "it is standard practice to reduce the spectral line data further by forming maps containing the value of the various moments of each profile .",
    "the zeroth moment is a map showing the spatial distribution of total hydrogen ; all velocity information is lost . in calculating the zeroth moments we restrict ourselves to that part of the profile where emission is present ; this avoids contamination of the total hi map with noise .",
    "our method of separating emission and noise is automatic : we convolved the cube to a 40  @xmath9  40  beam , and masked ( blanked ) all pixels in the _ high _ resolution cube which were below a @xmath25 noise level in the _ low _ resolution cube .",
    "the moment maps are constructed from the unblanked pixels only .",

    "the tilted - ring model developed for the hi  layer in section  [ tiltmodels ] below , and illustrated in figure  [ f_velfield ] , implies that the projected density along the ` spiral arms ' is increased by warping in the gas layer .",

    "this plot is highly symmetrical , as expected for gas in circular orbit about the galaxy center .",
    "there are two main components : the very strong inner one shows velocities rising steeply to 230kms@xmath8   at 80  from the center , while in the outer component rotation speeds increase almost linearly to 60kms@xmath8  at 300  radius . we interpret the slower - rotating gas as following an orbit at larger radius ; we see only the portion projected close to the center , where the radial velocity is small . on the western side and at negative velocities , there is a third and much weaker component with an intermediate slope . looking towards any point along this line within 80  of the center , we would see a double or triple peak in the hi  velocity profile . if the hi  gas forms a continuously warped disk and we look once through it in the outer parts , then each line of sight must cross the gas layer an odd number of times , so we expect triple profiles .",

    "the disk is made up of rings of material , following near - circular orbits that are concentric but tilted .",

    "they match fairly well to the model fit by @xcite to the co observations : see below . near the galaxy center , the apparent major axis of the gas orbits lies roughly east - west , almost orthogonal to the major axis of the stellar light .",

    "the gas recedes on the east side , so its spin axis points away from us , meaning that @xmath44 .",
    "the warp appears smooth as the disk twists through edge - on , so we follow @xcite in assuming that the inclination decreases monotonically to @xmath45 at larger radii .",
    "@xcite constrained the position angle of the edge - on gas orbit by examining the emission peak closest to the center at velocities close to systemic .",
    "he found that the centroid of that peak moved along a line in @xmath46 as the velocity decreased through @xmath22 .",
    "this is the behavior expected along an edge - on circular orbit in @xmath47 .",
    "we repeated this exercise for the present data set as a consistency check , and find that the central peak moves along @xmath48 .",
    "our measured velocity gradient corresponds to a ring at radius 90 , where the top panel of figure  [ f_ringangles ] shows that the position angle indeed reaches 135 .",
    "thus the gas orbit at this radius is very close to edge - on .    within 300  of the center the hi  gas orbits are less than 10  from edge - on .",
    "so the measured speed @xmath24 should be very near to the orbital speed itself .",
    "our stipulation that @xmath40 should decrease monotonically means that our model predicts too high a value for @xmath24 . to avoid this",
    "we would need a rotation curve like that of the model inspector1 , which peaks beyond the optical radius @xmath49 .",

    "this behavior is consistent with the 10%30% drop in rotation speed that @xcite found to be common in massive s0 and sa galaxies , with rotation speeds above 200kms@xmath8 .",

    "the compact star clusters visible in the right panel of figure  [ f_optical ] are bluer than their surroundings @xcite , indicating relative youth , and the stellar ` spiral arms ' noted in section  3.3 show that some starbirth still occurs in this galaxy .",
    "but because the cool gas is not concentrated towards the main stellar disk , its density may be too low for efficient star formation .",
    "what might have caused the gas layer in ngc  3718 to become warped and twisted ?",
    "a disk of material following orbits tilted away from the galaxy equator will tend to twist because of differential precession . in an oblate galaxy ,",
    "consider a cloud of gas following an orbit tipped by an angle @xmath1 away from the equator , passing upward through the midplane .",
    "the cloud will make a complete vertical oscillation and again cross the midplane traveling upward , before it has made a whole orbit about the center .",
    "the tilt of its orbit remains constant , but the line of nodes , where that orbit crosses the symmetry plane , regresses in the direction opposite to the orbital motion : ( see _ e.g. _  section  5.8 of * ? ? ?",
    "the angular precession rate @xmath69 for an orbit at radius @xmath53 inclined by an angle @xmath1 is related to the circular speed @xmath52 by @xmath70 here @xmath71 represents the gravitational potential energy , averaged over the ring ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath72 is the orbital angular speed .",
    "the quantity @xmath73 measures the flattening of the potential ; it is positive for an oblate system , so @xmath69 is negative . because the orbital periods are shorter towards the center the inner orbits will regress faster , unless the galaxy s flattening increases strongly with radius . thus a gas disk made up of material on concentric tilted orbits generally develops a leading twist .",
    "conversely , a disk in a prolate galaxy potential will twist in a sense that trails the rotation .",
    "its very regular velocity field suggests that the outer hi  disk of ngc  3718 has been in place for at least a couple of orbits . for a rotation speed of 230  kms@xmath8 ,",
    "the orbital period at 400  is roughly 900myr , implying an age of at least 2gyr .",
    "rotation times in the inner disk are much shorter , and at 40radius this would correspond to at least 20 orbits .",
    "the position angle of the gas orbits has twisted by about 120between these radii .",
    "if that twist represents precession in a system of roughly constant flattening @xmath74 , then by equation  [ eqnprec ] we must have @xmath75 for the inner orbits , or @xmath76 . at first glance",
    ", this implies that the gravitational potential must be improbably spherical to prevent the disk from twisting around itself many times in its @xmath77gyr  lifetime .",
    "the twisted dust lane of the peculiar s0 galaxy ngc  4753 presents a similar dynamical problem . here",
    "@xcite found a gas disk extending to roughly 7 times the radius of the inner edge at 13  ( 1kpc  at an assumed distance of 15.8mpc ) that appears to wrap by almost two complete turns around the galaxy pole .",
    "they argue that the outer disk is at least six orbits old , corresponding to 40 orbits at the inner edge .",
    "precessional twisting then implies a nearly spherical mass distribution with axis ratio @xmath78 . the stellar body is flattened with an axis ratio roughly 2:1 ( @xmath79 ) , so these authors conclude that the dark halo must be both round and gravitationally dominant even well within the main stellar body of this luminous galaxy .    a different model for the warped disk of dusty gas in centaurus  a was proposed by @xcite : this had the great advantage of representing a stable equilibrium state .",
    "it requires that the galaxy s mass distribution is not axisymmetric , but a triaxial spheroid tumbling about its short axis .",
    "the potential then supports a family of stable ` anomalous orbits ' described by @xcite , which make up a warped disk .",
    "the dusty gas should settle onto these orbits , in a process studied numerically by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "near the galaxy center , in the core of the gravitational potential , the anomalous orbits circle the long axis .",
    "the pole tilts with radius , until at large radii the orbits lie in the ` equatorial ' plane perpendicular to the short axis , circling it in the opposite sense to the one in which the figure tumbles .",
    "the anomalous orbits make up a twisted disk which follows a _ restricted _ warp : orbits at all radii cross a single line of nodes , which at each instant lies along the intermediate axis of the tumbling triaxial galaxy .",
    "we can understand the anomalous family as a set of orbits that precess about the short axis of the galaxy at exactly the right rate to keep up with the tumbing galaxy potential .",
    "orbits in a triaxial galaxy will precess about the long or short axis at an average rate given by equation  [ eqnprec ] , where @xmath74 is now the average flattening about that axis ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "when the triaxial figure tumbles about its own short axis at a rate @xmath80 , the stable anomalous orbit family consists of just those orbits that precess at the rate @xmath81 . for orbits circling the short axis we have @xmath82 , so",

    "our conclusion remains unchanged .",
    "differential precession changes the  of the gas orbits , but not their  with respect to the stellar disk .",
    "why then should the gas disk have the observed run of tilt ? in the middle panel of figure  [ f_prec_fiducial ]",
    "we show the run of tilt angle that allows the orbits at all radii to precess together in our dynamical model .",
    "the curve is for a halo flattened to an e3 shape , but those for a spherical halo and even an e6 halo lie nearby .",
    "the observed run of tilt lies fairly close to this curve .",
    "we conclude that the warped gas disk has the shape that it does , because that shape has permitted it to survive far longer than would otherwise be the case .",
    "the dynamical model of figures  [ f_prec_fiducial ] assigns the maximum plausible mass to the flattened disk .",
    "we have made high - resolution maps of the hi  gas in ngc  3718 and its companion ngc  3729 .",
    "our data cube for ngc  3718 shows multiply - peaked velocity profiles and a complex but highly bisymmetric structure . using inspector , a task in gipsy , we fitted a tilted - ring model , in which gas following near - circular orbits about the galaxy center forms a warped and twisted layer .",
    "we confirm the conclusions of @xcite , that the prominent asymmetric dust lane marks the region where the orbits of the ( dusty ) gas turn edge - on to the line of sight .",
    "the molecular gas mapped by @xcite shares the motion of the innermost hi  gas .",
    "the unusual diffuse spiral arms fall in regions where gas orbits appear to crowd together on the sky .",
    "the arms are visible in blue light : new stars have formed in the twisted gas layer . as in other galaxies with",
    "extended hi  disks @xcite , spiral structure is observed far out in the disk , where self - gravity should be too weak to provoke the gas to instability and clumping .",
    "the warped and twisted hi  disk can be traced to 500  or 42kpc  from the center .",
    "it is fairly symmetric within 7  or 35kpc , where the orbital period is roughly a gigayear .",
    "so the gas disk has probably been in place for at least a few orbits at this radius , or 23gyr .",
    "further out , symmetrically - placed spiral - arm fragments to the east and west are visible in both hi  gas and blue light .",
    "the polar gas disk is still in the process of formation : the eastern arm fragment continues as a streamer of gas stretching to a cloud 60kpc  north of the galaxy center .",
    "sensitive hi  maps increasingly reveal such long streamers and tails in the outer parts of disk systems , continuous with the regular velocity field of the galaxy , that may represent gas in the process of joining the galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , the gas in polar orbit around ngc  3718 is very dusty ; it is not pristine material .",
    "ngc  3718 has been classified as a barred sa galaxy , but this is misleading .",
    "the apparent bar is an effect of looking through the edge - on disk of dusty gas , and the peculiar diffuse spiral arms instead represent star formation in the warped and tilted gas disk .",
    "k - band photometry @xcite shows an exponential disk close to face - on ; we find no hi  gas orbiting near this plane , so the old stellar disk must be almost empty of cool gas .",
    "instead , ngc  3718 is typical of gas - rich early - type galaxies , where hi  gas is often found far outside the stellar body , and does not share the stellar kinematics @xcite .",
    "when we refer our tilted - ring model for the hi  gas to the most probable plane for the stellar disk , the innermost gas orbits are nearly polar .",
    "we do not see gas orbiting in the plane of the stellar disk itself .",
    "thus ngc  3718 is indeed a polar ring galaxy : as in the archetype ngc  4650a ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) , a gas - poor early - type galaxy is surrounded by a highly inclined gas - rich low - surface - brightness disk .    while the inner parts of the hi  disk are nearly polar , the outer orbits tip to lower inclination .",
    "this pattern of tilt minimizes the destructive effects of differential precession , and has allowed the polar structure to survive until the present day .",
    "the observed pattern of twisting can be explained by a dynamical model for the galaxy in which the gas orbits precess freely about the pole of the stellar disk , and the dark halo is roughly spherical .",
    "polar ring galaxies are one of our few tools for studying the three - dimensional shape of the dark halo .",
    "our models for ngc  3718 allows a round dark halo .",
    "@xcite obtain a similar result for the twisted dust disk in ngc  4753 , concluding that @xmath132 .",
    "the milky way s flattening can be estimated from the near - polar streams of stars torn from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , which undergo differential precession as they orbit our galaxy .",
    "this process yields confusing results , with some aspects of the streams pointing to a slightly oblate halo ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and others to a prolate halo @xcite : see @xcite for a summary .",
    "however , @xcite favor the range @xmath133 for the density , and strongly disfavor a very flattened halo with @xmath134 .",
    "by contrast , studies of the velocity fields in two polar ring galaxies imply strongly oblate mass distributions .",
    "when the dark halo is flattened , polar orbits are generally elongated towards the pole , and the polar rotation curve falls below that in the equatorial plane . by comparing speeds measured for gas in the polar ring with stellar speeds in the central s0 galaxy",
    ", @xcite deduced that the dark halo of ngc  4650a is considerably flattened , with @xmath135 , almost as flat as the stellar disk . in the system a0136 - 0801 , @xcite used fabry - perot imaging to map the two - dimensional velocity field of the polar ring in h@xmath1 emission .",
    "the kinematic major and minor axes were skewed away from perpendicular , a sign that the gas followed oval orbits .",
    "fitting a dynamical model to the velocity field in conjunction with the spatial distribution of the emitting gas yielded a flattening @xmath136 for the system .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that the dark halos of galaxies should be fairly round .",
    "halos formed from cold dark matter alone should be _ prolate , _ with axis ratios 0.60.7 : _ e.g. _  @xcite . adding a baryonic disk flattens the halo in the same sense as the disk @xcite , but only to an average axis ratio 0.70.8 @xcite , although @xcite found that aligned - disk galaxy mergers could produce a halo as oblate as @xmath136 .",
    "if the material of the polar ring was a late accretion onto the central galaxy , we would expect the halo to be flattened in the same sense as the host s disk .",
    "if the ring gas flowed in along filaments of the ` cosmic web ' , as @xcite propose , the dark halo should be oblate close to the host galaxy , becoming prolate and elongated along the filament further out .",
    "@xcite suggested that the polar ring represents the disk of a low - surface - brightness galaxy that captured the dense central body by merger .",
    "the dark halo might then be aligned with its long axes in the plane of the ring .",
    "polar rings indeed deviate from the tully - fisher relation in the sense that bekki s model would predict @xcite ; rotation speeds measured from the gas of the polar ring are higher than expected",
    ".    the dark halos of galaxies may really be quite diverse ; the review of @xcite showed measurements covering the whole range @xmath137 .",
    "but why should we see such a pronounced difference among polar ring systems ?",
    "perhaps this is simply observational selection .",
    "both ngc  4650a and a0136 - 0801 have ` classical ' polar rings , lying nearly perpendicular to the host galaxy s stellar disk . in a galaxy with a flattened halo like ngc  4650a , a gas disk tipped far from the perpendicular as that in ngc  3718",
    "would rapidly become twisted beyond recognition .",
    "strongly tilted rings would survive preferentially in systems with the roundest halos .",
    "another possibility is that the halo shape depends systematically on the galaxy s luminosity . the milky way , ngc 3718 and ngc 4753 are all luminous systems , while ngc  4650a and a0136 - 0801 are several times less luminous , with @xmath138l@xmath6 .",
