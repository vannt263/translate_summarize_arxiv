    "it therefore appears that the lhc , and the lhcb experiment in particular , offers a golden opportunity to make a precise determination of the gluon in this important low @xmath1 domain .",
    "however , first we must face the problem of the choice of factorization and renormalization scales .",

    "we list these below .    *",
    "the nlo qcd prediction strongly depends on the choice of factorization scale , see fig .",

    "for example , the result obtained with the choice @xmath35 is more than twice larger than that for the case of @xmath36 , where here @xmath37 ) .",
    "* moreover , at the nlo , we have a sizeable contribution from the @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) subprocess , where one additional gluon is emitted in the hard collision .",
    "this leads to a considerable smearing of the @xmath1 domain where we sample the incoming gluons .",
    "the smearing is especially strong if we adopt a low factorization scale , because then there is a large phase space allowed for gluon emission from the matrix element .",
    "note that the probability of emission is enhanced by two large logarithms enhancement is the main origin of the scale uncertainty observed in the collinear nlo approach at very small @xmath1 . if we were to decrease the factorization scale @xmath19",
    ", then we have to move gluons with @xmath40 from the pdf to the matrix element .",
    "the problem is that , at very low @xmath1 , there may be several gluons emitted in the pdf , while only one gluon emission is allowed in the nlo matrix element .",
    "this spoils the compensation between the variations of @xmath20 and the pdf , which should provide ( and , indeed , in the larger @xmath1 region , does provide ) the stability of the results under scale variations . ] : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , fig .  [",
    "fig : a1 ] shows that if we choose a scale @xmath43 then the major contribution comes from @xmath44 , and not from @xmath5 as we had hoped . from this viewpoint",
    "it would be better to take a large @xmath19 .",
    "* on the other hand , to differentiate between the low @xmath1 gluons it would be better to work with a relatively low @xmath19 , where the difference between the different global pdf analyses is larger . at high scales",

    "@xmath1 in input distribution , where the input distribution is already well constrained by existing data .",
    "therefore , at larger @xmath19 , predictions for lhcb @xmath15 production , based on different pdf sets , become close to each other .",

    "* finally , at nlo , we also have an unavoidable uncertainty in the prediction of @xmath0 production arising from the choice of the renormalization scale , @xmath28 , which we will discuss in section [ sec : mur ] .",
    "however , despite these difficulties , we show that it is possible to use the lhc @xmath0 data to make a measurement of the shape of the gluon pdf in the interval @xmath49 .",
    "[ t ]     of the gluons sampled in nlo @xmath0 production with @xmath50 at the lhc energy of 7 tev , after the cross section has been integrated over @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the distributions are shown for the mstw08 @xcite and ct10 @xcite parton sets for three values of the factorization scale , namely @xmath31 ( upper pair of curves ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( lower pair of curves at small @xmath1 ) .",
    "note that there is a difference between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , namely @xmath57ln@xmath58 .",
    "this difference is accounted for in the fonll calculation @xcite used to produce this plot .",
    "the renormalisation scale is taken to be @xmath59.,height=302 ]",
    "to overcome the problems associated with the choice of renormalization scale , we may ask for the measurement of the cross section of @xmath15 events in which the two quarks balance each other in the transverse momentum plane to some accuracy ; that is @xmath60 . in other words , to seek events which satisfy a cut on the vector sum of the transverse momenta of the heavy quarks , [ eq : cut - t ] |p_1t+p_2t|<k_0  . of course",
    ", in this way we will lose some of the cross section , but this should not be a problem with the available high lhc luminosity .",
    "another point is that one can not measure the quark momentum directly .",
    "however the momentum of the @xmath2-meson can be measured decay , exploited in @xcite , one can restore the full 4-momentum of the @xmath2-meson based on three constraints : we know the @xmath2-meson mass and its direction ( two angles : @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , since the position of the @xmath2-meson decay vertex is observed in the detector . ] , and due to the strong leading effect - meson carries more than 80% @xcite of the original @xmath16 quark momentum . in this paper , we present results for @xmath0 production .",
    "] in @xmath2-meson production , the event selection , proposed in ( [ eq : cut - t ] ) , can be performed with sufficient accuracy for those events with reasonably small transverse momenta of the @xmath2-mesons , say , @xmath63 gev . moreover in order to better constrain the @xmath1 values of the gluons in our selected events , we may put an additional cut on the pseudo - rapidities of the @xmath2-mesons , say , [ eq : cut - y ] |_1-_2|<1    -0.5<_1,_2<+0.5 . here ,",
    "for illustration , we use the latter cut and present results as a function of @xmath56 .    with the above kinematics it is natural to choose @xmath64 . at first sight , in this way we appear to have excluded any gluon emission due to the nlo matrix element ; a gluon with a transverse momentum , @xmath65 , less than @xmath19 should be included in the pdf , while one with @xmath66 spoils the cut ( [ eq : cut - t ] ) . however , this is not true at nlo .",
    "dglap evolution is written in terms of parton virtualities @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the fraction of parent parton momentum carried by the next ( in this case , final ) parton .",
    "so , a relatively soft gluon with @xmath69 may correspond to @xmath70 , and thus be assigned to the matrix element .",
    "however , this will happen mainly for large @xmath68 close to 1 , that is , in a situation where the emission of an additional ( and now _ soft _ ) gluon does not change the mass @xmath71 of the ` hard block ' too much ; and thus does not smear out the low @xmath1 of the gluon sampled by the process .",
    "to demonstrate how effective the proposed cuts will be in determining the gluon pdf at small @xmath1 , we calculate the expected nlo cross section using two different recent sets of parton distributions , namely mstw08 @xcite and ct10 @xcite , for an lhc energy of @xmath72 tev . to implement the cuts we adapt the subroutines for the matrix elements squared of lo and nlo @xmath0 production that are given in the public mcfm program @xcite .",
    "these subroutines use the expressions given in @xcite for the nlo loop corrections to the @xmath73 subprocess , and the expressions given in @xcite for the @xmath38 subprocess . note that the infrared divergences arising from the emission of very soft gluons are regularized by the so - called ` plus ' prescription , which means that the singularities in the integrands , as the momentum fraction @xmath74 , are tamed by _ 0 ^ 1dzf(z)_+=_0 ^ 1dzz .",
    "the ` plus ' prescription is well justified at very low @xmath68 , and corresponds to the bloch - nordsieck procedure for soft gluon radiation and for the inclusive cross section , where the @xmath75 terms , added in the virtual loop and in the real nlo contributions , cancel each other . however , in the @xmath38 matrix element not only soft gluons are emitted .",
    "if @xmath68 is not small , the cancellation may be spoiled by our cuts .",
    "therefore , to calculate the real @xmath38 contribution we impose the restriction that the virtuality of any external ( gluon or @xmath16-quark ) line , after gluon emission , must be larger than the factorization scale @xmath76 . all contributions with smaller virtualities are included either in the incoming parton distributions or in the quark fragmentation functions .",
    "the remaining @xmath77 contribution , with exactly the same kinematics , due to the additional @xmath75 term , goes to the nlo loop correction to cancel the corresponding ( unphysical , if @xmath68 is not too small ) term in the loop correction to the @xmath73 subprocess was calculated taking the matrix element for very soft gluon emission , keeping the momenta of incoming partons and the outgoing @xmath16-quark fixed .",
    "after this , the @xmath78 singular factor was replaced by the corresponding @xmath78 factor for the @xmath38 event which satisfies all of our proposed cuts . ] coming from the ` plus prescription ' .    as default parameters we take the renormalization scale to be @xmath79 gev , and the factorization scale to be @xmath80 gev .",
    "also we take @xmath81 gev in ( [ eq : cut - t ] ) for the cut on the vector sum of the transverse momentum of the outgoing @xmath16 quarks .",
    "to illustrate the dependence of the predictions for @xmath0 production on the choice of the factorization scale , @xmath19 , we evaluate the cross section for the production of @xmath16 and @xmath82 quarks with both of their pseudo - rapidities in the interval @xmath83 , first using @xmath80 gev , and then for @xmath84 gev .",
    "we repeat the exercise for the interval @xmath85 .",
    "we use the ct10 nlo set of partons @xcite , which are available for @xmath86 gev . for both choices of rapidity intervals ,",
    "the cross section calculated with the higher scale , @xmath84 gev , is about 3 - 4 times larger than that calculated with @xmath80 gev .",
    "such a strong factorization scale dependence is due to the behaviour of the incoming parton densities . in the small @xmath1 domain , relevant for the lhc , the summation of the double logarithmic terms , _",
    "n c_n(_s(1/x)(^2_f / q^2_0))^n , in the dglap evolution , leads to an ( ) growth of the gluon density with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "the exponential growth comes from the sum over the possibilities of emitting different numbers of gluons .",
    "the growth can not be compensated by the ` hard ' matrix element , which at nlo level , allows for the emission of only one gluon .",
    "this double - logarithmic effect is the main source of the strong factorization scale dependence of the predictions for the single @xmath16-quark inclusive cross section .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we choose a ` large ' value of the scale , @xmath87 , then we invalidate our proposed ` @xmath52 ' cut ( [ eq : cut - t ] ) .",
    "recall that an _ integrated _ parton density at a scale @xmath19 includes the effects of all partons with transverse momenta @xmath88 ; and the transverse momentum of an incoming parton with a ` large ' @xmath89 will spoil the @xmath52 balance in ( [ eq : cut - t ] ) . to control the transverse momenta of the incoming partons we may use _ unintegrated _ parton distributions region of interest .",
    "] , @xmath90 , and then integrate them over all @xmath91 .",
    "these distributions can be obtained to nlo accuracy from the conventional integrated pdfs following the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite . however , recall that integrated pdfs are not available at low scales , @xmath92 , less than @xmath93 .",
    "therefore we replace that part of the integral over the unintegrated pdfs with @xmath94 by the ` integrated ' value @xmath95 , where the sudakov factor , @xmath96 , accounts for the probability _ not _ to emit an extra parton , and thus not to enlarge @xmath89 , during the evolution from @xmath93 to @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath96 factor is given by t(q_0,_f )  =  exp(-^_f_q_0 ^1_0 dz  zp_gg^lo+nlo(z ) ) where the precise form of the splitting function @xmath97 is given in @xcite .",
    "with such a procedure , for fixed @xmath98 , the main double - logarithmic effects are correctly included via the unintegrated pdf , @xmath99 , while the single - log dependence of @xmath99 on @xmath19 is mainly compensated by the nlo loop corrections in the ` hard subprocess ' cross section .",
    "the net effect of this procedure , based on ` unintegrated pdfs ' , is a great reduction in the dependence on the choice of the factorization scale .",
    "for example , changing the scale @xmath19 from 2 to 4 gev now leads to less than 20(35)% decrease in the prediction of the @xmath0 cross section in the intervals @xmath100 ( and @xmath101 ) , rather than the factor of 4 ( 3 ) increase , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bb4 ] which we will introduce below .",
    "note that within a 30% accuracy , the result obtained using the unintegrated pdfs coincides with that calculated in the conventional nlo collinear framework with @xmath64 .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on the choice of renormalization scale , @xmath28 , arises from the running qcd coupling , @xmath29 . in general",
    ", the variation of the qcd coupling should be compensated by the logarithmic terms , @xmath102 , in the nlo ( and higher order ) virtual loop corrections @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the region of interest , say , @xmath80 gev and @xmath103 , the corresponding nlo contribution , that is the factor @xmath104 , is practically constant , and does not compensate the variation of the lo term , @xmath105",
    ". therefore the result calculated with @xmath106 turns out to be about 30% smaller than that with @xmath107 . taken together with the uncertainty in the value of the mass , @xmath32 , of the @xmath16-quark",
    ", this leads to an unavoidable uncertainty ( @xmath108 ) , at nlo level , in the normalization of the @xmath15 cross section gev @xcite which was used to describe @xmath0 production at the tevatron . ] .    recall that at these scales the nlo corrections are rather large , larger than the size of the lo contribution .",
    "thus it is not evident that the much more complicated nnlo calculation will improve the accuracy significantly .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of the uncertainties in the normalization that we discussed above , the expected _ ratio _ of the cross sections measured in different rapidity intervals is quite stable and is driven entirely by the @xmath1 behaviour of the gluon .",
    "we illustrate below how this enables lhc @xmath0 data to determine the _ shape _ of the gluon pdf in the interval @xmath109 .    recall that after imposing the cuts of ( [ eq : cut - t ] ) and ( [ eq : cut - y ] ) , the variation of the mass , @xmath71 , created in the hard subprocess , is strongly limited .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath38 subprocess never exceeds 40% of the whole cross section ; typically it only amounts to about 1/3 .",
    "moreover , this @xmath38 contribution arises from relatively soft gluon emission , which does not change @xmath71 very much .",
    "an important consequence is that these @xmath15 events in different intervals of pseudo - rapidity , @xmath56 , sample the gluon in rather narrow intervals of @xmath1 , which allows a precise study of the shape of gluon @xmath1 distribution .",
