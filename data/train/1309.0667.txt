    "since the early days of the field , the measurement techniques used to characterize cold - atom systems have developed significantly .",
    "initially , the most common experimental probe to address cold atomic vapors consisted of absorption imaging of an expanding atomic cloud , thereby providing information on its equilibrium velocity distribution only .",
    "measurements on solid - state systems , however , are typically in the linear - response regime and measure the change of an observable in response to a spatial and/or temporal periodic external perturbation .",
    "these measurements are therefore typically characterized by the frequency and momentum dependence of equilibrium correlation functions , and in solid - state physics a large number of experimental techniques have been developed over the past two centuries to probe different domains in frequency and momentum .",
    "fortunately , in several recent developments , the field of cold atoms is rapidly catching up in the number of available experiment probes which are sensitive to momentum and frequency .    in this article",
    "we focus on dynamic correlations , i.e. , the frequency or time dependence of equilibrium correlation functions . for cold - atom systems the most prominent techniques to probe these are bragg spectroscopy @xcite , radio - frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy @xcite , and , most recently , impact ionization via a scanning electron microscope @xcite .",
    "these techniques respectively probe the structure factor , the spectral function , and the second - order temporal correlations .",
    "most research considers either partially bose - einstein condensed gases @xcite or fermi gases in the crossover regime @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the non - condensed regime of a cold gas of bosonic atoms and on how interactions influence the dynamic correlations in this case .    in particular , in sec .",
    "[ sec : singleparticle ] we consider the frequency dependence of the scattering rate as measured in an rf - spectroscopy experiment .",
    "we compute this scattering rate and find that interactions significantly change the spectrum with respect to the non - interacting case , as they lead to a finite lifetime of the quasi - particles .",
    "we also point out that this scattering rate , when measured above but close to the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation , contains information on the critical exponents of the transition . at the end of this section",
    "we assess the importance of the trapping potential with numerical simulations .    as another example of dynamical correlations , we consider , in sec .",
    "[ sec : spincurrentflucs ] , spin - current fluctuations in a two - component bose gas .",
    "these could be measured by a spin - resolved generalization of the above - mentioned scanning - electron microscope techniques .",
    "the power spectrum of the spin - current fluctuations contains , via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , information on the spin resistivity of the gas that is fully determined by interactions in this system .",
    "moreover , this provides an example of how an equilibrium measurement can be used to determine a transport coefficient when steady - state transport measurements are not readily available as is typically the case for trapped atomic gases .",
