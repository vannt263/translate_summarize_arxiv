    "time resolution for coincidence detection is determined by the shutter / gating time or pulsing of the light source .",
    "electrical amplification is implemented by electron - multiplying ccds ( emccds ) where an amplifier stage , using avalanche diodes , enhances the collected photoelectrons before the output amplification and analog - to - digital conversion .",

    "each pixel contains 720 spads of circular shape with a diameter of 16.87@xmath3 m , the electronics required to count photons and two 12-bit tdcs each having a nominal time resolution of 65ps .",
    "the spads can be individually enabled and disabled due to a dedicated programmable 1-bit memory cell .",
    "this is typically done for those exhibiting a high dark count rate ( dcr ) , i.e.  a high rate of avalanche events induced by thermal generation or tunnelling rather than photon detection .",

    "additionally , this allows to detect coincidence events between photons which are spatially separated below the size of a single pixel . to image the entangled photons from the object plane to the spadnet - i sensor such that the two adjacent beams cover a large area on the sensor without overlapping we choose a telescope system using two lenses with focal lengths @xmath25 mm and @xmath26 mm .",

    "the effective measurement time of 5.4 m frames , during which the sensor acquires time - resolved detection events , is @xmath45 .",

    "the largest tdc code is 155 and thus the average time deviation between pixels is @xmath55ps@xmath56ps .",
    "together with the average spad jitter of 265ps fwhm , a histogram peak of 305ps fwhm would be expected .",

    "accidentals are removed in both graphs ( fig .",

    "we now spatially resolve the coincidence events in relative distances between two pixels using the difference coordinates @xmath64 in units of pixels ( fig .",

    "this comes close to the theoretical value of 3770 events which would be expected at the above measured pde of 0.65% , the beam splitter ratio and the given photon flux .",
    "the discrepancy can be explained by losses in the optical setup which results in single photons without its partner .",
    "the region centered at @xmath67pixels comprises the coincidence events within each beam individually and includes a total of 11176 events .",
    "the photon pair correlation width of less than one pixel measured at @xmath66 pixels suggests , that photon pairs not separated by the beam splitter will be incident on the same pixel and therefore rarely lead to coincidence events between adjacent pixels .",
    "hence , the central region is expected to show considerably less events , especially at a separation of @xmath68 . therefore , most of the coincidence events have to be attributed to crosstalk between neighbouring pixels . a measurement with uncorrelated , classical light of similar power showed a comparable amount of events in this region ( 7880 counts ) and supports this conclusion .    in order to suppress crosstalk events , the same procedure as in section  [ accremoval ] is applied .",
    "a path delay of 300 mm between the left and the right beam temporally separates crosstalk and photon pair detection events .",

    "[ fig : deltapos_taushift_exp ] shows strongly suppressed events around @xmath67 in comparison to the measurement in fig .",

    "[ fig : corrz0theory ] has a width of approximately 0.3 mm at fwhm which is not resolvable by a pixel of 0.6 mm size .",

    "( [ eq : g2 ] ) , the correlation function starts to broaden while moving the central plane of the nlc out of focus using the @xmath23 degree of freedom shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expsetup ] .",
    "in addition , lowering the crystal temperature @xmath19 allows to modify the spdc phase matching from collinear to non - collinear emission of photon pairs which has a similar effect on the correlation function as changing the crystal s @xmath23-position . by using 54 m frames for better statistics ( corresponding to 540ms effective measurement time acquired in 165s ) , fig .",

    "as above , crosstalk is minimized by considering only coincident events of the left half with the right half of the sensor . in order to measure the correlation function in a plane , no path difference is introduced between the left and the right beam to temporally separate crosstalk as before .",
    "because of that , crosstalk of the same magnitude is present in all measurements in the region of small @xmath69 .",

    "the data acquisition time of the here presented measurements is below 3 minutes .",
    "therefore , despite the low measurement duty cycle of 0.33% , the simultaneous measurement on all pixels outweighs conventional scanning experiments in terms of mechanical complexity and in measurement time .",
    "this is even more the case for multi - photon experiments where higher photon numbers are involved . with the given 128 pixels and second - order correlation measurements ,",
    "a time reduction factor of @xmath70 is realized compared to a single pixel scanning experiment with optimal duty cycle . at a pde of 0.57% at 810 nm and a total dcr of 7.9mhz over all pixels , a high rate of accidental coincidence events originating from single photons and",
    "dark count events are expected .",
    "the photon arrival time resolution of 65ps allows to realize a small coincidence window which keeps accidentals at a minimum .",
    "the remaining accidentals can be estimated very accurately and removed in a post - processing step .",
    "the presented measurement of the second - order correlation function is currently only possible by splitting the photon pair and imaging it onto two distant parts of the sensor .",
    "otherwise , pixel crosstalk would have superimposed and , to a large extent , masked the signal .",
    "since the digital signal handling prevents electrical crosstalk events , the observed crosstalk , over distances of more than 100@xmath3 m , has to be mainly of photonic origin .",
    "light emitted in spad avalanche events is reflected back by the glass surface of the chip and thereby leads to secondary detection events .",
    "preliminary measurements with a sensor of the same type having no glass surface on top support this hypothesis . in a next generation chip design , a higher pixel density , a higher pde and a better measurement duty cycle is desirable in order to further reduce the measurement time .",
    "the latter can be achieved by a higher frame rate or , to avoid unfeasible high data rates , by a frame readout triggered by multi - pixel events . to avoid the splitting into individual photon beams in future experiments ,",
