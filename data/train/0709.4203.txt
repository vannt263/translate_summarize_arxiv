    "we report on recent work on constraining the multi - dimensional parameter space of the two - higgs - doublet model by theoretical and experimental results @xcite .",
    "as compared with the standard model ( sm ) , the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) allows for an additional mechanism for cp violation @xcite .",
    "this is one of the main reasons for continued strong interest in the model @xcite .",
    "several experimental constraints restrict its parameter space .",
    "the @xmath0 rate excludes low values of the charged - higgs mass , @xmath1 @xcite , whereas @xmath2 oscillations and the branching ratio @xmath3 for @xmath4 exclude low values of @xmath5 .",
    "the precise measurements at lep of the @xmath6 parameter constrain the mass splitting in the higgs sector , and force the masses to be not far from the @xmath7 mass scale @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , there are also consistency conditions .",
    "the potential has to be positive for large values of the fields @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we require the tree - level higgs ",
    "higgs scattering amplitudes to be unitary @xcite .",
    "together , these constraints dramatically reduce the allowed parameter space of the model . in particular , the unitarity constrain excludes large values of @xmath5 , _ unless _",
    "@xmath8 is reasonably large .",
    "this limit is basically the decoupling limit @xcite .",
    "our recent study @xcite , restricted to the so - called `` type ii '' version , where up - type and down - type quarks couple to different higgs doublets , uses rather complete and up - to - date experimental results , as well as accurate theoretical predictions for the above quantities .",
    "we consider a model with the @xmath9 symmetry respected by the quartic couplings , i.e. , no @xmath10 and @xmath11 couplings .",
    "otherwise , we allow for full generality .",
    "in particular , we allow for @xmath12 violation , taking @xmath13 complex .",
    "( for a definition of the potential , see @xcite . )",
    "the neutral higgs boson sector will thus contain three bosons , described by a @xmath14 mixing matrix @xmath15 .",
    "these three neutral higgs bosons will in general all have @xmath12-violating yukawa couplings .",
    "a related study , focused more on large values of @xmath5 , was also presented at this workshop @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the model in terms of the masses of the two lightest neutral higgs bosons , together with the charged higgs boson mass , @xmath5 , the soft parameter @xmath16 , and the rotation matrix @xmath15 of the neutral sector .",
    "the third ( heaviest ) neutral mass is then calculable , as well as the quartic couplings , @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "r0.68            we establish allowed regions in the @xmath5@xmath1 plane by the following procedure : for each point in this plane , we scan over the parameters @xmath18 , defining the mixing matrix @xmath15 in the neutral - higgs sector , imposing the absolute theory constraints of positivity and unitarity . at each point , we evaluate a @xmath19 penalty corresponding to the experimental constraints , adopting the `` best '' point ( lowest @xmath19 ) in @xmath20 .    for two values of @xmath8 ( 200 and 500  gev ) , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : allowed ] the allowed regions in the @xmath5@xmath1 plane , taking into account the theoretical constraints mentioned above , the lep2 non - discovery , the very precise @xmath21 measurements at lep , as well as the @xmath22-physics constraints ( @xmath23 , mainly ) , and @xmath3 .",
    "the masses of the two lightest neutral higgs bosons are here kept fixed , at @xmath24 and @xmath25 or 500  gev .",
    "the over - all surviving regions of parameter space depend significantly on the `` soft '' parameter @xmath16 . at low or negative values",
    ", the unitarity constraint will cut off the allowed region already at moderate values of @xmath5 .",
    "we have therefore shown results for a couple of positive values of @xmath16 , the higher one approaching the so - called decoupling limit .",
    "it turns out that , if @xmath8 is comparable with @xmath26 , or smaller , the distribution of @xmath27-values will be very narrow , especially at large values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : m3-values - low - mu ] , for @xmath24 , and two sets of @xmath28 values : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "also , we note that for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( lower panels ) , low values of @xmath1 are excluded .",
    "this is basically because of the @xmath21 constraint .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath8 is larger than @xmath26 , the distribution can be considerably wider , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : m3-values - high - mu ] .",
    "-values for fixed @xmath24 . top : @xmath25 and @xmath33 ;",

    "top : @xmath25 and @xmath33 ; bottom : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "we have shown that the constraints of positivity and tree - level unitarity of higgs  higgs scattering , @xmath22-physics results , together with the precise lep measurements , in particular of the @xmath6-parameter at lep , exclude large regions of the 2hdm  ( ii ) parameter space .",
    "high values of @xmath5 are excluded unless @xmath8 is large , allowing @xmath26 and @xmath27 both to be heavy .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 and @xmath27 should be reasonably close to each other . improved precision of the @xmath34 measurement",
    "could significantly reduce the remaining part of the parameter space , but it appears unlikely that the model could be excluded other than by a negative search at the lhc .",
