    "investigating the charge transport characteristics of the surface states has , however , proven to be challenging , because the surface current is usually one or two orders of magnitude less than the bulk current @xcite . in binary or ternary narrow band gap semiconductors ( @xmath5 ) @xcite",
    ", the small defect formation energies and the resultant significant defect densities often result in relatively large carrier densities @xmath6/@xmath3 , leading the bulk conductance to dominate over the surface conductance in transport probe measurements .",
    "while previous materials research has primarily focused on heavily doped , low resistivity ( bi , sb)@xmath0(te , se)@xmath4 for optimizing the thermoelectric figure of merit , the goal of the current research is to achieve highly resistive low bulk carrier concentration crystals that will facilitate the observation of the topological surface state transport .",
    "the original studies of surface transport in tis in the bi@xmath0x@xmath4 family were focused on the binary bi@xmath0se@xmath4 and bi@xmath0te@xmath4 phases @xcite .",
    "near - stoichiometric bi@xmath0se@xmath4 crystals are always heavily - doped @xmath7-type materials due to the presence of charged electron - donating selenium vacancies @xcite , though a small amount of ca substitution for bi yielded @xmath8-type materials @xcite.the defect equilibrium can be written as : @xmath9 near - stoichiometric bi@xmath0te@xmath4 crystals , on the other hand , are @xmath8-type due to the presence of anti - site defects , i.e. bi on the te sites @xcite , with the defect equilibrium : @xmath10 although small contributions of surface state conductance to the total conductivity have been reported in carefully grown , semiconductor - like bi@xmath0te@xmath4 single crystals , the resistivity of the binary compounds has not been reported to exceed 15 @xmath11 @xcite ; the reported surface conductance of bi@xmath0te@xmath4 contributes for those samples less than @xmath12 to the total conductance .    a transition from @xmath8-type to @xmath7-type behavior in the bi@xmath0(te@xmath13se@xmath14)@xmath4 solid solution was reported 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "very recent studies have revealed that when @xmath15 is close to @xmath16 , yielding the structurally ordered phase bi@xmath0te@xmath0se , crystals show high bulk resistivity at low temperatures , exceeding 1 @xmath17 .",
    "this , along with good topological surface state mobilities , results in a surface conductance contribution to the total conductivity of up to two orders of magnitude larger than is observed in bi@xmath0te@xmath4 @xcite . in some such bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ( bts ) crystals , clear shubnikov - de hass oscillations due to the surface states",
    "are observed @xcite . with its much larger surface current contribution",
    ", bts may serve as an ideal model system for the study of spin - selected dirac electron behavior , as well as a starting point for the future development of electronic devices based on topological surface states .",
    "this report describes how such crystals can be obtained .",
    "the defects in the bts ternary ti compound are anticipated to be more complex than those found in the binary systems , though the tendency toward se site vacancies and bi antisite defects , as seen in the binary compounds , is expected to be maintained ; the effects of these and possible associated defects on the carrier density and mobility in the bts ternary compound are still unclear . in this report , we describe the growth of the crystals of high quality bts on which the successful surface transport measurements have been performed , focusing on the characterization of single crystal bi@xmath0te@xmath0se obtained via two different crystal growth methods .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) characterization of the crystals confirms that laboratory - grown bi@xmath0te@xmath0se displays a fully ordered structure in which the te and se atoms occupy their own distinct crystallographic sites with the te in the outer chalcogen layers and the se in the inner chalcogen layer  a factor that may be one of the underlying causes of the high surface mobility of the bts phase .",
    "our electrical resistivity and hall measurements reveal that the crystals carrier concentration is highly sensitive to the se site occupancy .",
    "as expected for small band gap semiconductors , the crystals quality from the perspective of the defects and the resultant carrier concentrations is strongly affected by small inhomogeneities in the chemical composition that occur during the crystal growth .",
    "realizing this difficulty , a bridgman - stockbarger method was employed to fine - tune the chemical composition of the crystals and optimize the carrier concentration .",
    "we show this method to be a controllable way for synthesizing high resistance low carrier concentration bulk crystals of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se .",
    "the relation between the distribution of the donors and acceptors and the crystal properties is briefly discussed .",
    "single crystals of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se were prepared by two methods . the first method , which we specify as a ` modified bridgman ' method , is similar to that presented in ref .",
    "five gram mixtures of high purity ( 5n ) elemental bi , te and se were sealed in quartz ampoules , and then heated up to 850  @xmath18c for 1 - 2 days followed by cooling to 500 @xmath18c at 6 - 12  @xmath18c / h .",
    "the samples were then annealed at 500  @xmath18c for 3 - 4 days .",
    "the crystals obtained by this method are within a large monolithic piece ( @xmath19 ) that usually consists of approximately 10 grains presenting random crystal orientations . for the powder xrd characterization of the laboratory - made bts phase ,",
    "the samples from the ` modified bridgman ' method were in addition annealed at 400  @xmath18c for over 2 weeks and then quenched in cold water .",
    "these samples were compared to samples that were directly quenched in water from the melt without any annealing to test for the robustness of the te - se crystallographic site ordering .",
    "samples of the related compound bi@xmath0tese@xmath0 were similarly prepared for comparison of the structures , and samples for which the te / se ratio was varied in small increments near the formula bi@xmath0te@xmath0se for testing the effects of nonstoichiometry on the electrical properties were also prepared in this fashion .",
    "the samples for xrd were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and characterized by laboratory xrd using graphite monochromated @xmath20 radiation ( d8 focus , bruker ) at room temperature .",
    "rietveld refinements were carried out using the fullprof program suite @xcite .",
    "the classic bridgman - stockbarger method was employed as the second crystal growth method .",
    "this method allows for fine - tuning of the chemical composition of the crystal near the stoichiometric bi@xmath0te@xmath0se composition due to natural variations in stoichiometry along the directionally solidified crystal boule .",
    "thirty grams of mixture was sealed in a long internally carbon - coated quartz ampoule ( 20  @xmath21 long and 0.8  @xmath21 diameter ) .",
    "this ampoule was tapered at the bottom in order to favor seed selection , and then placed in a vertical furnace .",
    "the temperature profile of the furnace was set to ensure that the zone hotter than the melting temperature of the bts was longer than the length of the liquid .",
    "the temperature gradient at the furnace position crossing the melting point of the bts was @xmath22c / cm .",
    "the ampoule was then lowered through the hot zone at the speed of 2 - 4  @xmath23 .",
    "the crystal boules obtained , a characteristic one described in detail in this report , were about 14 @xmath21 long with fewer than 10 crystals , which were all grown with their @xmath24 planes parallel to the long axis of the ampoule .",
    "such a uniform crystal morphology indicates that the boule is relatively homogeneous on a large scale , with its chemical composition gradually varying along the long axis during the directional solidification .",
    "the boule analyzed was cut to seven pieces of about 2 @xmath21 equal length for investigating the electrical properties of different parts ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the resistance and hall measurements from 300  k to 10  k were performed in the @xmath24 plane of the crystals in a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) , and/or in a home - made resistance probe with a keithley 2000 multimeter . for the hall effect measurements ,",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to that plane .",
    "the calculation of the carrier concertration and mobility is based on single band model for simplicity .",
    "considering the samples expected variation in defect concentration , we selected multiple pieces from each region for measurements ; only representative results are presented in this report .",

    "this result is consistent with early xrd experiments @xcite .",
    "inspection of the xrd patterns of bts samples grown by different methods reveals different peak shapes ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the diffraction peaks of the bts samples grown by the modified bridgman method are broad and asymmetric with a low angle shoulder .",
    "we attribute the asymmetric broadening to a range of compositions bi@xmath0te@xmath33se@xmath34 in the crystals .",
    "the xrd pattern of the quenched bts shows significant double - peak character , indicating moderate phase separation , as is expected from fast - cooling a solid solution phase . in comparison ,",
    "the xrd pattern of bts grown by the bridgman - stockbarger method has a much sharper and more symmetric peak shape , indicating that it has a more uniform composition .",
    "this pattern was refined by using fullprof program based on a model with a 2:1 ratio of te to se , as free refinement of the composition did not show significant deviation from that formula . as shown in table [ table1 ] , the sample has near - perfect order of the se and te layers , with around 4% disorder on the outer layers that support the topological surface states .",
    "we attribute the imperfect fit to some of the peaks to structural defects introduced during the grinding of the very soft bts material .",
    "in contrast , bi@xmath0tese@xmath0 shows full disorder on the outer layers , with 50/50 te / se occupancy .",
    "being a nearly fully ordered crystal , bi@xmath0te@xmath0se promises relatively low electron scattering that might be present due to general structural disorder at the surface , which is a te layer , unlike what would be seen for bi@xmath0(te , se)@xmath4 at higher selenium contents than bi@xmath0te@xmath0se , where the surface layers would be substantially mixed .",
    "hence this work focuses on tuning the carrier concentration of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se and measuring its general electronic transport properties to allow for its optimization for study of the transport due to the topological surface states .",
    "as will be shown below , the relative homogeneity of bts crystals grown via different methods has an impact on their observed electron transport properties .",
    "+    as a starting point for the research , the temperature dependent resistance ( shown as @xmath35 ) and hall coefficient ( @xmath36 ) were measured for stoichiometric bi@xmath0te@xmath0se prepared by the modified bridgman method . as shown in fig .",

    "this @xmath38 position is similar to that seen in metallic bi@xmath0se@xmath4 in the arpes measurements @xcite .    in order to explore the possibility of finding a low carrier concentration sample in the vicinity of the @xmath39 transition point in the bi@xmath0te@xmath40se@xmath13 , solid solution ,",
    "the series of samples synthesized near the stoichiometric formula bi@xmath0te@xmath0se was characterized . because nominally stoichiometric bts is @xmath7-type in the modified bridgman crystal growths , samples of interest for reaching the crossover are expected to be rich in te , where a greater tendency toward @xmath8-type behavior is expected ( because bi@xmath0te@xmath4 is naturally @xmath8-type ) .",

    "+    tuning the selenium concentration in the selenium excess or deficient bi@xmath0te@xmath0se@xmath56 series near @xmath57 can induce significant changes in the carrier concentration in bts .",

    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) ) , which shows @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "it is worth noting that different crystal samples from one batch show dramatic differences in resistance when @xmath65 . such significant sample - to - sample variation for crystals obtained from the ` modified bridgman ' method presents a difficulty for their use in future research on surface state transport properties .",
    "+    it is well known that a temperature gradient in a bridgman growth furnace can induce a distribution of the chemical composition for a solid solution phase with a variation in melting point @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was recently employed in the optical floating zone growth of the solid solution of la@xmath69sr@xmath70mn@xmath0o@xmath71 for exploring a fine structure of the charge and orbital phases in the diagram near @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "motivated by the partial success of the slightly se - deficient crystals obtained in the modified bridgman growths , a bridgman - stockbarger method was used for growing a crystal at a slightly se deficient composition , bi@xmath0te@xmath0se@xmath73 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the @xmath41 and @xmath36 data for different parts of the long bridgman - stockbarger crystal boule ( see top of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . at the growth",
    "starting point ( g and f ) , the samples show metallic resistivities and small negative hall coefficients , which is similar to the metallic crystals obtained by the ` modified bridgman ' method . in the middle part of the boule ( parts c , d , and e ) ,",
    "the samples show semiconducting resistivity and much larger absolute values of @xmath36 .",
    "the three samples show positive @xmath36 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xmath49 at 300  k , leading to hole concentrations of @xmath76/@xmath3 . @xmath36",
    "significantly increases with decreasing @xmath77 , leading to a positive maximum at about 70  k for samples c and e , and at about 200  k for sample d. on cooling below the maximum , @xmath36 then decreases with decreasing @xmath77 , crosses zero and shows a negative maximum at 10  k for all three samples , leading to the electron concentration @xmath78@xmath79 at 10  k ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) ) . given that the typical thickness of the samples is about @xmath80-@xmath81 @xmath82 , this number is still one order of magnitude larger than the estimated surface electron contribution ( @xmath83/cm@xmath25 ) , but the surface conductivity is similar in magnitude to the bulk conductivity due to the high surface mobility @xcite .",
    "the observed positive to negative transition of @xmath36 with temperature is similar to the previous reported experiments @xcite , which clearly reveals the coexistence of two types of carriers in these bts crystals .",
    "the samples turn back to being metallic at the top part of the boule ( parts a and b ) , in which the carrier concentration becomes large and negative @xmath85 . although the sample shows metallic or semiconducting behavior at different positions along the boule , the properties are homogeneous on the scale of about 2  cm .",
    "the bridgman - stockbarger crystal boules made with the starting compositions bi@xmath0te@xmath0se@xmath86 and bi@xmath0te@xmath0se@xmath87 do not show semiconducting behavior ( data not shown ) .",
    "this indicates that the bridgman - stockbarger method employed to grow this material induces less than a 1% difference in chemical composition along the boule .",
    "we have shown here that the optimal defect densities can be obtained either accidentally in the crystals obtained by modified bridgman growth or systematically at the @xmath7-to-@xmath8 crossover region in crystals obtained by the bridgman - stockbarger crystal growth method .",
    "the detailed transport properties of the surface states for the semiconducting crystals obtained here are reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "+    the carrier concentrations ( @xmath7 ) and mobilities ( @xmath88 ) at 10  k and 300  k for the seven samples at 10  k are plotted in fig .",
    "the mobility was calculated by assuming single majority carriers dominating at 10 and 300 k. the metallic samples ( a , b , f and g ) show similar @xmath7 and @xmath88 values at 10  k and 300  k , which is expected in heavily doped semiconductors .",
    "the semiconducting samples ( c , d and e ) show @xmath88 less than 100 @xmath89 at 10  k , which is similar to previously reported bulk mobility values for bts @xcite . at 300  k ,",
    "the mobility of the hole pocket is much less ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "such small mobility may be due to the large effective hole mass .",
    "the correlation between the mobility and carrier concentration for the semiconducting samples requires further investigation .",
    "based on our synthesis and characterization of a large number of bts crystal samples , we can come to some conclusions about the relation between the chemical composition and the carrier distribution .",
    "stoichiometric bts is always a heavy - doped @xmath7 type material showing metallic behavior , while slight tuning of the te / se ratio by changing the nominal composition at the percent level ( @xmath91% ) does not lead to semiconducting samples .",
    "in addition , starting with an excess amount of se in the bts growths , in an attempt to suppress the formation of se vacancies , drives the materials more metallic .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that the starting bi@xmath0te@xmath0se@xmath92 will result in a mixture of bi@xmath0(te@xmath93se@xmath94)se with excess te , because the more electronegative se atoms tend to bond with bi atoms more strongly than they do with te atoms . reducing the se starting concentration on the other hand yields higher resistance samples , which are highly inhomogeneous when obtained by the modified bridgman growth method .",
    "this behavior indicates that reducing the se starting concentration in bts probably does not introduce the se vacancies known to contribute @xmath7-type carriers in bi@xmath0se@xmath4 .",
    "we postulate instead that many of the se vacancies that would have been the result of se deficiency will be filled by te atoms , while the excess bi atoms that are present as a consequence will occupy the sites left vacant by the displaced te , leading a @xmath8-type doping .",
    "we propose a more complex defect equilibrium for bts : @xmath95 this @xmath7-type carrier compensation mechanism is highly sensitive to the stating material ratio and the sample processing , leading to the high electronic inhomogeneity in the crystals grown by the modified bridgman method .",
    "further study will be required to determine whether our proposed defect model for bts is correct .    with its large temperature gradient at the freezing point ,",
    "the classical bridgman - stockbarger method can introduce a continuous chemical composition distribution , and in the case of bts can therefore allow for the achievement of highly resistive samples by selecting the appropriate position along the boule .",
    "the semiconducting samples all manifest a majority carrier type changing from @xmath8-type to @xmath7-type on cooling from 300  k to 10  k. a previous study suggested that the acceptors are from an impurity band with a gap @xmath96 from the chemical potential @xcite , while our recent studies on bts crystals under pressure reveal a satellite hole pocket @xmath97 lower than the chemical potential @xcite . sample d shows an @xmath36 maximum at 200  k , higher in temperature than the current samples c and e and the samples reported in ref.@xcite , which indicates that its chemical potential may be closer to the bottom of the conduction band , leading to a larger gap with the hole pocket .",
    "it is worth noting that the samples with higher temperatures for the @xmath36 maximum ( such as sample d ) show a larger @xmath7-type carrier concentration at 10  k. we believe that the @xmath7-type carriers observed at low temperature in our measurements have a minor contribution from the surface metallic state and are mainly from a donor impurity band .",
    "this impurity band is likely extended from states due to charged se vacancies that are hybridized with the conduction band .",
    "the chemical potential being closer to the conduction band in the band gap yields more donors at base temperature .",
    "our studies indicate that the bts samples with small amounts of @xmath8-type doping made by the modified bridgman or bridgman - stockbarger techniques are more likely to be semiconducting than the stoichiometric samples .",
    "given that the electrons at the bottom of the conduction band are lighter than the holes at the top of the valence band , the donors more easily form an impurity band near the electron pocket than the acceptors do near the hole pocket .",
    "in other words , at equivalent n- and p - type defect concentrations , the fermi level will be pinned near the isolated @xmath8-type energy levels in the band gap , yielding semiconducting samples , whereas the extended @xmath7-type impurity band leads bi@xmath0te@xmath0se to be metallic for equivalent n - type carrier concentrations .",
    "this assumption is consistent with our previous studies on ca - doped bi@xmath0se@xmath4 @xcite . although the bulk mobility of the semiconducting bts samples is usually small @xmath98 , the surface states manifest much higher mobility , leading to the observations of quantum oscillations previously reported .",
    "further optimization of the crystal growth and doping of bts is expected to yield excellent crystals for the study of topological surface state transport and the fabrication of surface - state - based electronic devices .",
