    "added a cosmic term with a positive cosmological constant @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) to his primary field equation to modify it into @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the metric of spacetime .",
    "after hubble s discovery of the cosmic expansion , einstein withdrew the @xmath8-term in eq.([eez ] ) .",
    "it is widely believed that einstein introduced the cosmological constant into his field equation as a repulsive energy that fills `` empty '' space to prevent the universe from collapsing by the gravitational pull of the matter ( see , e.g.@xcite ",
    "@xcite ) . consequently",
    ", when the cosmic expansion is observed to be accelerating @xcite , which suggests the presence of universal repulsive dark energy , eq.([eez ] ) has been used again as a fundamental equation of the standard cosmological model lcdm .    however , the positive cosmological constant @xmath8 introduced by einstein represents in fact just `` _ the actual mean density of the matter in the universe _ '' @xcite . in his original paper einstein stated :    `` _ the newly introduced universal constant @xmath8 defines both the mean density of distribution @xmath12 which can remain in equilibrium and also the radius @xmath13 and the volume @xmath14 of spherical space .",
    "_ ''    in a letter to willem de sitter on 14 june 1917",
    "einstein @xcite explained it more clearly :    `` _ in my paper , the density @xmath12 is a matter density when the matter assembled in stars is uniformly distributed in the interstellar space .",
    "_ ''    therefore , in einstein s field equation with a positive cosmological constant in lcdm , the repulsive dark energy , as another fundamental composition of the universe besides matter , has not been included yet , and how introducing dark energy into the cosmological field equation needs to be re - considered .",
    "the newtonian equation for gravitational field @xmath15 with density @xmath16 of matter is @xmath17 the poisson equation ( [ ee0a ] ) in the framework of galilean spacetime is a starting point to construct einstein s field equation of gr and a standard to test the correctness of the constructed gr field equation . to construct a cosmological model where the dark energy is another fundamental constituent besides matter , we should also firstly write out the field equation for dark energy in galilean framework , rather than just simply add a constant term to the gravitational field equation ( [ ee0 ] ) of gr , which was established in 1916 when matter s gravity was the only known force effective at cosmological scales .",
    "it is natural that the field @xmath18 of repulsive dark energy coupled with matter has the same form with that of matter gravity but opposite sign , i.e. the field equation of dark energy with density @xmath19 in galilean framework should be @xmath20 from eq.([el0 ] ) , the dark energy with density @xmath19 can be regarded as a kind of matter , it has also positive inertial mass with density @xmath19 , but negative gravitational mass with density @xmath21 from comparing with the field equation ( [ ee0a ] ) of matter with density @xmath16 .    for cosmological consideration , matter is smoothed to be uniformly distributed with a mean density @xmath22 , the cosmological field equation for a universe constituted from both matter and dark energy in galilean framework should be @xmath23    for a physical world constituted by matter with density @xmath16 and non - negligible dark energy with @xmath19 , the `` inertial mass '' is evaluated in terms of @xmath24 , but the `` gravitational mass '' should be evaluated in terms of @xmath25 , where the `` inertial mass '' is not equal to the `` gravitational mass ''",
    ". consequently , the equivalence principle is not valid yet for cosmology with both gravity and dark energy , and the general theory of relativity is no longer a suitable framework for cosmology as well , we thus have to work with the galilean framework from the start .",
    "the cosmological field equation ( [ fe ] ) describes a dark energy and matter gravity coupling ( demc ) universe driven by the resultant force of attractive gravity and repulsive dark energy .",
    "in contrast , the field equation in galilean framework corresponded to einstein s field equation ( [ eez ] ) is @xmath26 with @xmath27 , it shows that the einstein s cosmological field equation includes only gravity , not any repulsive energy .",
    "if the density @xmath19 really describes a repulsive energy , then , not the `` inertial density '' , but the `` gravitational density '' @xmath28 should be included in the right hand side of the poisson eq.([fen ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that eq.([fen ] ) , the newton s limit of einstein cosmological equation , is not a proper cosmological equation in galilean framework .",
    "the neumann - seeliger paradox for newton s theory states that a cosmological model for uniformly distributed matter can not be constructed from the gravitational field , because from newton s field equation ( [ ee0a ] ) the field intensity @xmath29 .",
    "however , for a demc universe , it is governed by the universal density difference , @xmath30 , of two coupled fundamental cosmic fields .",
    "the neumann - seeliger paradox can be avoided as the combined field of mater and dark energy vanishes with @xmath31 for the universe and inertial frames of reference can exist globally .",
    "consequently , it is able to construct a cosmological model from the field equation ( [ fe ] ) with the galilean framework .        the total rest energy of the universe with the field eq.([fe ] ) in the framework of galilean spacetime @xmath32 where the universe volume @xmath33 with @xmath13 being the universe radius .",

    "whereas the summation @xmath50 in eqs.([trest ] ) and ( [ rest ] ) of rest energy is the `` inertial density '' of the combined cosmic field .",
    "the `` inertial density '' has to be separated from the `` gravitational density '' when @xmath19 can not be ignored .",
    "therefore , friedmann s equation ( [ fri ] ) with @xmath50 in the term of the potential energy is obviously not proper for an universe constituted by matter and dark energy .",
    "confusing the two kinds of energy density could be a reason why such an impropriety in lcdm cosmology has not been recognized for a long time .",
    "it is interesting to see why friedmann s equation ( [ fri ] ) with only pulling energy can interpret the acceleration of the universe . with a constant @xmath19 and after dark energy domination , the increase of the scale factor @xmath51 with expansion causes the first term at the right - hand side of eq.([fri ] ) increasing .",
    "then , from eq.([fri ] ) with a constant @xmath47 ( conservation of mechanical energy ) , the expansion rate @xmath52 at the left - hand site of eq.([fri ] ) has to be increasing as well .",
    "such an interpretation implies a fantastic physics : the total mass of the universe is infinitely increasing with time and the added mass is immediately and completely converted into the kinetic energy of expansion .",
    "however , applying friedmann s eq.([fri ] ) with a constant @xmath19 to an expanding universe is just to use a conservation of energy equation to evaluate a process where the energy is supposed to be not conserved , will inevitably cause misconceptions in physics : that the cosmic expansion can be accelerated by a gravitational force @xmath53 or decelerated by a repulsive force @xmath54 from eq.([fri ] ) results from violating the conservation law of energy in lcdm .      for a dark energy and gravity coupled expanding universe described by the field eq.([fe ] ) with radius @xmath13 , newton s second law of motion reads @xmath55 substituting the rest energy ( `` inertial mass '' ) @xmath56 and the driving force from the `` gravitational mass '' @xmath57 into eq.([n2 ] ) , we get the following cosmological equation of motion @xmath58 the above equation shows that the universal expansion is driven by the energy difference @xmath59 : for a phase of matter domination ( @xmath60 ) , dark - energy domination ( @xmath61 ) , or equilibrium ( @xmath62 ) , the universe is decelerated , accelerated , or uniformly expanding , respectively .    in lcdm cosmology , the following approach is widely used in textbooks on cosmology , e.g. @xcite , to deduce the cosmological equation of motion .",
    "applying the first law of thermodynamics to a comoving volume of an adiabatic expanding universe with energy density @xmath12 and pressure @xmath63 gives the fluid equation @xmath64 taking the time derivative of the first friedmann s eq.([fri ] ) yields @xmath65 with assumption that the fluid eq.([law1 ] ) is valid for matter and dark energy separately , then from eq.([dfri ] ) one could get the second friedmann s equation @xmath66 where the pressures of matter @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the parameter of equation of state , and the pressure of dark energy @xmath69    eq.([wl ] ) is derived from eq.([law1 ] ) for the dark energy with @xmath70 .",
    "the fluid eq.([law1 ] ) is another manifestation of energy conservation , however , the dark energy is not conserved for an expanding volume with a constant @xmath19 , and then the fluid eq.([law1 ] ) can not be applied to it at all . that the universal field with @xmath71 has a repulsive pressure as shown by eq.([wl ] ) results again from violating the conservation of energy . by making use of eq.([wl ] ) , the standard model makes the positive constant @xmath19 to produce a repulsive pressure .",
    "however , from the first friedmann s equation ( [ fri ] ) , the same constant @xmath19 behaves just like another gravitational pull source addition to the matter .",
    "this contradiction indicates that interpreting the cosmic expansion by means of equations of state or pressures is not a correct approach .",
    "cosmologists often use an expanding blown balloon to illustrate the expansion of the universe : dots on the surface of the balloon representing galaxies move apart from each other but stay the same size .",
    "it is obvious that we have to separate the field source that drives the global expansion of the universe ( the blowing of pump or mouth in the balloon analogy ) from that governs the local motions within a galaxy ( within a dot in the balloon analogy ) .",
    "the motion equation in demc cosmology , eq.([f2 ] ) , can meet the requirement : the expanding universe is indeed driven by the universal gravity and dark energy . on the contrary , eq.([fri2 ] ) makes use of the pressure of matter .",
    "the pressure @xmath72 of matter , including radiation pressure , is a physical quantity to describe a local system , therefore , in lcdm cosmology the global expansion of the universe is governed by local processes of matter ( just like the balloon s expansion being governed by physical processes within dots ) . at cosmological scales ,",
    "all local inhomogeneities of matter specified by @xmath6 are smoothed out to be homogeneous with a density of @xmath73 .",
    "the global expansion of the universe should be driven by the intrinsic gravitational pull of @xmath73 , noting to do with the state of matter .",
    "the universe expansion causes the temperature to decrease , then the state of matter to change , but not vice versa .      in demc",
    "cosmology , the density @xmath30 appears in the energy equation ( [ f1 ] ) in the term representing the potential energy of the combined cosmic field , and also in the motion equation ( [ f2 ] ) representing the force driving the expansion as well . eliminating it by combining equations ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] )",

    "in fact , in constructing the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker cosmological model from gr , there must be an additional constraint in einstein field equation , the cosmological principle or robertson - walker metric , to impose a globally uniform space and an universal time upon the universe .",
    "thus , under the cosmological principle , friedmann s equations can be also derived from poisson eq.([ee0a ] ) and newton s law of motion @xcite , or , newtonian cosmology can correspond to a cosmological theory from gr with robertson - walker metric @xcite .",
    "therefore , neither gr nor newton s theory , but the additional cosmological principle is the real foundation of current models of cosmology .    in contrast to gr and newton s",
    "theory , homogeneity and isotropy is a natural result of the demc field equation ( [ fe ] ) under galilean framework .",
    "the two coupled and balanced cosmic fields with poisson eq.([fe ] ) provide a simple and sound physical foundation for cosmology with homogeneity , isotropy , energy conservation , non - locality , and non - singularity .",
    "therefore , our universe should possess a composite symmetry consisting of global galileo invariance and local lorentz invariance . to describe the motion of an object in the universe",
    ", we have to consider both local motion in a gravitationally bound system by eq.([ee0 ] ) of gr with lorentz invariance , and the universe expansion in the cosmological comoving system by poisson eq.([fe ] ) with galileo invariance .",
    "combining the two kinds of invariances in such calculations , the principle of relativity still holds , or , in other words , to describe a physical world consisting of different parts with different symmetries , we have to apply different kinds of invariances .",
    "the two kinds of cosmological models , lcdm and demc , have a similar thermal and nucleosynthesis histories after inflation , but completely different from each other before inflation .",
    "if the demc scenario is valid , there would be no hot big bang for our universe as shown in fig.[fig : evo ] , and the planck era may never exist during the whole history of our universe .",
    "consequently , instead of seeking for a grand unification , we should accept a composite scheme for our universe : the cosmic- , macro- , and micro- worlds are governed by galileo , lorentz , and yang - mills invariances , respectively . +",
