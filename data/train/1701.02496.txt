    "<S> internet - of - things ( iot ) architectures connecting a massive number of heterogeneous devices need energy efficient , low hardware complexity , low cost , simple and secure mechanisms to realize communication among devices . </S>",
    "<S> one of the emerging schemes is to realize simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) in an energy harvesting network . </S>",
    "<S> radio frequency ( rf ) solutions require special hardware and modulation methods for rf to direct current ( dc ) conversion and optimized operation to achieve swipt which are currently in an immature phase . on the other hand , magneto - inductive ( mi ) </S>",
