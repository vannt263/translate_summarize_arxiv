    "ferromagnetic systems have attracted much interest for a long history because of the intriguing physics and applications.@xcite as the development of information technology , the research on magnetization dynamics in micromagnets has become an active field.@xcite great efforts have been devoted to this field by aiming to manipulate magnetization more efficiently.@xcite for theoretical simulation , the magnetization dynamics is usually described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation,@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the direction of the magnetization . @xmath5 in the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([eq1 ] ) is the effective magnetic field which drives the magnetization procession and determines the domain structure in the equilibrium states . up to date",
    ", different sources of effective magnetic field have been identified , e.g. , the external magnetic field , the crystal anisotropy induced by the spin - orbit coupling , the exchange energy due to the spatial inhomogeneity , and also the demagnetization field from dipole - dipole interaction.@xcite the second term , the gilbert damping torque , describes the magnetization relaxation to the effective field axis on the time scale of @xmath6.@xcite the last one with first - order gradient of the magnetization is the spin torque induced by the transport of the spin polarized itinerant electrons , where @xmath7 is proportional to the spin current density.@xcite the @xmath2-term,@xcite first proposed by zhang and li,@xcite was demonstrated to be critically important to the current - driven domain wall motion , which overwhelms the threshold current due to pinning force and transverse anisotropy for domain wall motion@xcite and results in the steady domain wall velocity @xmath8 in the absence of the external magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the determination of the effective magnetic field and the parameters in the llg equation , such as @xmath9 and @xmath2 , is an important issue for magnetization dynamics study.@xcite    previously , we have derived the gilbert damping ( @xmath9 ) term based on the kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach@xcite in homogeneous ferromagnetic systems.@xcite in the present work , we derive the whole llg equation from the @xmath0-@xmath1 model in inhomogeneous ferromagnetic systems based on the same approach .",
    "from the first - order gradient of the magnetization inhomogeneity , we obtain the current - induced torques which are consistent to the above llg equation . within the second - order gradient",
    ", we find that the llg equation should be modified and written as @xmath10 the second - order gradient introduces two contributions to the effective magnetic field . the one given by @xmath11",
    "is identified as the spin stiffness field discussed in previous works.@xcite the other term , in the form of @xmath12 , has never be referred in the literature . in the present paper ,",
    "we call it `` vertical spin stiffness '' in the sense of the fact that this new field is vertical to the plane defined by the magnetization and the normal spin stiffness @xmath13 .",
    "interestingly , this vertical spin stiffness can not be written in terms of the free energy , and therefore , it can not be derived from the functional derivative of the free energy with respect to the local magnetization @xmath14/{{\\bf m}_d}$ ] previously.@xcite we find that this vertical spin stiffness results in the tilt of the magnetization . the new term can significantly change the domain - wall structure in ferromagnetic semiconductors .",
    "since the magnitude of this field is proportional to the factor of @xmath2 , the proposed effect is expected to be important in ferromagnetic semiconductors where @xmath2 is large due to the strong spin - orbit interaction.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we setup our model and derive the ksbes for the itinerant electrons in the inhomogeneous ferromagnetic system .",
