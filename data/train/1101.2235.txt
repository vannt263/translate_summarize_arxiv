    "water acts in many ways , from dissolving salt to creating the medium for all life on earth .",
    "it is so important and multifaceted that whole books can be and are written about it .",
    "see , for example , david eisenberg s and walter kauzmann s timeless and recently re - issued monograph on the physical properties of water  @xcite .",
    "our charge in these three lectures is to describe something about this material from a molecular perspective . in limiting scope , we focus on thermal fluctuations and their consequences on solvation and self - assembly .",
    "the presentation is like that of a textbook chapter , not a comprehensive review .",
    "we make use of statistical mechanics at the level it is treated in ref .",
    "while our focus is on water , what we say applies to much of liquid matter , where good background is found in ref .",
    "barrathansen2003 .    the perspective we adopt",
    "is influenced by the results of computer simulations because this approach provides unambiguous microscopic detail , albeit for idealized models .",
    "combined with experiments and theory , simulation is central to all modern understanding of condensed matter .",
    "water is a most important example .",
    "computer simulations of water were pioneered in the 1970s by aneesur rahman and frank stillinger .",
    "many subsequent advances have validated their general approach and enhanced our understanding of water .",
    "reviews of that early work in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite remain informative to this day .",
    "our first lecture covers properties of pure water , particularly distribution functions related to local arrangements of water molecules .",
    "the second lecture is about free energies of solvation and how these free energies are related to the statistics of spontaneous molecular fluctuations in water .",
    "the third and last lecture builds from that stage to treat forces of self assembly , especially hydrophobic forces , which act on molecular and supramolecular scales .",
    "figure  [ fig : waterstructure ] illustrates the water molecule and its most significant interaction  the hydrogen bond . though the molecule is quite polar , its electron density is dominated by the electrons of the oxygen atom . as such , the space - filling volume of a water molecule is approximately spherical with van der waals radius of  @xmath0 , like that of its isoelectronic partner , neon . because this volume is roughly spherical , it is often convenient to identify the position of a water molecule with the position of its oxygen nucleus .",
    "the @xmath1 chemical bond is about  @xmath2  long and the @xmath3 angle is about @xmath4 .",
    "theory for dewetting requires treatment of both interfaces and small length - scale fluctuations .",
    "high free - energetic costs of solvating excluded volumes at small length scales gives way to lower costs in the presence of soft interfacial fluctuations .",
    "here , we describe how to build a theory that captures this physics with a density field that describes interfaces and a coupling of that field to small - length scale fluctuations .",
    "the development uses some elements of statistical field theory , and while it is therefore a step beyond the simplicity adopted in the earlier parts of our lectures , good textbooks on the topic do exist .",
    "see , for instance , mehran kardar s  kardar2007b .",
    "interfaces are well described by density fields that vary slowly on molecular scales . in the simplest case , the energetics of such a field , @xmath5 ,",
    "is given by a landau - ginzburg hamiltonian of the form @xmath6   = \\int \\text{d}\\mathbf{r } \\left [ w(n(\\mathbf{r } ) ) + \\frac{m}{2 } | \\nabla n(\\mathbf{r } ) |^2 \\right ] \\,,\\ ] ] where we use subscript `` l '' to indicate that this hamiltonian applies to a fluid on _ large _ length scales only .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is a local ( grand canonical ) free energy density in units of @xmath8 , and the parameter @xmath9 determines the free energy cost to create an inhomogeneity .    in mean field theory , the average @xmath5 is the function that minimizes this hamiltonian ( subject to whatever constraints specify the ensemble considered ) .",
    "this minimization produces a spatially invariant value for @xmath10 , except at conditions of phase coexistence where an interface separates volumes with different values of the field .",
    "the interfacial tension for this interface is proportional to @xmath9 and the shape of the interface is determined by the function @xmath7 .",
    "these relationships can be read about in standard texts , e.g. ref .",
    "rowlinsonwidom2003 .",
    "the actual molecular density , @xmath11 , can be written as a slowly varying field like @xmath12 plus a correction , where the correction accounts for fluctuations that occur on small - length scales .",
    "in particular , we take @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the small - length scale part . there is flexibility in defining this decomposition , but it is important that @xmath5 varies little over a length @xmath15 , which is correlation length of the homogeneous liquid . with this generic criterion ,",
    "the vapor phase of water is where @xmath5 is close to zero , and the liquid phase is where @xmath5 is close to the density of liquid water .",

    "the most important of these alterations comes from excluded volume @xmath27 due to a solute .",
    "this constrains the partition sum in a fashion that is compactly described with the functional @xmath28 = \\begin{cases } 1,&\\text{when $ \\rho(\\mathbf{r})=0 $ for all $ \\mathbf{r}\\in{v}$,}\\\\ 0,&\\text{otherwise } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 denotes the volume that the solute excludes from the solvent .",

    "it suffices to characterize the function in terms of a mean strength and range , i.e. , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the mean strength with a value of the order of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is normalized with a range of a few  s . the theory constructed with eq . is not terribly sensitive to the specific values of strength and range .",
    "physical arguments can be made to estimate their values _",
    "a priori_. alternatively , the parameters can be adjusted so that the theory produces essentially perfect agreement between its predictions and the results of a few representative simulation calculations",
    ". a non - zero value of @xmath39 is needed to capture the wide breadth of the crossover from small- to large - length scale behaviors , e.g. , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : solvationscaling ] .    a subtlety in these formulas concerns the form of @xmath42 .",
    "when @xmath5 is not a constant , this variance is not simply the liquid phase function given in eq .   of lecture  two .",

    "if the excluded volume @xmath27 is not much larger than the correlation volume of the unperturbed liquid , @xmath45 , or if it is composed of several distantly separated excluded volumes , each one not much larger than a correlation volume , then @xmath31 $ ] is essentially a constant and equal to the solvation free energy of the excluded volume as given by gaussian fluctuation theory , eq .   in lecture  two .",
    "2 .   on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath27 presents a surface of low curvature extending over lengths larger than @xmath15 , then @xmath31 $ ] is no longer constant and is relatively large when @xmath46 for @xmath47 . to avoid this energetic penalty , probable configurations of the slowly varying fields",
    "will adjust to make @xmath48 within the excluded volume .",
    "as such , according to eq .  , the probability for configurations of the slowly varying field will be maximal at configurations with a liquid - vapor - like interface adjacent to the excluded volume .",
    "this latter situation is that of dewetting .",
    "regions of space where dewetting occurs is where an excluded volume @xmath27 causes the average value of @xmath5 to be zero .",
    "it occurs only for cases of sufficiently large excluded volumes .",
    "the field @xmath5 governed by eq .   is a continuum version of an ising model or lattice - gas model .",
    "we see from the theory sketched above that the underlying physics of dewetting is captured by coupling of an ising - like field to a small - length scale field through excluded volume perturbations . indeed , with a single fixed parameter the strength parameter @xmath39",
    ", the results of these equations agree quantitatively with those of computer simulations , as we have recently shown in detail in ref .",
    "varillypatelchandler2011 .      the first general theoretical treatment of dewetting in water and its role in hydrophobicity was provided by the lum - chandler - weeks ( lcw ) theory  @xcite .",

    "the simplest implementation replaces @xmath5 with a binary field on a lattice , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the bulk liquid density and @xmath56 is either 0 or 1 depending upon whether @xmath57th cell in the lattice is vapor - like or liquid - like , respectively .",

    "the @xmath63 terms account for excluded volume in liquid - like regions , with the free energy cost for this excluded to be proportional to the size of that volume .",
    "proportionality to excluded volume is approximately consistent with small - length scale hydrophobic free energies of solvation , as we explained in lecture  two .",
    "this version of the theory is particularly easy to implement . with judicious choices of lattice spacing and the constant @xmath59 , most qualitative features of dewetting and hydrophobic forces of assembly",
    "are captured correctly .",
    "the principal feature it fails to capture is the slow approach to the macroscopic surface - area scaling illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : solvationscaling ] . instead of a broad crossover from small to large - length scale hydrophobicity , this simplest version exhibits a relatively abrupt crossover around 1 nm . this deficiency can be ameliorated , as we have detailed in ref .",

    "the intra - chain forces for the chain considered in that figure are such that the extended chain is most stable configuration in the gas phase .",

    "the half - life of the extended chain in the liquid is about 1  @xmath62s .",
    "the pictured trajectory shows parts of a trajectory during the relatively short period of time when the chain passes from its metastable extended state to the stable globule state .",
