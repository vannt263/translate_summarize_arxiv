    "in a nanoscale , quasiballistic electronic structure under bias , relaxation towards a steady state can not be described by the semiclassical boltzmann transport equation @xcite , because the structure s active region is typically smaller than the carrier mean free path and efficient scattering no longer governs relaxation .",
    "rather , the nanostructure s active region behaves as an open quantum - mechanical system , @xcite exchanging particles with the reservoirs of charge ( usually referred to as leads or contacts ) . in the absence of scattering within the active region , the coupling of the active region to the contacts is the cause of its nonunitary evolution ( decoherence ) towards a nonequilibrium steady state , and the importance of this coupling has become well - recognized in quantum transport studies .",
    "the description and manipulation of the contact - induced decoherence are presently of great importance not only in quantum transport studies , @xcite but also in the theory of measurement @xcite and quantum information .",
    "@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to provide a simple description of the nonunitary evolution of a ballistic nanostructure s active region due to the injection of carriers from the contacts .",
    "carrier injection from the contacts into the active region is traditionally described by either an explicit source term , such as in the single - particle density matrix , @xcite wigner function @xcite and pauli equation @xcite transport formalisms , or via a special self - energy term in the ubiquitous nonequilibrium green s function formalism .",
    "@xcite in this work , the problem of contact - induced decoherence is treated using the open systems formalism : @xcite we start with a model interaction hamiltonian that describes the injection of carriers from the contacts , and then deduce the resulting nonunitary evolution of the active region s many - body reduced statistical operator in the markovian approximation .",
    "the following two features distinguish this paper from other recent works , @xcite in which markovian rate equations have also been derived for tunneling nanostructures :    \\(1 ) derivation of the markovian evolution is achieved by coarse graining of the exact short - time dynamics in the presence of memoryless contacts , rather than utilizing the weak - coupling and van hove limit , @xcite or the high - bias limit .",
    "@xcite namely , electron - electron interaction is typically the leading inelastic scattering mechanism in the contacts .",
    "if the contacts energy - relaxation time @xmath0 due to electron - electron scattering is sufficiently short , then on the timescales coarsened over @xmath0 , the contacts appear memoryless and the evolution of the current - limiting active region can be considered markovian .",
    "@xcite the approximation of a memoryless environment , as applied to nanostructures , will be discussed in detail in sections [ sec : decoherence in the presence of a `` memoryless '' environment ] and [ sec : model ] .",
    "\\(2 ) a model contact - active region interaction is introduced to describe the injection of carriers through the open boundaries and supplant the resonant level model .",
    "namely , for tunneling nanostructures , like a resonant - tunneling diode , it is common to adopt the resonant - level model @xcite when trying to separate the active region from the contacts : the active region is treated as a system with one or several discrete resonances .",
    "but the resonant - level model for the active region is inapplicable away from the resonances , and can not , for instance , capture the current increase in a resonant - tunneling diode at high biases ( larger than the valley bias ) that is due to the continuum states . also , it is not a good model for simple structures without resonances , such as an @xmath1 diode or the channel of a mosfet .",
    "so we introduce an alternative model hamiltonian that does not assume resonances _ a priori _ exist and that works both near and far from resonances .",
    "it captures the open boundaries and naturally continuous spectrum of a nanostructure s active region , and describes carrier injection in a manner conceptually similar to the explicit source terms in the single - particle density matrix or wigner function techniques .",

    "[ sec : coarse graining ] , we then perform coarse - graining of the exact non - markovian short - time dynamics of an abstract open system ( details of the derivation of the exact short - time dynamics are given in appendix a ) over the memory loss time of the environment in order to obtain a markovian map , and we discuss the necessary conditions for this procedure to hold . in sec .",

    "the reason is that , in the most common approximation of initially decoupled @xmath2 and @xmath3 , described by @xmath29 , the projection operator induced by @xmath28 will eliminate a certain memory term occurring in the evolution of @xmath19 . however , the result for the final dynamics must not depend on the projection operator used , as projection operators are , after all , only auxiliary quantities . in this paper",

    "@xcite on the other hand , a markovian approximation to the exact dynamics can be obtained in the weak - coupling and van hove limit , as first shown by davies .",
    "@xcite although the weak coupling limit has been used previously by several authors @xcite to derive markovian rate equations for tunneling structures in the resonant - level model , this approximation is not generally applicable for nanostructures .",
    "@xcite    the point we wish to make here is that the markovian approximation to the long - time evolution of nanostructures can be justified more broadly , by employing _ the approximation of a memoryless environment _ for the contacts .",
    "consider first the active region of a small semiconductor device ; a good example is the state - of - the art mosfet with 45 nm lithographic gate length ( physical gate length is estimated to be around 20 nm ) , found in intel s 2008 penryn processors .",
    "@xcite semiconductor devices are generally required to operate at ( or at least near ) room temperature , where phonons are abundant . however , due to the active region s minuscule dimensions , scattering happens infrequently , so the active region does feature quasiballistic transport , where scattering can be added as a perturbation to the ballistic solution .",
    "the bulk - like contacts of semiconductor devices are typically heavily doped ( e.g. , @xmath95 in silicon ) , and at room temperature all the dopants are ionized ; at such high doping densities , electron - electron scattering dominates over phonon scattering as the leading energy - relaxation mechanism ( e.g. , relaxation time for electron - electron scattering in bulk gaas at @xmath96 and room temperature is @xmath97 fs , @xcite whereas it is about @xmath98 fs for polar optical phonon scattering @xcite ) .",
    "basically , electron - electron scattering in the highly doped contacts of semiconductor devices ensures that the carrier distribution snaps into a distribution that can be considered a displaced ( also known as drifted ) fermi - dirac distribution @xcite ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : currentcarryingcontactsmemoryless ] ) within the energy - relaxation time @xmath99 femtoseconds @xcite ( the actual value depends on the doping density and temperature ) .",
    "this time is very short with respect to the typical response times of these devices , which is on the timescales of @xmath100 ps ( `` ar '' stands for the active region ) .",
    "therefore , for small semiconductor devices , on timescales coarsened over the energy relaxation time @xmath0 of the contacts , the contact distribution function responds virtually instantaneously , and the contacts can be considered _ memoryless _ , while the relaxation of the whole structure happens on timescales a few orders of magnitude longer .",
    "( a memoryless approximation must be applied with care to current - carrying contacts , as we will discuss in detail in [ sec : currentcarryingcontactsmemoryless ] and [ sec : lb comparison ] . )    for low - dimensional nanostructures , fabricated on a high - mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) and operating at low temperatures , the energy relaxation in the contacts is also governed by the inelastic electron - electron scattering , @xcite because the phonons are frozen ( although there are indications that acoustic phonon scattering may be important down to about 4 k @xcite ) .",
    "the near - equilibrium energy relaxation times in these contacts are much longer than in devices , falling in the wide range of @xmath101 ps , @xcite depending on the contact dimensionality ( 1d@xcite or 2d @xcite ) , carrier density , and temperature .",
    "excitations with energies higher than @xmath102 , such as when bias @xmath103 is applied across the nanostructure ( @xmath104 is the electron charge ) , relax more rapidly , @xcite which is of particular importance in the collector contact . in low - dimensional nanostructures , there are also experimental indications that coupling of the active region to the contacts governs its evolution . @xcite as for the typical response times of nanostructures , recent experiment by naser _",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated markovian relaxation in quantum point contacts on @xmath105 ns timescales at 4 k , so the ratio @xmath106 is still less than unity , but not as small as in devices .",
    "still , there is enough rationale to further explore a nanostructure s dynamics within the approximation of memoryless contacts , with the understanding that this approximation must generally be qualified , especially for nanostructures at very low temperatures .",
    "we will therefore proceed with deriving the markovian approximation to the exact non - markovian equation ( [ eq : dot rho_s uncorrelated ] ) in the presence of an environment that loses memory on a timescale @xmath0 , presumed much shorter that the response time of the open system , and we will derive the relationships that the coarse graining time @xmath0 must satisfy for the approximation to be consistent . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we will see what type of constraint that puts on our energy relaxation time in the contacts .    before proceeding with the formal development",
    ", it is worth stressing that the importance of a markovian approximation to the exact evolution is great , because with both nanoscale semiconductor devices used for digital applications and with dc experiments on nanostructures , _ one is primarily interested in the steady state _ that the structure reaches upon the application of a dc bias . in these situations ,",
    "it is sufficient to employ the markovian approximation to the evolution ( if warranted ) , as it is correct on long timescales and will result in the correct steady state .",
    "to practically obtain the markovian approximation due to an environment that loses memory after a time @xmath0 , we use the coarse - graining procedure : we can partition the time axis into intervals of length @xmath0 , @xmath107 , so the environment interacts with the system in exactly the same way during each interval @xmath108 $ ] , @xcite so @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the averaged value of the map s generator over any interval @xmath108 $ ] ( @xmath111 is reset at each @xmath112 ) . if the timescales are coarsened over @xmath0 , then the term on the left of ( [ eq : difference rho_s ] ) approximates the first derivative at @xmath112 , so the system s evolution can be described by @xmath113 the above map is completely positive and markovian ( coarse graining preserves complete positivity @xcite ) , but still has little practical value , because extracting @xmath111 explicitly from first principles is difficult .",
