    "the interest in systems undergoing reaction - diffusion processes is experiencing a rapid growth , due to their intrinsic relevance in an extraordinary broad range of fields [ 1 ] .",
    "in particular , a great deal of experimental and theoretical work has been devoted to the study of reaction - diffusion processes embedded in _",
    "restricted geometries_. this expression refers to two , possibly concurrent , situations : @xmath1 low dimensionality and _ ii . _",
    "small spatial extent .    in the first case ,",
    "the spectral dimension @xmath2 characterizing the diffusive behaviour of the reactants on the substrate is low @xmath3 , and the substrate underlying the diffusion - reaction lacks spatial homogeneity .",
    "this situation is able to model media whose properties are not translationally invariant and where the reactants perform a `` compact exploration '' [ 2 ] .",
    "these kinds of structures can lead to a chemical behaviour significantly different from those occurring on substrates displaying a homogeneous spatial arrangement . indeed , while in high dimensions a mean - field approach ( based on classical rate equations ) provides a good description , in low dimension local fluctuations are responsible for significant deviation from mean - field predictions [ 3 ] .",
    "there also exists a variety of experimental situations in which reaction - diffusion processes occur on spatial scales too small to allow an infinite volume treatment : in this case finite - size corrections to the asymptotic ( infinite - volume ) behaviour become predominant .    here",
    ", differently from previous works , we explicitly examine finite size systems , i.e. no thermodynamic limit is taken [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "all the quantities we calculate are hence finite , and we seek their dependence on the finite parameters of the system ( volume of the substrate and concentration of the reactants ) .",
    "in particular , we study the dynamics of a system made up of two species particles undergoing irreversible quadratic autocatalytic reactions @xmath0 .",
    "all particles move randomly and react upon encounter with probability @xmath4 , i.e. the reaction is strictly local and deterministic .",
    "notice that , allowing all the particles to diffuse makes the problem under study a genuine multiparticle - diffusion problem .",
    "the latter is generally quite difficult to manage due to the fact that the effects of each single particle do not combine linearly , even in the non - interacting case .",
    "for this reason the analytic treatment often relies on simplifying assumptions which , nevertheless , preserve the main generic features of the problem . in the past , autocatalytic reactions have been extensively analyzed on euclidean structures [ 7 ] , within a continuous picture attained by the fisher equation [ 8,9 ] which describes the system in terms of front propagation .",
    "evidently , this picture is not suitable for low - density systems , where front propagation can not be defined . in order to describe also the high - dilution regime , here a different approach",
    "is introduced which , as we will see , works as well for inhomogeneous structures .",
    "this way , we are also able to highlight the role of topology in the temporal evolution of the system .    in the following , we shall examine the concentration @xmath5 of @xmath6 particles present in the system at time @xmath7 and its fluctuations ; from @xmath8 it is then possible to derive an estimate for the reaction velocity .",
    "furthermore , we consider the average time @xmath9 ( also called `` final time '' ) at which the system achieves its inert state , i.e. @xmath10 . as we will show , @xmath11 depends on the number of particles @xmath12 and on the volume @xmath13 of the underlying structure .",
    "more precisely , for small concentrations of the reactants , we find , both numerically and analytically , that the @xmath11 factorizes into two terms depending on @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "one of the most interesting applications of the final time is analytic [ 10,11 ] : as we show , @xmath9 sensitively depends on the initial amount of reactant @xmath12 and , on low dimensional substrates @xmath14 , by reducing the dimension @xmath15 , the sensitivity can be further improved .",
    "we consider a system made up of @xmath12 particles of two different chemical species @xmath6 and @xmath16 , diffusing and reacting on a discrete substrate with no excluded volume effects . at time @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the number of @xmath6 and @xmath16 particles , respectively , with @xmath19 .",
    "being @xmath13 the substrate volume , we define @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the concentrations of the two species at time @xmath7 .",
    "different species particles residing at time step @xmath7 , on the same node or on nearest - neighbour nodes react according to the mechanism @xmath0 with reaction probability set equal to one .",
    "notice that the previous scheme also includes possible additional products ( other than @xmath22 ) made up of some inert species of no consequences to the overall kinetics .",
    "the initial condition at time @xmath23 is @xmath24 ( the source ) , @xmath25 , with all particles distributed randomly throughout the substrate . as a consequence of the chemical reaction defined above ,",
    "@xmath17 is a monotonic function of @xmath7 and , due to the finiteness of the system , it finally reaches value @xmath12 ; at that stage the system is chemically inert .",
    "the average time at which @xmath26 is called `` final time '' and denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the final time @xmath11 is of great experimental importance since it represents the average time when the system is inert and therefore it provides an estimate of the time when reaction - induced effects ( such as side - reactions or photoemission ) vanish [ 12 ] . in this perspective , deviations from the theoretical prediction of @xmath11 are , as well , noteworthy : they could reveal the existence of competitive reactions or explain how the process is affected by external radiation .    finally , notice that the autocatalytic reaction can also be used as a model for spreading phenomena :",
    "@xmath27 particles may stand for ( irreversibly ) sick ( healthy ) or informed ( unaware ) agents , respectively .",
    "for these systems a knowledge of the infection rate or information diffusion is of great importance [ 4,5 ] .",
    "as previously said , @xmath11 generally depends on the total number of agents @xmath12 and on the size of the lattice @xmath13 , while its functional form is affected by the topology of the lattice itself .",
    "the analytical treatment is carried out in the two limit regimes of high and low density .",
    "when @xmath28 , the substrate topology does not qualitatively affects results .",
    "we can assume that the set of @xmath6 particles covers a connected region of the substrate whose volume expands with a constant velocity ( depending on the density @xmath29 and dimension @xmath15 ) .",
    "in this case ( and exactly in the limit @xmath30 the process can be described as the deterministic propagation of a wave front decoupled from the random motion of the agents . if we suppose the source to be at the center of the lattice at time @xmath23 , at each instant the wave front is the locus of points whose chemical distance from the center is @xmath31 .",
    "the connected region spanned by the wave front is entirely occupied by @xmath6 particles , while @xmath16 particles fill the remaining of the lattice .",
    "in particular , for a @xmath15-dimensional regular substrate , the region where @xmath6 particles concentrate is a @xmath15-dimensional polyhedron [ 4,5 ] .    in general , for a finite system , the average final time is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the chemical distance of the most distant point on the lattice , starting from the source . on euclidean geometries",
    "this yields @xmath34 for d=1 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 . on the other hand , on inhomogeneous structures ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath37 is not so simple , since it involves taking the average with respect to all possible starting points for the source .      in the case of low density",
    "@xmath38 the time an @xmath6 particle walks before meeting a @xmath16 particle becomes very large , so that the process is diffusion - limited .",
    "we adopt a mean - field - like approximation by assuming that the time elapsing between a reaction and the successive one is long enough that the spatial distribution of reactants can be considered random . in other words ,",
    "the particles between each event have the time to redistribute randomly on the lattice and we neglect correlations between their spatial positions .",
    "another consequence of the low concentration of reactants , is that we can just focus on two - body interactions since the event of three or more particles interacting together is unlikely .",
    "notice that the high - dilution assumption , by itself , generally does not allow to apply the classical rate equations : when diffusion is involved also the substrate topology has to be taken into account .",
    "for this reason , in the following we will treat high and low dimensional structures separately .",
    "_ high - dimensional structures _",
    "@xmath39 let us consider a given configuration of the system where @xmath40 and @xmath41 particles are present .",
    "the probability for a given b particle to encounter and react with any a particle is just the trapping probability @xmath42 for a particle , out of @xmath41 , in the presence of @xmath40 traps , both species diffusing . under the assumptions specified above , for high - dimensional substrates [ 1 ] : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant depending on the given substrate .",
    "form the previous equation we can calculate the average trapping time for a b particle as @xmath45 .",
    "let us now introduce an early - time @xmath46 approximation for the trapping probability : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the probability that , after each reaction , two given particles first encounter at a given time ( in general , this probability depends not only on the volume of the underlying structure , but also on the history of the system ) .",
    "this simple form for @xmath49 allows us to go on straightforwardly .",
    "in fact , the process can be meant as an absorbing markov chain , with @xmath12 states ( labeled with the total number of @xmath6 particles : @xmath50 ) , and one absorbing state @xmath51 ; the chain starts from state 1 .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath52 can be written : the transition probability from a state @xmath53 to a state @xmath54 as a function of n and p is : @xmath55^{m - k}\\left [ ( 1 - p)^k \\right]^{n - m}\\ ] ] for any @xmath12 and @xmath56 . from @xmath52",
    "we can take the submatrix @xmath57 , obtained subtracting the last row and column ( those pertaining to the absorbing state ) , and compute the fundamental matrix @xmath58 .",
    "now , by expanding to first order in @xmath56 , a direct calculation shows that @xmath59 is an upper triangular matrix given by @xmath60 the mean time @xmath11 required to reach the absorbing state n , starting from state 1 is given by the sum of the first row of @xmath59 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "the last result is in perfect agreement with numerical simulations and also emphasizes @xmath11 factorization .    _",
    "low - dimensional structures _ @xmath63 .",
    "for low dimensional structures the dependence on @xmath12 found above is not correct .",
    "the reason is that a non - linear cooperative behaviour among particles emerges .",
    "let us define @xmath64 as the average time elapsing between the @xmath65-th first encounter among different particles and the @xmath66-th one .",
    "this time just corresponds to the average time during which there are just @xmath67 particles in the system . in our approximation",
    "@xmath64 is proportional to the trapping time @xmath68 in the presence of n mobile traps diffusing throughout a volume @xmath13 [ 6 ] . for compact exploration of the space @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "this result was derived for infinite lattices , nonetheless , it provides a good approximation also for finite lattices , provided that the time to encounter is not too large . from @xmath71",
    "we obtain @xmath64 as the average trapping time of the first out of @xmath72 particles , that , for rare events , is just @xmath73 with logarithmic corrections in the case @xmath74 .",
    "the time @xmath11 can therefore be written as a sum over @xmath66 @xmath75 of @xmath64 .",
    "now , by adopting a continuous approximation , we obtain for @xmath76 [ 6 ] : @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the harmonic number .",
    "in particular , the leading - order contribution for a one - dimensional system @xmath79 is @xmath80    for a two - dimensional lattice @xmath81 @xmath82 notice that the factorization in eq.([eq3 ] ) is consistent with eq.([eq1 ] ) : in both cases , the factor containing the dependence on @xmath13 represents the average time for two particles to meet .",

    "in this section we deal with quantities depending explicitly on time @xmath7 .",
    "first of all , we consider the concentration @xmath96 of @xmath6 particles present at time t. due to the irreversibility of the reaction taken into account , @xmath96 is a monotonic increasing function ; more precisely it is described by a sigmoidal law , typical of autocatalytic phenomena [ 7 ] .    as shown in fig.4 the curves @xmath17 grow faster , and saturate earlier , with increasing @xmath2 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 being fixed ) .",
    "this is consistent with the meaning of the spectral dimension @xmath2 : it describes the long - range connectivity structure of the substrate and the long - time diffusive behaviour of a random walker on the substrate .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath97 , the number of different sites visited by each walker grows faster as @xmath2 increases , and analogously the number of meetings between walkers .    for @xmath98 ( e.g. , @xmath99 in the figure ) ,",
    "@xmath17 is independent of @xmath2 and is fitted by a pure sigmoidal function .",
    "also notice that deviations between curves relevant to different topologies are especially important at early - times , while at long times they all agree with the pure sigmoidal curve .",
    "this result is consistent with the existence of two temporal regimes concerning diffusion on low - dimensional structures [ 1 ] . as a result ,",
    "the topology of the underlying structure is important only at early times , while , at long times , the system evolves as expected for high - dimensional structures .",
