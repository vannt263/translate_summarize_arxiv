    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is characterized both by _ primary _ anisotropies , imprinted at the last scattering surface at redshift @xmath5 , and by _ secondary _ anisotropies caused along the way to us by density inhomogeneities and re - scattering off electrons that are freed during the epoch of reionization , and heated to high temperature when massive structures virialize .",
    "on one hand , the primary cmb anisotropies give direct insight into the structure of the very early universe , and are one of the principal pillars on which the standard cosmological @xmath6cdm model is founded .",
    "the temperature anisotropy power spectrum has now been measured to very high precision ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yielding tight constraints on the basic parameters of the cosmological model .",
    "on the other hand , one of the most important mechanisms that can generate secondary anisotropies is the weak gravitational lensing of the cmb , which arises from the distortions induced in the geodesics of cmb photons by gradients in the gravitational matter potential @xcite .",
    "the remapping of points produced by lensing induces non - gaussianities in the observed cmb sky , and also changes the power spectra of the perturbations .",
    "the cmb is also expected to be polarized at the @xmath7% level principally because of thomson scattering of photons off free electrons during recombination .",
    "thomson scattering generates linear polarization only , which is usually expressed in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "they can in turn be decomposed into coordinate independent @xmath10- and @xmath11-modes of polarization with opposite parities , the so - called `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' types of polarization . to linear order in perturbation theory , primordial scalar ( density ) perturbations can only generate @xmath10-polarization , while primordial vector and tensor ( gravitational waves ) perturbations can generate both scalar @xmath10- and pseudoscalar @xmath11-polarization .",
    "in particular , _ primary _ b - mode polarization represents the imprints left from the primordial gravitational waves ( gws ) on the cmb @xcite : if initial fluctuations are created very early , e.g.  during inflation so that the vector growth is damped , primary b - modes are produced only by tensor perturbations that , being damped at last scattering by the horizon entering , produce the largest amount of temperature quadrupole anisotropy and , consequently , by thomson scattering , the largest amount of polarization .",
    "the primordial gravitational radiation is thought to have been generated by quantum fluctuations of the metric tensor during the inflationary era , with a strain amplitude proportional to the square of the inflation energy scale .",
    "consequently , the indirect detection of this relic gravitational background via the direct observation of the primary b - mode polarization , as expected from future dedicated cmb missions by esa and nasa , will shed light on the physics of the very early universe and will represent a powerful magnifier on the inflationary era and the very first moments in the existence of the universe .",
    "however , as for the cmb temperature , there are mechanisms also for the polarization that can produce _ secondary _ b - modes , with the dominant one being again gravitational lensing , i.e. _ cosmic shear _ ( cs ) , which distorts the primary cmb pattern , in particular converting e- into b - polarization , even in case of absence of primary b - modes .",
    "although comparable , b - modes from primordial gws exhibit their peak at multipoles @xmath12 , corresponding to the degree scale , while , for lensed b - modes , the peak is at @xmath13 , corresponding to the arcminute scale . nonetheless , if the energy scale of inflation is @xmath14gev , the cs - induced curl represents a foreground for the @xmath15 primordial gw - induced primary b - polarization @xcite",
    "this could limit the extraction of the gravity wave signal if not taken into account correctly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even though forthcoming cmb probes will have in principle the sensitivity and the instrumental performance for the detection of the cmb anisotropies in total intensity and polarization .    a precise knowledge of the lensing effects would also provide new insights and constraints on the expansion history of the universe , on the process of cosmological structure formation @xcite and on the cosmological parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a correct interpretation of the data from the forthcoming planck satellite , it will be absolutely essential to understand and model the cmb lensing , as the satellite has the sensitivity for measuring the cmb lensing with good accuracy .",
    "we note that a first detection of cmb lensing in data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) combined with complementary data has already been claimed by @xcite and @xcite , and evidence for weak gravitational lensing of the cmb has been observed at @xmath163-sigma significance by @xcite .    from the arguments above",
    "it follows that the next generation cmb experiments will require a detailed lensing reconstruction and an accurate de - lensing methodology .",
    "one can try to reconstruct the gravitational lensing effects using the so - called quadratic and maximum - likelihood estimators , which allow to reproduce at some level of precision the lensing potential from the observed cmb itself , and to invert the photon geodesic remapping induced by the cosmic shear .",
    "up to now these methodologies have been applied only to limited patches of sky @xcite and/or under the hypothesis of a gaussian distribution of the lensing sources ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . however , this is only a first order approximation , since the non - linear evolution of the cosmic structures induces non - gaussian features in the lensing potential , features that in turn have an impact on the non - gaussian statistic of the cmb produced by the point remapping caused by the cosmic shear itself on the cmb fluctuation pattern .",
    "it is thus very interesting to test the performance of these estimators on full - sky , lensed cmb maps which do include the effects of the non - linear structure evolution at all the orders .",
    "this demands detailed simulated lensed cmb maps .",
    "the increasing availability of high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations in large periodic volumes makes it possible to directly simulate the cmb distortions caused by weak lensing using realistic cosmological structure formation calculations .",
    "our previous work @xcite represents a first step into this direction . indeed",
    ", existing studies already give access to statistical properties of the expected all - sky cmb lensing signal ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but these studies are based on ` semi - analytic ' calculations that use approximate parameterizations of the non - linear evolution of the matter power spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "up to now @xmath0-body numerical simulations have been used to lens the cmb only in limited patches of sky , or to produce full - sky convergence maps confined to low redshifts @xmath17 @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we have developed and described a procedure which gives access to the full statistics of the lensed cmb signal , including non - linear and non - gaussian effects on the full - sky .",
    "this should allow improvements in the methods for separating the different contributions to cmb anisotropies in the data , which would help substantially to uncover all the cosmological information in the forthcoming observations .",
    "in this paper we apply the methodology developed in @xcite to the construction of all - sky , lensed simulated temperature and polarization maps . in section  2",
    "we describe the procedure utilized to lens , which is based on the simulated lensing potential and deflection angle templates obtained in @xcite . in section  3 we describe the resulting simulated lensed maps . in section  4 and section  5",
    "we apply statistical analyses to the obtained temperature and polarization lensed maps showing consistency and possible differences with respect to semi - analytical expectations . finally in section  6 we draw the conclusions of this work and outline next steps and future applications .    .",

    "the displacement of the points is determined by the integral of the gravitational potential along the line of sight to the last scattering surface , as we review below .    in what follows",
    "we will consider only the _ small - angle scattering _ limit ,  the case where the _ change _ in the comoving separation of cmb light - rays , owing to the deflection caused by gravitational lensing from matter inhomogeneities , is small compared to the comoving separation between the _ undeflected _ rays . in this case",

    "we assume @xmath30 to be constant between @xmath20 and @xmath19 , consistent with the born approximation .    if the gravitational potential @xmath27 is gaussian , so is the lensing potential . however , the lensed cmb is non - gaussian , as it is a second order cosmological effect produced by cosmological perturbations onto cmb anisotropies , yielding a finite correlation between different scales and thus non - gaussianity .",
    "this is expected to be most important on small scales , due to the non - linearity already present in the underlying properties of lenses .    in order to generate full - sky @xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 maps lensed by the matter distribution of the millennium simulation",
    ", we have modified the publicly available lenspix code ( lp ) , which is described in @xcite . in its original version ,",
    "in fact , this code lenses the primary cmb intensity and polarization fields via a gaussian realization , in the spherical harmonic domain , of the lensing potential power spectrum as extracted from the publicly available code for anisotropies in the microwave background ( camb ) . our modification ( hereafter referred to as `` ms - modified - lp '' )",
    "consists in forcing lp to deflect the cmb photons using the fully non - linear and non - gaussian lensing potential realization obtained from the ms using the procedure briefly summarized here , which was presented by @xcite ; we refer the reader to that paper for more detail .",

    "our map - making procedure is based on ray - tracing of the cmb photons in the born approximation through the three - dimensional field of the ms peculiar gravitational potential . in order to produce mock lensing potential maps that cover the past light - cone over the full sky",
    ", we stack the peculiar gravitational potential grids around the observer ( which is located at @xmath38 ) , exploiting the pre - computed and stored snapshots of the simulation .",
    "the spacing of the time outputs of the ms simulation is such that it corresponds to an average distance of @xmath39 ( comoving ) on the past light - cone .",
    "we fully exploit this time resolution which , at high accuracy , allows to avoid the adoption of time interpolation techniques , and use all the 63 outputs of the simulation along our integration paths . in practice",
    "this means that the data corresponding to a particular output time is utilized in a spherical shell of average thickness @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the total volume around the observer up to @xmath40 is divided into spherical shells , each of thickness @xmath41 .",
    "all the ms boxes falling into the same shell are translated and rotated with the same random vectors generating a homogeneous coordinate transformation throughout the shell , while the randomization vectors change from shell to shell .",
    "the peculiar gravitational potential at each point along a ray in direction @xmath42 is spatially interpolated from the pre - computed ms grid which possesses a spatial resolution of about @xmath43 .",
    "the deflection angle is computed along the line of sight as well , by numerically evaluating the gravitational potential gradient and interpolating at each point along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "being repeated on scales larger than the box size , the resulting weak lensing distortion lacks large scale power , which manifests itself in the lensing potential power spectrum as an evident loss of large scale power with respect to semi - analytic expectations , which is most noticeable for multipoles smaller than @xmath44 .",
    "this has been cured by augmenting large scale power ( ls - adding ) directly in the angular domain , a procedure which we exploit here as well .",

    "we have again split the spherical harmonics domain into two multipole ranges : @xmath45 , where the ms fails in reproducing the correct lensing potential power due to the limited box - size of the simulation , and @xmath46 , where instead the power spectrum is reproduced correctly by the millennium simulation ( see fig .",
    "[ projpot_ps ] ) . on the latter interval of multipoles ,",
    "we have extracted the corresponding ensemble @xmath47 of lensing - potential spherical harmonic coefficients produced by the ms lens distribution .",
    "we have modified the lenspix code so that it reads and uses these ms harmonic coefficients on the corresponding range of multipoles . on the interval @xmath48 , instead , we let lenspix generate its own ensemble of spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath49 , which are a realization of a gaussian random field characterised by the camb semi - analytic lensing - potential power spectrum ( including the estimate of the contribution from non - linearity * ? ? ?",
    "* ) inserted as input in the parameter file of lp .    since on low multipoles the effects of the non - gaussianity from the non - linear scales are negligible and the @xmath50 are independent , every time that we run the ms - modified - lp , we generate a joined ensemble of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 for @xmath48 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "this technique achieves two goals : firstly it reproduces correctly the non - linear and non - gaussian effects of the ms non - linear dark matter distribution on multipoles @xmath54 , including at the same time the contribution from the large scales at @xmath55 , where the lensing potential follows mostly the linear trend as shown from the light - green dot - dashed line in fig .",

    "in fact , as it happens for the semi - analytic contribution to the lensing - potential , also the primary temperature and polarization fields are generated by lp as gaussian realizations , in the harmonic domain , of the corresponding power spectra obtained by camb , which correctly includes the contribution to the temperature from the isw effect .",

    ", we adopt the interpolation scheme described in appendix e  4 of @xcite , using a high value of the multipole @xmath60 to maximize the accuracy .",
    "this allows running the simulation several times without excessive consumption of cpu time and memory .",
    "we work under the null hypothesis that tensor modes are absent in the early universe , so that the produced b - mode polarization is due only to the power transfer from the primary scalar e - modes into the lens - induced b - modes .",

    "the subtraction of the unlensed cmb maps from the corresponding lensed cmb maps allows highlighting the dark - matter distribution which causes the gravitational deflection of the cmb photons . in the upper and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ tp_diff_maps ] we show the resulting difference temperature and polarization maps for a particular seed choice and for the ms - modified - lp case only , since the arcminute - scale differences with respect to the unmodified - lp case are not visible by the naked eye .",
    "it is worth noting how the distribution of the deflection - angle modulus ( lower panel ) reflects itself in the distribution of the temperature difference map ( upper panel ) and in the distribution of the map of the polarization modulus @xmath66 ( middle panel ) , which has been obtained from the difference @xmath8 and @xmath9 maps .",
    "unfortunately , since the primary unlensed cmb is unknown , the difference maps can not be directly observed .",
    "anyway the simulated difference maps can help to physically and visually understand how large scale correlations are imprinted on the cmb due to the large scale modes in the deflection field , and to catch effects that are not observable due to primary unlensed cmb .",
    "the temperature and polarization difference maps have the peculiarity of including all the information inferred from weak - lensing on the primary unlensed cmb .",
    "nonetheless , it is well known that the lensed @xmath11-modes of polarization are more sensitive to the non - linear evolution of the cosmic structures than the @xmath34 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes separately @xcite .",
    "the difference between the unmodified - lp and ms - modified - lp cases lies exactly at the non - linear level , since the lensing - potential realizations differ at multipoles @xmath54 in the spherical harmonic space for the two cases .",
    "moreover , from fig .  [ projpot_ps ]",
    ", we observe that the ms lensing potential shows an excess of power on @xmath67 with respect to the camb approximation , and , as already pointed out , the non - linear dark matter evolution may enhance the level of non - gaussianity present in the lensed cmb maps .    consequently , in order to verify if the different distributions of the lensing potential in the ms - modified - lp and unmodified - lp cases could visibly affect the lensed polarization distributions , we have constructed the full - sky maps of the scalar @xmath2 and pseudo - scalar @xmath3 potentials , which are related to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 stokes parameters as follows @xcite : @xmath68 @xmath69 where the spin - raising @xmath70 and spin - lowering @xmath71 operators on the sphere are defined as @xcite @xmath72\\sin^{-s}\\theta \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath73\\sin^s\\theta \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath74 is the spin of the function to which the operator is applied .",

    "[ nol400 ] ) which include the contribution from the primary cmb , we do not observe any substantial difference on the large scales between the two cases @xmath58 and @xmath82 , so that on large scales the lensed electric polarization appears not to be much affected by the non - linear scales in the same way as the lensed temperature is .",
    "the @xmath11 case is different since we are working with the null hypothesis of vanishing primary magnetic polarization , so that we are considering here only lens - induced @xmath11-modes .",

[ nol400 ] ) , we see that on large scales the @xmath10-mode polarization , cleaned of the primary signal , gets power from the smaller scales .",
    "in particular we see that , in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 cases , multipoles larger than @xmath80 transfer about @xmath83% of the power to the low multipoles @xmath84 , i.e. on scales large enough for the flat - sky approximation to be inadequate .",

    "in this section we perform several quantitative analyses of the obtained results .",
    "our principal aim is to test the consistency and quantify the differences between the theoretical expectations and the findings from our simulation procedure .    as a first check ,",
    "we have extracted from the corresponding maps the angular power spectra of the ms - modified - lp and unmodified - lp simulated lensed @xmath34- , @xmath10- and @xmath11-components , together with the @xmath91 lensed cross - correlation power spectrum .",
    "this is simply done with the use of anafast , adopting the correct deconvolution rules for the healpix pixel window functions , and with eqs .",
    "( [ psie_lm])-([psib_lm ] ) relating the spherical harmonic coefficients of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 potentials to the corresponding coefficients of the @xmath10- and @xmath11-modes .",
    "we have also checked that the ms - modified - lp and unmodified - lp simulated spectra extracted directly from the maps agree with the ones obtained as direct outputs of the ms - modified - lp and unmodified - lp codes , respectively . moreover , to test the accuracy , we have compared all the angular power spectra with the lensed cmb power spectra obtained using the all - sky correlation function technique implemented in camb .",
    "these angular power spectra are shown in the upper panels of figs .",
    "[ tt_ps]-[te_ps ] respectively , together with the camb unlensed and the linearly lensed spectra , where the latter are obtained in the linear approximation of the cosmic structure growth .",
    "moreover , in the lower panels of the same figures we show the ratios between the simulated lensed cmb angular spectra with respect to the corresponding linear signal .    in the @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath91 cases ,",
    "it is clearly visible that cmb lensing smears out the acoustic peaks by transferring power from larger to smaller scales .",
    "moreover , since we are working under the null hypothesis of vanishing intrinsic tensor modes , fig .",
    "[ bb_ps ] represents the power spectrum of the lens - induced @xmath11-modes into which part of the primary @xmath10-modes has been converted as a result of the displacements and distortions induced from the gravitational deflection onto the electric - type polarization field .    as figs .",
    "[ tt_ps ] , [ ee_ps ] and [ te_ps ] show , for all the lensed @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath91 angular spectra , and for all multipole orders up to @xmath94 , we observe a mostly perfect agreement between the ms - modified - lp simulated signals and the unmodified - lp and camb ones , where the non - linear structure evolution is semi - analytically taken into account . on the very large multipoles @xmath95 , a small difference appears between the camb and unmodified - lp lensed @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath91 spectra , probably due to a numerical effect deriving from the different computational machinery implemented in camb and lenspix respectively .",
    "the non - linear effects start to be important at @xmath67 , according to the semi - analytical expectations , and , on multipoles @xmath96 , which correspond to angular scales of few arcminutes , they grow up to @xmath9720% for the lensed temperature and up to @xmath9710% for the lensed electric polarization .",
    "moreover , the excess of power present in the ms lensing - potential power spectrum at multipoles @xmath98 ( see fig .  [ projpot_ps ] ) manifests itself as a slight excess of power in the ms - modified - lp lensed @xmath92 and @xmath93 spectra at @xmath99 .",
    "in particular , at @xmath100 , the non - linearities present in the millennium simulation produce a @xmath976% excess in the lensed temperature and a @xmath971.3% excess in the lensed electric polarization , with respect to the unmodified - lp case .",
    "on the other hand , the excess of power due to the ms non - linearities is much more evident in the angular power spectrum of the magnetic component ( see fig .",
    "[ bb_ps ] ) where this effect starts already at @xmath101 and grows up to @xmath9714% at @xmath100 , with respect to the unmodified - lp case .",
    "moreover , the non - linear effects , which in the lensing potential appear at @xmath102 , spread on all the scales of the lens - induced @xmath11-mode spectrum , being already of the order of @xmath977.5% on all the multipoles @xmath103 , and growing up to more than @xmath9770% at @xmath100 . as we have previously noticed , this non - linear effect on the magnetic polarization",
    "is simply explained considering that the lens - induced @xmath11-modes are very sensitive to the non - linear evolution of the cosmic structures .    for what concerns the non - linear effects , as noticed already in sec .",
    "3 , it is important to stress again that , when considering the power spectra extracted from the difference maps ( in which the primary cmb has been subtracted ) , we notice a very similar large - scale behavior between the electric and magnetic polarization , which strongly differs from the temperature trend . in order to analyse this effect ,",
    "we have produced the _",
    "linearly_-lensed @xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 maps and subtracted the unlensed field . in fig .",
    "[ linearnolinear ] we show the two cases : the ratios of the lensed @xmath34 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 spectra with respect to the corresponding spectra extracted from the linearly - lensed maps , and the same ratios extracted from the corresponding lensed and linearly - lensed _ difference _ maps . while in the first case ( top panel ) the transfer of power from small scales to large scales is only visible in the lens - induced @xmath11-mode spectrum , in the second case ( bottom panel ) this power transfer is also observable in the lensed @xmath10-mode spectrum , with the same amount of @xmath977.5% up to @xmath84 as for the lens - induced @xmath11-modes .",
    "the same does not occur to the lensed temperature even after subtracting the unlensed cmb . finally ,",
    "moving to higher multipoles , the @xmath10 and @xmath34 signals converge to the same trend , while the @xmath11 signal keeps on growing because of the non - linear power .",
    "as a second analysis , we compare the one - point probability density distributions ( pdfs ) of the lensed @xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 maps with the pdfs of gaussian distributions randomly generated using the corresponding mean and standard deviation values of the lensed maps .",
    "the pdfs of both the simulated ms - modified - lp and unmodified - lp @xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 maps do not show evidence of non - gaussian features ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ tt_pdf ] ) , and are consistent with the unlensed temperature and polarization distributions within a few per cent .",
    "this occurs thanks to the high angular resolution of our maps ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and is understandable because the main effect of cmb lensing is to transfer power among different scales , without generating new power ( and we assume that the primary unlensed cmb field has a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is well - known that the remapping induced by lensing onto the @xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 fields generates a non - gaussian signature in the lensed sky which is optimally characterized by higher order statistics as the bispectrum and trispectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the lensed cmb can be considered as a function of two fields , the unlensed sky and the lensing potential , which in first approximation can be assumed to be gaussian ( unmodified - lp case ) , even if the non - linear evolution of large - scale structures produces non - gaussian features in the distribution of the projected potential ( ms - modified - lp case ) . in particular ,",
    "the non - gaussianity associated with the large - scale structure induces non - gaussian contributions to the distribution of the lensing potential such that its @xmath104-point correlator in fourier space will be non - vanishing for some value of @xmath104 , and this , in turn , has an impact on the connected part of the @xmath104-point correlators of the lensed cmb ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "anyway , there exist also other phenomena that can produce non - gaussian effects in the lensed cmb , for instance the correlations between cmb lensing and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .    here , as a first characterization of the non - gaussianity strength produced by cmb lensing",
    ", we consider the pdfs of the _ difference _",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 maps . in this way",
    ", we subtract the unlensed gaussian sky and isolate the non - gaussian term which physically generates the non - gaussian signatures in the lensed cmb .",
    "the obtained pdf in the temperature case is showed in the lower panel of fig .  [ tt_pdf ] ( the @xmath8 and @xmath9 cases have a similar trend ) .",
    "the pdfs of the difference maps are characterized by a kurtosis excess with respect to gaussian distributions randomly generated with the same mean and standard deviation values .",
    "more precisely , averaging over different realizations , the kurtosis excess is @xmath105 for the difference @xmath34-map , @xmath106 for the difference @xmath8-map and @xmath107 for the difference @xmath9-map .",
    "actually we would expect that the excess of non - linearities in the dark - matter distribution of the millennium simulation should show up as an excess of non - gaussianity in the ms - modified - lp lensed difference @xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 maps , with respect to the unmodified - lp case .",
    "however , the one - point statistic is probably unable to capture this effect , and fig .",
    "[ tt_pdf ] shows in fact that there is not a significant difference between the unmodified - lp and ms - modified - lp cases . in this respect , we believe that a more suitable estimator should be developed in order to detect the contribution from the non - linear structure evolution to the total non - gaussian statistics of the lensed maps .",
    "we reserve this analysis for future work .",
    "we have constructed the first all - sky cmb temperature and polarization lensed maps based on a high - resolution cosmological @xmath0-body simulation , the millennium simulation .    to this purpose",
    "we have exploited the lensing potential map obtained using the map - making procedure developed in @xcite which integrates along the line - of - sight the ms dark matter structures by stacking and randomizing the simulation boxes up to @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , we have modified the lenspix code @xcite by supplying it with the spherical harmonic coefficients extracted from the ms lensing potential map and by implementing directly in the code itself the large - scale structure adding technique ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which allows to reinstate the large - scale power in the angular lensing potential that is not correctly sampled by the @xmath0-body simulation . in this way",
    "we also preserve the correct correlation between the lensing potential and the isw effect on multipoles @xmath108 in the simulated temperature anisotropies .    using our modified version of the lenspix code ,",
    "we have constructed lensed cmb simulated maps with @xmath109 million pixels and an angular resolution of @xmath110 , based on potential fields calculated on @xmath111 mesh cells from the millennium simulation .",
    "after subtraction of the unlensed maps , the corresponding lensed @xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 simulated maps reflect clearly the same large scale structure which is present in the modulus of the angular gradient of the lensing potential map ( see fig .",
    "[ tp_diff_maps ] ) .",
    "we have also constructed the maps of the scalar and pseudo - scalar potentials @xmath2 and @xmath3 which are directly related to the electric and magnetic types of polarization , respectively .",
    "their difference maps , shown in figs .",
    "[ psie_diff_maps]-[psib_diff_maps ] , present distinct degree - scale distributions in the ms - modified - lp and unmodified - lp cases ( where the latter is obtained from the unmodified lenspix code as previously explained ) , owing to the power transfer from non - linear to large scales in the lensed @xmath10 and @xmath11 fields .    as a quantitative study of the simulated maps ,",
    "we have performed power spectrum and one - point statistics analyses .",
    "we find that the lensed @xmath92 , @xmath91 , @xmath93 and @xmath112 power spectra , obtained using the ms dark matter distribution , mostly overlap with the corresponding semi - analytic expectations on a range of multipoles up to @xmath101 ( see figs .",
    "[ tt_ps]-[bb_ps ] ) .",
    "this latter result points out the effectiveness of the millennium simulation in reproducing correctly the findings of the theoretical approach .",
    "furthermore , an excess of power is observable in the ms - modified - lp case on larger multipoles , in particular for the @xmath112 spectrum .",
    "we believe that this excess originates from the accurate inclusion of non - linear power in the millennium simulation , which is present in the ms lensing potential power spectrum as well ( fig .",
    "[ projpot_ps ] ) .",
    "this outcome should be taken into account in the various delensing approaches , since these non - linear effects can have an impact on the quality of the reconstructed unlensed sky , particularly in view of the detection of primary @xmath11-modes .",
    "finally , we have derived one - point statistics both of the simulated @xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 lensed maps and of the corresponding difference maps , in the ms - modified - lp and unmodified - lp cases .",
    "the comparison of the resulting pdfs with respect to gaussian random distributions with the same mean and standard deviation does not show any statistical difference when the total lensed maps are considered . on the other hand , we find that the difference maps are characterized by a kurtosis excess .",
    "this result represents the distinctive weak - lensing effect of inducing non - gaussianity in the unlensed gaussian cmb field .",
    "this is simply explained if in first approximation we think of the lensed field as the product of two gaussian fields , i.e. the lensing potential and the primary unlensed cmb .",
    "actually , correctly speaking , the lensing potential map , derived by integration of the ms dark matter distribution , preserves an intrinsic degree of non - gaussianity due to the non - linear evolution of the cosmic structures , which at some level contributes to the non - gaussian statistics of the simulated lensed cmb . unfortunately the one - point statistic is not sufficient to disentangle the two contributions , i.e. the dominant effect coming from the product of two different fields , and the subdominant effect coming from the non - linear matter evolution .",
    "this is the reason why in fig .",
    "[ tt_pdf ] there seems to be no difference between the ms - modified - lp and unmodified - lp cases .",
    "we reserve a more accurate characterization of non - gaussianity in cmb lensing statistics to a future work .",
