    "the term @xmath75 in the formula for @xmath72 is needed in order to reproduce the average msr values obtained within the rmft .",

    "the ratio of the proton radius to the neutron radius is a smooth function of @xmath57 and @xmath76 and it could be very well described by the simple formula ( 16 ) . using this global dependence",
