    "the two key characteristics of wireless communications that most greatly impact system design and performance are 1 ) the randomly - varying channel conditions and 2 ) limited energy resources . in wireless systems ,",
    "the power of the received signal fluctuates randomly over time due to mobility , changing environment , and multipath fading .",
    "these random changes in the received signal strength lead to variations in the instantaneous data rates that can be supported by the channel @xcite .",
    "in addition , mobile wireless systems can only be equipped with limited energy resources , and hence energy efficient operation is a crucial requirement in most cases .    to measure and compare the energy efficiencies of different systems and transmission schemes , one can choose as a metric the energy required to reliably send one bit of information .",
    "information - theoretic studies show that energy - per - bit requirement is generally minimized , and hence the energy efficiency is maximized , if the system operates at low signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) levels and hence in the low - power or wideband regimes .",
    "recently , verd in @xcite has determined the minimum bit energy required for reliable communication over a general class of channels , and studied of the spectral efficiency ",
    "bit energy tradeoff in the wideband regime while also providing novel tools that are useful for analysis at low @xmath0s . in many wireless communication systems , in addition to energy - efficient operation , satisfying certain quality of service ( qos ) requirements is of paramount importance in providing acceptable performance and quality .",
    "for instance , in voice over ip ( voip ) , interactive - video ( e.g , .",
    "videoconferencing ) , and streaming - video applications in wireless systems , latency is a key qos metric and should not exceed certain levels @xcite . on the other hand , wireless channels , as described above ,",
    "are characterized by random changes in the channel , and such volatile conditions present significant challenges in providing qos guarantees . in most cases , statistical , rather than deterministic ,",
    "qos assurances can be given .",
    "in summary , it is vital for an important class of wireless systems to operate efficiently while also satisfying qos requirements ( e.g. , latency , buffer violation probability )",
    ". information theory provides the ultimate performance limits and identifies the most efficient use of resources .",
    "however , information - theoretic studies and shannon capacity formulation generally do not address delay and quality of service ( qos ) constraints @xcite .",
    "recently , wu and negi in @xcite defined the effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given time - varying service process can support while providing statistical qos guarantees .",
    "effective capacity formulation uses the large deviations theory and incorporates the statistical queueing constraints by capturing the rate of decay of the buffer occupancy probability for large queue lengths .",
    "the analysis and application of effective capacity in various settings has attracted much interest recently ( see e.g. , @xcite@xcite and references therein ) . in this paper , we study the energy efficiency in the presence of queueing constraints and channel uncertainty .",
    "we assume that the channel is not known by the transmitter and receiver prior to transmission , and is estimated imperfectly by the receiver through training . in our model",
    ", we incorporate statistical queueing constraints by employing the effective capacity formulation which provides the maximum throughput under limitations on buffer violation probabilities for large buffer sizes .",
    "since the transmitter is assumed to not know the channel , fixed - rate transmission is considered .",
    "we consider a point - to - point wireless link in which there is one source and one destination .",
    "it is assumed that the source generates data sequences which are divided into frames of duration @xmath1 .",
    "these data frames are initially stored in the buffer before they are transmitted over the wireless channel .",
    "the discrete - time channel input - output relation in the @xmath2 symbol duration is given by @xmath3 = h[i ] x[i ] + n[i ] \\quad i = 1,2,\\ldots.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] denote the complex - valued channel input and output , respectively .",
    "we assume that the bandwidth available in the system is @xmath6 and the channel input is subject to the following average energy constraint : @xmath7|^2\\}\\le { \\bar{p}}/ b$ ] for all @xmath8 .",
    "since the bandwidth is @xmath6 , symbol rate is assumed to be @xmath6 complex symbols per second , indicating that the average power of the system is constrained by @xmath9 . above in ( [ eq : model ] ) , @xmath10 $ ] is a zero - mean , circularly symmetric , complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath11|^2\\ } = n_0 $ ] .",
    "the additive gaussian noise samples @xmath12\\}$ ] are assumed to form an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) sequence .",
    "finally , @xmath13 $ ] , which denotes the channel fading coefficient , is assumed to be a zero - mean gaussian random variable with variance @xmath14 .",
    "we further assume that the fading coefficients stay constant during the frame duration of @xmath1 seconds and have independent realizations for each frame .",
    "hence , we basically consider a block - fading channel model .",
    "we also note that neither the transmitter not the receiver has channel side information prior to transmission .",
    "the system operates in two phases : training phase and data transmission phase . in the training phase ,",
    "known pilot symbols are transmitted to enable the receiver to estimate the channel conditions , albeit imperfectly .",
    "we assume that minimum mean - square - error ( mmse ) estimation is employed at the receiver to estimate the channel coefficient @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "since the mmse estimate depends only on the training energy and not on the training duration @xcite , it can be easily seen that transmission of a single pilot at every @xmath1 seconds is optimal .",
    "note that in every frame duration of @xmath1 seconds , we have @xmath15 symbols and the overall available energy is @xmath16 .",
    "we now assume that each frame consists of a pilot symbol and @xmath17 data symbols .",
    "the energies of the pilot and data symbols are @xmath18 respectively , where @xmath19 is the fraction of total energy allocated to training .",
    "note that the data symbol energy @xmath20 is obtained by uniformly allocating the remaining energy among the data symbols .    in the training phase",
    ", the receiver obtains the mmse estimate @xmath21 which is a circularly symmetric , complex , gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23@xcite .",
    "now , the channel fading coefficient @xmath24 can be expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the estimate error and @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , in the data transmission phase , the channel input - output relation becomes @xmath28 = \\hat{h}[i ] x[i ] + \\tilde{h}[i ] x[i ] + n[i ] \\quad i = 1,2,\\ldots.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] since finding the capacity of the channel in ( [ eq : impmodel ] ) is a difficult task - dependent , discrete distribution with a finite number of mass points . in such cases ,",
    "no closed - form expression for the capacity exists , and capacity values need to be obtained through numerical computations . ] , a capacity lower bound is generally obtained by considering the estimate error @xmath26 as another source of gaussian noise and treating @xmath29 x[i ] + n[i]$ ] as gaussian distributed noise uncorrelated from the input .",
    "now , the new noise variance is @xmath30 x[i ] + n[i]|^2\\ } = \\sigma_{\\tilde{h}}^2 { \\mathcal{e}}_s + n_0 $ ] where @xmath31 is the variance of the estimate error . under these assumptions , a lower bound on the instantaneous capacity",
    "is given by @xcite , @xcite @xmath32 where effective @xmath0 is @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the variance of estimate @xmath21 .",
    "note that the expression in ( [ eq : traincap2 ] ) is obtained by defining @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a standard complex gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "since gaussian is the worst uncorrelated noise @xcite , the above - mentioned assumptions lead to a pessimistic model and the rate expression in ( [ eq : traincap2 ] ) is a lower bound to the capacity of the true channel ( [ eq : impmodel ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath38 is a good measure of the rates achieved in communication systems that operate as if the channel estimate were perfect ( i.e. , in systems where gaussian codebooks designed for known channels are used , and scaled nearest neighbor decoding is employed at the receiver ) @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we base our analysis on @xmath38 to understand the impact of the imperfect channel estimate .",
    "since the transmitter is unaware of the channel conditions , it is assumed that information is transmitted at a fixed rate of @xmath39 bits / s . when @xmath40 , the channel is considered to be in the on state and reliable communication",
    "is achieved at this rate .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath41 , we assume that outage occurs . in this case , channel is in the off state and reliable communication at the rate of @xmath39 bits / s can not be attained . hence",
    ", effective data rate is zero and information has to be resent .",
    "[ fig:00 ] depicts the two - state transmission model together with the transition probabilities . under the block",
    "fading assumption , it can be easily seen that the transition probabilities are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is an exponential random variable with mean @xmath45 , and hence , @xmath46 .",
    "in @xcite , wu and negi defined the effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given service process can support in order to guarantee a statistical qos requirement specified by the qos exponent @xmath47 .",
    "if we define @xmath48 as the stationary queue length , then @xmath47 is the decay rate of the tail distribution of the queue length @xmath48 : @xmath49 therefore , for large @xmath50 , we have the following approximation for the buffer violation probability : @xmath51 .",
    "hence , while larger @xmath47 corresponds to more strict qos constraints , smaller @xmath47 implies looser qos guarantees .",
    "similarly , if @xmath52 denotes the steady - state delay experienced in the buffer , then @xmath53 for large @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is determined by the arrival and service processes @xcite .",
    "the effective capacity is given by @xmath56}\\}}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 = \\sum_{i=1}^{t}r[i]$ ] is the time - accumulated service process and @xmath58 , i=1,2,\\ldots\\}$ ] denote the discrete - time stationary and ergodic stochastic service process .",
    "note that in the model we consider , @xmath59 = rt \\text { or } 0 $ ] depending on the channel state being on or off . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that for such an on - off model , we have @xmath60 note that @xmath61 in our model .",
    "then , for a given qos delay constraint @xmath47 , the effective capacity normalized by the frame duration @xmath1 and bandwidth @xmath6 , or equivalently spectral efficiency in bits / s / hz , becomes @xmath62 @xmath63 note that @xmath64 is obtained by optimizing both the fixed transmission rate @xmath39 and the fraction of power allocated to training , @xmath19 . in the optimization result ( [ eq : trainopti2 ] ) , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the optimal values of @xmath39 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "it can easily be seen that @xmath68 hence , as the qos requirements relax , the maximum constant arrival rate approaches the average transmission rate . on the other hand , for @xmath69 , @xmath70 in order to avoid violations of buffer constraints .    in this paper , we focus on the energy efficiency of wireless transmissions under the aforementioned statistical queueing constraints .",
    "since energy efficient operation generally requires operation at low-@xmath0 levels , our analysis throughout the paper is carried out in the low-@xmath0 regime . in this regime ,",
    "the tradeoff between the normalized effective capacity ( i.e , spectral efficiency ) @xmath64 and bit energy @xmath71 is a key tradeoff in understanding the energy efficiency , and is characterized by the bit energy at zero spectral efficiency and wideband slope provided , respectively , by @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the first and second derivatives with respect to @xmath0 , respectively , of the function @xmath75 at zero @xmath0 @xcite . @xmath76 and @xmath77 provide a linear approximation of the spectral efficiency curve at low spectral efficiencies .",
    "in this section , we investigate the optimization problem in ( [ eq : trainopti ] ) .",
    "in particular , we identify the optimal fraction of power that needs to be allocated to training while satisfying statistical buffer constraints .",
    "[ theo : optrho ] at a given @xmath0 level , the optimal fraction of power @xmath78 that solves ( [ eq : trainopti ] ) does not depend on the qos exponent @xmath47 and the transmission rate @xmath39 , and is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "_ proof : _ from ( [ eq : trainopti ] ) and the definition of @xmath67 in ( [ eq : trainthresh ] ) , we can easily see that for fixed @xmath39 , the only term in ( [ eq : trainopti ] ) that depends on @xmath19 is @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , @xmath67 has this dependency through @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , @xmath78 that maximizes the objective function in ( [ eq : trainopti ] ) can be found by minimizing @xmath67 , or equivalently maximizing @xmath82 . substituting the definitions in ( [ eq : trainpower ] ) and the expressions for @xmath83 and @xmath84 into",
    "( [ eq : trainsnr ] ) , we have @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "evaluating the derivative of @xmath82 with respect to @xmath19 and making it equal to zero leads to the expression in ( [ eq : optrho ] ) . clearly , @xmath78 is independent of @xmath47 and @xmath39 .",
    "above , we have implicitly assumed that the maximization is performed with respect to first @xmath19 and then @xmath39 .",
    "however , the result will not alter if the order of the maximization is changed .",
    "note that the objective function in ( [ eq : trainopti ] ) @xmath87 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath82 for all @xmath39 .",
    "it can be easily verified that maximization does not affect the monotonicity of @xmath88 , and hence @xmath89 is still a monotonically increasing function of @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , in the outer maximization with respect to @xmath19 , the choice of @xmath19 that maximizes @xmath82 will also maximize @xmath90 , and the optimal value of @xmath19 is again given by ( [ eq : optrho ] ) . @xmath91",
    "in this section , we investigate the spectral efficiency  bit energy tradeoff as the average power @xmath9 diminishes .",
    "we assume that the bandwidth allocated to the channel is fixed . with the optimal value of @xmath19 given in theorem [ theo : optrho ]",
    ", we can now express the normalized effective capacity as @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 note that @xmath95 vanishes with decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "we obtain the following result on the bit energy requirement in the low - power regime as @xmath9 diminishes .",
    "[ theo : imperfect ] in the low - power regime , the bit energy increases without bound as the average power @xmath9 and hence @xmath0 vanishes , i.e. , @xmath96    this result shows us that operation at very low power levels is extremely energy inefficient and should be avoided regardless of the value of @xmath47 . note that the power allocated for training , @xmath97 , decreases with decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "hence , our ability to estimate the channel is hindered in the low - power regime while , as mentioned before , the system operates as if the channel estimate were perfect .",
    "this discrepancy leads to the inefficiency seen as @xmath9 approaches zero .",
    "[ fig:6 ] plots the spectral efficiency vs. bit energy for @xmath98 when @xmath99 hz . as predicted by the result of theorem [ theo : imperfect ] , the bit energy increases without bound in all cases as the spectral efficiency @xmath100 .",
    "consequently , the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero spectral efficiency below which one should avoid operating as it only increases the energy requirements .",
    "another observation is that the minimum bit energy increases as @xmath47 increases and hence as the statistical queueing constraints become more stringent . at higher spectral efficiencies ,",
    "we again note the increased energy requirements with increasing @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebsnr ] , we plot @xmath101 as a function of @xmath0 for different bandwidth levels assuming @xmath102 .",
    "similarly , we observe that the minimum bit energy is attained at a nonzero @xmath0 value below which @xmath101 requirements start increasing .",
    "furthermore , we see that as the bandwidth increases , the minimum bit energy tends to decrease and is achieved at a lower @xmath0 level .     in the rayleigh channel with @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath99 . ]",
    "vs. @xmath0 in the rayleigh channel .",
    "@xmath103 , @xmath47=0.01 . ]    in this section , we consider the wideband regime in which the bandwidth is large .",
    "we assume that the average power @xmath9 is kept constant .",
    "note that as the bandwidth @xmath6 increases , @xmath104 approaches zero and we again operate in the low-@xmath0 regime .",
    "we denote @xmath105 .",
    "note that as @xmath106 , we have @xmath107 . with this notation",
    ", we can express the normalized effective capacity as @xmath108    the following result provides the expressions for the bit energy at zero spectral efficiency ( i.e. , as @xmath109 ) and the wideband slope , and characterize the spectral efficiency - bit energy tradeoff in the wideband regime .",
    "[ theo : wideband ] in the wideband regime , the minimum bit energy and wideband slope are given by @xmath110 respectively , where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",

    "this is in stark contrast to the results in the low - power regime in which the bit energy requirements grow without bound as @xmath9 and @xmath0 vanishes . in the model we have considered ,",
    "the difference in the performance can be attributed to the fact that increase in the bandwidth , while lowering symbol power @xmath118 , does not necessarily decrease the training power @xmath119 .",
    "[ fig : trainwb ] plots the spectral efficiency  bit energy curve in the rayleigh channel for different @xmath47 values . in the figure",
