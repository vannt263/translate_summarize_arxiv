    "we envisage the possibility of the occurrence of a bose - einstein condensation in dense boson media of identical bosons with the following reasoning @xcite    1 .",
    "identical bosons with mutual attractive interaction generate a mean field potential , which depends on the boson density @xmath3 as @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the forward scattering amplitude , and @xmath6 is the length scale that defines the spatial region of boson occupation .",

    "a greater condensate fraction @xmath12 brings about a greater coherence in bose - einstein correlations and a reduction in the degree of chaoticity .    in high energy heavy - ion collisions when",
    "bosons ( gluons or pions ) are copiously produced within a small region in a short time interval , the density of the bosons increases as the collision energy increases . following the above reasoning , generalized to systems with differential transverse and longitudinal spatial distributions",
    ", we expect the occurrence of boson condensation in high energy heavy - ion collisions at some high collision energies .",
    "it is useful to examine the bose - einstein condensation for bosons in an exactly solvable model .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath14 bosons in a spherical harmonic oscillator potential , which arises either externally or from the bosons own mean - fields .",
    "we study how the occupation numbers of different states change as a function of the temperature @xmath10 , in relation to the oscillator frequency @xmath7 .",
    "bose - einstein condensation occurs when the occupation number @xmath15 for the lowest state ( the condensate state ) is a substantial fraction of the total particle number @xmath14 . the degree of coherence or chaoticity is quantified by the condensate fraction @xmath16 , which varies as a function of the order parameter @xmath9 .",
    "in such a study , it is important to use the proper statistical ensemble @xcite . in a grand canonical ensemble , we fix the chemical potential @xmath17 and the temperature @xmath10 , and we allow the number of particles @xmath18 in the @xmath19-th single - particle state to vary .",
