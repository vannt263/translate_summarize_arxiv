    "production , control and detection of spin polarized current through nanostructures ( _ spintronics_)@xcite has become an area of intense activity in the past few years .",
    "this is mostly due to the long coherence times of spins , as compared to charge , giving rise to possible applications in quantum information processing .",
    "proposals for generating spin - polarized currents include spin injection by using ferromagnetic metals @xcite or magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may use quantum dots ( qds ) as spin filters or spin pumps @xcite . in a semiconductor",
    "qd , the number of electrons can be controlled via gate voltages , making it an ideal system to study transport of individual electrons and probe the structure and properties of the discrete energy level spectrum .",
    "indeed , the spin of an isolated electron in a qd has been proposed as a quantum bit for transport of quantum information . for qd spin filters , dc transport through few electron states",
    "is used to obtain spin - polarized currents which are almost 100% spin - polarized as demonstrated experimentally by hanson _",
    "et al _ @xcite following the proposal of recher _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the basic principle of spin pumps is closely related to that of charge pumps . in a charge pump a dc current is generated by combining ac driving with either absence of inversion symmetry in the device , or lack of time - reversal symmetry in the ac signal .",
    "the range of possible pumps includes turnstiles @xcite , adiabatic pumps or non - adiabatic pumps based on photon - assisted tunneling ( pat ) @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", the application of ac electric fields in quantum dots has shown to be very accurate both to control and to modify their transport and electronic properties@xcite .",
    "for instance , sun et al.@xcite have proposed a spin cell based on a double quantum dot ( dqd ) driven by microwave radiation in the presence of an external _ non - uniform _ magnetic field .",
    "for strongly correlated electrons in quantum dots in the kondo regime , the application of an ac potential has been shown to induce decoherence and destroy the kondo peak@xcite .",
    "an ac potential modifies as well the electron dynamics within single and double quantum dots and it has been shown that under certain conditions it induces charge localization and destroys the tunneling , allowing , by tuning the parameters of the ac field , to control the time evolution of the state occupation , and therefore the entanglement character of the electronic wave function@xcite .",
    "regarding detection of single spin states in semiconductor quantum dots , this has been achieved@xcite using quantum point contacts and spin to charge conversion .",
    "these studies allow determination of spin relaxation times on the order of milliseconds .",
    "recently , we proposed a new scheme for realizing _ both _ spin filtering and spin pumping in an ac - driven dqd ( pat regime ) , in the coulomb blockade transport regime , by tuning the parameters of the ac field@xcite .",
    "we considered an asymmetric dqd system with one energy state in the left dot and two orbital states in the right dot , allowing each qd to contain up to two electrons .",
    "an in - plane magnetic field breaks the spin degeneracy producing zeeman splitting .",
    "thus , for the right dot , we can have the following singlet and triplet states , in order of increasing energy : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where the electrons in the upper level are marked with an asterisk ( @xmath6 ) . in our previous work@xcite , we considered a basis up to the lowest energy triplet state @xmath7 , and we discussed the conditions for obtaining spin polarized current from unpolarized leads . here , we complement these results by adding the remaining excited triplet states which also participate in the pumping process .",
    "we find that at certain frequency of the ac field and in the presence of an uniform magnetic field the double quantum dot acts as a pump of fully spin polarized electrons .",
    "increasing the ac frequency , we show that an inhomogeneous magnetic field is necessary in order to obtain fully spin polarized current in the reverse direction .",
    "then the system , in such a configuration , acts as a _",
    "spin filtering just by tuning the ac frequency .",
    "the periodic variation of the gate potentials in our system , consisting on an asymmetric dqd , allows for a net dc current through the device even with no dc voltage applied @xcite : if the system is driven at frequencies ( or subharmonics ) corresponding to the energy difference between two time - independent eigenstates related by the intradot tunneling of an electron , this electron become completely delocalized @xcite . if the left reservoir ( chemical potential @xmath8 ) can donate electrons to the left dot ( at a rate @xmath9 ) and the right reservoir ( chemical potential @xmath10 )",
    "can accept electrons from the right dot ( at a rate @xmath11 ) the system will then pump electrons from left to right , even when there is no dc bias applied , namely @xmath12 .",
    "starting from this pumping principle our device has two basic characteristics : _",
    "i ) _ if the process involves two - particle states , the pumped current can be completely spin - polarized _ even if the contact leads are not spin polarized _ and _ ii ) _ the pumping can occur either through triplet ( fig .",
    "1a ) or singlet ( fig .",
    "1b ) states depending on the applied frequency , such that the _ degree of spin polarization _ can be tuned by means of the ac field .",
    "for example , if one drives the system ( initially prepared in a state with @xmath13 electrons : @xmath14 ) at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference between the singlets in both dots , namely @xmath15 ( we consider @xmath16 ) , the electron with spin @xmath17 becomes delocalized in the dqd system .",
    "if now the chemical potential for taking @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) electrons out of the right dot is above ( below ) @xmath10 , a spin - polarized current is generated .",
    "the above conditions for the chemical potentials can be achieved by breaking the spin - degeneracy through a zeeman term in each dot @xmath19 is the external magnetic field at dot @xmath20 , ( which is applied parallel to the sample in order to minimize orbital effects ) , @xmath21 is the effective g - factor and @xmath22 the bohr magneton .",
    "then , for example , a fully spin - down polarized pump is realized at the frequency @xmath23 through the sequence : @xmath24 or @xmath25 which involves singlet states .",
    "increasing the frequency of the ac voltage , the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 are brought into resonance at @xmath28 and spin up polarized current flows to the collector from the right quantum dot .",
    "however , it can be seen that the state @xmath26 is also in resonance with @xmath29 at the frequency @xmath30 , which coincides with @xmath31 for an homogeneous magnetic field , @xmath32 , and this process contributes to spin down current .",
    "consequently , the current at this frequency is partially spin polarized .",
    "this degeneracy , present in the three electron configuration , is removed if the zeeman splitting is different in the left and right dot .",
    "this could experimentally be achieved either by applying a different magnetic field to each dot or considering quantum dots with different g - factors . in that case ,",
    "@xmath33 and a pure spin up current is obtained by applying an ac potential with frequency @xmath34 .    in practical implementations of such devices ,",
    "the effects of spin relaxation and decoherence , characterized respectively by times @xmath35 and @xmath36 , need to be addressed .",
    "the most important source of decoherence in quantum dots is the hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins . recently ,",
    "several studies have been reported @xcite measuring these characteristic times and also @xmath37 , the spin dephasing time for an ensemble of nuclear spins .",
    "decoherence effects are included in our model in a phenomenological way and we give an analytical treatment to explain the numerical results .",
    "interestingly , we find that the decoherence time @xmath36 can be obtained from the width of the current vs frequency peaks .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce our model and write the equations for the time evolution of the density matrix . in section iii",
    "we describe the results obtained for homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic field . in section iv we study spin relaxation effects both numerically and analytically , and discuss the possibility of obtaining the decoherence time @xmath36 from the width and height of the current vs frequency peaks .",
    "we finalize with conclusions and outlook in section v.",
    "our system consists of an asymmetric dqd connected to two fermi - liquid leads which are in equilibrium with reservoirs kept at the chemical potentials @xmath38 , @xmath39 . using a standard tunneling hamiltonian approach , we write for the full hamiltonian @xmath40 , where @xmath41 describes the leads and @xmath42 describes the dqd .",
    "@xmath43 describe each dot including the charging energies of the dot electrons .",
    "the presence of an external magnetic field is taken into account through the term @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the zeeman splitting of the energy levels of each qd in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath46 .",
    "the model has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite but we include the description here for the sake of clarity .",
    "it is assumed that only one orbital in the left dot participates in the spin - polarized pumping process whereas _ two _ orbitals in the right dot ( energy separation @xmath47 ) are considered .",
    "the isolated left dot is thus modelled as a one  level anderson impurity : @xmath48 , whereas the isolated right dot is modelled as : @xmath49 including the exchange interaction term .",
    "the index @xmath50 denotes the two levels . in practice , we take @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with charging energies @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 are the spin operators of the two levels . as a consequence of hund s rule , the intra  dot exchange , @xmath56 , is ferromagnetic ( @xmath57 ) such that the energy of the singlet @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is higher than the energy of the triplets @xmath60 , ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "as can be seen , due to the zeeman splitting , @xmath66 .",

    "@xmath70 describes interdot tunneling .",

    "we have considered a basis of 40 states in the particle number representation which are obtained under these conditions , considering up to two electrons in each qd . to study the dynamics of a system connected to reservoirs one can consider the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) operator , @xmath76 , where one traces all the reservoir states in the complete density operator of the system , @xmath77 .",

    "+ in practice , we integrate numerically the dynamics of the rdm in the chosen basis . in particular , all the results shown in the next paragraphs are obtained by letting the system evolve from the initial state @xmath106 until a stationary state is reached .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the system is governed by rates which depend on the electrochemical potentials of the corresponding transitions .",

    "we assume the ground state in each dot to be the one with spin - up .",
