    "a ballistic atom pump is a system containing two or more reservoirs of neutral atoms or molecules and a junction connecting them containing a time - dependent potential .",
    "`` ballistic '' means that atoms move through the pump as independent particles .",
    "the theoretical description may be given by classical , semiclassical , or quantum theories .",
    "atom statistics may be bose , fermi , or boltzmann .",
    "we intend that the definition of `` ballistic atom pumps '' be interpreted broadly ( however , systems having intrinsically many - body phenomena such as viscosity should not be called `` ballistic ; '' if there are interactions among the particles , these interactions can be described by an average single - particle potential ) .",
    "particle transport is an ongoing topic of interest in a variety of systems from solid state circuitry to microfluidic devices to futuristic atomtronic components . since the advent of laser cooling , precise control and manipulation of neutral ultracold atoms has attracted attention to atomic systems that can mimic more challenging systems .",
    "one such phenomenon in electronic solid - state systems describes electronic transport through mesojunctions @xcite having time - dependent potential barriers , a phenomenon often called `` quantum pumping''@xcite .",
    "the choice of potential likewise emulates the turnstile quantum pump usually studied in mesoscopic electronics @xcite .",
    "although quantum pumping has been theorized for decades @xcite , there has only recently been an experimental realization of such a system due to the challenges of overcoming capacitive coupling and rectification effects in electronic systems @xcite .",
    "recent proposals have suggested bypassing these difficulties by simulating a quantum pump in a system of neutral cold atoms @xcite .",
    "neutral atom transport is also becoming increasingly important in its own right due to the ongoing development of atomtronics , which seeks to replicate critical tools of electronics in neutral atoms .",
    "analogues of batteries , diodes , transistors , and recently hysteresis @xcite have been explored in ultracold neutral atom systems .",
    "the motivation behind such devices is multifarious .",
    "unlike their electronic counterparts , these systems allow scientists to study analogous tools in well - controlled and idealized environments like optical lattices . additionally , long coherence times provide unique opportunities for quantum state preparation , storage , and readout , making atomtronic devices a serious competitor as a basis for quantum computers @xcite . finally , neutral atoms present degrees of freedom not available in their electronic counterparts , such as bosons , fermions , and scalable interactions . in this paper , we present a detailed study of the classical and quantum features of a ballistic atom pump which has potential applications such as a battery , diode , or rectifier in atomtronic circuits .",
    "the pumps we consider in this paper have two reservoirs and a pump which is effectively one - dimensional , so the hamiltonian is @xmath0 we choose @xmath1 to consist of two repulsive barriers oscillating with the same frequency @xmath2 , but not necessarily with the same amplitude or phase .",
    "we study rectangular barriers ( easiest theoretically ) and gaussian barriers ( easiest experimentally using optical forces ) .",
    "the questions we address are : can such systems pump atoms preferentially from one side to the other without an external bias , such as a difference in chemical potentials in the reservoirs ?",
    "in particular , can we make an atom `` diode '' that will allow atoms to pass through the pump in only one direction ? in order to understand the quantum features of such a pump , it is necessary to develop a clear understanding of classical scattering by a pair of oscillating potential barriers that function as a turnstile pump .",
    "we begin with a precise specification of the models we study .",
    "then we consider simple asymmetric pumps that rectify net particle transport , which we call `` particle diodes '' because they allow transport in only one direction for certain ranges of initial particle energy .",
    "these diodes have one barrier fixed and one oscillating barrier",
    ". then we consider pumps that are symmetric in the sense that the two barriers are identical , but their oscillations are not in phase with each other .",
    "we prove a symmetry theorem which shows that such pumps can give no net particle pumping if the behavior of the particles is classical and the initial phase - space distribution is uniform in both reservoirs .",
    "however , if the phase - space distribution is not uniform , then such pumps can produce net particle transport in either direction .",
    "we also show that if the two potential barriers are separated by a modest distance , atoms can get stuck in a `` complex '' or  resonance zone  between them , and the system is a nice model of chaotic transport @xcite .",
    "( in a separate paper @xcite we have provided a topological description of this chaotic transport ) .",
    "the relationships among classical , semiclassical , and quantum descriptions for transport past a single oscillating gaussian barrier were discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "consider the case that atoms enter the pump from one side with fixed momentum @xmath3 and kinetic energy @xmath4 . in the quantum description , because the barriers are oscillating with a fixed frequency , floquet theory tells us that after passing through the pump , the spectrum of transmitted energies is a set of narrow peaks at energies @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an integer .",
    "the heights of these peaks can be computed numerically by solving the schroedinger equation , but in general no patterns are visible in those heights .    in the classical description ( again assuming that particles enter with a fixed initial momentum @xmath3 but a range of positions @xmath7 ) , then the final momentum @xmath8 is a bounded periodic function of the initial position @xmath7 , @xmath9 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of the range of this function define the classically allowed region . inside this classically allowed region , provided that @xmath10 is continuous , there must be an even number of trajectories leading to each final momentum .",
    "the distribution of final momenta is a smooth function except at extrema of @xmath10 , where the distribution has an integrable singularity .",
    "one finds that the floquet peaks obtained in the quantum description are large primarily in the classically allowed region , with small spillover past the boundaries ( momentum - space tunneling ) .",
    "still the heights of peaks are incomprehensible .",
    "finally , in semiclassical theory , for each final momentum one sums over the initial positions that give trajectories leading to that final momentum , and incorporates phases for each such orbit ( momentum - space action plus maslov indices ) .",
    "summing over one cycle of @xmath11 produces a smooth function , and the relative heights of the floquet peaks are discrete values of it . summing over many cycles of @xmath11",
    "causes the peaks seen in the quantum description to emerge , with good agreement between the two methods ( see figs .  [ gaussrects ] and  [ gauss2osc ] ) .",
    "we show a few representative calculations of each type in this paper , but we concentrate on the classical description , with the understanding that semiclassical calculations can be carried out when desired , and that the semiclassical description agrees well with the quantum description .",
    "our atom pump consists of two repulsive potential barriers with amplitude oscillations that have the same frequency , but are not in phase with one another : @xmath12 in this paper we examine both rectangular and gaussian potentials .",
    "the rectangular barrier potentials are given by :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the average height of each barrier , @xmath19 is the amplitude of oscillation of each , @xmath20 is the common frequency and @xmath21 is the period , @xmath22 is an additional phase term , and @xmath23 is width of each barrier .",
    "the left and right barriers are centered at @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and always have a center - to - center distance of @xmath26 .",
    "when the barriers touch , i.e. , have no separation , @xmath27 .",
    "if only the left - hand barrier is oscillating then @xmath28 .",

    ", we typically choose @xmath40 . in quantum and semiclassical mechanics",
    "one additional parameter arises , the value of @xmath41 , which we set as @xmath42 . the general way to apply such scaling principles is given in @xcite .",
    "the units used in this paper are theoretical , and are the same as those used in @xcite .",
    "namely , the choice of a theoretical unit convention based on @xmath42 and @xmath33 is equivalent to selecting an arbitrary time unit @xmath43 and a related length unit @xmath44 , with @xmath45 j@xmath46s .",
    "the corresponding energy unit is @xmath47 , while the mass unit is that of the particle , @xmath48 .",
    "we start with a distribution of particles far to the left of the barriers , far to the right , or both . for our classical calculations ,",
    "the distribution has a single momentum ( i.e. it is a delta - function in momentum space centered at @xmath3 ) .",
    "the distribution in position space is uniform over a length @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial velocity of the particles ( i.e. uniform over a length corresponding to the distance the incident particles travel in one cycle of the barriers ) . in semiclassical and quantum calculations ,",
    "we begin with a wave packet that is narrow in momentum space , centered at @xmath3 , and correspondingly wide in position space , @xmath51 .",
    "thus its magnitude is nearly uniform over the length @xmath52 corresponding to a cycle .",
    "the wave function in position space at the initial time is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is @xmath55the initial probability density is thus @xmath56 , which is a gaussian centered at @xmath57 with standard deviation @xmath58 .",
    "our quantum calculations are performed in the same fashion as in @xcite , and are based on propagating the wave packet with the time - dependent schrdinger equation via a split - step operator method @xcite .",
    "we determine the net particle transport in these systems by the following process : 1 ) for each initial momentum , launch particles toward the barriers from the left , and compute and record the fraction transmitted and reflected .",
    "also record the final momenta of transmitted and reflected particles .",
    "2 ) launch particles with the same initial energy toward the barriers from the right , and compute the fraction transmitted and reflected , and their final momenta .",
    "3 ) sum the results of each of these to obtain the net fraction of particles transmitted left to right ( which may be negative if more are transmitted from right to left ) .",
    "4 ) if appropriate , average over initial momenta .",
    "we define the fractional transport of particles through the pump as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of particles per cycle scattered to the right for each @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the number of particles per cycle scattered to the left .",
    "the sum @xmath63 represents all particles for a given @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath64 is positive when more particles are scattered to the right for a given @xmath61 , and negative when more particles are scattered to the left .",
    "when equal numbers of particles scatter to the right and left , e.g. when all particles are reflected or transmitted , @xmath65 .",
    "a double - barrier particle pump can make a kind of diode , in which net particle pumping can only be in one direction if the initial particle energy is sufficiently small .",
    "this type of diode consists of one static barrier which is high enough to prevent transmission of particles incident from one direction , and one oscillating barrier which can lift particles approaching from the other direction over the static barrier .",
    "this is analogous to photon - assisted tunneling @xcite .",
    "when the incident energy of particles is greater than the height of the static barrier , net particle transport is only possible in the opposite direction .",
    "it is simplest if the two barriers are touching each other .",
    "let us simplify the description of the potentials to @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a periodic function of @xmath68 with period @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is a constant .",
    "suppose @xmath71",
    "then particles incident from the right with kinetic energy @xmath72 can not pass over the right barrier .",
    "from the left , ( see fig .  [ rectexample](a ) ) a stream of particles having fixed kinetic energy @xmath72 and density independent of position all file into the elevator when it is on the ground floor ( fig .",
    "[ rectexample](b ) ) , and then at @xmath73 they are lifted abruptly to the penthouse level on the roof , where the back door of the elevator opens ( fig .",

    "[ rectexample](e ) ) .",
    "meanwhile the door of the elevator has slammed again and it abruptly returns to ground level .    , and particles on top of it gain enough energy to transmit past the right barrier , as seen in ( d ) and ( e ) . ]    for this system , if the barrier width is @xmath76 and if the first particle arrives at the left edge of the left barrier at @xmath77 , half of the particles incident on the elevator from the left  the ones that arrive for @xmath78(mod@xmath79  go over the barrier , and the other half  arriving for @xmath80(mod@xmath81  are reflected by the left - hand barrier , so the transmitted fraction is half of the incident fraction .",
    "is this the theoretical maximum for transport ?",
    "we can not think of any other function @xmath67 that would improve the performance .",
    "however , we can get a larger fraction transmitted if on the elevator for @xmath82(mod@xmath81 a pusher shoves the passengers to the right so they exit the elevator more quickly .    clearly , when the energy of incident particles is less than the amplitude of the static barrier , the only possible direction of fractional particle transport is left - to - right .",
    "this is because all particles approaching from the right are reflected , while some particles incident from the left may hop onto the oscillating barrier and gain enough energy from it to transmit over the static barrier . on the other hand ,",

    "the double barrier turnstile pump might be viewed ( with some caution ) as a momentum - space interferometer . in this picture",

    "( such as fig .  [ gauss2osc ] ) , the first barrier produces multiple planewave states , and then the second barrier mixes these and produces additional planewave states . in this way",
    "a turnstile pump may be viewed as a discrete multipath momentum space interferometer . however",
    ", this description can not be accurate if the barriers are not well - separated .",
    "the barriers must be sufficiently far apart that the configuration - space wave function in the region between them is approximately a superposition of plane waves , but not so far apart that packets associated with different floquet states have separated .",
    "in summary , we have defined and described ballistic atom pumps , showing that for finite ranges of initial particle energies , such systems can create net particle transport in either direction .",
    "the direction of particle pumping is highly sensitive to barrier parameters and to the initial energy of the particles .",
    "it is not possible to predict the direction or magnitude of particle pumping without detailed calculations",
    ".    if tunneling can be neglected , diode pumps  which only allow net transport in one direction for particles below a certain initial energy  can be constructed . at sufficiently high incident",
    "particle energies , these diodes only allow net particle transport in the opposite direction .",
    "we have studied these pumps classically , semiclassically , and quantum mechanically .",
    "while classical theory gives a slowly - varying final momentum probability for scattered particles , quantum theory yields final momentum probabilities sharply - peaked at momenta satisfying @xmath346 .",
    "the range of @xmath6 for which there are appreciable peaks is governed by the underlying classically - allowed momentum range of scattered particles .",
