    "the microscopic description of the single - particle properties in nuclear matter must deal with the treatment of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the strong short - range and tensor components which are required in realistic nn interactions to fit the nn scattering data , lead to corresponding correlations in the nuclear wave function .",
    "these nn correlations are important to describe bulk properties of dense matter .",
    "they also modify the spectral distribution of the single - particle strength in a significant way .",
    "recent calculations have demonstrated without ambiguity that nn correlations produce a partial occupation of the single - particle states , which are completely occupied in the mean field approach , and a wide distribution of the single - particle strength in energy .",
    "these two features have found experimental grounds in the analysis of @xmath0 reactions @xcite .",
    "historically , various tools have been employed to account for correlations in the nuclear many - body wave function .",
    "these include the traditional brueckner hole - line expansion @xcite and variational approaches using correlated basis functions @xcite .",
    "attempts have also been made to employ the technique of a self - consistent evaluation of green s functions ( scgf ) @xcite to the solution of the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "this method offers various advantages : ( i ) the single - particle green s function contains detailed information about the spectral function , i.e. , the distribution of single - particle strength as a function of missing energy and momentum ; ( ii ) the method can be extended to finite temperatures , a feature which is of interest for the study of the nuclear properties in astrophysical environments ; ( iii ) the brueckner hartree - fock ( bhf ) approximation , the approximation to the hole - line expansion which is commonly used , can be considered as a specific prescription within this scheme .",
    "enormous progress in the scgf applications to nuclear matter has been achieved in the last years , both at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the efforts at @xmath1 are mainly oriented to provide the appropriate theoretical support for the interpretation of the @xmath0 experiments , while research at finite @xmath2 is essentially focused on the description of the nuclear medium in astrophysical environments or on the interpretation of heavy ion collisions dynamics . in all cases , a key quantity is the single - particle spectral function which measures the possibility to add or remove a particle with a given momentum at a specific energy .",
    "a useful way to study the properties of these single - particle spectral functions is by means of the energy weighted sum rules , which are well established in the literature and which have been numerically analyzed for symmetric nuclear matter at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .",
    "recently , the single - particle spectral functions in hot asymmetric nuclear matter have been calculated within the scgf framework @xcite . in this computation ,",
    "the bulk properties of asymmetric dense matter were computed , namely the energy per particle , the symmetry energy and the chemical potentials .",
    "in addition , and since the scgf approach gives access to the correlated momentum distributions of neutrons and protons , the influence of the asymmetry on the depletion of the momentum states could be studied . in neutron - rich matter",
    "the proton states with momenta below the fermi momentum are more strongly depleted than in the symmetric system at the same density . in this case the occupation of neutron states within their fermi sphere are enhanced compared to the symmetric case .",
    "this indicates that the proton - neutron interaction is a stronger source of correlation as compared to proton - proton and neutron - neutron interaction .    in this paper",
    ", we want to use the energy weighted sum rules to investigate the dependence of the single - particle spectral functions on the asymmetry more in detail .",
    "these sum rules may help to explore the isospin dependence of the short - range correlations in asymmetric matter . besides , the analysis of the energy weighted sum rules provides valuable tests on the numerical accuracy of our calculations .",
    "all the computations discussed in this paper are performed in the framework of scgf employing a fully self - consistent ladder approximation in which the complete spectral function has been used to describe the intermediate states in the galistkii - feynman equation @xcite .",
    "after this introduction , we outline the derivation of the energy weighted sum rules in section 2 .",
    "the results obtained for hot asymmetric nuclear using the charge dependent bonn potential cdbonn @xcite are presented in section 3 , where a short summary of the main conclusions is given as well .",

    "the integration of the function @xmath30 leads to the occupation probability @xmath36 for the state with isospin @xmath37 and momentum @xmath38 at the inverse temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be compared with the hole and particle part of the spectral function at zero temperature . in particular , the limit of @xmath30 at zero temperature reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ground state with @xmath11 neutrons and @xmath12 protons ( such that @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 labels the excited energy state of a system with a neutron or a proton less ( depending on which type of annihilation operator @xmath43 has been applied to the ground state ) . by its own definition , it is clear that the lowest possible energy of the final state is the ground state energy of the @xmath44 particle system , so that there is an upper limit for the hole spectral function @xmath45 , both for neutrons and protons . in a similar way one can define the particle part of the spectral function and find a lower bound for the excitation energy of the @xmath46 particle system , measured with respect to the ground state of the @xmath47 particle system . at zero temperature",

    "the first one corresponds to symmetric nuclear matter @xmath67 and serves as a guide - line for the other cases .",
    "the last one has a very low proton fraction @xmath68 and corresponds to the @xmath69stable composition of matter with nucleons , electrons and muons at @xmath66 mev and @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "this composition can be computed thanks to the fact that we know the asymmetry dependence of both the neutron and the proton chemical potentials at this density @xcite . finally , we consider an intermediate fraction @xmath70 which is useful to identify the effects for low asymmetries of the system .",
    "we start by discussing the momentum dependence of the single - particle spectral functions of neutrons and protons .",
    "depending on how far above or below the considered momentum is from the fermi momentum of the corresponding particle , we expect a very different behavior for the spectral function .",
    "[ fig:01 ] shows the neutron ( left panels ) and proton ( right panels ) single - particle spectral functions for three different momenta ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with @xmath73 the fermi momentum of each nucleon species ) at a proton fraction of @xmath68 .",

    "similarly , @xmath79 extends to the region below @xmath77 . in general",
    "there is no longer a clear separation in energy between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , as it is the case for @xmath1 .",
    "actually , the maxima of @xmath80 and @xmath81 can even coincide .    for the case of neutrons at @xmath82 ,",
    "the peak of the spectral function is provided by @xmath83 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the position of this peak , which can be identified with the quasi - particle energy @xmath84 , is well below the chemical potential @xmath9 , which implies that the value of fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath35 at this energy @xmath85 is very close to one ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : specdis ] ) .",
    "since the quasi - particle peak is well below @xmath9 , the thermal effects do not fill up the minimum in the spectral function at @xmath86 and we still observe some kind of separation in energy between @xmath83 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , around @xmath88 there is an energy interval , in which both @xmath83 and @xmath87 are small but different from zero , i.e. an interval in which these functions overlap .",
    "a similar situation is observed for the neutron spectral function at @xmath89 . in this case",
    "the quasi - particle energy is well above @xmath9 , which means that @xmath90 is very close to one at this energy and the peak structure is supplied by @xmath87 ( see eq .",

    "the thermal effects fill up the zero that the spectral function has at @xmath93 in the @xmath1 limit and the overlap region of @xmath83 and @xmath87 is enhanced .    in the case of very small proton fraction , like @xmath94 = 0.04",
    ", the fermi momentum @xmath95 is rather small and consequently the quasi - particle energies are close to the fermi energy @xmath10 for @xmath96 as well as @xmath82 and @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , although the relative distances to the fermi surfaces are the same , there are strong overlaps between @xmath98 and @xmath99 at all the three momenta . even in the case of @xmath100 , a small peak structure for @xmath98 around @xmath93 can be observed .    in table",
    "[ tab:01 ] ( neutrons ) and table [ tab:02 ] ( protons ) we report the fraction of the integrated strength of @xmath30 below and above the corresponding chemical potential , @xmath77 .",

    ", the integrated strength above the chemical potential can be considered as a genuine thermal effect .",
    "as expected , these thermal effects are important around @xmath73 , where the overlap between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is significant .",
    "notice also that for this very neutron - rich system , neutrons are less affected by temperature , while protons ( which have a substantially lower fermi momentum and can thus be considered as a dilute system ) are much more influenced by temperature .",
    "for instance , protons show a large amount of strength above @xmath103 up to momenta @xmath104 . for the sake of completeness",
    ", the corresponding occupation numbers for each species are also listed in those tables .",
    "the @xmath55 sum rule is fulfilled with an accuracy better than @xmath105 % for both neutrons and protons in the complete momentum range .",

    "[ fig:02 ] at the three proton fractions @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "( [ eq_m1 ] ) ( solid lines ) lie on top of each other and can not be distinguished . to understand the @xmath38-dependence of the different contributions to @xmath57 , it is useful to keep in mind the proton and neutron chemical potentials at the different concentrations given in table [ tab:03 ] .",
    "the lower dash - dotted line shows the @xmath57 contribution from @xmath30 .",
    "for momenta below @xmath109 , the contribution of @xmath30 to @xmath57 is dominated by the quasi - particle peak , which lies below @xmath77 . as the momentum increases , the peak appears closer to @xmath110 and its weight in the integral",
    "is diminished , which makes the integral smaller in magnitude and thus the contribution to the sum rule becomes an increasing function of @xmath38 .",
    "when we get closer to the fermi momentum @xmath109 , the peak moves to @xmath111 and the position of the chemical potential becomes crucial .",
    "as far as the chemical potential is negative , the contribution of @xmath30 will be negative because the fermi - dirac function falls off close to @xmath77 and the integral will only catch a little positive zone if the chemical potential is close to @xmath112 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the chemical potential is positive , the integrand is not zero for @xmath113 and there can be a non - negligible positive contribution to the integral when the quasi - particle peak lies between @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "this cancellations between positive and negative contributions give rise to the structures observed for the @xmath30 sum rule close to the fermi momentum . in the upper - right panel of fig .  [ fig:02 ] , for instance",
    ", the asymmetry is so extreme that the neutron chemical potential @xmath116 and the positive contribution to the integral is important enough to pull the sum rule to positive values for @xmath117 .",
    "finally , for high momenta , @xmath30 is strongly suppressed ( the quasi - particle peak lies in the region @xmath102 , which is suppressed by the fermi - dirac factor ) and the contribution to the sum rule goes to zero .",
    "the upper dash - dotted line displays the contribution from @xmath31 . due to the short - range correlations",
    ", there is always a high energy tail that gives rise to a positive contribution which , for momenta well below @xmath118 , is nearly constant . in the case of the neutron sum rules ,",
    "this constant decreases slightly with decreasing proton fraction , although the chemical potential @xmath9 increases significantly .",
    "such a small decrease is in accordance with the fact that the neutron - proton correlations are dominant compared to the neutron - neutron ones .",
    "these high energy tails ( which are mainly caused by short - range correlations ) are , nevertheless , not much affected by asymmetry .",
    "when the momenta becomes larger than @xmath119 , @xmath57 increases monotonously following the location of the quasi - particle peak , which moves to higher energies when the momentum grows .    also for protons",
    "one observes a contribution from @xmath31 to the sum rule which is almost a constant for momenta smaller than the fermi momentum . in this case , however , this constant is almost independent of the proton fraction , although the chemical potential @xmath10 gets significantly more attractive with decreasing @xmath94 . at small values of @xmath94 ,",
    "the neutron abundance is large and this leads to strong correlation effects in the proton spectral function . in particular at @xmath68 , which is the case corresponding to the lowest fermi momenta , the total contribution of @xmath120 is the result of a balance between positive and negative contributions .",
    "these can result in a minimum for @xmath121 . in that particular proton fraction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] ) , the quasi - particle peaks lies always below @xmath110 and thus it gives rise to a negative contribution .",
    "the relative width of this peak and the detailed structure of the high - energy tail can push the integral to negative values ( almost @xmath122 mev at @xmath123 mev ) . at larger momenta",
    ", however , the contribution to @xmath57 of @xmath99 starts to grow steadily .",
    "notice that for this asymmetry we can not say that this is due to the movement of the quasi - particle peak , because even at @xmath124 the quasi - particle peak lies in the region where the contribution to the integral is negative .",
    "the growth in @xmath38 is , to a large extent , a consequence of the contributions to the spectral functions at large energies .",
    "in addition to these contributions , we have plotted in the dotted lines of fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] the hartree - fock approximation of @xmath57 at the same temperature , density and proton fraction .",
    "this approximation turns out to give a very good estimate of @xmath57 , an interesting result which has been already observed in the previous analysis for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this result allows for a quantitative estimate of the amount of correlations produced by a given nn potential without performing sophisticated many - body calculations .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noticing that the value of @xmath57 ( specially for large @xmath38 ) is not so much affected by the asymmetry of the system .",
    "it is very similar for both neutrons and protons in all the three cases considered .",
    "this is a somehow surprising result , since we have seen that the separate contributions of @xmath81 and @xmath80 can indeed be very different .",
    "of course , at high momentum the kinetic energy is dominant and this could explain this fact in part",
    ".    however , even at zero momentum the effect of the asymmetry is rather moderate , as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] , where @xmath125 , @xmath126 ( the hartree - fock approximation to the self - energy ) and the quasi - particle energy @xmath127 at zero momentum are plotted as a function of the proton fraction .",
    "let us consider the highly asymmetric case of @xmath68 .",
    "the isospin splitting of the hartree - fock energies ( @xmath82 ) at this asymmetry is around 10 mev , which is rather small compared to the isospin splitting of the quasi - particle energies , which is around 55 mev .",
    "this means that the stronger binding of the proton states as compared to the neutron states is to a small extent due to the attractive neutron - proton interaction in the bare nn potential , the born term of the @xmath2-matrix .",
    "the obtained attraction is then mainly due to the terms in the @xmath2-matrix coming from the second and higher orders in the nn potential .",
    "in other words , it is an effect of strong correlations in the isospin equal to zero nn channels ( like the @xmath128 partial wave ) , which lead to the deeply bound quasi - particle energy for protons at this large neutron abundance .",
    "these correlation effects , however , are also important for a redistribution of single - particle strength for protons with @xmath82 to energies well above the fermi energy , leading to a low occupation probability ( see table [ tab:02 ] ) and a large positive contribution to the sum rule @xmath57 . this positive contribution yields to a value of @xmath129 , which is even above the hf energy .",
    "the effects of correlations for the corresponding energies of the neutron state are much weaker , indicating that correlation effects in the isospin one nn channels are weaker .",
    "so we observe a compensation of correlation effects in the energy weighted sum rule . on the one hand ,",
    "correlations lead to a more attractive quasi - particle energy ( compared to the hf result ) and therefore to a more attractive contribution of the quasi - particle pole to the sum rule .",
    "on the other hand , correlations shift single - particle strength to high energies , which yield a repulsive contribution to @xmath57 .",
    "this compensation of correlation effects explains that the value of the energy integrated sum rule for the correlated system can be very similar to the hf result .",
    "this compensation of correlation effects can also be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] , which shows the exhaustion of the sum rules @xmath55 ( left panel ) and @xmath57 ( right panel ) at a momentum @xmath130 mev for both neutrons ( solid lines ) and protons ( dashed lines ) , at the three different proton fractions .",
    "the first thing to be observed is that the asymmetry affects mainly the amount of strength exhausted at intermediate energy regions , while there is not a noticeable difference at high energies . for @xmath131 ,",
    "i.e. the symmetric case , the quasi - particle energies for neutrons and protons at @xmath130 mev , are the same : @xmath132 mev .",
    "when the proton fraction decreases , the quasi - particle energies split .",
    "neutrons become more repulsive ( @xmath133 mev ) , in contrast with protons ( @xmath134 mev ) .",
    "this behavior is confirmed at @xmath135 , resulting in @xmath136 mev and @xmath137 mev . in the case of @xmath55 , since the quasi - particle peak of protons is located at lower energies , the amount of strength exhausted at lower energies is larger for protons than for neutrons .",
    "this trend changes at intermediate energies and both strengths merge together for large energies , which is an indication of the fact that , for these momenta and asymmetries , the quasi - particle contributions to the sum rule of neutrons are larger than those of protons , thus explaining why the increase in @xmath55 at the quasi - particle pole is larger in the former case .",
    "the same type of analysis is valid for @xmath57 .",
    "notice that , as previously mentioned , the final value of @xmath57 is not much affected by the asymmetry and the behavior at high energies is the same for all the cases .    to summarize",
    ", we have analyzed the behavior of the energy weighted sum rules of single - particle spectral functions of hot asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the sum rules are very well fulfilled , because the @xmath2-matrix approximation itself respects the analytical properties of both the self - energy and the green s function , in which the sum rules are based .",
    "nevertheless , they are a good test of the numerical consistency of the calculation , which may be helpful e.g. in deciding the best distribution of the energy mesh points when one has to work with spectral functions .    employing realistic nn interactions , an important source of correlations come from the strong components in the neutron - proton interaction . as a consequence , one observes in neutron - rich matter a larger depletion of the occupation probabilities for protons with momenta below the fermi - momentum than for neutrons .",
    "one also finds that these correlations , at this asymmetry , lead to much more attractive quasi - particle energies for protons than those obtained in the hf approximation .",
    "the same effect is observed in neutrons , although it is considerably weaker .",
    "this shift of the quasi - particle energies tends to lead to more attractive energy weighted sum rules @xmath57 .",
    "this effect is compensated by the fact that the very same correlations are also responsible for a shift of single - particle strength to high positive energies . as a consequence , the energy integrated sum rules and the isospin splitting in asymmetric nuclear matter for the correlated system yield results which are very close to the hf ones . in both cases , however , there is not a strong dependence on asymmetry due to the lack of tensor correlations .",
    "this relocation of single - particle strength , on the other hand , can be nicely observed in the convergence of the energy weighted sum rule , which is therefore an indicator of correlation effects .",
