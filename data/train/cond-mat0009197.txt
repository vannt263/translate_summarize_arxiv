    "the antiferromagnetic s - f exchange coupling of conduction electrons to localized spins in heavy fermion rare - earth systems is responsible for two competing effects : the screening of the localized moments due to the kondo effect and the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction among magnetic impurities which may induce a long - range magnetic ( antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ) ordering or eventually a spin glass magnetic ordering .",
    "the doniach diagram@xcite gives a good description of this competition : the neel temperature @xmath3is firstly increasing with increasing the absolute value of the exchange interaction constant @xmath4 , then it is passing through a maximum and finally it tends to zero at the `` quantum critical point '' ( qcp ) .",
    "such a decrease of @xmath3 down to the qcp has been observed in many cerium compounds , such as@xmath5 or @xmath6 , under pressure . above the qcp",
    ", there exists a very strong heavy fermion character , but several possible behaviours , i.e. the classical fermi liquid one with eventually a reduced kondo temperature@xcite or different non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) ones , have been observed in cerium or ytterbium compounds@xcite .",
    "but , in the case of disordered cerium alloys , the disorder can yield a spin glass ( sg ) phase in addition to the nfl behaviour at low temperatures around the qcp .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram of @xmath7 has been extensively studied@xcite .",
    "cecu is antiferromagnetic below 3.5 k and ceni is a non magnetic compound with an intermediate valence.the low temperature antiferromagnetic phase changes , around @xmath8 , to a ferromagnetic one which finally disappears around @xmath9 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "a spin glass state is deduced from all measured bulk properties , such as for example the ac susceptibility ; for example , for @xmath10 , the sg state exists between 2 k and the curie temperature @xmath11 . at @xmath9",
    ", there exists below 6 k only a sg state which transforms to the intermediate valence ceni , after passing probably through a kondo lattice system .",
    "thus , in the @xmath12 system , there appears a sg phase at finite temperatures above the ferromagnetic order and finally a sg - kondo transition occurs for small @xmath13 values .",
    "another disordered cerium system , namely @xmath14 alloys , has been also studied for different @xmath13 values , by different experimental techniques including muon spin relaxation@xcite .",
    "the compound @xmath15 is antiferromagnetic below 21 k and @xmath16 is an intermediate valence compound ; the qcp of these alloys lies around @xmath17 .",
    "the muon spin relaxation experiments in the quantum critical region ( @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) show that a fraction of ce ions experience random f - f indirect exchange interactions , which causes frustration of some ce spins in the system .",
    "so , for @xmath18 and @xmath20 , frustrated moments of cerium freeze like in a spin glass while the other ce moments form a disordered antiferromagnetic state .",
    "thus , near the qcp , a spin glass state can exist in these alloys , in addition to the observed nfl behaviour .",
    "so , a striking novel behaviour , i.e. the appearance of a spin glass state at finite temperatures in some disordered cerium alloys , has been observed and a sg - kondo transition is developing with increasing @xmath13 around the qcp .",
    "the aim of our paper is to present a theoretical model that describes the spin glass - kondo phase transitions , and that we do by studying a system hamiltonian that couples the localized spins of a kondo lattice with an additional long range random interaction , like in the sherrington- kirkpatrick spin glass model @xcite .",
    "a similar hamiltonian has been considered in @xcite to describe nfl behaviour and a qcp in some heavy fermions compounds , although the relevant approximations differ in this work and ours .",
    "the authors in @xcite are primarily interested in the description of the qcp at @xmath21 , then they solve first for the kondo effect by decoupling the conduction electrons bath into independent conduction electron `` reservoirs '' , with no communication between the reservoirs at different sites .    during the course of our work",
    ", another paper using the same hamiltonian has been proposed@xcite .",
    "the representation of popov and fedotov eliminates the unwanted spin states but the approximations involved are in fact different from those used in our work .",
    "they study essentially the spin glass state and they finally obtain a second order sg transition with a transition temperature depressed by the kondo effect , in second order perturbation theory .    in the present paper we take a different approach : the localized spins of the kondo lattice will be effectively immersed in a common bath of conduction electrons and the kondo effect will be studied in a quantum static approximation that is basically equivalent to the mean field decoupling scheme @xcite .",
    "the spin operators are represented by bilinear combinations of fermionic creation and destruction operators , for the localized f - electrons , and the spin glass transition will be studied within the static approximation .",
    "this deserves some special discussion . in the ising quantum spin glass ( qsg ) model @xcite , the spin operator @xmath22 commutes with",
    "the particle number operator @xmath23 and the static ansatz gives the exact answer , as the problem is essentially classic .",
    "when we add to the fermionic ising qsg a s - d exchange coupling of the localized spins to the conduction band electrons the problem ceases to be exactly soluble and the static ansatz is just an approximation , that we consider justified to describe a transition at finite temperature . it has been shown in @xcite that the exact numerical solution of bray and moore s equations @xcite gives for the spin - spin correlation function @xmath24 roughly its constant classical value at finite temperature , what justifies the use of the static ansatz of @xcite at not very low temperatures in the heisenberg spin glass .",
    "we consider then the static ansatz which corresponds to an approximation similar to mean field theory , where by neglecting time fluctuations we can provide a description of the phase transitions occurring at finite temperature .",
    "we use functional integral techniques where the spin operators are represented by bilinear combinations of fermionic ( anticommuting ) grassmann fields .",
    "as we show in the next section , this method is ideally suited to describe a kondo lattice transition , and it has been recently applied by two of us to the study of fermionic ising spin glasses with local bcs pairing @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite also showed the existence of several characteristic temperatures in the ising fermionic model , with the de almeida - thouless instability @xcite occurring at a temperature lower than the spin glass transition temperature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect.2 we describe the model and relevant results , we reserve sect.3 for discussions and conclusion , while the detailed mathematical calculations are left for the appendix .",
    "we consider a kondo lattice system with localized spins @xmath25 at sites @xmath26 , coupled to the electrons of the conduction band via a s - d exchange interaction .",
    "it is necessary to introduce explicitly the resultant rkky interaction by means of a random , long range coupling among localized spins like in the sherrington kirkpatrick ( sk ) model for a spin glass . to describe the kondo effect in a mean - field - like theory it is sufficient to keep only the spin - flip terms @xcite in the exchange hamiltonian , while the spin glass interaction is represented by the quantum ising hamiltonian where only interact the z - components of the localized spins @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is :    @xmath27    @xmath28 \\label{2.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath29    where @xmath30 ,    @xmath31\\nonumber \\label{2.4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath32 are creation and destruction operators for electrons with spin projection @xmath33 or @xmath34 in the localized ( conduction ) band , that satisfy the standard fermion anticommutation rules .",
    "we also have @xmath35 where : @xmath36 the energies @xmath37 are referred to the chemical potentials @xmath38 , respectively .    the coupling @xmath39 in eq.([2.3 ] ) is an independent random variable with the gaussian distribution    @xmath40    functional integration techniques have proved to be a suitable approach to describe phase transitions in disordered quantum mechanical many - particle systems @xcite . the static approximation within this formulation",
    "consists in neglecting time fluctuations of the order parameter , and when it is combined with the neglect of space fluctuations it leads to the usual hartree - fock , mean field like approximation . when dealing with the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 2.1])-eq.([2.3 ] ) , we notice that in the limiting case @xmath41 we obtain a pure quantum ising spin glass where the static approximation gives the exact result @xcite , while for @xmath42 we recover the mean field approximation that has been used succesfully to describe the kondo lattice @xcite . then we consider that the use of the static approximation has an interpolation character and will provide reliable results to describe critical behaviour at finite temperature @xcite in systems that do not present a quantum critical point .    in the lagrangian formulation @xcite the partition function is expressed as    @xmath43    where the action @xmath44 is given by    @xmath45    in both expressions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are anticommuting , complex grassmann variables associated to the conduction and localized electrons fields , respectively , while @xmath48 is an imaginary time and @xmath49 the inverse absolute temperature .",

    "we can also remark that we get here only `` pure '' kondo or sg phases and never a mixed sg - kondo phase with the two order parameters different from zero ; this result is probably connected to the approximations used here to treat the starting hamiltonian .",
