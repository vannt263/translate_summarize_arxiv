    "spatial homogeneity and isotropy are large - scale properties incorporated into the standard description of the universe via the cosmological principle ( cp ) ( see , e.g. , goodman , 1995 ; maartens , 2011 ; clarkson , 2012 for a discussion ) . according to current cosmological data ( eisenstein _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; blake _ et al .",
    "_ 2011 ; suzuki _ et al . _ , 2012 ; bennett _ et al . _ , 2013 ; ade _ et al . _ , 2013 ; betoule _ et al . _ , 2014 ) , the best picture nowadays is provided by the so - called @xmath8cdm model , a homogeneous and isotropic scenario which accounts well for the current accelerating phase of the universe , most of the physical features in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum and the observed large - scale structure .    from the theoretical viewpoint",
    ", however , it is well known that there is still no satisfactory description of the mechanism behind cosmic acceleration which is a crucial aspect to the cosmological modelling .",
    "this in turn motivates the need to probe fundamental hypotheses in cosmology which includes the validity of the cp .",
    "moreover , recent analyses have reported cosmological anomalies that may indicate deviations from an isotropic universe , such as large scale bulk - flow ( colin _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 , turnbull _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 , feindt _ et al .",
    "_ , 2013 ) , alignment of low multipoles in the cmb power spectrum , cmb hemispherical asymmetry ( eriksen _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ; bernui _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) , large scale alignment in the optical polarization qso data ( hutsemkers _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; hutsemkers _ et al . _ , 2014 ) and spatial dependence of the value of the fine structure constant ( mariano & perivolaropoulos , 2012 ) .",
    "if an isotropic expansion is observationally confirmed , it would reinforce the search for a cosmological description in the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker class .",
    "otherwise , models with a more general spatial geometry should be seriously explored to describe the structure and evolution of the universe .",
    "the idea of testing the cp with the hubble diagram is recent .",
    "previous efforts were done with several catalogs ( kolatt & lahav , 2001 ; schwarz & weinhorst , 2007 ; antoniou & perivolaropoulos , 2010 ; gumpta & saini , 2010 ; cai & tuo , 2012 ; kalus _ et al .",

    "_ , 2014a , gupta & singh , 2014 ; chang & lin , 2015 ; jimnez _ et al .",
    "_ , 2015 ) , where the authors attempted to constrain the cosmological isotropy with the opposite hemispheres technique , or assuming anisotropic dark energy models ( blomqvist _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ; mariano & perivolaropoulos , 2012 ; cai _ et al . _ , 2013 ; yang _ et al . _ , 2014 ; chang _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014b ; wang _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) .",
    "these efforts reported the validity of the cp within 2@xmath9 confidence level , with the dipolar directions of maximal anisotropy pointing in the direction of the cosmic anomalies we have mentioned earlier .",
    "the novelty of this work is a directional analysis of the cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 in different sky patches by means of hemispherical comparison , including the investigation whether possible anisotropic signals in such analyses can be correlated with the non - uniform distribution of sne events in the sky ( according to the current catalogs ) .",
    "if a significant correlation is found , this would indicate that such signal could be attributed to observational biases rather than being of cosmological nature .",
    "we use the two latest compilations of sne in order to perform these analyses , namely the union2.1 ( suzuki _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) and the jla datasets ( betoule _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) in a reasonably low - redshift regime ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "this choice has been made as there are approximately one third of the objects in both samples located within this range of redshift and also because of the advantage of carrying out model - independent analyses as pointed out by seikel & schwarz ( 2009 ) and kalus _ et al . _",
    "we use galactic coordinates throughout all our analyses .",
    "in this section we describe our indicator and the procedure to calculate their associated maps , which lead to quantify deviations from statistical isotropy in a given set of cosmic events with known positions on the celestial sphere ( bernui _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ; see also bernui _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) .",
    "our primary purpose is to illustrate the procedure for defining the discrete function @xmath9 on the celestial sphere in order to generate their associated maps , called @xmath11maps , which compared with statistically isotropic simulated maps give us a measure of deviations from isotropy in the data set .",
    "let @xmath12 be a spherical cap region on the celestial sphere , of @xmath13 degrees of aperture , with centre at the @xmath14-th pixel , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the angular coordinates of the center of the @xmath14-th pixel .",
    "both , the number of spherical caps @xmath17 and the coordinates of their center @xmath16 are defined using the healpix pixelization scheme ( grski _ et al . _ , 2005 ) .",
    "the spherical caps are such that their union completely covers the celestial sphere @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the catalog of cosmic objects located in the @xmath14-th spherical cap @xmath20 .",
    "the 2pacf of these objects ( padmanabhan , 1993 ) , denoted as @xmath21 , is the difference between the normalised frequency distribution and that expected from the number of pairs - of - objects with angular distances in the interval @xmath22,\\ , i=1,\\ldots , n_{\\mbox{\\tiny bins}}$ ] , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the bin width .",
    "the expected distribution is the average of normalised frequency distributions obtained from a large number of simulated realisations of isotropically distributed objects in @xmath18 , containing a similar number of objects as in the dataset in analysis .",
    "a positive ( negative ) value of @xmath25 indicates that objects with these angular separations are correlated ( anti - correlated ) , while zero indicates no correlation .",
    "let us define now the scalar function @xmath26 , for @xmath15 , which assigns to the @xmath14-cap , centered at @xmath16 , a real positive number @xmath27 .",
    "we define a measure @xmath9 of the angular correlations in the @xmath14-cap as @xmath28    to obtain a quantitative measure of the angular correlation signatures of the sne sky map , we choose @xmath29 and cover the celestial sphere with @xmath30 hemispheres , then calculate the set of values @xmath31 using eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "patching together the set @xmath32 in the celestial sphere according to a coloured scale ( where , for instance , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) we obtain a sigma - map . finally , we quantify the angular correlation signatures of a given sigma - map by calculating its angular power spectrum .",
    "similar power spectra are constructed , for comparison , with isotropically distributed samples of cosmic objects .",
    "since the sigma - map assigns a real number value to each pixel in the celestial sphere , that is @xmath35 , one can expand it in spherical harmonics : @xmath36 where the set of values @xmath37 , defined by @xmath38 , is the angular power spectrum of the sigma - map . because we are interested in the large - scale angular correlations",
    ", we shall concentrate on @xmath39 .",
    "this test involves the directional analyses of the universe expansion through the mapping of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the celestial sphere . in other words ,",
    "we adopt the opposite hemisphere method to accomplish this .",
    "each pair of these hemispheres is well defined by the healpix pixelization scheme , such that we fit @xmath0 and @xmath1 according to the maximal likelihood technique ( mlt ) in each one of them , and thus constructing the hubble - maps and @xmath40-maps , respectively .",
    "the mlt consists in minimising the quantity    @xmath41    where the set @xmath42 contains the observational information of the sne data , i.e. , redshift , distance moduli and associated uncertainty of the _ i - th _ object , respectively   is the error in the measurement of the sne distance moduli , not to be confused with the discrete function @xmath43 , defined in section  [ sigma - map ] to construct the sigma - map . ] and @xmath44 is the distance modulus @xmath45 } + 42.38 - 5\\log_{10}(h),\\,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the adimensional luminosity distance , whose arguments are the redshift @xmath49 , in addition to the set of cosmological parameters @xmath50 which describe the underlying cosmological model .",
    "once the hubble- and @xmath40-maps have been constructed , it is of great relevance to test their statistical significance . then , we follow two different approaches to accomplish this . in the first test one",
    "keeps the original set @xmath51 of each sne and shuffles their galactic coordinates , as performed , e.g. , by kalus _",
    "this procedure will be called the _ shuffle _",
    "test throughout this paper , whose objective is to check the dependence between each @xmath42 with the sne angular distribution pattern in the sky . assuming that a sn event can occur in any patch of the sky independently of its redshift , it is not expected a dramatic change in the hemispherical asymmetries unless the cosmic expansion and/or acceleration is really anisotropic , or the precision of the dataset is too limited .",
    "the second test also keeps the original @xmath51 , however , the sne positions are randomly chose so the sne are isotropically redistributed on the celestial sphere .",
    "this test will be referred as mc from now on . in this case , we are able to verify the constraining potential of our anisotropy diagnostics in the case of idealistically isotropic datasets .",
    "if any anisotropic signal persists , it must be accounted to a possible violation of the cp , or the limitation of the observational sample .",
    "finally , we should remark that , although mc and shuffle can be carried out for the hubble and q - maps , only the former is actually suitable for the sigma - map .",
    "since the sigma - map only requires the angular position of the sne events , the shuffle test is not convenient for these analyses as it maintains the original sne distribution on the celestial sphere .",
    "thus , as the sigma - map is designed to quantify the uniformity of angular distributions , only the mc realisations will be computed when the sigma - map test is performed .",
    "[ tab : tab_sigma_map ]    .amplitude and celestial position of the maximal sigma - map dipole contribution for the sne union2.1 ( top ) , and the jla datasets ( bottom ) .",
    "remember that this amplitude is given in arbitrary units , and that @xmath52 , \\ , b \\in [ -90^{\\circ},90^{\\circ}]$ ] ; for instance , the north ( south ) galactic pole has coordinates @xmath53 arbitrary and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . in all the cases ,",
    "the error in the angular estimates is @xmath56 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the left of  [ fig10 ] , we can note that , for most @xmath57 , the original data present larger @xmath58s than the simulated datasets except for the dipole coefficient , whose concordance is mildly larger than 1@xmath9 uncertainty . on the other hand , the asymmetry of @xmath0 , @xmath59 , of these simulations does not present significant disagreement with the result obtained from data , as 7.6% of the shuffled realisations",
    "yield @xmath60 of the union2.1 , whereas this number decreases to 3.0% for the mc test . by the same token ,",
    "18.2% of the shuffle test exceed the asymmetry on jla hubble - map ( @xmath61 ) , however this percentage drops to 0.6% when performing the mc realisations .",
    "this result also shows the intrinsic non - uniformity of the angular sne distribution of this sample , as the mc test yields smaller asymmetric signals than the original map when we redistribute the objects in the sky in uniform manner .    in the right panels of both figures , for instance",
    ", we stress the comparison between the @xmath40-maps and the simulated realisations of the union2.1 and jla data . for the first compilation ,",
    "the multipole expansion of the @xmath40-maps clearly indicates a significant asymmetry , as most @xmath57s ( except for the dipole term ) are not reproduced by the simulations we have produced , such that this asymmetry is reflected on the @xmath62 computation , where none of the mc and shuffle realisations exceed the value obtained for the original sample , that is @xmath63 .",
    "although this large asymmetry can not be reproduced by these statistical tests , we notice that this discrepancy is mostly due to the presence of an outlier fit for @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath64 , and that no other hemisphere provide a positive fits for the deceleration parameter except for this",
    ". such large range of values allowed for @xmath1 can be attributed to a low constraining power on @xmath1 from this sne dataset .",
    "hence , it remains inconclusive whether the cosmic acceleration is actually anisotropic or not albeit the low statistical significance of this result .",
    "nevertheless , the jla q - map presents a better agreement with these statistical tests , specially the shuffle test , as shown in the multipole expansion on the right plot of the figure  [ fig11 ] , in addition to the fact that 42.8% of these shuffle realisations present @xmath65 .",
    "however , the mc test , show a smaller concordance with the data , as only 4.2% of the simulations are able to reproduce such anisotropy on the q - map .",
    "as expected , the smaller asymmetry on idealistically isotropic jla samples reinforces the impact of the incomplete sky coverage of these catalog .",
    "it is also worth to discuss that the directions of the maximal and minimal @xmath66 , besides the sigma - map cases , are randomly oriented in both statistical tests , these positions are reproduced by less than 2% of the 500 realisations in all cases with a tolerance of @xmath67 in both latitude and longitude coordinates .",
    "therefore , it is possible to conclude that such directions does not present statistical significances , even though they coincide with other cp probes , and show suggestive concordance with the reports from the literature which have adopted similar methodologies .    to summarise",
    ", we can not conclude that the anisotropical signals found on the union2.1 catalog analyses are influenced by the angular correlations of sne distribution in the sky , together with the reasonably low statistical significance of these results , however , the proximity of the bulk - flow motion directions reported in the literature raises the possibility of being the cause for such signals .",
    "the jla analyses , on the other hand , clearly show that its anisotropic coverage of the sky indeed impact the mapping of cosmological parameters through opposite hemispheres .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to determine any violation of the cp , in this redshift range , with the limitation of the current datasets .",
    "nevertheless , next - generation surveys such as lsst ( abell _ et al . _ , 2009 ) and euclid ( amendola _ et al . _ , 2012 ) may solve this issue with the greater precision , and much larger datasets , that they shall provide .",
    "in this work we have discussed the issue of a possible anisotropic expansion of the universe through a directional analyses , i.e. , investigating the hubble diagrams of sne data located in opposite hemispheres . for completeness",
    ", our analyses also explore the possibility that the results are biased by the anisotropic distribution of the sne data , because they are manifestly under - sampled or over - sampled in several sky patches . for this",
    ", we have firstly used a geometrical method to find possible anisotropic signatures due to the angular distribution of both sne datasets , namely the union2.1 and the jla catalogs .",
    "then we use this information to investigate a possible correlation with the outcomes of the directional studies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , according to our analyses , a correlation exists between the anisotropic distribution of the data ensambles and the anisotropic signatures found in our directional studies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , the jla data shows a large correlation that is statistically significant to suggest that the dipolar direction of the hubble - map can be attributed to the anisotropically distributed sne sample . in the case of the union2.1 catalog ,",
    "this correlation is small .",
    "however , we have verified that the direction of the dipole asymmetry found in the @xmath0 analysis with this dataset correlates well with the well - known direction of the bulk - flow motion , in fact we obtained @xmath68 while the bulk - flow motion of our local group points towards @xmath69 ( turnbull _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "all these results indicate that the dipolar features of the directional hubble diagrams ( which is the dominant anisotropic signal ) can be explained either by the anisotropic sne dataset ( in the case of the jla sample ) or by a systematic effect , that is , the direction of the bulk - flow motion of our local group in the case of the union2.1 catalog .",
    "thus , for the low - redshift regime of the sne analysed here ( @xmath70 ) , we have shown that the observed anisotropic expansion can not guarantee a violation of the cp . despite of this",
    ", one can not discard the hypothesis that our universe is indeed undergoing an anisotropic expansion , which is not observed in the analyses because either it could be of small magnitude or it may be hidden by the uncertainties introduced by the highly non - uniform distribution of current sne data in the celestial sphere ."
