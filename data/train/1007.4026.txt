    "an usual way to present the simple pendulum model in a first course of general physics is to consider a small angular displacement , and in this way to linearize the corresponding second order differential equation @xcite .",
    "this first approximation lead us to conclude that , for small amplitudes , the period of oscillation is independent from the amplitude : @xmath5    in order to present a more realistic expression for the period in the case of larger angles , it was proposed another approximated formula , derived from the complete elliptic integral of first kind @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the initial angular displacement and the amplitude of oscillation , supposing the the pendulum starts at rest .",
    "in fact , series approximations are common in classical mechanics textbooks @xcite , and another approximations were recently proposed @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the exact formula for the large - angle period of a simple pendulum , involving the elliptic integral of the first kind @xmath8 is implemented in most computer algebra systems available in the market . ]",
    "is given by @xcite : @xmath9 belndez _ et al _ @xcite , in a very didactic note , have derived this formula from the integral expression of @xmath10 .",
    "in this brief work we will essentially solve the same problem treated by belndez _",
    "et al _ @xcite , but considering a non - zero initial angular velocity .",
    "we present a closed - form expression for the angular displacement @xmath10 , in terms of the jacobi elliptic function @xmath2 , and of the incomplete elliptical integral of the first kind @xmath3 .",
    "we also made some energy considerations , and derive an expression for the period of oscillation @xmath11 , involving @xmath8 .",
    "we believed that such an exercise can be fruitfully used in order to introduce such concepts as elliptical integrals and functions , to encourage the use of computer algebra systems ( maple@xmath12 , mathematica@xmath12 , etc . ) , and to show how a simple generalization can be carried out .",
    "the dynamics of an ideal simple pendulum is given by the following initial value problem : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is its natural angular frequency , @xmath15 $ ] is the initial angular displacement , and @xmath16 is the initial angular velocity .    following @xcite , we start to solve this second order differential equation , multiplying it by @xmath17 : @xmath18 and noting that it can be rewritten as : @xmath19 = 0\\ ] ] then , integrating this equation on the time interval @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 , we obtain : @xmath22_{0}^{t } = 0\\\\ & \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{d\\theta}{dt } \\right)^2 -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\big{|}_{t=0 } \\right)^2 = \\omega_0 ^ 2 ( \\cos \\theta(t)-\\cos \\theta_0)\\\\ & \\rightarrow \\left ( \\frac{d\\theta}{dt } \\right)^2=2\\omega_0 ^ 2 ( \\cos \\theta(t)-\\cos \\theta_0)+\\phi_0 ^ 2\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] now , the objective is to write this equation in order that , when we integrate it , we will obtain an elliptic integral . to do this , we define the new variables : @xmath23 and rewrite the equation as : @xmath24 where we have used that @xmath25 and that @xmath26 defining @xmath27 @xmath28 follows that : @xmath29 substituting @xmath30 on ( @xmath31 ) yields : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the transformed initial conditions are : @xmath35",
    "@xmath36 taking the square root on both sides of ( @xmath37 ) , and after some algebra , we have that @xmath38 integrating on the interval @xmath39 $ ] we obtain : @xmath40 which is equivalent to : @xmath41\\ ] ] now , we can write these two integrals in terms of the inverse jacobi elliptic function and of the _ incomplete _ elliptical integral of the first kind ( formula 219.00 , pp . 58 , @xcite ) : @xmath42 @xmath43 applying the jacobi elliptic function @xmath44 on both sides of this equation @xmath45 and coming back to the original variables @xmath46 we finally obtain the solution for the angular displacement as a function of time : @xmath47\\ ] ] where @xmath48 observe that expression ( @xmath49 ) represents two possible solutions : there are a plus and a minus signal in front of @xmath50 .",
    "then , we will choose the `` positive branch '' if the initial angular velocity is positive ( @xmath51 ) , and the `` negative branch '' if the initial angular velocity is non - positive ( @xmath52 ) .    in particular , @xmath53 , and ( @xmath49 ) reduces to : @xmath54\\ ] ] from formula 110.06 ( pp .",
    "9 , @xcite ) , the following equality holds : @xmath55 where @xmath8 is the _ complete _ elliptical integral of the first kind . in this way we recover the solution obtained by @xcite for the case of a null initial angular velocity : @xmath56\\ ] ]    in figure 1 we plot the solution ( @xmath57 ) for @xmath58 , using the software mathematica@xmath12 , and in figure 2 the corresponding angular velocity @xmath59 .",
    "the parameters used were : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ( these same values for @xmath63 and @xmath64 will be used in figures 3 and 4 below ) .",
    "the problem that we are analysing is conservative , because the pendulum is only under the influence of earth s gravitational field , that is , we are not considering any kind of dissipative forces .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the kinetic energy in the system at time @xmath65 is given by : @xmath66 where @xmath59 .",
    "the potential energy , considering the lowest level of the pendulum as the reference point , is : @xmath67 then , the sum of these two quantities is constant over time , and equals the mechanical energy , @xmath68 , of the system : @xmath69 in particular , we know the initial angular displacement ( @xmath7 ) and velocity ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "consequently , the mechanical energy is given by : @xmath71 and the following expression must be true for all time : @xmath72 dividing this equation by @xmath73 and multiplying by @xmath74 , we can rewrite it as @xmath75    from ( @xmath76 ) , the angular velocity of the pendulum for the some displacement @xmath10 is given by : @xmath77      for instance , if we want to know what initial angular velocity @xmath70 is necessary , given that we know @xmath7 , to the pendulum stops at its maximum height , we need only to consider @xmath78 and @xmath79 in ( @xmath80 ) , obtaining : @xmath81 in conclusion : if @xmath82 , the pendulum will oscillate forever around its equilibrium point ( its lowest level ) ; if @xmath83 , the pendulum stops at its maximum height ; and if @xmath84 the pendulum will execute a circular motion in relation to its fixing point . in figure 3",
    "we show a graphic with the relation @xmath85 versus @xmath7 .      for @xmath86 , remember that the pendulum s period is given by ( @xmath87 ) : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the period of the pendulum for small oscillations ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "if @xmath91 , we can still use this formula , just replacing @xmath7 by @xmath92 , that is , the maximum angular position where the pendulum stops .",
    "we can obtain this value setting @xmath79 in ( @xmath80 ) , and isolating @xmath93 : @xmath94 then , the period of the pendulum , for any initial position and velocity ( considering @xmath82 ) , is given by : @xmath95 in figure 4 we plot @xmath11 and verify that the pendulum s period is an increasing functions of both @xmath7 and @xmath70 .",
    "in this exercise we have derived a closed - form solution for the angular displacement of a simple pendulum in terms of the jacobi elliptic function @xmath2 , and of the incomplete elliptical integral of the first kind @xmath3 : @xmath96\\ ] ] where @xmath97 and @xmath7 , @xmath70 are the initial angular displacement and velocity , respectively .",
    "finally , such an exercise may be used to initiate advanced undergraduate students to concepts such as elliptical integrals and functions , to the use of computer algebra systems ( maple@xmath12 , mathematica@xmath12 , etc . ) , and to show how a simple generalization can be carried out .",
