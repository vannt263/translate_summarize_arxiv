    "multiparticle production is currently described in terms of color strings stretched between the projectile and the target , which decay into new strings and subsequently hadronize to produce observed hadrons .",
    "color strings may be viewed as small areas in the transverse plane filled with color field created by colliding partons .",
    "with growing energy and size of the colliding system , the number of strings grows , and they start to overlap , forming clusters , in the transverse plane very much similar to disks in two dimensional percolation theory . at a certain critical density",
    "a macroscopic cluster appears that marks the percolation phase transition .",
    "this is the color string percolation model ( cspm ) @xcite .",
    "the interaction between strings occurs when they overlap and the general result , due to the su(3 ) random summation of charges , is a reduction in multiplicity and an increase in the string tension hence increase in the average transverse momentum squared , @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that a cluster of @xmath12 strings that occupies an area of @xmath13 behaves as a single color source with a higher color field @xmath14 corresponding to the vectorial sum of the color charges of each individual string @xmath15 . the resulting color field covers the area of the cluster .",
    "as @xmath16 , and the individual string colors may be oriented in an arbitrary manner respective to each other , the average @xmath17 is zero , and @xmath18 .    knowing the color charge @xmath14 one",
    "can obtain the multiplicity @xmath19 and the mean transverse momentum squared @xmath11 of the particles produced by a cluster of @xmath20 strings @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mean multiplicity and @xmath11 of particles produced from a single string with a transverse area @xmath24 .",
    "this implies a simple relation between the multiplicity and transverse momentum @xmath25 , which means conservation of the total transverse momentum produced .    in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", one obtains an analytic expression @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the color suppression factor and @xmath28 is the percolation density parameter .",
    "eq.(1 ) can be written as @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the critical cluster which spans @xmath31 , appears for @xmath32 1.2 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that cspm is a saturation model similar to the color glass condensate ( cgc ) , where @xmath33 plays the same role as the saturation momentum scale @xmath34 in the cgc model @xcite .",
    "the suppression factor is determined by comparing the @xmath36 and a+a transverse momentum spectra . to evaluate the value of @xmath37 from data for au+au collisions , a parameterization of @xmath36 events at 200 gev is used to compute the @xmath38 distribution @xmath39 where a is the normalization factor . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are parameters used to fit the data . this parameterization also can be used for nucleus - nucleus collisions to take into account the interactions of the strings @xcite @xmath42 the color suppression factor @xmath35 is related to the percolation density parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the initial energy density @xmath1 above @xmath45 is given by @xcite @xmath46 to evaluate @xmath1 we use the charged pion multiplicity @xmath47 at midrapidity and @xmath13 values from star for 0 - 10% central au - au collisions with @xmath48200 gev @xcite .",

    "the schwinger distribution for massless particles is expressed in terms of @xmath60 @xcite @xmath61 where the average value of the string tension is @xmath62 .",
    "the tension of the macroscopic cluster fluctuates around its mean value because the chromo - electric field is not constant .",
    "the origin of the string fluctuation is related to the stochastic picture of the qcd vacuum .",
    "since the average value of the color field strength must vanish , it can not be constant but changes randomly from point to point @xcite . such fluctuations lead to a gaussian distribution of the string tension for the cluster , which transforms sm into the thermal distribution @xcite @xmath63 with @xmath62 = @xmath64 .",
    "the temperature is expressed as @xcite @xmath65 recently , it has been suggested that fast thermalization in heavy ion collisions can occur through the existence of an event horizon caused by a rapid de - acceleration of the colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "the thermalization in this case is due to the hawking - unruh effect @xcite . in cspm the strong color field",
    "inside the large cluster produces de - acceleration of the primary @xmath66 pair which can be seen as a thermal temperature by means of the hawking - unruh effect .",
    "the string percolation density parameter @xmath37 which characterizes the percolation clusters measures the initial temperature of the system .",
    "since this cluster covers most of the interaction area , this temperature becomes a global temperature determined by the string density . in this way at @xmath67 = 1.2 the connectivity percolation transition at @xmath68 models the thermal deconfinement transition .",
