    "the ability to predict the future state of a system , given the present one , stands at the foundations of scientific knowledge with relevant implications from a conceptual and applicative point of view .",
    "the knowledge of the evolution law of the system may induce one to conclude that this aim has been attained .",
    "this is the classical deterministic point of view as clearly stated by laplace @xcite : once the evolution laws of the system are known , the state at a certain time @xmath0 completely determines the subsequent states for every time @xmath1 .",
    "however it is well established now that this can not be accomplished in practice .",
    "one limitation occurs in systems with many degrees of freedom , namely the impossibility to manage the huge amount of data required for a detailed description of a single state of a macroscopic body .",
    "this aspect , which is not discussed in this review , has led to the development of statistical mechanics .",
    "another source of difficulty , which arises even in low dimensional systems , is related to the unavoidable uncertainty in the initial condition . as clearly stated by poincar",
    ", this implies that one can make long - time predictions only if the evolution law does not amplify the initial uncertainty too rapidly .",
    "this aspect had a relevant role in the development of the theory of dynamical chaos .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of predictability , we need to know how an error in the initial state of the system grows in time . in deterministic chaotic systems ,",
    "i.e. , with sensitive dependence on initial condition , one has an exponential growth of errors and , consequently , a severe limitation on the ability to predict the future states .",
    "in addition , since the details of the evolution laws are not completely known ( or , at least , can not be specified with an arbitrary accuracy ) or some degrees of freedom can not be resolved , one has another unavoidable source of unpredictability .",
    "this is also true for systems with discrete states .",
    "a branch of the theory of dynamical systems has been developed with the aim of formalizing and quantitatively characterizing the sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "the lyapunov exponent and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy are the two indicators for measuring the rate of error growth and information produced by the dynamical system .",
    "a complementary approach has been developed in the context of information theory , data compression and algorithmic complexity theory .",
    "nowadays it is rather clear that the latter point of view is closely related to the dynamical systems one .",
    "if a system is chaotic then the predictability is limited up to a time which is related to the first lyapunov exponent , and the time sequence generated from one of its chaotic trajectories can not be compressed by an arbitrary factor , i.e. is algorithmically complex . on the contrary",
    ", a regular trajectory can be easily compressed ( e.g. , for a periodic trajectory it is sufficient to have the sequence for a period ) so it is `` simple '' .    in this review",
    "we will discuss how these points of view are related and how they complete each other in giving a quantitative understanding of complexity arising in dynamical systems .",
    "in particular , we shall consider the extension of this approach , nowadays well established in the context of low dimensional systems and for asymptotic regimes , to high dimensional systems with attention to situations far from asymptotic ( i.e. finite time and finite observational resolution ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that the approach to complexity here discussed is not able to cover the many aspects of what in recent years has been indicated under this term @xcite .",
    "indeed _ complexity _ has been considered in many different fields of science and its meaning has become ( sometimes ) vague . a challenging problem in this direction is the definition of indicators which are able to fulfill the intuitive idea of complexity , namely one looks for quantities which give a low complexity value both for pure random sequences and completely regular ones @xcite .",
    "even if very interesting this last issue is not addressed here : from the point of view of predictability both a chaotic system and a purely random one are highly complex , i.e. unpredictable .",
    "the review is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec:1 ] is devoted to the introduction of the basic concepts and ideas of dynamical systems , information theory and algorithmic complexity . in particular , we discuss the relations among lyapunov exponents , kolmogorov - sinai entropy and algorithmic complexity and their relevance for predictability .",
    "all these quantities are properly defined only in specific asymptotic limits , that are : very long times and arbitrary accuracy . since in realistic situations one has to deal with finite accuracy and finite time  as keynes said , `` in the long run we shall all be dead ''  it is appealing to treat the predictability problem by taking into account these limitations .",
    "this is the subject of sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] where , relaxing the request of infinite time , we discuss the relevance of the finite time fluctuations of the `` effective '' lyapunov exponent .",
    "in addition , relaxing the limit of infinitesimal perturbations , we introduce suitable tools , such as the finite size lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) and the @xmath2-entropy , for the treatment of non arbitrary high accuracy , i.e. non infinitesimal perturbations .",
    "[ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] focus on high dimensional dynamical systems which deserve particular attention . indeed because of the many degrees of freedom , and its interest in applications ( e.g. in weather forecasting ) , it is necessary to consider the detailed behavior of perturbations and not only the asymptotic features ( i.e. long time and infinitesimal amplitudes ) . sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] is devoted to fully developed turbulence ( here introduced as an important prototype of high dimensional system ) and its finite resolution properties in the inertial range .    in sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] we consider the effects of uncertainties on the evolution laws and we discuss systems containing some randomness . in such a situation",
    "there are two ways to approach the predictability : by considering either two trajectories generated with the same realization of randomness , or two trajectories evolving with different realizations .",
    "both approaches are physically relevant in different contexts , and the results can be very different in presence of strong intermittency .",
    "for the sake of completeness in sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] we discuss dynamical systems with discrete states , e.g. , cellular automata .",
    "[ sec:7 ] is dedicated to a discussion on data analysis . in particular",
    "we discuss the use of @xmath2-entropy and fsle for a pragmatic classification of signals .",
    "[ sec:8 ] reports some concluding remarks . in the appendices we discuss some more technical details",
    "[ sec:1 ]      two standard  tightly linked  indicators are largely used to quantify the behavior of a dynamical system with respect to the asymptotic evolution of an infinitesimal uncertainty : the largest lyapunov exponent ( le ) and the kolmogorov - sinai ( or metric ) entropy @xcite .",
    "the characteristic lyapunov exponents are somehow an extension of the linear stability analysis to the case of aperiodic motions .",
    "roughly speaking , they measure the typical rate of exponential divergence of nearby trajectories . in this sense",
    "they give information on the rate of growth of a very small error on the initial state of a system .",
    "consider a dynamical system with an evolution law given , in the case of continuous time , by the differential equation @xmath3 or , in the case of discrete time , by the map @xmath4 in both cases , for simplicity , we suppose that a vector @xmath5 uniquely specifies one state of the system .",
    "we also assume that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are differentiable functions , that the evolution is well - defined for time intervals of arbitrary extension , and that the motion takes place in a bounded region of the phase space .",
    "we intend to study the separation between two trajectories , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , starting from two close initial conditions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .    as long as the difference between the trajectories , @xmath12 , remains small ( infinitesimal , strictly speaking )",
    ", it can be regarded as a vector , @xmath13 , in the tangent space .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath13 is given by the linearized differential equations : @xmath14 or , in the case of discrete time maps : @xmath15 under rather general hypothesis , oseledec @xcite proved that for almost all initial conditions @xmath10 , there exists an orthonormal basis @xmath16 in the tangent space such that , for large times , @xmath17 where the coefficients @xmath18 depends on @xmath19 .",
    "the exponents @xmath20 are called _ characteristic lyapunov exponents_. if the dynamical system has an ergodic invariant measure , the spectrum of les @xmath21 does not depend on the initial condition , except for a set of measure zero with respect to the natural invariant measure .    loosely speaking , ( [ eq:1 - 5 ] )",
    "tells us that in the phase space , where the motion evolves , a @xmath22-dimensional sphere of small radius @xmath2 centered in @xmath10 is deformed with time into an ellipsoid of semi - axes @xmath23 , directed along the @xmath24 vectors .",
    "furthermore , for a generic small perturbation @xmath25 , the distance between a trajectory and the perturbed one behaves as @xmath26.\\ ] ] if @xmath27 we have a rapid ( exponential ) amplification of an error on the initial condition . in such a case , the system is chaotic and , _ de facto _ , unpredictable on the long times . indeed ,",
    "if we put @xmath28 for the initial error , and we want to predict the states of the system with a certain tolerance @xmath29 ( not too large ) , then the prediction is possible just up to a _ predictability time _ given by @xmath30 this equation shows that @xmath31 is basically determined by the largest lyapunov exponent , since its dependence on @xmath32 and @xmath29 is very weak .",
    "because of its preeminent role , very often one simply refers to @xmath33 as `` the lyapunov exponent '' , and one indicates it with @xmath34 .",
    "( [ eq:1 - 6 ] ) suggests how to numerically compute @xmath35 .",
    "we introduce the response , after a time @xmath36 , to a perturbation on @xmath37 , defined as follows : @xmath38 where , again , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are infinitesimal .",
    "the le @xmath41 is obtained by averaging the logarithm of the response over the initial conditions or along the trajectory : @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the time average @xmath44 .",
    "the oseledec s theorem implies that @xmath45 , for large @xmath36 , is a non - random quantity , i.e. for almost all the initial conditions its value does not depend on the specific initial condition .",
    "therefore , for large times , the average in ( [ eq:1 - 8 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "as the typical growth rate of a generic small segment in phase space is driven by the largest le , the sum of the first @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) lyapunov exponents controls the variations of small @xmath46-dimensional volumes in phase space .",
    "this gives us a way to compute the sub - leading lyapunov exponents .",
    "after the selection of @xmath48 non parallel tangent vectors @xmath49 $ ] , one introduces the @xmath46-order response @xmath50 @xcite @xmath51 analogously to the le , it can be shown that @xmath52    let us stress that the lyapunov exponents give information on the typical behaviors along a generic trajectory , followed for infinite time and keeping the perturbation infinitesimally small . in this respect , they are global quantities characterizing fine - grained properties of a system .",
    "the le , @xmath34 , gives a first quantitative information on how rapidly we loose the ability of predicting the evolution of a system .",
    "a state , initially determined with an error @xmath53 , after a time enough larger than @xmath54 , may be found almost everywhere in the region of motion . in this respect , the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks )",
    "entropy , @xmath55 , supplies a more refined information .",
    "the error on the initial state is due to the maximal resolution we use for observing the system . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume the same resolution @xmath2 for each degree of freedom .",
    "we build a partition of the phase space with cells of volume @xmath56 , so that the state of the system at @xmath57 is found in a region of volume @xmath58 around @xmath59 .",
    "now we consider the trajectories starting from @xmath60 at @xmath0 and sampled at discrete times @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) ; in the case of a map one can put @xmath63 .",
    "since we are considering motions that evolve in a bounded region , all the trajectories visit a finite number of different cells , each one identified by a symbol . in this way a unique sequence of symbols @xmath64 is associated with a given trajectory . in a chaotic system , although each evolution @xmath8 is univocally determined by @xmath59 , a great number of different symbolic sequences originates by the same initial cell , because of the divergence of nearby trajectories .",
    "the total number of the admissible symbolic sequences , @xmath65 , increases exponentially with a rate given by the topological entropy @xmath66 however , if we consider only the number of sequences @xmath67 which appear with very high probability in the long time limit  those that can be numerically or experimentally detected and that are associated with the natural measure  we arrive at a more physical quantity called the kolmogorov - sinai or metric entropy @xcite : @xmath68 @xmath55 quantifies the long time exponential rate of growth of the number of the effective coarse - grained trajectories of a system .",
    "this suggests a link with information theory where the shannon entropy measures the mean asymptotic growth of the number of the typical sequences  the ensemble of which has probability almost one  emitted by a source . in the following",
    "we will discuss in more detail the ks - entropy and its relation with the information theory .",
    "here we obtain , by means of a heuristic reasoning , the relation among @xmath55 and lyapunov exponents .",
    "we may wonder what is the number of cells where , at a time @xmath69 , the points that evolved from @xmath70 can be found , i.e. we wish to know how big is the coarse - grained volume @xmath71 , occupied by the states evolved from @xmath60 , if the minimum volume we can observe is @xmath72 .",
    "as stated at the end of the preceding subsection , we have @xmath73 .",
    "however , this is true only in the limit @xmath74 . in this ( unrealistic ) limit , @xmath75 for a conservative system ( where @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 for a dissipative system ( where @xmath78 ) . as a consequence of limited resolution power , in the evolution of the volume @xmath79 the effect of the contracting directions ( associated with the negative lyapunov exponents )",
    "is completely lost .",
    "we can experience only the effect of the expanding directions , associated with the positive lyapunov exponents . as a consequence , in the typical case",
    ", the coarse grained volume behaves as @xmath80 when @xmath60 is small enough . since @xmath81",
    ", one has @xmath82 this argument can be made more rigorous with a proper mathematical definition of the metric entropy . in this case one",
    "derives the pesin relation @xcite @xmath83 because of its relation with the lyapunov exponents  or by the definition ( [ metentro ] )  it is clear that also @xmath55 is a fine - grained and global characterization of a dynamical system .",
    "the metric entropy is an invariant characteristic quantity of a dynamical system @xcite , i.e. given two systems with invariant measures , their ks - entropies exist and they are equal if the systems are isomorphic @xcite .",
    "this intrinsic quantity may be properly defined by means of tools borrowed from the mathematical theory of communication .      in experimental investigations of physical processes",
    ", we typically have access to the system only trough a measuring device which produces a time record of a certain observable , i.e. a sequence of data . in this",
    "regard a system , whether or not chaotic , generates messages and may be regarded as a source of information .",
    "this observation opens the possibility to study dynamical systems from a very interesting point of view .",
    "information has found a proper characterization in the framework of the theory of communication to cope with the practical problem of transmitting a message in the cheapest way without losing information .",
    "the characterization of the information contained in a sequence can be approached by two very different points of view .",
    "the first one , that of information theory @xcite , is a statistical approach , i.e. , it does not consider the transmission of a specific message ( sequence ) but refers to the statistical properties of all the messages emitted by the source .",
    "information theory approach characterizes the source of information , so that it gives us a powerful method to characterize chaotic systems .",
    "the second point of view considers the problem of characterizing a single sequence .",
    "this latter has led to the theory of algorithmic complexity and algorithmic information theory @xcite .      at the end of forties",
    "shannon @xcite introduced rather powerful concepts and techniques for a systematic study of sources emitting sequences of discrete symbols ( e.g. binary digit sequences ) .",
    "originally information theory was introduced in the practical context of electric communications , nevertheless in a few years it became an important branch of both pure and applied probability theory with strong relations with other fields as computer science , cryptography , biology and physics @xcite .    for the sake of self - consistency we briefly recall the basic concepts and ideas about the shannon entropy .",
    "consider a source that can output @xmath84 different symbols ; denote with @xmath85 the symbol emitted by the source at time @xmath36 and with @xmath86 the probability that a given word @xmath87 , of length @xmath88 , is emitted : @xmath89 we assume that the source is stationary , so that for the sequences @xmath90 the time translation invariance holds : @xmath91 .",
    "now we introduce the @xmath88-block entropies @xmath92 and the differential entropies @xmath93 whose meaning is the average information supplied by the @xmath94-th symbol , provided the @xmath88 previous ones are known .",
    "one can also say that @xmath95 is the average uncertainty about the @xmath94-th symbol , provided the @xmath88 previous ones are given . for a stationary source",
    "the limits in the following equations exist , are equal and define the shannon entropy @xmath96 : @xmath97 the @xmath95 are non increasing quantities : @xmath98 ; that is : the knowledge of a longer past history can not increase the uncertainty on the next outcome . in the case of a @xmath99-th order markov process @xmath100 for all @xmath101 .",
    "this is because a @xmath99-th order markov process has the property that the conditional probability to have a given symbol only depends on the results of the last @xmath99 times , i.e. @xmath102    the shannon entropy is a measure of the `` surprise '' the source emitting the sequences can reserve to us , since it quantifies the richness ( or `` complexity '' ) of the source .",
    "this can be precisely expressed by the first theorem of shannon - mcmillan @xcite that applies to stationary ergodic sources : + if @xmath88 is large enough , the ensemble of @xmath88-long subsequences can be partitioned in two classes , @xmath103 and @xmath104 such that all the words @xmath105 have the same probability @xmath106 and @xmath107 while @xmath108 the meaning of this theorem is the following .",
    "an @xmath84-states process admits in principle @xmath109 possible sequences of length @xmath88 , but the number of typical sequences @xmath110 ( those ones in @xmath103 ) effectively observable is @xmath111 note that @xmath112 if @xmath113 .",
    "moreover the entropy per symbol , @xmath96 , is a property of the source . because of the ergodicity it can be obtained by analyzing just one single sequence in the ensemble of the typical ones , and it can also be viewed as a property of each one of the typical sequences . therefore , as in the following",
    ", one may speak about the shannon entropy of a sequence .",
    "the above theorem in the case of processes without memory is nothing but the law of large numbers .",
    "let us observe that ( [ eq : wordstypical ] ) is somehow the equivalent in information theory of the boltzmann equation in statistical thermodynamics : @xmath114 , being @xmath115 the number of possible microscopic configurations and @xmath116 the thermodynamic entropy . this justifies the name `` entropy '' for @xmath96 . under rather natural assumptions it is possible to prove that the shannon entropy , apart from a multiplicative factor , is the unique quantity which characterizes the `` surprise '' @xcite .",
    "let us now mention another important result about the shannon entropy .",
    "it is not difficult to recognize that the quantity @xmath96 sets the maximum compression rate of a sequence @xmath117 . indeed",
    "a theorem of shannon states that , if the length @xmath118 of a sequence is large enough , one can not construct another sequence ( always using @xmath84 symbols ) , from which it is possible to reconstruct the original one , whose length is smaller than @xmath119 @xcite . in other words",
    "@xmath120 is the maximum allowed compression rate .",
    "the relation between shannon entropy and the data compression problem is well highlighted by considering the shannon - fano code to map @xmath121 objects ( e.g. the @xmath88-words @xmath122 ) into sequences of binary digits @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the main goal in building a code is to define the most efficient coding procedure , i.e. the one which generates the shortest possible ( coded ) sequence .",
    "the shannon - fano code is as follows . at first one",
    "orders the @xmath124 objects according to their probabilities , in a decreasing way , @xmath125 .",
    "then the passage from the @xmath124 objects to the symbols @xmath123 is obtained by defining the coding @xmath126 , of binary length @xmath127 , of the @xmath128-th object with the requirement that the expected total length , @xmath129 , be the minimal one .",
    "this can be realized with the following choice @xmath130 in this way highly probable objects are mapped into short code words while the low probability ones are mapped to longer code words . so that the average code length is bounded by @xmath131 and in the limit @xmath132 one has @xmath133 i.e. , in a good coding , the mean length of a @xmath88-word is equal to @xmath88 times the shannon entropy ( apart from a multiplicative factor , due to the fact that in the definition ( [ eq : shannon ] ) of @xmath96 we used the natural logarithm and here we want to work with a two symbol code ) .",
    "an alternative coding method , based on variable length words , is due to ziv and lempel @xcite .",
    "remarkably it is very efficient for data compression and gives the same asymptotic result of the shannon - fano code .",
    "after the introduction of the shannon entropy we can give a more precise definition of the ks - entropy .",
    "consider a trajectory , @xmath134 , generated by a deterministic system , sampled at the times @xmath135 , with @xmath136 .",
    "perform a finite partition @xmath137 of the phase space . with the finite number of symbols @xmath138 enumerating the cells of the partition , the time - discretized trajectory @xmath139 determines a sequence @xmath140 , whose meaning is clear : at the time @xmath141 the trajectory is in the cell labeled by @xmath142 . to each subsequence of length",
    "one can associate a word of length @xmath88 : @xmath144 .",
    "if the system is ergodic , as we suppose , from the frequencies of the words one obtains the probabilities by which one calculates the block entropies @xmath145 : @xmath146 it is important to note that the probabilities @xmath147 , computed by the frequencies of @xmath148 along a trajectory , are essentially dependent on the stationary measure selected by the trajectory .",
    "this implies a dependence on this measure of all the quantities defined below , @xmath55 included .",
    "we shall always understand to consider the natural invariant measure and do not indicate this kind of dependence .",
    "the entropy per unit time of the trajectory with respect to the partition @xmath137 , @xmath149 , is defined as follows : @xmath150 notice that , for the deterministic systems we are considering , the entropy per unit time does not depend on the sampling time @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "the ks - entropy , by definition , is the supremum of @xmath152 over all possible partitions @xcite @xmath153 it is not simple at all to determine @xmath55 according to this definition .",
    "a useful tool in this respect would be the kolmogorov - sinai theorem , by means of which one is granted that @xmath154 if @xmath155 is a generating partition .",
    "a partition is said to be generating if every infinite sequence @xmath156 individuates a single initial point .",
    "however the difficulty now is that , with the exception of very simple cases , we do not know how to construct a generating partition .",
    "we only know that , according to the krieger theorem @xcite , there exists a generating partition with @xmath99 elements such that @xmath157 .",
    "then , a more tractable way to define @xmath55 is based upon considering the partition @xmath158 made up by a grid of cubic cells of edge @xmath2 , from which one has @xmath159 we expect that @xmath160 becomes independent of @xmath2 when @xmath161 is so fine to be `` contained '' in a generating partition .    for discrete time maps",
    "what has been exposed above is still valid , with @xmath162 ( however , krieger s theorem only applies to invertible maps ) .",
    "the important point to note is that , for a truly stochastic ( i.e. non - deterministic ) system , with continuous states , @xmath160 is not bounded and @xmath163 .",
    "we saw that the shannon entropy puts a limit on how efficiently the ensemble of the messages emitted by a source can be coded .",
    "we may wonder about the compressibility properties of a single sequence .",
    "this problem can be addressed by means of the notion of algorithmic complexity , that is concerned with the difficulty in reproducing a given string of symbols .",
    "everybody agrees that the binary digits sequence @xmath164 is , in some sense , more random than @xmath165 the notion of algorithmic complexity , independently introduced by kolmogorov @xcite , chaitin @xcite and solomonov @xcite , is a way to formalize the intuitive idea of randomness of a sequence .",
    "consider a binary digit sequence ( this does not constitute a limitation ) of length @xmath88 , @xmath166 , generated by a certain computer code on some machine @xmath167 .",
    "one defines the algorithmic complexity , or algorithmic information content , @xmath168 of a @xmath88-sequence as the bit length of the shortest computer program able to give the @xmath88-sequence and to stop afterward .",
    "of course , such a length depends not only on the sequence but also on the machine .",
    "however , a result of kolmogorov  @xcite proves the existence of a universal computer , @xmath169 , that is able to perform the same computation a program @xmath170 makes on @xmath167 with a modification of @xmath170 that depends only on @xmath167 .",
    "this implies that for all finite strings : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the complexity with respect to the universal computer and @xmath173 depends only on the machine @xmath167 . at this point",
    "we can consider the algorithmic complexity with respect to a universal computer  and we can drop the machine dependence in the symbol for the algorithmic complexity , @xmath174 .",
    "the reason is that we are interested in the limit of very long sequences , @xmath132 , for which one defines the algorithmic complexity per unit symbol : @xmath175 that , because of ( [ eq : kolmocomplex ] ) , is an intrinsic quantity , i.e. independent of the machine .    now coming back to the two @xmath88-sequences ( [ eq : seq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : seq2 ] )",
    ", it is obvious that the second one can be obtained with a small - length minimal program , i.e. @xmath176 the bit length of the above program is @xmath177 and therefore when taking the limit @xmath132 in ( [ eq : acomplexity ] ) , one obtains @xmath178 . of course @xmath174",

    "in such a case one calls the sequence complex ( i.e. of non zero algorithmic complexity ) or random .",

    "[ sec:3.10 ] that this is not just a subtle mathematical problem .    in order to build a statistical description of spatio - temporal chaos ,",
    "as ruelle pointed out @xcite , one has to require the existence of a good thermodynamic limit for the lyapunov spectrum @xmath443 .",

    "once the existence of a lyapunov density is proved , one can generalize some results of low dimensional systems @xcite , namely the kaplan - yorke conjecture @xcite and the pesin relation ( [ eq:1 - 13 ] ) .",
    "for instance , one can generalize ( [ eq:1 - 13 ] ) to @xmath448 being @xmath449 the step function .",

    "this may not be true @xcite .",
    "indeed , in systems with many degrees of freedom there is room for several choices of the initial perturbation according to the specific problem under investigation ( e.g. , localized on certain degrees of freedom or homogeneous in all the degrees of freedom ) , and it is not obvious that for all of them the time @xmath453 needed to align along the maximally expanding direction is the same .    in general",
    "the situation can be very complicated .",
    "for instance , it is known that , also considering initially homogeneous disturbances , the lyapunov vectors can localize ( permanently or slowly wandering ) on certain degrees of freedom @xcite . of course , this will severely affect the prediction of the future evolution of the system .",
    "indeed , regions of large predictability time could coexist with regions of relatively short predictability time . in ref .",
    "@xcite one finds an abundance of examples displaying this phenomenology . a detailed analysis of this problem is far from the aims of this review ; we just mention that the behavior of the lyapunov vectors can range from a strongly localized regime ( the origin of which can be understood by the analogy with anderson localization of the wave function in disordered potential @xcite ) to localized wandering structures .",
    "in particular , in the latter case there is strong numerical evidence @xcite that for a large class of ( @xmath189-dimensional ) systems the dynamics of the lyapunov vectors ( actually the logarithm of them ) falls into the universality class of the @xmath189-dimensional kpz equation @xcite .    in these situations",
    "the main contribution to the predictability time comes from the time needed for the perturbation to propagate through the system or to align along the maximally expanding direction , which can be of the order of the system size @xcite . as a consequence",

    ".    moreover , the le can also be unsatisfactory if one is interested in perturbations with particular space - time shapes .",

    "convectively unstable systems are rather interesting because , even if the le ( computed in the stationary frame ) is negative , some features of the motion can be highly unpredictable ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:3.8 ] ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the existence of systems with exponentially long ( in the system size ) transients during which the dynamics is essentially unpredictable despite the fact that the le is negative @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , known under the name of _ stable chaos _",
    "@xcite , will be briefly discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec:6.3 ] .    in high - dimensional systems",
    "one is also interested in predicting the behavior of some average observable to achieve a macroscopic description of the system . the coarse grained ( hydrodynamic like ) dynamics may be non trivial , and the largest le , which is related to the fine grained dynamics , is not relevant for characterizing the predictability at a coarse grained level ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:3.9 ] ) .",
    "we conclude this brief overview by mentioning another interesting feature : in spatially distributed systems coherent structures may appear .",
    "they move maintaining for rather long times their shape . in different contexts one can be interested in predicting the evolution of such structures",
    "; e.g. , cyclonic / anti - cyclonic structures in the atmosphere .",
    "a reasonable question could be the prediction of the center and orientation of such structures : limiting to these aspects one can indeed hope to have a rather long predictability time compared to the rough estimate @xmath455 . however , since usually such phenomena arise in fields , whose evolution is ruled by pde , the non equivalence of the norms makes a general approach to the problem unfeasible .",
    "therefore , one has to resort to _ ad hoc _ treatments , based on physical intuition to identify the most suitable norm to be used for the particular needs ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:3.10 ] ) .      in spatially extended systems it is important to understand the way an uncertainty initially localized in some region will spread .",
    "here we study in particular the time needed for a perturbation , initially seeded in the central site of a lattice of coupled maps , to reach a preassigned value at the border of the lattice @xcite ( see also @xcite and sect .",
    "[ sec:3.8 ] ) . in other terms",
    "we wonder about the `` butterfly effect '' starting from the center of the lattice and arriving up to the boundary .",
    "we shall discuss the properties of such time by varying the coupling range from local to non local in the @xmath189-dimensional cml ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we consider two cases : local coupling , i.e. @xmath456 if @xmath457 , and non - local coupling , e.g. @xmath458 where @xmath459 measures the strength of non - locality .",
    "the initial perturbation is on the central site , i.e. @xmath460 we look at the predictability time @xmath31 needed for the perturbation to reach a certain threshold @xmath461 on the boundary of the lattice , i.e. the maximum time , @xmath36 , such that @xmath462 .    for nearest neighbor coupling ,",

    ". thus for local interactions , the predictability is mainly determined by the waiting time @xmath468 , necessary to have @xmath469 , which is roughly proportional to the system size @xmath422 .",
    "this is confirmed by fig .",

    "the main formal difference is the existence of a second inviscid invariant , the enstrophy ( average square vorticity ) . as a consequence , in the limit of high reynolds numbers ,",
    "the energy can not be dissipated by viscosity and one expects a direct cascade of enstrophy . with an input source at intermediate scales , the energy injected into the system",
    "is transferred to large scales by an _",
    "inverse _ cascade .",
    "a large numbers of numerical simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite have demonstrated the universality of the inverse cascade with spectral index very close to the predicted kolmogorov exponents .",
    "the situation is much less clear for what concerns the direct cascade .",
    "the predicted spectral slope ( kraichnan  batchelor spectrum ) is seldom observed and even universality with respect to the forcing or to the form of dissipation is questioned @xcite .",
    "the freely decaying evolution is characterized by the emergence of coherent structures @xcite which eventually dominate the dynamics .",
    "coherent structures are weakly dissipative , rather regular regions of fluids in the turbulent background flow whose interactions can be approximately described by a conservative dynamics @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous emergence of coherent structures makes two - dimensional turbulence a prototype model for geophysical flows @xcite and , most important for our purpose , gives a natural example for illustrating the effects of choosing different error norms .",
    "the equation for describing two - dimensional turbulence is the navier  stokes equation written for the scalar vorticity @xmath594 as @xcite @xmath595 where @xmath596 is the stream function such that @xmath597 and @xmath598 . as customary in direct numerical simulations ,",
    "the dissipation is modified by employing high order viscosity @xmath599 in order to achieve larger reynolds numbers .",
    "the numerical results discussed below are obtained by integrating ( [ eq:3.4 - 1 ] ) by means of a standard pseudo  spectral code on a periodic computational domain with resolution @xmath600 .    the classical theory of predictability in turbulence @xcite studies the evolution of a difference ( or error ) field , defined as @xmath601 where @xmath602 and @xmath603 are solutions of ( [ eq:3.4 - 1 ] ) started from slightly different initial conditions .",
    "the `` error '' is computed from @xmath604 and measured in terms of a given norm which is the subject of our discussion . indeed",
    "the method used for defining the distance between the reference and perturbed field is a delicate point for continuous systems such as navier  stokes equations .",

    "we will consider an initial error given by complete uncertainty at small scales , i.e. @xmath613 for @xmath614 and @xmath615 for @xmath616 .",
    "this assumption is physically justified by the finite resolution of any measurement device and/or the numerical simulation scheme . for an infinitesimal perturbation",

    ", @xmath259 is formally negative .",
    "however , this is only a formal problem . indeed in high reynolds number turbulence",
    "the dissipation time scale is much longer than the dynamical time and we can make use of the effective le @xmath255 ( [ eq:2.1 - 8 ] ) . for @xmath36",
    "much smaller than the dissipation time , we can consider , from any point of view , @xmath255 as the lyapunov exponent of the decaying turbulence .",
    "the exponential growth regime ends at times much smaller than the dissipative time , as soon as the separation of the two fields can not be any more considered infinitesimal and the finite error regime sets in .",

    "the error curves bend and a predictability time estimation with energy norm gives @xmath624 . from figure",
    "[ fig:3.10 - 1 ] we learn at least two lessons .",
    "first ( but not surprisingly ) about half of the predictability time is governed by non - exponential error growth behavior .",
    "this is another demonstration of the little relevance of le for characterizing predictability in realistic complex systems .",
    "the second observation is that the different norms @xmath621 and @xmath622 give qualitatively similar results .",
    "because the error is initially confined to small scales @xmath616 , the vorticity - based norm is always larger than the energy - based norm , but the predictability time is essentially independent of the norm used .",
    "it is not difficult to understand that any eulerian norm would give comparable result . because the error propagates from small to large scales , a norm which emphasizes small scale features ( as the enstrophy norm ) saturates earlier than a large scale based norm ( energy , in our example ) , but the results remain essentially the same .    in figure",
    "[ fig:3.10 - 2 ] we plot the vorticity field of the reference @xmath625 and perturbed field @xmath626 at the predictability time @xmath31 .",
    "although the two fields differ , by definition , by 25% in energy and about 65% in enstrophy , they look still remarkably similar for what concerns the distribution of vortices . most of the large coherent structures are almost in the same positions .    in figure",
    "[ fig:3.10 - 2 ] we also plot the difference field @xmath627 .",
    "the typical bipolar configuration , usually observed in simulations @xcite , indicates that the error is concentrated in correspondence of the vortices and that it is essentially due to the different position of the vortex structures in the two realizations .",
    "this result suggests that a lagrangian measure of the error , based on the vortex positions , would be more suitable for the present system .",
    "for example , to emphasize the limits of the eulerian measure for the error ( [ eq:3.4 - 3],[eq:3.4 - 4 ] ) , consider the limiting case of singular point vortices , where an infinitesimal error in the coordinates gives error saturation and hence zero predictability time . in general , we expect that , in presence of vortices , an eulerian - based measure underestimates the predictability time .",
    "this problem can be overcome by resorting to the natural distance among vortex centers .",
    "we use a vortex tracking algorithm which recognizes and follows vortices during the dynamics .",
    "first we need a definition of vortex , the one here adopted is : a connected region @xmath628 in the computational domain with vorticity maximum @xmath629 larger ( in absolute value ) than a given threshold and vorticity larger than a fraction ( we used @xmath630 ) of the vorticity peak . given the vortex domains @xmath628 , all the physical quantities are computed by integrating inside the domains . for example , vortex circulation is defined as @xmath631 and vortex center @xmath632 is the center of mass computed from the vorticity field .",
    "finally , vortex trajectories are reconstructed by matching center positions at different times .",
    "a lagrangian , vortex - based , measure of the error can , e.g. , be defined as @xmath633 where @xmath632 and @xmath634 are the vortex positions respectively in the reference and perturbed field . in figure",
    "[ fig:3.10 - 3 ] we plot @xmath635 obtained from our simulation .",
    "we observe that at the classical predictability time , the mean vortex separation is @xmath636 , well below the saturation value ( @xmath637 in the periodic computational box ) .",
    "this result is a quantitative confirmation of the observations drawn from figure  [ fig:3.10 - 2 ] , i.e. the existence of an intermediate regime in which the ( finite ) error is ruled by the displacement of the strong coherent structures .",
    "if one is interested in predicting , with some tolerance , positions and intensities of coherent structures , it is possible to have a much larger predictability time .",
    "perhaps , _ fully developed turbulence _",
    "@xcite is the most important instance of high - dimensional chaotic system . to give an example ,",
    "let us consider a classical experiment in fluid dynamics : in a wind tunnel , an air mass conveyed by a large fan impinges some obstacles , which perturb significantly the velocity of fluid particles .",
    "big and small whirls appear , and the flow evolves irregularly in time .",
    "one could wonder whether the features of the flow depend crucially on the physical properties of the fluid , the size and shape of the obstacle , the mean wind velocity , and so on .",
    "it is easy to understand that , with a given geometry the only relevant parameter which characterizes the flow is the reynolds number @xmath638 , where @xmath639 is the mean wind velocity , @xmath422 is the typical size of the obstacle and @xmath640 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "when @xmath641 is very large , i.e. , of the order of a thousand or more @xcite turbulence is called fully developed .",
    "the fundamental physical interest in this regime is motivated by the existence of universal properties with respect to the details of the experimental setup @xcite .",
    "if a velocity probe is placed at some distance past the obstacle , it is possible to record a temporal series that gives us statistical information .",
    "if one sits far enough from the obstacle , there the small - scale properties of the flow do not depend sensitively on the precise site and orientation of the probe , that is the turbulence is approximately homogeneous and isotropic . since the flow is swept across the probe at a mean velocity @xmath639 , that largely exceeds the magnitude of the fluctuations , one can expect that the time record essentially amounts to a one - dimensional spatial section of the velocity field . thus time - scales and length - scales",
    "are interchangeable , this is the essence of the _ taylor hypothesis _ @xcite . assuming the above hypothesis",
    ", we can safely reinterpret temporal variations of the velocity , on an interval @xmath151 , in a fixed - point of the space as spatial increments on scale @xmath642 , at a fixed - time .",
    "the first important result about the expected universality is the behavior of the velocity power spectrum which closely follows a power law decay @xmath643 on a given range of wave - numbers @xcite . at larger wave - number the spectrum falls off with an exponential - like behavior , whereas the form at small @xmath99 ( i.e. large scales ) depends on the mechanism of forcing and/or boundary conditions . for @xmath644",
    "one often observes a self - similar energy spectrum @xmath645 with scaling exponent @xmath646 .",
    "in incompressible decaying turbulence , there are some arguments indicating that asymptotically @xmath647 where the limiting value @xmath648 is observed if initially the spectrum has @xmath649 @xcite .",
    "a typical turbulence spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig:4.1 - 1 ] .",
    "the two crossovers unveil the presence of two characteristic scales : a large excitation scale @xmath650 , associated with the energy containing eddies , and a small dissipation scale @xmath651 , related to the smallest active eddies .",
    "the appearance of a power law in between these two extremes unveils that no other characteristic scale is involved .",
    "a simple and elegant explanation of these experimental findings is due to a.n .",
    "kolmogorov @xcite : in a nutshell , it is assumed the existence of a range of scales where the energy ",
    "injected at the scale @xmath422  flows down ( with a cascade process , as remarked by richardson  @xcite ) to the dissipative scale @xmath423 , where it is dissipated by molecular viscosity . since , practically , neither injection nor dissipation takes place in this interval , it is called the inertial range . in this range",
    "the only relevant quantity is the average energy transfer rate @xmath652 : dimensional counting imposes then a power spectrum @xmath653 in agreement with the experimental observations discussed above .",
    "the scaling for the spectrum is equivalent to a power law dependence for the second order structure function ( sf ) @xmath654 the original kolmogorov theory ( k41 ) assumes self - similarity of the turbulent flow . as a consequence ,",

    "several experimental investigations @xcite have shown that the kolmogorov scaling is not exact and @xmath659 is a nonlinear function ( with @xmath661 as a consequence of the `` 4/5 law '' ) .",
    "this means a breakdown of the self  similarity in the turbulent cascade .",
    "larger and larger excursions from mean values are observed as one samples smaller and smaller scales .",

    "the maximum limit of present computers is about @xmath678 which corresponds to @xmath679 .",

    "the moments of velocity show power law scaling @xmath688 with exponents close to those experimentally observed for fully developed turbulence .",

    "we have thus a chaotic dynamical system with a reasonably small number of degrees of freedom where standard methods of deterministic chaos can be used in order to relate the `` turbulent '' statistical description in terms of structure functions and intermittency , and dynamical properties , such as the spectrum of lyapunov exponents .",
    "the absence of any stochastic term in ( [ eq:4.1 - 2 ] ) makes the shell model a natural model for investigating the predictability problem in turbulence .",

    "the approach in which one treats the random term as an usual time - dependent external force can lead to misleading results , as illustrated in the following example .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional langevin equation @xmath954 where @xmath955 is a white noise and @xmath956 diverges for @xmath957 , like , e.g. , the usual double well potential @xmath958 .",

    "the result obtained for the one dimensional langevin equation can easily be generalized to any dimension for gradient systems if the noise is small enough @xcite .",
    "another example showing the limitations of this approach is provided by the case of stochastic resonance in chaotic systems . in this case ,",
    "in fact , one can find the same qualitative behavior both for a positive and a negative le .",

    "the study of these different aspects of predictability constitutes a useful method for a quantitative characterization of `` complexity '' , suggesting the following equivalences :    the above point of view , based on dynamical systems and information theory , quantifies the complexity of a sequence considering each symbol relevant but it does not capture the structural level .",
    "let us clarify this point with the following example . a binary sequence obtained with a coin tossing is , from the point of view adopted in this review , complex since it can not be compressed ( i.e. it is unpredictable ) .",

    "the main lesson concerns the framework and limitations about the possible well posed questions in prediction and modeling .",
    "the first relevant fact , now well established , is that in presence of deterministic chaos one can not hope to reach an arbitrary accuracy in prediction by merely refining the model .",
    "a less recognized aspect is that the lyapunov exponent is usually not sufficient to characterize the limits of predictability in real situations .",
    "an appropriate generalization of the lyapunov exponent is necessary to account for the large scale properties .",

    "we need the perturbation to be initially very small in some chosen norm @xmath1343 .",
    "then , in order to study the perturbation growth through different scales , one defines a set of thresholds @xmath1344 , e.g. : @xmath1345 with @xmath1346 and @xmath1347 . to avoid saturation on the maximum allowed separation ( i.e. the attractor size )",
    "one has to choose @xmath1348 with @xmath1349 generic points on the attractor .",
    "note that @xmath128 should be larger than @xmath189 but not too large in order to avoid interferences of different length scales .",

    "one lets the system to evolve from @xmath579 up to the desired scale @xmath1344 ensuring the perturbation to be on the attractor and aligned along the maximally expanding direction .",
    "after @xmath1344 is reached , one computes the first time , @xmath1350 , to reach the following threshold , @xmath1351 , and after that the perturbation is rescaled to @xmath1352 , keeping the direction @xmath1353 constant .",
    "this procedure is repeated @xmath124 times for each thresholds obtaining the set of the doubling times @xmath1354 for @xmath1355 error - doubling experiments . now if we introduce the effective doubling rates : @xmath1356 we can define their time averages as the the effective les on the scale @xmath1344 .",

    "@xmath382 may also depend on the norm one chooses .",
    "this fact , apparently disturbing , is however physically reasonable : when one looks at the non linear regime , for instance , for the predictability problem the answer may depend on the involved observable .",

    "a possible problem with the above described method is that we have implicitly assumed that the statistically stationary state of the system is homogeneous with respect to finite perturbations .",

    "[ app : synth ] in this appendix we recall some recently introduced methods for the generation of multi - affine stochastic signals  @xcite , whose scaling properties are fully under control .",
    "the first step consists in generating a @xmath189-dimensional signal , and the second in decorating it such as to build the most general @xmath1442-dimensional process , @xmath851 , with given scaling properties in time and in space .",

    "one is based on a dyadic decomposition of the signal in a wavelet basis with a suitable assigned series of stochastic coefficients @xcite .",
    "the second is based on a multiplication of sequential langevin - processes with a hierarchy of different characteristic times @xcite .",
    "+ the first procedure suits particularly appealing for modeling of spatial turbulent fluctuations , because of the natural identification between wavelets and eddies in the physical space .",
    "the second one looks more appropriate for mimicking the turbulent time evolution in a fixed point of the space .      a non - sequential algorithm for @xmath189-dimensional multi - affine signal in @xmath446 $ ] , @xmath1443 ,",
    "can be introduced as  @xcite : @xmath1444 where we have a set of reference scales @xmath1445 and @xmath1446 is a wavelet - like function @xcite , i.e. of zero mean and rapidly decaying in both real space and fourier - space .",
    "the signal @xmath1443 is built in terms of a superposition of fluctuations , @xmath1447 of characteristic width @xmath1448 and centered in different points of @xmath446 $ ] , @xmath1449 . in @xcite it has been proved that provided the coefficients @xmath1450 are chosen by a random multiplicative process , i.e. the daughter is given in terms of the mother by a random process , @xmath1451 with @xmath1452 a random number identical , independent distributed for any @xmath1453 , then the result of the superposition is a multi - affine function with given scaling exponents , namely : @xmath1454 with @xmath1455 and @xmath1456 . in this appendix @xmath1457 indicates the average over the probability distribution of the multiplicative process .    besides the rigorous proof ,",
    "the rationale for the previous result is simply that due to the hierarchical organization of the fluctuations , one may easily see that the term dominating the expression of a velocity fluctuation at scale @xmath275 , in ( [ diadic1 ] ) is given by the couple of indices @xmath1453 such that @xmath1458 and @xmath1459 , i.e. @xmath1460 . the generalization ( [ diadic1 ] ) to d - dimension is given by : @xmath1461 where now the coefficients @xmath830 are given in terms of a d - dimensional dyadic multiplicative process .",
    "+ on the other hand , as previously said , sequential algorithms look more suitable for mimicking temporal fluctuations .",
    "let us now discuss how to construct these stochastic multi - affine fields . with the application to time - fluctuations in mind , we will denote now the stochastic 1-dimensional functions with @xmath389 .",
    "the signal @xmath389 is obtained by a superposition of functions with different characteristic times , representing eddies of various sizes  @xcite : @xmath1462 the functions @xmath1463 are defined by the multiplicative process @xmath1464 where the @xmath1465 are independent stationary random processes , whose correlation times are supposed to be @xmath1466 , where @xmath1467 ( i.e. @xmath1468 are the eddy - turn - over time at scale @xmath1448 ) in the quasi - lagrangian frame of reference @xcite and @xmath1469 if one considers @xmath389 as the time signal in a given point , and @xmath1470 , where @xmath663 is the hlder exponent . for a signal mimicking a turbulent flow , ignoring intermittency , we would have @xmath672 .",
    "scaling will appear for all time delays larger than the uv cutoff @xmath1471 and smaller than the ir cutoff @xmath213 .",
    "the @xmath1472 are independent , positive defined , identical distributed random processes whose time correlation decays with the characteristic time @xmath1473 .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath1474 determines the intermittency of the process .",
    "the origin of ( [ def : mult ] ) is fairly clear in the context of fully developed turbulence .",
    "indeed we can identify @xmath680 with the velocity difference at scale @xmath1448 and @xmath1474 with @xmath1475 , where @xmath1476 is the energy dissipation at scale @xmath1477 @xcite .",
    "the following arguments show , that the process defined according to ( [ eq : decomp],[def : mult ] ) is multi - affine .",
    "because of the fast decrease of the correlation times @xmath1478 , the characteristic time of @xmath1463 is of the order of the shortest one , i.e. , @xmath1466 .",
    "therefore , the leading contribution to the structure function @xmath1479 with @xmath1480 stems from the @xmath46-th term in ( [ eq : decomp ] ) .",
    "this can be understood nothing that in @xmath1481 $ ] the terms with @xmath1482 are negligible because @xmath1483 and the terms with @xmath1484 are sub - leading .",
    "thus one has : @xmath1485 and therefore for the scaling exponents : @xmath1486 the limit of an affine function can be obtained when all the @xmath1474 are equal to @xmath189 .",
    "a proper proof of these result can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ let us notice at this stage that the previous `` temporal '' signal for @xmath1487 is a good candidate for a velocity measurements in a lagrangian , co - moving frame of reference @xcite .",
    "indeed , in such a reference frame the temporal decorrelation properties at scale @xmath1448 are given by the eddy - turn - over times @xmath1488 .",
    "on the other hand , in the laboratory reference frame the sweeping dominates the time evolution in a fixed point of the space and we must use as characteristic times of the processes @xmath1489 the sweeping times @xmath1490 , i.e. , @xmath1491 .",
    "we have now all the ingredients to perform a merging of temporal and spatial properties of a turbulent signal in order to define stochastic processes able to reproduce in a realistic way both spatial and temporal fluctuations ( [ eq : aggiunta1])-([eq : aggiunta2 ] ) . we just have to merge in a proper way the two previous algorithms .",
    "+ for example , for a d - dimensional multi - affine field such as , say , one of the three components of a turbulent field in a lagrangian reference frame we can use the following model : @xmath1492 where the temporal dependency of @xmath1493 is chosen following the sequential algorithm while its spatial part are given by the dyadic structure of the non - sequential algorithm . in ( [ lagrangian_field1 ] ) we have used the notation @xmath1494 in order to stress the typical lagrangian character of such a field .",
    "+ we are now able to guess a good candidate for the same field measured in the laboratory - reference frame , i.e. where the time properties are dominated by the sweeping of small scales by large scales .",
    "indeed , in order to reproduce the sweeping effects one needs that the centers @xmath1495 of the wavelets - like functions move according a swept - dynamics .    to do so ,",
    "let us define the eulerian model : @xmath1496 where the difference with the previous definition is in the temporal dependency of the centers of the wavelets , @xmath1497 . according to the richardson - kolmogorov cascade picture",
    ", one assumes that sweeping is present , i.e. , @xmath1498 where @xmath825 labels the `` mother '' of the @xmath1499-eddy and @xmath1500 is a stochastic vector which depends on @xmath1501 and evolves with characteristic time @xmath829 .",
    "furthermore , its norm is @xmath1502 : @xmath1503 where @xmath1504 and @xmath1505 are constants of order one .",
    "+ we now see that if we measure in one fixed spatial point a fluctuations over a time delay @xmath908 , is like to measure a simultaneous fluctuations at scale separation @xmath1506 , i.e. due to the sweeping the main contribution to the sum will be given by the terms with scale - index @xmath1507 while the temporal dependency of the coefficients @xmath1508 will be practically frozen on that time scale .",
    "therefore , one has the proper spatial and temporal statistics , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "this happens because in presence of the sweeping the main contribution is given by the displacement of the center at large scale , i.e. @xmath1509 , and the eddy turnover time at scale @xmath1448 is @xmath1510 always large that the sweeping time @xmath1502 at the same scale .",
    "+ in the previous discussion for the sake of simplicity we did not consider the incompressibility condition .",
    "however one can take into account this constraint by the projection on the solenoidal space . + in conclusion we have a way to build up a synthetic signal with the proper eulerian ( laboratory ) properties , i.e. with sweeping , and also with the proper lagrangian properties .",
