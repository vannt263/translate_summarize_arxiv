    "in the middle of the 1970 s , after works by many authors to endow some particular manifolds with foliations , w. thurston published fundamental existence theorems for all compact manifolds .",

    "not only his main result @xcite builds a foliation @xmath0 of codimension one on every closed manifold whose euler charasteristic is null , but it allows to prescribe the homotopy class of the hyperplane distribution tangent to @xmath0  , and also the homotopy class of @xmath0 regarded as a haefliger structure @xcite . recall that every manifold of dimension at least 3 carries an unnumerable infinity of such classes @xcite .",
    "it is notorious @xcite that the subsequent study of foliations was strained by the widely spread feeling that these works were difficult . actually , both proofs given in @xcite follow the same scheme of construction in three steps .",
    "first one makes a foliation with `` holes '' , that is , parts of the manifold left unfoliated .",
    "second , a substantial construction extends the foliation into them .",

    "the idea grew that this certainly nonelementary tool was unavoidable ( and/or the simplicity of @xmath3  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite  , for which thurston calls in some constructions of codimension one foliations in dimension 3 ) , despite the fact that in 1976 thurston himself did not write so .     currently , _",

    "@xcite    also , in view of the importance of novikov s closed leaf theorem for the study of foliations in dimension 3 , the question was raised to what extent closed manifolds of dimension at least 4 and whose euler characteristic is null carry foliations of codimension 1 without compact leaf .",
    "schweitzer proved @xcite that every such manifold admits such a foliation of class @xmath4  , whose tangent distribution homotopy class and whose concordance class may moreover be prescribed .",
    "the present paper aims both to answer completely this question and to reprove thurston s theorem in all dimensions by the only means of elementary differential topology .",
    "it does nt call for any result concerning diffeomorphisms groups , nor the homotopy type of classifying spaces .",

    "it works in all differentiability classes .",
    "the object under consideration is a _ haefliger structure _ of codimension one  more briefly a _",

    "it can be defined on a manifold @xmath6 as a rank - one real vector bundle over @xmath6  , the `` microbundle '' @xmath7  , together with , in its total space , along the zero section @xmath8  , a germ @xmath9 of codimension - one foliation transverse to every fibre .",
    "the _ singularities _ are the points in @xmath6 where @xmath10 is not transverse to @xmath9  .",

    "that is , @xmath6 is assumed smooth ( @xmath21 ) , and all foliations and @xmath5-structures are understood of class @xmath22  , i.e. globally @xmath19 and tangentially @xmath21  . in particular , a continuous tangent hyperplane distribution exists even for @xmath23  .",

    "then  :    \\(1 ) ( thurston @xcite ) there is a foliation on @xmath6 homotopic to @xmath9 and whose gradient is homotopic to @xmath25  ;    \\(2 ) if moreover @xmath26  , then there is a _ minimal _",
    "foliation on @xmath6 homotopic to @xmath9 and whose gradient is homotopic to @xmath25  .",
    "`` minimal '' meaning of course that all leaves are dense . in dimension 3 ,",
    "another proof of ( 1 ) was recently given @xcite , different from that of the present paper , and which also uses only elementary means , and builds a foliation of much more explicit structure than we do here .",
    "every closed , connected manifold of dimension at least @xmath27 and whose euler characteristic is null , admits a smooth minimal foliation of codimension one .",
    "for example , @xmath28 and @xmath29 do .",
    "so , in higher dimensions and in the general frame of smooth foliations of codimension 1 , there seems to be nothing like novikov s closed leaf theorem .",
    "although it answers a question usually considered open , actually this corollary is not new . in paragraphs 2 to 6 of @xcite , on an arbitrary closed manifold whose dimension is at least 4 and whose euler characteristic is null , is manufactured a smooth foliation which is by construction without compact leaf .",
    "a very little more care in thurston s method makes it minimal .",
    "so , this corollary is a _",
    "`` new theorem in thurston 76 '' .",
    "_ on the contrary , the existence of a foliation _ smooth _ and _ minimal , _ _ in every homotopy class of @xmath5-structures , _ is new .",
    "the proof of theorem a is constructive and essentially local : one performs explicit local modifications of @xmath9 and @xmath25 until @xmath9 is regular and negatively transverse to @xmath25  .",
    "to force these modifications to be homotopies , eventually @xmath9 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) is previously given locally a reflection symmetry , and the modification is then applied twice , respecting this symmetry .",
    "this elementary trick spares , at the end of the construction , any need to adjust the @xmath5-structure class .",
    "the final regularization step is much as in @xcite : the singular set having been given the form of round singularities @xcite , each of them is eliminated by a turbulization , at the cost of leaving a `` hole '' , that is , a part of the manifold left unfoliated .",
    "the hole is then filled by thurston s construction .",
    "more precisely , the proof consists in the following steps .    _ morsifying the @xmath5-structure  _ in class @xmath30  , it is immediate , by a small generic homotopy , to make @xmath9 morse - singular , and smooth in a neighborhood of its singularities .",
    "the same result is also achieved in the lower differentiability classes , but requires different and less immediate methods .",
    "_ minimizing the @xmath5-structure",
    " _ then one easily makes @xmath9 minimal by local modifications .",
    "thanks to the symmetry trick , its homotopy class is not changed .    _ morsifying the contact  _ a pseudogradient @xmath31 is fixed for the morse @xmath5-structure @xmath9  .",
    "one may think to @xmath25 and to @xmath31 as twisted vector fields , see paragraph [ twisted ] .",
    "one defines the _ negative contact locus _ @xmath32 as the set of points where @xmath25 and @xmath31 are nonpositively colinear .",
    "one considers the field @xmath33 tangential to @xmath9 obtained as the projection of @xmath25 into @xmath34 parallelly to @xmath31  .",
    "thus for each leaf @xmath35 of @xmath9  , the restriction @xmath36 is a vector field on @xmath35  , singular at every point of @xmath37  .",
    "after local homotopies of @xmath9 and @xmath25  , all these singularities are given the morse form .",
    "the negative contact locus becomes a union of arcs , each of which @xmath38 $ ] is transverse to @xmath9 except at its origin @xmath39 and extremity @xmath40  , which are a pair of singularities of @xmath9 of successive indices @xmath41  , @xmath42 ( _ bisingular arc _ ) .",
    "the union of @xmath43 with a second arc , also transverse to @xmath9  , whose origin is @xmath40 and whose extremity is @xmath39  , constitutes a _",
    "bisingular circle .",
    "_    _ symmetrizing  _ after homotopies of @xmath9 and @xmath25  , these circles are encapsuled by pairs into some domains of @xmath6 where @xmath9 and @xmath25 are both invariant by some reflection symmetry , and out of which @xmath9 is negatively transverse to @xmath25  . to get this ,",
    "the morse form that the contact has been given is crucial .    _",
    "rounding the singularities  _ after a classical method of asimov , each pair of morse singularities is easily changed into a pair of round ones .    _ turbulizing the round singularities  _ each round singularity is eliminated by turbulization , at the cost of leaving in the manifold some unfoliated _ hole .",
    "_ this is immediate .    _",
    "filling the holes  _ each hole is filled by a foliation . here",
    "we follow thurston .",
    "the argument is given in details in an appendix , for the sake of completeness , and also because , as said before , the regularization of haefliger structures of codimension one has been for long believed to require difficult tools .",
    "i have simplified some part of thurston s argument , but it remains substantial .    to fix ideas , in this paper",
    "it is assumed that @xmath6 is closed .",
    "it is immediate to generalize theorem a and its proof to @xmath5-structures on manifolds with boundaries , as follows .",
    "one adds to the hypotheses of the theorem that @xmath25 is tangential to @xmath44 and that @xmath9 is already negatively transverse to @xmath25 on @xmath44  ; and concludes that after homotopies of @xmath9 and @xmath25 relative to @xmath44  , the @xmath5-structure @xmath9 becomes negatively transverse to @xmath25 on @xmath6  , and moreover minimal if @xmath26  .",
    "for example , for any two linear foliations of codimension one @xmath45  , @xmath46 on the 3-torus @xmath47  , one easily makes a smooth foliation @xmath0 on @xmath48 $ ] such that @xmath49 ( @xmath18 ) . after the generalization of theorem",
    "a , one can moreover make @xmath0 without interior leaf , which is much less straightforward .    also , the theorem and its proof adapt to the case of _ tangential _ boundaries provided that their first homology group is nonzero , just like in @xcite  this generalization",
    "is left as an exercise .",
    "also , the methods given here go not only in every class @xmath19  , @xmath20  , but more generally for @xmath50-structures , where @xmath50 is any pseudogroup of local transformations of the real line @xmath51 ( that is , if one likes better , an open subgroupoid of the groupoid @xmath52 of germs of homeomorphisms of @xmath51  ) which verifies the following :    _ every nonempty open subset of @xmath51 has a finitely generated group of homeomorphisms with compact support , noncommutative , belonging to @xmath50  , and which has a locally dense orbit .",
    "_    for example , theorem a holds as well in the transverse `` differentiability '' classes @xmath53  , diadic @xmath53  , @xmath54     also , the constructive character of our proof gives at hand a parametric version . to fix ideas , restrict to the smooth class . given a manifold @xmath6 and a rank - one vector bundle @xmath55  , the space @xmath56 of smooth @xmath5-structures on @xmath6 whose microbundle is @xmath55  , is endowed with the @xmath21 topology on germs of hyperplane fields .",
    "let @xmath6 be a closed , connected manifold , @xmath55 a rank - one vector bundle over @xmath6 which admits an embedding @xmath25 into @xmath12  , and let @xmath57 be a compact subset .",
    "then there exist an embedding @xmath58 of @xmath55 into @xmath12 , homotopic to @xmath25  , and a continuous map  : @xmath59,\\nu)\\ ] ] such that for each @xmath60  , one has @xmath61  , while @xmath62 is negatively transverse to @xmath58   and thus in particular , regular .",
    "if moreover @xmath63  , then one can arrange that every @xmath62 is minimal .",
    "for example , on any closed manifold whose euler characteristic is null , any compact family of transversely oriented @xmath5-structures can be continuously homotoped to foliations negatively transverse to a same nonsingular vector field , whose homotopy class can moreover be prescribed .    [ onto ] the inclusion of @xmath64 into @xmath56 is @xmath65-surjective for every @xmath66  . if @xmath63  , then the inclusion of @xmath67 into @xmath56 is @xmath65-surjective for every @xmath66  .",
    "the question whether @xmath56 is 1-connected relatively to @xmath64  , remains open .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank franois laudenbach for generously sharing his interrogations about the actual status of mather - thurston s theorem , and of the simplicity of diffeomorphism groups , in the construction of foliations ; and for his listening and observations all along this work .",

    "one will , through successive homotopies of @xmath9 and @xmath25  , make @xmath9 minimal ( except in dimension 3 ) and negatively transverse to @xmath25 ( thus in particular , regular ) .",

    "this is verified e.g. by induction on @xmath640  : if @xmath1031 exists then the boundary of a tubular neighborhood of @xmath1032 in @xmath1033 is an embedded @xmath1034 with trivial normal bundle .",
    "next , any point of @xmath1030 interior to @xmath1035 is the common center of two hyperspheres between which @xmath1035 lies , hence actually  : @xmath1036 obviously the projection to @xmath1037 is of degree one .",
    "let the torus of dimension @xmath1043 be embedded into the interior of @xmath1027 with trivial normal bundle and such that the projection to @xmath901 is of degree one .",
    "after excision of a tubular neighborhood of this torus , one gets  : @xmath1044 endow the fundamental group @xmath904 with the representation @xmath1045 where @xmath1046 is the linking number of the loop @xmath1047 with the @xmath897-torus .",
    "this linking number is well defined , since @xmath1027 is simply connected , and since in @xmath1027 the poincar - dual of the torus is null on every absolute 2-cycle .",
    "the linking number restricts to the two connected components of the boundary of @xmath614 as follows .",
    "the restriction to @xmath1048 is by nature poincar - dual to the parallel @xmath1049  . likewise , the restriction of @xmath139 to @xmath1050 is poincar - dual to the parallel @xmath1051  , because the projection of the @xmath897-torus to @xmath901 is of degree one .",
