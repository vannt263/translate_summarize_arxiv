    "one of the most striking results from analyses of _ herschel _ data is that filaments in the gould belt clouds are found to exhibit a narrow distribution of average cross - sectional widths @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contains filaments spanning more than two orders of magnitude in column density .",
    "this finding seems to contradict the expectation that filaments should contract ( due to gravity ) and hence increase in density while decreasing in radius .",
    "though the existence of this characteristic scale is still poorly understood , it has been suggested that it must be connected to some physical mechanism , perhaps one involved in filament formation @xcite .",
    "qualitative arguments have connected this characteristic scale to the transition from supersonic to trans - sonic turbulence @xcite and to the ambipolar diffusion length scale ( for both gravitationally unbound and bound structures * ? ? ?",

    "simple analytical models propose that the independence of filament width from column density may be a result of the balance between accretion onto the ( self - gravitating ) filaments and dissipation of the turbulence within them @xcite .",
    "@xcite offered pressure confinement of isothermal cylinders as a possible model for self - gravitating filaments .",
    "most recently , @xcite proposed a model in which filaments are magnetic ribbons , produced by large - scale , trans - alfvnic turbulent flows in a strong magnetic field .",
    "their model is able to reproduce average widths that vary within a factor of two across two orders of magnitude in column density .",
    "however , simulations which either include self - gravity and neglect magnetic fields or vice versa have yet to reproduce the observed distribution and independence on column density @xcite .",
    "@xcite simulated isothermal , self - gravitating , magnetized clouds with super - alfvnic driven turbulence .",
    "his finding is that filament widths are peaked at 0.1 pc and appear constant for one order of magnitude in column density , when turbulence is operating .",
    "the proposed explanation is that the characteristic width is set by the dissipation of turbulence in shocks .",
    "his model , however , fails to reproduce the correlation between filament and magnetic field orientations found in molecular clouds with _",
    "planck _ @xcite .",
    "one particularly puzzling observation regarding the apparent characteristic width of filaments is the absence of its imprint on the spatial power spectra of _ herschel _ cloud images @xcite .",
    "the spatial power spectrum of the 250 @xmath3 m map of the translucent non - star - forming polaris flare is well fit by a power law from @xmath4 pc to @xmath5 pc @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the distribution of filament widths in this cloud is found to have a prominent peak at 0.05 @xmath0 0.07 pc @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is found in the chamaeleon molecular cloud complex , where filament widths are peaked around 0.12 pc with a spread of 0.04 pc @xcite .",
    "however , these authors find no indication of a typical filament width in the @xmath6-variance spectra @xcite of the clouds , even though the signature of cores and clumps is easily identified as a change in the slope of the @xmath7-variance spectrum at the corresponding size scales .",
    "motivated by this apparent discrepancy , in this work we retrace the steps in the analyses of filament width distributions . in section [ sec : methods ] , we briefly describe the analysis used for constructing the distribution of filament widths .",
    "we first perform this analysis on an artificial filamentary image with no characteristic scale and find the distribution of widths to have a broad peak ( section [ sec : fractal ] ) .",
    "we then repeat the analysis on _ herschel _ data of three clouds ( the polaris flare , aquila and ic 5146 , section [ sec : distros ] ) , showing that the narrow spread of the distribution of widths found in previous studies is likely a consequence of averaging along filaments .",
    "the constancy of filament widths may therefore not be inferred from this spread .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the position of the peak of the distribution of widths and find that it is likely a result of the choice of range within which the filament width has been measured ( section [ sec : explanation ] ) .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in order to reproduce the distributions of filament widths for the three clouds presented in @xcite ( the polaris flare , aquila , and ic 5146 ) , we follow an analysis similar to their study .",
    "we use primarily the _ herschel _ spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ) maps of these clouds at 250 @xmath3 m , unless explicitly stated otherwise in the text .",
    "first , we employ the discrete persistent structures extractor ( disperse , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to identify the filamentary structures in each image . disperse analyses",
    "the topology of a given map and extracts its skeleton , which corresponds to the ridges of elongated structures .",
    "we select the parameters of disperse so that the resulting skeletons are visually similar to those shown in the previous studies of the three clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ic 5146 , figure 3 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aquila , figure 3 ) , .",
    "the values of the parameters used are given in appendix [ sec : skeletons ] .",
    "next , we provide the skeleton of disperse and the corresponding _ herschel _ image of each cloud as input to the filament trait - evaluated reconstruction ( filter ) code @xcite .",
    "the objective of filter is twofold : first , it post - processes the skeleton of disperse to only include continuous , non - spurious , structures ( e.g. peaked well above the noise level ) .",
    "this is done by taking cross - sections at every pixel along the filament ridge and assessing each intensity profile .",
    "profiles that are not peaked around the filament ridge and above the noise - level are rejected .",
    "second , filter measures the width of each intensity profile along a filament .",
    "the width is defined as the fwhm of a gaussian fit ( with offset ) to the inner - most part of the profile ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "in order to find this value automatically for every profile , gaussians are fit iteratively to smaller and smaller distances from the filament ridge . the initial range used for fitting is a free parameter of the algorithm . as has been shown by @xcite , the distance up to which a gaussian is fit is crucial in the determination of the width , as at larger distances the fit tends to miss the inner - most part of the profile . in each section",
    "we shall state explicitly which starting value for the fitting range has been used . at the end of the iteration , the most frequent fwhm is assigned as the width of the profile , after deconvolution from the beam size .",
    "the deconvolved width is found ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xmath8 , where hpbw is the half - power beam width of the map ( 18for 250 @xmath3 m , which corresponds to 0.013 pc , 0.023 pc , and 0.04 pc at the assumed distances to the polaris flare , 150 pc , aquila , 260 pc , and ic 5146 , 460 pc , respectively ) .",
    "finally , only sufficiently elongated structures ( with at least a 3:1 length to mean width ratio ) are included in the final sample of filaments that we consider for further analysis .",
    "the post - processed skeletons of the three _ herschel _ images used in this work are shown in appendix [ sec : skeletons ] .",
    "filter provides two different ways of constructing width distributions :    * a distribution of the fwhm measured at all points along the spines of filaments can be created .",
    "information on the structure to which each measurement belongs is discarded in this way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we refer to this kind of distribution as the distribution of all profile widths . *",
    "a distribution of the mean fwhm of filaments can be constructed .",
    "this second type of distribution has been found to show a `` characteristic width '' in previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we refer to this type of distribution as the distribution of filament - averaged widths ( or of mean filament widths ) .    with filter the mean width of each filament",
    "is found by taking the average value of the fwhm measured at each point ( pixel ) along the filament ridge . in other studies ,",
    "the mean width has been found by fitting a gaussian to the mean filament profile e.g. @xcite . in the work of @xcite ,",
    "a non - parametric width determination is also used when gaussian fitting is not possible . in the following analysis",
    "we find the mean width of a filament by averaging the fwhm of all its profiles , as this process is automated , objective , and easily reproducible .",
    "we note that the method used to calculate the average width of a filament should not affect the statistical properties of the distribution of mean filament widths ( mean and spread ) , as long as a large number of filaments is used . indeed , the difference between our approach of measuring mean filament widths and that of other studies does not affect the properties of the distributions of mean filament widths , as both the mean and spread are in good agreement with those of @xcite ( section [ sec : distros ] ) .",
    "the scale - free spatial power spectrum of the _ herschel _ polaris flare image ( at 250 @xmath3 m ) is in tension with the existence of a `` characteristic '' width of the filaments in the same image @xcite .",
    "it may be argued that in some circumstances , the imprint of a characteristic scale on the spatial power spectrum is `` hidden '' .",
    "we use simple artificial images to explore if such a situation may arise , in appendix [ sec : powerspectra ] .",
    "we demonstrate that if structures with a characteristic scale are introduced , an imprint of this scale is apparent in the spatial power spectrum @xmath0 as long as the structures are easily discernible from background noise , as is the case for filaments in the polaris flare .    in this section",
    "we explore the opposite situation : whether a preferred scale can arise from analysing an image with a scale - free spatial power spectrum . to this end",
    ", we create a scale - free image and perform the analysis described in section [ sec : methods ] .    to construct the image we use the ridged multifractal model from the suite of noise - synthesis models implemented in the python library pynoise ( http://pynoise.readthedocs.io ) .",

    "we resample the distribution of intensities and calculate the median of the resampled distribution 100 times .",
    "the error on the median is the standard deviation of these 100 median values .",

    "the existence of a peak in the distribution of widths of the structures extracted by disperse in this image is inconsistent with its scale - free ( power - law ) spatial power spectrum .",

    "having identified the signature of a characteristic scale on the power spectrum , we now investigate the circumstances under which it may be possible to ` hide ' such a signature in a way that it does not appear in the power spectrum .",

    "however , upon visual inspection , these images can be divided into three categories : ( i ) the residuals exhibit a systematic offset from the fit , but at a level less than 0.2 , ( ii ) only a single point in the power spectrum samples the range of scales used , or ( iii ) most filaments overlap at a certain part of the image , so their individual filamentary structure is not visible . in the first case ,",
    "the systematic offset of neighbouring data points is distinct from the random fluctuation of the residuals in the pink noise image .",

    "an offset is observed at data points outside but neighbouring to the range considered . in the last case",
    ", the imprint of the larger ` cluster ' dominates the power spectrum and these images can not be considered as being comprised of filaments .",
    "finally , we introduce pink noise with very large amplitude ( maximum intensity @xmath230% that of the largest filament spine intensity ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : noisefils ] .",
    "the filaments in this image are the same as in fig .",

    "however , the filaments are barely distinguishable from the background noise , which is in stark contrast to observations of clouds .",
    "we conclude that the existence of a characteristic scale should appear in the spatial power spectrum of an image ( e.g. as a change in the spectral slope ) , provided that the structure is easily discernible from the background . in the case of the spatial power spectrum of the polaris flare @xcite",
    ", no such change exists in the power spectrum at or near the spatial scale corresponding to the `` characteristic '' width ( of the very prominent filaments ) at 0.1 pc .",
    "in section [ sec : distros ] we saw that the distributions of all profile widths and of filament lengths are necessary but not sufficient pieces of information to explain the spread of the distribution of mean filament widths ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the goal of this section is to model the variation of widths along the ridge of a filament . using this information",
    ", we will be able to explain quantitatively how one obtains a distribution with @xmath13 when averaging the widths from the parent distribution of all profile widths .",
    "we choose to model the variation of profile widths along a filament using an auto - regressive - moving - average ( arma ) process ( for a complete description of arma modelling , we refer the reader to * ? ? ?",
    "each filament is regarded as a series of @xmath32 widths , @xmath33 , measured at all positions ( pixels ) , @xmath34 , along the filament crest .",
    "the difference between the width at point @xmath35 along the filament crest and the mean width can be written as the regression : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the difference of the width of the point previous to @xmath35 from the mean width , @xmath38 is measured two points away , and so on .",
    "depending on the order @xmath20 of the auto - regressive ( ar ) part of the equation ( coefficients @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 can have a dependence on the width measured @xmath20 points away from position @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath41 is the residual , what is not taken into account by the ar terms .",
    "it is assumed random and normally - distributed . the terms containing the residuals at different positions are the moving - average terms ( ma ) and",
    "their number @xmath42 is the order of the ma part of the model .",
    "we wish to model the variation of widths along a filament , based on the data in the polaris flare . in order to find an appropriate model , we must first decide on the order of the model to be fit .",
    "the order of the arma model ( @xmath20 , @xmath42 ) can be determined by examination of the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions ( acf , pacf ) of the widths of filaments in the polaris flare for @xmath20 and @xmath42 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the acf is defined as ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath43 where @xmath32 is the number of profiles in a filament , @xmath44 is the distance ( lag ) measured along the filament ridge , @xmath33 is the width of the @xmath45 profile along the ridge and @xmath46 is the average width of the filament . finally , @xmath47 is the standard deviation of profile widths in the filament .",
    "the pacf at a given lag is the autocorrelation at this lag after removal of an ar model of order lag minus 1 .",
    "this means that the pacf will be zero at this lag if the ar model effectively removes all correlation .",
    "[ fig : acf ] shows the acf of widths of all filaments in the polaris flare versus distance along the filament ridge .",
    "the acf drops abruptly and stays around zero for distances larger than approximately twice the beam size ( hpbw = 0.013 pc , dashed vertical line ) . for most filaments ,",
    "widths are strongly correlated only within the beam size .",
    "this corresponds to a lag of 3 pixels , and therefore this is the order of the ar process ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the acf of filaments in ic 5146 and aquila also follow this trend ( for ic 5146 hpbw = 0.04 pc , and for aquila hpbw = 0.023 pc ) . in fig .",

    "the vertical line shows the hpbw ( beam size ) of 0.013 pc",
    ". the plot has been truncated at a distance of 2 pc for clarity . ]      therefore , the ( mean - subtracted ) widths along filaments in the polaris flare can be modelled with @xmath20 = 3 ar terms and @xmath42 = 1 ma term : @xmath49 we fit equation [ eqn : arma ] to the series of widths of each filament in the polaris flare .",
    "we wish to obtain a single model that on average reproduces well the variation of widths along any filament in the cloud .",
    "this model is equation [ eqn : arma ] where the value of each coefficient is equal to the median of values returned by fitting the equation to each filament .",
    "the median values of the coefficients from the fits to individual filaments are @xmath50 .    as seen in section [ sec : distros ] , the observed @xmath13 can not be explained by only taking into account the distributions of all profile widths and filament lengths .",
    "we will now estimate what part of @xmath13 can be attributed to the combined contribution of the correlation between the widths of neighbouring profiles , and the distribution of filament lengths .",
    "we note that the information on the distribution of all profile widths is included in the arma model , as the coefficients were found by fitting to real data .    to this end",
    ", we create 100 groups ( filaments ) of ( mean - subtracted ) widths in the following way .",
    "a number of profiles for each filament is drawn from the distribution of filament lengths in the polaris flare .",
    "each filament is assigned a starting value drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation equal to that of the distribution of @xmath41 from the fits to individual filaments .",
    "this starting value corresponds to the mean - subtracted width of the first filament profile .",
    "consecutive ( mean - subtracted ) profile widths are found iteratively using equation [ eqn : arma ] .",
    "we then calculate the average width of each filament .",
    "the distribution of average filament widths has a spread of 0.011 pc , similar to the observed @xmath13 of 0.014 pc in the cloud .",
    "this process is repeated 100 times to quantify whether the difference ( 0.014 pc versus 0.011 pc ) is significant . we find that the observed @xmath13 is within the spread of the results of the simulation .",
    "we have found that @xmath13 can be predicted based on three pieces of information : the distribution of all profile widths , the distribution of filament lengths , and the correlation of widths within a beam size . from the clt we understand the effect of these three as follows :",
    "a broader distribution of all profile widths will increase the uncertainty on the mean ( @xmath13 ) , as seen in equation [ eqn : clt ] . from the same equation",
    ", it follows that a population of filaments with on average larger lengths will have a smaller @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we have seen that neglecting the effect of the beam ( random draws of the width from the parent distribution ) produces a narrow @xmath13 .",
    "the effect of the beam is to introduce a larger uncertainty on the mean , by effectively reducing the number of independent measurements in a single filament ."
