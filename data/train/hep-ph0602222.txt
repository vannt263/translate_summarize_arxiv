    "a typical electrodynamic plasma of interest in astrophysics @xcite , consists of electron , positron and photons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) at thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "since it is a plasma medium , individual particle properties are modified by collective effects of plasma .",
    "one way to take account of this effect , is to use quasi - particle model . just like in debye theory of specific heat or theory of liquid helium etc .",
    "thermal properties of the medium may be viewed as a result of thermal excitations or quasi - particles , like plasmons and dressed photons as a result of quantization of plasma waves and electromagnetic waves in plasma .",
    "the standard procedure is to obtain the classical dispersion relations for plasma or electromagnetic waves in plasma and on their quantization , we get quasi - particles , namely quasi - fermions corresponding to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and quasi - bosons like dressed photons .",
    "we study the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of such a system of quasi - particles .",
    "one such study was attempted by medvedev @xcite which we modify and correct it to get the present model and then generalize it to quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "qgp is a plasma made up of quarks and gluons @xcite , governed by strong interaction called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is similar to ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) system with electrons ( positrons ) are replaced by quarks ( antiquarks ) and photons by gluons .",
    "qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) is replaced by qcd .",
    "qgp also exhibits collective behaviour and hence the thermodynamic properties of qgp are modified and may be studied using quasi - particle model . of course",
    ", this kind of study was first attempted by peshier _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and latter it was modified with corrections and studied various groups @xcite . however , initially , these models were thermodynamically incosistent @xcite and also not self - consistent in calculating the thermodynamics ( td ) and quasi - particle properties .",
    "few attempts were done to correct these inconsistency @xcite by reformulating statistical mechanics ( sm ) . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have developed td consistent model of qgp without reformulating sm . here , in this new model , all previous problems of quasi - particle model , namely td inconsistency and self - consistency , are solved .",
    "both the systems we discussed are highly relativistic and hence we develop here quasi - particle model for such ultra - relativistic systems .",
    "we assume that the collective excitations of plasma leads to a system of non - interacting quasi - fermions and quasi - bosons , obeying fermi and bose statistics respectively . following the standard statistical mechanics @xcite , density of quasi - particles",
    "may be written as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fugacity , @xmath5 refers to bosons and fermions .",
    "@xmath6 is the degenarcy associated with the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "here @xmath7 is the energy of quasi - particle which may be obtained from classical approximate dispersion relation as , @xmath8 for bosons and @xmath8 for fermions .",
    "these forms of energy - momentum relations are widely used in quasi - particle models of qgp @xcite with @xmath9 replaced by temperature dependent masses , which they obtain from the finite temperature field theory calculations in ideal thermal bath .",
    "the general expressions for @xmath7 are very complicated even at high momentum limit and following medvedev @xcite , we approximate them to above simpler equations with an error of about @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the speed of light and @xmath12 is the planck constant .",
    "@xmath13 is the plasma frequency , given by , @xmath14 for ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) system .",
    "@xmath0 is the charge and @xmath15 the electron density which is also equal to positron density for a system with chemical potential equal to zero . in quasi - particle models , by definition , electron density is same as that of quasi - electrons .",
    "@xmath16 is the temperature of the system .",
    "let us first consider ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) system with chemical potential zero , or @xmath17 , and the density of quasi - electrons is , @xmath18 which may be rewritten as @xmath19 the density of positrons is same as that of electrons .",
    "similarly , the density of quasi - photons may be written as , @xmath20 where the fugacity is one for photons .",
    "these equations need to be solved self - consistently because @xmath15 which is to be determined is inside the integral through @xmath13 . redefining the variables ,",
    "the final equation to be solved self - consistently is , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 is the fine structure constant and @xmath25 is the modified bessel function .",
    "once we know @xmath15 or @xmath26 , we can obtain photon density from the relation , @xmath27 which follows from the eq .",
    "( [ eq : np ] ) .",
    "similarly , energy densities are given by , ",
    "@xmath28 or @xmath29 \\right)\\,\\,,\\ ] ] in terms of modified bessel functions @xmath25 , for electrons and @xmath30 or @xmath31 \\right)\\,\\,,\\ ] ] for photons .",
    "the blackbody planck s distribution may be easily read from above equations as @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "thus the planck s distribution is modified for the non - zero value of @xmath34 due to plasma with a cutoff frequency related to plasma frequency .    on taking a limit @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ne ] , [ eq : np ] ) , we get @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a riemann zeta function and has a value approximately @xmath39 and @xmath40 is related to @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "hence the @xmath15 and @xmath43 are related as @xmath44 as expected for ideal gas .",
    "note that in the earlier calculations , @xcite , the starting point of the formalism is @xmath45 , which is not right and such a relation is for energy densities .",
    "secondly , it is an ideal gas relation which need not be true for non - ideal system that we are discussing . here in our model",
    "we do nt use such relations between @xmath15 and @xmath43 , rather both of them are calculated self - consistently by solving the coupled integral equations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ne ] , [ eq : np ] ) ,    other thermodynamic functions , like pressure may be obtained from the thermodynamic relation @xmath46 which on integration gives @xmath47 , same as that of ideal relativistic gas .",
    "again this result also differs from ref .",
    "@xcite where their expression for pressure is not valid for massive particles .",
    "it is interesting to look at the expression for plasma frequency , @xmath48 where we took @xmath49 .",
    "it is very close to @xmath50 , obtained from the finite temperature field theory calculations , but note that it is not exactly equal because of our self - consistent calculations .",
    "from above discussion on ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) system .",
    "it is clear , in contrary to earlier work @xcite , one need to study qgp self - consistently in quasi - particle model .",
    "qgp is expected to form in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions and may exist in astropysical objects like neutron star , early universe etc . @xcite . the lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) simulation of qcd predicts such matter , but seems to be non - ideal plasma near to the transition temperature from hadrons to qgp . to explain this behaviour many phenomenological models , based on qcd and plasma ,",
    "have been proposed and quasi - particle model is one of them . as we discussed in the introduction ,",
    "many of quasi - particle models @xcite lack self - consistency in calculating the quasi - particle mass and the thermodynamic properties .",
    "let us consider , as an example , gluon plasma .",
    "the expression for gluon density , which is to be solved self - consistently , reduces to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is similar to @xmath53 discussed earlier .",
    "once we know @xmath52 , energy density may be evaluated from the relation , @xmath54 \\right)\\,\\,,\\ ] ] expressed in natural units and @xmath55 for gluons .",
    "note that , in qgp , gluons also carry charge and hence exhibits plasma oscillations even in the absence of quarks .",
    "therefore , in pure gluon plasma , plasma frequency depends on gluon density . in qgp",
    ", it depends both on quark density and gluon density .",
    "hence for gluon plasma we take @xmath56 with @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is the qcd running coupling constant .",
    "@xmath60 is a constant , equal to @xmath61 for ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) system , but here we determine it by demanding that @xmath62 as @xmath63 , a perturbative finite temperature field theory result .",
    "so we get @xmath64 . for constant @xmath34 or @xmath59 , @xmath65 and hence an ideal equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "however , lgt results show a modification of @xmath66 law near the transition temperature @xmath67 and they actually used temperature dependent 2-loop order @xmath68 .",
    "hence , we also consider similar expression to model @xmath68 , given by , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a parameter related to qcd scale parameter .",
    "@xmath71 , the number of flavors , is zero in pure gluon plasma to be compared with lgt results .",
    "@xmath70 is the only parameter of our model to be found by fitting with lgt result .",
    "once we know @xmath72 , it is stright forward to get pressure @xmath73 by integrating the thermodynamic relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : ep ] ) and then all other thermodynamic quantities may be obtained .",
    "for ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) system we recalculated various thermodynamical quantities , reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , using our model with proper corrections .",
    "the departure of these quantities from that of ideal system is too small to be noticed and tabulated in table 1 .",
    "planck s distribution in plasma is plotted in fig . 1 along with the planck s distribution in the absence of plasma .",
    "qualitatively similar results as in ref .",
    "@xcite with cutoff in the distribution etc .",
    "but , note that , the numerical values differ and our values listed in table 1 with plasma are smaller than without plasma . where as in ref . @xcite",
    "just the opposite , seems to be a numerical error .",
    "when we apply our self - consistent quasi - particle model to qgp , as an exmple gluon plasma , we can explain very nicely lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) @xcite results as shown in fig .",
    "2 , using a single parameter @xmath74 .",
    "the self - consistently calculated plasma frequency is @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 at @xmath78 , instead of @xmath79 used in all other quasi - particle models @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that it is close to the value we used in our earlier thermodynamically consistent quasi - particle model @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "we formulated a new self - consistent quasi - particle model to describe the thermodynamics ( td ) of relativistic plasma , like ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) and qgp .",
    "basic idea is that because of the collective behaviour of plasma , td of such a system may obtained by studying the td of quasi - particles which are thermally excited quanta of plasma and electromagnetic waves in plasma .",
    "this is equivalent to a system of bosons and fermions with mass propotional to plasma frequency .",
    "plasma frequency depends on the density , a td quantity , which we want to find out and hence a self - consistent problem to be solved .",
    "note that , in all earlier quasi - particle models of qgp @xcite , this self - consistency is not taken into account .",
    "in addition they have problems of td inconsistencies etc . and as a result of both problems , they need more than two parameters to fit the lgt results . further extension of this model to qgp with finite number of quark flavors , with and without chemical potential , may be future interesting problem .",
    "as long as ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) system , studied earlier by medvedev @xcite , is concerned , we modified his result with corrections in our new approach and obtained qualitatively the same results , but the numerical values and the sign of the modifications due to plasma are different .",
