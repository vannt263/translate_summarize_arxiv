    "in the standard model ( sm ) , flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions are suppressed by the gim mechanism  @xcite . due to the large mass of the top - quark , close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale ,",
    "deviations from the sm are expected to be observed first in the top sector .    at the hera @xmath5 collider , with its maximum centre - of - mass energy of @xmath6  gev , top quarks can only be singly produced . at tree level",
    ", the production proceeds through the charged current ( cc ) reaction @xmath7 . since the sm cross section for single - top production is less than 1  fb , any observed single - top event in the present data would be a clear sign of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the fcnc coupling , @xmath8 or @xmath9 , would induce the neutral current ( nc ) reaction @xmath0 @xcite , in which the incoming lepton exchanges a @xmath10 or @xmath11 with an up - type quark in the proton , yielding a top quark in the final state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - stop ] ) .",
    "the @xmath11 exchange is suppressed by the large propagator mass .",
    "furthermore , large values of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the struck quark , are needed to produce a top quark . since the @xmath14-quark density of the proton is much higher than the @xmath15-quark density , the production of single top quarks is most sensitive to a coupling of the type @xmath4 .",
    "the search for single - top quark production  @xcite reported in the following sections was based on the complete hera  i dataset of 130  pb@xmath2 .",
    "the sm decay , @xmath16 , with subsequent leptonic decay of the @xmath3 boson , @xmath17 ( 11% branching ratio per channel ) , leads to the presence of an isolated high - energy lepton , significant missing transverse momentum arising from the undetected neutrino and a large value of the hadronic transverse momentum , @xmath18 , stemming from the @xmath19-quark decay .",
    "production of single @xmath3 bosons with subsequent leptonic decay is the only sm process with a measurable cross section ( about 1 pb , evaluated including qcd corrections @xmath20",
    "@xcite ) , which leads , at hera , to events with an isolated lepton and missing transverse momentum in the final state .",
    "however a steeply falling @xmath18-spectrum is expected for events from single @xmath3 production .    in the hadronic decay channel of the @xmath3 boson , @xmath21 ( 68 % branching ratio ) ,",
    "three jets are expected in the final state , with the dijet invariant - mass distribution for the correct pair of jets peaking at the mass of the @xmath3 boson , @xmath22 , and the three - jet invariant - mass distribution peaking at the mass of the top quark , @xmath23 .",
    "qcd multijet events are the main sm background in the hadronic channel .",
    "anomalous fcnc couplings could lead to the decays @xmath24 and @xmath25 , resulting in multi - jet signatures with lepton pairs from the decay of the gauge boson .",
    "the main selection requirements for the search in the leptonic decay channels of the @xmath3 boson were large missing transverse momentum as measured with the calorimeter , @xmath26  gev , and the presence of an isolated track , which had to be identified as either electron or muon .",
    "the events had to contain at least one jet .",
    "events with an electron candidate in a back - to - back configuration with the hadronic system were rejected , thus reducing background from neutral current deep inelastic scattering ( nc dis ) events .",
    "the selected data sample contained 24 ( 12 ) electron ( muon ) candidate events , in good agreement with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) events expected from sm processes .",
    "the sm expectation in the electron channel is dominated by badly reconstructed nc dis events , while in the muon channel the main contribution is from bethe - heitler muon pair production , where only one of the two muons is detected and the missing transverse momentum is due to mismeasurement .    a subsequent final selection for single - top candidates",
    "was applied to the preselection of isolated lepton events .",
    "the cuts were optimised using simulations of both the sm background and the expected single - top signal . in the electron channel ,",
    "nc dis background was further reduced based on the energy - momentum balance . in the muon channel , a cut on the missing transverse momentum , after correcting for the muon - track momentum , was applied to reduce background from bethe - heitler muon pair production . in both channels ,",
    "a large value of the hadronic transverse momentum , @xmath29  gev , was required . after applying these additional cuts",
    ", no events remained in the data sample , while @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) electron ( muon ) events were expected from sm processes , mainly from single @xmath3 production .",

    "the event selection in the hadronic decay channel of the @xmath3 boson required three jets with @xmath32 gev , @xmath33 gev and @xmath34 gev .",

    "events from nc dis processes were suppressed by rejecting events with identified electron candidates .",
    "the normalisation uncertainties of the photoproduction background , which was only evaluated in leading order of qcd , were reduced by normalising the simulated event rates to those observed in the low - mass domain .",

    "the signal efficiency was 24% for the hadronic decays of the @xmath3 boson .",
