    "matter halos @xcite . for a cluster that virializes at the present time @xcite , @xmath8 where we adopt the standard set of cosmological parameters @xcite and assume primordial composition with 24% helium by mass .",
    "thus , the mean - free - path of protons and electrons is comparable to the size of the virialized envelope of hot x - ray clusters .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations @xcite show that a substantial portion of the surface of these envelopes is in contact with rarefied voids in which @xmath9 .",
    "protons moving away from the cluster envelope towards a neighboring void must be confined by gravity since coulomb collisions in the surrounding @xmath9 environment are too rare to confine them .",
    "this applies even better to protons with a kinetic energy @xmath10 larger than the mean thermal value , since the coulomb mean - free - path scales as @xmath11 .",
    "if the kinetic energy of a proton exceeds the local gravitational binding energy , gravity can not keep the proton bound to the cluster .",
    "thermal plasma would therefore evaporate from the cluster ( as each escaping proton must be accompanied by an electron so as to preserve charge quasi - neutrality ) .",
    "this process reflects a departure from the fluid description of the intracluster gas and can not be captured by numerical hydrodynamic simulations which are based on the fluid approximation .",
    "the purpose of the this paper is to gauge the significance of this evaporation process in x - ray clusters and to motivate future numerical simulations involving kinetic theory in cosmological three - dimensional geometries .",
    "significant evaporation would modify the baryon fraction in clusters and weaken the case for it having a universal value that can be used for cosmological distance determination @xcite .",
    "the evaporation would also heat the gas in voids @xcite and potentially change the ly@xmath12 absorption signature of voids in quasar spectra at low redshifts @xcite . the fractional helium abundance in clusters",

    "the use of x - ray clusters for cosmological parameter determination ( e.g. regarding the dark energy equation of state ) is one of the active frontiers in cosmology .",

    "the timescale for equilibration of the electron and proton temperatures through coulomb collisions is comparable to the hubble time @xcite .",
    "however , within any plasma confined by a gravitational field , there is an electric field which balances the pressure gradient of the electrons @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the electron pressure and @xmath20 is the electron charge .",

    "the gravitational potential barrier is reduced by a factor of 2 . if @xmath21 then @xmath22 and the barrier equals the full gravitational potential .",
    "the evaporation rate depends only on the mean thermal energy per electron - proton pair irrespective of how they share this energy . for simplicity",

    "the local barrier in the outer envelope of the cluster is smaller than its mass - averaged value across the entire cluster .",

    "next we calculate the fraction of protons above the escape speed as a function of fractional radius @xmath31 .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium for a primordial composition implies @xmath32 and the escape speed for a proton ( after subtracting off the repulsive electric force from the gravitational force ) is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gas mass density and @xmath35 is the total interior mass at radius @xmath36 .",

    "thermal evaporation will occur preferentially across the contact surface with voids where there is negligible resistance to the outward flux of escaping particles .",
    "magnetic fields which are tangled on small scales would suppress evaporation since the proton larmor radius is negligibly small .",

    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 is the interior gas mass at the virial radius and @xmath65 is the hubble time at the redshift of interest .",
    "hence , the fraction of the cluster gas that evaporates over a fraction @xmath12 of the hubble time is @xmath66 . for @xmath67 and @xmath68 ,",
    "the total evaporated fraction is @xmath69 , comparable to the fraction of baryons which are locked in stars @xcite .",
    "a deficit larger by a factor of a few ( attainable with @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) is still allowed by existing data on the baryon mass fraction in cluster envelopes @xcite . as accretion will taper off in the future of a @xmath72dominated universe @xcite ,",

    ", the magnetic tension @xmath74 needs to exceed the momentum flux of the suprathermal particles @xmath75 , or else the magnetic field will be moved around by the suprathermal wind .",
    "although the field is anchored to the bulk of the plasma , a large load of suprathermal particles will reshape its topology and allow escape , e.g. through the `` garden - hose '' instability @xcite and other buckling instabilities of the magnetic field @xcite that will open channels of outflow for the suprathermal particles .",
    "these instabilities are sourced by the anisotropic distribution of particles in the local plasma frame and are particularly powerful when the pressure anisotropy of the plasma exceeds the magnetic pressure .",

    "\\label{eq : mom}\\ ] ] synchrotron and hard x - ray observations as well as faraday rotation measurements in the _ periphery _ of the extended halos around clusters infer a magnetic field strength which is 310 times lower than the required magnitude @xcite .",
    "the associated magnetic tension is at least an order of magnitude smaller than required and could therefore allow significant leakage of suprathermal particles .",
    "the mean - free - path of suprathermal protons might be reduced through scattering on plasma waves @xcite , which are excited in the intracluster plasma by the collisionless shock formed when accreting gas impacts on the cluster boundary or through the turbulence generated by the motion of sub - halos within the cluster .",
    "however , the excitation of plasma turbulence is expected to be unsteady and the waves would leak out during quiescent episodes of weak accretion .",
    "the long mean - free - path of protons makes a large viscosity coefficient that would have suppressed acoustic turbulence altogether in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "( although existing hydrodynamic simulations identify acoustic turbulence in cluster cores , their limited numerical resolution and incomplete treatment of plasma physics do not allow them to examine reliably the turbulence damping rate @xcite . )",
    "plausible excitation mechanisms of alfven waves in a relaxed cluster produce negligible power on wavelengths that resonate with the microscopic ion gyro - radius , @xmath77 ; under such circumstances the waves can not scatter effectively the suprathermal particles and suppress their large momentum flux .",
    "the outgoing beam of suprathermal particles would generate a shock in surrounding voids through the plasma two - stream instability @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation of the instability at finite temperatures implies that a maxwellian - tail beam will not excite this instability within the hot cluster plasma but only as it enters the much colder environment of a void .",
    "the resulting shock will heat the gas in the voids and enrich it with magnetic fields .",
    "we have shown that if magnetic confinement is ineffective ( eq . [ eq : mom ] ) , then thermal evaporation is capable of removing up to a tenth of the cluster gas at its virial temperature over a hubble time ( eq . [ eq : mdot ] ) . local energy injection from cluster mergers @xcite , active galactic nuclei @xcite or supernovae @xcite",
    "could enhance the evaporated fraction as it would raise the gas temperature and lower the corresponding value of @xmath78 .",
    "the evaporated fraction is exponentially sensitive to enhancements in the gas temperature , with @xmath79 . for a fixed energy injection per baryon ( as expected from a constant star / black - hole formation efficiency )",
    ", the change in @xmath78 would be largest at low values of @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the baryon fraction in the shallower potential wells of poor clusters appears to be smaller than in rich clusters @xcite , indicating gas loss through additional heat supply to the virial energy budget .",
    "an essential ingredient for the evaporation to be maintained is that the tail of suprathermal protons will be replenished despite the low collisionality of the plasma in the cluster atmosphere .",
    "indeed protons just below the escape speed are turned around by gravity and then fall back towards the cluster center .",
    "along their trajectory they encounter higher density gas , where they collide with other protons and re - populate the maxwellian tail once again .",
    "an approach to the collisional regime merely requires sinking by a factor of 2 in radius for the nfw density profile , where @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "this replenishment process does not occur for weakly interacting dark matter particles , which would therefore not evaporate steadily in relaxed clusters .",
    "the dark matter might nevertheless experience transient evaporation episodes as a result of time - dependent gravitational interactions during violent mergers .",
    "although existing simulations of clusters are performed in the fluid approximation , they can nevertheless be implemented for calculating the thermal evaporation rate under more realistic conditions than those considered in fig .",
    "1 . the simulated distributions of the gravitational potential and the gas temperature can be used to derive @xmath82 and @xmath83 within the region where the plasma is collisionless . a corresponding evaporation term",
    "can then be added to the local conservation laws .",
    "the significance of magnetic confinement could be examined through magneto - hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , with the important inclusion of the stress tensor for suprathermal particles and cosmic - rays .",
    "better observational constraints on the intracluster magnetic field @xcite could determine whether the inferred magnetic tension in cluster halos is indeed unable to sustain the momentum flux of suprathermal protons above the escape speed ( eq . [ eq : mom ] ) .",
    "the same fields affect intracluster cosmic - rays which produce neutral pions that decay into @xmath84-rays @xcite .",
    "future @xmath84-ray observations with glast could constrain the magnetic confinement time of cosmic - rays , and by extrapolation  suprathermal particles .    existing x - ray data on the baryon mass fraction @xcite probe only the interior of clusters ( @xmath85 ) , where @xmath86 .",
    "the observed baryon fraction there is already known to be smaller than the expected cosmic average .",
    "future extensions of existing data sets to the low - density envelopes of hot clusters through deep observations of their x - ray emission or sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , could determine whether there is a deficit in the baryon fraction relative to the cosmic value beyond the level expected from the consumption of gas by star formation @xcite .",
