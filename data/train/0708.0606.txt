    "a number of model neural networks exhibit collective oscillation .",
    "their mechanisms of oscillation can be classified into three types : ( 1 ) individual neurons are oscillators with varied frequencies , and collective oscillation emerges through phase interaction between individual oscillators ; ( 2 ) neurons are simple relaxation elements , and oscillation emerges as a result of interaction between excitatory and inhibitory groups of neurons ; ( 3 ) neurons are instantaneous integrators of incoming signals , and oscillation emerges due to signal transmission delay between elements .",
    "the first two scenarios have been studied in detail for many decades , and are already established as fundamental nonlinear dynamical phenomena @xcite .",
    "light was shed on the third scenario rather recently and much is not known mathematically in spite of the ubiquity of signal transmission delays , not only in networks of biological neurons but also in networks of artificial electrocircuits @xcite .    in biological neural networks ,",
    "the transmission delay is a sum of axonal , synaptic and dendritic delays .",
    "it has been reported that the delay can be comparable to or longer than somatic membrane time scale @xcite .",
    "we consider here a model network in which the transmission delays are distributed in a large interval of time .",
    "we model the neuron for simplicity as a discrete - time threshold element that updates its state at each time step according to the summed input signals , each of which has arrived with a fixed transmission delay .    in the studies of neural networks , synchronous update from the preceding states of other elements",
    "has often been discussed @xcite .",
    "this synchronous update rule can give rise to a period - two macroscopic oscillation as the strength of the inhibitory connections is increased @xcite . in the present study , we consider the more general case in which inter - neuronal transmission delays are distributed widely in time .",
    "we derive a recurrence equation of the macroscopic order parameter representing the mean activity from the dynamics of the individual threshold elements .",
    "the network is found to exhibit a collective oscillation with period close to the mean transmission delay .",
    "the collective dynamics can not only be a simple alternation of the consecutive firing and consecutive resting , but also a nontrivially sequenced series of firing and resting , repeating in a given period of time .",
    "for the system whose inter - neuronal transmission delays are distributed uniformly in a given range of time , we obtain multiple stable periodic orbits . due to the multi - stability , one can store a nontrivial firing sequence in the network . for the case of",
    "non - uniformly distributed delays , we solve the recurrence equation and find that the network can exhibit not only periodic but also quasiperiodic or chaotic dynamics .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section ii a recurrence equation of the mean activity is derived . in section",
    "iii the stationary solution for the macroscopic dynamical equation and its linear stability is examined analytically . in section",
    "iv the macroscopic state equation is solved numerically for a variety of distributions of the delays . in section v the numerical simulation of the original microscopic equations is carried out and compared with the solution of the macroscopic state equation . in section",
    "vi we discuss the significance of delayed networks .",
    "in this section , we derive the dynamical equation of the macroscopic activity from the microscopic dynamics of the individual elements , each of which is a simple threshold neuron that evokes an all - or - nothing response to an input @xmath0 at discrete times @xmath1 as , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the sign function that takes values @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 respectively for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . here , @xmath0 is a `` total input '' representing a linear sum of incoming signals from other neurons , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the `` synaptic weight '' that represents excitatory ( positive ) or inhibitory ( negative ) connection from the @xmath12th neuron to the @xmath13th neuron .",
    "@xmath14 is the signal transmission delay specified for each transmission line ( fig.[fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "@xmath15 will be called the `` external stimulus '' in this paper . in an asymmetrical representation",
    "in which neuronal firing and resting are represented as @xmath16 or @xmath5 , the external stimulus should be read as @xmath17 .    a macroscopic order parameter representing the mean activity is defined as the average neuronal state at each time @xmath18 : @xmath19 in the following , we derive a dynamical equation of the macroscopic state , in parallel with amari s derivation for the synchronous update rule @xcite , which corresponds to a particular case of the unit - time delay in the present model , @xmath20 .",
    "the macroscopic state defined above is identical to the difference of ratios of positive and negative total inputs @xmath21 to individual neurons ( @xmath22 ) . using the distribution @xmath23 of total inputs @xmath24 at time @xmath18",
    ", the macroscopic state can be represented as @xmath25    the central limit theorem holds for the summed inputs , @xmath26 , in the limit of a large number of neurons , if the individual signals @xmath27 are independently sampled from a given distribution of a finite variance . in the present deterministic model , the statistical independence holds if individual neuronal states @xmath28 are chosen independently from synaptic connections @xmath29 .",
    "as the microscopic states are updated through synaptic connections , however , @xmath28 are not independent from @xmath29 any more as time goes by .",
    "even with this condition , there would be room for statistical independence , if the connection weights @xmath30 themselves are chosen independently of each other .",
    "the question of statistical independence was initially raised by rozonor @xcite .",
    "it was proven by amari that the statistical independence holds under some special conditions @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we further introduce the distribution of transmission delays @xmath31 .",
    "this raises another problem of the correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath31 . in this paper , we do not go into this open problem , but rather , use the assumption of their statistical independence to construct a macroscopic state equation for our proposed delayed networks .",
    "we will examine the validity of the assumption by comparing the solutions of the macroscopic state equation with the simulation of microscopic equations .",
    "in addition , if the `` external stimuli '' @xmath32 are normally distributed , then the distribution @xmath23 of total inputs @xmath24 is gaussian , characterized solely by the mean @xmath33 and variance @xmath34 at each time @xmath18 as @xmath35 by inserting this into eq.([eq : pv ] ) , the macroscopic state equation is obtained as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the error function : @xmath38    under the above - mentioned assumption of statistical independence , the mean @xmath33 and variance @xmath34 of input signals @xmath24 are obtained as @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the means and variances of @xmath29 and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 denotes the mean past activity : @xmath46    we consider the case that delays @xmath31 are randomly distributed from @xmath47 to @xmath48 over transmission lines with the ratios @xmath49 , ( @xmath50 ) . assuming the statistical independence between individual states @xmath51 and delays @xmath31 , the mean past activity is given by the weighted average of the past macroscopic states : @xmath52    the evolution equation of the macroscopic state is given by inserting the mean @xmath33 and variance @xmath34 into eq.([eq : macro1 ] ) .",
    "if the model parameters satisfy @xmath53 , the evolution equation simplifies to @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are dimensionless parameters respectively representing the average synaptic weight and the external stimulus , @xmath57 we will analyze the recurrence equation ( [ eq : macro ] ) in the following sections . it should be noted that @xmath53 is not an essential condition for a macroscopic equation ( [ eq : macro1 ] ) to hold but is merely introduced to make the analysis simpler .",
    "given a macroscopic stationary state @xmath58 that satisfies @xmath59 we wish to analyze its stability .",
    "for this purpose , the recurrence equation ( [ eq : macro ] ) is linearized with respect to the deviation from the stationary state , @xmath60 , as @xmath61 where @xmath62 the stationary state is locally stable if all roots of the characteristic equation , @xmath63 are smaller than 1 in magnitude .",
    "we start with the synchronous update rule originally studied by amari  @xcite , which corresponds to the case of unit time delay @xmath20 in the present framework . the linearized equation for this case",
    "is simply given by @xmath64 .",
    "the stationary solution is stable if @xmath65 , marginal if @xmath66 and unstable if @xmath67 .",
    "the phase space of parameters @xmath55-@xmath56 is divided into three regions according to qualitative differences in the macroscopic state stability ( fig.[fig : phase - nodelay ] ) ; [ monostable region ] : the system has only one stable stationary state ( @xmath65 ) ; [ bistable region ] : the system has one unstable stationary state with @xmath68 and two stable stationary states ( @xmath65 ) ; [ oscillatory region ] : the system has one unstable stationary state with @xmath69 , and one stable oscillatory orbit of period two .",
    "next , we consider the case that delays are uniformly distributed in a given interval of time , @xmath70  for @xmath71 .",
    "the characteristic equation for this case is @xmath72 in the following , we prove that for this particular case the stationary solution is locally stable if @xmath73 , and unstable otherwise .",
    "for @xmath74 , all roots of the characteristic polynomial equation ( [ eq : character2 ] ) align on a unit circle in a complex plane ; @xmath75 . as @xmath76 passes @xmath77 from above ,",
    "all the roots simultaneously leave the unit circle ( fig.[fig : roots](a ) ) . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the characteristic equation has one root @xmath79 , which has the largest length .",
    "as @xmath76 passes @xmath80 from below , this root exceeds @xmath80 along the real axis ( fig.[fig : roots](b ) ) . in appendix a , we prove that the characteristic equation ( [ eq : character2 ] ) possesses no other roots of unit length .",
    "this means that the linearized equation can be destabilized only at these two critical points @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    as in the case of the synchronous update rule or unit - time delay @xmath83 ,",
    "the phase space can be divided into three characteristic regions according to qualitative differences in the linear stability .",
    "the distributed transmission delay does nt shift the boundary between monostable and bistable regions .",
    "the boundary between monostable and oscillatory regions is shifted to the lower direction in @xmath55 as @xmath48 is increased ( fig [ fig : phase - delay ] ) .",
    "note that the present categorization is solely based on the ( local ) linear stability and there is room for other dynamical orbits to coexist globally .",
    "the coexistence of multiple orbits will be discussed in the next section .",
    "finally , we consider the general case that delays are distributed non - uniformly in a given interval of time @xmath48 , satisfying @xmath50 . even in this general case ,",
    "the boundary between monostable and bistable regions is the same as the case of uniformly - distributed delays as well as the unit - time delay , as proven below : at @xmath84 , all roots of the characteristic equation ( [ eq : character ] ) degenerate at @xmath85 . while for @xmath86 , the characteristic equation does not have roots of @xmath87 , implying that all roots are inside the unit circle in the complex plane . at @xmath78 ,",
    "one root arrives at @xmath79 , above which a stationary solution becomes unstable .",
    "the critical value of @xmath76 on the negative side of @xmath55 depends on the distribution of the delays @xmath88 . as depicted by fig.[fig : delay - roots](a ) , all roots do not necessarily leave the unit circle simultaneously , unlike the uniformly distributed case .",
    "in this section , we solve the recurrence equation ( [ eq : macro ] ) to observe the dynamics of the macroscopic order parameter @xmath89 .",
    "the dynamical state obtained for the synchronous update model or the unit - time delay is a simple period - two oscillation .",
    "special attention is paid here to nontrivial temporal activity patterns of the network with distributed delays .",
    "first , we numerically solve the macroscopic state equation of the network with uniformly distributed delays , @xmath70 for @xmath90 : @xmath91    oscillation occurs in the parameter region where inhibition dominates as we see in figs.[fig : phase - nodelay ] and [ fig : phase - delay ] .",
    "figure [ fig : bifur - diagram ] displays the bifurcation diagram of the macroscopic recurrence equation ( [ eq : macro - uniform ] ) in the case of @xmath92 . for a given mean connection that is negative , ( a ) @xmath93 or ( b ) @xmath94 , we vary the external stimulus @xmath56 and observe the temporal activity pattern generated by the recurrence equation : for each set of parameters of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we choose 100 random initial conditions , and iterate the recurrence equation for @xmath95 and plot the last several values of @xmath89 .",
    "if the external stimulus @xmath56 is sufficiently small , the system exhibits a stationary sequence of negative @xmath96 close to @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath56 is increased , a positive @xmath96 close to @xmath4 appears among @xmath96s close to @xmath6 , once every @xmath97 iterations .",
    "note that the oscillation is observed already in the parameter region in which the stationary state is linearly stable .",
    "in other words , oscillatory orbits and a stationary state coexist in the same system , as mentioned in section iii . as @xmath56",
    "is increased further , a positive @xmath96 appears twice every @xmath97 iterations .",
    "the temporal order of positive and negative @xmath96s can be chosen arbitrarily , but it is fixed once the iteration starts .",
    "the proportion of positive @xmath96s increases with @xmath56 , and eventually the system exhibits a stationary sequence of positive @xmath96 .",
    "note that different proportions of positive and negative @xmath96s may coexist for the same value of @xmath56 .",
    "we solved the recurrence equation from initial conditions with @xmath96s uniformly distributed . within our range of numerical investigation",
    ", we obtained all possible arrangements of positive and negative @xmath96s of cycle length @xmath97 . in the case of @xmath92 , the period of oscillation",
    "is always @xmath98 , the prime number . in the general case of @xmath97 that is not a prime number , the period could be shorter with the repetition of short sequenced activity .",
    "figure [ fig : bifur - diagram](b ) shows the solutions for @xmath94 .",
    "it is notable that there appears a new intermediate state of @xmath96 close to @xmath5 in addition to states of @xmath96 close to @xmath4 and @xmath6 . in comparison with the case",
    "@xmath93 , the region in which different proportions of positive and negative @xmath96s coexist becomes relatively narrower . in the limit @xmath99 , the proportion of positive and negative @xmath96s",
    "are uniquely determined by the parameter @xmath100 , as is proven in appendix b.      next , we examine the case that the delays @xmath101 are unevenly distributed : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath104 .",
    "in addition to periodic oscillation , the system may exhibit quasi - periodic dynamics ( figs.[fig : bifur - chaos](a ) and ( b ) ) . as the deviation @xmath105",
    "is increased further , the system may exhibit chaos ( figs.[fig : bifur - chaos](c ) and ( d ) ) characterized by the positive value of the lyapunov exponent : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is an @xmath48-dimensional perturbation vector added to an original orbit .",
    "in this section , we carry out a numerical simulation of the original microscopic equations ( [ eq : micro ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of macroscopic order parameter representing the mean activity of microscopic elements are compared with solutions of the macroscopic state equation ( [ eq : macro ] ) .",

    "simulation , external stimuli @xmath110 are taken as @xmath5 .",
    "the transmission delays @xmath31 are chosen randomly from @xmath111 .",
    "this corresponds to the case of uniformly distributed delays , @xmath112    the resulting macroscopic order parameter @xmath89 is depicted in fig.[fig : micro ] : ( a ) and ( b ) display the mean activity in the case of @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "the macroscopic state equation ( [ eq : macro ] ) with the parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 estimated with eqs.([eq : paraw ] ) and ( [ eq : paras ] ) exhibits temporal mean activity patterns similar to the simulation results ( figs.[fig : micro](d ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the temporal activity pattern is gradually modified as time goes by ( from ( a ) to ( b ) ) .",
    "this would be due to the finite size effect .",
    "the oscillation is stabilized in the parameter region of smaller @xmath40 , even in a system of the same size .",
    "the simulation result with the parameter @xmath119 and a solution of the macroscopic equation with the corresponding parameter @xmath120 are displayed in figs.[fig : micro](c ) and ( f ) .    as is predicted in the preceding section ,",
    "the macroscopic order parameter exhibits a wide variety of temporal dynamics depending on the initial condition .",

    "transmission delays provide networks with potential applications . in order to control them ,",
    "it is necessary to comprehend full aspects of their dynamical characteristics .",
    "we prove that the characteristic polynomial equation ( [ eq : character2 ] ) @xmath121 has no roots of unit length , other than the roots @xmath75 at @xmath74 and @xmath79 at @xmath78 .",
    "it is readily seen that @xmath79 can be a solution of the characteristic equation , if @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath122 , the characteristic equation can be transformed into @xmath123 this equation means that @xmath80 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are aligned on a line in the complex plane .",

    "we obtain exact solutions of this recurrence equation . for simplicity s sake ,",
    "we consider here the case of noninteger @xmath130 , with which @xmath89 takes the value of either @xmath4 or @xmath6 .",
    "the recurrence equation generates a stationary sequence of @xmath4 if @xmath131 , and a sequence of @xmath6 if @xmath132 . a sequence composed of both @xmath4 and @xmath6",
