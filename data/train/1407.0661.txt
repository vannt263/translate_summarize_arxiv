    "[ r - space - pure](a ) are located at @xmath22 1.8 and 2.1  if plotted separately - a shift of roughly -0.45  . for these peaks ,",
    "the @xmath81-space phase ( real part of the transform ) of the peak for the shortest pr - o2 distance ( 2 neighbours ) is nearly out of phase with that for the longer distance pr - o1 peak ( 6 neighbours ) , leading to a dip in the spectra at 1.8  .",

    "this modeling shows the environment about pr is relatively well ordered ( some disorder for pr - o2 and pr - pr is discussed later ) whereas that about bi is highly disordered  the bi - o1 peak which should occur near 2.1  in figure  [ r - space - pure](b ) , is strongly suppressed .",

    "the ru - o1 peak near 1.6  is also well ordered , surprisingly , even for the bi sample which has significant disorder of the bi - o peak .",
    "consequently since the ru - o1 peak has little disorder while the bi - o1 peak is disordered , bi must be displaced from the usual a - site position , in a direction perpendicular to the bi - o2 axis .",
    "this leads to a small distortion of the bi - o2 peak .",

    "this indicates that bi is also displaced perpendicular to the bi - o2 axis in the mixed compound and by a comparable amount .",
    "we find similar results at higher temperatures , the ru - o and most pr - o peaks are generally well ordered while the bi - o peak is strongly suppressed , indicating significant disorder .",
    "we also find that the pr - ru , ru - pr and ru - ru second neighbor peaks are reasonably ordered , but when bi is present , peaks that include bi second neighbors ( e.g. pr - bi or ru - bi ) also have disorder .      to determine the crystal field level scheme and the relevant low energy spin degrees of freedom we carried out high energy inelastic neutron scattering measurements on het .",
    "three methods were used to determine and then subtract the nonmagnetic phonon contribution to the data .",

    "the nonmagnetic contribution at low angles ( @xmath84 19@xmath18 ) is estimated from the measured scattering at high scattering angles ( @xmath84 135@xmath18 ) by using an energy dependent scaling factor determined from direct measurements on the pauli paramagnetic compound @xmath12 .",
    "this procedure is based on two assumptions .",
    "first , the magnetic scattering intensity , which is proportional to the square of the pr@xmath5 magnetic form factor , is negligible in the high angle scattering data .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary our analysis has shown that describing the ordering of the ru moments in @xmath11 either by the model proposed for y@xmath2ru@xmath2o@xmath3 or by the ir @xmath106 of space group @xmath98 gives identical fits to the data ( figs .",
    "[ d_y2ru27_fit ] and  [ irrep_fits ] ) . closer examination of both models reveals that the two associated bvs of @xmath106 are special cases of the more general description used for y@xmath2ru@xmath2o@xmath3 and these models are therefore identical ( fig .",

    "@xcite unlike what is found for the other magnetic rare earth containing ru - pyrochlores this suggests that the the ordering of the ru moments in @xmath4 is not influenced by the pr rare earth anisotropy .",
    "@xcite this in turn implies that the pr ground - state is non - magnetic and can explain why no ordering associated with the pr sublattice is observed down to 100 mk .",
    "interestingly the ordering observed for @xmath4 ( and y@xmath2ru@xmath2o@xmath3 ) is the same as found for er@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , there the rare earth anisotropy selects co - planar ordering ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "@xcite , width=302 ]      figure  [ tdep_om ] shows the temperature dependence of the ordered ru moment , which was obtained by fitting the neutron power diffraction data using @xmath108 to describe the ru ordering .",
    "this clearly shows the onset of an ordered ru moment below 170 k confirming that the anomaly observed in both the specific heat and magnetization measurements at 165 k is associated with the ordering of the ru - sublattice .",
    "@xcite as the temperature is further decreased the size of the ordered moment increases , to level off below 100 k to a value of  1.5 @xmath109 .",
    "this is in line with what is observed in the other ru - pyrochlores .",

    "[ iris_cont ] , one observes the following . in both samples the wave vector dependence of the dispersion indicates that it is associated with pr@xmath5 single ion physics and must arise from splitting of the doublet ground state .",
    "however , while for @xmath11 the peak in the dispersion is rather sharp ( but not resolution limited ) and temperature dependent , for @xmath16 it is broad and temperature independent . the presence of lone pairs on the bi in @xmath16 ( non - magnetic and close to the insulator to metal transition ) result in a low density of extended defects or a density wave which generates a continuum of local pr environments that is temperature independent .",
    "the exafs results show that the environment about bi is highly disordered for both the @xmath7 and @xmath12 samples .",
    "this disorder on those a sites occupied by bi will modify the cf experienced by neighboring pr ions .",
    "since pr is a non - kramers ion ( and the determined doublet ground state relies on @xmath66 point group symmetry ) this distribution of local distortions will lead to a broadened or split ground state . in the pure material this scenario with bi is not possible , but the exafs data indicate a small , but significant , disorder of the pr atoms along the pr - o2 axis which may also spit the ground state .",
    "another possible scenario that might explain the splitting of the pr doublet ground state in the @xmath4 material is that it results from the ru - sublattice ordering .",
    "it has already been observed for y@xmath2ru@xmath2o@xmath3 that magnetoelastic effects play an important role in allowing the ordering of the ru - sublattice to occur .",
    "@xcite while no optical data is available for @xmath11 the ordering observed is identical to that of y@xmath2ru@xmath2o@xmath3 , as such it is very likely that the observed spin - phonon interactions that allow for the ordering in y@xmath2ru@xmath2o@xmath3 are also present in @xmath11 .",
    "this combined with the lowering of the symmetry due to the ru ordering can result in a distribution of internal fields ( exchange and/or strain ) which in turn leads to the observed splitting of the doubled ground state .",
    "we have performed exafs , elastic and both high and low energy inelastic neutron scattering measurements on pr@xmath0bi@xmath1ru@xmath2o@xmath3 to understand the magnetic properties of this materials and complete those already reported by us .",
    "@xcite the exafs measurements reveal that the ru environment ( b - site ) remains well ordered throughout the series . in the case of the a - site",
    ", the pr environment has some small , but significant , intrinsic disorder along the pr - o2 axis which likely contributes to the splitting of the kramers doublet .",
    "in contrast , the environment about bi is highly disordered , and is attributed to the @xmath110 lone pairs on bi@xmath5 , which result in an off - center displacement . in agreement with previously reported diffraction studies",
    "the bi appears to move midway between two o1 atoms .",
    "our cf measurements reveal that the pr ions have a doublet ground state and singlet first excited state ( @xmath111 and latexmath:[$\\psi_1= |3 > +    for pr@xmath2ir@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the high energy inelastic neutron scattering data also suggest that strong cf - phonon coupling is present in both systems .",
    "fits to the diffraction data of the @xmath4 end member reveal no evidence ( within our experimental resolution ) of a structural distortion associated with the ordering of the ru moments below t@xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic ordering of the ru sublattice is similar to that of y@xmath2ru@xmath2o@xmath3 ( or by ir @xmath106 of space group @xmath113 ) .",
    "@xcite the ordering of the ru moments is not influenced by the pr rare earth anisotropy and no ordering of the pr sublattice was observed down to 1.5 k. the low energy magnetic response of pr@xmath0bi@xmath1ru@xmath2o@xmath3 shows the presence of of a ( broad ) dispersion associated with the splitting of the pr doublet ground state .",
    "for @xmath4 it is found to be temperature dependent , while for @xmath7 it is not .",
    "the nature of the splitting of the ( non - kramers ) doublet ground state changes upon doping , going from being intrinsic and/or magnetoelastically induced in @xmath4 to result from bi induced a - site disorder in @xmath7 .",
    "these measurements show that the pr ground - state can be very sensitive to local perturbations ( be they ex- or intrinsic ) , something that needs to be taken into account when studying materials containing this and other non - kramers rare earth ions , e.g. tb@xmath114ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , hg@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 or liho@xmath1y@xmath115f@xmath116 .  @xcite    the work at jhu and isis was supported by the us department of energy , office of basic energy sciences , division of material sciences and engineering under de - fg02- 02er45983 through 2008 and beyond that on de - fg02 - 08er46544 .",
