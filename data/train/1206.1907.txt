    "we hypothesize that filamentary molecular structures already exist in a much early evolutionary stage ( i.e. the time before the formation of the centralized massive cores and the satellite cores ) , and contribute to the accretion of molecular gas into the central hub ( see below ) .",
    "the matter concentration in the initial hub  filament configuration leads to a shorter local free  fall timescale than the timescale of the global contraction , which allows the simultaneous formation of the satellite cores and the centralized massive cores .",
    "while dense molecular cores evolve in a much quicker dynamical timescale and form ( proto)stellar objects ( see also the discussion in section [ sub_diversity ] ) , the geometry of extended molecular filaments remains similar to their initial geometrical configuration .",
    "given / assuming the comparable ages , the fact that the molecular mass of each of the central massive cores is several times higher than the molecular mass of the satellite cores ( table [ table_cores ] ) requires the centralized molecular cores to accrete more efficiently .",
    "this requirement can be realized because of two unique properties of the central region : ( 1 ) the deeper gravitational potential well in the center yields higher infall velocities , and ( 2 ) with the hfs configuration , molecular gas is channelled to the central region more efficiently through the detected molecular filaments .",
    "the fossil record of this continuous accretion onto the central molecular clump would be the detection of broad line emission from typical shock tracers such as sio , ocs or ch@xmath5cn ( bachiller & perez gutierrez 1997 ; jimenez - serra et al . 2005 ; 2010 ; csengeri et al . 2011a ) . even with comparable accretion velocities , the more adequate molecular gas reservoir for the central region will allow higher accretion rate than the satellite cores that are embedded in isolated , single molecular filaments .",
    "the molecular filaments may persist until later evolutionary stages . as an example , toward g10.6 - 0.4 a centralized 175 @xmath4 ob cluster ( sollins & ho 2005 ) , few expanding uc hii regions ( liu , zhang & ho .",

    "however , its central @xmath12 pc scale massive molecular clump still keeps the geometrical configuration that looks similar to the hub  filament configuration in g33.92 + 0.11 ( liu et al .",

    "the possibilities of redistributing angular momentum via fragmentation , or propagating out the angular momentum via molecular arms , are now being explored with our higher angular observations .",
    "if the comparably massive core a1 and a2 are orbiting with respect to each other , the gas accreting into the individual cores a1 and a2 only needs to lose excess specific angular momentum relative to that in the orbits of a1 and a2 .",

    "our sma data show that the large - scale filaments / arms present emission from sulfur - bearing species such as @xmath18cs and so .",
    "in particular , from figures 4 and 6 there seems to be a systematic spatial shift between the 8@xmath61@xmath34 m emission ( associated with pah emission and found closer in to the central ob star cluster ) and the @xmath18cs , @xmath18co and so lines .",

    "therefore , it is possible that the strong uv field arising from the central cluster of ob stars is escaping the dense gas of the central molecular clump , and illuminates the closer walls of the molecular filaments / arms leading to the formation of a typical pdr .",
    "indeed , the hii region detected toward g33.92 + 0.11 shows a cometary morphology , with the less - density gas ( and therefore easier to escape from ) toward the east ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "the scenario where g33.92 + 0.11 shows multiple chemical regimes , will be tested in the near future with a deep and broad bandwidth molecular line survey toward the hot cores in g33.92 + 0.11 a , toward the shocked regions at the confluence of the molecular arms with the central clump , and toward the pdr found in arm - e .",
