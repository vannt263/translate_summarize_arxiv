    "recent surveys focusing on repeated observations of large expanses of the night sky ( e.g. rotse , akerlof et al .",
    "2000 ) are transforming the study of variability phenomena one of the forefront research areas in modern day astrophysics .",
    "these searches have also demonstrated the unique value of small telescopes for this kind of research ; in particular , the wide field schmidt design , when equipped with mosaic ccd detectors , is a potentially ideal combination to collect multi - epoch data over extended areas of the sky in an efficient way . in this contribution",
    "i describe one of the variability surveys , spanning many hundreds of square degrees near the celestial equator , that are being carried at the venezuela national astronomical observatory using an 8k x 8k ccd mosaic camera , optimized for drift - scanning , installed on a 1 m schmidt telescope .",
    "the study of how stars and planetary systems form and evolve is an area in which variability surveys are particularly useful as a means to search for pre - main sequence objects .",
    "young ( 1 - 10 myr ) low mass ( @xmath1 ) stars are intrinsically variable at both optical ( herbst 1986 ) and near ir wavelengths ( carpenter , hillenbrand & strutskie 2001 ) by up to several magnitudes , thus , variability should help to single out these objects among the general field population .",
    "however , so far variability has been used mainly in follow - up studies rather than as a survey technique , to collect time - series data of young objects that were detected by some other method , like color - magnitude diagrams , x - ray and h@xmath2 surveys .",

    "vivas ( cida ) and lee hartmann ( cfa ) , we have used the 8k @xmath3 8k ccd mosaic camera on the venezuela 1 m schmidt telescope ( see baltay et al .",

    "though orion has been extensively studied in the past , existing optical / ir studies in orion have concentrated mostly on small regions such as the orion nebula cluster ( onc ; e.g. , hillenbrand 1997 ) and the surroundings of the star @xmath5 ori ( walter et al . 1998 ) . a few large scale studies ( wiramihardja et al .",

    "-0.8 in    we have developed tools for identifying variable stars using differential photometry . with a @xmath7 test and assuming a gaussian distribution for the errors , we consider variable only those objects for which the probability that the observed distribution is a result of the random errors is @xmath8% .",
    "the value of variability for picking out young stars is shown in fig.2 .",
    "follow up spectra of a large number of candidate young stars indicate that our selection technique is very efficient : roughly 50 - 60% of our candidates turn out to be young , low mass stars .",

    "presently we are scanning a new strip centered at @xmath10 , which we plan to observe repeatedly during the next 2 yrs .",
    "the actual temporal sampling is dictated by the number of nights available for our project , usually 8 - 10 nights / month , and the weather ( fig .",
