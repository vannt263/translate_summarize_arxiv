    "each new observational result concerning the nucleus of m  31 seems to deepen the mystery of its structure .",
    "this is mainly due to the improvement in the achieved spatial resolution of the photometric and spectroscopic data : the better resolved the object is , the more complex it appears .",
    "for any proposed physical mechanism which can quantitatively reproduce the observables , it is important to provide some specific predictions .    in this respect ,",
    "the nucleus of m  31 is certainly an excellent laboratory to test our knowledge of galactic nuclei , as we can now optically resolve scales as small as 0.3 pc ( e.g. hst or optically adaptive ground - based systems ) .",
    "indeed , the numerous studies achieved on this object revealed a puzzling complexity .",
    "m  31 s nucleus is a compact stellar system with an average ellipticity of @xmath5 .",
    "asymmetries in its major - axis surface brightness profile ( in the visible ) were already observed in 1974 by light et al . , and subsequently understood using the pre costar hst data as a double component nucleus ( lauer et al .",
    "1993 ) . in the v band , the fainter peak ( p2 ) is almost coincident with the centre of the bulge isophotes , as the brightest one ( p1 ) is located at about @xmath6 ( @xmath7 pc for a distance to m  31 of 0.77 mpc ) from p2 roughly along the major - axis . at 175 nm however , p2 is the brightest point , with p1 having an uv upturn similar to its surroundings ( king et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in 1960 , lallemand et al .",
    "obtained spectrograms of the central region of m  31 and detected the rapid rotation of its nucleus , concluding that it is a dynamically independent structure .",
    "this was confirmed by kormendy ( 1988 ) and dressler & richstone ( 1988 ) by long - slit spectroscopy with ccd detectors .",
    "both studies suggest the presence of a central dark mass of the order of @xmath2 m@xmath8 in the centre of the nucleus which would account for the high value of the central velocity and velocity dispersion gradients .",
    "sub - arcsecond velocity and dispersion maps were obtained with the tiger spectrograph by bacon et al .",
    "( 1994 , hereafter bemn94 ) which uncovered more asymmetries ( already traced in previous published data ) : the velocity field is nearly symmetric about a point @xmath9 located very close to p2 ( @xmath10 according to lauer et al .",
    "1993 ) , but the maximum @xmath11 of the stellar velocity dispersion roughly corresponds to the symmetric point of p1 with respect to p2 ( see fig .",
    "26 of bemn94 ) .",
    "different interpretations have been proposed to explain the observed photometric and dynamical asymmetries in the nucleus of m  31 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : meca ] and references therein ) , but they each encounter severe problems . some questions remain open , such as the actual efficiency of dynamical friction for an external body falling into the nucleus , the life - time of @xmath0 perturbations , or the amount of dynamical perturbation on the nucleus itself ; we try here to answer these questions through n body simulations . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on one of the proposed mechanism , namely that p1 corresponds to a stellar cluster falling into the potential well of the nucleus , hosting a massive black hole . in a companion paper",
    ", we will examine whether a central black hole is unavoidable , or the presence of a nuclear bar could account for the observational data .",
    "we summarize and comment the alternatives already discussed by different authors in sect .  2 .",
    "in sect .  3 we describe the n body code we used as well as the initial conditions of the different experiments .",
    "the results are discussed in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .  5 , we present and discuss our attempts to fit the observables using different assumptions .",
    "the general discussion and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "the m31 nucleus is an object of peculiar attention , because of its large central velocity gradient and velocity dispersion : it is one of the best candidate among nearby galaxies to host a massive black hole ( bh of the order of 10@xmath12 - 10@xmath13 m@xmath14 , e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "possible scenarii include one massive bh , two bhs , or no bh at all .",
    "we will consider here only the first class of models , with several possibilities to account for the observed asymmetries .",
    "previous studies already discarded a gravitational lens or a dust component to be responsible for these asymmetries ( e.g. bemn94 ) , so we will discuss the two remaining ones : a dense stellar cluster falling into the nucleus ( already suggested by dressler & richstone 1988 , see also lauer et al .",
    "1993 , bemn94 ) or a thick eccentric disc of stars on keplerian orbits around the black hole , maintained through self - gravity and dynamical friction on the bulge ( tremaine 1995 ) .",
    "tremaine ( 1995 ) recently proposed a model based on a set of aligned keplerian orbits , forming an @xmath0 pattern .",
    "the main argument for an orbit crowding effect is the lack of any significant colour gradient between p1 and the rest of the nucleus , except for p2 which has a higher uv upturn which could correspond to the radio source detected by crane et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and linked with the presumed central dark mass . but as argued by king et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , this difference in the uv flux is equivalent to a single pagb star , although it seems more extended ( p. crane , priv .",
    "tremaine ( 1995 ) also argued that the observed isophote twist of p1 as well as the elongations of p1 and p2 along the p1-p2 axis are natural consequences of the eccentric disc hypothesis .",
    "the only problem in tremaine s model lies in the strong predicted asymmetry of the observed velocity field , in contradiction with the recently acquired data of kormendy ( sis / cfht , @xmath15 )",
    ".    in his proposition , tremaine ( 1995 ) suggests that the alignment of apsides of the orbits forming the eccentric disc is maintained by the self - gravity of the nuclear disc .",
    "in fact , an @xmath0 mode could amplify in the disc , if it has a positive pattern speed @xmath16 , and if dynamical friction against the non - rotating bulge removes effectively the angular momentum , provoquing more eccentricity in the disc orbits .",
    "the efficiency of this mechanism is still unknown .",
    "another possibility is that the @xmath0 perturbation is transient , but slowly damped .",
    "weinberg ( 1994 ) shows that a stellar system can sustain weakly damped @xmath0 mode for hundreds of crossing times .",
    "a fly - by encounter could excite such a mode , and explain off - centring in some spiral galaxies .",
    "we have tried to estimate the relevant time - scale for the fading of an @xmath0 excitation in the particular conditions of the m31 nucleus , in the presence of a massive black hole .",
    "the excitation was provided by a slight initial displacement of the black hole , either in space or velocity .",
    "an @xmath0 spiral wave was generated in the nuclear disc ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : m1 ] ) , which disappeared through phase mixing in about 0.5 myr , while the black hole was braked down to the centre by dynamical friction .",
    "the perturbation kept a positive pattern speed @xmath17= 50km / s / pc during about 3 - 4 rotations ( the corresponding period is 0.125 myr ) .",
    "after that only a material arm was precessing at the negative velocity @xmath17= -3.6km / s / kpc until 1 myr .",
    "finally , an unstable @xmath0 mode may also exist in the presence of gas in the centre of m31 ( shu et al , 1990 , junqueira & combes 1996 ) .      even at hst resolution",
    ", the nucleus of m  31 appears as the superposition of two rather smooth components corresponding to p1 and p2 .",
    "the detailed structure of each individual components depends on the decomposition method ( bemn94 , king et al .",
    "1995 ) but the corresponding global parameters seem to vary very little ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize , as already did king et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , that although the brightest point of the nuclear region of m  31 corresponds to p1 , it never contributes more than 0.55 of the total surface brightness ( assuming p2 is symmetric ) and the integrated magnitude of p1 is 2.6 magnitude fainter than of p2 .",
    ".global parameters for p1 and p2 : absolute magnitude in the @xmath18 band , core radius , mean ellipticity , relative position angle ( pa in degrees ) , and displacement ( in arcsecond ) along the nucleus major ( @xmath19 ) and minor - axis ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : init ]",
    "if p1 indeed corresponds to an additional cold stellar system and is spatially close to the centre of the nucleus , its decaying time should be rather short , and the probability to observe such a configuration is very small .",
    "this is the main argument against the falling cluster hypothesis .",
    "however lauer et al ( 1993 ) emphasize that the dynamical friction effects are not well known , and there exist some circumstances where it may shut off .",
    "they privileged the hypothesis of p1 being an external stellar system coming from another nucleus , possibly having its own central bh .",
    "a simple application of the chandrasekhar formula ( see e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) can give us a first estimate of the falling time of a stellar cluster .",
    "for a system of 1.6  @xmath21  @xmath4 , it would take a hubble time to fall in the centre from a radius of a few kpc .",
    "this timescale is strongly dependent on the initial radius @xmath22 , so that only @xmath23  yr are needed for the system to fall from a radius of 6.6  pc ( with @xmath24  @xmath25 , see table  [ tab : init ] and sect .",
    "[ sec : geom ] ) .",
    "however , the application of the chandrasekhar formula here is not appropriate . on one hand",
    ", this formula overestimates the dynamical friction since it assumes a singular isothermal sphere while p1 has entered the core where the density remains constant .",
    "moreover , the gravitational potential is dominated by a central point - like mass , which does not provide friction .    on the other hand ,",
    "our simulations confirm a much more important result already noticed in the case of interacting galaxies by prugniel & combes ( 1992 ) : the chandrasekhar formula underestimates the effect of dynamical friction since it assumes that the accreted system is rigid .",
    "prugniel & combes ( 1992 ) showed that releasing the hypothesis of a rigid satellite increases considerably the friction efficiency . in our experiments ,",
    "the main dynamical friction is indeed due to the deformation of the stellar cluster , a reciprocal effect usually neglected in estimations based on the chandrasekhar formula .",
    "our simulations show that the main effect is due to the tidal forces induced by the central mass concentration which rapidly disrupt the cluster .",
    "the strength of the tidal forces strongly depends on the ratio of the central cluster and nucleus concentrations . for a black hole mass of @xmath26  @xmath4 , the cluster looses 30% of its mass in less than @xmath27 yr .",
    "after @xmath28 yr , they are all spread in a ring - like structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] ) , _ although the centre of gravity of the cluster s particles is close to the centre of the nucleus_. for masses greater than 6  @xmath2  @xmath4 , the black hole dominates the overall gravitational potential in the central 10  pc .",
    "the lifetime of the cluster is then roughly scaled like the inverse of the square root of the central dark mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bhmass ] ) .",
    "we also ran an experiment equivalent to run  # 3 but without the additional central mass . in this run",
    ", the stellar cluster is not disrupted .",
    "on the contrary , it is the nucleus now that suffers strong tidal deformations , and the cluster decays like a rigid body through dynamical friction , produced by the nucleus deformations .",
    "the decay time is then longer , of the order of 3 10@xmath1 yr .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] , we can also see that there is very little transfer of angular momentum between the nucleus and the original cluster : the mean angular momentum had only changed by 10% by the end of the simulation at 4.6  @xmath27 yr .",
    "this result is very similar to the one obtained by charlton & laguna ( 1995 ) at a larger scale : the debris of the globular clusters disrupted by tidal forces mainly follow the original cluster orbit ( i.e. highly eccentric orbits ) .",
    "in most runs presented in this paper , we have launched the cluster with the circular velocity . in run # 5 , we have launched the cluster with a tangential velocity of @xmath29 ( hyperbolic orbit ) and in run # 8 with a purely vertical velocity of 250 @xmath25 . in both cases ,",
    "the distance between the cluster and the central mass concentration increases with time .",
    "this prevents the cluster to be strongly disrupted as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : velo ] ( see also charlton & laguna 1995 ) .",
    "because of the absence of colour gradients , we assumed until now that p1 and p2 have similar stellar populations and mass - to - light ratios .",
    "we have however also explored different mass - to - light ratios ( hereafter @xmath30 ) . for the run # 4",
    ", we fixed the @xmath30 of the cluster to be half the one of the nucleus ( see table  [ tab : init ] ) .",
    "this was achieved by assigning fewer particles to the cluster , which were then used for the nucleus whose total mass was conserved .",
    "the less massive cluster is obviously less concentrated at all times after the launch .",
    "however , its envelope seems to survive longer . to understand this point it is necessary to remember that the initial total energy of the clusters are different in those two runs : in run  # 3",
    "the cluster covers a longer track which induces a larger spreading of the unbound particles .",
    "moreover , the tidal radius of the cluster is significantly smaller ( by about 25% ) in run  # 4 than in run  # 3 .",
    "let us first assume that the stellar cluster is located in the equatorial plane of the ( axisymmetric ) nucleus , and let @xmath31 , @xmath32 be its position and velocity in a reference system centred on p2 where @xmath33 is the line of nodes .",
    "since we observe p1 at about @xmath34 of p2 along the nuclear minor - axis and @xmath6 along the major axis ( lauer et al . 1993 , bemn94 ) , we can write : @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the inclination angle of the nucleus ( @xmath37 edge - on ) . in this case",
    ", the nucleus of m  31 can not be viewed exactly edge - on .",
    "the average axis ratio of the nucleus of @xmath38 of 0.61 can be used to bracket its inclination angle : @xmath39 .",
    "then , the apparent distance of p1 to the major - axis of the nucleus provides us a lower limit for the true distance of p1 to the line of nodes : @xmath40 .",
    "and we have now @xmath41 ( @xmath42  pc at 0.77 mpc ) .",
    "if the near side of the nucleus corresponds to the near side of the main disc of m  31 , i.e. the north - west side ( see fig .  3 of kormendy 1988 ) , we can conclude from the sign of the observed velocities that p1 is going toward the line of nodes of the nucleus .",
    "the projection on the sky gives @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the line - of - sight velocity of p1 .",
    "if we assume now that the cluster is on a circular orbit , we can also write : @xmath45 with @xmath46 the spatial velocity of p1 . using fig .  7 of kormendy & richstone ( data of kormendy & bender 1995 ) , we estimate @xmath44 to be @xmath47  @xmath25(see sect .",
    "[ sec : best ] ) .",
    "this value is very uncertain , but the following calculations can be adapted accordingly .",
    "the projected distance @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) along the nuclear major - axis is @xmath50 ( lauer et al .",
    "1993 , bemn94 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is then minimum ( @xmath53  @xmath25 ) for @xmath54 which gives @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , since we already have observed values for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we only need to get @xmath59 ( or the inclination @xmath36 ) and @xmath60 to know the full position and velocity of the cluster . using the model given in bacon et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for the spatial mass distribution and assuming a supermassive black hole of @xmath61  @xmath4(see sect .",
    "[ sec : best ] ) , it is then possible to roughly constrain the type of orbit of the cluster in terms of these two unknowns @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( as a test particle in a fixed potential ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vp1 ] , where the limits of the regions for elliptic , and hyperbolic orbits are drawn as well as the curves for tangential and radial velocities .",
    "we thus find that there is only one point where p1 can be on a circular orbit : @xmath62 @xmath25for @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vp1 ] ) . taking into account the uncertainty on the true value of @xmath44 and on the circular velocity in the nucleus , fig .",
    "[ fig : vp1 ] indicates that @xmath65 or @xmath66 ( @xmath67 at 0.77 mpc ) .",
    "the core of the cluster could survive only if its central density is larger than the average mass density of the nucleus interior to its orbit .",
    "we have seen in the simulations that the initial central density of the cluster had to be @xmath68 10 times the average density at @xmath69 = 6pc ( including a black hole mass of 7 10@xmath12 m@xmath14 ) .",
    "we therefore expect that the disruption will occur at a radius of @xmath70  pc .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the radius derived for a circular orbit inside the nucleus .",
    "if the stellar cluster follows such an orbit it is then presently being disrupted .",
    "such quasi circular orbits were tried , where the cluster was slowly spiraling in towards the centre because of dynamical friction .",
    "but the stripping of its outer parts was so effective that , although the center of mass of the system did reach the required radius , the remaining core of the globular cluster did not . also , the disruption of the cluster produced a much too large internal velocity dispersion to the stellar debris around the core ; the presently observed low velocity dispersion of p1 strongly suggests that this is not the case yet .",
    "therefore , we must conclude that p1 can not be on a circular orbit around p2 .",
    "finally , for a central dark mass of @xmath71  @xmath4the circular velocity predicted from the model given in bemn94 is smaller than 160  @xmath25at radii larger than @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , if the mass concentration is smaller than @xmath71  @xmath4 , the cluster is on an orbit unbound with respect to the nucleus , and will escape from its gravitational influence ( and might eventually fall back later by friction ) .",
    "we have not explored many different inclinations of the orbital plane . however , as the main influence comes from the central dark mass , the fate of the cluster is mainly determined from its pericentre distance .      the main problem to fit self - consistently the nuclear disc of m31 is its observed thickness , mainly under the assumption of its nearly edge - on inclination .",
    "this requires a relatively high @xmath73-dispersion , while the disc is highly rotating in the plane .",
    "the system relaxes quickly , on time scales of the order of 10@xmath74 yr , and it revealed very difficult to maintain both a rather thick disc , and a high v@xmath75 ratio . with relaxation",
    ", the velocity dispersion tends to become more isotropic , and the rotational velocity decreases with respect to the in - plane dispersion .",
    "to reproduce the high azimutal velocities , a more massive black hole is required , and no good fit was obtained below 8 10@xmath12 m@xmath14 .",
    "we have `` observed '' the simulations by associating a specific luminosity of 50.5  @xmath76per particle as to reproduce the photometric data in the @xmath77 band ( i.e. @xmath78 ) . for the bulge",
    ", we used the axisymmetric surface brightness model given in bemn94 ( including the difference in position angle , see their table  4 ) .",
    "the system ( nucleus + cluster ) was viewed such as the strongest projected peak of the cluster is located at @xmath79  pc and @xmath80  pc from the centre of the nucleus ( see bemn94 ) .",
    "this fixes the three euler angles @xmath81 of the projection .",
    "all the relevant characteristics of the various instrumental set - ups are then taken into account : spatial and spectral pixel sizes , spatial and spectral resolutions .",
    "the point spread function was approximated by a single gaussian function which is thus completely fixed by its width @xmath82 . for the bulge we assumed a gaussian line of sight velocity distribution ( hereafter losvd )",
    "whose first two moments are those of the corresponding isotropic axisymmetric model ( i.e. model a of bemn94 with @xmath83 and the appropriate central dark mass ) .",
    "the obtained total losvds were parametrized with the help of gauss - hermite functions ( see van der marel & franx 1993 )    let us first examine the hypothesis of a projection effect , where the cluster is physically far from the centre of m  31 .",
    "the results of these experiments will be used to constrain a fully self - consistent simulation .",
    "lauer et al . ( 1993 ) argued that the observed photometry and kinematics speaks against a cluster physically far from the centre and seen in projection :    * p1 s luminosity profile is truncated and asymmetric : this is indeed suggestive of an interaction between p1 and p2 .",
    "however , as mentioned by king et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the decomposition is certainly not unique * lauer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) also argued that the positioning of p1 on the nucleus major - axis favors a physical relationship between p1 and p2 .",
    "but this assumes that p2 is seen almost edge - on . moreover , p1 is closer to the major - axis of the bulge . *",
    "the velocity profiles are symmetric , as though p1 did not introduce any perturbation . but",
    "this could come in part from the fact that the observed kinematics is luminosity weighted ( seeing effect , cf sect .",

    "higher velocities for the cluster tend to increase both the peak in the velocity and velocity dispersion profiles , but to reduce the influence on higher order moments .",

    "the cluster was launched at 8.8  pc from the centre with a velocity of 420  @xmath25 .",
    "the cluster has a strong effect on the stability of the nucleus : the outer parts gain energy and inflate , while the center becomes more condensed .",
    "this is difficult to anticipate in the initial conditions , and causes the main discrepancy between this model and the observables : the central surface brightness of p2 is larger in the model than in the hst photometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hst64 ] ) . also , the nucleus has the tendency to dynamically relax towards a more centrally concentrated and flattened system , due to the strong influence of the central dark mass .",

    "the agreement is rather good even for the higher order gauss - hermite moments @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ptiger64 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the isophotes are slightly too flattened which leads to a higher central surface brightness than in the observed image .    at a time @xmath117  years ,",
    "the cluster which lies at about @xmath118 ( 4.1  pc ) is already partially disrupted , although the core still survives with a projected fwhm of @xmath119 .",
    "this is slightly smaller than the value of @xmath6 fwhm derived by king et al .",
    "the spread of the particles of the cluster induced by the tidal forces is accompanied by the creation of a large internal velocity gradient which in projection goes from @xmath120  @xmath25to @xmath121  @xmath25 .",
    "this dilutes the contribution of the cluster to the observed losvds .      at the hst resolution",
    ", the observed kinematics of the nucleus of m  31 should clearly reveal the presence of a superimposed cold cluster .",
    "this is illustrated in fig  [ fig : slithst ] where we have derived the kinematics of the `` self - consistent model '' assuming a pixel size of @xmath122 .",
    "we also present seven corresponding losvds along the line joining p1 and p2 for squared apertures of @xmath123 and @xmath124 and a spectral resolution of 100  @xmath25 .",
    "note the large wings of the losvd at the central position due to the presence of the mass concentration .",
    "there are no significant differences between the observed losvds for the two different apertures .",
    "the velocity ( gaussian fit ) along the major - axis reaches @xmath125  @xmath25on the side opposite to p1 at @xmath126 , and the maximum dispersion is @xmath127  @xmath25at @xmath128 . the maximum positive velocity and the minimum dispersion obviously strongly depend on the true internal kinematics of p1 .",
    "the main prediction for spectrographic observations at the hst resolution is the strong asymmetry in the velocity profile along the p1-p2 line , which is also clearly revealed in the shape of the losvds .",
    "however , whatever p1 corresponds to ( a stellar cluster or a density perturbation ) , the fact that the observed kinematics is weighted by light induce strong asymmetries . finally , as noticed by lauer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , if the cluster has indeed a transverse velocity of @xmath129  @xmath25as in the `` self - consistent model '' presented here , its proper motion should be @xmath130  arcsecond in 10  years .",
    "in this paper we have presented n - body simulations of a stellar cluster falling towards a galactic nucleus .",
    "these experiments were designed to ressemble the central region of m  31 .",
    "first we have shown that it was possible to obtain reasonable fits to all observables , either with a projected stellar cluster ( which served to adapt our initial conditions for the n body simulations ) , or with a stellar cluster close to the nucleus and interacting with it .",
    "the best model considered an initial orbit where the cluster was unbound to the nucleus .",
    "slight discrepancies between this model and the data still remain ( e.g. the nucleus isophotes flattening ) .",
    "this solution is certainly not unique and other significantly different initial conditions ( e.g. the choice of the orbit ) could lead to very similar observables .",
    "second , we have shown that the dynamical friction is even more efficient than previously estimated : the cluster rapidly decays to smaller distances , where it is disrupted through tidal interaction with the bh .",
    "the lifetime of such a cluster is short ( @xmath131 ) at radii smaller than @xmath132  pc if a central dark mass of a few @xmath2  @xmath4is present at the centre .",
    "the main argument against the scenario of a falling cluster is that we must see the m31 nucleus at a very special time .",
    "however , the decaying of a stellar cluster is not a rare phenomenon .",
    "tremaine et al ( 1975 ) proposed that the falling of globular clusters could even be the formation mechanism of the nuclear disc .",
    "orders of magnitude are consistent with the observations , if about 25 clusters have been disrupted to form the nucleus , which mass has grown as @xmath133 .",
    "this means that one cluster is falling every 400 myr ; since it will perturb the brightness distribution during @xmath68 0.2 myr , the probability of the present configuration of the m31 nucleus is about 4 10@xmath134 .",
    "this however includes only globular clusters spiraling in on a quasi - circular orbit .",
    "we have shown that p1 being on a circular orbit is inconsistent with the presence of a central dark mass of a few @xmath2  @xmath4 .",
    "more rapid globular clusters , in hyperbolic orbits , as in one of the scenarii proposed here , would be disrupted , but not slowed down enough to contribute to the nucleus mass .",
    "therefore , we should conclude that the hypothesis of a falling cluster ( e.g. nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy , globular cluster ) remains a viable explanation .",
    "lauer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggested that p1 could survive close to the centre if it contains a secondary black hole of `` substantial mass '' .",
    "the probability of seeing it now in this configuration is even smaller than for a stellar cluster , given the frequencies of black holes .",
    "only if we assume that dark matter in galactic halos is constituted by bhs are the latter more numerous than globular clusters . in the model of lacey & ostriker ( 1985 ) , one of these 10@xmath135 m@xmath14",
    "bh arrives in the centre every 10@xmath13 yrs , and most of the time it merges with the bh already present , or is ejected if there is already a binary bh .",
    "xu & ostriker ( 1994 ) argue that , since fresh bh arrive regularly on the centre , the probability to find a binary bh with a separation of 1.6pc ( as p1-p2 ) is 10% .",
    "it is however difficult to explain why p1 is so bright , without any cusp contrary to p2 .",
    "more stringent is the constraint of a low dispersion at p1 : in the case of a secondary black hole at p1 , the dispersion there should be significantly larger than observed .    our simulations finally served to precise the required bh mass , in the hypothesis of an axisymmetric nucleus : in order to fit the disc thickness and stability requirements",
    ", we need the presence of a mass concentration of at least @xmath136  @xmath4to explain the central stellar velocity and velocity dispersion gradients .",
    "the detection of a strong central uv and x ray source in the centre of m  31 is also in favor of a supermassive black hole .",
    "the main underlying assumption in the kinematical determination of the central dark mass is the _ axisymmetry of the nucleus_. in a forthcoming paper , we will examine the possibility of a triaxial morphology ( i.e. a bar ) for the nucleus of m  31 .",
    "the authors would like to thank roland bacon for fruitful discussions , nicolas cretton , frank van den bosch and luis aguilar for their comments and suggestions , as well as michael rich for communication of data prior to publication .",
