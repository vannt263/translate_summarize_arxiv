    "representation of bioacoustic sequences started with human speech in the 70. speech has been represented and processed during 50 years , yielding to standard and efficient mel filter cepstral coefficients ( mfcc ) .",
    "today new paradigms come from environmental monitoring and species classification , like bird and whales [ 3,5,8 ] .",
    "most of the challengers used fourier decomposition , and small number of systems have been designed by convolutional neural net ( cnn ) [ 13 ] from the raw audio as are the most advanced human speech recognizer .",
    "several evidences suggest that auditory cortical neurons are tuned to complex time varying acoustic features and that auditory cortex consists of several fields that decompose sounds in parallel .",
    "one main difficulty is that such decomposition may vary across species and usual computational auditory cortical processing can not capture such complexity .    a difficulty in learning such optimal filters by cnn is the lack of clean bioacoustic data samples in which many species overlap at the same time .",
    "this paper summarize the properties of chirplet decomposition and gives a new fast implementation allowing to run it online .",
    "third , we illustrate the snr enhancement on real recordings of whale and birds , and we give a perspective with cnn classification showing that chirplet performs better than mel fourier representation .",
    "cortical neurons represent sound efficiently [ 1 ] and electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that ring patterns in specific neural regions can often be predictably correlated with particular sound features [ 2 ] , even if the underlying neural codes that give rise to such correlations remain unclear .",
    "however the main properties of auditory cortex are [ 1 ] : complex patterns of sound feature selectivity , species - specific signal decomposition , dynamic modulation of response characteristics .",
    "the chirplet transform appears to be well suited for our purposes : it subsumes both fourier analysis and wavelet analysis , providing a broad framework for mapping one - dimensional sound waveforms into an n - dimensional auditory parameter space .",
    "it offers the processing that have been described in previous section for different auditory fields , i.e. cortical regions with systematically related response sensitivities .",
    "moreover , chirplet spaces are highly over - complete because there are an infinite number of ways to segment a time - frequency plane , the dictionary is redundant : this corresponds well with the overlapping , parallel signal processing pathways of auditory cortex .",
    "a chirplet can be seen as a complex sinus with increasing or decreasing frequency modulated by a gaussian window .",
    "it is a generalization of wavelets which are a special case of chirplet with a sinus of constant frequency .",
    "when extending the support of the modulated gaussian , one can also retrieve the fourier basis . as a result , and as presented in [ 12 ] , the chirplet transform is a generalization of many known time - frequency representations .",
    "we first present briefly the wavelet transform framework to extend it to chirplets .",
    "given an input signal @xmath0 one can compute a wavelet transform [ 14 ] through the application of multiple wavelets @xmath1 .",
    "a wavelet is an atom with compact support in time and frequency domain which integrates to @xmath2 .",
    "the whole filter bank is derived from a mother wavelet @xmath3 and a set of dilation coefficients following a geometric progression defined as @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the number of octave to decompose and @xmath6 the number of wavelets per octave . as a result",
    ", one can create the filter - bank as the collection @xmath7 .",
    "after application of the filter - bank , one ends up with a time - scale representation , or scalogram , @xmath8 where the complex modulus was applied in order to remove the phase information and contract the space .",
    "it is clear that a wavelet filter - bank is completely characterized by its mother wavelet and the set of scale parameters .",
    "however ,    chirplets define a general class of filters with wavelets and fourier bases as part of this large functional space [ 4 ] .",
    "these filters are generated from a gaussian window determining the time support , and a complex sinus with non constant frequency over time with center - frequency @xmath9 .",
    "since the scope of the parameters leads infinitely many different possible filters , we have to restrain ourselves and thus create only a fixed chirplet filter - bank allowing fast computations.the parameters defining these filters include the time position @xmath10 , the frequency center @xmath9 , the duration @xmath11 and the chirp rate @xmath12 :    @xmath13    we now present the strategy we adopted to select a priori the parameters used for our chirplet filters .",
    "the parameter space is basically of infinite dimension .",
    "similarly to continuous wavelet transform however , it is possible to use some a priori knowledge in order to create a finite bank - filter .",
    "for example , wavelets are generated by knowing the number of wavelets per octave and the number of octave to decompose . as a result",
    ", we used the same motivation in order to reduce the number of possible chirplets required .",
    "the goal here is not to compute an invertible transform but rather provide a redundant transformation highlighting transient structures . as a result we chose to chose keep the same framework as for wavelets with the @xmath6 and @xmath5 parameters .",
    "standard parameters to analyze bird songs are @xmath14 and @xmath15 with a sampling rate of @xmath16hz .",
    "in addition , the chirp rate was proportional and the duration was included in it too .",
    "finally , since we are interested in frequency modulations , we compute the ascendant and descendant chirp filters as one being the symmetrized version of the other .    as a result",
    ", we chose to use a more straightforward analytical formula defined with a starting frequency @xmath17 , an ending frequency @xmath18 and the usual wavelet like parameters @xmath19 being the bandwidth .",
    "finally another hyper - parameter fixed constant for the whole bank - filter generation is the parameter @xmath20 defining the order of the chirp .",
    "the case @xmath21 leads to a linear chirp , @xmath22 to a quadratic chirp . the starting and ending frequencies",
    "are chosen so that they approximately cover one octave and are directly computed from the @xmath23 parameters .",
    "the @xmath23 parameters define the scales .    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27",
    "we propose a new fast chirplet transform ( fct ) taking advantage of the a priori knowledge for the filter - bank creation and the fast convolution algorithm discussed in [ opti_fft ] .",
    "therefore , we first create the chirplet with the ascendant and descendant versions in once with :    ....      input : f0,f1,fs , sigma , p      output : coefficients_upward , coefficients_downward      if(p ) :          w = cos(2*pi*((f1-f0)/((p+1)*sigma**p)*t**p+f0)*t )      else :          w = cos(2*pi*((f0*(f1/f0)**(t / sigma)-f0)*sigma / log(f1/f0 ) ) )      coefficients_upward = w*exp(-((t-\\sigma/2.0)**2)/(2*sigma**2 ) )      coefficients_downward = flipud(coefficients_upward ) .",
    "....      then we generate the whole filter - bank by using the previous algorithm with the defined @xmath23 and hyper - parameters :    ....      input : j , q , fs , sigma , p      lambdas             = 2.0**(1+arrange(j*q)/float(q ) )      start_frequencies   = ( fs /lambdas)/2.0      end_frequencies     = fs",
    "/lambdas      distances           = 2.0*d / flipud(lambdas )      filters = list ( )      for f0,f1,d in zip(start_frequencies , end_frequencies , distances ) :          filters.append(chirplet(fs,f0,f1,d,p ) )      return filters .",
    "....    finally , we also used the scattering framework .",
    "mallat et al .",
    "[ 10,11 ] developed the scattering coefficients @xmath28 which are the result of a time - averaging on the time - frequency representation @xmath29 bringing local time - invariance .",
    "this time - averaging is computed through the application of a scaling function @xmath30 which is usually a gabor function with specified standard deviation . as a result",
    ", one computes these coefficients as @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , we performed local time - averaging on the chirplet representation in the same manner .    .",
    "( sampling rate 16 khz , 16 bits . ) ]    we present some possible filters in fig .",
    "[ fig : my_label_chirps ] .    0.45 .",

    "[ fig : my_label_chirps ]      the third step in our fct consists in the reduction of the convolution task .",
    "the asymptotic complexity of the chirplet transform is @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the size of the input signal .",
    "this is the same asymptotic complexity as for the continuous wavelet transform and the scattering network .",
    "however , it is possible to reach lower asymptotic complexity simply by a division of the convolution task .",
    "usually the convolutions are carried through application of an element - wise multiplication of the signal and the filter in the frequency domain and then compute the inverse fourier transform to end up with @xmath34 .    however ,",
    "if we denote by @xmath35 the length of the filter @xmath36 it is possible to instead perform multiple times this operation on different overlapping chunks of the signal to then concatenate the results to obtain at the end the same convolution result but now in @xmath37 .",
    "finally a last improvement induced by this approach is to allow easy tackling of signals with a length just above a power of @xmath38 which otherwise would require to be padded in order to obtain a fft with real @xmath32 complexity through the danielson - lanczos lemma [ 9 ] .    applying this scheme allowed to compute the convolutions between @xmath39 to @xmath40 times faster .",
    "the variations came from the distance between @xmath33 and the closest next power of @xmath38 depending on the desired chunk size .",
    "we defined a simple procedure to optimize the appropriate basis functions of the chirplets according to the maximisation of the snr gain of the time frequency targets in the fourier domain versus in the chirplet decomposition .",
    "we validated also the efficiency of our fast implementation on real bioacoustic recordings .",
    "first we processed on 10 usual cpus ( 4 year old ) in 2 days the whole 999 bird species data set from lifeclef bird challenge ( 16 khz sampling rate , 16 bits , nearly 100 hours of recordings ) .",
