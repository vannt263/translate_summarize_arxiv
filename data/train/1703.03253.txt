    "thanks to the boron - like electrons at the fermi level ; at the same time also the @xmath0 states of mg donate their electrons to the boron - derived conduction bands ( _ metallic _ b ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that b vacancies ( a common defect occurring in diborides ) enhance the dos even further ( more than twice for doping of about 0.5%).@xcite besides the many similarities with mgb@xmath1 , the lower @xmath25 values ( 7.31 and 8.33k instead of 39k ) are accounted for by the differences in the electronic structure and fermi surface .",
    "the dos per unit cell of mgb@xmath1 at the fermi level ( 0.719states / ev ) is dominated ( about 60% ) by the @xmath51 orbitals of b atoms , while in the case of the undoped transition - metal diborides ( zrb@xmath1 , for instance ) 80% of the dos ( 0.130states / ev)@xcite derives from the @xmath13 orbitals of the cation . furthermore , our data support the hypothesis that we are dealing with new two - band two - gap @xmath0-wave superconductors , since the coexistence of a normal and a superconducting phase below @xmath25 suggests an anisotropy of the upper critical field , as well documented in the paradigmatic case of mgb@xmath1 .",
