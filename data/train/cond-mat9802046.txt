    "measurements of electrical properties of a - are reported in this paper over a wide temperature and frequency range .",
    "results indicate that electrical properties can be explained on the basis of widely accepted modified - correlated barrier hopping ( m - cbh ) model for chalcogenide glasses .",
    "ingots of glassy material were prepared by melt quench method .",
    "the 99.99% pure elements were sealed in an evacuated ( @xmath6 torr ) quartz ampoule ( 12 mm diameter and 160 mm long ) .",
    "the ampoule was heated in a muffle furnace at the reaction temperature ( 630 @xmath7c for 24 hr ) .",
    "the composition ( sb : se:1:1 ) of the glasses was determined by edax and amorphous nature was verified by x - ray diffraction pattern obtained using by x - ray diffractometer ( philips pw 1130/60 ) .",
    "the pellets of 0.677 cm diameter were prepared in the hydraulic press at a pressure of @xmath8 .",
    "the measurements were carried out in a specially designed vacuum cell in the temperature range 233 to 313 k and frequencies from 6 hz to 100 khz .",
    "a sophisticated computer controlled ac - impedance system ( model 5206 , eg & g , parc usa ) was used for the measurements @xcite .",
    "polished samples with a thickness 0.04 - 0.10 cm and area 0.36 @xmath9 were put in contact with aquadag ( a conducting emulsion ) in a sandwich configuration .",
    "the sample was kept in vacuum in a copper sample holder ensuring no temperature gradient between the electrods and the sample .",
    "the effect of temperature is studied by using a closed cycle refrigerator ( model f-70 , julabo ) was used to obtain different temperatures , which can maintain constant temperature within @xmath10 1 k for all the measurements .",
    "ohmic contacts were confirmed through linear i - v characterstics in the voltage range .",
    "all electrical measurements of real and imaginary components of impedance parameters ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and real and imaginary component of admittance parameters ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) were made over a wide range of temperature ( 233 to 313 k ) and frequency ( 6 hz to 100 khz ) .",

    "the activation energy @xmath0e and @xmath18 for the sample are found to be 0.43 ev and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "it has also been observed that @xmath0e is constant for different pellets ( thickness = 0.04 cm to 0.08 cm ) with a statistical error of 0.3% .",
    "the variation of @xmath20 versus @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) indicates that the impedance is sensitive to frequency at lower temperatures and gradually becomes independent of frequency with increase in temperature .",
    "this type of behaviour indicates dominance of band conduction at higher temperatures .",
    "the sensitivity of to temperature is shown in fig .",
    "the figure gives the nyquist plots ( @xmath11 versus @xmath12 ) for at different temperatures over the frequency range studied .",
    "the semicircular nyquist plots indicate dipolar nature of the sample , which may be due to hopping back and forth of bipolarons between charged defects states ( d@xmath22 and d@xmath23 ) reported to be present in chalcogenides @xcite .",
    "the size of the nyquist plots reduces with rise in temperature and regain their original size when temperature is increased .    the nyquist plots for form a perfect arc of a semicircle with its centre lying considerably below the abscissa ( i.e. , distribution parameter @xmath24 ) .",
    "figure [ f4 ] also gives the value of @xmath25 calculated at different temperatures .",
    "in dielectric materials , the finite value of the distribution parameter @xmath25 and a depressed arc are typical for a dipolar system involving multirelaxation processes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "but the dependence of @xmath25 on temperature indicates that the mean position of the dipole is varying with variation in temperature .",
    "the dipolar nature of is further confirmed by investigating the variation of capacitance with temperature at different frequencies .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ f5 ] that in the lower temperature range the value of c is nearly constant and it increases with increase in temperature .",
    "however the rate of change of capacitance ( i.e. , dc / dt ) is higher for lower frequencies and decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "these results can be explained by the fact that thermally assisted hopping results in increasing the capacitance of the material . in other words , in the lower temperature range , the dipoles remain frozen and attain rotational freedom when the temperature is increased .",
    "thus the relaxation effects are confirmed by the rate of increase in capacitance with frequency .",
    "the inversion of nyquist plots in the admittance plane are shown in the fig .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the angle of inclination is less than @xmath26 .",
    "this type of behaviour has been explained on the basis of r - c network model ( fig .",

    "( below 273 k ) it is almost constant , while after a certain temperature ( 276 - 278 k ) it shows a sudden decrease , which implies a change in the conduction mechanism .",

    "the @xmath27 dominates over @xmath29 at lower temperatures , while @xmath29 dominates at higher temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ f8 ] ) .",
    "the modified correlated barrier hopping ( m - cbh ) model explains the experimental results reported in this paper .",

    "conductivity in these semiconductors .",
    "dipolar multi - relaxation behaviour of this sample is already indicated from the nyquist plots described in the last subsection .",

    "conductivity is given by @xcite _",
    "ac = [ e4 ] where @xmath31 is the number of polarons involved in the hopping process , @xmath32 is proportional to the square of the concentration of the states and @xmath33 is the dielectric constant .",

    "it is evident from the figure that @xmath38 is very sensitive to temperature in the higher temperature regime .",
    "the low temperature a.c .",
    "conduction can be explained by considering bipolaron hopping between d@xmath22 and d@xmath23 centers whereas the higher temperature behaviour is due to thermally activated single polaron hopping . at higher temperatures",
    "a number of thermally generated d@xmath39 centers are produced with a temperature dependent concentration @xcite n_0 = n_t ( - u_eff /2 kt ) [ e6 ] where @xmath40 is the concentration of d@xmath22 or d@xmath23 centers at @xmath41 .",

    "conductivity data calculated from the experiments .",
    "the behaviour of eqn.[e10 ] ( @xmath52 ) can be seen in the fig .",
    "this indicates that @xmath53 follows @xmath54 for lower temperatures and @xmath50 for higher temperatures .",
    "figure [ f9 ] also shows a sudden change in conduction mechanism at a certain temperature ( 276 - 278k ) .",
    "the similar behaviour is noticed in the admittance plots ( fig .",
    "the different parameters used for cbh model calculations are as following further , the effect of temperature and frequency on the hopping length @xmath55 , which is a measure of the effective length of a dipole can be studied using cbh model .",
    "the variation of @xmath34 with frequency at different temperature is shown in the fig .",
    "the figure indicates that @xmath56 is more sensitive to frequency in the high temperature regime and the sensitivity decreases with decreasing temperature .",
    "thus at low temperature , @xmath34 is constant with frequency , which implies a constant value of capacitance which is found to be true from the fig .",
    "nyquist plots or complex impedance studies confirm the dipolar nature of and multi - relaxation behaviour as seen in most chalcogenide glasses .",
    "these plots also indicate that the capacitive nature dominates over the resistive nature of the sample at lower temperature ( @xmath57 k ) , while the resistive nature is dominant at higher temperatures .",
