    "recent progress on the experimental realization of ultracold dipolar quantum fluids is providing an unprecedented opportunity to study these systems in detail .",
    "interesting dipolar effects have been demonstrated in systems with modest dipolar interactions , such as bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of @xmath0cr  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the achievement of a near - quantum - degenerate gas of fermionic @xmath1k@xmath2rb  @xcite , the transfer of bosonic @xmath3k@xmath2rb into its rovibrational ground state  @xcite and the cooling and trapping of atomic dy  @xcite shows promise of a rich future for this field as these species host large dipole moments that may demonstrate new physics both in the mean - field regime and beyond .",
    "because of the anisotropic nature of the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) , the physics of a dipolar system depends strongly on the geometry of the trap in which it is held .",
    "for example , inelastic scattering processes of both bosonic and fermionic species are predicted to be highly suppressed in tighter , quasi - two dimensional ( q2d ) traps when the trap is applied along the polarization axis of the dipoles  @xcite .",
    "this suppression leads to more stable , longer - lived many - body systems of reactive species .",
    "additionally , it was shown using a bec of atomic @xmath0cr that tighter confinement in the polarization direction energetically stabilizes a dipolar bec ( dbec ) against collapse  @xcite .",
    "so , tight trapping along the polarization axis is necessary to obtain stable , high density dipolar quantum fluids .",
    "such a trap is realizable in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice , where a laser is reflected onto itself and high and low intensity regions are formed by its interference pattern .",
    "the presence of the lattice brings up an interesting point regarding the physics of such a system . while the ddi is anisotropic , it is also long - range , scaling as @xmath4 , and if the lattice spacing is sufficiently small then the effect of the ddi is non - negligable between the lattice sites . for example , interlayer superfluidity is predicted to exist in two adjacent layers of polar fermions  @xcite , and scattering in the 2d plane is predicted to be significantly modified by the presence of a weakly bound state of dipoles in adjacent layers  @xcite .",
    "dramatic effects are predicted for layers of bosons , as well , for both q2d",
    "@xcite and radially trapped  @xcite lattice sites .",
    "the presence of the lattice is predicted to significantly alter the dispersion via the softening of a roton - like mode in the system , and thus to alter the stability properties of the bose gas .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a gas of bosonic dipoles in a 1d lattice with the dipoles polarized along the lattice axis , so that the system is cylindrically symmetric . assuming that the lattice recoil is sufficiently large , we model the potentials of the individual sites as cylindrically symmetric harmonic traps . at ultracold temperatures , this leads to a lattice of non - overlapping dbecs coupled by the long - range ddi .",
    "we study the stability of this system both for an infinite and finite 1d lattice .",
    "additionally , we find regions in parameter space where biconcave structure is predicted to exist that is emergent in the lattice system , in other words , that does not exist in a single condensate . to ensure the accuracy of our results ,",
    "we calculate the elementary excitations of the system and use them to determine whether our solutions are dynamically stable . in doing so , we map the structure and stability of 1d lattice of purely dipolar dbecs .",
    "we consider an ultracold , dilute gas of bosonic dipoles in a 1d optical lattice in the @xmath5-direction with lattice spacing @xmath6 .",
    "if the lattice is sufficiently deep , it can be modeled by a series of @xmath7 harmonic traps , where each site is described by a cylindrically symmetric potential @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the individual bosons and @xmath10 is the trap aspect ratio .",
    "this system is well - described by the coupled set of non - local gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the non - interacting , or single - particle hamiltonian @xmath13 @xmath14 is the condensate wavefunction at site @xmath15 , @xmath15 is an integer and @xmath16 is the corresponding chemical potential . without the presence of the long - range dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) , these @xmath7 equations would be independent .",

    "this interaction is short - range , and results in the mean - field potential @xmath35 .",
    "modeling a system of non - overlapping becs in a 1d lattice interacting only via contact interactions results in a set of uncoupled gpes . while the interplay of contact and ddi interactions is predicted to produce interesting effects  @xcite that would likely be modified by the presence of the lattice , we set @xmath36 in this work to illuminate purely dipolar effects .",
    "because of its long - range nature , the ddi does not produce a simple mean - field like the contact interaction , and requires particular attention .    in practice",
    ", the dipolar mean - field is calculated in @xmath37-space to eliminate the problems associated with the divergence of the ddi in real - space . to do this , the fourier transforms of the densities @xmath38 and",

    "for a single dbec , calculating the mean - field energy on a full numeric grid has proven fruitful  @xcite , however , this method is very computationally expensive when considering multiple interacting dbecs , both in real- and @xmath37-space . in real - space ,",
