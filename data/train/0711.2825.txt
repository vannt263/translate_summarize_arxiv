    "in the search for long - lived , low - order p modes , the classic methods of peak - fitting the individual-@xmath0 spectra fail because of the decrease in mode amplitudes and increase in solar convective motions ( solar noise ) as the frequency decreases , reducing the signal - to - noise ratio ( hereafter snr ) of those modes .",
    "instead , various pattern - recognition techniques have been developed in an effort to reveal the presence of modes in the low - frequency range . in the case of spatially - resolved helioseismic data ( for example observations collected by the space - based soho / mdi instrument and the ground - based multi - site gong network ) , @xmath0-averaged spectra appeared to be a powerful tool .",
    "they were employed early in the development of helioseismology @xcite , but have been replaced by fitting the @xmath0-spectra individually as the quality of the data improved .",
    "years later , in order to fully take advantage of the long - duration helioseismic mdi and gong instruments , @xmath0-averaged spectra corrected by the modeled solar rotation were used to detect new low radial - order p modes and to put some upper limits on the detectability of the g modes @xcite .",
    "these authors demonstrated the potential advantage of such rotation - corrected @xmath0-averaged spectra .",
    "we present here an adaptation of the @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique in which the @xmath0-dependent shift parameters are determined .",
    "the accurate observation of low - frequency modes is a difficult task because of two main reasons .",
    "first , the amplitude of the acoustic modes decreases as the mode inertia increases as the frequency decreases , while the `` solar noise '' from incoherent , convective motions increases ; thus the snr of those modes is progressively reduced .",
    "second , these low - frequency p modes have very long lifetimes , as much as several years .",
    "these two effects together render the observation of such low - amplitude and long - lived modes a difficult task to achieve .",
    "however , thanks to several long - duration space- and ground - based instruments , more than 11 years of high - quality helioseismic data are available today .",
    "the observation of low radial - order solar p modes is becoming possible if we can somehow improve the snr of these modes .",
    "the classic peak - fitting analysis consists of fitting the @xmath3 individual-@xmath0 spectra of a given multiplet ( @xmath4 ) , either individually or simultaneously .",
    "such fitting methods fail to obtain reliable estimates of the mode parameters when the snr is very low .",
    "instead , for a given multiplet ( @xmath4 ) , the mean of @xmath3 low - snr spectra can result in an average spectrum with a snr @xmath5 1 once the individual-@xmath0 spectra are corrected for the rotation- and structure - induced shifts .",
    "a model of the solar rotation can be used @xcite or , as described in this paper , we can also determine the shifts as we are searching for the low - frequency modes .",
    "the @xmath0-averaged spectrum is obtained by finding the best estimates of the splitting coefficients , commonly called @xmath6-coefficients , which yield the narrowest peak in the averaged spectrum .",
    "the @xmath6-coefficients are individually estimated through an iterative process .",
    "then , for a given mode ( @xmath1 ) , the frequency shift @xmath7 is parameterized by a set of coefficients , as :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 are the splitting coefficients , and @xmath10 corresponds to the clebsch - gordan polynomial expansion @xcite .            for a particular order @xmath11 of the coefficients @xmath12 , a range of values",
    "is scanned around the current value , while the other @xmath13s are kept fixed .",
    "for each scanned value of @xmath12 , the individual-@xmath0 spectra are shifted by the corresponding clebsch - gordan polynomials , and the mean of these @xmath3 shifted spectra is taken .",
    "the mean of @xmath3 independent power densities , which has a @xmath14 with more than 2 d.o.f .",
    "statistics , can be correctly fitted with a maximum - likelihood estimator ( mle ) minimization code developed for spectra following a @xmath14 with 2 d.o.f .",
    "statistics if the snr of each @xmath0-spectrum is comparable @xcite .",
    "the mean power spectrum is then mle fitted by a lorenztian profile and its full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) determined .",
    "when all of the scans are performed , the corresponding fwhms can be seen as a figure - of - merit ( fom ) . as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : fom ] , the foms of the @xmath12s clearly show well - defined minima , the peak profile getting narrower as the @xmath6-coefficients converge to their best estimates .",
    "the uncertainties ( @xmath15 ) are defined as the formal uncertainties of the fits to the minima .",
    "this iterative procedure is performed until the difference between two iterations in each of the computed coefficients @xmath12 falls below a given threshold ( @xmath16 nhz ) .",
    "a more realistic and detailed description of the different effects responsible for lifting the degeneracy of the mode frequency into @xmath3 multiplets needs the use of more splitting coefficients @xmath12 in eq .",
    "[ eq : poly ] than we have shown here , and is currently underway .",
    "finally , the mode parameters ( central frequency , linewidth , @xmath17 ) are extracted by fitting the @xmath0-averaged spectrum once the individual-@xmath0 spectra are corrected by the best estimates of the splitting coefficients .",
    "however , the formal uncertainties must be normalized by @xmath18 @xcite . but this a - posteriori error normalization is correct only if the @xmath3 spectra of a given ( @xmath1 ) mode have the same snr .",
    "the snrs of the @xmath0-spectra inside a multiplet are not the same in our data , and the uncertainties of the mode parameters have to be taken as a lower limit only .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec_l4 ] illustrates the advantage of using the @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique in the case of the mode @xmath19 at @xmath20 1187 @xmath21hz for 2088 days of gong data , where the @xmath0-averaged spectra before and after the correction of the @xmath0-spectra for the splitting coefficients are presented . the fitted central frequency ( i.e. @xmath22 ) and @xmath6-coefficients @xmath23 ( determined as on fig .",
    "[ fig : fom ] ) of the mode @xmath19 are also given on fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_l4 ] .",
    "the corresponding @xmath24 diagram before correction ( upper - right panel on fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_l4 ] ) does not show any high snr structure , while after correction ( lower - right panel on fig .",

    "in the routine analysis , the gong and mdi projects use two separate peak - finding pipelines to extract the mode parameters .",
    "those pipelines , developed in the early 1990s and mostly unchanged since , provide mode parameters on a routine basis .",
    "time series of 108 days are used by the gong project @xcite , while the mdi project uses 72-day time series @xcite .",

    "this new peak - fitting pipeline has been used to extract the low- and medium - degree ( @xmath30 ) mode parameters on both gong and mdi observations using one 2088-day long time series , as well as using five overlapping segments of 728 days @xcite . in order to compare our results obtained with the @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique",
    ", we applied the procedure described in sec .",

    "[ fig : lnu2088d ] , the @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique allows us to measure a significantly larger number of low - frequency modes in gong data down to @xmath20 900 @xmath21hz , and to fill in the gaps in the @xmath31 diagram obtained by fitting the individual-@xmath0 spectra @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique is clearly effective in the low - frequency range where classic peak - fitting methods are limited by the low signal - to - noise ratio of each individual-@xmath0 component .",

    "the @xmath0-averaged spectrum technique , in which we determine the correction for the splitting coefficients ( i.e. , @xmath6-coefficients ) , allows us to measure lower frequencies in gong data than with classic peak - fitting methods of the individual-@xmath0 spectra , which are limited by the low signal - to - noise ratio of these low - radial order modes .",
    "we are currently in the process of generalizing the method with a larger number of @xmath6-coefficients , both odd and even orders .",
    "we are also going to apply this technique to the mdi data",
