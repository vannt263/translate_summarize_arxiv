    "x - ray absorption and emission features arising from iron k - shell processes are of practical importance in high - energy astrophysics .",
    "this is primarily due to the iron cosmic abundance , but also to the relatively unconfused spectral region where they ubiquitously appear .",
    "although the observational technology in x - ray astronomy is still evolving , many of such features are being resolved and consequently exploited in plasma diagnostics . in this respect , they are naturally grouped according to their origin , i.e. bound  bound or bound ",
    "free ionic transitions , and much of the interpretation of the latter has relied on atomic calculations @xcite that predict a sharp increase of the photoabsorption cross section at the k - shell threshold .",
    "the purpose of this communication is to emphasize that this commonly held view is incorrect due to an oversimplified treatment of the decay pathways of the resonances converging to this limit , and that previous astrophysical inferences from k - edge structures should thus be revised .",
    "when a photon is sufficiently energetic to promote a k - shell electron to an excited rydberg state , the latter decays through radiative and autoionization ( auger ) transitions . illustrating these processes in the relatively simple case of ne - like fe  xvii , the photoexcited k - vacancy states @xmath1 have access to the following decay tree : @xmath2 the radiative branches are controlled , as indicated in eqs .",
    "( [ beta][alpha ] ) , by the k@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) array at @xmath5   and the k@xmath6 ( @xmath7 of which the most salient is the k@xmath8 array at @xmath9  . c. mendoza",
    ", p. palmeri , t. kallman , & m. bautista ( 2002 , in preparation , hereafter mpkb ) have recently demonstrated that , for any k - vacancy fine - structure state in the fe isonuclear sequence , the width ratio @xmath10 .",
    "equation  ( [ part ] ) contains the participator auger ( kl@xmath6 ) channels where the @xmath6p outer electron is directly involved in the decay . by contrast , in the kll channels ( eq .  [ spec ] ) the @xmath6p rydberg electron remains a spectator .",
    "it has also been demonstrated by mpkb that , for any fe k - vacancy fine - structure state with a filled l shell , the total k@xmath3 and kll widths are practically independent of both the principal quantum number @xmath11 of the outer - electron configuration and the electron occupancy @xmath12 , and keep a ratio of @xmath13 .",
    "these findings illustrate the works of gauss s law at the atomic scale as previously reasoned by @xcite regarding the inner - shell properties of kr and sn .",
    "furthermore , mpkb have also determined that auger decay is 94% dominated by the kll channels in fe  xvii and by no less than 70% in fe  x. since both the k@xmath6 and kl@xmath6 widths decay with the effective quantum number as @xmath14 , the total widths of k - vacancy states within an isonuclear sequence may certainly be assumed constant for @xmath15 for all members with @xmath16 .",
    "in line with the previous discussions by @xcite and @xcite , the width constancy of high-@xmath6 k resonances within an isonuclear sequence for members with @xmath16 procure indelible effects on the threshold structures of their photoabsorption cross sections which have indeed been measured in the laboratory in o  i and ne  i but seriously underestimated in many atomic calculations .",
    "we make use of the breit ",
    "pauli r - matrix ( bprm ) method @xcite to study k damping in fe  xvii .",
    "this numerical approach is based on the close - coupling approximation whereby the wavefunctions for states of an @xmath17-electron target and a colliding electron are expanded in terms of a finite number of target eigenfunctions . as can be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) , bprm calculations of photoionization or electron impact excitation cross sections can handle the spectator auger channels only for low-@xmath6 k resonances since the close - coupling expansion must explicitly include @xmath18 target states .",
    "however , @xcite has modified bprm to implicitly account for the spectator auger channels by means of an optical potential devised from multichannel quantum defect theory .",
    "a target - state energy now acquires the imaginary component @xmath19 where @xmath20 is its partial decay width .",
    "this treatment of spectator auger decay is thus analogous to that of radiation damping @xcite .    in order to discern the contributions of the kll channels to the total auger widths ,",
    "several bprm calculations are carried out for the @xmath21 system .",
    "firstly , only target levels from the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 configurations are included in the expansion thus only accounting for participator auger decay . in a second calculation ,",
    "levels from the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 configurations with @xmath28 are added to the target representation which now maps out the complete auger manifold for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 resonances . in table",
    "[ widths ] , the resulting auger widths for these resonances are compared , where increases by kll decay greater than an order of magnitude and constant total auger widths are depicted .    in a further calculation , the bprm+optical potential approach of @xcite is employed to study the effects of radiation and auger damping on the resonance structure .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the photoabsorption cross section of the @xmath31 ground state of fe  xvii in the near k - threshold region .",
    "it may be seen that the undamped cross section is populated by a double series ( @xmath32 ) of narrow and asymmetric resonances that converge to a sharp k edge .",
    "the inclusion of radiation ( k@xmath3 ) and auger ( kll ) dampings leads to resonance series with constant widths and symmetic profiles that get progressively smeared with @xmath6 to produce a smooth transition through the k threshold ; in low resolution , the edge would thus appear to be downshifted in energy .",
    "the symmetric profiles are , as discussed by @xcite , a consequence of the fact that kll channels give rise to continuum states that can only be reached by dipole forbidden direct photoionization of the ground state and thus cause the fano @xmath33-parameter to tend toward infinity .",
    "with respect to radiation damping , the dominance of the k@xmath3 over the auger participator channels causes the modified fano @xmath33-parameter @xcite to be large , so as to also yield a symmetric profile .",
    "resonance smearing is the result of oscillator strength conservation which must enforce an approximate @xmath34 reduction of the resonance peak - values due to their constant widths .",
    "an advantage of the simple behavior of k damping in fe is that its impact on the opacities can be estimated with an analytic model .",
    "the latter has been established and validated with the bprm photoabsorption cross section of fe  xvii : the damped @xmath35 resonances are fitted with lorentzian profiles and extrapolated with @xmath36 assuming constant widths and intensities decreasing with @xmath34 , the resonance positions being deduced by the usual ritz formula .",
    "the cross sections of all the other fe ions in the near threshold region are then determined in a similar fashion assuming a single @xmath37 rydberg series of smeared resonances for each species with @xmath38 for @xmath39 , @xmath11 for @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "since the resonance widths can be assumed constant with @xmath17 for @xmath12 ( mpkb ) , they are assigned the value of the 3p resonances in fe  xvii , namely , @xmath43 ryd . for @xmath44 , this value",
    "is scaled by a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "the resonance intensities of the first few members of each series are obtained from multiplet @xmath46-values computed with the atomic structure code hfr @xcite , and the k - threshold positions and background cross sections are taken from @xcite .",
    "the monochromatic opacities are generated with the xstar program @xcite ; the self - consistent ionization balance and electron temperature are computed under the assumption that ionization and heating are primarily due to an external source of continuum photons and that all processes are in a steady state .",
    "solar abundances and a @xmath47 continuum power law are adopted . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , results are characterized in terms of the familiar ionization parameter @xmath48 in the range @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the luminosity of the incident x - ray radiation , @xmath6 the gas density , and @xmath51 the distance from the radiation source .",
    "two distinctive spectral signatures emerge : ( i ) the concept of a sharp edge only applies for lowly ionized ( @xmath52 ) plasmas , and its progressive broadening is a function of ionization ; ( ii ) for @xmath53 , a strong absorption feature appears at the piedmont ( @xmath54 kev ) caused by the k@xmath0 unresolved transition array ( uta ) .    the features produced by the smeared resonances on the k - edge opacities really stand out in a comparison with opacities computed with undamped photoionization cross sections .",
    "the latter can be approximated by replacing the lorentzian profiles with fano type with constant asymmetry parameters @xmath55 , i.e. , the undamped value for the 3p resonance in fe  xvii .",
    "the undamped widths are obtained with hfr for the first members of each series and scaled down by @xmath56 for the higher .",
    "the resonant cross section is deduced from the following approximate formula : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , calculated with hfr , is the oscillator strength for the transition between the ground state and the noninteracting resonance , @xmath59 is the resonance width , and @xmath60 is the oscillator strength for the transition between the ground and the continuum states and is proportional to the resonant cross section . a comparison between damped and undamped opacities at @xmath61 = 10 is shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig3 ] , in which the steady upclimb in the former is replaced by sharp steps in the latter .",
    "moreover , the role of resonances in the damped case , in particular the k@xmath0 uta , becomes more dominant .",
    "broad k - edge absorption structures have been widely observed in the x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei and black - hole candidates as reviewed by @xciteand more recently reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they have been interpreted in terms of the reflection of x - rays by optically thick accretion disks around central compact objects , partial absorption models , or relativistic broadening .",
    "furthermore , an unidentified local absorption feature at @xmath62 kev just below a smeared k edge has been reported by @xcite in the bright x - ray nova gs 112468 and by @xcite in the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ; in this respect , the fitted ionization parameter ( @xmath63 ) in the latter seems to support our predicted edge signatures .",
    "it is expected that the present findings will contribute to a more realistic spectral modeling above 7 kev that has recently been described as critical by @xcite .",
    "however , quantitative modeling implies a revision of the inner - shell photoionization cross sections for the fe isonuclear sequence which is currently underway .",
