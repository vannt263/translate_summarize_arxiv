    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) provides a natural setting for distributed quantum information processing ( qip )  @xcite .",
    "atoms in highly detuned cavities may be used to store qubits in decoherence - free environments , while photons are well suited to distribute information throughout the system .",
    "the strong coupling that can be achieved between atoms and cavity field modes can be used to perform logic operations  @xcite .",
    "the physics of cavity qed can also be realized in a solid - state analog known as `` circuit qed , '' in which superconducting qubits are coupled to stripline resonators  @xcite .",
    "circuit qed offers several advantages over traditional cavity qed , including extremely high dipole moments that result in large couplings , a fixed number of qubits in a cavity , and improved scalability",
    ".    one requirement of distributed qip is the coupling of distant qubits in order to perform state transfer , entanglement generation , or quantum gate operations between separate nodes of the system . in cavity qed ,",
    "two atoms may be coupled by connecting the cavities in which they are confined via an optical fiber . in an early proposal",
    "@xcite for state transfer in this system , the atomic state is converted into a superposition of fock states of the cavity field mode .",
    "this photonic state then propagates along the fiber to the second cavity , where it is transferred to the second atom .",
    "such a technique , however , is susceptible to decoherence due to losses from the cavity or fiber modes . to decrease these losses , systems of adiabatic transfer",
    "have been devised , using a sequence of laser pulses to transfer an atomic state without populating intermediate states .",
    "it is possible to minimize the population of the cavities  @xcite or the fiber  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the fiber mode can be eliminated from the dynamics if the cavity - fiber coupling is sufficiently strong  @xcite .",
    "high - fidelity swap and entangling gates may then be produced by turning the atom - cavity interaction on and off .",
    "all these proposals , however , still involve excitation of the field in either the cavities or the fiber .",
    "field excitation can be avoided entirely by coupling two qubits to a single field mode . in cavity qed , this requires two atoms to be confined within the same cavity  @xcite ; in circuit qed , two superconducting qubits are coupled to one stripline resonator  @xcite .",
    "if both qubits are highly detuned from the field mode , the interaction with the field mode becomes dispersive .",
    "thus the field mode is effectively eliminated from the qubit dynamics and an excitation may pass between the two qubits without ever populating the field mode .",
    "this interaction can produce decoherence - free state transfer and entanglement generation .",
    "however , some practical difficulties remain with this scheme .",
    "first , the two qubits , interacting with the same field mode , may not be sufficiently independent to act as separate nodes in distributed qip .",
    "second , there is no way to regulate the qubit - qubit coupling without manipulating the qubits themselves .",
    "recently , considerable theoretical effort has been devoted to a class of coupled - cavity models that promise to overcome the problem of individual adressability .",
    "inspired by experimental advances in photonic crystals  @xcite , optical microcavities  @xcite , and superconducting devices  @xcite , these models typically describe a series of optical cavities , each containing one or more atoms or qubits .",
    "photons are permitted to hop between the cavities .",
    "much of the work on coupled - cavity models has focused on similarities to the bose - hubbard model  @xcite and the prospect of observing quantum phase transitions between mott insulator and superfluid states  @xcite .",
    "coupled - cavity models have potential applications in qip as well , since it should be possible to control and measure individual lattice sites .",

    "state transfer along an array of polaritonic qubits in a coupled - cavity system was studied in  @xcite .",
    "a protocol for producing two - qubit quantum phase gates in a system of quantum dots coupled to photonic crystal nanocavities was outlined in  @xcite .",

    "@xcite studied a system of two weakly coupled cavities .",
    "when atoms are passed successively through each cavity , quantum interference effects appear in the final state of the second atom due to the existence of two field modes .",
    "the authors focused on the case of exact resonance between the atoms and cavity fields .",
    "more recently , nohama and roversi  @xcite addressed the problem of atomic state transfer in a system of two cavities , each containing a trapped two - level atom .",
    "they showed that perfect state transfer occurs periodically , but the analysis was restricted to the case @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the detuning between the atom and cavity field and @xmath2 is the photon hopping strength .    in the present paper ,",
    "we examine the dynamics of a simple two - site coupled - cavity model over a large range of values of the qubit - cavity detuning and the photon hopping strength , focusing particularly on atomic state transfer .",
    "although the exact dynamics of the system is rather complicated in the general case , there are several limiting regimes in which it may be simplified . in each of these limits",
    "we derive an effective hamiltonian that captures the essential physical processes and study the resulting dynamics .",
    "the limits of large hopping and large detuning each lead to dispersive interactions , allowing state transfer between the atoms without excitation of the field . when the hopping and detuning are approximately equal , a resonant interaction between the atoms and a delocalized mode of the field occurs .",
    "fast state transfer involving excitation of the field is possible in this case .",
    "we find , then , that the hopping parameter provides a flexible source of control over the dynamics of the system .",
    "the system under consideration consists of two coupled cavities , each modeled as a single harmonic oscillator mode of frequency @xmath3 ; each cavity contains a single two - level atom with transition frequency @xmath4  .",
    "the atom - cavity interaction is described by the jaynes - cummings model  @xcite , using the rotating - wave approximation  @xcite .",
    "the two cavities are coupled so that photons may hop between them .",

    "correspond to the energy of the bare atoms and field modes , respectively .",
    "the third term represents the transfer of excitations between the atom and field in each cavity .",
    "the exchange of photons between cavities is expressed in the final term of eq .  .",
    "it will prove useful to rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of delocalized field and atomic modes , which are given by the antisymmetric and symmetric superpositions of the states at the localized sites .",
    "the raising operators of the new field modes are given by @xmath15 similarly , the raising operators of the new atomic modes are given by @xmath16 in terms of these operators , eq .   becomes @xmath17 .\\ ] ] in this form , the delocalized atomic mode @xmath18 and the delocalized field mode @xmath19 are governed by a jaynes - cummings - type interaction .",
    "no coupling occurs between the odd and even modes , so that the system hamiltonian takes the form of a sum over two independent jaynes - cummings hamiltonians .",
    "the transition frequency of the delocalized atomic modes remains unchanged at @xmath20 .",
    "however , the frequencies of the delocalized field modes are shifted from the bare cavity frequency : the frequency of mode @xmath19 becomes @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the detuning between the atomic mode @xmath24 and the field mode @xmath19 is thus given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 our study of the dynamics of the system is focused on the problem of state transfer between the atoms .",
    "atom 1 is prepared in an arbitrary superposition of the ground and excited states , while atom 2 is in the ground state and both field modes are in the vacuum state : @xmath27 state transfer between the two atoms occurs when atom 2 is in the same superposition of ground and excited states that atom 1 had initially .",
    "that is , at some time @xmath28 , the state of the system is given by @xmath29 since the hamiltonian conserves total excitation number , the dynamics is restricted to the subspace containing zero or one excitations .",
    "we can thus write the state of the system at time @xmath28 as @xmath30 .",

    "this is most readily seen in the delocalized basis .",
    "it is evident from eq .   that if , for example , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the atomic mode @xmath47 is on resonance with the field mode @xmath48 .",
    "however , provided that @xmath49 , the modes @xmath50 and @xmath51 will be off - resonant and will not contribute significantly to the dynamics on short time scales . away from the resonances at @xmath52 , both atomic modes are detuned from their corresponding field modes and the system dynamics becomes dispersive in nature .",
    "we consider three limiting cases : large hopping ( @xmath53 ) , large detuning ( @xmath54 ) , and near - resonance ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "for each , we determine the effective dispersive - case hamiltonian , which illustrates the important physical processes , and then calculate the explicit single - excitation dynamics from the full solution given in eq .  .",
    "the first limit we examine is the large - hopping limit , in which @xmath56 .",
    "the atoms are highly detuned from both delocalized field modes ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "transitions in which an excitation is passed from atom to field ( or vice versa ) involve the exchange of a large amount of energy and so are strongly supressed .",

    "this transfer of states between atoms in separate cavities without populating the cavity modes has significant practical benefits .",
    "the method of transferring the atomic state to the field and then from the field to the second atom  @xcite is susceptible to decoherence from photon loss in the cavities or optical fibers .",

    "the stark shift due to this term ( which , as @xmath110 , is much smaller than the local effect ) is proportional to the difference between the populations of the two field modes .",
    "the evolution of a single - excitation state reduces to the same equations of motion as in the limit @xmath92 , given by eq .  .",
    "as before , there is no transfer of energy between the field modes and the atoms , and an excitation that is initially in an atom will oscillate between the two atoms at rate @xmath87 .",
    "in contrast with the previous limit , increasing the hopping strength decreases the product @xmath89 , thus increasing both @xmath90 and the interatomic excitation transfer rate .",
    "conversely , increasing @xmath1 decreases the transfer rate .",
    "finally , we turn to the limit in which the atoms are nearly resonant with one of the delocalized field modes . unlike the previous two limits where the atoms were highly detuned from both modes , direct transfer of energy takes place between the atoms and the field , creating a different mechanism for interatomic energy transfer .",
