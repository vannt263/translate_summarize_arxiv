    "the quest for a detailed understanding of heavy - element nucleosynthesis is very intriguing , calling for an extensive knowledge of nuclear properties at the relevant astrophysical energies .",
    "the astrophysical aspects are equally challenging ; the most critical issue is to identify the correct astrophysical sites and conditions in which the heavy - element nucleosynthesis operates  @xcite .",
    "there are three main processes responsible for creating elements heavier than iron  @xcite : the slow neutron - capture ( @xmath8- ) process , the rapid neutron - capture ( @xmath9- ) process , and the @xmath10-process , which in fact includes a variety of nuclear reactions such as photodisintegration of already created @xmath8- and @xmath9-nuclides through e.g. ( @xmath11 ) , ( @xmath12 ) , and ( @xmath13 ) reactions as well as their inverse capture reactions . to this end , only the @xmath8-process astrophysical sites are more or less clearly identified ( low - mass asymptotic giant branch stars , @xmath14 , and massive stars , @xmath15 ; see e.g. ref  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath9-process astrophysical site is still a mystery , suggestions include the neutrino - driven wind following a core - collapse supernova , and neutron - star mergers  @xcite . also the @xmath10-process site remains rather elusive  @xcite ; however , it is clear that conditions with temperatures reaching between 2 to 3 billions degrees must be reached for the @xmath10-process to take place .",
    "the deep o - ne layers of a massive star prior to or in its supernova phase remains the most popular suggestion , though some species , in particular the @xmath10-isotopes of mo and ru , remain underproduced in the present simulations .",
    "type ia supernovae could also contribute to the production of @xmath10-nuclei , but its contribution remains affected by uncertainties in galactic chemical evolution models as well as in the determination of the @xmath8-process enrichment prior to the @xmath10-process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties in the astrophysical modelling , significant uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates bring further complications to our understanding of the nucleosynthesis . in order to estimate theoretically the abundance distribution , very large reaction - network calculations",
    "are required , typically including @xmath16 nuclei and @xmath17 cross sections for the @xmath10-process , and @xmath18 nuclei and @xmath19 cross sections for the @xmath9-process .",
    "obviously , most of these cross sections have not been determined experimentally and will not be measured in the near future .",
    "hence , the calculations rely on theoretical estimates of cross sections and reaction rates . these are usually derived within the hauser - feshbach theory  @xcite , where the main input parameters include optical - model potentials , nuclear level densities , and @xmath0-ray strength functions  ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .        in this work , we have investigated the yttrium isotope @xmath1y by means of the reaction @xmath1y(@xmath2)@xmath1y , utilizing the oslo method  @xcite to extract the nuclear level density ( nld ) and @xmath0-ray strength function ( @xmath0sf ) .",
    "the nld data were previously reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and this work focuses on the @xmath0sf , and in particular the enhancement at low - energy @xmath0 rays .",
    "extensive shell - model calculations are performed for the @xmath4 strength , clearly showing a strong increase at low @xmath0-ray energies , in accordance with previous experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite findings in this mass region .",
    "we also investigate the impact of our results on capture cross sections and astrophysical reaction rates .",
    "more specifically , we consider the cases @xmath5sr(@xmath6)@xmath1y and @xmath5y(@xmath7)@xmath1y , as these are relevant for the @xmath10-process in this mass region , and are also of interest for reaction networks in the context of stockpile stewardship  @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : shell ] . in sec .",

    "finally , a summary and outlook can be found in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "the experiment was performed at the oslo cyclotron laboratory ( ocl ) , utilizing a proton beam of 17 mev .",
    "the beam was impinging on a natural @xmath1y target with thickness 2.25 mg/@xmath20 .",
    "the beam current was typically @xmath21 na , with about 5 days of beam time , including calibration runs on a natural si target .",
    "charged ejectiles were measured with the silicon ring ( siri ) array  @xcite , which is a @xmath22 telescope system of 8 individual telescopes , each consisting of a 130-@xmath23 m 8-fold segmented front detector ( @xmath24 ) with a @xmath25-@xmath23 m back detector ( @xmath26 ) detector ; hence , there are 64 individual silicon telescopes in the system . to reduce the amount of @xmath27 electrons from the target , a 10.5-@xmath23 m thick aluminium foil was placed in front of siri .",
    "the siri system was mounted in backward angles , covering the range @xmath28 with an angular resolution of @xmath29 .",
    "typical particle spectra from the experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : banana_matrices ] .",
    "it is seen that the charged - particle species are clearly separated from each other . in the following , we gate on the protons , i.e. we consider the @xmath1y(@xmath30)@xmath1y reaction channel .",
    "the proton - energy resolution was @xmath31 kev ( fwhm ) , determined from the ground - state peak and discrete peaks in the proton @xmath32 spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0 rays were detected with the high - efficiency nai(tl ) array cactus  @xcite .",
    "for this experiment , cactus comprised 26 cylindrical nai detectors of diameter 12.7 cm and length 12.7 cm mounted on the spherical cactus frame at angles @xmath33 , and 142.6@xmath34 with respect to the beam direction .",
    "all nai crystals are collimated with lead cones to reduce the compton contribution and enhance the peak - to - total ratio .",
    "the total efficiency for @xmath35 mev was @xmath36% .",
    "the trigger for the analog - to - digital converters of the cactus array was the signal from the thick @xmath26 detector in siri ; this was also the start signal for the time - to - digital converters of the nai detectors .    by selecting the proton channel and requiring the coincident @xmath0-rays with the protons within a time window of @xmath37 ns ,",
    "we obtain @xmath0 spectra for each excitation energy , which is found from the measured proton energy in siri corrected for the reaction kinematics .",
    "the excitation - energy versus nai signals are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_matrices]a .",
    "some pileup events are observed for @xmath38 , however , they are rare and do not contribute significantly .",
    "we also see contaminant @xmath0 lines from @xmath39c and @xmath40o , e.g. , at @xmath41 4.4 , 6.1 and 7.1 mev .",
    "these lines are kept in the data set for unfolding , and later removed as explained in the following .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra for each excitation energy bin were corrected for the cactus response functions , i.e. removing the compton , single - escape , double escape , and back - scattered annihilation events , and correcting for the full - energy efficiency .",
    "the contamination lines were also unfolded to obtain only the full - energy peaks in the final , unfolded @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "then , a 3d scan of the area around the full - energy peaks was performed to get a correct estimate of the underlying spectrum , and finally removing the carbon and oxygen lines .",
    "experimental response functions have been recorded in - beam for @xmath0 transitions of @xmath42c , @xmath40o , @xmath43si , and @xmath44fe .",
    "the unfolding procedure is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the main advantage of this method is that the original , statistical fluctuations are preserved without introducing spurious fluctuations .",
    "this is obtained by applying a strong smoothing on the compton background spectrum before subtracting it from the raw spectrum .",
    "this approach is justified by the fact that the compton background varies slowly with @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "hence , we avoid spurious structures in the final , unfolded spectrum .",
    "the experimental spin range for the present experiment can be inferred from both the singles - proton spectrum and the proton-@xmath0 coincidences . from the unfolded proton-@xmath0 coincidences ,",
    "we clearly identify transitions for states with spin / parity up to 7/2@xmath45 . from the singles - proton spectrum",
    ", we see that the 909-kev isomer with spin / parity 9/2@xmath45 is populated .",
    "this provides a lower limit for the populated spins .",
    "once the @xmath0-spectra were properly unfolded , an iterative method  @xcite was applied to obtain the distribution of primary @xmath0 transitions from secondary and higher - order transitions .",
    "the principle of this method is that for a given excitation - energy bin @xmath46 , this will contain all the @xmath0-rays of the decay cascades from lower - lying bins @xmath47 , and in addition the primary transitions for bin @xmath46 .",
    "thus , by subtracting a weighted sum of the spectra below @xmath46 , the distribution of primary @xmath0 rays for bin @xmath46 is obtained .",
    "systematic uncertainties of this procedure is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the obtained matrix of primary @xmath0-ray spectra is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_matrices]b , and the projection of the primary @xmath0 rays for @xmath48 mev is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fg_matrices](b ) .",
    "we note that the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_matrices](b ) is rather smooth , although some structures appear particularly at lower @xmath49 values .",
    "the data within the dashed lines are used for the extraction of nld and @xmath0sf in the next step .",
    "the boundaries are chosen for the following reasons : we need to make sure that the decay originates from a region of fairly high level density , and also that the primary @xmath0 spectra are indeed correct .",
    "an indicator for how well the primary-@xmath0 extraction procedure works , is calculated for each iteration and for each excitation - energy bin . in short",
    ", this indicator shows whether the primary spectrum corresponds to a @xmath0 multiplicity of 1 , which it obviously should , and in such cases the indicator is unity .",
    "we allow for a variation in this indicator of @xmath50% ; if the deviation from unity is larger , we do not use the primary spectra from that excitation - energy region ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "therefore , cuts are made in the matrices as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_matrices ] , ensuring relatively high initial excitation energies and thus high initial level density : @xmath51 mev , and @xmath52 mev for @xmath1y .",
    "the @xmath53 limit is necessary because of strong , discrete transitions being either subtracted too little or too much below this energy , resulting in vertical `` ridges '' or `` valleys '' in the primary @xmath0 matrix ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to extract the nld and the @xmath0sf from the set of primary @xmath0-ray spectra",
    ", we make use of the following relation  @xcite : @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is the experimental primary @xmath0-ray matrix as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_matrices ] , but where the primary @xmath0 spectra of each excitation - energy bin are normalized to unity to represent the probability of decay from that bin  @xcite .",
    "the matrix of primary @xmath0 spectra , @xmath55 , is proportional to the level density at the final excitation energy @xmath56 , and to the @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient @xmath57 .",
    "the latter is dependent on the @xmath0-ray energy only , in accordance with the generalized form of the brink - axel hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "the generalized brink - axel hypothesis has very recently been experimentally verified for @xmath0 transitions in the quasicontinuum  @xcite .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : brink ] ) is valid for statistical decay , i.e. where the decay is independent of the formation of the compound state  @xcite .",
    "the functional form of the nld and @xmath0sf is determined through a least-@xmath58 fit to the @xmath55 matrix as described in ref .",
