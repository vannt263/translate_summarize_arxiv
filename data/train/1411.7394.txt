    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the largest discovery machine ever built .",
    "so far only the last particle within the standard model ( sm ) , the brout - englert - higgs ( beh ) boson  @xcite , has been observed for the first time @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the outstanding performance of the lhc collaborations has allowed to set stringent limits on many different sm extensions , especially on strongly interacting particles coupling directly to the initial partons .",
    "for instance , present bounds on dijet resonances are in the 3 - 5 tev region  @xcite , bounds on quark compositeness are of the order of @xmath3 tev  @xcite and bounds on new quarks around @xmath4 gev  @xcite , respectively .",
    "similar bounds , however , apply to resonances coupling with electro - weak ( ew ) strength to quarks and leptons due to the smaller sm backgrounds when the final state is not purely hadronic and includes isolated leptons with large transverse momentum .",
    "for instance , present direct bounds for a new @xmath0 contributing to drell - yan production , @xmath5 , can be up to 3 tev for popular sm additions @xcite , as no departure from the sm prediction has been observed yet . obviously , a hadron machine with an excellent lepton reconstruction is the proper place to look for new physics ( np ) characterized by resonances coupling sizably to both , quarks and leptons , or by the corresponding four - fermion effective operators if these new particles are banished to higher energies @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if so , little room will be left by the lhc for the discovery of new mediators of the reverse process , @xmath6 , at future lepton colliders , if their center of mass energy ( cme ) is moderate , as in the case of the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    ", for which the diagnostic reach at the ilc can be in general larger than at the lhc @xcite .",
    "however , although the discriminating power between different @xmath0 additions can be better at the ilc , especially if polarized beams are available and for a higher cme , it will be a challenging task to establish the existence of a new vector boson coupling to both quarks and leptons at this machine if no signal is observed at the lhc with a high luminosity .",
    "see @xcite for a review and further references . ]    in this paper we want to address an alternative question : what can we learn at large ( hadron ) colliders about np which couples only to leptons ? or in other words , which are the prospects to discover or to exclude leptophilic interactions at the lhc and/or ilc ?",
    "the departures from the sm predictions in such a case have to be small , at least at the lhc , because the new processes must involve final leptons to which to attach the leptophilic interaction and they are produced with ew strength ( in the sm ) at a hadronic machine . in order to enhance the signal significance we may also require that it resonates in the di - lepton channel .",
    "this defines the most favorable scenario and we shall discuss it first .",
    "such a leptophilic particle must be a boson , for it couples to two fermions .",
    "moreover , assuming renormalizable coulings , the new particle must be a vector boson if the sm gauge symmetry and matter content fully describe physics below the ew scale , as the lhc data seem to indicate .",
    "indeed , a scalar multiplet transforming trivially under lepton number ( ln ) transformations can only couple to two sm lepton multiplets in a renormalizable way as does the sm scalar doublet but then , it also couples to the ew gauge bosons , and not only to leptons , as we assume .",
    "if we obviate this possibility by requiring the scalar to be a neutral singlet , we can only couple it to lepton pairs through non - renormalizable terms , which are in general effectively suppressed by small lepton masses because the corresponding lepton product must involve two multiplets with the same ( wrong ) chirality or an extra beh boson insertion .",
    "finally , if the new scalar multiplet has non - zero ln ( in fact , equal to 2 ) , it must have a doubly - charged component , coupling again to the sm gauge bosons , too ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the lowest order couplings and production mechanisms of these extra scalars ) . in summary ,",
    "the only leptophilic particle with renormalizable couplings to sm lepton pairs is a new neutral vector boson @xmath0 final states and hence , we can neglect this mixing throughout the paper when studying the leading contribution to four - lepton production mediated by a leptophilic vector boson .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion . ) ] with the following interaction lagrangian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are arbitrary dimensionless couplings to the sm left - handed ( lh ) and right - handed ( rh ) lepton multiplets , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , with @xmath11 labeling the charged - lepton family higher - spin particles do not have renormalizable couplings to lepton pairs either .    in the following",
    "we shall discuss the phenomenology of such a vector boson , leaving to the end the comments on the case where it is beyond the lhc reach and its effects are parametrized by the corresponding four - lepton operators at low energy .",
    "there are different np sources for four - lepton signals at large colliders , as , for instance , new doubly - charged scalars introduced above or heavy neutrinos decaying into three leptons , with also different production mechanisms .",
    "thus , whereas in the former case the dominant contribution results from ew pair production @xcite , in the latter it is through fermion mixing @xcite , but also mediated by gauge boson exchange . in our case the leading contribution for the production of a leptophilic vector boson at the lhc is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ zprimeproduction ] , with the @xmath0 emitted from one of the final leptons in drell - yan production .     at the lhc .",
    "[ zprimeproduction ] ]    the exchanged ew gauge boson can be also a @xmath12 if @xmath13 is sizable . as a matter of fact , in general the corresponding process with only three charged leptons in the final state plus missing energy provides the most stringent limit on a leptophilic @xmath0 .    large collider bounds on the couplings of such a vector boson are in general effectively less restrictive than indirect limits derived from precision experiments and hence , we must review the latter before going on .",
    "all processes constraining a leptophilic vector boson involve at least four leptons and two vertices , internal or not .",
    "hence , a small contribution can be the result of a small coupling squared or of one smaller coupling multiplying a larger one .",
    "this makes the large electron - positron collider ( lep ) constraints very stringent , when they apply .",
    "the @xmath0 couplings to electrons are mainly constrained by the very precise @xmath14 lep data , that very closely follows the sm prediction  @xcite , leaving no room for further improvement at the lhc : @xmath15 similar limits can be derived for @xmath16 from @xmath17 , respectively . as a matter of fact , the actual limits are slightly more stringent in this case but these bounds are already restrictive enough to make the corresponding vector boson production unobservable at the lhc , as it will be apparent from the analyses of a @xmath0 mainly coupling to muons in the next section . on the other hand , bounds on lepton flavor",
    "violating ( lfv ) muon decays like , for instance , @xmath18 at the 90 % c.l .",
    "@xcite can be fulfilled assuming the diagonal or the off - diagonal coupling to be negligible , @xmath19 or @xmath20 , in this example . in any case , however , the previous bounds are in practice restrictive enough to neglect them in the study of the lhc and ilc reach for a leptophilic @xmath0 . finally , the limit on @xmath21 at the 90 % c.l .",
    "@xcite implies @xmath22 , which can be only satisfied requiring a small enough @xmath23 because the vector boson must be reconstructed through its decays to muon pairs to be observable at the lhc and then , the diagonal muon couplings can not be too small .",
    "obviously , a proper discussion of all these limits would require to disentangle all possible products of @xmath0 couplings contributing to the different processes , also using their angular distributions , but the conclusion would be the same .",
    "hence , only the diagonal @xmath0 couplings to muons and taus can be eventually further constrained at the lhc , assuming in either case small enough couplings to electrons in order to satisfy the lep ( and eventually ilc ) limits on @xmath24 .",
    "we will denote these four coupling constants with one upper index at most , @xmath25 , from now on .",
    "as already emphasized , in order to observe a leptophilic @xmath0 at the lhc one has to sample four - lepton events , @xmath26 , as this vector boson must be emitted from a lepton , and decay afterwards into a lepton pair ( see fig .",
    "[ zprimeproduction]).s contributing to this process @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in our case",
    ", however , it is the @xmath0 itself which is emitted from the final lepton in drell - yan production , whereas the ew gauge bosons are exchanged in the @xmath27channel . in both processes the radiated vector boson has the tendency to align along the emitting lepton and hence , opposing to the other one with larger momentum , in general .",
    "] depending on the value of the coupling constants @xmath25 , @xmath28 can be a muon or a tau or one of their neutral counterparts .",
    "however , only the samples with 4@xmath29 or 3@xmath29 plus missing energy with one @xmath30 pair reconstructing the @xmath0 mass are sensitive to such a vector boson at the lhc , as we shall show . otherwise , the small branching ratios or the large irreducible backgrounds from gauge boson pair production",
    "make the signal unobservable .",
    "we shall discuss in the following how to proceed in order to characterize the new vector boson at the lhc and the ilc .",
    "the general case is fixed , as we have stressed by the @xmath0 mass , @xmath31 , its four couplings to muons and taus , @xmath25 , and its total width , @xmath32 . obviously , the latter is the sum of its partial decay rates into muons and taus ( and their associated neutrinos ) , @xmath33 and into any other channel which may be open .",
    "thus in general , @xmath34 is an extra free parameter to be determined experimentally , typically adjusting the corresponding breit - wigner distribution .",
    "as the lhc is only sensitive to the muon signals , as already pointed out and proven in next section , we will only vary @xmath31 and @xmath35 in the corresponding analyses , assuming that @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the three free parameters can be determined comparing the 4@xmath29 and 3@xmath29 samples . in order to estimate the effect of extra decay channels and",
    "hence of a larger @xmath32 , let us discuss , for illustration , the case of the only anomaly - free @xmath0 addition in this class of models @xcite , the combination of muon minus tau ln , @xmath37 , with charges",
    "@xmath38 given by @xmath39 in the narrow width approximation @xcite , which is a good prescription at the lhc ( ilc ) up to tens of per cent in the less favorable case of very large vector couplings , this model gives the same predictions for 3@xmath29 plus missing energy and 4@xmath29 production as the model with vanishing couplings to taus but with vector couplings to muons a factor of @xmath40 smaller .",
    "this reflects the fact that in this approximation the production cross - sections scale as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and this global factor of 1/2 can be absorbed in the redefinition of the strength of the @xmath0 emission from one of the final leptons in drell - yan production ( fig .",
    "[ zprimeproduction ] ) . in general",
    ", the sign of the charges does not play any role in this case because there is no interference between different final states , and no sign determination is possible either through the production processes studied here .",
    "the couplings for the different cases ( set of @xmath0 couplings ) have been included in a universal feynman rules output ( ` ufo ` ) model @xcite by means of ` feynrules ` @xcite .",
    "it can be downloaded from .",
    "a set of input parameters ( ` param cards ` ) for ` madgraph 5 ` @xcite can be also found there for all @xmath0 masses considered in the simulations along the text .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "the lhc limits for @xmath37 have been recently discussed in the literature @xcite ( see also @xcite for the analysis of a related model with leptophilic dark matter ) but concentrating on the 4@xmath29 channel , which provides the best bounds only for @xmath43 somewhat larger than @xmath44 .",
    "otherwise , the 3@xmath29 plus missing energy channel provides the most stringent limits , as suggested in @xcite and we confirm by a detailed analysis in the following . on the other hand , independent bounds from neutrino trident production also impose stringent constraints on @xmath37 and on any other @xmath0 model with a non - vanishing coupling @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they still leave room for further improvement at the lhc and the ilc .",
    "in particular , no constraint on @xmath43 is set by @xmath30 production from the scattering of the muon neutrino off the coulomb field of a nucleus .",
    "the constraints from @xmath45 are weaker but also apply to the rh muon coupling   @xcite . finally ,",
    "we focus our attention on @xmath0 masses above the @xmath46 mass , as we want to investigate the ultimate reach at large colliders .",
    "masses below @xmath47 have been considered in   @xcite .    in next section",
    "we study the lhc reach for a leptophilic @xmath0 .",
    "we derive discovery and exclusion limits as a function of its mass , @xmath31 , and its lh coupling to muons , @xmath48 , for different values of the corresponding rh coupling , @xmath49 .",
    "such a vector boson could be eventually excluded at the lhc . ] for @xmath0 masses up to @xmath50 tev and @xmath51 and @xmath52 of order one in the high - luminosity phase with an integrated luminosity @xmath53 and a cme @xmath54 tev .",
    "if a leptophilic @xmath0 below this mass is discovered , its couplings can be fully determined up to a global normalization proportional to the inverse of the square root of the total @xmath0 width , @xmath55 , which has to be measured independently from the invariant @xmath30 mass distribution reconstructing the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the codes used and the cuts applied are described in the corresponding section . the analyses to study the corresponding ilc reach are described in section [ ilc ] . in this case",
    "there is no @xmath12 exchange contribution but the 3@xmath29 plus missing energy sample is traded by the 2@xmath29 plus missing energy one , obtaining at the end bounds comparable to those derived at the lhc but only for low enough @xmath0 masses ( smaller than the ilc cme @xmath56 gev ) and for an integrated luminosity @xmath57 .",
    "however , at the ilc not only the @xmath0 total width is expected to be measurable with a better precision but in contrast with the lhc , the @xmath0 couplings to taus can be constrained analyzing the 2@xmath29 plus missing energy and 2@xmath292@xmath58 final states , too .",
    "finally , in section [ 4loperators ] we comment on the limit of very large @xmath31 and arbitrary effective four - lepton interactions .",
    "although bounds on their coefficients can be also derived from the corresponding production cross - sections , they are too weak to allow for a resonance interpretation . section [ conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions and final remarks .",
    "as argued in the introduction , current experimental constraints set stringent limits on the coupling of a leptophilic @xmath0 to electrons or to a pair of leptons of different flavor .",
    "thus the lhc can be only sensitive , a priori , to its diagonal couplings to muons and taus . as a matter of fact",
    ", only the couplings to muons can be determined at the lhc because the sm backgrounds are too large for taus to make any conclusive claim .",
    "we present in this section a detailed simulation analysis to estimate the lhc potential for discovering or excluding a new heavy neutral vector boson of mass @xmath31 coupling to the lh muon doublet with strength @xmath51 and to the rh muon singlet with strength @xmath59 .",
    "its total width reads @xmath60 where @xmath61 takes into account all decay channels different than @xmath30 and @xmath62 .",
    "the main production mechanism is the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ zprimeproduction ] with the @xmath0 radiated by one of the final muons ( neutrinos ) in drell - yan production .",
    "the production cross - section for such a ( leptophilic ) @xmath0 is relatively small and suppressed for heavy vector boson masses @xmath31 .",
    "depending on the initial parton state the exchanged ew gauge boson can be neutral ( @xmath63 ) and the final mode 4@xmath29 or 2@xmath292@xmath64 , or charged ( @xmath12 ) and the final mode 3@xmath291@xmath64 .",
    "only events with at least two muons are considered because we assume that @xmath65 in order to allow for the vector boson reconstruction , which is compulsory to enhance the signal to background ratio to an observable level . in practice",
    ", we only consider the two most promising channels : @xmath66 plus missing energy and @xmath67 .",
    "we have implemented the model in a ` ufo ` format  @xcite using ` feynrules `  @xcite .",
    "parton - level events have been generated with ` madgraph 5 `  @xcite and showered / hadronized with ` pythia 6 `  @xcite .",
    "detector effects have been simulated with ` delphes 3 `  @xcite and the experimental analyses performed by means of ` madanalysis 5 `  @xcite .",
    "jets are reconstructed with the anti-@xmath68 algorithm with @xmath69 , as implemented in ` fastjet `  @xcite .",
    "the applied cuts are collected in tables  [ 3mu_cuts : table ] and  [ 4mu_cuts : table ] for the @xmath66 plus missing energy and @xmath67 final states , respectively .",
    "the @xmath66 plus missing energy analysis closely follows the one in  @xcite , which we found to be the most constraining among the current experimental searches .",
    "still , current constraints are much weaker than the indirect ones from the neutrino trident process  @xcite and hence , we shall not report detailed results at @xmath70 tev . as an example we have run the analysis in  @xcite for a @xmath71 with mass of 140 gev and coupling @xmath72 ( at the verge of the trident exclusion bound ) .",
    "this analysis is similar to the one presented in table [ 3mu_cuts : table ] except that it does not include the last ( mass window ) cut and the numerical values of the constraints are somewhat less stringent .",
    "the current bound on the observed number of events reported in the region named `` srnozc '' in  @xcite ( the most sensitive to our signal ) is 6.8 whereas we obtain that only 1.5 of our signal events pass those cuts .",
    "a simple modification of the experimental analysis requiring only muons in the final state ( as opposed to muons and electrons ) and including the last ( mass window ) cut would reduce the background to an almost negligible level but also our signal which would be too small to provide a significant limit .",
    "the situation is even worse in the 4@xmath29 channel in which the cross sections are even smaller .",
    "nevertheless , we have used the @xmath66 plus missing energy analysis to validate our generator implementation , finding good agreement . in all simulations",
    "we have only considered the irreducible backgrounds , which are by far the most relevant ones , unless otherwise stated , renormalizing our results with a global factor to account for non - irreducible ones as well as for higher - order effects . in order to be conservative ,",
    "this factor is applied to the estimation of the background but not to the signal .",
    "finally , an important observation is that it would be extremely useful that the experimental collaborations present their results separately for electrons and muons as only the latter contribute to our signal .",
    ".cuts for @xmath66 plus missing energy events .",
    "the transverse mass is computed with the transverse missing energy and the lepton not belonging to the pair which better reconstructs the @xmath0 boson mass .",
    "only isolated muons are considered .",
    "[ 3mu_cuts : table ] [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     that this set is complete can be shown using the fierz relation @xmath73 to reduce the four combinations of four sm lepton multiplets which are lorentz and gauge invariant : @xmath74 to three .",
    "these operators are also invariant under the exchange of the pairs of flavor indices @xmath75 and under the permutation of the two flavor indices @xmath76 and therefore , under the permutation of the other two flavor indices @xmath77 . what reduces the independent four - lepton operators @xmath78 to the set in table [ mutaufourleptonoperators ] if we also require flavor - parity conservation .",
    "lepton number conservation follows from gauge invariance at this order .",
    "then , any np coupling to muons and taus and heavy enough to evade direct observation at the lhc can be parametrized by a combination of the operators in this table .",
    "we estimate the corresponding lhc and ilc reach assuming that only one of them has a non - vanishing coefficient at a time .",
    "the most stringent bounds are obtained for the four - muon operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 . using the same generation procedure as for @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ zprimeintegration ] ) and applying the same cuts as in table [ table : cutsoperators ] ( and in tables  [ 3mu_cuts : table ] and [ 4mu_cuts : table ] except for the mass window cut ) to the 3@xmath29 plus missing energy and 4@xmath29 samples , respectively , we obtain the @xmath82 c.l .",
    "limits at the lhc  , with no additional global sign . ] : @xmath83 and at the ilc : @xmath84 values which are similar to those derived for the heavy @xmath85 effective lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ zprimeintegration ] ) , as similar are the applicable comments .    if the leptophilic effective operators are allowed to involve electrons , too , there are 19 more independent four - lepton operators and an estimate of present bounds is reviewed in the introduction .",
    "the outstanding performance of the lhc experiments makes them not only discovery but also precision devices . with this in mind",
    "it is natural to question whether the ilc is really a complementary machine , especially if no signal of np is established at the lhc . at any rate ,",
    "the energy frontier is the domain of hadron machines , as are the strong interactions , and at the end of the day even the ew gauge interactions , too . in general only the eventually huge backgrounds set the limits of the lhc potential .",
    "hence , an obvious question which we have addressed in this paper is if np only coupling to leptons and naturally accessible to the ilc is constrained at all by a large hadron collider .",
    "the only lowest order interaction fulfilling these conditions is a new leptophilic neutral vector boson .",
    "we have explored this sm addition allowing for general couplings to muons and taus ( and to their neutral counterparts ) .",
    "couplings to electrons can be neglected because the corresponding lep limits make the lhc insensitive to them , as lfv bounds make the lhc insensitive to leptophilic off - diagonal couplings . as a matter of fact , lhc experiments are only sensitive to the @xmath0 couplings to muons because couplings to taus can not be measured efficiently due to their larger backgrounds .",
    "the lhc reach for a leptophilic @xmath0 coupling to muons can be up to @xmath86 1 tev for coupling constants of order one . moreover , the comparison of the 3@xmath29 plus missing energy and 4@xmath29 final states allows to determine the ratio of the rh singlet to the lh doublet muon couplings . in order to also determine the global normalization ,",
    "the @xmath0 total width must be independently measured , which is not easy at the lhc ( see fig .",
    "[ lhczprimewidth ] ) .",
    "the corresponding determination of these couplings at the ilc relies on the 4@xmath29 , 2@xmath29 plus missing energy and 2@xmath292@xmath58 samples ( in the second and third sets two subsamples can be distinguished depending on whether the @xmath0 decays into @xmath30 or @xmath87 or into @xmath30 or @xmath88 , respectively ) , since the initial state is neutral and no @xmath12 can be exchanged in the @xmath89-channel .",
    "the bounds which may be eventually derived are similar to the lhc ones , but only for light enough vector boson masses ( @xmath90 gev ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0 couplings to taus can be only determined at the ilc in either case .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the ilc is very much dependent not only on how low the new vector boson mass is but also on the relative size of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , because the former must be sizable for reconstructing the @xmath0 and the latter for producing a large enough signal to measure the tau couplings .",
    "this appreciably reduces the accessible parameter space at the ilc .    in summary ,",
    "the only departure from the sm eventually observable at the lhc , if a new leptophilic vector boson exists , is a moderate excess of events in the 3@xmath29 plus missing energy and 4@xmath29 samples with a @xmath30 pair peaking around the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the typical cross - section after preselection cuts being of few fb . on the other hand",
    ", the ilc can only confirm the observation of such a vector boson .",
    "although for a rather light @xmath0 also coupling sizably to taus , an analysis of the 2@xmath29 plus missing energy and 2@xmath292@xmath58 samples could also allow for the measurement of the @xmath0 couplings to taus .",
    "if this leptophilic vector boson would also couple to electrons , the leptonic processes @xmath93 would offer the best place to look for such a new interaction @xcite .    we have also discussed the limit of a @xmath0 with a mass beyond the lhc reach , that can be parametrized by the corresponding four - lepton operators .",
    "limits on the independent invariant ( dimension 6 ) operators involving four sm lepton multiplets can be estimated in a similar way , but the corresponding bounds on their coefficients , @xmath94 tev@xmath95 , are too weak to allow for a weakly coupled resonance interpretation .",

    "<S> leptophilic interactions can only be observed at the lhc in four - lepton final states . </S>",
    "<S> if these interactions are mediated by a resonance in the di - leptonic channel with renormalizable couplings , the mediator must have spin 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we study the lhc reach for such a vector boson allowing for arbitrary couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we find that only couplings to muons can be probed at the lhc because lepton flavor violating couplings are constrained by rare processes , couplings to electrons by lep and the lhc is not sensitive to final states involving taus in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the ilc becomes then complementary to the lhc as it will provide the best limits on @xmath0 couplings to tau leptons . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent example is the case of the anomaly - free @xmath0 coupling to the muon minus tau lepton number @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> if no departure from the standard model is observed at the lhc , the most stringent bounds on this vector boson are provided from events with only three charged leptons plus missing energy . </S>",
    "<S> masses of the order of 1 tev can be probed at the high - luminosity phase of the lhc for @xmath2 couplings of order one . </S>",
    "<S> generic four - lepton operators parametrizing leptophilic interactions can be also constrained using three and four ( or two at the ilc ) charged - lepton samples , but the corresponding limits are marginal , if meaningful , because the resonant behavior appears to be essential for the signal to be significant .    </S>",
