    "among the various types of superconducting qubits  @xcite , the recently developed fluxonium qubit  @xcite has the unique advantage of being protected against both charge and flux noise .",
    "this is important since both effects in general limit the performance of the qubits by introducing relaxation and dephasing processes .",
    "indeed , over the last few years considerable effort has been made in order to understand , and consequently to reduce , the causes of relaxation and decoherence in different types of superconducting circuits  @xcite .",
    "initially , the fluxonium qubit has been designed in order to reduce the sensitivity of the cooper pair box to charge noise @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it has been argued that it is also insensitive to flux noise @xcite . in order to reach a regime in which these relaxation and decoherence processes are exponentially suppressed ,",
    "the charging energy @xmath0 , with the capacitance @xmath1 and the elementary charge @xmath2 , has to be much larger than the inductive scale @xmath3 , with the inductance @xmath4 and the fine - structure constant @xmath5 . while it is impossible to realize such large  superinductances \" ,",
    "@xmath6 , with conventional media , in the fluxonium qubit it has been realized by an array of ( large ) josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "a downside of this approach is that the device is then potentially plagued by spurious phase slips through the array ; however , these have been successfully eliminated @xcite . recently , different detrimental effects in the fluxonium qubit due to non - equilibrium quasiparticles have been addressed theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "of all the processes limiting the performance of the qubits discussed above quasiparticle tunneling is particularly important as it is _ intrinsic _ to the superconducting tunneling junction and as such forms an absolute limit .",
    "while relaxation and dephasing mechanisms due to quasiparticle tunneling have been extensively studied in charge qubits @xcite , for the flux qubits most studies so far have concentrated on the relaxation due to quasiparticle processes @xcite . on the other hand , first investigations of the dephasing due to quasiparticle tunneling on a perturbative level in the junction transmission",
    "have been put forward in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that treating the problem in perturbation theory leads to a diverging result due to the sharp peak of the quasiparticle density of states at the gap .",
    "this problem has been addressed by introducing as a cutoff a relaxation rate @xcite or a dephasing rate @xcite that broaden the density of states , where the latter has been determined self - consistently .",
    "it has been discussed that in principle the divergence is lifted by treating the tunneling nonperturbatively as the divergence simply signals the presence of a weakly bound andreev state close to the gap @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been recognised that the presence of different nonequilibrium quasiparticle distributions on the different superconducting islands of the qubit ( possibly accidentally arising during operation of the qubit  @xcite and resulting in an effective _ temperature gradient _ of stationary nonequilibrium quasiparticle distributions ) can lead to an additional decoherence mechanism for the flux qubits , see reference @xcite , where in particular the flux qubit in the delft - qubit design has been addressed .",
    "it has been shown that in this case a limitation of the dephasing time arises caused by heat currents carried by quasiparticles which flow through the josephson junctions of a superconducting qubit as a response to the ( effective ) temperature gradient .",
    "the microscopic origin of this dephasing mechanism is the fact that a heat current flowing through a josephson junction depends on the phase difference of the two superconductors separated by the junction .",
    "this fundamental effect has been predicted over 50 years ago , see @xcite , and has later been studied in more detail in references @xcite .",
    "only very recently , the phase dependence of heat currents through josephson junctions has been measured experimentally @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , due to the general phase - dependence of the heat current , heat currents flowing across junctions of superconducting flux qubits can depend on the qubit state .",
    "this results in the dephasing of the qubits , since heat currents are dissipative @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate pure dephasing of the fluxonium qubit due to a non - equilibrium quasiparticle distribution .",
    "we in particular analyze the relevance of this intrinsic dephasing mechanism ( without population relaxation ) slightly away from the sweet spot , where it would be suppressed , see @xcite .",
    "we model the non - equilibrium distribution of quasiparticles by an effective temperature which is different on different superconducting segments of the qubit .",
    "we study in details the effect of the heat current flowing both through the josephson junction of the so - called _ black - sheep _ junction with josephson energy @xmath7 , which is the main source of nonlinearity , as well as through the array of larger junctions constituting the superinductance , which is shunting the _ black sheep_. in particular , we are interested in the linear response regime where the difference in temperatures is small .",
    "we show that the sensitivity of the fluxonium qubit to heat transport and the resulting pure dephasing is suppressed by a factor @xmath8 ( up to logarithmic corrections ) rendering the fluxonium qubit rather insensitive to this dephasing source .",
    "we point out that even if the effective temperature gradient is vanishingly small , the study of the heat conductance ( rather than of the heat currents ) is relevant : intriguingly , it can be used as a phenomenological approach for the investigation of dephasing due to nonequilibrium quasiparticles .",
    "different from our phenomenological approach , prior work on dephasing in flux - based qubits @xcite was based on a microscopic model .",
    "our approach has the advantage that we are able to consider very small temperature gradients  corresponding to superconducting qubit segments with identical superconducting gaps . in this regime ,",
    "the dominating effect of the heat - current sensitivity to the qubit state stems from the phase - dependence of a weak bound state originating from andreev reflection . due to the fact that our approach is _ nonperturbative _ in the tunnelling coupling , we are not plagued by divergencies as the weak andreev bound state acts as a natural phase - dependent cut - off",
    "additionally , our approach provides a nice link of this intrinsic dephasing mechanism to thermal transport quantities and their ability to  measure \" a qubit state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ fluxonium ] , we introduce the generic hamiltonian of the fluxonium qubit .",
    "we recall the results for heat currents flowing through a single josephson junctions for very small temperature gradients in section  [ heatcurrent ] .",
    "these findings are then used in section  [ fluxonium_heat ] to investigate on the sensitivity of the heat current on the fluxonium states . in section  [ sec_dephasing ] , we show in how far the resulting dephasing can limit the operation of the fluxonium qubit .",
    "the fluxonium is a superconducting qubit which can be thought of as a cooper - pair box inductively shunted with a superinductance @xcite .",
    "its electrical circuit is shown in figure  [ fig : fluxonium](a ) : it consists of a josephson junction , which we refer to as the _ black sheep _ , with josephson energy @xmath7 and charging energy @xmath9 .",
    "this josephson junction is shunted by an array of @xmath10 larger josephson junctions ( with josephson coupling energy @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) . when operated at microwave frequencies well below its self - resonant frequency @xmath13",
    ", this array emulates a ` superinductance ' for sufficiently large @xmath10 .",
    "it is the presence of this superinductance which renders the fluxonium insensitive to charge noise while yielding a highly anharmonic spectrum , both important points for the realisation of a qubit .",
    "josephson junctions , which is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath14 .",
    "the _ black sheep _",
    "junction has a josephson energy @xmath7 and a phase difference @xmath15 ; the remaining @xmath10 junctions with a larger josephson energy @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) act as a superinductance .",
    "we consider the situation where the two electrodes separated by the _ black sheep _ are biased by a small temperature difference .",

    "the wave functions of the three lowest lying eigenstates ( @xmath20 ) are depicted by red , orange and green lines , where the vertical offset indicates the corresponding eigenenergy . ]",
    "the hamiltonian of the fluxonium consists of different parts , stemming from the charging and the josephson energy of the different junctions  @xcite . charging effects on the _ black sheep _ junction lead to the charging energy @xmath21 with @xmath22 the number of cooper pairs on the capacitance plate of the _ black sheep_. in the hamiltonian , the charging energy of the _ black sheep _ serves as the kinetic energy , while the sum of the different josephson energies takes the role of the potential energy .",
    "in particular , the potential energy of the _ black sheep _ is given by @xmath23 with @xmath15 the superconducting phase difference across the _ black - sheep _ junction which is the conjugate variable to @xmath24 . for simplicity , we assume the junctions in the array constituting the superinductance to be equal with a somewhat larger josephson energy @xmath11 , @xmath16 .",
    "the total potential energy is thus given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 the phase difference across each of the junctions constituting the superinductance .",
    "we neglect the capacitive energies of the m array junctions since their larger area translates into smaller charging effects .",
    "the radius @xmath27 of the superconducting loop is supposed to be so small that the inductive energy @xmath28 per flux quantum @xmath29 dominates the josephson energies @xmath7 . in this regime ,",
    "the magnetic flux in the superconducting loop is quantized which leads to the condition @xmath30 with the dimensionless parameter @xmath31 due to the magnetic flux @xmath32 accounting for the external magnetic field penetrating the loop . using this relation",
    ", we can express the hamiltonian in terms of one dynamical variable , only , which we choose to be the total phase difference across the superinductance , @xmath33 .",
    "note that at fixed @xmath17 , the phase difference @xmath26 across each junction in the array constituting the superinductance becomes small for large @xmath10 . as a result of the small phase difference across each of the large junctions",
    ", we are allowed to expand the cosine in the potential energy to second order in @xmath26 with the result @xmath34 ( up to an irrelevant constant shift ) . here",
    ", we have introduced the inductive energy of the superinductance @xmath35 with the effective inductance @xmath36 , which increases linearly with @xmath10 .",
    "it is the inductive term , which we obtained from expanding the cosine potential of the array to second order in @xmath26 , which breaks the @xmath37 periodicity of the total potential @xmath38 as a function of @xmath17 , thus rendering the device charge insensitive @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath39 of the fluxonium is given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 the operator conjugate to @xmath17 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for @xmath42 may serve as a model - hamiltonian for different qubit types @xcite . in the present manuscript",
    ", we mainly discuss the fluxonium qubit which is realized in the regime @xmath43 , where the latter inequality is made possible by the presence of the superinductance .",
    "we compare the result to the case of the delft qubit realized in the regime @xmath44 ; see table  [ table ] for a discussion of the different energy scales .    .",
    "[ table ] characteristic energy ratios for the fluxonium @xcite and delft qubit @xcite when described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for the dynamic degree of freedom .",
    "the ratio @xmath45 approximately corresponds to the number of levels in a potential minimum , whereas @xmath46 is a measure of the number of mimima of the potential which typically contribute to the qubit states @xcite . [",

    "for the fluxonium qubit , we find numerically that the potential landscape features two well - localized minima for @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the two minima are situated at @xmath50 .",
    "the two lowest - lying states in these minima , representing the qubit states , correspond to a current flowing clockwise / counter - clockwise in the device .",
    "however , due to the large inductance the corresponding currents are rather small , even though the two states differ by a large magnetic flux .    the dephasing mechanism which we investigate in the following arises due to the fact that the different semiclassical states correspond to different superconducting phases on the islands which in turn makes the phase - dependent heat currents through the junctions dependent on the qubit state .",
    "the resulting decoherence thus projects the qubit on the semiclassical states @xmath50 .",

    "the spread @xmath63 of the wavefunction is given by @xmath64 .",

    "in the following , we want to study the effect of a small ( effective ) temperature gradient on the quantum information encoded in the fluxonium . to this end , we need to calculate the resulting heat current flowing through the junctions interrupting the superconducting loop of the fluxonium qubit .",
    "we are interested in the effect of accidental ( effective ) temperature differences ; this means that we need to calculate heat currents in response to small temperature differences @xmath66 , that is @xmath67 .",

    "that , due to the specific derivation that we chose for these parameters ( see [ app : weak ] ) , differences in the functional form of these coefficients occur with respect to the ones given in reference  @xcite . for small temperatures compared to the critical one @xmath85",
    ", we observe that @xmath86 , i.e. , they are exponentially suppressed at low temperatures .",
    "we now proceed to investigate how the phase sensitivity of the heat current through a josephson junction manifests itself in the fluxonium .",
    "the situation we have in mind is some stationary nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution on the fluxonium qubit .",
    "as mentioned above , we model this distribution by an effective temperature , in order to keep the discussion simple .",
    "term in equations  [ kappalinearregime ] to [ ks ] ) by arbitrary distribution functions . ] in particular , we treat the situation where one side of the josephson junction is at an elevated temperature @xmath75 with respect to the other which is at temperature @xmath74 , see figure  [ fig : fluxonium](a ) . as a result quasiparticles tunnel from the `` hot '' to the cold reservoir . as seen in the last section , the resulting heat current depends on the superconducting phase differences and thus on the state of the qubit .",
    "as we have assumed the @xmath10 josephson junctions of the array emulating the superinductance to be equivalent , the temperature gradient is distributed among the @xmath10 elements with the temperature difference @xmath87 on a single junction .",
    "the heat current @xmath88 flowing into the cold reservoir , which is held at temperature @xmath74 ( or equivalently in the heat current flowing out of the hot reservoir , kept at temperature @xmath89  ) is given by the sum of two terms @xmath90 where the first term is the contribution of the _ black sheep _ and the second term is due to the large josephson junction connecting the array of the superinductance to the cold reservoir .",
    "the decoherence of the fluxonium qubit is triggered by the difference @xmath91 of the heat currents flowing in the device when the qubit is in the state r / l with @xmath92 .",
    "following our previous work , @xcite , we introduce the sensitivity @xmath93 as a measure of correlation between the heat current and the qubit state . as a large sensitivity corresponds to a large difference of heat currents for different qubit states",
    ", we expect that this in turn leads to fast dephasing of the qubit ; an expectation which we confirm below .",
    "however , in a first step , we want to calculate the sensitivity for the fluxonium .      in this section , we show that the sensitivity of the heat currents to the fluxonium state only depends on the effective parameters @xmath94 and @xmath7 of the hamiltonian , given in equation  [ hamiltonian ] , and not on the specific number @xmath10 of junctions ( or their asymmetry factor @xmath95 ) with which the superinductance @xmath36 is emulated . in order to realise a fluxonium qubit modelled by the hamiltonian given in equation  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ,",
    "a large amount @xmath10 of array junctions is needed , which all have a josephson energy larger than the one of the _ black sheep _ by a factor @xmath96 . in view of equation ( [ el ] ) , to obtain a given value of @xmath94 , the coupling strength of each array junction needs to scale like @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that from the two terms in equation  ( [ eq_totalheat ] ) , only the one stemming from the junction of the array forming the superinductance , @xmath98 , could possibly depend on @xmath10 .",
    "the variables occurring in the argument of the heat current depend on @xmath10 via @xmath99 and @xmath100 . exploiting equations  ( [ zhao ] ) and ( [ ks ] )",
    ", we find that for large @xmath10 , where @xmath101 , the only relevant term for @xmath102 is given by the phase - independent part of the thermal conductance of the array junction , which we denote by @xmath103 . as a consequence ,",
    "the state - dependent heat current difference @xmath104 depends only on the heat current through the black sheep . hence in the following only the dependence on @xmath10 of the term @xmath103 entering the denominator of the sensitivity has to be investigated .",
    "the thermal conductance @xmath105 is proportional to @xmath106 , the normal - state resistance of the outer junction of the array .",
    "now , due to the generalised ambegaokar - baratoff relations  @xcite , the normal - state resistance is inversely proportional to the josephson energy of the corresponding junction and we thus find @xmath107 , with @xmath108 the phase - independent contribution to the thermal conductance of the _ black sheep_. therefore , @xmath109 is independent of @xmath10 , due to the cancellation of the factors @xmath10 and @xmath95 occuring in @xmath105 and @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath111 , the heat current through the superinductance is negligible compared to the one through the _ black sheep _",
    ", which is proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "we therefore completely neglect the heat current through the superinductance in the following .       for @xmath113 and @xmath114 . the full result of equation  ( [ s ] ) ( full blue line )",
    "is compared to its approximation for @xmath115 of equation  ( [ eqsensitivity3 ] ) ( red dashed line ) . ]",
    "having found that the sensitivity is independent of the specific realization of the superinductance , we here present an analytical expression for the sensitivity @xmath116 in the regime @xmath117 and @xmath56 , which is relevant for the fluxonium qubit .",
    "we have seen in section [ qubit_states ] that @xmath118 and @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "evaluating @xmath116 of equation [ s ] to first order in @xmath121 and leading order in @xmath122 yields the final result @xmath123 this expression shows that the sensitivity depends quadratically on the ratio @xmath122 with logarithmic corrections .",
    "thus , the heat current in the fluxonium qubit is less sensitive to the qubit state than it is the case for the delft qubit , due to the smaller ratio @xmath122 .",
    "this comparison can be easily performed , since a description of both qubits is possible following equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , with the effective qubit parameters given in table [ table ] . in what follows ,",
    "we show that the fluxonium qubit therefore enjoys an increased protection with respect to quasiparticle processes as compared to the delft qubit . in figure",
    "[ sensitivityapprox ] , we have plotted the approximate result of the sensitivity of equation [ eqsensitivity3 ] exhibiting a quadratic dependence for small @xmath122 ; a comparison to the exact expression [ s ] indicates that the approximation is valid for @xmath124 .",
    "in a recent work @xcite , we have demonstrated that the sensitivity of the heat current in a flux qubit ( in the delft qubit design ) leads to a dephasing of the qubit .",
    "the reason for this dephasing is the fact that for non - zero sensitivities the tunnelling probabilities of quasiparticles depends on the state of the qubit ; hence quasiparticles which tunnel through the josephson junction , can dephase the qubit .",
    "importantly , the heat current incorporates both the phase - dependent quasiparticle transmission probabilities through the junction as well as the quasiparticle distribution functions .",
    "this forms the basis for our argument that the heat current captures the relevant properties leading to qubit dephasing due to quasiparticle tunneling .",
    "we therefore propose to investigate this transport property , in order to access quasiparticle dephasing on a phenomenological level .",
    "we gain additional confidence in our results for the qubit dephasing obtained from this phenomenological approach by noticing that in the regime of large temperatures ( where the cut - off due to the andreev bound state becomes unimportant ) our approach reproduces the perturbative results from the microscopic model @xcite .    following reference  @xcite ,",
    "see also [ app : der ] , we can derive the expression @xmath125 for the inverse dephasing time , valid to lowest order @xmath122 and @xmath121 ; here , @xmath126 is the bound state energy at the phase difference @xmath127 at @xmath128 .",
    "note that at the sweet spot the heat currents are equivalent for the two qubit states which results in the vanishing of the dephasing rate , up to exponentially small corrections in @xmath129 , which are not considered in this paper .",
    "owing to our phenomenological approach , the dephasing time can be directly brought into contact with the sensitivity of the heat currents flowing in the device to the qubit state . in order to estimate this link",
    ", we consider the low temperature regime , @xmath130 , and write down the product between dephasing time and the difference in heat currents in the two qubit states , @xmath131 .",
    "this function gives us an idea about the energy which is transferred by the _ difference _ of heat currents in the two qubit states in the time , which the qubit needs to dephase .",
    "it turns out that to lowest order in @xmath122 and @xmath121 , we obtain the simple result @xmath132 the full expressions are presented in [ app : link ] .",
    "equation [ 3 ] shows that the value of @xmath133 only depends on the detuning @xmath121 from the sweet spot and is otherwise independent of any of the qubit parameters .",
    "the additional parameters @xmath134 entering the expression describe the heat current due to the flow of the quasiparticles .",
    "starting from equation [ 3 ] , we only need to find @xmath135 in order to obtain the dephasing time @xmath136 that limits the performance of the superconducting qubit . in the limit @xmath121 small",
    ", the two states @xmath137 and @xmath138 have a similar heat current with @xmath139 , such that we obtain the expression @xmath140 .",
    "additionally , in the limit @xmath141 , @xmath127 is close to @xmath142 and thus @xmath143 which leads to the final result @xmath144 we see that as expected the dephasing time is inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the heat current that is flowing through the structure to the state of the qubit . as we have seen before",
    ", @xmath116 is proportional to @xmath145 ( up to logarithmic corrections ) ; consequently the fluxonium qubit has the benefit of a larger dephasing time than the delft qubit .",
    "different from the dephasing caused by charge and flux noise , the inverse dephasing time due to the transport of quasiparticles is not exponentially suppressed in the fluxonium regime @xmath56 .",
    "however , due to the fact that @xmath146 , an exponential improvement of the dephasing time limited by quasiparticle tunneling can be reached by lowering the _",
    "temperature_. this is expected since it corresponds to decreasing the quasiparticle occupation .    , multiplied by the level splitting of the fluxonium @xmath147 and by @xmath121 as a function of temperature ( full blue line ) .",
    "the transmission of the junction is assumed to be @xmath113 , @xmath148 and the number of channels contributing to transport @xmath149 .",
    "the red dashed line shows a fit @xmath150 with @xmath151 . ]    in order to make a quantitive statement relevant for applications , it is useful to introduce the dimensionless number @xmath152 with @xmath153 the level splitting of the qubit , rather than looking at the dephasing time only . in particular , since the inverse level splitting , @xmath154 , yields a measure of the time of a qubit operation , the parameter @xmath152 indicates the typical number of single qubit gates which can be performed before coherence is lost .",
    "we numerically determine the level splitting from the difference of the energies of the ground and excited state from the hamiltonian given in equation  [ hamiltonian ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig_dephbohrdf ] , we show a plot of the function @xmath155 .",
    "since with small changes in @xmath156 , the level splitting increases linearly with @xmath121 , while @xmath136 is proportional to @xmath157 , we choose to multiply the parameter of interest with @xmath121 in order to get a function which is essentially independent of @xmath121 .",
    "figure  [ fig_dephbohrdf ] shows a logarithmic plot of @xmath155 for small values of the temperature , @xmath158 .",
    "the ratio between the two time - scales , @xmath136 and @xmath159 , occurs to be approximately exponentially suppressed with increasing temperature .",
    "this can be seen by using equations [ eqsensitivity3 ] and [ 5 ] , where we see that @xmath160 . moreover , from the definitions of @xmath161 given in equation [ ks ] , for small temperatures we have @xmath162 .",
    "finally , figure [ fig_dephbohrdf ] shows that for small values of the temperature it is possible to perform a great number of operations on the qubit state before they become unreliable due to dephasing of the two - level system .",
    "for example for @xmath163 and @xmath164 , we have that @xmath165 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the impact of the phase sensitivity of the quasiparticle transport on the coherence properties of the fluxonium qubit . using a phenomenological approach , based on the study of heat currents carried by quasiparticles and the associated heat conductance",
    ", we have shown that the dephasing time is inversely proportional to the sensitivity , a quantity describing to which extent possible heat currents flowing in the device depend on the state of the qubit .",
    "we have shown that the sensitivity of the heat current to the qubit state depends quadratically on the ratio @xmath122 of the characteristic energies of the fluxonium qubit but not on the number of junctions with which the superinductance , a relevant ingredient of the fluxonium qubit , is realised .",
    "the independence of the number of array - junctions can qualitatively be traced back to the fact that , at small temperature gradients , the heat current in the arms of the loop constituting the fluxonium qubit is mainly given by the heat current in the so - called _ black sheep _ junction , which does not depend on @xmath10 . the fact that the sensitivity can be reduced by lowering the ratio @xmath122 has the important result that the fluxonium qubit is less affected by dephasing due to quasiparticle tunnelling through the josephson junction when compared to the delft qubit design .",
    "we furthermore find that the dephasing mechanism is exponentially suppressed with temperature due to its origin in quasiparticle tunneling .",
    "however , we have shown that at moderately low temperatures the resulting dephasing time is demonstrated to be large enough to easily allow an excess of @xmath166 operations before the qubit dephases .",

    ", we outline the procedure , which we apply to obtain the coefficients given in equation  [ ks ] .    as a starting point , it is useful to evaluate the logarithmic divergence occuring in the linear response coefficient shown in equation  [ coeff_full ] .",
    "since the divergence stems from values of @xmath169 in the vicinity of the superconducting gap @xmath170 , this logarithmic divergence can conveniently be extracted by setting @xmath171 in all contributions of equation  [ coeff_full ] with a smooth dependence on @xmath169 in the vicinity of @xmath170 .",
