    "the hadronic decays of b meson are important for particle physics since they provide constraints of the standard model cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , a test of the qcd factorization , information on the decay mechanism , and the final state interaction .",
    "the cp asymmetries , in which some of the hadronic uncertainties are canceled in their theoretical predictions , play an important role in the investigations of b physics . for the decays with a single d meson in the final states , only tree operators contribute , and thus no cp asymmetry appears in the standard model @xcite .",
    "however , for decays with double - charm final states , there are penguin operator contributions as well as tree operator contributions",
    ". thus the direct cp asymmetry may be present .",
    "recently , the belle collaboration reported a large direct cp violation in @xmath6 decay  @xcite , while babar reproted a small one , with a different sign even  @xcite .",
    "what is more , large direct cp asymmetries have not been observed in other @xmath7 decays  @xcite either , which have the same flavor structures as @xmath8 at the quark level .",
    "intrigued by these experimental results , many investigations on the decays of b to double - charm states have been carried out@xcite .",
    "the theoretical study of hadronic b decays has achieved great success in recent years . among them ,",
    "the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) is based on @xmath9 factorization @xcite . by keeping the transverse momentum of quarks ,",
    "the end point singularity in the collinear factorization has been eliminated .",
    "since transverse momentum introduces another energy scale , double logarithm appears in the qcd radiative corrections .",
    "the renormalization group equation is used to resum the double logarithm , which results in the sudakov factor .",
    "this factor effectively suppresses the endpoint contribution of the distribution amplitude of mesons in the small transverse momentum region , which makes the perturbative calculation reliable .",
    "phenomenologically , the pqcd approach successfully predict the following : ( 1)the direct cp asymmetry in b decays @xcite , ( 2)the pure annihilation type b decays @xcite ( 3 ) the strong final state interaction phase and color suppressed decay amplitude in the @xmath10 decays @xcite",
    ".    in charmless two - body b decays , the final state mesons can be considered as massless therefore both of the final state mesons are on the light cone .",
    "the collinear factorization can be easily proved in the heavy quark limit . for the decays with a single heavy d meson in the final states ,",
    "one can still prove factorization @xcite in the leading order of the @xmath11 expansion .",
    "for the decays with double - charm quarks in the final states , such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , it is believed that the factorization fails .",
    "however the decays with double d mesons in the final states are different .",
    "the reason is that the expansion parameter @xmath14 could be considered small , @xmath15 is not . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are soft particles in b decays ; while the @xmath18 meson is collinear in the @xmath19 decays .",
    "the momentum of the @xmath18 meson in the latter decays is @xmath20 , which is still nearly half of the b meson mass .",
    "the decays of b to double - charm states can be investigated in the pqcd approach in the leading order of @xmath11 and @xmath2 expansion .",
    "all of the annihilation type diagrams contain end - point sigualrity , which are quite different from the spectatorlike diagrams which are dominated by the form factors .",
    "it is very difficult to deal with in the collinear factorization .",
    "the pqcd base on @xmath9 factorization is almost the only approach that can give quantitative calculations of annihilation type decays .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic ] , we list the formalism , including the hamiltonian , the wave functions of the mesons , the factorization formulae of the feynman diagrams for @xmath21 decay mode , and the analytic expressions for the decay amplitudes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , the numerical results of the physical observables and discussions of the results are given .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is a brief summary .",
    "the common pqcd functions , scales , and the factorization formulae of the feynman diagrams for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 modes are all put into the appendices for simplicity .",
    "in hadronic b decays there are several typical energy scales , and expansions with respect to the ratios of the scales are usually carried out .",
    "the physics with a scale higher than the w boson mass are electroweak interactions , which can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the physics between the w boson mass and b quark mass obtain qcd corrections .",
    "this correction is included in the wilson coefficients of the four - quark operators in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the physics below the b quark mass is more complicated .",
    "we have to utilize the factorization theorem to factorize the nonperturbative contributions out , so that the hard part can be calculated perturbatively . in the pqcd approach ,",
    "we utilize the @xmath9 factorization @xcite , where the transverse momenta of the quarks in the mesons are kept to eliminate the end - point sigularity . because of the new transverse momentum scale introduction ,",
    "double logarithms appear in the calculation .",
    "we resum these logarithms to give a sudakov factor , which effectively suppresses the end - point region contribution .",
    "thus the end - point sigularity in the usual collinear factorization disappears .",
    "this makes the perturbative calculation reliable and consistent . for decays with d meson in the final states ,",
    "another scale @xmath25 is introduced .",
    "the factorization is proved in the leading order of the @xmath1 expansion @xcite , therefore , as it is done in the computation of @xmath26 and @xmath27 amplitudes@xcite , we will work in the leading order @xmath1 expansion .",
    "for each of the diagrams in the following , we keep the contributions in the leading order of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , in the @xmath3 meson to two vector mesons decays , the leading order contributions of some transversely polarized amplitudes are proportional to @xmath28 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "then we will keep the @xmath28 terms in these diagrams .",
    "while in other cases , the terms of @xmath28 are neglected because the leading order is lower than @xmath29 .",

    "because the p wave contributions are very small in the color allowed tree dominated processes , the experimental measurements are still in agreement with our calculations .",
