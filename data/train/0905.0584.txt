    "low - mass x - ray binaries containing accreting weakly magnetised neutron stars exhibit luminosity and spectral variations on time scale of hours to days and are usually divided into two classes : z and atoll sources @xcite .",
    "this classification relies upon the path traced out by individual sources in the x - ray colour - colour diagram ( cd ) or hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) .",
    "cd is constructed by plotting the hard colours ( ratio of count rates in two largest energy bands ) against soft colours ( ratio of count rates in two lowest energy bands ) .",
    "hid is constructed by plotting hard colour against intensity .",
    "z - sources trace out an approximate ` z ' shaped path in the cd and hid with the three branches named as the horizontal branch ( hb ) , the normal branch ( nb ) and the flaring branch ( fb ) . spectral analysis of uv data which is modelled as reproduced x - ray emission from an outer disk , indicates that the bolometric luminosity and hence the mass accretion rate increases along the z - track from hb to fb through nb @xcite .",
    "however , more direct estimation of the bolometric luminosity has proved to be difficult since that requires both broad band data and a reliable distance estimate . nevertheless , there are indications that z - sources have luminosities comparable to the eddington limit .",
    "there are nine z - sources known , including the recent discovery of a transient galactic x - ray binary @xcite .",
    "two of them lmc x-2 @xcite and rx j0042.6 + 4115 @xcite are extragalactic ones .",
    "the radiative processes that produce the x - ray spectra of neutron star lmxbs are not well constrained . while , there have been attempts to have detailed theoretical model based on the accretion flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in general , two different phenomenological approaches have been adopted to model their spectra . in both these approaches ,",
    "the spectrum is modelled as sum of two main components , one arising from an accretion disk and the other from the boundary layer between the disk and the neutron star surface . in the first approach ( sometimes referred to as the `` western '' approach ) ,",
    "the accretion disk is considered to be a standard cold disk emitting a soft component , while the boundary layer radiates the harder comptonized component @xcite .",
    "in the second approach ( called the `` eastern '' approach ) , the boundary layer emits a cool black body emission while the harder comptonized component arises from an hot inner disk @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence for a variable hard power - law component in the spectra of five z - sources @xcite .",
    "the two approaches are difficult to distinguish primarily due to the absence of good quality low energy ( @xmath3-@xmath4 kev ) data and the uncertainty in the absorption column density .    to understand the phenomenology of these sources , it is important to study their complete spectral evolution in order to confirm any generic behaviour and to see if there are sub - classes of sources that have similar spectral evolution .",
    "there is already some evidence that z - sources may not be an homogeneous group .",
    "this was first indicated by @xcite who classified them into sco and cyg like sources .",
    "detailed study of spectral evolution along the z - track has been carried out for gx 349 + 2 @xcite , cyg x-2 @xcite , gx 17 + 2 @xcite and gx 340 + 0 @xcite . in general , there is considerable variation of the spectral parameters as a source moves along the z - track and the variations are not always similar in all sources , indicating that z sources are not an heterogeneous group .",
    "for example , as cyg x-2 moves from the hb to nb , the optical depth of the comptonized component decreases while the electron temperature increases dramatically from @xmath5 to @xmath6 kev . a more modest increase in electron temperature from @xmath7 to @xmath8",
    "is seen in gx 349 + 2 . on the other hand , for gx 17 + 2 the temperature decreases along the same track . along the flaring branch , detailed spectral evolution study has only been undertaken for gx 349 + 2 @xcite where the temperature increases along the track .",
    "while these results indicate that the physical parameters and conditions for these sources are different , what seems to be generic is that the effect of comptonization decreases along the normal branch while it increases along the flaring branch .",
    "this is revealed by the variation of the comptonization parameter @xmath9 , where kt@xmath10 is electron temperature , m@xmath10 is rest mass of electron , @xmath11 is speed of light , and @xmath12 is optical depth of corona",
    ". the comptonization parameter @xmath13 decreases along the normal branch and increases along the flaring one , a behaviour clearly seen in gx 349 + 2 .",

    "iron line emission is statistically significant for the normal branch . since the galactic neutral hydrogen column density in the direction of lmc x-2 is 6.3 @xmath24 10@xmath25 @xmath26",

    "the results of spectral fits are shown in table [ suz_west_par ] .",
    "the best fit @xmath27 gets pegged to the lower limit for both the data sets .",
    "the spectral variation is entirely due changes to comptonization .",
    "we repeat the spectral fitting using disk black body ( xspec model diskbb ) and the same comptonization model to represent `` eastern '' model .",

    "a similar trend is seen for the flaring branch , where the `` eastern '' model gives better @xmath29/d.o.f = 356/373 as compared to @xmath29/d.o.f = 442/374 .",
    "thus spectral fitting of _ suzaku _ data strongly prefers the interpretation where the soft component is disk emission rather than simple black body .",
    "note that this distinction is possible because of the imposed lower limit on the absorption column density .",

    "the column density is more uncertain and hence such distinction would not have been possible even with broad band data .",
    "the spectral fit to the non - flaring state is shown in fig .",
    "[ suz_spec ] .",
    "also plotted are the residuals with and without the addition of a systematic error of 2% .",
    "the column density is well constrained to 9 @xmath24 10@xmath25 @xmath26 and it is this value that has been used for fitting rxte data ( table [ specpar ] ) .",
    "the inner disk temperature @xmath34 , and the inner disk radius @xmath35 as well as the soft photon input temperature @xmath36 remain invariant between the flaring and normal branches .",
    "a broad iron line is significantly detected for both branches .",
    "the electron temperature decreases during the flare , which is consistent with behaviour seen by rxte , although _ suzaku _ data requires an higher temperature .",
    "more significantly it is the compton y - parameter which is seen to increase during the flare , which is again consistent with the rxte observations . using a distance of 50 kpc , the unabsorbed luminosities of flaring and normal branch turn out to be 2.1 @xmath24 10@xmath37 ergs / s and 2.2 @xmath24 10@xmath37 ergs / s , which for a @xmath38 neutron star correspond to 1.1 and 1.15 of the eddington value .",
    "a detailed spectral analysis of the extragalactic source lmc x-2 , has been undertaken using broad band data from _ suzaku _ and from a large ( @xmath28 750 ksec ) data set obtained using rxte - pca .    from the pca data",
    "the complete z - track evolution was obtained and spectra at eight representatives position were analysed . in the energy band of the pca ( 3 - 20 kev ) , a single component comptonization fit adequately represents the spectra from all the track branches .",
    "this is unlike other z - sources ( gx 349 + 2 : @xcite ; cyg x-2 : @xcite ) , where an additional soft component is required in the rxte energy band .",
    "the temperature of comptonizing cloud , @xmath39 is found to decrease from the horizontal to the normal branch ( see fig .",
    "[ spec_var ] ) which is similar to what is observed for gx 17 + 2 @xcite , but is in contrast to results from cyg x-2 @xcite and gx 349 + 2 @xcite where the opposite behaviour was found . along the flaring branch ,",
    "the temperature increases for lmc x-2 , which is again different from gx 349 + 2 where the temperature decreases . on the other hand , for lmc x-2 the compton y - parameter decreases along the horizontal and normal branch and increases along the flaring branch .",
    "this is consistent with what is observed for gx 349 + 2 and it seems to be a generic feature of z - sources .",
    "these results confirm that while details of the spectral evolution are different for each source , there are generic behaviour like the evolution of compton y - parameter which seems to be similar in all z - sources .",
    "the hard component evolution similarity between lmc x-2 and gx 17 + 2 suggests that there could be sub groups within z sources where similar physical conditions are met .",
    "the observed similarity in the spectral evolution seen in these two sources is also suggested in the near identical colour and hardness intensity diagrams of these sources .",
    "similar diagram are also observed in sco x-1 .",
    "hence , our results are consistent with the idea that z sources can be further divided into two subclasses , sco and cyg like sources @xcite with lmc x-2 being a member of the sco like class .",
    "while it was suggested earlier that the difference between sco and cyg like sources may be due to inclination angle @xcite , the spectral differences between lmc x-2 and other sources , suggest instead a more intrinsic difference between the two classes .",
    "analysis of z source xte j1701 - 462 reveales that the source evolves from cyg like to sco like z - source , suggesting that diffence between these two classes is not caused by difference in the inclination angle @xcite .",
    "the suzaku data provides broad band spectral and luminosity evolution of the source from the nb to the fb .",
    "as expected the data requires an additional soft component .",
    "this additional component was represented as a black body ( emitted from boundary layer ) and as emission from multicolour disk .",
    "the multi - colour disk approach ( sometimes called the `` eastern '' approach ) provides significantly better fit to the data .",
    "this spectral distinction is possible because the galactic neutral hydrogen column density along the direction of the source is @xmath27 = 6.3 @xmath24 10@xmath25 @xmath26 and hence the fitted absorption column density was restricted to be larger than this value .",
    "such a constrain is usually not available for galactic sources .",
    "the distance to lmc x-2 ( 50@xmath402 kpc ) is better constrained than those of galactic sources and hence broad band _",
    "data provides a better estimate of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity of the source for the normal branch is 2.1 @xmath24 10@xmath37 erg / s and for the flaring branch is @xmath28 2.23@xmath24 10@xmath37 erg / s .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty in the spectral fitting ( @xmath28 5% ) , the distance(@xmath28 5 % ) and calibration of different instrument ( @xmath41 10 % ) , one can put a highly conservative error estimate of @xmath42% on these luminosities .",
    "if the source reaches its eddington limit on the normal branch , this would imply that the mass of neutron star is 1.50@xmath400.1 m@xmath2 . if instead the source is eddington limited in the flaring branch one obtains a slightly higher mass of 1.61@xmath400.09 m@xmath2 .",
    "the phenomenological spectral models used in this analysis , a single temperature comptonized component and a multi - colour disk emission , is adequate considering the statistics of the available data and the uncertainties regarding theoretical models .",
    "however , considering that the system is a near eddington neutron star source , it is expected that the actual radiative processes would be considerably more complicated with possibly quantitative and qualitative differences as compared to the simple model adopted here .",
    "for example , detailed structural analysis of the boundary layer reveals a temperature and density stratified extended region @xcite .",
    "a fairly detailed model for z sources is where soft photons produced by electron cyclotron emission in the neutron star magnetosphere are comptonized primarily in a hot central corona @xcite .",
    "the outer accretion disk gets converted into a radial flow which also comptonises the outgoing photons .",
    "the phenomenological description in this analysis is broadly consistent with this picture with the temperature and optical depth of the comptonizing component identified as the average temperature and optical depth of the hot central corona .",
    "the source of seed photon for comptonization which is assumed to be a black body with temperature , @xmath36 in the xspec model comptt , will then be the electron cyclotron emission .",
    "finally the multi - colour disk component is the outer disk .",
    "note that from table [ suz_east_par ] , the seed photon temperature , @xmath43 kev is different from the inner disk temperature , @xmath44 kev and hence in this interpretation the seed photons are not produced by the outer disk .",
    "this is consistent with the above model , where the seed photons are produced in the magnetosphere .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of the analysis is that the inner disk radius , @xmath45 does not vary significantly when the source is in a flaring state and at @xmath46 km is about ten times the neutron star radius",
    ". the radius may be larger if the colour factor is significantly greater than unity as is assumed for the radius estimation .",
    "the luminosity of the disk emission is nearly 25% of the total luminosity and hence gravitational energy dissipation is not sufficient to power the disk . at ten times the star radius ,",
    "the gravitational energy dissipated should be only 10% or less of the total dissipation .",
    "instead the disk is probably heated by the inner corona and hence radiates such high luminosities .",
    "this is expected if the disk is truncated due to the radiation pressure of a near eddington inner corona .",
    "however , contrary to what is seen , in such a scenario , one would expect the inner disk radius and its luminosity should vary as the source goes into a flaring mode .",
    "the large inferred inner disk radius argues against the possibility that the broad iron line detected arises from the disk .",
    "instead , it may be speculated that it arises perhaps from the neutron star surface .",
    "unfortunately , the line is weak ( with equivalent width of @xmath47 ev ) and hence the statistics is not sufficient to test these ideas by modelling the line profile .",
    "it may also be that the phenomenological models used in this analysis do not sufficiently approximate the complex radiative process of the system .",
    "in particular , the soft seed photon input is assumed here to be a black body and this may not be the case . while the high energy spectrum is largely independent of the shape of the seed photon spectrum , the low energy spectrum will depend on its shape . in the framework of a model , the magnetosphere emission could be more complex than a black body",
    ". moreover there could be additional source of seed photons from the outer disk .",
    "such complexities may vary the disk emission parameters or even eliminate the need for the component .",
    "however , an arbitrary seed photon spectral shape will not be falsifiable by spectral analysis , since some shape will always be a good representation of the data .",
    "a theoretically motivated spectral shape for the seed photon is required . despite these caveats ,",
    "the spectral analysis shown in this work does reveal the overall behaviour of the source .",
    "model independently one can still conclude that the lower energy part of the spectrum ( which in this case is the seed photon source and the disk component ) do not vary as the source flares and the entire variation can be ascribed to the comptonizing cloud .",
    "the low statistics of the _ suzaku _ data did not allow for a detailed broad band spectral study of the source at it evolves along the z track .",
    "instead the data was split into two broad parts representing the flaring and non flaring periods .",
    "this is unfortunate , because such a broad band evolution study would have been able to test whether the bolometric luminosity increases monotonically along the track as expected by theoretical models and inferred by uv observations .",
    "the two main flares observed by _ suzaku _",
    "seem to be of similar strength ( fig [ suz_int ] ) , however , clearly this needs to be confirmed by longer duration observations .",
    "this will have important implications on whether the source is eddington limited during the flares or not .",
    "these deficiencies may be alleviated by a longer duration _ suzaku _ observations undertaken simultaneously with rxte .",
    "the pca data would distinguish the different track positions , while _ suzaku _ would provide broad band spectra for each position .",
    "alternatively , such results can be obtained by a long duration observation of the source by the forthcoming multi - wavelength satellite , astrosat .",
    "the proportional counter array on board ( laxpc ) would determine the z - track , while the uv and other x - ray instruments would give simultaneous broad band coverage .",
