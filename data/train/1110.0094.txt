    "@xmath6 gravity in which the einstein - hillbert action ( i.e. @xmath7 ) gets corrections by an arbitrary function of scalar curvature @xmath8 has become much popular in recent years .",
    "such an interest stems from cosmological observations and attempts to interpret the accumulated data .",
    "the accelerated expansion of our universe with dark energy / matter , phantom fields , quintessence and cosmological constant can all be addressed under a common modified theory entitled as @xmath6 gravity .",
    "dependence on the single ( and simplest ) ricci scalar @xmath8 becomes an advantage when compared with theories depending on the higher order invariants .",
    "the @xmath6 gravity , even in the absence of external sources is highly non - linear , but recent studies show that many exact solutions have been obtained @xcite ( for the review of the subject ) .",
    "no doubt , the freedom of adding suitable energy momentum in addition to those arising from curvature makes the theory further complicated , but interesting .    in this paper",
    "we wish to draw attention to another aspect of @xmath9 gravity which is local equivalence ( isometry ) with the spacetime of colliding plane waves ( cpw ) ( for the review of the subject see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown first by chandrasekhar and xanthopoulos ( cx ) in 1986 @xcite that part of black hole spacetime is locally isometric with the spacetime of cpw @xcite .    for black hole spacetimes with single ( event ) horizon , such as schwarzschild",
    ", the region of isometry is inside the horizon where the geometry admits two space - like killing vectors . for black holes that admit double horizons ( i.e. @xmath10 the  inner and @xmath11 the outer horizon ) such as reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) and kerr",
    ", the dynamical isometry region occurs in between the two horizons , @xmath12 .",
    "this property has been used in the past to generate cpw solutions from the known solutions of black holes @xcite .",
    "specifically , this technique has aided in generating regular classes of cpw solutions due to the fact that the singularity of the black hole is removed in the isometry process .",
    "let us note that the intrinsic connection between black holes and plane waves is not limited by the observation in @xcite .",
    "much earlier penrose proved a theorem @xcite in this connection : `` every spacetime admits a plane wave spacetime as a limit '' , and naturally black hole spacetimes are not exempted from this statement . for a class of extremal black holes we have shown even further , that the near horizon geometry coincides with that of cpw @xcite .",
    "being motivated by these past studies it is our aim to point out that similar isometries exist also in @xmath0 gravity and in a larger class of @xmath6 theories which admit rn solution of einstein s theory as a particular solution . to be on the safe side , however , in the satisfaction of @xmath6 equations in the limit",
    "@xmath13 we restrict ourselves to the @xmath0 case . in this study",
    "we consider a @xmath14 -dimensional spherically symmetric @xmath15 gravity solution without external sources .",
    "that is , the curvature creates its own source through the intrinsic nonlinearity .",
    "this derived source , or more popularly , `` source without source '' , turns out to be an electromagnetic - like source and the geometry is defined modulo the rn geometry . under a suitable transformation",
    "this part transforms into the spacetime of cpw .",
    "the set of boundary ( junction ) conditions for the cpw is adopted from the einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory in which the appropriate conditions are those of obrien and synge @xcite .",
    "these guarantee that non - physical terms , such as the product of two dirac delta functions , or any other undesired combinations do not arise at all .",
    "it should be added that a general analysis of junction conditions in more general @xmath6 gravity other than @xmath0 , deserves a separate study .    by construction",
    "our solution of cpw admits a horizon following the collision , in place of a spacetime singularity . whether the horizon is stable or not , and if stable / unstable , against what type of perturbations ,",
    "remain open to which we shall not address in this paper .",
    "further , by going from the interaction region ( region iv ) to the incoming regions ( regions ii and iii ) we identity , in analogy with taking the penrose - limit @xcite , the incoming plane waves prior to the instant of collision .",
    "region i is flat or the no - wave zone .",
    "extension into the incoming regions give us a class of plane waves in @xmath0 gravity which consist of a gravitational ( weyl ) and an energy - momentum part derived from the curvature . in this picture ( @xmath16 )",
    "plays the role of the electromagnetic charge so that we assume @xmath2 .",
    "similar analysis can be considered for different versions of @xmath9 gravity , provided the function @xmath6 is known explicitly .",
    "let us note that in most of the cases considered in cosmology a closed form(i.e .",
    "analytical ) representation for @xmath6 is not available . from physics standpoint",
    "a plane wave in general relativity is a representation of an infinitely boosted particle under proper limiting procedure @xcite . at such high speeds",
    "a particle loses its matter property and turns into a light - like wave . for this reason in the large hadron collision ( lhc )",
    "experiments the particle can alternatively and approximately be considered as a wave . from this token",
    "it should be added that the almost plane wave representation of an infinitely boosted proton , due to its internal structure ( i.e. colors , gluons , quarks , etc . )",
    "is yet to be found .",
    "our boosting process covers so far only point - like objects without internal structure . in this regard what is available at our disposal",
    "is no more than a coarse approximation to the exact case .",
    "another important item is that the horizons formed in cpw are unstable against arbitrary perturbations @xcite .",
    "this may be the classical justification that micro black holes formed at high ( tev scale ) energies are not stable / detectable . from the quantum picture",
    "the probability of black hole ( or any other objects , such as mini wormholes ) formation is non zero .",
    "however , if these objects are to be detected classically their stability must be verified . in this case",
    "the stability arguments of horizons in cpw may offer some hints .",
    "it is believed that modified theory of gravity such as @xmath6 with its rich content will give tangible results .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii summarizes @xmath9 gravity with its equivalence to the space of cpw .",
    "section iii discusses the properties of our colliding wave spacetime .",
    "comparison of einstein and @xmath5 theories takes place in section iv . conclusion and discussion in section",
    "v completes the paper .",
    "we consider the action in the form ( @xmath17 )    @xmath18 , \\ ] ]    where the function @xmath6 will be determined by the field equations in general and @xmath19 stands for the matter lagrangian . in this paper",
    "we shall confine ourselves to the particular case in which @xmath20 , so that any source , @xmath21 will be determined by the curvature .",
    "further , we shall follow an easier route to assume @xmath22 a priori , and use it to find the curvature sources . with these assumptions",

    "\\notag\\end{gathered}\\]]the latter equation admits either @xmath32 or @xmath33 which is the case of our interest here .",
    "the other equations also confine the parameter @xmath1 to @xmath2 in order to be satisfied .",
    "therefore setting @xmath33 admits a solution for @xmath34 as @xmath35here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are two integration constants . throughout the analysis",
    "we shall make the choice @xmath38 , since otherwise @xmath39 reduces to that of schwarzschild , and also our choice will be that of @xmath2 .",
    "this form of @xmath30 is easily identified as the rn black hole where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the mass and square of the charge , respectively . in the following analysis",
    "we shall make the simple choice @xmath40 without loss of generality .",
    "this class of solutions can be considered in three different cases , depending on the horizon(s ) , namely @xmath41this admits the roots@xmath42for @xmath43we can identity three different classes :    * i ) * @xmath44 * * , or * * @xmath45 : this brings us back to einstein s gravity , so it is not interesting for our purpose .    *",
    "ii ) * @xmath46 * * , or * * @xmath47 : this choice corresponds to the extremal rn whose near horizon geometry is the bertotti - robinson ( br ) spacetime .",
    "in other words , we have @xmath48now , making the transformation@xmath49 in the limit , @xmath50 , with the successive replacements @xmath51 and @xmath52 yields for the line element @xmath53this is the well - known br spacetime of em theory which can be transformed easily into the space of cpw by a well - established transformation @xcite . the resulting spacetime will be the bell - szekeres space time for colliding electromagnetic shock waves @xcite .",

    "our line element ( 5 ) reads now    @xmath57    in between the horizons    @xmath58    @xmath59 becomes space - like and @xmath60 becomes time - like .",
    "now let us apply the transformation    @xmath61    to the new coordinates @xmath62 from the old ones @xmath63 .",
    "next , we transform once more from @xmath64 to the null - coordinates @xmath65 by    @xmath66    in which @xmath67 are constants that we introduce for convenience .",
    "these measure the magnitudes of incoming energies and in case that we choose @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) we normalize those strengths to unity . after an overall scaling of coordinates @xmath70",
    ", @xmath71 and @xmath72 by the constant @xmath73 the line element takes the form    @xmath74    in which we have abbreviated @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "so far , we have only applied coordinate transformations on our original metric ( 5 ) until we reach at ( 20 ) .",
    "it is a remarkable observation at this stage that the metric ( 20 ) can be interpreted as a cpw metric under the substitutions    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the heaviside step functions corresponding to the two different null boundaries @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the adopted obrien - synge @xcite junction conditions guarantee in this process that no extra sources arise at the null boundaries .",
    "otherwise the metric can not be interpreted as a cpw spacetime and the idea should be discarded .",

    "1 depicts the details of the space time of cpw .",
    "the region i @xmath85 is flat . the region ii @xmath86has the wave profile    @xmath87    which is the superposition of an impulsive and a shock gravitational wave .",
    "since our class of solutions is valid for @xmath54 the impulse wave has trailing shock waves and both components of impulsive and shock waves are indispensable .",
    "the only surviving energy - momentum component in region ii is    @xmath88    the incoming region iii has the same structure as region ii with @xmath89 , @xmath90 so that the non - vanishing components are @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( see appendix a3 ) . after collision , in the interaction region ( region iv ) @xmath93 we have the additional components of @xmath94  and @xmath95 which did nt exist in the incoming regions .    it is observed from the np invariants that the interaction region @xmath96 has no singularities ( i.e. @xmath97 . on the null - boundaries , however , ( i.e. @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) there are null - singularities since the weyl components diverge there . in the interaction region",
    "@xmath100 none of the curvature invariants diverge , the metric function @xmath101 , however , vanishes which indicates a coordinate singularity .",
    "it can be recalled that before applying the coordinate transformation @xmath101 was @xmath102 whose zero gave rise to the horizon .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath103 , is the horizon that forms as a result of colliding waves . from the cpw experience in the em theory",
    "it is known that such horizons are unstable against perturbations @xcite .",
    "that is , addition of any small physical field gives rise to a back reaction effect which makes the horizon to transform into a true spacetime singularity . by extension beyond the horizon ( i.e. @xmath104 ) it",
    "is evident , for example somewhere within @xmath105 that we face a curvature singularity .",
    "it is expected that the same behavior takes place also in @xmath6 gravity .",
    "our example of solution is simple enough to simulate the cpw in em theory .",
    "any solution that will be found in this regard must inherit a more violent wave interaction and stronger singularity . in the interaction region",
    "@xmath100 we observe that off - the null boundaries the dirac delta functions vanish and only the shock terms survive . under this condition",
    "the weyl curvature components satisfy    @xmath106    which implies that the spacetime is of type - d , expectedly since after all it is a transform of a type - d spacetime . in this spacetime",
    "it can easily be shown that the massive scalar wave equation and hamilton - jacobi equations can easily be solved by separation of variables .",
    "let us add that the null coordinates @xmath65 is not an appropriate coordinate system for this purpose .",
    "a more appropriate coordinate system is given by @xmath107 , so that the scalar field equation is    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the covariant laplacian and @xmath36 is the mass of the particle .",
    "we seek a separability in the form    @xmath110    where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are constants and the functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 are functions of their arguments .",
    "the decoupled equations are reduced into quadratures    @xmath115    with the separation constant @xmath116 , @xmath117 is defined in the appendix a2 ) and sub @xmath118 / @xmath119 indices imply partial derivatives . in the next section",
    "we shall make a comparison between general relativity and @xmath120 gravity results in both the np quantities and the restricted geodesics .",
    "all the related tetrad scalars are given in the appendix ( a3-a5 ) .",
    "for @xmath122 they reduce to @xmath121 which are the results of general relativity . now , in order to compare with the case of @xmath5 we set @xmath123 in all quantities to the first order with @xmath124 and @xmath125 . upon substitution and expansion in first order of @xmath126",
    "we obtain the following forms @xmath127 in which @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the ricci and weyl components in the einsteins general relativity .",

    "this may be interpreted as the distortion of einstein s plane gravitational waves in the expanding universe model due to the @xmath5 gravity .",
    "these expressions complete the amplitudes of @xmath5 gravity in comparison with the general relativity at the first order .",
    "we consider the geodesics projected into the ( @xmath138 ) plane ( i.e. @xmath139cons .",
    ", @xmath140const . ) and for simplicity we fix the constants @xmath141 .",
    "the system can be described by the lagrangian@xmath142 in which @xmath143 so that @xmath144 is parametrized in terms of @xmath145 . with this much simplification",
    "the geodesics equation follows as@xmath146obviously an exact solution follows for the choice @xmath147 but in general the differential equation is highly nonlinear which can be expressed in terms of elliptic functions . since our aim is to compare geodesics with general relativity we take again @xmath148 , as we did above and make expansions in terms of @xmath126 .",

    "the geodesics take place within the region @xmath154 restricted by the horizon shown by the broken line in fig .",
    "the pathological problems associated with the singularities and horizons in colliding waves were exclusively discussed in the past ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) so that we did nt feel the necessity of repeating them here .",

    "our solution is single parametric with parameter @xmath155 .",

    "there are no separate maxwell equations for instance . in this way from the local isometry we construct cpw solutions from a particular @xmath6 gravity . by interpolating into the incoming regions we obtain a class of plane waves ( i.e. the penrose limit ) in this theory",
    ". in general , the weyl curvature of these plane waves are in the form of ( impulsive ) + ( shock ) waves .",

    "we remark that for more general ( and further nonlinear ) structure of @xmath6 theories new boundary conditions are required .",
    "we admit that our metric of cpw is the simplest one in which by virtue of @xmath33 all pertinent @xmath6 equations are automatically satisfied .",
    "we find all deviations of the weyl and ricci scalars from the einstein s gravity and compare also the geodesics to the first order . in analogy with the colliding electromagnetic @xcite and yang - mills @xcite shock waves our interaction region here also forms a horizon through which the spacetime can be extended analytically @xcite . as the next step we may consider the case of @xmath157constant .",
    "this will give rise to a cosmological constant @xcite whose colliding wave interpretation can not be considered free of null shells @xcite . finally we wish to comment on the importance of the collision problem presented in this paper .",
