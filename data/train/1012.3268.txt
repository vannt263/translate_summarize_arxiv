    "massive star formation ( msf ) has attracted much attention .",
    "it has enormous impact on the natal interstellar medium ( ism ) and on the evolution of galaxy .",
    "msf is believed to originate in dense molecular cores ( dmcs ) that can be traced by co and its isotopologues . with the help of mapping",
    ", we can reveal the structure of molecular cores and investigate the msf activity taking place within them .",
    "high velocity outflows have also been intensively studied .",
    "first uncovered in 1976 @xcite , molecular outflows toward massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) have attracted much attention @xcite . perhaps tracing the earliest stage @xcite of star formation , molecular outflows are critical in the debate about two mechanisms for msf : massive stars forming through accretion - disk - outflow or via collision - coalescence @xcite .",
    "the properties of outflows reveal the mass - loss phase before the main sequence .",
    "what we observe in the sky is not the real outflow but its two - dimensional projection .",
    "therefore , it is essential to know the inclination - angle @xmath3 between the outflow axis and our line - of - sight .",
    "for instance , it will introduce a factor of 1/cos@xmath3 to the momentum .",
    "so far the determination of the inclination - angle has been somewhat neglected though some previous researchers have made a few attempts by modeling @xcite .    until now",
    ", authors usually took assumptions for the inclination - angle .",
    "for instance , @xcite hypothesized 45@xmath5 while @xcite supposed 60@xmath5 .",
    "the outflow parameters derived from these assumptions can only be meaningful statistically , but they are not accurate .",
    "in addition , work has been done to study the collimation of outflows @xcite .",
    "however , the projection effect should also be included .    in order to directly calculate the inclination - angle and to eliminate or reduce outflow parameter uncertainties ,",
    "we propose a new method in this paper . in the next section",
    ", we will describe our observations of iras 05553 + 1631 . in section [ sec : results ] , the results will be presented .",
    "we will introduce our method and discuss some of its properties in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is a brief summary of our work .",
    "the observations were performed with the kosma 3 m submillimeter telescope at the gornergrat observatory in switzerland in 2002 to 2004 .",
    "the dual - channel - sis receiver was used .",
    "we observed simultaneously transitions in the 230 ghz tuning range ( @xmath1co j=2 - 1 ) and in the 345 ghz tuning range ( @xmath0co j=3 - 2 ) .",
    "the beam sizes were 120 `` at 230 ghz and 80 '' at 345 ghz .",
    "the beam efficiencies for 230 ghz is 0.68 and for 345ghz is 0.72 .",
    "the integration time for each point was about 1.5 min for both @xmath0co j=3 - 2 and @xmath1co j=2 - 1 .",
    "the system temperatures were about 160 k for @xmath1co j=2 - 1 and 235 k for @xmath0co j=3 - 2 .",
    "the spectral resolutions were 0.22 km / s and 0.29 km / s for @xmath1co j=2 - 1 and @xmath0co j=3 - 2 , respectively .",
    "we used the position - switch mode in the observations .",
    "the map step size is 1 arcmin .",
    "both @xmath1co j=2 - 1 and @xmath0co j=3 - 2 emission were detected and mapped .",
    "the typical @xmath1co spectrum is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig:13co ] .",
    "there is a single component in this molecular region .",
    "table [ tab : observed ] summarizes the parameters . column ( 1 ) is the iras source name .",
    "columns ( 2 ) to ( 5 ) are the positions of the source , including both the 1950 coordinates and the 2000 coordinates . columns ( 6 ) to ( 8) list the @xmath1co j=2 - 1 spectrum parameters derived from gaussian fitting . columns ( 9 ) to ( 11 ) exhibit the iras flux parameters .",
    "according to @xcite , iras sources that satisfy log(f@xmath7/f@xmath8)@xmath90.57 , log(@xmath10/f@xmath8)@xmath91.30 and that peak at 100 @xmath11 are promising candidates for uc hii regions . from table",
    "[ tab : observed ] we can see that the first two criteria are satisfied . we confirm that iras 05553 + 1631 has its maximum flux at 100 @xmath11 .",
    "the results show that iras 05553 + 1631 is a candidate for uc hii region .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig:13co ] shows the core contours .",
    "the grey - scale background is msx 8.28 @xmath11 emission .",
    "the three msx sources are named as s@xmath12 , s@xmath13 , and s@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "spatially , s@xmath12 and s@xmath13 are both possibly associated with the core .",
    "we also made use of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) data .",
    "s@xmath12 has one 2mass counterpart 05581473 + 1631070 whose magnitudes in the j , h , and k@xmath15 bands are 13.103 , 10.752 , and 9.041 , respectively ; s@xmath13 has one 2mass counterpart 05581574 + 1631373 whose magnitudes in the j , h , and k@xmath15 bands are 12.571 , 11.886 , and 11.565 , respectively .",
    "s@xmath12 is the reddest source and more likely to be correlated with the molecular core .",
    "figure [ fig:12co ] presents the @xmath0co j=3 - 2 results . in the p - v diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) , the wide wings are obvious .",
    "the velocity ranges of the high - velocity gas were determined as -8 km s@xmath16 to 3.1 km s@xmath16 and 8.5 km s@xmath16 to 13 km s@xmath16 ( hereafter refered to as hv - ranges ) for blue and red lobes , respectively .",
    "the hv - ranges were integrated into the outflow contour diagram ( figure [ fig : outflow ] ) .",
    "the outermost blue and red contours are 50 per cent of the blue and red peak intensities , respectively .",
    "the contours show a bipolar structure .",
    "@xcite has identified yso g192.16 as the driving source .",
    "both their work ( see figure 1 of their paper ) and our result ( figure [ fig : outflow ] ) show that the blue lobe is more extended from g192.16 than the red one .",
    "g192.16 is in good alignment between the two outflow lobes , and we adopt g192.16 as the driving centre .    the core parameters are summarized in table [ tab : core ] .",
    "column ( 2 ) lists the 1.4 kpc distance calculated using the galactic rotation model @xcite while @xcite gave a distance of 2.0 kpc .",

    "columns ( 5 ) to ( 8) are derived from the radiation transfer equation . a ratio of 8.9@xmath1710@xmath18 for [ h@xmath13/@xmath1co ] was adopted to calculate the h@xmath13 column density ( column 8) . in column",
    "( 9 ) , we give the h@xmath13 density calculated from the column density and the diameter ( which is twice the radius ) . in the calculation of lte mass which",

    "column ( 1 ) indicates the outflow lobes .",
    "column ( 2 ) lists the outflow sizes .",
    "the thick contour was covered by an ellipse whose major axis is the linear length from west to east and whose minor axis is the linear length from north to south .",
    "the outflow sizes are the lengths of semimajor axes .",

    "the integration is over the hv - range .",
    "the @xmath0co j=3 - 2 transition is usually optically thick even in the line wings @xcite , therefore we adopted a mean optical depth @xmath21 of 4 @xcite .",
    "for the mass calculation , an [ h@xmath13/co ] ratio of 10@xmath22 was taken .",
    "momentum and energy are displayed in columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "the adopted velocity @xmath23 is the line - of - sight velocity divided by cos@xmath3 where @xmath3 is the inclination - angle .",
    "column ( 6 ) shows the dynamical timescales which were estimated as r/@xmath23 where r is the distance from the driving centre to the peak of high - velocity gas .",
    "the mechanical luminosity , driving force , and mass - loss rate are listed in columns ( 7 ) to ( 9 ) , respectively .",
    "they were calculated as e / t , p / t , and p/(tv@xmath24 ) , respectively @xcite , where v@xmath24 is the wind velocity assumed to be 100 km / s . in the calculation",
    ", we first assumed @xmath3=45@xmath5 , the calculation will be improved with our method ( see section [ sec : outflow ] ) .",
    "table [ tab : core ] shows that the core has a size @xmath250.65 pc and that m@xmath26 is equal to 120 @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath1co line width is 2.5 km s@xmath16 which is larger than those of low - mass cores @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the core is massive . according to virial theory ,",
    "a core is gravitationally bound when its mass is larger than its virial mass . in our results , this is not satisfied , which is possibly due to the [ h@xmath13/@xmath1co ] ratio adopted or the optically thick assumption for @xmath1co j=2 - 1 emission ; alternatively , the core may be unbound .      in our calculation for outflow parameters ,",
    "45@xmath5 was assumed as the inclination - angle .",
    "actually , almost all the outflow parameters depend on the angle .",
    "for instance , the velocity of outflow gas is the projection along our line - of - sight .",
    "therefore a factor of 1/cos@xmath3 should be introduced .",
    "the same goes for momentum , timescale , etc . , but sometimes with different factors .",
    "the inclination - angle also affects the collimation factor .",
    "thus , accurate determination of @xmath3 is important .",
    "unfortunately , until now , people assume a value for @xmath3 @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we propose a new method to improve this situation .",
    "our method to derive @xmath3 requires knowledge of the outflow geometry , so before the calculation , it is necessary to discuss something about the shapes of outflows .",
    "generally , without impact from the surrounding materials , the molecular outflows are likely to be axially symmetric .",
    "this could be inferred from the symmetry of the outflow contour diagrams ( @xcite , figure 2 ; @xcite , figure 5c ; @xcite , figure 13 ngc 2071 ) and from modeling @xcite . in our results ,",
    "the p - v diagram ( figure [ fig:12co ] ) and the outflow contours ( figure [ fig : outflow ] ) show good symmetry , especially the blue lobe .",
    "in addition , the ellipse - like outflow contours indicate a projection of a conical outflow ( see section [ sec : more ] ) . since a cone is an ideal form for an axially symmetric outflow ( see section [ sec : comparison ] , paragraph 2 ) , we assume that the shape of the outflow is a cone .",
    "we also assume that high velocity components form cone - shell like structure whose emission intensity decreases from inside to outside .",
    "the cone could be called a `` cone onion '' .",
    "when we observe , what we see is the outflow projection on the sky .",
    "thus , if the outflow axis is at an angle @xmath3 to our line - of - sight , the contours will appear as ellipses ( figure [ fig : cone ] ; the contours could also be parabola or hyperbola , see section [ sec : more ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] presents the calculation of the inclination - angle @xmath3 . in figure",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , one can see the driving centre and an elliptical outflow contour . from figure",
    "[ fig : model](b ) , a relation of the four angles : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath3 can be expressed by equation ( [ equ:4angle ] ) @xmath31 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the angle distances in the contour - diagram ( @xmath28 accounts for the angle between driving centre and point d ; @xmath29 is the angle between driving centre and axis point a ) . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are usually very small ( about several arcmin ) , thus the small angle approximation is valid . @xmath30 and @xmath3 are unknown .",
    "then , we have to find another equation for either @xmath30 or @xmath3 .",
    "notice that the length of line ab does not change as a function of @xmath3 . in figure",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the angle between oa and ob .",
    "overlines indicate length .",
    "if the outflow contour is not symmetric about line ao , we take @xmath33 as half the angle @xmath34 .",
    "we have already assumed the shape of cone , so the opening angle @xmath3-@xmath30 is the same for the entire cone .",
    "therefore in figure [ fig : model](b ) we have @xmath35 @xmath36 where o@xmath12 and o@xmath13 are the same points as o in the plane of the sky .",
    "@xmath37 is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "thus , combining equations ( [ equ : a ] ) , ( [ equ : b ] ) , ( [ equ : c ] ) , and substitute @xmath37 with @xmath38 we have @xmath39 putting together equation ( [ equ:4angle ] ) and equation ( [ equ : alpha ] ) , we can solve the inclination - angle @xmath3 by eliminating @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath33 can be derived from the outflow contour , we try to further manipulate the two equations to obtain a better expression .",
    "we define the `` angle constants '' @xmath40 and @xmath41 combining equations ( [ equ:4angle ] ) and ( [ equ : alpha ] ) and eliminating @xmath30 , we have @xmath42 defining the `` angle function '' @xmath43 after determining p and q , we obtain the inclination - angle by solving the `` angle equation '' @xmath44      we utilize our method on iras 05553 + 1631 .",
    "figure [ fig : theta ] shows the derivation process . in general , the shapes and positions in figure [ fig : theta ] are similar to those in our model ( figure [ fig : model](a ) ) .",
    "table [ tab : comparison ] presents the comparison between newly derived and old outflow parameters .",
    "we find the inclination - angles to be 73@xmath5 and 78@xmath5 for blue and red lobes , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the two outflow lobes are in good alignment . in table",
    "[ tab : comparison ] , compared with the former results , the newly derived parameters have rather large corrections . for the blue lobe , the momentum is enlarged by a factor of ( cos45@xmath5/cos73@xmath45 ) 2.4 , as the velocity is corrected by 1/cos@xmath3 .",
    "the correction for energy is proportional to that of p@xmath46 which is about 5.8 .",
    "the timescale is reduced by a factor of ( cot73@xmath5/cot45@xmath45 ) 0.31 .",
    "the correction factors for mechanical luminosity , driving force , and mass - loss rate are 19 , 7.7 , and 7.7 , respectively . for the red lobe ,",
    "the analysis is similar , but the factors are different .",
    "these results suggest that the correction from inclination - angle can not be neglected and our method is practical .    from the process of our method one can see that the cone assumption ensure the viability of equation ( [ equ : alpha ] ) . if not , the equation would be an approximation .",
    "let @xmath47=@xmath3-@xmath30 , the taylor expansion of tan@xmath3 around @xmath47 is ( keeping the first order ) tan@xmath3=tan@xmath47+@xmath48 .",
    "for the blue outflow lobe in our case , tan@xmath47=0.143 , if @xmath49=1@xmath5 ( 0.017 radians ) , then the second term of the taylor expansion would be @xmath250.018 , the uncertainty is about 12 per cent . for the red outflow lobe",
    ", the uncertainty is about 4 per cent .",
    "geometrically , when a cone is cut by a plane , the resulting curve can be an ellipse ( including a circle ) , a parabola , or a hyperbola , depending on the angle between the cone - axis and the plane .",
    "for an ellipse , the larger the inclination - angle is , the larger its eccentricity will be , and vice versa .",
    "when @xmath3 approaches 90@xmath5 we obtain a parabola or a hyperbola . theoretically , all of the curves can be utilized for the calculation .",
    "but the ellipse has the advantage that it is usually much more conspicuous and easy to manipulate .",
    "the parabola and the hyperbola , on the contrary , can be confusing because of the large inclination - angle .",
    "the outflow edge from the driving source has very weak emission and the contours exhibit a fan - like structure .",
    "the centre and the curve will be ambiguous .",
    "the opposite extreme is when the inclination - angle becomes zero and the ellipse changes to a circle .",
    "fortunately , the angle equation ( [ angle equation ] ) still works . in the angle function ( [ angle function ] ) ,",
    "the coefficient of the first term @xmath50 is ( @xmath51=@xmath52=@xmath53 ) .",
    "as @xmath3 approaches zero , the projection shape becomes a circle and @xmath541 .",
    "meanwhile , cos@xmath3 @xmath551 and the second term vanishes .",
    "thus a(@xmath560)@xmath551 .",
    "the angle equation ( [ angle equation ] ) is tenable in this extreme case .",
    "however , when @xmath3 approaches zero , use of this method could be problematic if the resolution is low .",
    "another property is the collimation . in our view , it can be manifested by the opening angle @xmath3-@xmath30 . larger @xmath3-@xmath30 means lower collimation , and vice versa .",
    "thus it is reasonable to define a collimation factor as cot(@xmath3-@xmath30 ) ( = ( tan@xmath33sin@xmath3)@xmath16 ) . in iras 05553 + 1631",
    ", the factors are 7.0 and 1.6 for blue and red lobes , respectively .",
    "one thing should be mentioned , the ellipses we used for iras 05553 + 1631 are 90 per cent contours ( figure [ fig : theta ] ) as stronger emission could reduce the errors .",
    "if we chose the 50 per cent contours , the factor would change . additionally , the method highly depends on the accuracy with which the driving centre is located .",
    "one question is the identification , and the second is the spatial resolution .",
    "the identification involves personal judgement , which is accompanied by considerable uncertainty in some cases .",
    "@xcite showed that 6.7 ghz methanol maser and relevant 24 @xmath11 emission usually coincide with each other and they are good tracers to the driving centre , this may offer much help for the identification .",
    "the resolution is usually low for single - dish observations .",
    "using high - resolution telescopes and interferometers can improve this .    in the angle function ( [ angle function ] ) , there are two parameters p and q. since we can always choose an ellipse excluding the driving centre , it is reasonable to assume 0@xmath57p@xmath571 .",
    "figure [ fig : q ] illustrates the value of q , which shows the projection on x - z plane .",
    "lines ao@xmath12 and ad represent the projections of two conditions for the plane of the sky : ( 1 ) ao@xmath12 perpendicular to o@xmath13e ( solid , hereafter named c1 ) ; ( 2 ) ad not perpendicular to o@xmath13e ( dashed , hereafter named c2 ) .",
    "condition c2 is denoted by prime .",
    "@xmath58 equals the @xmath59 of figure [ fig : model](a ) .",
    "thus , it is easy to see that the maximum of q is @xmath60 which is just 1/cos(@xmath3-@xmath30 ) . since ( @xmath3-@xmath30 ) can not be large and an angle of 60@xmath5 can only bring q=2 , we consider 0@xmath57q@xmath572 .",
    "when p=0 , the second term of the angle function ( [ angle function ] ) vanishes and @xmath3=arccos(1/q ) . in order to have solution , q must be larger than 1 .",
    "in fact , in this case q reaches its maximum ( see figure [ fig : q ] ) .",
    "the result is 0@xmath6171@xmath5 .",
    "when p=1 , there is no solution .",
    "figure [ fig : curves ] shows the variation of the angle function as a function of p and q. with a fixed q , the function decreases as p increases . with a fixed p ,",
    "the function decreases when q increases . usually within ( 0@xmath5,90@xmath5 ) , there is one solution . when q approaches 1 ( figure [ fig : curves](d ) ) , in order to have solution , p must be closer to 0 .",
    "when p approaches 1 , the same happens to q. the variation of angle function is sensitive to the values of p and q.",
