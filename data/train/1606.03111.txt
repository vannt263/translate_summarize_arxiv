    "description of nuclear pairing correlation has been a major subject in recent nuclear physics . for instance , in self - consistent meanfield ( scmf ) description of atomic nuclei , there have been various approaches in order to take the nuclear pairing correlation into account @xcite . these approaches based on the scmf or the nuclear density functional theory ( dft )",
    "have provided considerable agreements with the measured binding energy as well as its odd - even staggering for bound nuclei . even with these efforts , however , the complete character of the nuclear pairing correlation has not been revealed .",
    "for example , whether the phenomenological pairing interaction should have the volume or surface type of density dependence is still an open question @xcite . at present",

    "recently , it has been expected that the two - proton ( ) radioactivity may provide novel information on the nuclear pairing correlation . in the true  emission @xcite",
    ", a pair of protons is emitted simultaneously from the parent nucleus , whereas the single - proton emission is forbidden or strongly suppressed due to the pairing correlation energy .",
    "the proton - proton pairing plays an essential role to determine the observables , especially the released energy ( q - value ) as well as the -decay width or lifetime @xcite .",
    "the released q - value can be related with the proton - proton pairing strength in bound nuclei . on the other hand",
    ", the -decay width has no correspondence in bound systems , whose lifetime is trivially infinite .",

    "thanks to the experimental developments , there has been a considerable accumulation of data for the -emitting nuclei @xcite . on the other side , however , theoretical studies have not been sufficient to clarify the relation between the  radioactivity and the pairing correlation @xcite . because  emission is a typical many - body problem , its elucidation could also provide an universal knowledge on the multi - particle quantum phenomena in various domains .",

    "the @xmath78-@xmath126 relation obtained with the different pairing strengths is present in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "obviously , the enhanced ( reduced ) q - value leads to the increase ( decrease ) of the decay width .",

    "similarly in table [ table : cp ] , the spin - singlet width is universally dominant , whereas the spin triplet width , indicated by the gap of the total and the spin - singlet widths , shows the similar values in both cases . in our calculations throughout several @xmath78 values ,",
    "the sddc pairing commonly yields the smaller width than the minnesota pairing .",
    "consequently , the difference in @xmath126 is not attributable to the q - value sensitivity , but concluding the pairing model - dependence .",

    "the first effect drives out the two - proton wave function tunneling the potential barrier , whereas the second favors a large probability density outside the core .",
    "this mechanism then yields a loose stability with shorter mean lifetime . on the other hand , in the volume sddc case",
    ", two - proton density hardly diverges with the isotropically attractive pairing interaction .",

    "because our three - body hamiltonian itself is not time - dependent nor self - consistent , it is not completely clear whether the similar density - dependence effect can be reflected on the scmf or dft calculations . thus , it is suggestive to expand our procedure to these frameworks @xcite , which enables us to perform the systematic investigation along the -drip line .",
    "the work toward this direction could be helpful to sophisticate the theoretical pairing models , utilizing the -decay data as the reference quantities .",
    "an experimental survey widely for the -emitter candidates could be profitable for this purpose @xcite .    with the simple sddc pairing force , there remains a tri - lemma of @xmath141 , and the two - nucleon scattering length in vacuum , @xmath142 . in order to reproduce the whole two - body and three - body properties consistently to experiments ,",
    "further model development is necessary .",
    "we also found another kind of sensitivity to the range of pairing force .",
    "considering the experimental q - value , with the finite - range minnesota potential , we finely reproduced the experimental -decay width @xcite . on the other side , at the zero - range limit of that potential ,",
    "theoretical -decay width is significantly narrow .",
    "because the density - dependence is absent in these cases , there should be another logic to explain the different width .",
    "for this clarification , a further systematic analysis with respect of the interaction range may be helpful .",
    "even it demands computational efforts , the work toward this direction is in progress now .",
    "also , it might help to resolve the tri - lemma problem of 2p - decay .",
    "comparison with other kind of experimental data , _",
    "e.g. _ momentum distributions in refs .",
    "@xcite , is an important topic for future work .",
    "for this purpose , however , the present model space should be expanded sufficiently to reliable handle the long - range coulomb effects .",
    "although the computational cost is highly increased , it may provides another procedure to validate effective pairing models .",
    "t. oishi sincerely thank kouichi hagino and hiroyuki sagawa for fruitful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by academy of finland and university of jyvskyl within the fidipro programme .",
