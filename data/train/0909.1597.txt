    "many aspects of our real world have been understood in the context of complex networks  @xcite and simple physical models of critical phenomena on networks .",
    "contrary to regular lattices in the euclidean space , complex networks are characterized by a highly heterogeneous structure as manifested in broad degree distributions .",
    "recent studies on equilibrium or nonequilibrium systems have revealed that the heterogeneity is one of essential ingredients determining the universal feature of phase transitions and critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the concept of the phase transition is well defined only in the thermodynamic limit where the system size is taken to infinity .",
    "so it is important to understand how finite - size effects come into play near the transition .",
    "such a task for physical models on regular lattices has been successfully accomplished by the standard finite - size scaling  ( fss ) theory  @xcite , based on the ansatz that a single characteristic length scale  ( correlation length ) @xmath0 competes with the system s linear size @xmath1 .",
    "then , any physical observable depends only on a dimensionless variable @xmath2 in the scaling limit .",
    "near a second - order continuous transition , the correlation length diverges as @xmath3 with the reduced coupling constant @xmath4 and the finite - size effects become prominent .",
    "the fss theory for complex networks can be formulated in a similar way : since the euclidean distance is undefined in complex networks , one may take the volume scaling variable as @xmath5 with the system size @xmath6  ( the total number of nodes ) and the correlated volume @xmath7 .",
    "the correlated volume diverges @xmath8 near the transition  ( @xmath9 in @xmath10 dimensional lattices ) .",
    "for example , the magnetization of the ising model scales as @xmath11 where the scaling function @xmath12 for small @xmath13 and @xmath14 for large @xmath13 with the order parameter exponent @xmath15 .",
    "the fss theory with a single characteristic size has been tested numerically in many systems  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the exact values for the fss exponent @xmath16 are conjectured  @xcite by estimating the correlated volume  ( droplet ) size for the nonequilibrium contact process  ( cp ) and the equilibrium ising model in random uncorrelated networks with static links , which are denoted as _ quenched _ networks .",
    "however , considering a highly heterogeneous scale - free  ( sf ) network , one should take into account not only a broad degree distribution of @xmath17 but also the upper cutoff @xmath18 in degree , which scales as @xmath19 . without any constraint , @xmath18",
    "is bounded naturally with @xmath20 . in general",
    ", one may impose a _ forced _ cutoff with @xmath21 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath18 diverge simultaneously and @xmath22 sets a route to the limit .",
    "therefore , one can suspect that the fss theory may depend on the routes or equivalently on the value of @xmath22 , especially for networks with a broader distribution for small @xmath23 .    for the quenched sf networks , it has been suggested that the fss does not vary with @xmath22 for a weak forced cutoff  ( @xmath24 ) , which was confirmed numerically in various types of sf networks  @xcite .",
    "however , in the _ annealed _ networks where links are not fixed but fluctuate randomly in time , it was rigorously shown that the cp model exhibits an anomalous fss for any forced cutoff with @xmath25 where a heterogeneity(@xmath23)-dependent critical scaling appears  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the anomalous fss is characterized by a cutoff(@xmath22)-dependent and two - parameter scaling with four distinct scaling regimes  @xcite , in contrast to the cutoff - independent and single - parameter scaling with three scaling regimes in the standard fss theory .",
    "the anomalous fss of the cp in the annealed sf networks gives rise to a natural question : what is the main ingredient causing the anomaly ?",
    "some possible guesses may be a nonequilibrium feature of the cp , absorbing nature  ( vanishing activity ) at criticality , or heterogeneity of networks  @xcite . in this paper , we answer to this question by studying the ising model , a prototype equilibrium phase transition model , in annealed sf networks .",
    "we find the same type of the anomalous fss scaling  ( cutoff - dependent and two - parameter scaling with four distinct scaling regimes ) for any forced cutoff with @xmath26 where the @xmath23-dependent critical scaling appears in the thermodynamic limit for the ising version .",
    "in addition , the trivial shift of the critical point in finite systems adds one more complication on the critical fss , though it does not cause any fundamental change .",
    "in summary , our results may draw a general conclusion that the anomalous fss scaling should appear in any critical system in the annealed sf networks for any forced cutoff  ( @xmath21 ) with the degree exponent @xmath23 such that a @xmath23-dependent new singularity arises in the physical quantities as @xmath27 .",
