    "we have shown in previous works @xcite that this produces a large increase of the magnitude of the scalar qcd susceptibility over its vacuum value .",

    "represents the ( in - medium corrected ) born part of the @xmath66 amplitude while the first piece represents the non - born part linked to nucleonic excitations .",
    "thus there exists a universal scaling factor between the responses of a nuclear or nucleonic system to probes which couple either to the nucleon scalar density fluctuations or to the quark ones .",
    "this relation has allowed us to infer the existence of a contribution to the qcd nucleon scalar susceptibility linked to the scalar meson . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this contribution to the nucleon susceptibility has not been discussed previously .",
    "it has a link , through the relation ( [ chisns ] ) , to the optical potential for the @xmath44 propagation , which reduces the sigma mass in the medium .",
    "in order to illustrate the coherence of this approach we will now extend the previous description to incorporate the effect of the two - pion propagator , @xmath75 which affects the nucleon susceptibility in the following way .",
    "the sigma propagator is renormalized by the @xmath44 coupling to two - pion states , as discussed in @xcite . at zero four - momentum",
    "we have  : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and both @xmath78 and @xmath79 are taken at zero four - momentum .",
    "in the last term we have restricted to the one pion loop level .",
    "we stress that this expression only holds for the sigma , chiral partner of the pion , which is not a chiral invariant field",
    ". it does not apply to the scalar field responsible for the nuclear binding which has to be a scalar invariant ( that we have denoted @xmath80 ) and which is weakly coupled to two - pion states , while the @xmath44 is strongly coupled .",
    "therefore this treatment is done for illustration purpose and not for an application to nuclear physics .",
    "the medium correction to @xmath81 from the coupling of the @xmath44 to @xmath82 states is  : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the in - medium modification of the two - pion propagator . in @xmath84 ,",
    "to lowest order , one and only one of the two pions of the two - pion propagator has to be dressed by one p - h bubble .",
    "it is again possible to interpret the corresponding modification of the sigma propagator as representing a @xmath66 scattering amplitude , @xmath85 , in which the sigma interacts with the nucleon pion cloud  : @xmath86 this is to be compared to the nucleon scalar susceptibility from the pion cloud , which is @xcite  : @xmath87 the proportionality factor between the susceptibility ( [ chispion ] ) and the @xmath66 scattering amplitude ( [ tpisn ] ) is the same as previously , @xmath88 .",
    "we find again that this relation holds not only at the level of p - h excitations but also for a single nucleon , at the level of the nucleonic excitations which in this specific case are of the pionic type .",
    "+ in summary we have seen that the mixing between the quark density fluctuations and the nucleon ones implies that the response of a probe which couples to the nucleonic density fluctuation is proportional to the qcd scalar response .",
    "this includes also the nucleonic contribution to these responses . as an example",
    "we have shown that the chiral dropping of the sigma mass in the medium has a counterpart in the form of a contribution of the scalar meson to the qcd scalar susceptibility of the nucleon .",
    "it is now interesting to connect our results to the available lattice simulations of the evolution of the nucleon mass with the pion mass , equivalently the quark mass . at present",
    "they do not cover the physical region but only the region beyond @xmath89 .",
    "the derivative @xmath90 provides the nucleon sigma commutator . in turn",
    "the derivative of @xmath10 leads to the susceptibility .",
    "both quantities are strongly influenced by the pion cloud contribution which has a non - analytic behavior in the quark mass , preventing a polynomial expansion in this quantity .",
    "however the pionic self - energy contribution to the nucleon mass , @xmath91 , has been separated out in ref .",
    "@xcite in a model dependent way with different cut - off forms for the pion loops ( gaussian , dipole , monopole ) with an adjustable parameter @xmath92 .",
    "the remaining part is expanded in terms of @xmath93 as follows : @xmath94 the best fit value of the parameter @xmath95 which fixes the susceptibility shows little sensitivity to the shape of the form factor , with a value @xmath96 while @xmath97 ( in a previous work @xcite smaller values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 were given  : @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) .",
    "we can infer the non - pionic pieces of the sigma commutator and of the susceptibility from the expansion ( [ expansion ] )  : @xmath102 it is largely dominated by the @xmath98 term .",
    "the corresponding value for @xmath100 is @xmath103 .    in turn",
    "the nucleon susceptibility is  : @xmath104 the non - pionic susceptibility is found with a negative sign , as expected from the scalar meson term . in ref .",
    "@xcite however , the negative sign is interpreted differently .",
    "it is attributed to possible deviations from the gellman - oakes - renner ( gor ) relation which links quark and pion masses .",
    "it is then interesting to test if the empirical values from the lattice are compatible with a pure scalar meson contribution .",
    "we thus tentatively make the following identifications  : @xmath105 with @xmath106 ( taking @xmath100 one would get @xmath107 ) .",
    "it is interesting to translate this number into the value of the mean scalar field in the nuclear medium which , to leading order in density , is  : @xmath108 at normal density the value @xmath109 , quite compatible with nuclear phenomenology .",
    "the second identification concerns the susceptibility .",
    "if the non pionic susceptibility would arise entirely from the scalar field , we should have  : @xmath110 which would give , using the gor relation  : @xmath111 much larger than the lattice value , @xmath112 .",
    "again , taking @xmath100 one would get @xmath113 , still larger in magnitude than the corresponding lattice value @xmath114 .",
    "thus the linear @xmath115 model which fails to account for the saturation properties , due to the excess attraction produced by the chiral softening of the sigma mass , also leads to too large a susceptibility from the scalar meson .",
    "in fact in this work we show that the two problems are linked .",
    "some mechanism suppresses the chiral softening of the @xmath44 mass as well as the large nucleonic susceptibility from the scalar meson , incompatible with lattice data .",
    "it is indeed likely that the scalar meson is not the only non - pionic contribution . in a previous work",
    "@xcite we have invoked confinement and the quark meson coupling model ( qmc ) @xcite as a source of cancellation for the chiral softening of the sigma mass .",
    "it turns out that it has also a cancelling effect in the nucleon scalar susceptibility .",
    "indeed , for 3 valence quarks confined in a bag of radius r , guichon @xcite derived @xmath116 , for a value @xmath117 .",
    "translated into the parameter @xmath99 , one has @xmath118 .",
    "contrary to the other components which are negative ( of paramagnetic nature ) , it has a positive sign ( of the diamagnetic type , linked to quark - antiquark excitations ) .",
    "the bag susceptibility indeed produces a mild cancellation effect .",
    "it is then natural to try to extend the linear sigma model description so as to incorporate other effects than the scalar meson ones ( or chiral symmetry breaking effects ) , for instance those arising from confined valence quarks .",
    "in view of the limitations of the linear sigma model discussed previously , a more general approach is desirable .",
    "the aim is to link the response of the nuclear medium to the scalar nuclear field and the qcd responses , in such a way that both quantitites include all the components of the individual nucleon contribution whatever their origin .",
    "of course it is not possible to achieve this goal without some assumptions on the nature of the probe .",
    "we keep the basic assumption that the scalar field which couples to the nucleons , couples to the quarks of the nucleon condensate , as is the case in the linear sigma model .",
    "thus its presence can induce a readjustement of the quark structure of the nucleon , that we evaluate in the way described below .",
    "consider a nuclear medium with a scalar nucleon density @xmath6 . by definition the response of this medium to a scalar field which couples to the nucleon scalar density fluctuations ( with a unit coupling constant ) is the change in the nucleon scalar density for a small change of the nucleon mass .",
    "it is @xmath119 , the derivative being taken at constant chemical potential . with a coupling constant @xmath30 this result",
    "should be multiplied by @xmath120 . in the free fermi gas case",

    "the mean field @xmath125 is obtained from the minimization equation of the energy density @xmath127   : @xmath128 it is then possible to check that the derivative of the scalar nucleon density with respect to the nucleon mass leads to the full rpa scalar polarization propagator , @xmath129 , as defined in eq .",

    "the nucleon structure is not incorporated .",

    "i.e_. , the quark structure .",
    "it is the quark medium , and not only the nucleon one , which responds to the same excitation , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the modification of the nucleon mass @xmath130 . accordingly we make the following conjecture , writing the full response @xmath131 as  : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the quark scalar density and the factor @xmath134 in front of the derivative is put for normalization purpose .",
    "each nucleon containing a scalar number of quarks @xmath135 , the scalar density of quarks is @xmath136 .",
    "the derivative involves two terms  : @xmath137 in the last term we have replaced the derivative with respect to the nucleon mass by the one with respect to the quark mass , with @xmath138 , which introduces the nucleon susceptibility @xmath139 .",
    "the overall result writes  : @xmath140 the interpretation of this equation is clear .",

    "this results holds for a unit coupling constant . for a coupling constant @xmath30 (",
    "as is the case for the nuclear scalar field ) the r.h.s should be multiplied by @xmath120 .",
    "accordingly the corresponding @xmath66 amplitude is  : @xmath143    we will now comment this result and we then will apply it to the problem of the propagation of the scalar field which mediates the nuclear attraction .",
    "our relation ( [ ras ] ) has a close resemblance to the previous one , ( [ resp ] ) , derived in the linear sigma model but here we do not inquire about the origin of the terms , @xmath139 and @xmath144 . with the values of the linear sigma model for these quantities",
    "we recover the previous result of this model .",
    "our relation ( [ ttotal ] ) is also very similar to the one of the quark - meson coupling model @xcite . in qmc ,",
