    "high - temperature superconductivity remains to be an exciting and rich field .",
    "one of the interesting proposals is anderson s resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state.@xcite in the rvb theory , the parent compound is an insulator at half electron filling , or one electron per cu - site , and chemical doping is essential to introduce charge carriers to lead to superconductivity .",
    "the mathematics of the rvb theories therefore is in a hilbert space which completely projects out the on - site double - occupied electron states . at the half",
    "filled , there is exactly one electron per lattice site , and the charge degree of freedom is totally frozen , resulting in a mott - insulator .",
    "another interesting class of materials in the context of strongly correlated systems is the layered organic conductors,@xcite which may undergo a phase transition from an insulator to a superconducting ( sc ) state by applying pressure.@xcite since these materials are effectively at half filling,@xcite the phase transition is due to the competition between the coulomb interaction and kinetic band width , the latter of which is tuned by pressure instead of chemical doping . there have been several related theoretical works on layered organic superconductors in recent years.@xcite the mathematics of the sc state may be described by a partially gutzwiller projected bcs state,@xcite instead of the complete projection as in the rvb theory .",
    "we shall refer to this partially gutzwiller projected bcs state as a gossamer superconductor , a phrase first introduced by laughlin@xcite originally in the context of high temperature superconductors .",
    "gossamer superconductivity refers to those sc states with a dilute superfluid - density .",
    "the partial gutzwiller projection allows charge fluctuations even at half filling .",
    "one of us@xcite proposed that in this case an effective model is the hubbard - heisenberg model which includes the standard kinetic energy , the on - site coulomb repulsion , as well as the anti - ferromagnetic spin - exchange .",
    "the idea was applied to the study of @xmath5-(bedt - ttf)@xmath6 by gan _",
    "et al_,@xcite , where the gutzwiller approximation was used to replace the partial gutzwiller projection by a set of renormalized factors and the resulted renormalized hamiltonian was then studied by a mean field theory .",
    "the finding is a phase - diagram distinguishing three phases : normal metal , superconductor and anti - ferromagnet .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study the phase diagram of an effective hubbard - heisenberg model by using variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method .",
    "the order - parameters for the d - wave superconductivity and for the anti - ferromagnetism are calculated directly .",
    "we obtain a phase diagram consistent with the experiments , providing further support to the scenario of the gossamer superconductivity to describe the layered organic conductors .",
    "interestingly , our numerical calculation of the sc order parameter suggests a relatively high superfluid density near the phase boundary to the afm insulator .",
    "the results from our vmc calculations also provide support to the earlier mean field results based on the gutzwiller approximation,@xcite although we find a less sensitive role of @xmath1 .",
    "we study a hubbard - heisenberg model in a 2-dimensional lattice illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by    @xmath7    here @xmath8 is the electron annihilation operator of an electron with spin @xmath9 on site @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the spin-1/2 operator at site @xmath10 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the sum @xmath13 is over the nearest neighbors ( n.n . ) pairs on the square lattice , and the sum over @xmath14 is over both the n.n .",
    "pairs and the diagonal bonds ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "1 ) . we set the n. n. hopping @xmath15 as the energy unit , and fix the spin exchange @xmath16 as @xmath17 , and treat the diagonal hopping integral @xmath18 and the on - site repulsion @xmath2 as tuning parameters . in our numerical calculations , we consider a @xmath19 by @xmath19 lattice and use a periodic boundary condition along the x - direction and antiperiodic boundary condition along the y - direction",

    "has the following form in real space :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the spatial position of an electron with spin @xmath9 at the lattice site @xmath27 , and the sum is over all the pairs of a spin - up electron at the site @xmath27 and a spin - down electron at site @xmath28 . here @xmath29 is the amplitude of the wave function , which is the fourier transform of @xmath30 , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 given in the usual bcs wavefunction :    @xmath33    we have@xcite : @xmath34 following the previous literature on the pairing symmetry for the model @xcite , we focus here on the @xmath35-wave pairing state , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 have the following forms ,    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are variational parameters in the theory .",
    "note that @xmath43 in general due to the spin coupling term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the advantage of the above trial wave function is that the sc and afm order can be treated on an equal footing .",
    "it turns out that a small value of @xmath24 improves the energy of the sc state , while a sufficiently large value of @xmath24 leads to afm long range ordering .",

    "to measure the sc long range order , we introduce a pair correlation function :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a spin singlet bond between the two sites @xmath10 and @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for @xmath55 . @xmath56 describes a d - wave singlet bond around the site @xmath10 .",
    "the off - diagonal long range order parameter for the d - wave pairing can be measured by the quantity at @xmath57 , @xmath58 where the sum is over all the lattice sites . in our calculations on the finite size systems , we choose @xmath59 , the largest displacement on the lattice of @xmath19 by @xmath19 with @xmath19 upto 10 .    to simplify the variational procedure , we will fix @xmath41 in the calculations with the reasons given below .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are not independent in the variational calculations for the @xmath60 model .",
    "we found that the results are essentially insensitive to @xmath41 for the present model .",
    "in contrast , @xmath42 is an important variational parameter here .",
    "the ground state energies and the ground state phase is sensitive to @xmath42 over a wide parameter - range . by fixing @xmath41 , we have then four variational parameters ( @xmath61 ) in our calculations to determine the phase diagram in the parameter space of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "+ there are two sources of error bars in our numerical calculations within the variational approach .",
    "one is from the statistical errors , and the other is due to the discreteness of the variational parameters in our calculations . in our simulation , we start with several different initial configurations and then average our numerical measurements over those simulations . the error - bars obtained in these averages are found to be one order of magnitude smaller than the error - bars described below .",
    "we consider the possible values for the variational parameters and divide them into small slices",
    ". then we perform vmc for all combinations of this `` mesh '' . after obtaining an optimal set of variational parameters in this mesh for a particular set of @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ", we develop a local mesh for nearby values of the tuning parameters . from the spacing of our mesh",
    ", we obtain the error - bars for the variational parameters .",
    "the results and the error - bars we present in this paper are essentially due to the finite elements we choose in the variational parameters .",
    "of hamiltonian ( 1 ) as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath17 and various values of @xmath4 .",
    "the inset is an enlarged figure for the energy . ]        in this section , we present our results on the variational ground state , the corresponding variational parameters , the sc and afm long range orders of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in the parameter space of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "since the phase of the ground state is much more sensitive to the on - site repulsion @xmath2 than to the diagonal hopping @xmath1 , we focus our study on three values of @xmath1 , with @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ global ] we plot the obtained ground state energies as functions of @xmath2 for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding optimized variational parameters and long range sc and afm order parameters as functions of @xmath2 for three sets of values of @xmath1 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ bigpicture ] .",
    "the simulations are carried out on lattice sizes of l=6 , 8 , and 10 , as indicated in the figure .",
    "before we discuss the results , we note that the spin coupling term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is to account the virtual hopping process in the hubbard model , which is derived at the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the present study may be of relevance to the hubbard model only at large @xmath2 , but not at small @xmath2 .",
    "our main interest will be at large or intermediate values of @xmath2 , and the interpretation of our results at small @xmath2 to the hubbard model should be cautious .    before we discuss general features , we briefly discuss the obtained variational parameter @xmath42 , which is to optimize the kinetic energy due to the presence of the diagonal hopping integral @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath42 increases as @xmath1 increases , but @xmath42 is significantly smaller than @xmath1 as we can see from the first row in fig .",
    "[ bigpicture ] . at large @xmath2 , @xmath42 becomes zero or very tiny .",
    "this may be understood as a result of the afm ground state with commensurate wave vector @xmath63 , since a finite @xmath42 does not match the afm state and is not preferred .",
    "as @xmath2 increases from zero , the projection parameter @xmath23 increases from around @xmath64 , indicating a graduate increase in gutzwiller projection , while the weighting factor parameter @xmath24 changes little at small @xmath2 , but changes rapidly around @xmath65 .",
    "the mean field pairing amplitude parameter @xmath40 changes slowly at small @xmath2 , but increases rapidly starting from around @xmath66 , then reaches a maximum at around @xmath67 and drops at larger @xmath2 .",
    "the ground state properties are best seen in the measurement of the sc order parameter @xmath68 and afm order parameter @xmath69 .",
    "qualitatively there are three regions as @xmath2 increases . at small @xmath2 , both @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    "are very tiny or essentially zero , indicating a metallic state . at intermediate @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath68 increases monotonically with @xmath2 , while @xmath69 remains tiny , indicating a sc state .",
    "as @xmath2 further increases , @xmath68 drops sharply , while @xmath69 increases rapidly .",
    "we may identify this phase as the afm phase without the sc order .",
    "the tiny but non - zero values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the non - ordered states may be explained as finite size effect , although a systematic scaling analyses is difficult due to the small sizes we have studied .",
    "the above features are qualitatively similar for @xmath70 .",
    "this is somewhat different from the early analytic calculations by using gutzwiller approximations on the projected wavefunctions , where @xmath1 is found to suppress the afm phase .",
    "we note that while the onset for the sc - phase is similar for different @xmath1 , the magnitude of the sc - order parameter is much bigger for the @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "as we can see from the figure , the largest sc order parameter @xmath68 is found near the boundary to the afm - phase . at @xmath73",
    ", we expect the model ( 1 ) to have instability towards a commensurate afm state for any finite @xmath2 .    in fig .",
    "[ gossphase ] , we plot the phase diagram of model ( 1 ) obtained within our variational wavefunctions .",
    "while the phase - boundary between sc and afm can be found easily by considering one point clearly belonging to the afm and one point clearly belonging to the sc phase , between sc and metallic phase we have to use an arbitrary value to define the phase - boundary , as the onset of the sc - order parameter @xmath68 is not so sharp .",
    "we choose @xmath74 as our criteria classifying the phase to be sc .",
    "the error - bars in this diagram reflect within which area we have uncertainty that a point would be in either of the two phases considered . comparing the phase diagram obtained in the vmc method with the previous result by using renormalized mean field theory,@xcite they qualitatively agree with each other in the sense both give the three phases , and overall features are similar . however , there are two differences . first , while both of the methods give the transition point between the sc- and afm - phases to increase when @xmath4 increases , in the vmc calculation , the effect is not as big as in the earlier gutzwiller - approximation based calculation . in our calculation",
    "if we consider a fixed and non - zero @xmath42 instead of a variational one , we would in fact get a slope close to the one reported by gan _",
    "et al_. the second difference is that our vmc suggests the onset for superconductivity to be at @xmath75 for all cases , while gan _",
    "et al _ find this phase boundary changing considerable when tuning @xmath4 .",
    "we believe that these differences can be attributed to the different method and wave - function used . for comparison with the experiments ,",
    "we plot a schematic phase diagram for the layered organic conductors at the right panel of the figure .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented the results of vmc calculations for a recently suggested model for gossamer superconductivity .",
    "our trial wave function has the ingredient to describe metallic , afm and sc states .",
    "this was archived by means of using jastrow - factors for partial gutzwiller - projection and afm - weighting .",
    "we showed that the vmc result is consistent with experiments , and supports the previously suggested analytical variational calculations qualitatively , as we were able to identify the three expected phases , with the help of measurements of the order - parameters for afm and sc .",
    "the exact transition line between sc- and metallic - phase , and between sc- and afm - phase differs from the one found previously .",
    "the vmc calculations have been carried out on the hpcpower - cluster , the winhpc - cluster and the windows - condor all powered by hku s computer centre .",
