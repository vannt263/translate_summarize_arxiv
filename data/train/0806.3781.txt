    "this work is organized as follows : ",
    "[ mmt ] describes our mmt observations , ",
    "[ model ] outlines the lensing analysis ,   [ discuss ] discusses the lensing interpretation of these observations , and   [ con ]",
    "gives some closing remarks with thoughts toward possible future observations .",
    "unless explicitly stated , all magnitudes are in the ab system @xcite .",
    "we adopt the following cosmological model : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26  km  s@xmath27  mpc@xmath27 where @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "while the radio and optical properties provide a broad redshift constraint on the lensing object of @xmath21 , little is known about the optical arc .",
    "therefore , we observed the putative gravitational arc on may 18 , 2007 with the blue - channel spectrograph on the 6.5  m mmt , and obtained 4@xmath292400  s and 1@xmath291200  s exposures . for these observations , our @xmath30 slit tracked through the sky at the parallactic angle , as the object varied in airmass of @xmath31 , which was very closely aligned with the position angle of the arc seen in the left panel of figure  [ mod ] . with",
    "the 500  grooves  mm@xmath27 grating , the spectral resolution was 3.6  with a dispersion of 1.2    pix@xmath27 .",
    "we observed feige  34 throughout the night to determine the spatial point - spread function ( psf ) and to serve as the spectrophotometric flux standard star .",
    "the two dimensional spectra were reduced by standard algorithms using custom routines in idl .",
    "the ccd read noise , gain , and dark rate were @xmath32  @xmath33 , @xmath34  @xmath33  adu@xmath27 , and @xmath35  @xmath33  pix@xmath27  hr@xmath27 , respectively . to determine an accurate trace , we simply rebinned the two dimensional spectrum in wavelength to boost the relatively poor signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the one dimensional spectrum was extracted from a given frame using the observed psf as weights in both axes .",
    "finally , the wavelength solution for each frame was determined from an henear comparison lamp , which was observed at the corresponding position on the sky .    despite the long integration time",
    "( 3  hours ) on the arc , the total signal - to - noise per pixel is relatively low .",
    "therefore , we rebinned the calibrated , sky - subtracted , and stacked spectrum to @xmath36     for @xmath37     and @xmath38     for @xmath39   . at this resolution ,",
    "a weak spectral break is identifiable at @xmath40   , however we can not conclusively determine whether it is the lyman ( @xmath41   ) or the balmer/4000     break .",
    "therefore , to determine the most likely redshift with its associated uncertainty and relative probability , we computed a spectrophotometric redshift ( eg . * ? ? ? * ) with the redshift code , ` hyperz ` @xcite .",
    "we did not include the @xmath19-band flux in the fit , since the mmt slit did not fully encompass the hst - wfpc2 aperture .",
    "we adopted a grid of synthetic spectra @xcite parameterized by an exponential star formation history with @xmath42-folding times of @xmath43  gyr and ages of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the age of the universe .",
    "the final grid of spectral templates is defined by the extinction of @xmath46 for @xmath47 .    in figure",
    "[ spec ] , we show the observed spectrum as filled points with the best fit template as a solid line . in the inset , we show the relative probability , which indicates two possible redshift solutions : the balmer/4000     break at @xmath48 or the lyman break at @xmath49 .",
    "if the arc - like object is at @xmath48 , then it is likely an unrelated foreground galaxy to j121839.7 + 295325   with @xmath50  mag .",
    "however , if it is at the higher redshift , then the observed arc morphology in the hst - wfpc2 imaging suggests that j121839.7 + 295325  may be gravitationally lensing a background source . without a flux measurement blueward of the blue channel spectrum",
    "( @xmath51   ) to break this redshift degeneracy ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can only make statistical statements regarding the redshift of the arc and the physical interpretations of the system . from the inset in figure  [ spec ] ,",
    "the integrated probabilities of the two peaks are 13% and 87% for the balmer/4000    and lyman breaks , respectively .",
    "since the lyman break redshift is @xmath52 times more likely , we will further develop the lensing hypothesis .",
    "the best - fit template found by ` hyperz ` has an age of @xmath53  myr , instantaneous burst with @xmath54  mag , which is similar to the lyman break galaxies at @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "therefore the most likely redshift of arc is @xmath0 , which we derive from @xmath56}$ ] and @xmath57 .",
    "we observed j121839.7 + 295325  with the sao wide - field infrared camera ( swirc ) on march 19 , 2008 and obtained @xmath58  s and @xmath59  s dithered images in the @xmath60- and @xmath61-bands , respectively .",
    "these data were reduced by standard algorithms with a similar suite of idl routines used for the blue - channel reductions .",
    "the seeing was relatively constant through the night at @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the @xmath60- and @xmath61-bands , respectively .",
    "the sky image per object frame was created using ` sextractor ` @xcite . in the @xmath64 field - of - view , each object frame contained three stars from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog @xcite , which we used to calibrate the astrometry of each frame and to determine the flux zeropoint , with the ( @xmath65 ) magnitude conversions of @xcite .",
    "the astrometrically corrected , sky - subtracted images were averaged together with a 1@xmath66-clip into stacked science frames .",
    "we disregard a small portion of the swirc field - of - view owing to appreciable cosmetic defects .",
    "therefore , the stacked images each contain @xmath67  objects and yield number counts which are consistent with the @xmath60-band galaxy counts of the chandra deep field and hubble deep field , south ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 2 ) . based on a power - law fit to our observed counts , we estimate the @xmath68 , 50% completeness limits are @xmath69  mag and @xmath70  mag .",
    "the assumed lensing galaxies is not detected in either of these bandpasses , which may suggest that j121839.7 + 295325  is indeed a rather dark object . to estimate our detection limits in the infrared imaging , we determine the limit corresponding to a @xmath68 fluctuation at the position of the radio source .",
    "for a circular aperture with a radius of @xmath71 , these limits are @xmath72  mag and @xmath73  mag and are used below to derive the limits on the mass - to - light ratios .",
    "if we are to interpret this system in the context of gravitational lensing , we must investigate whether lensing can provide a sensible explanation of the optical arc .",
    "the morphology of the arc immediately implies that the lensing galaxy can not be circular : a circular lens that produces such a long arc ( compared with the radius of curvature ) would produce a prominent counter - arc as well .",
    "in contrast , an elongated galaxy can produce a single long arc either as a highly - distorted single image , or as a merged triplet of images . that leaves the question of how to interpret the compact , high surface brightness knot just off the east end of the arc .",
    "since there is no natural way to interpret the arc and knot as lensed images of single source , the knot is either a lensed image of a second source , or an unrelated foreground object .",
    "we attempted to model the knot as a lensed image , although it has little impact on the results since the observed image merely determines the properties of the assumed second source .",
    "we did not make a prior assumption about whether the arc is a single image or merged triplet .",
    "instead , we merely postulated that there are two sources behind an elongated lens galaxy .",
    "we treated the sources as circular gaussians for simplicity , fitting for their positions , sizes , and fluxes .",
    "we treated the lens galaxy as an isothermal ellipsoid , fitting for its position , einstein radius , ellipticity , and position angle . for a given set of model parameters",
    ", we used the software package ` lensmodel ` @xcite to find the images of the two sources , which we compared to the observed arc and knot on a pixel - by - pixel basis to compute the @xmath74 goodness - of - fit .",
    "we used a downhill simplex method to search the parameter space , with an inner loop to optimize the source parameters for a fixed lens galaxy , and an outer loop to optimize the galaxy parameters as well .",
    "in the best - fit model , the lens has an einstein radius of @xmath1 and ellipticity of @xmath75 , the two sources are separated by @xmath76 , and the reduced - chi squared is @xmath77}\\!=\\!0.94 $ ] . in figure",
    "[ mod ] , we show the hst - wfpc2 image ( left ) , the lens model ( middle ) , and the reconstructed source plane ( right ) .",
    "the mass enclosed within the einstein radius slowly varies with the lens redshift between @xmath78  m@xmath3 ( see the upper panel of figure  [ mass ] ) , which is a relatively large mass to have been undetected in the hst - wfpc2 and mmt - swirc imaging .",
    "there are three additional points to make regarding the lens models .",
    "( 1 ) in successful models , the arc is a single highly - distorted image of a source lying just outside a cusp caustic in the source plane .",
    "we did not impose this as an assumption , it emerged naturally from the modeling .",
    "( 2 ) the present model does not explain the variation in surface brightness along the arc , because we used a simple gaussian source simply to reproduce the shape of the arc .",
    "if the arc is indeed singly - imaged , then the surface brightness variation along the arc merely represents the intrinsic variations of the source .",
    "( 3 ) our model predicts a compact , faint counter - image just beyond the center of the lensing galaxy ( see middle panel of figure  [ mod ] ) .",
    "there appears to be some flux in roughly the right location in the hst - wfpc2 image , however it is likely associated with a hot pixel .",
    "we did not use the portion of the image as constraints to the lens models .",
    "= 0.75    since j121839.7 + 295325   is undetected in the hst and mmt imaging , we can only determine a lower limit on its mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we must convert the above detection limits ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) to the luminosity in a fixed bandpass to determine a mass - to - light ratio , which is independent of redshift . to facilitate direct comparisons with other galaxies , we opt to @xmath81-correct our limiting apparent magnitudes to the rest - frame @xmath82-band absolute magnitudes .",
    "these conversions require assuming a template sed for the undetected lensing galaxy ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to highlight two extreme possibilities",
    ", we show the range of the dynamical mass - to - light ratio consistent with the @xmath19-band ( blue ) , @xmath60-band ( green ) , and @xmath61-band ( red ) imaging as derived from the e ( middle ) and i m ( bottom ) templates @xcite in figure  [ mass ] .",
    "the shaded region shows the likely lens redshift , as discussed in   [ intro ] .",
    "if a stellar component to j121839.7 + 295325  exists , then we expect it likely has an early - type based on its radio flux ( eg .",
    ". therefore , to be compatible with the observations , j121839.7 + 295325   likely has @xmath83",
    "m@xmath3  l@xmath7 , and could be as dark as @xmath84  m@xmath3  l@xmath7 for the late - type sed .",
    "these limits will slightly decrease / brighten by including dust obscuration , since some fraction of the stellar light may be extincted and increase the maximum luminosity , for fixed flux limits .",
    "however , even with a modest amount of extinction ( @xmath85  mag ) , the intrinsic mass - to - light ratio would still be @xmath6  m@xmath3  l@xmath7 ( for the early - type template ) .",
    "nevertheless , the wfpc2 @xmath19-band observations generally provide the strongest constraint , owing to the relatively shallow swirc observations .",
    "the hst - wfpc2 imaging suggests that j121839.7 + 295325  is gravitationally lensing a background object .",
    "our blue channel spectroscopy supports this hypothesis by placing the optical arc is likely at high redshift ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "given the flux limits from hst - wfpc2 and mmt - swirc ( @xmath87  mag , @xmath72  mag , and @xmath88  mag ) , we find the lensing object may be rather dark , with a @xmath82-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath83  m@xmath3  l@xmath7 . from the k20 survey , @xcite find a dynamical mass - to - light ratio of @xmath89  m@xmath3  l@xmath7 for their sample of 18  early - type galaxies at @xmath90 .",
    "their upper limit can be extended to @xmath91  m@xmath3  l@xmath7 by including a sample of 28  galaxies from the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "this mass - to - light ratio is roughly consistent with the @xmath92 early - type galaxies of @xcite , which have @xmath93  m@xmath3  l@xmath7 . by comparing to a series of @xmath94 studies , they find the mass - to - light ratio of early - type galaxies evolves as @xmath95 , since the low redshift ellipticals have @xmath96  m@xmath3  l@xmath7 @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if our lower limits derived in   [ model ] are correct , then j121839.7 + 295325  may be a relatively dark galaxy , whose total mass is dominated by dark matter . while there are solid statistical arguments that such objects should exist @xcite , there are currently no confirmed examples .",
    "since direct optical observations of these extreme mass - to - light objects will be nearly impossible , they will likely manifest themselves as `` dark lenses '' @xcite .",
    "the most common suggestions of dark lensing have arisen from wide - separation quasar pairs ( wsqps ) , quasars with nearly identical optical spectra separated by @xmath97 , with no identifiable lensing source .",
    "detailed analyses of the spectra of these quasars , from the radio to the @xmath98-rays , have revealed that all known wsqps are simply binary quasars @xcite .",
    "additionally , the cosmic shear survey with hst @xcite has identified a number of gravitational lenses .",
    "in one particular field , @xcite suggested that the conspicuous tangential alignment of galaxies with arc - like morphologies and no obvious over - density of foreground galaxies may be a dark lens .",
    "however , @xcite ruled out this hypothesis by demonstrating the colors of these galaxies are inconsistent with high redshift , lensed objects .",
    "since j121839.7 + 295325  remains unidentified in the optical and near - infrared , it is a good candidate for a dark lens .",
    "however , the bright radio emission of @xmath12  mjy suggests that the lens object likely contains an active galactic nucleus ( eg .",
    "if a baryonic counterpart to this radio source exists , then it likely corresponds to a massive and perhaps extincted galaxy , which would make it similar to the distant red galaxies ( drgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the extremely red objects ( eros ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume the optical / infrared color of @xmath99  mag typical of an ero , then j121839.7 + 295325   must have @xmath100  mag and a stellar mass of @xmath101  m@xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* based on their figure  7 ) . in this case , our lens models imply that j121839.7 + 295325would have a dynamical - to - stellar mass ratio of @xmath102 , which is significantly higher than the @xmath103 star - forming galaxies with @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "the hst - wfpc2 and mmt data suggest that j121839.7 + 295325  is an extremely dark galaxy worthy of follow - up observations to confirm or exclude this hypothesis .",
    "in particular , with deeper optical spectroscopy of the arc , our redshift analysis can be verified .",
    "moreover , observations blueward of the blue channel spectroscopy will break the redshift degeneracy of @xmath105 and @xmath106 . owing to the necessary wavelength ( @xmath107   ) and flux limit ( @xmath108  mag ) , these observations could be conducted with the ultraviolet channel of the wide field camera  3 ( wfc3 ) for hst .",
    "since the radio source has not been optically identified , its redshift can only be very coarsely constrained .",
    "the majority of millijansky radio sources have early - type morphologies and colors at @xmath109 ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consequently its balmer/4000     break will occur at @xmath110 . furthermore , j121839.7 + 295325  is undetected to faint flux - levels , and may require a rather deep ( @xmath111  mag ) imaging campaign . therefore , medium - band or grism observations in the infrared mode with wfc3 would better constrain the lens redshift .",
    "should such observations support our proposed lensing scenario , this system could be among the most distant known gravitational lenses @xcite , a dusty ero with @xmath112  m@xmath3 , or a genuine dark lens , which would be a unique confirmation of the @xmath14cdm paradigm .",

    "<S> we present evidence that the optically unidentified radio source , first j121839.7 + 295325 , may be strongly lensing a background galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the redshift of the assumed gravitational arc , discovered in parallel imaging with hst , from mmt - blue channel spectroscopy to be @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we present lens models with an einstein radius of @xmath1 which contains a mass of @xmath2  m@xmath3 , where the uncertainty reflects the range of possible lens redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the putative lens is not detected to @xmath4  mag and @xmath5  mag in our mmt - swirc imaging . using the flux limits from wfpc2 and swirc </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that the dynamical mass - to - light ratio of j121839.7 + 295325 is @xmath6  m@xmath3  l@xmath7 for @xmath8  mag , and this lower limit could be as high as @xmath9  m@xmath3  l@xmath7 for @xmath10  mag . since the radio source is optically unidentified ( @xmath11  mag ) and has a radio flux of @xmath12  mjy , it is likely a massive early - type galaxy which hosts a radio - loud agn at @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> . however , the present data can not uniquely determine the mass - to - light ratio of the lensing galaxy , and hence the possibility that this system may be a reasonably dark lens is not ruled out . </S>"
