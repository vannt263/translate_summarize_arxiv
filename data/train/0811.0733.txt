    "it has been recognized that orbital degree of freedom is important for magnetism in some materials , such as colossal magneto - resistance and complex ordered phases of manganites  @xcite , and exotic magnetism in @xmath0-electron systems  @xcite .",
    "the orbital degree of freedom plays an important role in particular for realization of ferromagnetism . in two orbital models at quarter - filling ,",
    "i.e. , the electron number per site is one , a perfect ferromagnetic state realizes with antiferro - orbital ( af - orbital ) order in the strong coupling limit  @xcite . on the other hand , in the intermediate coupling regime , it is not obvious whether the inclusion of the orbital degree of freedom is enough for the stabilization of ferromagnetism .",
    "in addition , it is interesting whether the perfect ferromagnetic state is continuously connected to the paramagentic state through partial ferromagnetic states or the ground state changes abruptly from the perfect ferromagnetic state to the paramagnetic state at a certain interaction strength .    in this study , in order to unveil the ground state property in a system with the orbital degree of freedom in weak coupling to strong coupling cases , we study spin and orbital states of the two - orbital hubbard model by using a variational monte carlo method at quarter - filling . a similar model has been studied by the variational monte carlo method for states without orbital order , and it has been found that staggered orbital correlation enhances in a ferromagnetic state in a strong coupling region  @xcite . in the strong coulomb interaction limit , the ground state should be the ferromagnetic state with af - orbital order , and in the weak coupling case , the ground state is the disordered state .",
    "in this study , in addition to these two states , we consider a purely af - orbital ordered state without magnetic order , a purely magnetic ordered state without orbital order , and partial ferromagnetic state with and without af - orbital order .",
    "the two - orbital hubbard model is given by the following hamiltonian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the annihilation operator of the electron at site @xmath3 with orbital @xmath4 ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) and spin @xmath7 ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the fourier transform of it , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "we consider the nearest neighbor hopping and the dispersion is given by @xmath13 .",
    "we set the lattice constant unity .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 denote the intra - orbital coulomb , inter - orbital coulomb , exchange , and pair - hopping interactions , respectively .",
    "we evaluate expectation value of energy for variational wave functions by using the monte carlo method .",
    "we consider a gutzwiller - projected wave function of a mean - field type wave function as a variational wave function  @xcite . in this study , we consider staggered order of spin and/or orbital states for the mean - field type wave function .",
    "the variational wave function is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gutzwiller projection operator defined in ref  @xcite .",
    "the mean - field type wave function @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the vacuum .",
    "the quasiparticles occupy @xmath23 states for each spin @xmath7 from the lowest quasiparticle energy state , where @xmath23 is the number of electrons with spin @xmath7 .",
    "the number of parameters in the gutzwiller projection can be reduced from sixteen to ten by considering symmetry  @xcite , and we can further reduce the number of the parameters to seven when we fix @xmath23 .",
    "the energy of the quasiparticle in the ordered state is given by @xmath24 the creation operators of quasiparticles are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ordering vector considered in this study and @xmath27^{1/2},\\\\    v_{\\bm{k } \\tau \\sigma}=\\left [ \\left ( 1+\\epsilon_{\\bm{k}}/\\sqrt{\\delta^2_{\\tau \\sigma}+\\epsilon^2_{\\bm{k } } } \\right ) /2 \\right]^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quasiparticle gap in the ordered state is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 denote the gap for charge , spin , orbital , and spin - orbital ordered states , respectively .",
    "we evaluate the expectation value of energy for the variational wave function by using the monte carlo method , and optimize these gap parameters and the gutzwiller parameters to minimize energy .",
    "we can also evaluate energy by fixing some parameters , for example , we set all the gap parameters zero for the disordered phase .",
    "in addition to states without magnetization , we also consider states with finite magnetization @xmath33 .",
    "energy as functions of the coulomb interaction obtained with several variational functions ( a ) for @xmath34 , ( b ) for @xmath35 , ( c ) for @xmath36 , and ( d ) for @xmath37 .",
    "dash - dotted line , dotted line , dashed line , and solid line represent energy of hartree - fock wave functions for @xmath38 para - orbital , @xmath38 af - orbital ,",
    "@xmath39 para - orbital , and @xmath40 para - orbital , respectively.,width=566 ]    figure  [ fig ] shows energy @xmath41 per site as functions of @xmath14 of several states for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 on a @xmath42 lattice .",
    "we have used the relations @xmath43 and @xmath44 . note that at @xmath34 , the orbital space is equivalent to the spin space and we can exchange them , for example , the ferromagnetic af - orbital state is equivalent to antiferro - spin ferro - orbital state . at @xmath45 ,",
    "the orbital space is not equivalent to the spin space , and the ground state is uniquely determined except for trivial degeneracy , e.g. , the degeneracy due to the rotational symmetry in the spin space .",
    "the lines are the hartree - fock energy , i.e. , without the gutzwiller projection .",
    "we find that the paramagnetic ( @xmath40 ) orbital - disordered ( para - orbital ) state has the lowest energy for @xmath46 , where @xmath47@xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 , the perfect ferromagnetic ( @xmath38 ) af - orbital state becomes the ground state .",
    "when the coulomb interaction becomes large , electrons tend to occupy the same spin state to avoid the large energy loss by the coulomb interaction even though the kinetic energy becomes large . in the perfect ferromagnetic state",
    ", the model reduces to the single - orbital hubbard model at half - filling with coulomb interaction @xmath50 if we regard the spin of the single - orbital hubbard model as orbital .",
    "thus , in the perfect ferromagnetic state , orbital - af order occurs to reduce energy .",
    "the obtained critical value @xmath51 from the disordered state to the ferromagnetic state is not so large .",
    "if we do not consider the orbital order , @xmath51 becomes larger .",
    "the critical value @xmath51 increases as @xmath16 is increased . by increasing @xmath16 ,",
    "the effective interaction @xmath52 between different orbitals becomes weak , and a larger value of the coulomb interaction is necessary for the appearance of the ferromagnetic state .    although we have also calculated energy for the purely af - orbital state with @xmath40 and for partial ferromagnetic states , e.g. , @xmath39 shown in figure  [ fig ] , with and without af - orbital order , energy for them does not become the lowest .",
    "this fact indicates that the ferromagnetism and the af - orbital order stabilize each other and occur simultaneously in the ground state at quarter - filling . note that the absence of a partial ferromagnetic state at quarter - filling has also been found in one dimension  @xcite and in infinite dimensions  @xcite",
    "we have studied ground state of the two - orbital hubbard model on a square lattice at quarter - filling within the variational wave functions . for the variational wave functions , we have considered gutzwiller projected functions of spin and/or orbital ordered states .",
    "we have found that in the strong coupling region , the ground state is the perfect ferromagnetic state with af - orbital order . in the weak coupling region ,",
    "the ground state is the disordered state .",
    "we have also found that , at quarter - filling , other states do not become the ground state even in the intermediate coupling region .",
