    "most solid properties depend on the electron behavior , and one of the fundamental issues in solid state physics is the understanding of how electrons roam in crystals . within the independent particle approximation ,",
    "electronic properties are studied considering a model where electrons interact only with the positive ions of the crystal , but each electron remains independent of the others . within this picture ,",
    "insulators are characterized by completely filled bands , otherwise the state is metallic .",
    "the failure of band theory to predict insulating behavior and the role played by correlations due to electron - electron interaction has been subject to intense research starting from the early work of mott @xcite .    in the limit where the positive charge of the ions in the crystal is smeared out uniformly through the whole system , electronic correlations are separated from crystal field effects . in this so called jellium model of a solid ,",
    "the electrons interact with each others via the coulomb interaction ( @xmath0 ) and global electroneutrality is insured by a uniform positive charge background . despite its simplicity , this model is directly relevant in a few cases , for example solid sodium @xcite",
    ".    the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation where electron - electron interactions are replaced by a simple self - consistent field provides a first step to go beyond the independent electron approximation @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting hartree - fock equations are non - local and non - linear .",
    "even for the homogeneous electron gas model , the quantitative determination of the ground state phase diagram  which depends only on density  has been a challenging task@xcite ; large part of the hf phase diagram in three dimensions has been established only recently @xcite .",
    "two possible phases of jellium have been widely investigated : the fermi gas ( fg ) , where electrons are completely delocalized and form a uniform negative charge distribution , and the wigner crystal ( wc ) where electrons are organized on a lattice . at high densities the kinetic energy dominates so the fg is believed to be the ground state , and for low densities , the long - range interaction makes electrons form the wc .    however , already wigner argued that the unpolarized fg is unstable even for high densities@xcite .",
    "later , overhauser@xcite showed the instability of the unpolarized fg with respect to spin - density waves ( sdw ) within hf .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", we have established the ground state phase diagram considering periodic states , which , besides the wc , also include the possibility of incommensurate crystals ( ic ) where the number of maxima in the charge ( or spin ) density is larger than the number of electrons . at high density",
    "these calculations confirmed the fg instability with respect to ic . in this paper , we provide a more complete description of both the method and the results .",
    "in particular , we focus on the physical properties of the hf states and on the universality of the results at high density giving further evidence for the sdw character of the high density ground state .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec - model ] , we describe the model and introduce the basic definitions .",

    "we search for a lattice @xmath20 and a density matrix @xmath26 such that the number of particle per unit cell is near @xmath43 ( or some multiple of @xmath43 for non - bravais lattices ) . for extremal states , the eigenvalues of @xmath26 must be exactly @xmath44 or @xmath42 , the number of strictly positive eigenvalues is not known a priori but is expected to fall between 0 and @xmath45 ( or some multiple of @xmath45 for non - bravais lattices ) .    in practice , the first @xmath46 @xmath47-vectors in @xmath20 are used ( see table [ tab - lattice ] ) .",
