    "a common feature of the aforementioned algorithms is that they require a large - size linear system to be solved at each iteration .",
    "when non tight frame representations are used , the computational cost of the associated inversion may become prohibitive .",
    "we will see however that for the class of frames introduced in section [ sec : frames ] , this inversion can be performed in an efficient manner .",
