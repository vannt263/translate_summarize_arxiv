    "this event is rapidly followed by several other multiple fragmentation events until a stationary droplet dispersion is attained . in the final stages the droplets continuously undergo deformation , break - up , and coagulation . here",

    "the ratio between the two gives the weber number estimated on the droplet diameter : @xmath7 the maximum stable _ mean _ droplet diameter can be estimated by assuming k41 turbulent statistics for velocity increments : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy dissipation . from the condition of weber number order unity , one obtains : @xmath10 corrections to finite viscosity of the dispersed phase can also be added @xcite .",
    "the present simulation allows to study droplets breakup conditions e.g. testing the kolmogorov - hinze criteria at changing the reynolds number and the viscosity ratio between the dispersed and continuos phase . specifically it is also possible to study the fluctuactions around the mean average stable droplet radius ( [ kh ] ) induced by intermittent fluctuations of the velocity field .    in the movie various stages of droplet breakup process",

    "the parameter used in our simulation are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "we start the simulation with the fluid at rest and all the droplet volume fraction residing into a large , single spherical droplet . from the beginning of simulation ,",
    "the large scale stirring start to be applied and the turbulence level grows continuosly during roughly one large scale eddy turnover time . in the initial phase the large drop gets mildly deformed , then stretched , and finally broken into smaller droplets ( see figure [ gialla ] ) . at this point",
    "the fragmentations process continues for about another @xmath11 eddy turn over times .",
    "after this period the distribution of droplets is almost stationary and is characterized by continuos coagulation , deformation and breakups events due to the continuous presence of underlying turbulent fluctuactions .",
