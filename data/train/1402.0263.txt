    "2d metal dichalcogenides are the large exciton and trion binding energies in these materials .",
    "the exciton and trion binding energies in 2d chalcogenides are almost an order of magnitude larger compared to other bulk semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the large exciton and trion binding energies imply that many body interactions play an important role in determining the electronic and optical properties of these materials .",
    "energy bandstructures , including exciton wavefunctions and binding energies , and optical absorption spectra for these materials have been obtained using a variety of different theoretical techniques including ab - initio calculations @xcite .",
    "the question that remains to be answered is how well the calculated exciton and trion binding energies and wavefunctions agree with experiments and what essential physics has to be included in the models to obtain good quantitative agreements with measurements .",

    ", we measure the absorption spectra of excitons and trions ( in transmission configuration ) in monolayers of a dichalcogenide ( mos@xmath0 ) and use it to extract information about the exciton and trion radii , optical oscillator strengths , and binding energies .",
    "our work shows that the traditional wannier - mott exciton model @xcite , with a few modifications , is able to describe the exciton fairly well in 2d dichalcogenides .",
    "the modifications involve using accurate bandstructures of conduction and valence bands for large wavevectors , incorporating phase space blocking due to pauli exclusion in doped samples , and using a wavevector dependent dielectric constant that takes into account the finite thickness of dichalcogenide monolayers .",
    "accurate bandstructures are required for large wavevectors because exciton and trion radii in dichalcogenides are of the order of @xmath2 and , therefore , the exciton and trion relative wavefunctions in the wavevector ( or momentum ) space spread out to large wavevectors .",
    "the small exciton and trion radii also imply that just the bandedge optical matrix elements can not be used to obtain accurate exciton and trion optical absorption spectra , and matrix elements for large wavevectors are required .",
    "we show that with these modifications the measured exciton and trion optical absorption spectra ( and optical conductivity values ) agree well with the theory .",
    "measurment of the optical absorption spectra and oscillator strengths can be used to estimate the exciton and trion radii and , to the best of our knowledge , this paper reports experimental estimates for the exciton and trion radii in a dichalcogenide for the first time .",
    "our work also shows that the exciton and trion binding energies that follow from the experimentally determined exciton and trion radii agree well with the results obtained previously from first principles calculations .",
