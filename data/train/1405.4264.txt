    "raman spectroscopy is one of the most used characterization techniques in carbon science and technology@xcite .",
    "the measurement of the raman spectrum of graphene@xcite triggered a huge effort to understand phonons , electron - phonon , magneto - phonon and electron - electron interactions in graphene , as well as the influence of the number and orientation of layers , electric or magnetic fields , strain , doping , disorder , quality and types of edges , and functional groups@xcite .",
    "quantifying defects in graphene is crucial both to gain insight in fundamental properties , and for applications . ref . introduced a three - stage classification of disorder , leading from graphite to amorphous carbons , that allows to simply assess all the raman spectra of carbons : stage 1 ) graphene to nanocrystalline graphene ; stage 2 ) nanocrystalline graphene to low-@xmath0 amorphous carbon ; stage 3 ) low-@xmath0 amorphous carbon to high-@xmath0 amorphous carbon . here",
    "we focus on stage 1 , the most relevant when considering the vast majority of publications dealing with graphene production , processing and applications . in stage 1",
    "the raman spectrum evolves as follows@xcite : a ) d appears and the ratio of the d and g peak intensities , i(d)/i(g ) , increases ; b ) d appears ; c ) all peaks broaden ; e ) the d+d peak appears ; f ) at the end of stage 1 , g and d are so wide that is sometimes more convenient to consider them as a single , up - shifted , wide g band at@xmath1 .    in their seminal work , tuinstra and",
    "koenig noted that i(d)/i(g ) varied inversely with the crystal size , @xmath2 : i(d)/i(g)=@xmath3 , where @xmath4@xcite ( @xmath5 being the excitation wavelength ) .",
    "initially , this was interpreted in terms of phonon confinement : the intensity of the forbidden process would be ruled by the `` amount of lifting '' of the selection rule@xcite , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "now , it is understood theoretically and established experimentally , that the d peak is produced only in a small region of the crystal ( size @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fermi velocity and @xmath10 is the phonon frequency ) near a defect or an edge@xcite . for a nanocrystallite , i(g )",
    "is proportional to the sample area,@xmath11 , while i(d ) is proportional to the overall length of the edge , which scales as@xmath12 .",
    "thus , i(d)/i(g)@xmath13 . for a sample with rare defects , i(d )",
    "is proportional to the total number of defects probed by the laser spot .",
    "thus , for an average interdefect distance @xmath14 , and laser spot size @xmath15 , there are on average @xmath16 defects in the area probed by the laser , then i(d)@xmath17 . on the other hand , i(g ) is proportional to the total area probed by the laser @xmath18 , thus i(d)/i(g)=@xmath19 . for very small @xmath14 , one must have @xmath20i(d)/i(g)@xmath21 .",
    "this condition gives an estimate of @xmath22 .",
    "ref . measured",
    "i(d)/i(g ) for irradiated single layer graphene ( slg ) with known @xmath14 , derived from stm measurements , obtaining i(d)/i(g)@xmath23 at 514  nm excitation , in excellent agreement with this simple estimate .    ref . then considered the excitation energy dependence of the peaks areas and intensities , for visible excitation energy .",
    "a fit to the experimental data gave the relation@xcite : @xmath24^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the laser excitation energy .",
    "by considering point - like defects , separated from each other by @xmath14[nm ] , eq.1 can be restated in terms of defect density @xmath26(@xmath27)=10@xmath28/@xmath29$]@xcite : @xmath30 note that these relations are limited to raman - active defects .",
    "perfect zigzag edges@xcite , charged impurities@xcite , intercalants@xcite , uniaxial and biaxial strain@xcite do not generate a d peak . for these types of `` silent '' defects ,",
    "other raman signatures can be used .",
    "a perfect edge does change the g peak shape@xcite , while strain , intercalants , and charged impurities have a strong influence on the g and 2d peaks@xcite . in this case , the combination of raman spectroscopy with other independent probes of the number of defects can provide a wealth of information on the nature of such defects .",
    "we note as well that these relations are derived assuming negligible fermi level , @xmath31 , shift .",
    "it is known that doping has major effects on the raman spectra@xcite .",
    "the g peak position , pos(g ) , increases and its full width at half maximum , fwhm(g ) , decreases for both electron ( @xmath32 ) and hole ( @xmath33 ) doping .",
    "the g peak stiffening is due to the non - adiabatic removal of the kohn anomaly at the brillouin zone ( bz ) centre , @xmath34@xcite . the fwhm(g",
    ") sharpening is due to pauli blocking of phonon decay into @xmath35 pairs when the @xmath35 gap is higher than the phonon energy@xcite , and saturates for @xmath31 bigger than half phonon energy@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in slg the ratio of the heights of the 2d and g peaks , i(2d)/i(g ) , and their areas , a(2d)/a(g ) , is maximum for zero doping@xcite , and decreases for increasing doping .",
    "the doping dependence of the 2d intensity results from its sensitivity to the scattering of the photoexcited @xmath32 and @xmath33 . assuming the dominant sources of scattering to be phonon emission and @xmath36 collisions , ref",
    ". showed that , while the former is not sensitive to doping , the latter is .",
    "then , the doping dependence of the 2d peak can be used to estimate the corresponding electron - phonon coupling@xcite .",
    "these considerations apply for @xmath37 small compared to @xmath38 ( @xmath39 being the angular frequency of the incident photon ) . in the past few years ,",
    "much higher doping levels have been achieved@xcite .",
    "one of the effects of high doping is the increase in i(g ) .",
    "doping changes the occupations of electronic states and , since transitions from an empty state or to a filled state are impossible , it can exclude some bz regions from contributing to the raman matrix element . due to suppression of destructive interference , this leads to an enhancement of the g peak when @xmath37 matches @xmath38 , as predicted theoretically@xcite and observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "another effect of high doping is on the 2d peak , which is suppressed when the conduction band becomes filled at the energy probed by the laser@xcite .",
    "there are three cases : ( i ) when @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the angular frequency of the emitted photon ) , all processes are allowed and the 2d band is observed , ( ii ) when @xmath42 , the photon absorption is allowed but the phonon emission is excluded by pauli blocking ; ( iii ) when @xmath43 , both photon absorption and phonon emission are blocked .",
    "therefore , only when @xmath44 , the 2d band is observable .",
    "while a significant effort was devoted to understand the effect of defects in samples with negligible doping@xcite , and the effect of doping in samples with negligible defects@xcite , the combined effect of doping and defects on the raman spectrum of slg has received little attention . however , most samples produced by either micromechanical exfoliation , chemical vapor deposition , liquid phase exfoliation or carbon segregation from sic or metal substrates are naturally doped due to the extreme sensitivity of graphene to the presence of adsorbates ( e.g. moisture ) and to the interaction with the underlying substrate@xcite .",
    "additionally , many of them also have defects , or defects may appear during processing for device integration .",
    "it is thus critical to understand if and how defects can be detected and quantified by raman spectroscopy in doped samples .",
    "here we study the dependence of the raman spectrum of defected slg on the level of electrostatic doping , in samples with a fixed amount of defects .",
    "we combine polymer electrolyte gating@xcite with _ in situ _ hall - effect measurements and raman spectroscopy at different excitation wavelengths .",
    "this allows us to vary @xmath31 from @xmath45ev ( @xmath46doping ) up to @xmath47ev ( @xmath48doping ) , a much wider span than what can be achieved by the common 300 nm sio@xmath49back gate ( usually restricted to @xmath50 because of the limited gate capacitance@xcite ) and large enough to cover the range of doping found in the vast majority of papers in literature .",
    "this range is however smaller than @xmath38 to exclude additional effects due to pauli blocking on the peaks intensities , again consistent with the case in most papers .",
    "we find that the intensity of defect - related peaks , d and d , strongly decreases with @xmath31 .",
    "we assign this to increased broadening of the electronic states due to increased @xmath36 scattering for higher doping .",
    "we then modify eqs.(1,[eq14 ] ) and give general relations between d peak intensity and defects valid for any doping level .",
    "the defected samples are prepared as follows .",
    "a slg film is grown by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) on a 25@xmath51 m copper foil@xcite .",
    "it is then transferred on a si+300 nm sio@xmath49 substrate as described in refs .. the hall bar geometry is defined by creating a photoresist ( pr ) mask by photo - lithography and removing the uncovered portion of the film by o@xmath49/ar reactive ion etching . a further pr layer is then spun on the sample and windows are opened by photolithography only on the graphene channel and side - gate area ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the pr mask is then hard - baked at 145@xmath52c for 5 minutes in order to improve its chemical stability@xcite .",
    "the devices are then exposed to a mild o@xmath49 inductively coupled plasma to introduce defects in the graphene channel@xcite .",
    "the process is carried out at a pressure@xmath53150mtorr , with a power of 15w and for a few seconds ( typically between 2 and 10s ) depending on the desired defect concentration .",

    "the working principle of this gating technique is shown schematically in fig.[fig1](a , b ) .",
    "when a potential is applied between the side - gate and the graphene channel , free ions migrate and accumulate at the surface of the electrodes to form an electric double layer ( edl ) . due to the large interfacial capacitance of the edl , the compensation of these charges shifts @xmath31 , much more than what can be achieved with standard dielectric gates@xcite . in the case of standard dielectric - gating",
    ", the applied gate potential uniformly drops across the gate dielectric and it is therefore possible to directly estimate the induced charge through a capacitor model@xcite . in a polymer - electrolyte gated field - effect transistor , the applied gate potential drops across two nano - capacitors in series ( one at the side - gate / electrolyte interface , the other at the electrolyte / channel interface ) , separated by an ionic conductive medium . in order to maximize the voltage drop across the channel / electrolyte interface , the side - gate / electrolyte capacitance must be the dominant one , hence the area of the gate electrode is significantly larger than that of the graphene channel , and a pr mask is fabricated on top of the device in order to minimize the direct contact area between metal electrodes and polymer electrolyte , thus reducing parasitic capacitance . despite this ,",
    "a voltage drop at the gate electrode can not be excluded , and might lead to errors when correlating the applied gate voltage to the amount of induced charges in the graphene channel and @xmath31@xcite . to avoid possible systematic errors , @xmath31 in the graphene channel is directly evaluated by hall - effect measurements . a 1@xmath51a direct current ( dc )",
    "is applied between source and drain leads using a keithley 2410 source - measurement unit , while longitudinal and transverse voltages ( v@xmath56 and v@xmath57 ) are measured by means of a keithley 2182a nanovoltmeter .",
    "the perpendicular magnetic field is applied using a permanent magnet with a surface field of 0.37 t , as measured using a calibrated gauss - meter .",
    "another keithley 2410 is used to apply the gate voltage , @xmath58 .",
    "the overall performance of polymer - electrolyte gating is limited by the electrochemical stability of the polymer - electrolyte .",
    "when a @xmath58 higher than the electrochemical stability window of the polymer electrolyte is applied , electrochemical reactions , such as hydrolysis of residual water in the electrolyte@xcite , can occur and permanently modify the graphene electrode , thus changing the total amount of defects . in order to avoid this , the maximum applied @xmath58 is@xmath59v and the gate leakage current , a good indication of possible electrochemical reactions@xcite , is monitored and kept at@xmath5310@xmath60a .",

    "as @xmath31 moves from the charge neutrality point , the g peak blue - shifts and narrows , consistent with what reported in pristine graphene in presence of moderate electrostatic doping@xcite with @xmath63 .",
    "the hardening of the g mode is due to nonadiabatic removal of a kohn anomaly at @xmath34@xcite , and the reduction of width is due to pauli exclusion principle inhibiting phonon decay into @xmath35 pairs when @xmath31 surpasses half the phonon energy@xcite .",
    "fig.[fig2p5b ] shows the doping dependence of the intensity and area ratio of 2d and g. both decrease with increasing @xmath31 due to the effect of increased @xmath36 interaction@xcite .",
    "a(g ) remains roughly constant with @xmath31@xcite ( for @xmath63 ) , while i(g ) is reduced close to the charge neutrality point due to the damping of the phonon decaying into @xmath35 pairs which increases fwhm(g ) .",

    "fig.[fig2 ] plots the raman spectra of sample a as a function of doping .",

    "in absence of external means to derive @xmath31 , one could use raman spectroscopy to evaluate @xmath31 .",
    "since pos(g ) , fwhm(g ) , pos(2d ) and i(2d)/(g ) for defected graphene within stage 1 evolve consistently with what reported for non defective samples@xcite , one can use these to estimate @xmath73100mev in case a ) and @xmath72500mev in case b ) . comparing pos(2d ) with pos(g ) and using fig.[fig2p5c]b , it is possible to conclude that the sample is @xmath46doped . since i(d)/i(g)@xmath531.24 at 633 nm , if we ignore doping and use eqs.([eq14],1 ) we get @xmath74@xmath27 or @xmath75 nm .",
    "eqs.([nd2],3 ) instead give @xmath76@xmath27 or @xmath77 nm . the defect density estimated taking into account doping is more than twice that from eq.[eq14 ] . this can make a difference for the optimization of methods of production and processing of graphene , especially for what concerns particular applications , such as transparent conductive films , where low sheet resistance may be achieved through high doping@xcite .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "reported a doping dependence of i(d ) , which was found to sharply increase for @xmath78 .",
    "this was assigned to quantum interference between different raman pathways , similarly to the case of the g peak in refs .. however , ref .",
    "suffers from poor accuracy in the determination of the charge carriers concentration , leading to results inconsistent with literature@xcite . indeed , in ref .",
    "the graphene raman peaks are found to evolve with doping as in ref . , but at doping levels almost one order of magnitude higher .",
    "e.g. , pos(2d)@xmath79 for @xmath80 is reached in ref . for @xmath81 while in ref .",
    "is observed for @xmath82 .",
    "the inconsistency of ref . is evident also in the analysis of the doping dependence of pos(g ) .",
    "ref . reported for pristine graphene @xmath83 for @xmath48doping and @xmath84 for @xmath46doping , as also confirmed by ref . and",
    "our present work , where we obtain @xmath83 for @xmath48doping and @xmath85 for @xmath46doping ( see fig.[fig2p5a ] ) .",
    "ref . has a much weaker doping dependence of pos(g ) , in particular @xmath86 for @xmath48doping and @xmath87 for @xmath46doping .",
    "this indicates that the actual doping level reached by ref .",
    "is much smaller than what claimed and surely far from @xmath88 necessary to achieve the blocking of raman pathways@xcite for @xmath5=514.5  nm ( as used in ref . ) , thus compromising the basis of their physical explanation for the observed increase of i(d ) .    ref .",
    "reported the i(d ) dependence on back - gate bias in slg , observing an increase in i(d)/i(g ) with increasing gate voltage , in principle the opposite of what we report here in fig.[fig3]a . ref . attributed this to a change in the total amount of defects in graphene due to electrochemical reactions involving the water layer trapped at the interface between graphene and the silicon dioxide substrate .",
    "this is quite a different case with respect to that studied here , where the number of defects is kept constant as a function of doping , as confirmed by the repeatability of the raman measurements through several gate voltage sweeps .    in order to understand the physical reason for the d peak decrease with @xmath31 reported in fig.[fig2 ] , we consider the raman scattering processes in more detail .",

    "it comes from to phonons around the bz edge * * k**@xcite , is active by double resonance ( dr)@xcite , and is strongly dispersive with excitation energy@xcite , due to a kohn anomaly at * * k**@xcite .",
    "dr can also happen as intra - valley process , i.e. connecting two points belonging to the same cone around @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 ) .",
    "this gives the d peak .",
    "the 2d peak is the d peak overtone .",
    "the 2d peak is the d overtone . since 2d and 2d originate from a process where momentum conservation is satisfied by two phonons with opposite wavevectors , no defects are required for their activation , and are thus always present@xcite .",
    "the raman spectra can be modeled within second - order perturbation theory , by summing over all scattering pathways , expressed with the fermi s golden rule to the fourth order@xcite .",
    "each of these pathways consists of the creation of an @xmath35 pair due to the interaction with incident excitation laser , one @xmath92 and one electron - defect ( @xmath93 ) scattering , and the @xmath35 pair recombination@xcite .",

    "there are eight different contributions for each k - point in the bz .",

    ", this value has never been determined experimentally .",
    "the defect - related broadening depends on the number of defects and also the type of defects .",
    "note that there is a difference of a factor of 4 between the definition of @xmath129 of ref . and",
    "that used here , chosen to be consistent with the notation in ref ..    fig.[fig7 ] plots the doping dependence of a(d)/a(g ) , a(2d)/a(g ) and a(d)/a(2d ) for sample a , normalized with respect to their values at low doping .",
    "the area of the g peak is constant with doping for @xmath130@xcite , therefore the dependencies of a(d)/a(g ) and a(2d)/a(g ) with doping are representative of the a(d ) and a(2d ) trend , respectively .",
    "the agreement between experiment and theory is remarkable given the simple description of the doping in the simulation .",
    "the increase of the total broadening due to @xmath112 , as described in ref .",
    ", can well reproduce the trend of the decrease of the peaks areas , strongly indicating that @xmath36 correlation is likely to be the most relevant cause for the observed experimental trends . as the concentration of charge carriers",
    "is increased , some of the other ingredients of the model , such as electron and phonon dispersions , might change . with doping , the graphene lattice parameter is expected to change , leading to a shift in the adiabatic energy of the phonon modes@xcite .",
    "this changes the position of the raman peaks , but should not significantly alter their intensity .",
    "the @xmath92 matrix elements are also expected to decrease slightly with increasing doping , @xmath5315% for the doping range probed in this experiment@xcite , thus representing a correction to our analysis .",
    "more detailed studies are required to fully understand the interplay between the different effects .",
    "we studied the dependence of raman spectrum of defected graphene on the charge carrier concentration , by combining polymer electrolyte gating with _ in situ _ hall - effect and raman measurements . for a given number of defects , the intensities and areas of the d and d peaks",
    "decrease with increasing doping . considering all scattering processes within the dr framework",
    ", we interpret the doping - induced intensity variation as due to an increased total scattering rate of the photoexcited electrons and holes , resulting from the doping - dependent strength of electron - electron scattering .",
    "this analysis paves the way for the experimental evaluation of the different sources of broadening in the electronic states in graphene and a better understanding of the role and type of defects on its physical properties .",
    "this study highlights the importance of taking into account the doping level when determining the amount and the type of defects from the intensity of the d - peak .",
