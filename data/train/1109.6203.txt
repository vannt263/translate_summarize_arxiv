    "during the last decades , researchers have learned to gain ever better control over the internal degrees of freedom and the translational motion of molecules , and a wide variety of molecules have been trapped by now in electric , magnetic or optical fields .",

    "cooling and trapping of pre - existing molecules often involves highly reactive species that are produced , for instance , via laser ablation or photodissociation of a precursor molecule . the production efficiency of such radical species limits the absolute number and the number density that can be reached for trapped samples . in a cooling and trapping experiment",
    ", one would ideally like to use a stable molecule that is available in a bottle at high vapor pressure .",
    "among all the molecules that have been trapped so far , only ammonia @xcite , carbon monoxide @xcite and molecular hydrogen @xcite fall in this category .",
    "however , the various symmetric top isotopologues of ammonia that have been trapped have a rather complicated energy - level structure due to the presence of four atoms with nonzero nuclear spin .",
    "even the simplest isotopologue , @xmath5nh@xmath6 , has its population distributed over 12 @xmath7m@xmath8 components when it is trapped in its electronic , vibrational , and rotational ground state by means of electric fields .",
    "the co molecules have thus far only been trapped in their metastable a@xmath9 state . in this open - shell electronically excited state ,",
    "electrostatic trapping is possible by virtue of the electric dipole moment of @xmath101.37 d together with the first - order stark interaction , but phosphorescence back to the ground state limits the trapping time to the millisecond range @xcite .",
    "similarly , h@xmath11 molecules have thus far only been trapped in short - lived rydberg states @xcite    carbon monoxide in its electronic , vibrational and rotational ground state ( x@xmath0 ,  @xmath1=0 ,  @xmath2=0 ) is in many ways an ideal candidate for trapping experiments .",
    "the six stable co isotopologues combining @xmath12c or @xmath13c with @xmath14o , @xmath15o or @xmath16o are all commercially available .",
    "the most abundant isotopologue @xmath12c@xmath14o is a boson with no nuclear spin .",
    "the nondegenerate @xmath2=0 level is separated by almost 4 @xmath17 from the next , @xmath2=1 , level .",
    "contrary to the case of many diatomic hydrides @xcite , co is quite immune to blackbody radiation ; even at room temperature , the rate at which the molecules are optically pumped out of the @xmath2=0 level by blackbody radiation is below 10@xmath18 s@xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath12c@xmath16o isotopologue is also a boson with no nuclear spin , while @xmath13c@xmath14o and @xmath13c@xmath16o are fermions with an @xmath20=1/2 ground level ( @xmath21 with @xmath22 the nuclear spin ) , which remains a single ( doubly degenerate ) level in the presence of an electric field .",
    "ground - state co molecules can in principle be trapped in an ac electric field trap or in an optical trap , although it is an experimental challenge to make a trap with a significant depth .",
    "the lowest rotational levels of the electronic ground state of co have a purely quadratic stark shift in electric fields that can be realized in the laboratory .",
    "the main contribution to the stark shift is due to the electric dipole moment of @xmath230.1098 d @xcite , although the isotropic polarizability of the ground state @xcite can not be neglected .",
    "note that we use here the convention that a positive sign of the dipole moment corresponds to the situation c@xmath24o@xmath25 , _ i.e. _ , in the ground - state the situation is c@xmath25o@xmath24 .",

    "it is interesting to note that the acceleration experienced in electric fields by the co molecules in the @xmath2=0 level is almost identical to that experienced by ground - state @xmath26rb atoms .",
    "therefore , the performance of an ac electric trap for ground - state co molecules will be very similar to that of an ac electric trap for ground - state @xmath26rb atoms .",
    "the latter trap has been demonstrated @xcite and carefully characterized @xcite before , from which it is concluded that ac electric traps with a depth of tens of micro - kelvin can be made for ground - state co molecules .    in the following sections , we outline and demonstrate a scheme via which the required translationally cold samples of ground - state co molecules can be produced",
    "a high density of co molecules is obtained in a pulsed beam , _",
    "e.g. _ when a mixture of co in a rare gas carrier is expanded through a pulsed valve from high pressure into vacuum . in such a beam , a large fraction of all the co molecules will be in the @xmath1=0 and @xmath2=0 level of the electronic ground state .",
    "even though the vapor pressure of co allows the pulsed valve to be cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures , the speed of the molecules in the beam will be several hundred m / s .",
    "deceleration of the co molecules can be performed very efficiently when the molecules are first transferred to the metastable a@xmath9 state .",
    "pulsed laser excitation around 206 nm is used in the expansion region of the molecular beam to saturate the spin - forbidden transition to the metastable state .",
    "molecules in the @xmath27=1 level of the a@xmath3 , @xmath28=0 state can be decelerated to arbitrarily low velocities ; this has actually been used in the first demonstrations of various types of stark decelerators thus far @xcite .",
    "after the metastable co molecules have been brought to a standstill , they can be dumped back to the x@xmath0 ,  @xmath1=0 ,  @xmath2=0 level via stimulated emission pumping , thus producing the required translationally cold ground - state molecules .",
    "preferably , there should be dissipation in the process of returning to the ground state , such that the phase - space density can be increased by accumulating molecules from subsequent cycles @xcite .",
    "although the phosphorescence back to the electronic ground state could in principle be exploited for this , its millisecond time scale makes this impractical .",
    "it is shown here that it is possible to optically pump the co molecules from the a@xmath9 state to perturbed levels in the a@xmath4 state , and to use the fast spontaneous emission on the a@xmath4 @xmath29 x@xmath0 transition to populate the ground - state level , as schematically shown in fig .",

    "this transfer efficiency only holds when the parity of all the levels involved in the scheme is well defined . in an electric field",

    "it turns out that in this case the observed intensities can not only be used to determine the sign of the dipole moment , but also to unambiguously establish that the upper ( lower ) @xmath34-doublet component of the @xmath30=2 level in the a@xmath4 , @xmath31=1 state has negative ( positive ) parity . only in this case the observed intensity pattern is quantitatively reproduced and , in particular , the factor two intensity difference in the strength of the transition to the @xmath63 = @xmath232 component compared to the transition to the @xmath63 = @xmath231 component is obtained . from a fit of the observed stark shifted patterns ,",
    "a value of the @xmath34-doublet splitting between the parity levels under field - free conditions of 18 @xmath68 3 mhz is obtained .",
    "the electric dipole moment in the @xmath30=2 level of the a@xmath4 , @xmath31=1 state is determined to be @xmath10(0.29@xmath680.02 ) d.",
    "in this paper , we have outlined and demonstrated an experimental scheme to produce samples of translationally cold co molecules in their absolute ground - state level .",
    "the scheme is based on the use of the remarkably efficient unidirectional optical transfer from the metastable a@xmath9 state to the @xmath76=0 level in the x@xmath0 , @xmath1=0 state _ via _ the @xmath30=1 level in the perturbed d@xmath32 , @xmath31=5 //",
    "a@xmath4 , @xmath31=1 system .",
    "the radiative lifetime of the @xmath30=1 level in the ( nominally ) d@xmath32 , @xmath31=5 state is indeed seen to be as short as 55 @xmath68 4 ns due to the coupling with the singlet state .",
    "fluorescence from this rotational level in the triplet manifold will end up in the singlet manifold , in particular in the x@xmath0 electronic ground state , with a quantum efficiency that is very close to unity ( about 0.99 ) .",
    "the transition to this level from the metastable state can be efficiently induced by a cw laser ; in the present experiments about 300  mw of narrowband 563 nm laser radiation in a two millimeter diameter beam has been used to drive this transition .",
    "as the manipulation of the translational motion of the metastable co molecules relies on their interaction with electric fields , it is important to know the dipole moments of the intermediate levels in the optical transfer scheme as well . the dipole moment of the @xmath30=1 level in the d@xmath32 , @xmath31=5 state is found to be @xmath23(0.23@xmath680.01 ) d. the dipole moment in the perturbing a@xmath4 , @xmath31=1 state has the opposite sign ; for the @xmath30=2 level it is found to be @xmath10(0.29@xmath680.02 ) d. from a detailed analysis of the perturbation between these states , it is known that the amount of @xmath4 character in the wavefunction of the d@xmath32 , @xmath31=5 , @xmath30=1 level is 17% whereas in the wavefunction of the @xmath30=2 level in the a@xmath4 , @xmath31=1 state it is 84.3% @xcite .",
    "the deperturbed value of the dipole moment of the d@xmath45 , @xmath31=5 state can then be calculated as @xmath23(0.36@xmath680.02 ) d , whereas the deperturbed value for the a@xmath4 , @xmath31=1 state results in @xmath10(0.41@xmath680.03 ) d. the first value falls nicely in between the values found for the adjacent ( unperturbed ) vibrational levels of the d@xmath45 state @xcite .",
    "the deperturbed value of the dipole moment for the @xmath31=1 level in the a@xmath4 state is somewhat higher than the value of @xmath10(0.335 @xmath68 0.013 ) d that has been found for the @xmath31=0 level @xcite .",
    "a slight increase of the permanent electric dipole moment with increasing vibrational quantum number is indeed expected from the calculated dipole moment function for the a@xmath4 state @xcite .",
