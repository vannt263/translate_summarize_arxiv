    "the one - loop scattering amplitude for six - gluons in pure qcd has been an interesting test case for the development of analytic techniques in perturbative gauge theories .",
    "the amplitude can be decomposed into various subamplitudes which were calculated between 1993 and 2006  @xcite in thirteen different publications by 23 authors .",
    "the results for the amplitude are spread across a large number of papers .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to bring as many of these as practical together in a common source with a reasonably consistent notation .",

    "we will try to show how these specialise to the six gluon case and give the six - gluon case explicitly .",

    "the contributions with fundamental representation quarks can be obtained from the same partial amplitudes , except that sum runs only over the @xmath12 and the overall factor of @xmath6 in @xmath13 is dropped . for one - loop amplitudes of gluons the @xmath14 , @xmath15 can be obtained from the @xmath12 by summing over permutations  @xcite .",
    "hence it is suffice to compute @xmath12 in what follows .",
    "the partial amplitudes @xmath12 have cyclic symmetry rather than full crossing symmetry    the amplitudes are also organised according to the helicity of the outgoing gluon which may be @xmath16 .",
    "we use polarisation tensors formed from weyl spinors  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gluon momentum and @xmath19 is an arbitrary null ` reference momentum ' which drops out of final gauge - invariant amplitudes .",

    "consequently , up to conjugation and relabeling , there are eight independent helicity color ordered amplitudes for the six - gluon amplitude as given in table  1 . of these amplitudes",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 have the simplest one - loop structure : a consequence that the tree partial amplitudes vanish .",
    "in fact , these amplitudes vanish to all orders in perturbation theory within any supersymmetry theory . amplitudes with exactly two negative helicities are referred to as mhv ( `` maximally helicity violating '' ) amplitudes and those with three negative helicities as nmhv ( `` next to mhv '' ) amplitudes .",
