    "amit and linial introduced random lifts of graphs in @xcite and studied their connectivity properties .",
    "properties of these graphs have been widely researched since their work . recall that a random @xmath2-lift , @xmath4 , of a graph @xmath5 is constructed in the following way : arbitrarily orient the edges of @xmath5 and assign a permutation from the symmetric group , @xmath6 , to every edge of @xmath5 uniformly at random .",
    "the vertices of @xmath4 are @xmath7 where @xmath8 $ ] for every @xmath9 and @xmath10 is connected to @xmath11 if and only if there is an edge @xmath12 connecting @xmath13 to @xmath14 in @xmath5 , and this edge was assigned a permutation @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "the edges of @xmath4 are unoriented .",
    "we call @xmath2 the degree of the lift and @xmath5 the base graph .",
    "the @xmath2 vertices @xmath7 of @xmath4 form the fiber of @xmath9 . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath12 connects @xmath13 to @xmath14 in @xmath5 , and it is assigned the permutation @xmath15 in the construction of @xmath4 , then the @xmath2 edges connecting @xmath10 to @xmath17 form the fiber of @xmath12 .    if @xmath5 has parallel edges or loops , then we simply assign each parallel edge or loop a random permutation and construct a random lift in the same way .",
    "lifts of graphs cover the base graph in the sense of covering spaces in topology , and there is a surjective @xmath2 to @xmath18 graph homomorphism , or covering homomorphism , from an @xmath2-lift of @xmath5 to @xmath5 .",
    "one can also show that any walk in @xmath5 starting at @xmath13 is covered by @xmath2 edge - disjoint walks in any @xmath2-lift of @xmath5 ( formally , each of these is a preimage of the walk in the covering homomorphism ) , one starting at each point in the fiber of @xmath13 , this is known as the walk - lifting property .",
    "we study connectivity properties of random lifts and some of our proofs are inspired by the work of @xcite and @xcite , but we use ideas from group theory .",
    "the main theorem in @xcite is that asymptotically almost surely ( with probability going to @xmath18 as @xmath19 ) , a random @xmath2-lift of a simple connected graph with minimum degree @xmath20 is @xmath1-connected .",
    "amit and linial raise the question as to whether this probability can be estimated as a function of @xmath2 and suggest the study of iterated random lifts .",
    "we establish a new relationship between a random @xmath2-lift and a randomly generated subgroup of @xmath6 , which we call the walk - subgroup , and use properties of this subgroup to provide a solution to their question .",
    "we improve a result about the edge expansion of random lifts from @xcite , and show a new bound on the probability of @xmath1-connectivity in @xmath2-lifts of graphs where @xmath1 is not a fixed constant .",
    "our results naturally extend to iterated random lifts .",
    "interestingly , they also show the existence of properties of random lifts whose probability only depends on the homotopy type of the base graph .",
    "the main contribution of this work is methodological and we think that techniques similar to the ones in this paper could find further applications in the study of random lifts .",
    "the necessary preliminaries are presented in section 3 , and the main results are in section 4 . in section 3.1",
    "we define general walk - subgroups .",
    "section 3.23.3 describe random lifts , iterated random lifts and their respective walk - subgroups .",
    "our proof strategy in section 4 is to show that properties of the walk - subgroup imply properties of random lifts , and in section 3.4 we mention results about randomly generated subgroups of @xmath6 which will be useful later .    in section 4.1",
    "we prove results pertaining to connectivity and edge expansion of random lifts .",
    "amit and linial have shown the following .",
    "let @xmath5 be a simple connected graph with minimum degree @xmath21 .",
    "then with probability @xmath22 , a random n - lift of g is @xmath1-connected .",
    "they ask whether this probability can be estimated as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we first compute the probability of connectivity in theorem 4.1 , and then show how to compute a lower bound on the probability of @xmath1-connectivity in theorem 4.7 provided that @xmath23 . in theorem 4.10",
    "we show that if @xmath24 , random @xmath2-lifts of all graphs with @xmath25 vertices are a.a.s .",
    "@xmath1-connected even if we assume that @xmath1 grows slowly as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the edge expansion of random lifts can be lower bounded as a function of the base graph in the following way .",
    "let g be a connected graph with @xmath26 . then there is a positive constant @xmath27 , such that a.a.s .",
    "a random lift of @xmath5 has expansion at least @xmath27 .",
    "we improve this result in theorem 4.5 by showing that a slightly better lower bound holds and explicitly giving its probability .",
    "we also show how to extend our results to iterated random lifts .",
    "the iterated construction of random lifts of random lifts of and so on , has been mentioned in @xcite but no properties of this model were known previously .    in section 4.2",
    "we show the existence of homotopy invariants in random lifts in the following sense : the probability that random lifts of @xmath5 have certain properties ( like connectivity ) depends only on the homotopy type of @xmath5 .",
    "this result in particular extends the current understanding of how random lifts inherit structure from their base graph .    in section 4.3",
    "we generalize a result in @xcite which calculates the probability with which random elements of @xmath6 generate a transitive subgroup of @xmath6 , to the wreath product of symmetric groups .",
    "this result may be of independent interest .",
    "let @xmath28 be a graph and @xmath29 a group . to every edge of @xmath28 associate an element of @xmath29 through a map @xmath30 .",
    "we calculate the walk - product of the walk @xmath31 on h as @xmath32 , where if @xmath33 then @xmath34 .",
    "the subset of @xmath29 which can be produced by walk - products is called the walk - subset of ( h , v ) . in special cases ,",
    "this subset is a subgroup of @xmath29 , which we will call the walk - subgroup of ( h , v ) .",
    "walk - subsets depend on the assignment @xmath35 and the graph @xmath28 .",
    "for example ,",
    "if @xmath36 assigns the identity element to every edge , then for every group @xmath29 and graph @xmath28 the walk - subgroup is trivial . to see the dependence on the structure of @xmath28 , suppose that @xmath28 is the path graph with group element @xmath37 on edge @xmath38 : the walk - subset consists of the @xmath39 elements @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "we have the following theorem about the structure of the walk - subsets for certain special assignments .    given a graph h and a spanning tree t , define @xmath36 to be the assignment which sends every edge in @xmath42 to the identity element , and any edge not in @xmath42 to an element @xmath43 . in this case",
    "the walk - subgroup is the subgroup of @xmath29 generated by the @xmath37 .",
    "this results from the following observation : we may choose a cycle basis for @xmath28 such that every edge of @xmath28 not in @xmath42 is in its own fundamental cycle . to generate",
    "any given element of @xmath44 simply consider the walk that starts in the fundamental cycle of the first required generator , does the requisite number of loops ( raising this generator to the required power ) , and then traverses edges in @xmath42 ( which are all assigned the identity element ) to the next required generator and so on .",
    "finally , noting that fundamental cycles can be traversed in either direction regardless of the point of entry completes the proof .",
    "a lift of a graph is a covering space of a graph in the topological sense .",
    "in fact , it is shown in @xcite that any lift of given graph can be obtained through the construction using an assignment of permutations ( or perfect matchings ) to edges as shown in section 1 .",
    "one may even assume that any given set of edges which does not contain a cycle is assigned the identity permutation and still obtain every lift of a graph . in random",
    "lifts these permutations are chosen independently at random .",
    "a graphical property only depends on the isomorphism type of a graph .",
    "in particular , a set @xmath45 of all graphs with graphical property @xmath46 is a union of complete isomorphism classes of graphs .",
    "it is also well known that given any set of edges of @xmath5 which does not contain a cycle , the assumption that this set is assigned the identity permutation does not change the probability of any graphical property of a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath5 .",
    "these edges are called _ flat _ edges . in a way , the usual construction of random lifts has a lot of redundancy , and we can still precisely describe the graphical properties of random @xmath2-lifts after conditioning on assuming a subset of a subtree to be flat . for our purposes",
    "we will always work with the following assumption : given a graph @xmath5 , we choose a spanning tree @xmath42 of @xmath5 and assume that every edge in it is assigned the identity permutation , i.e. is flat .",
    "since we may assume that random @xmath2-lifts of graphs of @xmath5 are constructed by assigning permutations from @xmath6 uniformly at random to edges outside a spanning tree @xmath42 , we can use corollary 3.3 to define the walk - subgroup of random @xmath2-lifts of @xmath5 as the subgroup of @xmath6 generated by @xmath3 random permutations where @xmath47 is the number of edges of @xmath5 which lie outside of the spanning tree which is also known as the betti number of the graph .",
    "the following definitions will be useful ,    every vertex in a lift @xmath4 of a graph @xmath5 is labeled by a vertex of @xmath5 and an element of @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "all vertices labeled by the same element of @xmath48 $ ] are collectively referred to as a section of @xmath4 .",
    "every element @xmath49 in the walk - subgroup of a lift is the product of permutations assigned to edges along a ( not unique ) walk in the base graph .",
    "such a walk is called an associated walk of @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath50 is a sequence of lifts of degree @xmath51 respectively , then @xmath52 is an @xmath53-lift of @xmath5 .",
    "however a random lift of degree @xmath54 of a random lift of degree @xmath55 of @xmath5 is not a random lift of @xmath5 .",
    "that is to say it is distributed differently than a lift produced by a randomly assigning elements of @xmath56 to edges of @xmath5 .",
    "iterated lifts were studied in chapter 3.3 of @xcite using wreath products of symmetric groups .",
    "it is shown there that similar to the way in which @xmath2-lifts of graphs can be described by assigning elements of @xmath6 to edges of a graph , iterated @xmath53-lifts can be described by assigning elements of @xmath57 to the edges .",
    "so to construct a random @xmath53-lift , we may assign random elements of @xmath57 to the edges .",
    "probabilistically , the model produced this way is the same one as taking a random @xmath55 lift , and a random @xmath54 lift of the result and so on .",
    "this construction produces the same redundancy as in the case for random @xmath2-lifts , and the probability of any graphical property of a random @xmath53-lift does not change even if we assume that a set of edges which does not contain a cycle is assigned the identity element of @xmath57 .",
    "there is a simple way in which the wreath product naturally arises in iterated lifts . in lifts of a graph @xmath5",
    ", the fiber of an edge @xmath12 connecting @xmath13 to @xmath14 in @xmath5 may connect the fibers of @xmath13 and @xmath14 through any perfect matching , but in iterated lifts it must also respect the family tree structure of the fibers of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for example , if @xmath4 is an iterated @xmath58-lift of @xmath5 , then the fiber of any vertex or edge has @xmath58 elements , which may be indexed by @xmath59 where @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] represent the @xmath62th lift of the @xmath38th lift of the vertex or edge .",
    "if @xmath12 connects @xmath13 to @xmath14 in @xmath5 , say that @xmath38th edge above @xmath12 connects the @xmath63th vertex over @xmath13 to the @xmath64th vertex over @xmath14 in the @xmath55-lift , then the @xmath59th edge above @xmath12 can only be connected to some @xmath65th vertex above @xmath13 to some @xmath66th vertex above @xmath14 in the iterated @xmath58-lift .",
    "the wreath product @xmath67 is precisely the set of matchings which are restricted to respect the structure of a rooted tree in which the root has @xmath55 children , each of which have @xmath54 children . for a thorough discussion one may consult chapter 3.3 of @xcite .",
    "we formally define wreath products and iterated random lifts :    given two permutation groups @xmath29 and @xmath68 with domains t and s respectively , the wreath product of @xmath29 and @xmath68 , denoted @xmath69 , is the semi - direct product @xmath70 , where the action of @xmath71 on @xmath72 is defined to be @xmath73 .",
    "the natural and faithful action of @xmath74 on the set @xmath75 is defined to be : given @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the wreath product of more than two groups can be obtained iteratively .",
    "an iterated random @xmath81-lift , @xmath4 , of a graph @xmath5 is constructed in the following way .",
    "first , arbitrarily orient the edges of @xmath5 and assign an element of @xmath57 to every edge of @xmath5 uniformly at random .",
    "the vertices of @xmath4 are @xmath82 where @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath84 is connected to @xmath85 if and only if there is an edge @xmath12 connecting @xmath13 to @xmath14 in @xmath5 , and this edge was assigned an element @xmath86 such that @xmath87 .",
    "the edges of @xmath4 are unoriented .    with the usual assumption that the edges of a spanning tree are flat",
    ", we can define the walk - subgroup of an iterated random @xmath53-lift of @xmath5 as the subgroup of @xmath57 generated by @xmath3 random elements of @xmath57 where @xmath47 is the number of edges of @xmath5 which lie outside of the spanning tree .",
    "given two random elements @xmath88 of @xmath6 , it is natural to ask what subgroup of @xmath6 they generate .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath88 are both even permutations , they can only generate even permutations , and therefore can not generate any subgroup of @xmath6 bigger than @xmath89 .",
    "this happens with probability @xmath90 .",
    "so we can not hope to say that two random elements a.a.s .",
    "generate the whole of @xmath6 .",
    "however , in @xcite it is shown that the probability that two random elements of @xmath6 generate @xmath6 or @xmath89 is at least @xmath91 , which goes to one as @xmath2 increases . in @xcite",
    "this result is improved using facts about the classification of finite simple groups .",
    "the probability that two random elements of @xmath6 generate @xmath6 or @xmath89 is @xmath92 .",
    "there is a concise summary of babai s proof in @xcite : babai s proof begins by appealing to two results of @xcite .",
    "the first shows that the probability that two random elements of @xmath6 generate a transitive subgroup of @xmath6 is @xmath93 .",
    "the second shows that the probability that this group is imprimitive is @xmath94 .",
    "babai complements these results with the following observation which relies on the classification of finite simple groups : the probability that these elements generate a primitive subgroup different from @xmath6 or @xmath89 is @xmath95 .",
    "it follows that the probability that two random elements of @xmath6 generate a transitive subgroup of @xmath6 which is not @xmath6 or @xmath89 is less than @xmath96 , which is @xmath97 .",
    "it is easily possible to prove a general version of babai s result for @xmath98 random generators using the same proof strategy and minor modifications of arguments used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the following three lemmas require no new mathematical insight .",
    "the probability that @xmath3 independently chosen random permutations from @xmath6 fail to generate a transitive subgroup is bounded by @xmath99    replace 2 with @xmath3 in lemma 1.1 of @xcite .",
    "the probability that @xmath3 random elements generate a transitive but imprimitive subgroup of @xmath6 is less than @xmath100 .",
    "replace 2 with @xmath3 in the arguments after lemma 1 and in lemma 2 of @xcite .    the probability that @xmath3 random permutations generate a primitive group other than @xmath89 or @xmath6 is @xmath101 .",
    "the probability that @xmath3 random elements of @xmath6 generate @xmath6 or @xmath89 is @xmath102 .    from lemmas 3.10 and 3.11 , we have that the probability that @xmath3 random permutations generate a transitive subgroup of @xmath6 , but not @xmath6 or @xmath89 is less than @xmath103 which is certainly @xmath104 .",
    "the result follows from lemma 3.9 .    in order to set up our application of this theorem ,",
    "we mention the following fact from group theory : @xmath6 and @xmath89 act @xmath2-transitively and @xmath105-transitively on @xmath106 respectively . keeping this mind , theorem 3.12",
    "can be reinterpreted as follows : the probability that @xmath3 random permutations generate a subgroup of @xmath6 which acts at least @xmath105-transitively on @xmath106 is @xmath107 .",
    "as an example of the utility of the walk - subgroup of random @xmath2-lifts , we will use it to calculate the probability of connectivity in random @xmath2-lifts . as we mentioned before , when considering the random @xmath2-lifts of @xmath5 , we may choose a spanning tree @xmath42 of @xmath5 and assume that all edges in @xmath42 are flat i.e. are assigned the identity permutation . in particular , this assures that every section of the lift has a spanning tree inherited from @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a simple connected graph with @xmath108 more edges than vertices ( l @xmath109 1 ) .",
    "then a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath5 is connected with probability @xmath110 .",
    "we make the following connection to the walk - subgroup .    a random @xmath2-lift @xmath28 of @xmath5 is connected if and only if its walk - subgroup is a transitive subgroup of @xmath6 .",
    "suppose that @xmath28 is connected .",
    "starting at any vertex there exists a walk which can reach every other vertex .",
    "in particular , if the walk starts on the vertex @xmath7 , it must be able to reach the vertices @xmath11 for all @xmath111 .",
    "the projection of the walk taking @xmath7 to @xmath11 to @xmath5 gives an element of the walk - subgroup , @xmath49 , such that @xmath112 .",
    "since this is true for all @xmath38 and @xmath62 the walk - subgroup must be a transitive subgroup of @xmath6 .",
    "conversely suppose that the walk ",
    "subgroup is transitive . without loss of generality ,",
    "suppose a walk starts on vertex @xmath113 .",
    "it can first walk along the lifts of the flat edges of @xmath5 ( which form a spanning tree of every section of @xmath28 ) to cover all vertices of the form @xmath114 .",
    "then , it can take the walk associated with a permutation @xmath49 such that @xmath115 to end up at a vertex @xmath116 .",
    "such an element of the walk - subgroup exists by assumption .",
    "from here it can cover all vertices of the form @xmath117 and continue similarly , covering the whole graph .",
    "this tells us that from every vertex there is a walk which can cover the entire graph , implying that the graph is connected .",
    "let @xmath5 be a graph with @xmath3 non - flat edges ( or @xmath108 more edges than vertices ) .",
    "then the probability that a random lift of @xmath5 is connected is the probability that @xmath3 random elements of @xmath6 generate a transitive subgroup of @xmath118 .",
    "this lemma is an immediate consequence of propositions 4.2 and 3.2 .",
    "this follows from lemmas 4.3 and 3.9 .      the isoperimetric constant or edge expansion of a graph @xmath5 is defined to be @xmath119 where @xmath120 is number of edges leaving @xmath121 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a simple connected graph with @xmath108 more edges than vertices ( l @xmath109 1 ) .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath122 , such that a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath5 ( for @xmath123 ) has edge expansion at least @xmath124 , with probability @xmath110 .",
    "we make the following connection to the walk  subgroup .",
    "if @xmath28 is a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath5 and its walk  subgroup is a @xmath25transitive subgroup of @xmath6 for @xmath125 , then there exists a positive constant @xmath124 such that @xmath28 has expansion at least @xmath124 .",
    "let @xmath42 be a subset of vertices of @xmath28 such that @xmath126 .",

    ". we will consider the first case , as the calculation for the second case is similar .",
    "then there are @xmath146 indices in @xmath138 such that @xmath150 .",
    "for all such indices @xmath25 , the lift of the walk associated with @xmath49 starting at @xmath25 contains a unique edge in @xmath151 .",
    "in particular we have @xmath152    theorem 3.12 combined with the fact the action of @xmath6 is @xmath2-transitive and the action of @xmath89 is @xmath105-transitive implies the lower bound on the probability in theorem 4.5 .",
    "the upper bound on the probability holds because strictly positive edge expansion implies connectedness , and the probability of connectedness in theorem 4.1 matches the lower bound .",
    "we have shown that not only are random lifts connected with high probability , but that large sets have large boundaries .",
    "we can use this to prove the following theorem about @xmath1-edge connectivity , which we will simply call @xmath1-connectivity .",
    "let @xmath5 be a simple connected graph with minimum degree @xmath23 .",
    "there exists @xmath153 which is strictly increasing in @xmath1 such that the probability that a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath5 is @xmath1-connected is at least @xmath154 , given that @xmath155 .",
    "first we show that if we desire a non - trivial bound which works for all simple connected graphs with a fixed minimum degree , we must impose a condition on @xmath2 in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "consider the following example :    the barbell graph @xmath156 consists of two cliques of k+1 vertices connected by a single edge called the bridge .",
    "this graph has minimum degree k. however , no @xmath2-lift of @xmath156 , for @xmath157 is @xmath25-connected .",
    "this is because the bridge has only n copies , and cutting these n copies disconnects the graph .",
    "this tells us we need @xmath2 to be large enough in terms of @xmath1 for @xmath1-connectivity to be possible , and the condition in our theorem , @xmath158 , while not tight , is not a mere artifact of the proof strategy .",
    "let @xmath28 be a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath5 where @xmath23 is the minimum degree of @xmath5 and @xmath155 .",
    "if the walk  subgroup of @xmath28 is a @xmath1-transitive subgroup of @xmath6 , then there exists @xmath153 which is strictly increasing in @xmath1 such that the probability that @xmath28 is @xmath1-connected is at least @xmath154 .",

    "we can assume that @xmath164 , because @xmath165 implies there can not exist a single fiber such that @xmath166 since we are considering only sets with somewhat ` balanced ' fibers . since we assumed the walk subgroup to be @xmath1-transitive",

    "in fact , we show it must be a subgraph which contains a large number of cycles , and therefore a large number of edges in @xmath28 which are lifts of ( not necessarily distinct ) non - flat edges in @xmath5 . since many edges in such graphs need a random permutation to take them to the correct spot ( in order to complete the necessary number of cycles ) , they occur with low probability .",

    ". since fibers are totally disconnected and the minimum degree of any vertex is @xmath1 , the size of the boundary must be at least @xmath1 .",
    "* suppose @xmath171 .",
    "then we know that each vertex in this set must have at least @xmath172 edges leaving the set .",
    "this is because each vertex can at best connect to @xmath173 other fibers ( all of the fibers excluding itself ) .",
    "so the size of the boundary is at least @xmath174 .",
    "this is minimized as a function of @xmath169 in the given range when @xmath175 , giving us that the size of the boundary is at least @xmath176 .",
    "* let @xmath177 . in this case , each vertex has at least one edge leaving @xmath178 , and there are at least @xmath1 vertices .",
    "so the boundary must be @xmath179 .",
    "* now let @xmath180 .",
    "we may assume that such a set @xmath178 ( of size @xmath25 ) , is a connected subgraph of @xmath28 , since disconnected subgraphs have a boundary greater than or equal to the boundary of any of the components .",
    "we first show that any @xmath178 with boundary @xmath181 must have at least @xmath182 edges more than vertices .",
    "the vertices of @xmath178 have minimum degree @xmath1 , implying that the total degree of @xmath178 is at least @xmath183 .",
    "since @xmath178 is connected it has a spanning tree with @xmath184 edges , which contributes @xmath185 to the total degree of @xmath178 . of the remaining @xmath186 total degree ,",
    "at least @xmath187 must be accounted for by edges that connect back into the graph .",
    "this is because at most @xmath188 go outside @xmath178 by assumption . by eliminating the double counting of edges that stay within @xmath178 ,",
    "the total number of non - spanning tree edges in @xmath178 is at least @xmath189 where we use that @xmath190 .",
    "note that this quantity strictly increases with @xmath1 .",
    "we continue the rest of the proof for @xmath191 which is the worst case covered by our theorem , and it is clear that larger @xmath1 will result in better versions of the bounds to follow .",
    "we argue that since @xmath178 has at least @xmath182 edges in excess of a spanning tree , it must have at least @xmath182 edges which are lifts of ( not necessarily distinct ) non - flat edges in @xmath5 . for the sake of contradiction suppose that @xmath178 has less than @xmath182 non - flat edges .",
    "then upon deleting them , we are left with lifts of flat edges only , but more edges than in a spanning tree of @xmath178 .",
    "that means that we must have at least one cycle in @xmath178 , which must come from a cycle in @xmath5 . but",
    "a cycle in @xmath5 must contain at least one non - flat edge , and therefore @xmath178 must still contain at least one edge which is a lift of a non - flat edge . + now suppose that @xmath192 of these edges lie above a single edge in @xmath5 ( note that @xmath193 ) .",
    "the probability that a random permutation takes them to the correct points in their destination fiber to keep them within the subgraph is less than @xmath194 where the inequality follows since @xmath195 .",
    "now notice that lifts of different non - flat edges of @xmath5 are independent , which combined with the previous observation gives us that the probability that the necessary @xmath182 edges stay within the subgraph is less than @xmath196 .",
    "+ this shows us that the probability that a connected subgraph of @xmath25 vertices has a small boundary is very small .",
    "the total number of such subgraphs is certainly less than the number of sets of vertices of size @xmath25 , @xmath197 .",
    "so by the union bound , the probability that any such subgraph of size @xmath25 exists is certainly on the order of @xmath198 where the second inequality uses the fact that @xmath155 .    finally through union bound , the probability that any bad subgraph of any size exists is less than @xmath199 where we again use the fact that @xmath155 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "since for @xmath23 the number of non - flat edges is much greater than @xmath1 , then theorem 3.12 and proposition 4.9 imply theorem 4.7 through the union bound .",
    "the following theorem shows @xmath1-connectivity in @xmath2-lifts of families of graphs where @xmath1 grows slowly enough as a function of the degree of the lift and the number of vertices .",
    "there exists @xmath200 such that for all @xmath201 , a random @xmath2-lift of any connected simple graph with on @xmath25 vertices with minimum degree @xmath202 is a.a.s .",
    "@xmath1-connected .",
    "the proof is the same as theorem 4.7 using proposition 4.9 : use @xmath203 and follow the proof from ( [ equation : replace ] ) to show a @xmath204 probability that @xmath1-connectivity fails .",
    "all our results can be generalized to iterated random lifts by simply viewing iterated random lifts as a sequence of lifts .",
    "we show an analogue of theorem 4.1 only , but the results about edge expansion and @xmath1-connectivity hold as well .",
    "let @xmath5 be a simple connected graph with @xmath108 more edges than vertices ( l @xmath109 1 ) , then an iterated random @xmath205-lift is connected with probability @xmath206    following our discussion of iterated random lifts : an iterated random @xmath205-lift is a random @xmath207-lift of an iterated random @xmath208-lift and so on , beginning with a random @xmath55-lift of @xmath5 . by independence , the probability that an iterated random @xmath205-lift is connected is just the product of the probabilities that each graph in its iterated construction is connected .",
    "we can calculate this probability for each graph in the iterated construction using theorem 4.1 .",
    "since @xmath5 has @xmath108 more edges than vertices , we can easily calculate that an iterated @xmath209-lift of @xmath5 has @xmath210 more edges than vertices , and the result follows .",
    "the results of theorems 4.1 and 4.5 apply to random lifts of graphs which are not simple , that assumption was needed only in the proofs pertaining to @xmath1-connectivity but adopted throughout for continuity .",
    "lifts of graphs are topological covering spaces and it is well known that covering spaces of homotopy equivalent spaces have some similarities .",
    "we show that there exist graphical properties of random lifts whose probability only depends on the homotopy type of their base graph , that is , properties whose probabilities are homotopy invariant .",
    "it is not straightforward in general to determine whether two spaces are homotopy equivalent , however , the situation is easy for graphs .",
    "it is easy to show that two connected graphs are homotopy equivalent if and only if the number of edges minus the number of vertices is the same . using this",
    "we show that the probability that a random lift of @xmath5 is connected or has edge expansion bounded below by @xmath124 ( from theorem 4.5 ) only depends on the homotopy type of @xmath5 .",
    "while random models of covering spaces have only been studied for graphs so far , we expect such invariants to exist for any model of random covering spaces of topological spaces .",
    "though we only state the following results for random lifts , similar properties of iterated random lifts can be shown by the same method .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath28 be connected graphs .",
    "then the probabilities that a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath211 and a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath28 are connected are equal if and only if @xmath5 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath28 .    the probability that these lifts are connected are simply the probabilities that their walk - subgroups are subgroups of @xmath6 which act transitively on @xmath212",
    ". these probabilities only depend on the number of generators for their respective walk - subgroups , which is the same for random @xmath2-lifts of homotopy equivalent graphs .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath28 be connected graphs .",
    "then the probabilities that a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath211 and a random @xmath2-lift of @xmath28 have edge expansion bounded below by @xmath124 and @xmath213 respectively are equal if and only if @xmath5 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath28 .",
    "similar to the previous proof : this fact is implied by transitivity properties of the walk - subgroup which depend only on the number of generators , which is the same for random @xmath2-lifts of homotopy equivalent graphs .",
    "we will provide another perspective on homotopy invariants of random lifts .",
    "any graph @xmath5 with @xmath214 is homotopy equivalent to the bouquet of @xmath215-circles , @xmath216 which consists of a single vertex with @xmath215 loops .",
    "lifts of @xmath216 are well studied , and also known as unions of permutations or random @xmath217-regular multigraphs .",
    "a random lift of @xmath216 or a random @xmath217-regular multigraph on @xmath2 vertices is obtained by choosing @xmath215 permutations @xmath218 independently and randomly from @xmath6 , and adding the edges @xmath219 for all @xmath38 to the @xmath2 ( initially isolated ) vertices .",
