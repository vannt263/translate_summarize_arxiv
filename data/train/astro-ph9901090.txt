    "the short - period comet 46p / wirtanen will be investigated for two years from 2011 during the rosetta cometary rendez - vous mission .",
    "therefore , precise predictions of the future perihelion passages and space positions of the comet are crucial for successful planning of the mission .",
    "comet 46p / wirtanen has been observed at eight returns during the almost fifty - year interval since its discovery in 1948 by c.a .",
    "two close approaches of the comet to jupiter in 1972 and 1984 are responsible for significant changes of orbital elements .",
    "apart from the planetary perturbations the comet is subject to nongravitational forces ( @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "the method of determining the nongravitational effects in the orbital motion of the comet was proposed by @xcite ( 1973 ) . in marsden",
    "s formalism the three orbital components of a nongravitational force acting on the comet have the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 represent the radial , transverse and normal component of the nongravitational force , respectively .",
    "the analytical function @xmath10 simulates the ice sublimation rate as a function of the heliocentric distance @xmath11 .    in a previous paper ( @xcite 1996 , hereafter paper i ) we concluded that the forced precession model of the rotating nonspherical cometary nucleus adequately explains the variations of the nongravitational effects observed in the periodic comet wirtanen and is suitable for making predictions of the future returns . in the present paper",
    ", we continue the study of nongravitational motion of the 46p / wirtanen including the astrometric observations from the last apparition .",
    "a forced precession of the spin axis is caused by the torque which arises when the vector of the jet force ( exerted by the outgassing on the nucleus ) does not pass through the mass center of the nonspherical nucleus .",
    "the precession rate is a function of the nucleus orientation , the lag angle @xmath1 of the maximum outgassing behind the subsolar meridian , the modulus of the reactive force , the nucleus oblateness @xmath5 and the precession factor @xmath4 which depends on rotation period and nucleus size ( @xcite 1984 , 1988 ) .",
    "the orientation of the nucleus is defined by two angles : the obliquity @xmath2 of the orbital plane to the cometary equator and the longitude @xmath3 of the sun at perihelion .",
    "the nongravitational force components ( which vary along the orbit ) are related to the angular parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 of the rotating nucleus by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the true anomaly of the comet and @xmath15 denote the direction cosines which are time - dependent due the orbital and precessional motion of the comet .",
    "we adopt marsden s water production curve , @xmath10 , because of its analytical form which is useful for orbital computations .",
    "expressions for time variations of the angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the precession rate , and the direction cosines of the nongravitational force are given by @xcite ( 1998 ) .",
    "the values of five precessional parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath4 were derived in paper i ; the sixth  oblateness of the comet nucleus  could not be determined because of poor observational material which then consisted of 67 positional observations covering the period 19481991 . since that analysis , the new ,",
    "high - quality data have become available from the latest apparition 19951997 .",
    "this allows us to refine the previous forced precession model .",
    "the aim of this paper is to obtain the best model of the comet by linking all the astrometric observations made during the eight recorded appearances of the comet .",
    "the distribution of the 67 observations of comet 46p / wirtanen carried out before 1995 is given in table 1 of the paper i. at present , 247 positional observations ( 494 residuals ) are available from the recent apparition covering the time interval of 26  june  1995  30  december  1997 . since the observations are distributed highly nonuniformly over the apparitions , we replaced more than two observations of the same day by one average comet position ( so - called normal place ) , which yields 300 residuals for the last return of the comet . combining mean residuals 196 , 167 , 152 , 229 , 244 ,",
    "197 and 101 calculated separately for apparitions in 1948 , 1954 , 1961 , 19671975 ( two apparitions ) , 1986 , 1991 and 1996 , respectively , we obtained an _ a priori _ mean residual ( @xcite 1991 ) of 138 .",
    "the equations of the comet motion have been integrated numerically by the recurrent power series method ( @xcite 1979 , 1984 ) , taking into account all the planetary perturbations .",
    "a detailed description of the forced precession model is given in paper i. the first set of equations contained six unknown parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 which were determined simultaneously with six orbital elements from the observational equations by an iterative least squares process .",
    "this solution is given in the first column of table  1 ( hereafter model  i ) .",
    "the positive value of @xmath5 implies that  according to our model ",
    "46p / wirtanen rotates on its shorter axis .",
    "however , a comparison of the mean residual of this solution with the _ a priori _ mean residual shows that a better solution is required for the motion of the comet .",
    "therefore , we no longer make the assumption that the activity reached a maximum exactly at perihelion . we have found ( from our orbital calculations )",
    "that between the apparitions of 1986 and of 1991 ( one revolution after the second closest approach of the comet to jupiter ) something changed in the cometary activity and/or in the geometry of the sublimation area on the nucleus surface .",
    "these changes can be modelled by setting the discontinuity of parameters @xmath0 and/or @xmath19 close to the moment of aphelion passage between 1986 and 1991 : @xmath20 where parameter @xmath19 represents a time shift of the maximum value of @xmath10 with respect to the perihelion time .",
    "thus , the function @xmath10 is then replaced by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( @xcite 1988 , @xcite 1994 ) .",
    "however , it turned out that due to the relatively poor observational material ( especially that collected before 1995 ) , only two additional parameters could be numerically determined .",
    "thus , we were limited to introduce the discontinuity of @xmath19 and @xmath0 in two separate models , denoted as model  2a and model  2b respectively in table  1 .    from this reason ,",
    "the final two solutions are described by eight parameters : + @xmath0 ,  @xmath1 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath23 @xmath24  ( model 2a ) , + and + @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath1 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath27  ( model 2b ) , + which were determined from the observational equations along with the orbital elements .",
    "these solutions , characterized by mean residuals of 168 and 159 , are given in table  1 .",
    "both models give a prediction of perihelion passage in february 2008 ( the last before the rosetta rendez - vous withthe comet ) with a time dispersion of 0.038  day .",
    "the motion of the nucleus rotation axis represented by angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the qualitative variations of the nongravitational force components @xmath28 , acting on the comet during its successive returns to the sun are presented in fig .  1 for model  2b ( solid curves ) . dashed curves in the same figure represent the variation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for model  2a ; the variations of @xmath29 are undistinguishable from those for model  2b .",
    "this means that the same character of the nongravitational accelerations can be interpreted by two different models of cometary activity .",
    "the time variations of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath28 are a consequence of the forced precession and orbital changes caused by two close approaches to jupiter in 1972 and 1984 .",
    "these close encounters with jupiter reduced the perihelion distance from 1.63  au in 1947 to 1.08  au in 1986 , which caused an increase of the nongravitational force during this period ( fig .",
    "both solutions imply a retrograde rotation of the cometary nucleus ( @xmath3090 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the jorda & rickman ( 1995 ) conclusion from the positive lightcurve asymmetry combined with the negative rate of comet orbital period change .",
    "the present precession models impose some constraints on the physical properties of the nucleus of comet 46p / wirtanen . using these solutions it is possible to calculate values of sekanina s ( 1984 ) torque factor @xmath31 . using this parameter we are able to calculate the value of the @xmath32 ratio from the formula : @xmath33 , where the equatorial radius , @xmath34 , is related to the oblateness and the polar radius , @xmath35 : @xmath36 .",
    "our models give :        from several estimates of the nucleus radius of comet wirtanen it appears that this comet possesses one of the smallest nuclei detected so far . from photographic magnitudes @xcite ( 1995 ) obtained a radius of the nucleus  of less than 2 km , probably 1.51.8  km  .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite ( 1997 ) , who derived a lower limit of the nucleus radius of 1.0  km from visual magnitudes of the comet .",
    "however , systematically smaller sizes of the nucleus are reported from ccd photometry .",
    "ccd observations done by @xcite ( 1997 ) give an upper limit of 0.8  km and @xcite ( 1998 ) obtained a mean effective radius of @xmath39  km .",
    "such small radii imply that a large fraction of the surface of the nucleus is active .",
    "the active area of 1.80 km@xmath40 obtained by @xcite ( 1998 ) covers about 7% of the sunlit surface area for a radius of 2  km , 45% for a radius of 0.8  km , and rises to more than 80% for a radius of 0.60  km .    assuming that the nuclear radius of 46p / wirtanen most likely is in the range 0.52.0  km we obtain from eq .",
    "( 2 ) : @xmath41~}:\\mbox{~~~~~~~~ } 0.5 \\mbox{~~~~~~~ } & 1.0 \\mbox{~~~~~~~ } & 2.0 & \\mbox{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ } \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath42 } =   \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{llll }   .42 \\pm .01   & .83 \\pm .01 & 1.66\\pm .02 & \\mbox{for mod 1 }   \\\\   3.0 \\pm 0.9   & 6.0 \\pm 1.8 & 12.0 \\pm 3.7 & \\mbox{for mod 2a } \\\\   2.5 \\pm 0.7   & 5.0 \\pm 1.4 & 10.0 \\pm 2.8 & \\mbox{for mod 2b } \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 is the effective radius of the nucleus .",
    "thus , model  1 gives very small rotational periods ( fast rotation ) .",
    "assuming that the mean density of the cometary material is equal to 1  g/@xmath44 and the comet radius is equal to 1  km , one finds that the gravitational force at the nucleus surface is almost 20 times smaller than the centrifugal force that should cause rotational splitting of the nucleus .",
    "alternatively , model  1 requires the comet radius to be greater than 4  km .",
    "based on observations made at intermediate heliocentric distances and assuming a double - peaked light curve , @xcite ( 1997 ) found a possible rotational period of about 7.6 hours .",
    "@xcite ( 1998 ) derived a double peaked light curve with a rotational period of 6.0@xmath450.3 hr .",
    "models 2a and 2b are in agreement with these results . assuming 6  hr for the rotational period our models  2a and 2b",
    "give a radius in the range of 0.71.5  km and of 0.91.7  km , respectively .",
    "from the range of variation of the light curve @xcite ( 1998 ) found that the ratio of the axes must be greater than 1.20 for the assumed ellipsoidal body .",
    "our values of 1.14@xmath450.05 ( model  2a ) and 1.11@xmath450.05 ( model  2b ) for the @xmath46 ratio are only slightly below their lower limit .",
    "thus , we concluded that models  2a and 2b are to be preferred over model  1 because of the smaller mean residual , and the reasonable prediction of the @xmath32 ratio .",
    "however , not all observational facts are explained by our models .",
    "the negative values of time shifts @xmath19 ( model 2b ) and @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( model 2a ) suggest that the gas production rate peaks before the perihelion passage .",
    "this is in contradiction with the positive light curve asymmetry given in @xcite ( 1995 ) assuming that the jet force is produced only by sublimation directly from the nuclear surface .",
    "this question was also pointed out by @xcite ( 1998 ) . to explain this problem , they discussed a model of 46p / wirtanen in which the nucleus is subject to fragmentation along with sublimation .",
    "the icy chunks which break from the surface are expelled by the drag of the outflowing gas from the pores and propelled by a jet force due to sublimation .",
    "they argued that if the outgassing from icy circumnuclear material is predominant then it gives rise to the postperihelion brightness .",
    "thus , it is possible that the gas production curve related to the nongravitational effects has no correspondence to the postperihelion shift of lightcurve maximum observed for 46p / wirtanen .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that the discontinuity in global activity obtained from orbital calculations would not be detected in the visible brightness of the comet .",
    "more studies are needed to judge whether the fragmentation hypothesis is true .    for all of these reasons",
    ", we conclude that our forced precession model for the rotating comet nucleus ( model 2b or 2a ) reproduces  with very good precision  the nongravitational motion of 46p / wirtanen during an almost fifty - year interval and gives nucleus parameters ( e.g. size and rotational period ) consistent with the available photometric observations as well .",
    "future evolution of the orbital elements and orientation of the comet spin - axis is presented in table  2 for model  2b since this model represents the orbital motion with the smallest mean residual .",
    "one should note that the nongravitational forces have a significant influence on the cometary position even during a single apparition of the comet .",
    "thus , these effects  even within a single apparition  must be included into any accurate orbit calculations .",
