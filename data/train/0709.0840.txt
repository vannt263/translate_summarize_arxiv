    "the enhanced @xmath6 variation has been ascribed to the unusual fluxon structure in mgb@xmath0  sc , due to the two superconducting gaps  @xcite ; in this paper , we would discuss the irreversible properties of @xmath6 in mgb@xmath0 .    a comparison among the results in the different samples , reported in fig",

    "as it is well known , the magnetic - field - induced variations of the mw surface resistance are due to the presence and motion of fluxons within the mw - field penetration depth  @xcite ; in particular , at low temperatures and for applied magnetic fields lower enough than the upper critical field , they are essentially due to vortex motion induced by the mw current . in most of the models for fluxon dynamics reported in the literature ,",
    "the fluxon distribution is assumed uniform , neglecting the effects of the critical state of the fluxon lattice . on the other hand , a magnetic hysteresis in the @xmath7 curve",
    "is expected in sc in the critical state because of the different fluxon density at increasing and decreasing dc fields . in order to account for this hysteretic behavior ,",
    "it is essential to consider the fluxon distribution in the sample determined by the critical current density @xmath5 .",
    "recently , we have investigated the field dependence of the mw surface resistance of sc in the critical state  @xcite , by taking into due account the fluxon distribution , and we have quantitatively justified the hysteretic behavior of the @xmath7 curve detected in nb samples  @xcite .",
    "the field geometry we have used ( see fig .  [ sample ] ) is particularly convenient to investigate such effects essentially for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the effects of the non - uniform fluxon distribution on @xmath6 are enhanced because in the sample surfaces normal to the external magnetic field the mw current , penetrating along the fluxon axis within the mw - field penetration depth , bends the end segments of all the fluxons .",
    "moreover , just in this case , one can calculate the average value of @xmath6 by integration over the sample surfaces that contribute to the mw energy losses .",
    "we have shown that the parameter that mainly determines the features of the @xmath7 curve is the full penetration field , @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , the hysteresis width is related to the value of @xmath38 ; samples of small size and/or small @xmath5 are expected to exhibit weak hysteretic behavior .",
    "@xmath38 determines also the shape of the hysteresis loop . on increasing @xmath4 from 0 up to @xmath38 ,",
    "more and more sample regions contribute to the mw losses , giving rise to a positive curvature of the increasing - field branch of the @xmath7 curve . for @xmath39 , in the whole sample",
    "the local magnetic induction depends about linearly on the external magnetic field and the increasing - field branch is expected to have a negative concavity .",
    "the shape of the decreasing - field branch is strictly related to the shape of the magnetization curve ; it should exhibit a negative concavity , with a monotonic reduction of @xmath6 in the whole field range swept .    a comparison among the results reported in the different panels of fig .",
    "[ insieme ] shows that in the powder sample the hysteresis width is smaller than that observed in the bulk samples . in the framework of the critical - state model ,",
    "this finding is ascribable to the small value of @xmath38 due to the reduced size of the powder grains , with respect to the bulk samples .",
    "furthermore , the decreasing - field branch of the @xmath7 curve of sample p exhibits a monotonic decrease , starting from @xmath32 down to @xmath28 , as expected . on the contrary , in all of the bulk",
    "samples the shape of the hysteresis shows several anomalies .",
    "the most unexpected behavior concerns the plateau observed in the decreasing - field branch of the @xmath7 curve , after the sample had been exposed to relatively high fields .",
    "the presence of this plateau is puzzling because it would suggest that the trapped flux does not change anymore on decreasing @xmath4 below a certain threshold value , of the order of 0.1  t. a further anomaly is visible in the increasing - field branch , which exhibits negative concavity in the whole field range swept , despite the estimate value of @xmath38 for the bulk samples is few tesla  @xcite . on the contrary , in the @xmath7 curve of sample p",
    "one can note a change of concavity in the increasing - field branch at @xmath40  t , which is a reasonable value of @xmath38 for the powder sample .",
    "we would remark that the magnetic field value at which the decreasing - field branch of the @xmath7 curve deviates from the increasing - field one could differ from @xmath3 deduced from magnetization measurements . indeed , it has been shown that , in samples of finite dimensions , the application of ac magnetic fields normal to the dc field may induce the fluxon lattice to relax toward an uniform flux distribution  @xcite , reducing the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the process is particularly relevant for thin samples and/or small critical current .",
    "furthermore , considering the sensitivity of our experimental apparatus , we expect to detect hysteresis for @xmath5 greater than @xmath41 . in this framework , one can justify the reduced value of @xmath23 we obtained in sample p ( see fig .  [ insieme](d ) ) , which is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than the value estimated using @xmath5 values reported in the literature for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the same justification can not be given for the results obtained in the bulk samples . from fig .",
    "[ bulk ] one can see that , after the inversion of the field - sweep direction , the @xmath7 curve shows an initial reversible behavior , independently of the value of @xmath34 . as a result , the value of the magnetic field at which the decreasing - field branch deviates from the increasing - field one depends on @xmath34 .",
    "we would remark that this result has been obtained in all of the bulk samples we have investigated .",
    "this finding disagrees with the meaning of the irreversibility line .",
    "indeed , the region of the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane in which sc exhibit irreversible magnetic properties is not expected to depend on the magnetic history of the sample , but only on the @xmath5 value at the corresponding temperature and external magnetic field . on the other hand , this anomaly has not been observed in the powder sample ; indeed , fig .",
    "[ polvere ] shows that when the magnetic - field - sweep direction is reversed at fields smaller than the value of @xmath23 deduced from fig .",
    "[ insieme](d ) the @xmath7 curve is irreversible in the whole field range swept , consistently with the expected behavior .    in the framework of the critical state ,",
    "the main property distinguishing the magnetic response of samples having small or large dimensions is the residual magnetic induction .",
    "let us consider two samples with the same value of @xmath5 and different sizes , small and large ; furthermore , let us indicate as @xmath42 and @xmath43 the full penetration field of the small- and large - size sample , respectively . in the critical state  la bean ,",
    "after cycling @xmath4 in the range @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , the maximum value of the local magnetic induction in the samples will be @xmath46 in the small - size sample and @xmath47 in the large - size sample .",
    "this means that in sample regions far from the edges , the local magnetic field in the large - size sample can be much higher than that in the small - size one .",
    "since the dimensions of our bulk samples are a factor of @xmath48 greater than the grain dimensions of sample p , one may infer that the different behavior of the irreversible properties of @xmath6 in the powder and bulk samples is related to the higher value of the local magnetic induction inside the bulk samples , far from the edges , when the applied field is reduced after it had reached relatively high values .",
    "we have reported on the irreversible properties of the field - induced variations of the mw surface resistance of different ceramic mgb@xmath0  samples , powder and bulk , produced by different techniques .",
    "the results have qualitatively been discussed in the framework of models reported in the literature .",
    "the hysteretic magnetic behavior of @xmath6 observed in the bulk samples exhibits several anomalies not yet understood .",
    "in particular , the magnetic field at which the decreasing - field branch deviates from the increasing - field one depends on the maximum magnetic field reached ; furthermore , the decreasing - field branch of the @xmath7 curve shows an unexpected plateau extending from a certain value of @xmath4 , depending on @xmath34 , down to zero . in the powder sample ,",
    "consisting of mgb@xmath0  grains of small dimensions , the shape of the observed magnetic hysteresis is consistent with that expected using the critical - state model .",
    "this finding suggests that the anomalous response of the bulk samples is strictly related to the higher value of the local magnetic field in the interior of the sample , when the applied magnetic field is reduced after it had reached high values .",
