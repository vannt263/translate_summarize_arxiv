    "grb 030329 was detected on 2003 march 29 at 11:37:14.67 ut by the hete-2 spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the grb showed a duration of approximately 30 seconds in the 30400 kev energy range .",
    "thus , grb  030329 falls into the `` long - duration '' category of grbs @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic observations performed for grb  030329 @xcite strongly confirmed previous evidences @xcite that long grbs are related to ic supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "the redshift of grb  030329 was determined to be @xmath7 from early spectroscopy with the very large telescope ( vlt , @xcite ) .",
    "this makes grb  030329 the third nearest burst overall ( grb  980425 is the nearest at @xmath8 @xcite , and grb  031203 had @xmath9 @xcite ) .",
    "hst observations showed that the host is a dwarf compact ( full width half maximum , fwhm@xmath10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , to date there are no studies on the host galaxy sed , which gives relevant information on the extinction , dominant stellar population age , star formation rate ( sfr ) and galaxy type .",
    "in the present paper we report imaging and spectroscopic observations of the grb 030329 host galaxy .",
    "the photometric observations are based on a number of optical / nir facilities in order to compile a well sampled sed .",
    "the @xmath11-band observations where performed with the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) equipped with mosca .",
    "additional optical observations were obtained with the busca camera @xcite at the 2.2-m telescope of calar alto ( caha ) .",
    "busca allows simultaneous imaging in four broad optical bands .",
    "the four channels ( hereafter named @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) resemble johnson s @xmath16 bands , however they do not correspond to standard filters so they need to be calibrated by observing spectro - photometric standard stars @xcite .",
    "additionally @xmath17-band data were acquired with the 3.5-m caha telescope equipped with omega - prime .",
    "all these optical / nir imaging data were collected @xmath181 year after the grb event when the optical afterglow ( oa ) contribution to the total flux was negligible .",
    "the optical spectroscopic data were acquired using vlt equipped with fors2 .",
    "the observations were conducted with the 300v grism and an order sorting filter gg375 , covering the @xmath19     wavelength range .",
    "a @xmath20 wide slit yielded a spectral resolution of @xmath21   .",
    "the vlt observations were performed @xmath1882 days after the grb , when the oa was still contributing substantially to the measured flux ( @xmath22 according to @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the spectral measurements overestimated the host galaxy continuum emission , so the uncontaminated photometric points had to be used to estimate the continuum level .",
    "a more extended description can be found in @xcite",
    "based on the vlt spectroscopic data and using the r@xmath23 diagnostic method @xcite , we show that the grb030329 host is likely a low metallicity galaxy ( @xmath24 , see also @xcite ) . from fitting synthetic and empirical sed templates , we infer that the host galaxy of grb030329 is most probably a starburst galaxy .",
    "this result is in agreement with the conclusions reported by @xcite based on an independent host sample , who found that grb hosts correspond to starburst galaxies in @xmath25 of the cases .",
    "based on the hyperz public code @xcite , we derived a dominant stellar population age of @xmath26 years for a instantaneous starburst episode .",
    "however , an ideal starburst where all the star formation occurs simultaneously is not realistic .",
    "thus , in a real starburst , like the grb  030329 host , although the majority of the star formation occurred @xmath0 myr ago , the star formation can not stop sharply .",
    "thus , the inferred age of @xmath0 myr should be considered as an upper limit of the actual grb progenitor age .",
    "the sed fitting ( using either synthetic or empirical templates ) and the spectroscopic data yield a consistent extinction value of @xmath27 .",
    "two independent diagnostic techniques , namely the uv continuum and the [ oii ] emission line flux , provide consistently a sfr value of @xmath28 yr@xmath3 once it is corrected for the host galaxy reddening .",
    "the host restframe @xmath29-band absolute magnitude is @xmath4 ( @xmath30 , assuming @xmath31 , @xcite ) , confirming its subluminous nature @xcite . the grb030329 host sfr is the lowest among the sample of @xcite .",
    "however , the associated unextincted specific sfr is the highest ( ssfr = @xmath32 yr@xmath33 ) . all the findings present in this paper are consistent with the host galaxy being an active star forming galaxy .",
    "a grb030329 field galaxy accidentally placed on the fors2 slit , showed a redshift very similar to the host galaxy ( @xmath34 ) , which may be indicative of a possible galaxy clustering .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy of the grb030329 field might clarify the potential existence of a galaxy association around @xmath350.17    this research is partially supported by the spanish ministry of science and education through programmes esp2002 - 04124-c03 - 01 and aya2004 - 01515 ( including feder funds ) .",
