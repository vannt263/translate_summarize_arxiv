    "the corresponding density question for @xmath8 is , however , still open ( it was apparently first raised by ramachandra during the 1979 durham conference , but seems to appear in print only in heath - brown s note in  @xcite ) : the difficulty is that the values @xmath9 , @xmath10 , do not have a limiting distribution , as evidenced already by the hardy - littlewood asymptotic @xmath11 or by selberg s result that @xmath12 , @xmath10 , is asymptotically normal with variance _ growing to infinity _",

    "the second part of the integral is bounded by @xmath169 and in the first part , we use the approximation @xmath170 for @xmath166 , coming from the @xmath88 assumption on @xmath47 , to get @xmath171 the implied constant depending on @xmath47 , where the last integral was estimated using latexmath:[\\[\\|t\\|^2{\\leqslant}\\frac{1}{\\delta_n}q_n(t){\\leqslant}\\frac{\\kappa_n^2}{\\delta_n},\\quad\\quad     we can rewind the computation for the first term , with the gaussian @xmath54 instead of @xmath53 : for @xmath23 , we have @xmath173 where the implied constant is absolute , and then we write @xmath174 for @xmath23 , where the implied constant depends only on @xmath104 ( the last step is obtained using the density of the gaussian @xmath54 ) .    summarizing , we have found @xmath175 ( where we recall that @xmath176 ) .",

    "[ rm - tv ] from the probabilistic point of view , this proposition gives one answer , quantitatively , to the following type of question : given a sequence @xmath42 of ( real - valued ) random variables and parameters @xmath206 such that @xmath207 converges in law to a standard centered gaussian variable ( with variance @xmath208 ) , to what extent is @xmath53 itself distributed like a gaussian with variance @xmath209 ?",
    "here , we perform the comparison by looking at @xmath76 , @xmath71 a fixed open set . and",
    "this shows clear limits to the gaussian model : for example , any integer - valued random variable @xmath53 will have @xmath210 for any open set not intersecting @xmath211 , and yet may satisfy a central limit theorem ( e.g. , the @xmath61-th step of a symmetric random walk on @xmath211 ) .",
    "even more precisely , denoting @xmath212 the kolmogorov distance , there exist integer - valued random variables @xmath53 with @xmath213 where @xmath54 is a centered gaussian with variance @xmath61 , which indicates a close proximity  and yet , again , @xmath210 if @xmath214 .",
    "for instance , take @xmath53 with distribution function @xmath215 given by @xmath216    in particular , it is also impossible to prove results like theorem  [ th-2 ] using only this type of assumption on the kolmogorov distance . of course ,",

    "however , in our main applications , this condition fails .",
    "also , one could use test functions @xmath33 which decay at infinity faster than polynomials to weaken the uniformity requirement in the convergence condition  ( [ eq - strong - convergence ] ) ( for instance , for @xmath55 , it is possible to find @xmath33 which is smooth , non - negative and compactly supported in any fixed open interval and satisfies @xmath225 for any @xmath15 , as constructed , e.g. , in  ( * ? ? ?",

    "our arithmetic corollary is based on families of quadratic twists of elliptic curves over function fields , and we select a specific example for concreteness ( see  @xcite ) ; the basic theory , which we illustrate here , is again due to katz  @xcite .    for any odd prime power @xmath549 , any integer @xmath23 , we consider the elliptic curves over the functional field @xmath550 given by the weierstrass equations @xmath551 where @xmath552 is a parameter such that @xmath256 is not a critical value of @xmath553 .",
    "katz proved that the associated @xmath0-function ( which is now defined by the `` standard '' euler product over primes in @xmath554 $ ] , with suitable ramified factors ) is of the form @xmath555 where @xmath556 is a unique conjugacy class in @xmath539 .",
