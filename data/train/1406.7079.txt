    "a subset @xmath5 of @xmath4 is _ convex _ if its intersection with each affine line is connected .",

    "[ s : preliminaries ] below",
    ". this metric is invariant by the group of projective transformations of @xmath1 which preserve @xmath5 .",
    "several interesting phenomena were discovered and several good questions arose recently concerning that metric .",
    "it is non - riemannian except in the case where @xmath5 is an ellipsoid , but it shares several properties with the hyperbolic metric ( that is , a riemannian metric of constant negative curvature ) , especially if @xmath5 is strictly convex .",
    "there are also many differences . in the next sections",
    ", we will highlight some of these analogies and differences .",
    "we start by recalling very classical questions concerning convex sets equipped with their hilbert geometry . from the observation",
    "that the boundary of the unit disk is a smooth circle , it was natural to ask whether there exist convex domains in the projective plane with less regular boundary which admit compact quotients by discrete subgroups of the automorphism group of the domain .",
    "this question is natural because the unit disk admits such quotients .",
    "this existence question was already addressed by ehresmann in the 1930s @xcite , and it was answered affirmatively thirty years later by kac and vinberg @xcite . in modern language , a convex domain in the projective plane which admits a cocompact action is termed _",
    "divisible_. an ellipse in @xmath6 or an ellipsoid @xmath7 are well - known examples of convex domains .",
    "their compact quotients are the 2- and 3-dimensional compact hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "the theory of hyperbolic manifolds ( their construction , classification , their deformation and moduli spaces and their rigidity properties ) was born in the works of klein and poincar in the 1880s .",
    "this theory rapidly evolved into one of the most beautiful geometric theories that were developed during the twentieth century .",
    "important questions concerning more general convex projective manifolds ( quotients of divisible convex domains ) were addressed by benzcri in his thesis @xcite ( 1960 ) .",
    "this thesis contains some foundational work on the subject . to find conditions under which a convex domain is divisible is a difficult matter , as is the general question of existence of lattices in semisimple lie groups . in",
    "most of the cases , the boundary of such a domain is nowhere analytic .",
    "benzcri proved that if the boundary is @xmath8 , then the original convex set is an ellipsoid , which makes it identified with the hyperbolic space , more precisely , with the cayley - klein - beltrami model of that space .",
    "it also follows from the work of benzcri and from later works that the boundary @xmath9 of a divisible convex domain @xmath5 is either a conic ( in which case the projective structure arises from a hyperbolic structure ) or this boundary is nowhere @xmath10 for some @xmath11 .",
    "explicit examples of quotients of projective manifolds obtained by reflections along convex polyhedra in the sphere were obtained by vinberg in the early 1970s .",
    "these constructions may be considered as projective analogues of poincar s examples of hyperbolic manifolds that use reflections along convex polyhedra in hyperbolic space .",

    "the moduli space of convex projective structures generalizes the teichmller spaces of hyperbolic surfaces .",
    "there are many interesting recent developments on convex projective manifolds and their deformations .",
    "hitchin @xcite discovered a component in the space of representations of fundamental groups of surfaces in @xmath13 , for every @xmath14 , which contains teichmller space , and whose elements have several properties in common with teichmller space .",
    "he called these components teichmller components , and today such a component is called a hitchin component . in the case @xmath15 ,",
    "such components consist of real projective structures on surfaces .",
    "johnson and millson @xcite showed that there are non - trivial continuous deformations of higher - dimensional hyperbolic structures through strictly convex projective structures .",
    "conversely , one might expect that if a compact manifold admits a strictly convex projective structure , then it is a deformation of a hyperbolic structure .",
    "but benoist @xcite constructed in dimension four an example of a manifold which admits a strictly convex real projective structure but no hyperbolic structure .",
    "later , kapovich @xcite generalized the method to show that such examples exist in any dimension @xmath16 .    in this paper",
    ", we study some relations between hyperbolic geometry and differential projective geometry .",
    "some of the natural questions that appear in this setting are :    * to what extent does hilbert geometry generalize hyperbolic geometry ?",
    "* what are the relations and the common properties between spaces of deformations of convex projective structures and teichmller spaces ?",
    "* are there compactifications of deformation spaces of convex projective manifolds that are analogous to compactifications of teichmller spaces ? * how does the hyperbolic behavior of geodesic flows of hilbert manifolds generalize the hyperbolic behavior ( and in particular the anosov theory ) of negatively curved riemannian manifolds ?    the exposition is by no means complete and thorough . in some cases , we just record the results together with some references known to us , hoping to arouse the reader s interest in these questions .",

    "the sphere is equipped with the induced projective structure whose automorphism group ( also called the projective automorphism group ) is the group @xmath20 of real @xmath21 matrices of determinant @xmath22 .",
    "this is also the group of volume - preserving affine transformations of @xmath3",
    ".    the _ projective lines _ ( or , more simply , the _ lines _ ) in @xmath1 are the projections of the great circles of the sphere @xmath19 by the canonical map @xmath23 .",
    "this set of lines is preserved by the group of projective transformations .",
    "the projective lines play simultaneously the role of _ lines _ of a geometry defined in the axiomatic sense , and the role of geodesics for the hilbert metric , as we shall recall below .",

    "we say that @xmath5 is _ convex _ if the intersection of @xmath5 with any line of @xmath1 is connected .",

    "the space @xmath24 plays now the role of a euclidean space @xmath26 in which @xmath5 sits .",

    ".    this metric coincides with the familiar hyperbolic metric is the case where @xmath30 is an ellipse ( in dimension 2 ) or ellipsoid ( in dimension @xmath39 ) .",
    "this metric of the ellipse or ellipsoid is the so - called  projective model \" , or cayley - klein - beltrami model of hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the hilbert metric is finsler , and it is not riemannian unless @xmath30 is an ellipsoid .",

    "are the intersection points with @xmath30 of the oriented line in @xmath5 defined by the vector @xmath41 based at @xmath32 and where @xmath25 is our chosen norm on the affine patch .",
    "this norm is reversible , that is , it satisfies @xmath44 .",
    "the _ finsler metric _ associated to this finsler nom is the metric on @xmath5 defined by taking the distance between two arbitrary points to be the infimum of the lengths of @xmath45 paths joining them , where the length of a path is defined by integrating the norms of tangent vectors using formula ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "it is an easy exercise to show that this finsler metric on @xmath5 is the hilbert metric .",

    "a recent result by walsh described in chapter 5 of this volume ( @xcite ) says that the isometry group @xmath48 of the hilbert metric @xmath49 coincides with the group @xmath47 except in a few special cases where @xmath48 is an order - two extension of @xmath47 .",

    "[ d : structure ] a _ real projective structure _ on an @xmath2-dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath63 is a maximal atlas with values in the @xmath2-dimensional projective space @xmath1 whose transition functions are restrictions of projective automorphisms of @xmath1 .",
    "equipped with such a structure , the manifold @xmath63 becomes a _",
    "real projective manifold_. we shall sometimes delete the adjective  real \" since all the projective structures we consider in this paper are real . an _ isomorphism _ between two @xmath2-dimensional projective manifolds is a homeomorphism between the underlying manifolds which , in each projective chart , is locally the restriction of an element of the projective transformation group of @xmath1 .",
    "to each real projective structure is associated , by the general theory of @xmath64-structures of ehresmann @xcite a developing map and a holonomy homomorphism .",
    "the developing map arises from the attempt to define a global chart for the structure .",
    "it is constructed by starting with a coordinate chart around a given point and trying to extend it by analytic continuation .",
    "there is an obstruction for doing so if the manifold is not simply connected , and in fact , the only obstruction is the fundamental group of @xmath63 .",
    "( when we come back to the point we started with , by analytically continuing along a nontrivial path , we generally end up with a different germ of a chart into @xmath1 than the one we started with . )",
    "thus , instead of obtaining a map from our manifold @xmath63 to @xmath1 , we end up with a map @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the universal covering of @xmath63 .",
    "the holonomy homomorphism is an injective homomorphism @xmath67 satisfying @xmath68    this developing map is completely determined by its restriction to an arbitrary open subset of @xmath63 .",
    "when we change the initial coordinate chart in the above construction , the resulting map differs from the previous one by post - composition by an element of @xmath17 .",
    "the result is that although the developing map and the holonomy homomorphism depend on some choices ( namely , the choice of the initial chart ) , there are nice transformation formulae relating the various maps and homomorphisms obtained .",
    "in particular , the holonomy homomorphism is well defined up to a conjugation by an element of @xmath17 .    in the case where the developing map is a homeomorphism onto its image , we can write @xmath69 .",
    "we refer the reader to the paper by ehresmann @xcite for the general theory of developing maps and holonomy representations associated to geometric structures .",
    "benzcri @xcite , kuiper @xcite and subsequently koszul @xcite considered thoroughly the case of real projective structures .",
    "thurston , starting in the 1970s , included this theory as an important part of the general theory of geometrization of low - dimensional manifolds , see @xcite .",
    "goldman @xcite , motivated by ideas of thurston , developed the theory of moduli spaces of projective structures on surfaces . in their paper @xcite , sullivan and thurston",
    "give an example of a projective structure on the torus whose developing map is not a covering of projective space .",
    "talking about the sources of differential projective geometry , one has also mention the work of chern on the gauss - bonnet formula and characteristic classes that motivated several later works @xcite .    in what follows , we shall use the more restrictive notion of _ convex _ real projective structure .",
    "this is the case where the developing map sends homeomorphically the universal cover @xmath66 of @xmath63 onto a convex subset of some @xmath26 sitting in @xmath1 as the complement of an affine hyperplane .",
    "it turns out that such a structure is more manageable than a general real projective structure , and in particular , one can introduce the hilbert metric into the playground .",
    "there is a lot of classical and more recent activity on convex projective structures and their deformation spaces .    in what follows",

    "we call @xmath63 _ strictly convex _ if @xmath5 is strictly convex i.e. , if @xmath5 is convex and @xmath9 does not contain any line segment .",
    "the relation between definitions [ d : structure ] and [ d : cstructure ] is made through the natural identifications between @xmath5 and the universal cover of @xmath63 and between @xmath71 and the fundamental group of @xmath63 .    in dimension two , we have more knowledge about convex projective structures , and in particular there is the following in goldman @xcite ( proposition 3.1 ) :    let @xmath63 be a projective structure on a surface .",

    "this equivalence relation is used in the definition of the _ moduli space _ and the _ deformation space _ of convex real projective structures .",
    "we are mainly interested in the deformation space of convex projective structures on surfaces , which , like the teichmller space of hyperbolic ( or of conformal ) structures , is a space of equivalence classes of _ marked _ convex projective structures .",
    "we recall the concept of marking , which originates in teichmller theory .",

    "equivalently , we can define the deformation space of convex projective structures on a surface ( or , more generally , on a manifold ) as the space of homotopy classes of convex projective structures on that surface ( or manifold ) .",
    "this space is equipped with a natural topology arising from the @xmath45 topology on developing maps .",
    "this topology is hausdorff ( see @xcite p. 793 ) .",
    "we shall say more about the deformation space of real projective structures on surfaces in  [ para ] .",
    "the basic elements of the theory of convex real projective structures on closed surfaces and their deformations are due to kuiper @xcite , kac - vinberg @xcite and benzcri @xcite , and a complete theory has been developed ( including the case of surfaces with boundary ) by goldman @xcite .",
    "we shall elaborate on goldman s parametrization of the deformation space in  [ para ] .    for any convex real projective manifold @xmath87 ,",
    "the hilbert metric on @xmath5 descends to a metric on @xmath63 called the hilbert metric of @xmath63 .    for a strictly convex real projective structure @xmath87 , as in the hyperbolic case , there exists a unique hilbert geodesic in each homotopy class of a loop , unless this loop represents a parabolic element of the fundamental group , in which case the curve is homotopic to a puncture ( or cusp ) of @xmath82 .",

    "the proof uses a pair of pants decomposition of @xmath82 .",
    "we recall that a ( topological ) _ pair of pants _ in @xmath82 is an embedded surface which is homeomorphic to a sphere with three holes , where a _ hole _",

    "( one needs a convention to measure the twists , whereas the length parameters are intrinsic . ) in the case of a closed surface of genus @xmath91 , an euler characteristic argument shows that the number of curves in any pants decomposition of @xmath82 is @xmath156 .",
    "thus , the length and twist parameters of @xmath82 make a total of @xmath157 parameters , which is indeed the dimension of the teichmller space of @xmath82 .",
    "these parameters are the so - called fenchel - nielsen parameters .    for convex real projective structures on surfaces , there are analogues of the fenchel - nielsen parameters associated to a pair of pants decomposition , and we now describe them briefly .",

    "the pants curves are made geodesic with respect to the hilbert metric ( in the coordinate charts , the curves are made affine straight lines ) .",
    "the length of a simple closed geodesic in a given homotopy class is uniquely defined , and this set of lengths is part of the parameters associated to pair of pants decomposition . however , in the setting of projective structures , the other parameters of the fenchel - nielsen coordinates are more complicated to describe that in the case of teichmller space ; they are described in terms of @xmath160 matrices that represent the curves on the surface . in what follows , we shall give an idea of these parameters .",

    "the parametrization of convex real projective structures on @xmath90 is then done by first describing the structures on individual pairs of pants and then gluing , as we usually do in teichmller theory for the parametrization of hyperbolic structures .",
    "it turns out however that in the case of general real projective structures , the parameters associated to the pair of pants and to their gluing are more intricate than in the case of hyperbolic structures .    in this way",
    ", one is led to the question of understanding convex projective structures on pairs of pants , and this naturally requires the study of convex structures on surfaces with boundary .",
    "recall that a convex projective structure on a surface @xmath82 is a maximal atlas with values in @xmath6 whose transition functions are restrictions of projective automorphisms of @xmath1 .",
    "we need to consider convex projective structure on surfaces with boundary .",

    "positive hyperbolic_. the matrix in @xmath0 associated to such a boundary component",
    "is well defined up to conjugacy and it plays the role of the fenchel - nielsen length parameter in the hyperbolic setting .",
    "thus , we have a _ fenchel - nielsen type length parameter _ associated to a closed geodesic which is two - dimensional in the case of convex projective structures .",
    "one can glue projective structures on surfaces with boundary with standard convex projective collar neighborhoods by identifying the collar neighborhoods of boundary components using projective isomorphisms .",
    "goldman proves in @xcite that if we glue in this way a finite number of convex projective structures on surfaces with boundary which all have negative euler characteristic , then the resulting projective structure is convex .    on each pair of pants ,",

    "recall first that the projective transformations of @xmath6 can be represented by @xmath160 matrices .",
    "these matrices act on the vector space @xmath173 , and their action on @xmath6 is the quotient action .",

    "note also that the group acting by matrices on @xmath174 is in fact the group @xmath176 and not @xmath163 , but we shall not worry here about the difference between the two groups .",
    "thus , the holonomy of each closed geodesic on the surface @xmath82 is positive hyperbolic .",
    "in particular , the set of parameters for @xmath0-conjugacy classes of such a matrix is an open 2-cell .",

    "the three lines in @xmath6 passing through the pairs of such points divide the space into four triangles which are invariant by the action of the given diagonal matrix .",
    "goldman in @xcite describes in detail the action of this matrix on these triangles .    in the above matrix representation , the first parameter for the projective structure on the pair of pants which is associated to a closed curve which is the boundary of a pair of pants is @xmath182 , which is the hilbert metric length of the closed geodesic .",
    "the other parameter is @xmath183 .",

    "one of these parameters is called the twisting parameter , and the other one is called the vertical twist parameter .",
    "the two parameters combined are the analogues of the single fenchel - nielsen twist parameter of the case of hyperbolic surfaces .",

    "we already mentioned that strictly convex real projective structures have several properties which are similar to properties of negatively curved riemannian manifolds .",
    "let us give a few examples .",
    "benoist @xcite proved the following fundamental theorem about strictly convex projective manifolds , relating the regularity of the boundary of the universal covering @xmath5 to the large - scale geometry of a group that divides it .",
    "[ th : gromov ] let @xmath5 be a divisible convex set , divided by a group @xmath71",

    "@xmath228 is gromov - hyperbolic ; 2 .",
    "@xmath5 is strictly convex ; 3 .",
    "@xmath9 is @xmath45 ; 4 .",
    "the geodesic flow on @xmath70 is anosov .",
    "let us make a few comments on these statements .",
    "although the hilbert metric is generally non - riemannian , there is a natural notion of geodesic flow associated to the projective manifold @xmath70 , which is the quotient by @xmath71 of the geodesic flow on @xmath5 .",
    "the geodesic flow of @xmath5 is defined on the unit tangent bundle @xmath229 .",
    "this is the space of pairs @xmath230 where @xmath32 is a point in @xmath5 and @xmath100 is a vector of length one based at @xmath32 ( remember that for strictly convex manifolds , the projective lines are exactly the euclidean lines ) with respect to the hilbert metric .",
    "the geodesic flow @xmath231 is then obtained by moving the pair @xmath230 unit length in the direction specified by @xmath100 . the quotient flow , denoted by the same name , @xmath232 , is the geodesic flow associated to @xmath70 .",
    "we recall that a @xmath45 flow @xmath233 on a riemannian manifold @xmath234 is said to be anosov if there is a splitting of the tangent space at each point @xmath41 into three subspaces @xmath235 where @xmath236 have positive dimension , @xmath237 expanding under the flow , @xmath238 contracting and @xmath108 the generator of the flow . a typical anosov flow is the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of a manifold of negative curvature .",
    "anosov flows have interesting dynamical properties , for instance , the union of periodic orbits are dense . the definition of an anosov flow can be transcribed in a straightforward way to the setting of the finsler manifolds @xmath5 and @xmath70 .",
    "we also recall that gromov hyperbolicity is a property of the large - scale geometry of a metric space . in the case of a geodesic metric space",
    "( that is , a metric space in which distances between points are realized by length of curves joining them ) , the property says that triangles are uniformly @xmath239-thin , that is , that there exists a @xmath240 such that for any triangle , any side is contained in the @xmath239-neighborhood of the two others .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it follows from theorem [ th : gromov ] that convex real projective structures on a given closed manifold @xmath63 are either all strictly convex or they are all non - strictly convex .",
    "the _ topological entropy _ of a flow @xmath241 on a compact manifold @xmath234 with distance function @xmath242 is defined as follows .",

    "the strict convexity ensures that in the local projective charts , any geodesic is contained in a projective line , and therefore there are unique geodesics between any two given points .",
    "benoist started the study of this flow in @xcite and he showed that it is anosov and topologically mixing , generalizing properties which were known to hold for the geodesic flow associated to a hyperbolic manifold .",

    "there are several interesting global questions concerning the long - term behaviour of orbits and more generally the dynamics and the ergodic theory of anosov flows .",
    "some of these questions are considered by crampon @xcite who continued the study initiated by benoist .",

    "its topological entropy satisfies @xmath259 with equality if and only if @xmath63 is a hyperbolic manifold with constant curvature @xmath118 .",
    "some of the results of crampon are developed in detail in chapter 7 of this volume @xcite .",
    "the regularity of the boundary of the convex set plays an important role in the study of the geodesic flow .",
    "we recalled in  [ s : leng ] that it was proved in @xcite that if two strictly convex compact real projective manifolds have the same length spectrum with respect to the hilbert metric , then they are projectively equivalent , up to dual structures . thus , the length spectrum can be used as a parameter space for real projective structures up to dual structures .",
    "the length spectrum , and more generally , the set of geodesics in the manifold , or the space of geodesics in the universal cover equipped with the action of the fundamental group , can be studied from various points of view : dynamical , measure theoretical , etc .",
    "we shall consider more particularly the case where the manifold is two - dimensional .",
    "we start by recalling the notion of geodesic current .",
    "let @xmath260 be a closed surface of genus at least two equipped with a strictly convex real projective structure .",
    "geodesic current _ on @xmath82 is a @xmath261-invariant borel measure on the set @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the diagonal set and where @xmath264 acts by interchanging the coordinates .",
    "equivalently , a geodesic current is an invariant transverse measure for the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of @xmath82 .",
    "the unit tangent bundle @xmath265 of @xmath82 can be seen as the quotient of the set of bi - infinite geodesics @xmath5 by the action of @xmath71 .",
    "geodesic \" denotes here the lines in the sense of projective geometry , but we also recall that in the case where @xmath5 is strictly convex ( and in fact , it suffices that @xmath9 does not contain two affinely independent non - empty open segments ) , the set of projective geodesics coincides with the set of geodesics ( in the sense of distance - minimizing curves ) for the associated hilbert metric . the equivalence between the above two definitions of a geodesic current is based on the fact that from any two distinct points in @xmath9 there is a unique projective geodesic in @xmath5 having these points as endpoints .",
    "the invariant transverse measures for the geodesic flow of @xmath82 are also the @xmath71-invariant invariant transverse measures of the geodesic flow on @xmath5 .",
    "there are methods for obtaining invariant measures for geodesic flows and we shall mention the bowen - margulis measure below . in the setting of riemannian manifolds of negative curvature ,",
    "there are classical methods for constructing transverse measures for geodesic flows , and the theory of such transverse measures is well developed .",
    "the methods have been adapted by several authors to the case of hilbert geometry . for more information on this subject",
    ", we refer the reader to the chapter by crampon in this volume @xcite .",
    "let @xmath266 be a holonomy representation associated to a real projective structure on @xmath82 .",
    "we now explain a method of constructing geodesic currents which originates in the work of ledrappier @xcite .",
    "we start with the fact that for a strictly convex projective structure , the boundary @xmath9 is @xmath45 , and we recall the definition of a busemann cocycle @xmath149 in this context , cf .",

    "this function is called the _ busemann function _ associated to the geodesic ray @xmath274 .",
    "since the geodesic ray between a point in @xmath5 and a point in @xmath9 is unique , one can think of the busemann function as a function on @xmath9 that depends on the choice of a basepoint in @xmath5 .",
    "the function changes by an additive constant when we change the basepoint . when @xmath5 is the unit disc ( i.e. the hyperbolic space ) , the value of @xmath275 is the signed distance between the two horospheres based at @xmath100 and passing by @xmath276 and by @xmath33 .",
    "one also talks about the _ busemann cocycle _",
    "@xmath277 associated to a point @xmath268 ; the reason for this terminology is the cocycle property expressed in equation ( [ cocycle ] ) below .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a systematic presentation of several properties of busemann functions .",
    "the group @xmath71 , being isomorphic to the fundamental group of a closed surface of genus @xmath220 , is hyperbolic in the sense of gromov ( meaning that its cayley graph with respect to some  or , equivalently to any  finite generating system , equipped with the word metric , is a hyperbolic geodesic metric space ) .",
    "such a group has a well - defined gromov boundary .",
    "such a boundary carries a natural hlder structure , see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the _ translation length _ of @xmath193 , denoted by @xmath280 , is defined as @xmath281 checking the translation length of a group element is generally a pleasant exercise .    the attracting fixed point at infinity of @xmath193",

    "the _ period _ of @xmath292 at @xmath193 is defined to be @xmath293",

    "we recalled the definition of the topological entropy of a flow in  [ entropy ] .",

    "<S> we review some basic concepts related to convex real projective structures from the differential geometry point of view . </S>",
    "<S> we start by recalling a riemannian metric which originates in the study of affine spheres using the blaschke connection ( work of calabi and of cheng - yau ) mentioning its relation with the hilbert metric . </S>",
    "<S> we then survey some of the deformation theory of convex real projective structures on surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we describe in particular how the set of ( hilbert ) lengths of simple closed curves is used in a parametrization of the deformation space in analogy with the classical fenchel - nielsen parameters of teichmller space ( work of goldman ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then mention parameters of this deformation space that arise in the work of hitchin on the character variety of representations of the fundamental group of the surface in @xmath0 . in this character variety , </S>",
    "<S> the component of the character variety that corresponds to projective structures is identified with the vector space of pairs of holomorphic quadratic and cubic differentials over a fixed riemann surface . </S>",
    "<S> labourie and loftin ( independently ) obtained parameter spaces that use the cubic differentials and affine spheres . </S>",
    "<S> we then display some similarities and differences between hilbert geometry and hyperbolic geometry using geodesic currents and topological entropy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss geodesic flows associated to hilbert metrics and compactifications of spaces of convex real projective structures on surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this makes another analogy with works done on the teichmller space of the surface .    </S>",
