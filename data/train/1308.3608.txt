    "a cilium which means an eyelash in latin , is motile ( although not all cilia motile ) hairlike slender appendage / sprotuberance that project from the free surfaces of certain cells ( e , g .",
    "eukaryotic cells ) and is present in almost all groups of the animal kingdom .",
    "because of its motility , it plays an important role in diverse physiological processes such as locomotion , alimentation , circulation , respiration and reproduction .",
    "there are two types of cilia namely motile cilia and non - motile or primary cilia .",
    "however , the motile cilia which do not beat randomly but are coordinated are taken into consideration in this study .",
    "this nature of the cilia gives extremely interesting aspects of ciliated epithelium .",
    "a summary of general observations and conclusions on the cilia of the gill of several aquatic species was given by rivera @xcite as : ( a ) in any given tissue , the rate of beat of all the cilia is remarkably uniform .",
    "( b ) the lashings of a single cilium and of cilia on adjacent cells appear to be definitely coordinated .",
    "( c ) a definite metachronal wave is established .",
    "metachronal rhythm is a movement where there is always a sequence of beat from row to row of cilia in a given row of cells and from one row of cells to the next , so that any small foreign body resting on the ciliated surface is progressively moved always in the same direction .",
    "since a metachronal wave provides a more `` steady progression of water over the ciliated surface or perhaps because it is not practical to excite a synchronous beat over a large area '' ( sleigh @xcite ) , it is widely believed that cilia beat in a metachronal wave rather than synchronously .",
    "however , the metachronal wave along a ciliated surface can change its pattern ( sleigh @xcite ) .",
    "the change depends on whether the metachronal waves travel in the same direction as the effective stroke of the ciliary beat ( symplectic metachronism ) , or the metachronal waves travel in the opposite direction to the effective stroke of the beat and thus opposite to the movement of fluid ( antiplectic metachronism ) , or the cilia beat at right angles to the line of wave progression ( diaplectic metachronism ) .",
    "satir @xcite showed an example of a diaplectic metaehronal wave in figure 6 of his study @xcite , while some data based on wave lengths , metachronal wave velocities and frequencies are available for lower animal forms ( sleigh @xcite ) .",
    "it is to be noted that data do not appear to be readily obtainable for higher animal species , especially mammals .",
    "however , it was measured that the beat frequency for cilia lining in the rabbit oviduct is approximately 20 - 30 beats / sec ( borell et al .",
    "it is important to mention that this order of magnitude of the frequency is comparable with frequencies of cilia beat of lower forms ( sleigh @xcite ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the investigations on the hydrodynamics of protozoa which use cilia for locomotion have being carried out by many investigators ( c.f .",
    "jahn and bovee @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "blake @xcite considered a spherical envelope model for the swimming of the protozoan opalina and the swimming motion of either a two - dimensional or cylindrical ciliated body .",
    "miller @xcite worked on the problem of mucus transport in the trachea by the use of a mechanical simulation of the cilia in the trachea , while an analytical model for mucus transport in the trachea had been presented by barton and raynor @xcite without consideration of the metachronal wave motion .",
    "these studies in protozoology and mucus transport in the respiratory tract supplied information on the means of locomotion in protozoa and particle transport in the respiratory tract .",
    "however , only a little work has been done to relate the properties of the cilia and the metachronal wave to the net fluid transport in tubules .",
    "our motivation is coming from problems associated with the understanding of the transport of fluid through the ductus efferentes of the human male reproductive tract ( greep @xcite ) and the effect of cilia on ovum and sperm transport in the fallopian tubes ( blandau @xcite ) , ( sturgis @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , this paper will deal with a comparison of the results for the flow rates of our model to the flow rates estimated in the ductus efferentes of the male reproductive tract .",
    "it is to be noted that there are only a few data available on the flow rates due to ciliary activity .",
    "based on the experimental determinations ( tuck et al .",
    "@xcite , waites and setchell @xcite , setchell @xcite ) , lardner and shack @xcite estimated flow rate as @xmath5 with approximate values of @xmath6 , frequency of beat of the cilia as 20/sec for human testes , while the theoretical model of lardner and shack @xcite obtained a flow rate of @xmath7 .",
    "hence further studies are required for considerable improvements .",
    "past experimental observations indicate that most of the biological fluids possess non - newtonian behaviour @xcite .",
    "so , analysis on the basis of simple newtonian fluid non accurate results .",
    "the power law model is one of the simplest but the most widely used model for rheological fluid transports @xcite .",
    "the rheological nature of this model is strongly dependent on rehological fluid index @xmath4 and the model approximates both shear - thinning ( @xmath8 ) and shear - thickening ( @xmath9 ) fluids behaviour over a large range of flow conditions @xcite .",
    "viscous properties of human semen is experimentaly found to exhibit power law - behaviour [ dunn and picologlu @xcite , mendeluk et al .",
    "it has been reported experimently that semen proves to fit in a power - law model with pseudoplastic behavior @xcite .",
    "thus studies on fluid transport of the power law model by ciliary activity may be useful to draw some important conclusions .",
    "recently , siddiqui et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the flow of a power law fluid due to ciliary motion in an infinite channel and remarked that the power - law fluid gives results closer to the estimated one as @xmath5 .",
    "however , we believe that there are some drawbacks in their claim .",
    "they took @xmath10 , giving reference to agarwal and anawaruddin @xcite who reported an application of theirs model to fluid transport in vas deference considering @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to mention that ductus efferentes and vas deferens are quite different ducts , while we have no idea about the possibility of @xmath10 for the later case .",
    "however , @xmath0 , a non - dimensional measure with respect to mean radius @xmath1 of the tube and the cilia length , would be much less than @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "to the authors knowledge , the other drawbacks of the results in @xcite are : ( i ) they considered large favourable pressure gradient which was constant . it is well known that pressure gradient in small biological vessels ( at least when there is a wave like peristaltic wave @xcite , metachronal wave etc in the vessels ) varies with the length of the vessels and large favourable pressure gradient are physiologically insignificant , in general , and , at least , in the ductus efferentes ( @xcite ) ( ii ) dependence of flow characteristics on @xmath11 , wave number of the metachronal wave , is not true for higher values of @xmath11 as they have done their analysis for small values of @xmath11 etc .",
    "however , their power law model is somehow different and complex to the widely used power - law model .    in view of all the above , a theoretical model for the flow in an axisymmetric tube due to",
    "metachronal wave of cilia motion has been taken into consideration for more realistic consequences .",
    "a study concerning the analysis of a non - linear problem of ostwald - de waele power - law fluid transport has been undertaken here by means of a sequence of cilia beat from row - to - row of cilia in a given row of cells and from one row of cells to the next ( metachronal wave movement ) under the conditions that the reynolds number is small and the wave number is large .    based upon the analytical investigation , the velocity , pressure difference , flow rate have been formulated and extensive numerical calculations have been made thereafter .",
    "keeping in view a specific situation of fluid movement in micro - vessels by ciliary motion , the computational results are presented in graphical forms .",
    "the results presented for shear thinning and shear thickening fluids are quite relevant in the context of various studies of fluid transport due to ciliary activity .",
    "for example , semen usually behaves like shear thinning fluid when it contains a number of spermatozoa up to certain limit , however in the case of heavily concentrated spermatozoa suspensions , the fluid behaviour may be considered similar to that of a shear thickening fluid @xcite .",
    "moulik et al .",
    "@xcite reported that high viscosity of semen can be an indication of antibodies in the plasma and/or genital tract infection .",
    "some novel features may be reported in this study by which we can have a better insight of fluid motion by ciliary activity .",
    "ciliary pumping mechanism may be utilized in the study the hydrodynamics of protozoa which use cilia for locomotion .",
    "the results may find useful applications for the possible use of cilia - based actuators as micro - mixers , for flow control in tiny bio - sensors , or as micro - pumps for drug - delivery systems .    in this investigation , the term cilia , as it is used , is limited to clliated epithelium and will not include flagella ; comparative physiology of flagella including sperm tails may be found in the papers by fawcett @xcite and by sleigh @xcite .",
    "a non - linear problem concerning the fluid transport characteristics in an axisymmetric tube under the action of ciliary beat that generate a metachronal wave will be studied here , by considering the fluid as an incompressible viscous non - newtonian fluid .",
    "let us consider an axisymmetric tube with ciliated walls of large length compared with its radius and a symplectic metachronal wave moves to the right with wave velocity c. the non - newtonian viscous fluid behaviour within the tube is treated as an incompressible viscous ostwald - de waele power law type of rheological fluids .",
    "we treat ( r,@xmath12,z ) as the cylindrical coordinates of the location of any fluid particle , r being the radius of the tube , the coordinate z measured in the direction of wave propagation and @xmath12 being the rotational coordinate .",
    "if @xmath13 be the stress tensor and @xmath14 the symmetric rate of deformation tensor , the constitutive equation of shear stress for the ostwald - de waele power law fluid can be written as @xmath15 @xmath16 in which @xmath17 and @xmath4 denote respectively the consistency factor and the power - law index parameter , depicting the behaviour of the fluid ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the velocity components in the @xmath20 and @xmath1 directions .",
    "it is well known that a shear thinning fluid is classified by @xmath8 , while for a shear thickening fluid , @xmath9 .",
    "based on the above consideration , the motion of an incompressible viscous ostwald - de waele power - law fluid in an axisymmetric tube together with equation of continuity may be considered to be governed by the equations @xmath21",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the density and pressure of the fluid .",
    "keeping the view on the geometry of the metachronal wave pattern , it is assumed that the envelope of the cilia tips can be written mathematically in the following form : @xmath26 which can be therefore assumed as the the equation of the extensible channel wall , where  @xmath27  denotes the mean radius of the tube , @xmath0 is a non - dimensional measure with respect to ` @xmath27 ' of the cilia length , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 stand for the wave length and wave velocity of the metachronal wave . based upon the different patterns of cilia motion observed in sleigh ( 1968 ) ,",
    "the cilia tips can be considered to move in elliptical paths such that the horizontal position of a cilia tip can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents a reference position of the particle and @xmath17 stands for a measure of the eccentricity of the elliptical motion . under the no slip conditions ,",
    "the velocities imparted to fluid particles are just those of the cilia tips and hence the axial and vertical velocities of the cilia can be given by @xmath32 if equations ( [ cnsns_manuscript_envelope_cilia_tip ] ) and ( [ cnsns_manuscript_envelope_cilia_tip_horizontal ] ) are applied to equations ( [ cnsns_manuscript_cilia_velo_horizontal_equ ] ) and ( [ cnsns_manuscript_cilia_velo_vertical_equ ] ) , we have @xmath33 these boundary conditions enable us to distinguish between the effective stroke of the cilia and the slow less effective recovery stroke by approximately accounting for the shortening of the cilia . in other wards , we can say that the tube is narrower when @xmath18 is positive .    for a wave frame ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) moving with a velocity c away from a fixed frame ( @xmath20,@xmath1 ) ,",
    "let us take the transformations @xmath36 in which ( @xmath37,@xmath38 ) and ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) are the velocity components , @xmath39 and @xmath25 stand for pressure in wave frame and fixed frame of reference respectively .",
    "henceforward , we shall make use of the following non - dimensional variables : @xmath40 if we drop the bars over these symbols , the equations governing the flow of the fluid can be rewritten as @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 whereas the boundary conditions are @xmath45 on @xmath46 .    since in most of the cases of flow in small diameter tubules ,",
    "reynolds numbers are very small ( @xmath47 ) , the analysis can be carried out by the approximation of the inertia - free flow . in this case , the governing equations under the consideration of the long - wavelength approximation can be simplified as follows : @xmath48 @xmath49 and also the forms of the boundary conditions will now be @xmath50 on @xmath46 . by solving ( [ cnsns_manuscript_zmomentum_lubrication ] ) subject to the boundary condition ( [ cnsns_manuscript_cilia_velo_horizontal ] ) , we have found the axial velocity in the form @xmath51 \\label{cnsns_manuscript_cilia_axial_velocity}\\ ] ] if we integrate the continuity ( 19 ) across the cross section of the tube , we get @xmath52 this shows that the volume flow rate @xmath53 in the wave frame of reference is constant . on integration ( [ cnsns_manuscript_cilia_axial_velocity ] ) across the cross section of the tube",

    "the ciliated walls of an axisymmetric tube have been modelled by an metachronal wave of cilium which is equivalent to a wavy wall of peristaltic transport .",
    "there is only a few available data in the existing literature on the flow rates due to the ciliary activity .",
    "the relationship between the pressure difference and the time - mean - volume flow through an axisymmetric tube is given in ( [ cnsns_manuscript_cilia_pressure_rise_relation ] ) .",
    "we have to test if the results of ( [ cnsns_manuscript_cilia_pressure_rise_relation ] ) are applicable to the flow rates observed in the ductus efferentes of the male reproductive tract . in the human ,",
    "the ductuli efferentes are 10 - 15 tubules connecting the rete testis to the epididymis and the cells lining these tubules are ciliated .",
    "it is generally believed that the cilia are responsible for fluid transport @xcite . on the basis of experimental observations @xcite on the flow rates in the rete testis of rat , ram , and bull ,",
    "the approximate flow rate in human rete testis per ductus efferentes was estimated by lardner and shack @xcite as @xmath881 0@xmath89 @xmath3 with approximate dimensions of @xmath90 , with frequency of beat of the cilia being 20/sec and @xmath91 .",
    "the said values justify the use of long wavelength and small reynolds number theory ( @xmath47 ) of the study .",
    "lardner and shack @xcite calculated the non - dimensional flow rate and dimensional flow rate as @xmath92 and @xmath9310@xmath89 @xmath3 respectively from their model in the case of free pumping assuming @xmath74 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , if we consider all these values fixed with our model together with @xmath62 , our model gives the non - dimensional flow rate in an axisymmetric tube as @xmath94 and consequently the dimensional flow rate is @xmath9510@xmath89 @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "[ cnsns_manuscript_pump7.1.1 - 7.4.1]a ) .",
    "these values , for an axisymmetric tube are twice the values reported by lardner and shack @xcite for a two - dimensional channel .",
    "thus a considerable improvement is needed .",
    "however , @xmath0 is linearly proportional to the cilia length on the basis of the assumption and @xmath4 is linked to the rehological fluid ( widely known as non - newtonian fluid ) in the ductus efferentes of the male reproductive tract .",
    "it has been seen from fig .",
    "[ cnsns_manuscript_pump7.1.1 - 7.4.1 ] that the flow rates increase significantly with an increase in @xmath0 .",
    "the flow rates increase with cilia length was also reported in @xcite .",
    "moreover , for higher values of @xmath0 , rheological fluid index @xmath4 remarkably affect the fluid transport for adverse pressure gradient at pumping zone .",
    "in addition , if we consider @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath81 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 then the non - dimensional flow rate and dimensional flow rate are calculated as @xmath98 and @xmath9910@xmath89 @xmath3 respectively which is close to the estimated value @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "but authors have no idea about the actual length of cilia and hence the value of @xmath0 , due to non - availibility of real physiological data of the concerned variables and parameters esed in the analysis .",
    "an analysis for the rheological fluid transport by means of a sequence of beat of cilia which are in an array and coordinated in such a way as to represent the metachronal wave is presented .",
    "the objective of the present study is related to the problems associated with the understanding of the fluid transport through the ductus efferentes of the human male reproductive tract ( @xcite ) and the effect of cilia on ovum and sperm transport in the fallopian tubes etc .",
    "however aonly n application of the our results for flow rates to the observed flow rates in the ductus efferentes of the reproductive tract is discussed here . on the basis of the derived analytical expressions ,",
    "extensive numerical computations have been carried out .",
    "the effects of various parameters , such as @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath11 , @xmath17 on pumping characteristic and velocity distribution are investigated in detail in the case of an axisymmetric tube flow .",
    "the study reveals that for a particular set of values , say @xmath74 , @xmath100 , @xmath66 , @xmath62 , @xmath81 , as considered in @xcite , flow rate in an axisymmetric tube is twice the value reported by lardner and shack @xcite for a two - dimensional channel .",
    "it further reveals that the flow rate changes remarkably with @xmath0 and @xmath4 and when @xmath0 is near by 0.5 our results of flow rate in human ductus efferentes are close to the estimated value @xmath2 @xmath3 as suggested by lardner and shack @xcite based on the experimental observations on the flow rates in the ductus efferentes in the other animals e.g. rat , ram , and bull .",
    "the considerable difference between the theoretical and the observed values indicates that the metachronal wave of cilia can not account for the total flow rate in ductus efferents and there must be some other important factors , responsible for the transport of semen",
    ". these factors may be ( cf . ilio and hess @xcite ) ( a ) contraction of smooth muscle ( b ) constant secretion of fluid by the seminiferous epithelium ( c ) contraction of the myoepithelial layer of the seminiferous tubule and tunica albuginea of the testis ( d ) the vacuum created by the ejaculation of sperm from the lower tract and by the absorption of fluid ( e ) increased pressure due to the pattern of branching and convergence of ductuli .",
    "consequently , to understand the mechanism involved in transport of semen in ductus efferentes of male repductive tract adequately , further theoretical and experimental investigations are essential .",
    "it is important to mention that forward flow takes place at the wider portion of the tube , while backward flow occurs at narrower portion of the tube in a similar fashion of peristaltic transport @xcite , although forward flow is dominant for positive time - averaged flow . +",
