    "electron spin - polarized hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) has extreme quantum nature due to its very small mass and weakly attractive potential .",
    "it remains in gas phase even in the limit of zero temperature and up to pressures of about 170 bar ,  @xcite after which it solidifies .",
    "stwalley and nosanow  @xcite suggested in 1976 the use of h@xmath0 for achieving a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) state , which was finally achieved for hydrogen in 1998 by fried _",
    "et al._.  @xcite heavier isotopes of hydrogen , spin - polarized deuterium ( d@xmath0 ) and tritium ( t@xmath0 ) also show a remarkable quantum behavior .",
    "d@xmath0 atoms , which obey fermi statistics , have nuclear spin one and thus the zero - pressure state of bulk d@xmath0 depends on the number of occupied nuclear spin states .",
    "previous theoretical estimations  @xcite have shown that ( d@xmath1 ) with only one occupied nuclear spin state is gas at zero pressure , while bulk d@xmath0 with two ( d@xmath2 ) and three ( d@xmath3 ) equally occupied nuclear spin states remains liquid at zero pressure and zero temperature .",
    "spin - polarized tritium , which obeys bose statistics , is expected to be liquid  @xcite due to its larger mass .",
    "recently , blume _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied microscopic properties of tritium ( t@xmath0)@xmath4 clusters with up to @xmath5=40 atoms using the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method and compared them to bosonic @xmath6he@xmath4 clusters . in that work , it is shown that tritium clusters ( t@xmath0)@xmath4 are even more weakly bound than helium clusters @xmath6he@xmath4 with the same number of atoms . furthermore , their results suggest the use of t@xmath0 as a new bec gas with the advantage of a nearly exact knowledge of its interatomic potential and the possibility of manipulating the strength of the interactions via feshbach resonances .",
    "in addition , it has been shown  @xcite that the trimer ( t@xmath0)@xmath7 is the smallest spin - polarized tritium cluster with a ground - state energy of only @xmath8 mk .",
    "it is thus an example of borromean or halo state ,  @xcite because the two - body t@xmath0 system does not have a bound state .",
    "the prediction of a total zero angular momentum bound state of the spin - polarized atomic tritium trimer has been recently confirmed by salci _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using the finite element method .",
    "importantly , the use of this accurate few - body approach leads to conclude that there are not any other bound or shape resonant states with zero and nonzero angular momentum .",
    "@xcite    unlike the case of pure @xmath9he , @xmath6he and mixed @xmath9he-@xmath6he clusters , which have been the subject of both experimental and theoretical study ,  @xcite nothing is known about the stability of mixed or other pure spin - polarized hydrogen clusters different from tritium ones .",
    "@xmath9he has almost the same mass as t@xmath0 , but because of its small mass and fermi statistics it takes at least 30 @xmath9he atoms to form a bound state .",
    "@xcite recently , hanna and blume  @xcite have studied the near - threshold behavior of weekly bound three - dimensional bosonic clusters with up to 40 atoms interacting additively through two - body van der waals potentials modeled after the t@xmath0-t@xmath0 interaction . among other results , they found a four - parameter fit for the critical mass needed to bind a bosonic cluster of @xmath5 atoms . from this , it follows that if d@xmath0 were a boson , due to its smaller mass compared to t@xmath0 , it would take at least 13 atoms to form a bound cluster ( d@xmath10 . considering",
    "that d@xmath0 obeys fermi statistics we expect that , similarly to the case of @xmath9he ,  @xcite it will take more than 30 d@xmath0 atoms to form a self - bound cluster . on the other hand , although h@xmath0 obeys bose statistics , its approximately three times larger zero - point energy ( with respect to t@xmath0 ) implies that clusters of h@xmath0 are not stable .",
    "@xcite this statement is in agreement with the gas nature of bulk h@xmath0 at zero temperature .",
    "@xcite therefore , hydrogen - tritium and deuterium - tritium clusters are reasonable choices for getting stable self - bound spin - polarized clusters .    if tritium could be experimentally prepared to achieve a bec state , as suggested in ref . , the presence of a finite fraction of deuterium would be a new example of a bose - fermi mixture with bec .",
    "in fact , bose - fermi mixtures composed with alkalines are nowadays studied in several laboratories and the main physics underlying them is well known .",
    "@xcite tritium - deuterium mixtures would be even more interesting since they are isotopic and with a very well known interaction .",
    "dilute vapors are also candidates for searching the elusive efimov states ,  @xcite and recently experimental evidence of its existence has been observed in an ultracold gas of cesium atoms .",
    "@xcite in the case of pure tritium , it has been proved that such state does not exist  @xcite but mixed isotopic hydrogen systems could offer new possibilities for continuing the search of trimers with efimov character .    in this article , we report energetic and structural properties of small spin - polarized tritium - deuterium and tritium - hydrogen clusters , obtained using the diffusion monte carlo method .",
    "it is our main goal to determine which of these clusters are stable .",
    "as many of them extend beyond the classically forbidden region they can be considered as quantum halo systems .",
    "we are particularly interested in finding among these halo clusters mixed borromean or \" super - borromean ",
    "@xcite systems for which all subsystems are unbound .",

    "ii , we briefly describe the dmc method and the trial wave functions used for importance sampling . due to the fermionic nature of d@xmath0 , the fixed - node and released - node methods",
    "are used in cases where the wave function has nodes . sec .",
    "iii reports the results obtained , and finally , sec .",
    "iv comprises the summary of the results and main conclusions .",
    "we consider that all the h@xmath0 , d@xmath0 , and t@xmath0 atoms interact with the spin - independent central triplet pair potential @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "this interaction has been determined in an essentially exact way by kolos and wolniewicz ,  @xcite and recently extended to larger interparticle distances by jamieson _",
    "et al . _ ( jdw ) .",
    "@xcite we have used a cubic spline interpolation between jdw data and smoothly connected the points to the long - range behavior as calculated by yan _",
    "et al._.  @xcite the same form has been used in the recent dmc calculation of bulk h@xmath0,@xcite work in which a comparison between different potentials employed in the past is also reported . on the other hand ,",
    "we have checked that the addition of mass - dependent adiabatic corrections ( as calculated by kolos and rychlewski  @xcite ) to the jdw potential does not modify the energy of spin - polarized hydrogen clusters .",
    "the starting point of the dmc method is the schrdinger equation written in imaginary time , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant acting as a reference energy , @xmath16 is a _",
    "walker _ in monte carlo terminology , and @xmath17 is the @xmath5-particle hamiltonian @xmath18    as usual in the method , a trial wave function @xmath19 is introduced for importance sampling and then the schrdinger equation ( [ srodin ] ) is rewritten in terms of @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting equation is solved stochastically by considering a short - time approximation for the green s function . in the limit @xmath21 ( for long simulation times ) , only the lowest energy eigenfunction not orthogonal to @xmath22 survives and then the sampling of the ground state is effectively achieved .",
    "the trial wave function used for the simulation of the pure t@xmath0 clusters is of jastrow form , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 describes correlations between pairs of tritium atoms .",
    "similarly , wave functions for the study of mixed tritium - hydrogen clusters , containing @xmath25 h@xmath0 atoms and @xmath26 t@xmath0 atoms ( @xmath27 ) , are constructed as a product of two - body correlation functions between all the pairs , @xmath28 where @xmath29 describes the two - body correlations between h@xmath0 atoms and @xmath30 accounts for the h@xmath0-t@xmath0 pairs . in case of",
    "mixed ( d@xmath0)@xmath31(t@xmath0)@xmath32 clusters , the total wave - function is constructed as a product of an antisymmetric function corresponding to deuterium ( @xmath33 ) and jastrow factors , @xmath34 where @xmath35 describes two - body correlations between d@xmath0 atoms and @xmath36 two - body correlations for the d@xmath0-t@xmath0 pairs . for the function",
    "@xmath33 it is enough to consider the product of slater determinants for each one of the nuclear spin states .",
    "consequently , @xmath33 has different form in the case of d@xmath2 and d@xmath3 mixed d@xmath0-t@xmath0 clusters .",
    "for example , in the case of ( d@xmath37(t@xmath38 clusters , @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath33=@xmath41 for @xmath42 , and @xmath33=@xmath43 for @xmath25=4 , while for ( d@xmath44(@xmath45 clusters @xmath39 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 for @xmath25=4 and @xmath33=@xmath43 for @xmath25=5 .",
    "we have worked with three different models for the two - body correlation function @xmath48 , @xmath49 \\ , \\label{trial1}\\ ] ] @xmath50 \\ , \\label{trial2}\\ ] ] @xmath51 \\ , \\label{trial3}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath12 are variational parameters .",
    "they have been obtained by optimizing the variational energy calculated with the vmc method .",
    "finally , we found the form ( [ trial2 ] ) to be optimal for clusters from three to five t@xmath0 atoms , while the other two ( [ trial1],[trial3 ] ) suit better for larger clusters . the same function , with different variational parameters ,",
    "has then been used for all the other two - body correlation functions ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath30 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "for example , in case of pure t@xmath0 clusters @xmath60 range from ( 3.9,4.0,0.0012 ) for trimer to ( 4.0,3.7,0.001 ) for ( t@xmath61 and @xmath62 range from ( 3.55,0.065 ) for ( t@xmath63 to ( 3.6,0.05 ) for ( t@xmath64 .",
    "the vmc recovers from 70% to 90% of the dmc energy , except in case of ( t@xmath65 where the vmc energy is only -0.85(8 ) mk . in case of mixed clusters",
    "the parameters in the @xmath48 function do not change significantly , so for example in case of the form ( [ trial3 ] ) @xmath12 assumes values from 3.5 to 3.62 and @xmath57 from 0.07 to 0.05 , going from smaller to larger clusters , respectively .",
    "at the same time , in the function @xmath66 , @xmath12 goes from 3.58 to 3.7 and @xmath57 is around 0.003",
    ". similar behavior of variational parameter @xmath12 is obtained for the other correlation functions , while @xmath57 is around 0.01 in @xmath36 and around 0.003 in @xmath35 . in most cases of mixed clusters",
    "vmc recovers from 60% to 90% of the dmc energy , exceptions being smaller clusters with more than two d@xmath0 atoms and the clusters having only three t@xmath0 atoms , where the vmc energies are further from the dmc ones .",
    "the dmc method we have used is accurate to second order in the time step @xmath67 .",
    "@xcite the ground - state energies have been calculated for several time - steps and then extrapolated to zero @xmath67 to remove any possible time - step bias .",
    "we have also studied the optimal mean walker population and finally chosen @xmath68 in order to eliminate any bias coming from it .    apart from statistical uncertainties , the energy of the bosonic clusters is exactly calculated . in the case of mixed clusters with more than three d@xmath3 or two d@xmath2 atoms , the sign problem appears because the trial wave function changes sign .",
    "since the monte carlo method requires that @xmath69 , we have first used the so - called fixed - node approximation which allows only the moves in which @xmath70 and @xmath71 change sign together , thus fixing the nodes . in this way , an upper bound to the energy",
    "is obtained .",
    "@xcite in a subsequent step , we have removed the nodal constraint imposed by the trial wave function by using the released - node method .",
    "we have adopted the methodology used previously in liquid helium calculations ,  @xcite and recently employed in the study of small mixed helium clusters .",
    "@xcite in this approach , walkers are allowed to cross the nodes imposed by the trial wave function and survive for a finite lifetime .",
    "in order to achieve an effective crossing of the nodal surface an auxiliary guiding wave function @xmath72 is introduced in the dmc calculation .",
    "this function is positive everywhere , different from zero in the nodes , and approaches @xmath73 away from the nodes . like in refs .",
    ", we have taken @xmath74 , which satisfies the above condition for suitable choices of @xmath75 .",
    "the released - node energy is estimated through an exponential fit @xmath76 to the dmc data , with @xmath77 the released time . in all cases where the rn method is used in this work",
    "the difference between the last calculated point in released time and @xmath78 is of the same order as the statistical noise . the behavior of @xmath75 and the maximum released time needed to achieve the asymptotic limit of the released energy has been similar to the case studied in ref .",
    "also , like in ref . , we find the rn energies to be very close to the fn ones .",
    "in addition , in the case of @xmath79 we have verified that the inclusion of backflow correlations in @xmath33 does not change the final fn results .",
    "dmc results for the ground state energy of pure and mixed t@xmath0-h@xmath0 clusters are given in table [ tab : energiesth ] .",
    "our results for pure tritium t@xmath0 clusters are compared to the results of blume _ et .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : blume ] . we obtain a good agreement with these published data , although our results are slightly lower for all @xmath5 . underlying this difference is the fact that in ref .",
    "a damped three - body axilrod - teller potential term  @xcite is introduced in the hamiltonian , raising the trimer energy 1.6% and the energy of the cluster with 40 particles 6% .",
    "we also find that the trimer is the smallest spin - polarized tritium cluster with an energy of only @xmath80 mk , confirming it to be a halo state . in order to test the sensitivity of the present results to the details in the interaction potential ,",
    "we have also calculated the energy with the potential that silvera and goldman  @xcite constructed as a fit to the older kolos and wolniewicz data .  @xcite it is worth mentioning that a full comparison between the different potentials used in the literature for studying bulk h@xmath0 can be found in the ref . .",
    "using the silvera model , we obtain a trimer binding energy significantly smaller , @xmath81 mk .",
    "the trimer energy is therefore sizably affected by the interatomic potential and the reason for that lies on the huge cancellation between the kinetic and potential energies .",
    "for instance , using the jdw potential and the pure estimator for the potential energy , we obtain @xmath82 mk and @xmath83 mk . for larger clusters , the influence of the potential form on the binding strength",
    "is reduced : for the tetramer and with the silvera potential , we obtain an energy @xmath84 mk which is only about 15% weaker than the one for the jdw potential , @xmath85 mk .",
    "the potential and kinetic energies of the tetramer using the jdw potential are @xmath86 mk and @xmath87 mk .",
    "the addition of one h@xmath0 atom to the ( t@xmath10 cluster creates a system that appears to be at the threshold of stability or unstable , that is the ground - state energy of the ( t@xmath10h@xmath0 cluster is within the errorbars equal to or higher than the energy of the ( t@xmath10 cluster , respectively . in order to be certain about the conclusion concerning the stability of the ( t@xmath10h@xmath0 clusters",
    ", we have repeated the calculations using two different types of trial wave functions . in the case where vmc energies are",
    "further away from the dmc ones , a lot of simulation time is needed for the system to reach the equilibrium state , and in some cases with the trial function ( [ trial2 ] ) the lowering of the energy with imaginary time going on is almost imperceptible . on the other hand , with both ( [ trial1 ] ) and ( [ trial3 ] ) , and for small values of the parameter @xmath57 or @xmath54 in the @xmath88 function ,",
    "the system rather quickly reaches the equilibrium energy , which is within the errorbars equal to the energy of the system without the h@xmath0 atom . furthermore ,",
    "if we continue the simulation after the system has reached the ground - state energy , we can observe the surplus h@xmath0 atom leaving the cluster .",
    "this indicates that these clusters are effectively unstable .",
    "we have also calculated the ground - state energies of several clusters with more hydrogen atoms ( t@xmath10(h@xmath89 , such that @xmath90 .",
    "our results indicate that these clusters are also unstable , because although in some cases negative energies are obtained they are above those for ( t@xmath10h@xmath0 .",
    "table [ tab : energiestd ] presents the results for the ground - state energy of mixed t@xmath0-d@xmath0 clusters . due to the approximately twice larger mass of d@xmath0 compared to h@xmath0 , clusters with one or two d@xmath0 atoms and at least three t@xmath0 atoms are stable . in the clusters ( t@xmath10(d@xmath91 , we have assumed that d@xmath0 atoms occupy two different nuclear spin states . for clusters ( t@xmath10(d@xmath89 with @xmath922 , we have considered both the case where two different nuclear spin states are occupied ( t@xmath10(d@xmath93 and the case with three different occupied nuclear spin states ( t@xmath10(d@xmath94 . similar to the case of the bulk system ,",

    "furthermore , ( t@xmath10(d@xmath99 , whose spatial wave function has no nodes , are all stable for @xmath100 , while it takes 6 t@xmath0 atoms to form a stable ( t@xmath10(d@xmath101 cluster .",
    "the smaller ( t@xmath10(d@xmath101 clusters have the same energy as the ( t@xmath10(d@xmath91 clusters within the errorbars , but the analysis of the distributions shows one of the d@xmath0 atoms leaving the system . the clusters ( t@xmath10(d@xmath102 are similarly at the threshold of binding for @xmath103 , just like the clusters ( t@xmath10(d@xmath104 , and",
    "again it is necessary to consider the structure to better determine their stability .",
    "our analysis indicates that only ( t@xmath63(d@xmath102 is stable .",
    "the same behavior , as far as the energy is concerned , is reproduced for ( t@xmath10(d@xmath105 with @xmath106 : as the separation of the d@xmath0 atoms is growing along the simulation we are led to consider them unstable .",
    "we expect that all other clusters ( t@xmath10(d@xmath89 , with @xmath107 and @xmath108 are unstable because the exchange of t@xmath0 with the d@xmath0 atoms does not change the interaction but raises the kinetic energy . the evolution of the energy of mixed clusters formed by @xmath5 tritium atoms and one hydrogen atom or up to four deuterium atoms is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allen ] .",
    "in addition to the energy , dmc simulations allow also for exact estimations of other relevant magnitudes such as the distribution of interparticle distances @xmath109 or the distribution of particles with respect to the center of mass of the cluster @xmath110 . in both cases it is possible to eliminate the bias coming from the trial wave function by using pure estimators  @xcite and arrive to exact results .",
