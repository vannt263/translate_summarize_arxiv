    ". _ we aim at finding a finite sequence of optimal stopping times @xmath0 which minimizes the quadratic variation of the discretization error of the stochastic integral @xmath1 which interpretation is the hedging error @xcite of the discrete delta - hedging strategy of a european option with underlying asset @xmath2 ( multidimensional it process ) , maturity @xmath3 , price function @xmath4 ( for the ease of presentation , here @xmath4 depends only on  @xmath2 ) and payoff @xmath5 .",
    "the times @xmath6 read as rebalancing dates ( or trading dates ) , and their number @xmath7 is a random variable which is finite the exponent @xmath8 refers to a control parameter introduced later on ; see section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "the minimization of @xmath9 is hopeless since after a suitable renormalization , it is known that it weakly converges to a mixture of gaussian random variables ( see @xcite when trading dates are deterministic and under some mild assumptions on the model and payoff ; see @xcite for stopping times under stronger assumptions ) .",
    "hence it is more appropriate to investigate the minimization of the quadratic variation @xmath10 which , owing to the lenglart inequality ( resp . , the burkholder  davis",
    " gundy inequality ) , allows the control of the distribution ( resp . ,",
    "the @xmath11-moments , @xmath12 ) of @xmath13 under martingale measure . to avoid trivial lower bounds by letting @xmath14 , we reformulate our problem into the minimization of the product @xmath15 as emphasized in @xcite , the resolution of this optimization problem allows the asymptotic minimization of more general costs of the form @xmath16 , where the function @xmath17 is increasing in both variables .",
    "our theorem [ th1 ] states that the renormalized error ( [ eq : critere ] ) has an asymptotic lower bound over the class of admissible strategies which consist ( roughly speaking . ] ) of deterministic times and of hitting times of random ellipsoids of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a measurable adapted positive - definite symmetric matrix process .",
    "it includes the karandikar scheme @xcite for discretization of stochastic integrals .",
    "in addition , in theorems [ th2 ] and [ th2:bis ] we show the existence of a strategy of the hitting time form attaining the lower bound .",
    "the derivation of a central limit - type theorem for @xmath20 is left to further research ( see @xcite ) , in particular because the verification of the criteria in @xcite is difficult to handle in our general setting .",
    "_ literature background_. our work extends the existing literature on discretization errors for stochastic integrals with deterministic time mesh , mainly considered with financial applications .",
    "many works deal with hedging rebalancing at regular intervals of length @xmath21 . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that @xmath22 $ ] converges to 0 at rate @xmath8 for payoffs smooth enough [ this convergence rate originates to consider the product ( [ eq : critere ] ) as a minimization criterion ] .",
    "however , in @xcite it is proved that the irregularity of the payoff may deteriorate the convergence rate : it becomes @xmath23 for digital call option .",
    "this phenomenon has been intensely analyzed by geiss and his co - authors using the concept of fractional smoothness ( see @xcite and references therein ) : by the choice of rebalancing dates suitably concentrated at maturity , we recover the rate @xmath8 .",
    "the first attempt to find optimal strategies with nondeterministic times goes back to @xcite : the authors allow a fixed number @xmath8 of random rebalancing dates , which actually solve an optimal multiple - stopping problem .",
    "numerical methods are required to compute the solution . in @xcite",
    ", fukasawa performs an asymptotic analysis for minimizing the product @xmath24 ( an extension to jump processes has been recently done in @xcite ) . under regularity and integrability assumptions ( and for a convex payoff on a single asset ) , fukasawa derives an asymptotic lower bound and provides an optimal strategy .",
    "his contribution is the closest to our current work .",
    "but there are major differences :    we focus on results , which is probably more meaningful for hedging issues .",
    "we are not aware of similar works in this direction .",
    "we allow a quite general model for the asset .",
    "it can be a multidimensional diffusion process ( local volatility model ) ; see the discussion in section  [ subsection : au ] . as a comparison , in @xcite",
    "the analysis is carried out for a one - dimensional model ( mainly black  scholes model ) .",
    "we also allow a great generality on the payoff .",
    "in particular , the payoff can be discontinuous , and the option can be exotic ( asian , lookback ,  ) ( see section  [ subsection : au ] for examples ) : for mathematical reasons , this is a major difference in comparison with @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the latter reference , the payoff convexity is needed to ensure the positivity of the option gamma ( second derivative of price ) , which is a crucial property in the analysis .",
    "also , for discontinuous payoff the @xmath11 integrability of the sensitivities ( greeks ) up to maturity may be not satisfied ( see @xcite ) ; thus , some quantities in the analysis ( e.g. , the integral of the second moment of the gamma of digital call option ) may become infinite . in our setting",
    ", we circumvent these issues by only requiring the sensitivities to be finite up to maturity : actually , this property is systematically satisfied by payoffs for which the discontinuity set has a zero - measure ( see section  [ subsection : au ] ) , which includes all the usual situations to our knowledge .",
    "to achieve such a level of generality and an analysis , we design efficient tools to analyze the control and convergence of local martingales , of their increments and so forth .",
    "all these results represent another important theoretical contribution of this work .",
    "other applications of these techniques are in preparation . at",
    "last , although the distribution of hitting time of random ellipsoid of the form ( [ eq : ta : ellip ] ) is not explicit , quite surprisingly we obtain tight estimates on the maximal increments of @xmath25 , which may have applications in other areas ( like stochastic simulation ) .",
    "_ outline of the paper_. in the following , we present some notation and assumptions that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] is aimed at defining our class of stopping time strategies and deriving some general theoretical properties in this class .",
    "for that , we establish new key results about convergence , which fit well our framework .",
    "all these results are not specifically related to financial applications .",
    "the main results about hedging error are stated and proved in section  [ sec3 ] .",
