    "over the past couple of years non - perturbative aspects of compactifications of type iib theory have been studied first in terms of f - theory @xcite compactifications and later in an explicitly stringy form by means of including non - perturbative @xmath1 7-brane configurations in the background .",
    "the former has been particularly important in the analysis of the duality with the heterotic string .",
    "compactifications of f - theory on elliptic calabi - yau two - folds ( @xmath0 ) , three - folds and four - folds have been argued to be dual to certain compactifications of the heterotic string to 8 , 6 and 4 dimensions . the simplest case to consider is the compactifications of f - theory to 8 dimensions on an elliptic @xmath0 .",
    "this theory is believed to be dual to the heterotic string on @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 pattern of gauge symmetry enhancement in the heterotic string @xcite is reproduced in f - theory by the pattern of collapsible holomorphic two spheres in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the location in the moduli space where the symmetries occur are provided by the zeros of the discriminant of the @xmath0 surface .",
    "this establishes the duality at a geometrical level .",
    "the other approach that has emerged @xcite is type iib theory compactified on a sphere in the presence of non - local 7-branes which extend in the uncompactified directions and appear as singular points on the sphere .",
    "the presence of the @xmath3 series of algebras arising on 7-branes configurations were explored in refs@xcite where it was shown how @xmath1-strings and string junctions stretched between the 7-branes correspond to vector bosons of the eight dimensional gauge theory .",
    "other algebras organised in terms of the conjugacy classes of @xmath4 have been identified in terms of the strings and junctions connecting the 7-branes @xcite .",
    "some connections among elements in the type iib theory and their duals in the heterotic theory in 8 dimensions have appeared in the literature@xcite .",
    "however all identifications have been at a qualitative level , in the sense that the masses of the gauge bosons that are supposed to become massless at specific points in the moduli space to generate the relevant gauge group had not been checked explicitly .",
    "we will compute explicitly the masses of the relevant gauge bosons in many examples in this paper .",
    "the masses of bps @xmath1-strings have been computed explicitly in two cases .",
    "the first was the work of sen @xcite who used the results of seiberg - witten for @xmath5 supersymmetric @xmath6 gauge theory with 4 quark flavours .",
    "he computed the masses of bps states in the limit where the 24 7-branes are grouped into four groups of 8 branes yielding an @xmath7 symmetry . in @xcite",
    "sen introduced a new mass formula which showed how the masses above originated from the mass formula of open strings stretched between 7-branes .",
    "later , lerche and stieberger @xcite suggested a generalisation of the formula used by sen in terms of a contribution by the fundamental period of the implicit f - theory @xmath0 .",
    "they argued that this factor would not have any effect in the rigid limit considered by sen but would provide the correct normalisation in the general case .",
    "the masses of the bps gauge fields responsible for the geometrical enhancement of @xmath8 were computed and an exact match with the heterotic string mass formula was obtained . however , only one example and with no wilson lines was considered .    in this paper we use the mass formula of ref@xcite to compute the mass of various gauge bosons potentially responsible for several gauge enhancements in the type iib side .",
    "this takes the description of non perturbative type iib theory to a more quantitative level .",
    "we also compare the masses of the bps gauge bosons in type iib with their heterotic dual partners and find complete agreement .",
    "we analyse examples with both zero and non zero wilson lines .",
    "the explicit map of the geometrical and wilson lines moduli in the heterotic theory to the moduli describing the position of the 7-branes in the sphere is obtained in several examples .",
    "we focus on the branches of moduli space where the massless scalar fields in type iib are constant .",
    "there are three such branches in the moduli space @xcite .",
    "we refer to them as branches 0 , i and ii .",
    "branch 0 exist for any constant value of the scalar fields and allow for only one symmetry group , namely , @xmath7 .",
    "branches i and ii require special values for the scalar fields and allow for a more complex set of gauge symmetries .",
    "the moduli space of these branches have dimensions 1 , 5 , and 8 , respectively .",
    "we will consider , in particular , one - parameter families of curves living in their multidimensional moduli spaces .",
    "once we define a one - parameter family in one of the branches of type iib by choosing a pattern of gauge enhancement we compute the mass of the bps gauge bosons responsible for the symmetries .",
    "the next step is to determine the dual family in the heterotic theory that must have not only the same pattern of gauge enhancements but also the masses of the bps gauge bosons must match everywhere in the moduli space ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "this procedure is carried out for a number of examples and the explicit duality maps between the dual families are obtained .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we review results for the heterotic theory compactified on @xmath2 .",
    "we also obtain an expression for masses of bps states in the presence of general wilson lines that generalises the standard holomorphic expression in terms of the kahler structure , @xmath9 , and complex structure , @xmath10 , of the torus .",
    "this expression will play a fundamental role in establishing the duality map in section 4 . in section 3",
    "we review the basics of type iib compactifications on the sphere in the presence of 7-branes in order to establish our conventions . in section 4",
    "we compute the masses of a number of bps states in the two branches of constant @xmath11 on the type iib side and compare with the masses of the heterotic theory duals obtained in section 2 .",
    "explicit maps between the heterotic and type iib moduli are derived . in section 5",
    "we present our conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we show how to generalise some hypergeometric relations used in the paper . and finally , in appendix b we obtain the explicit relation among certain moduli in the heterotic theory that are required elsewhere in the paper .",
    "consider the heterotic string compactified on a torus , @xmath2 , down to 8 dimensions along directions @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in this section",
    "it will not be necessary to specify which heterotic theory we are working with .",
    "the expression for the left and right moving momenta with wilson lines is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the kk momentum and winding numbers , respectively , along @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we define @xmath17 , @xmath18 is an element of either of the lattices @xmath19 or @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the mass spectrum is given by m_h^2 = + + ( n_l - 1 ) + ( n_r - c_r ) where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the left- , right - moving oscillator numbers , and @xmath24 depending on whether the right - moving fermions are periodic @xmath25 or anti - periodic @xmath26",
    ". we must impose the level matching condition to obtain the physical states + ( n_l - 1)= + ( n_r - c_r ) , bps states are given by the additional requirement that @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "therefore for states that are physical and bps saturated we must have p_l^2 - p_r^2 = ( 1- n_l ) , or /2 q^2 + m_iw^i = 1-n_l .",
    "[ 1](summation convention ) . in this case",
    "we can write for the mass formula m_h^2 & = & p_rig^ijp_rj + & = & ( p_i - ( g_il - b_il))g^ij(p_j - ( g_jk - b_jk ) ) .",
    "1a    the massless states with @xmath28 include the 8-dimensional metric , antisymmetric tensor , dilaton and gauge fields which are the cartan generators of the gauge group .",
    "we also have two scalars in the adjoint of the gauge group which are the wilson lines . in the @xmath29 sector",
    "we have massless gauge fields associated to the roots of the underlying gauge group .",
    "they must satisfy p_r^2&=&0 + p_l^2&= & /2 q^2 + m_iw^i = 1 . [ 2 ]    the zero winding numbers sector gives the roots of the subgroup of @xmath30 or @xmath31 which is left unbroken by the wilson lines .",
    "further gauge fields will appear in the non - zero winding numbers sector for special values of the geometrical moduli of the torus , ie , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we discuss these cases in more detail in later sections .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to use the duality between the heterotic strings on @xmath2 and type iib compactified on the base space of a elliptic fibred @xmath0 . when comparing heterotic string states with the dual states in type iib it turns out to be extremely convenient to rewrite the heterotic mass formula in a holomorphic or anti - holomorphic form .",
    "to do so we introduce the parameters u = u_1 + iu_2 & = & + i + [ 2 mm ] [ 3 ] t^0=t^0_1+it^0_2 & = & + i [ 4 ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the kahler structure and @xmath10 the complex structure of the torus .",
    "when dealing with wilson lines it becomes very convenient to introduce a modified version of the kahler structure . in the presence of wilson lines",
    "we redefine orbifolds @xcite .",
    "however , only for the case of very specific wilson lines . ]",
    "u & = & u^0 [ 4a ] + t & = & ( - + ) + i ( 1 + ) [ 5 ] + z & = & /2 ( - ) - i [ 6 ] + n_i & = & m_i - * a_i * . [ 7 ]",
    "note that @xmath37 and @xmath38 as we turn off the wilson lines .",
    "the mass formula , eq([1a ] ) , becomes , in terms of the new variables , m_bps=|n_8 - u n_9 + t w^9 + ( tu + z)w^8| [ 8 ] note that this expression for the mass of bps states is valid for any wilson line .",
    "this mass formula turns out to be a very useful way of rewriting the standard expression , eq([1a ] ) , for compactifications of the heterotic string on @xmath2 , particularly when there are wilson lines",
    ". it will play a major role in what follows .",
    "let us consider type iib theory compactified on a two - sphere , @xmath40 , in the presence of 24 parallel 7-branes which appear as points on @xmath40 .",
    "we refer to this punctured sphere as , @xmath39 .",
    "the theory possesses different strings labelled @xmath1 according to how it is charged with respect to the @xmath41 and @xmath42 antisymmetric fields .",
    "the 7-branes of the theory are also labelled @xmath1 , according to what @xmath1-string can end on it .    in this convention",
    "the elementary string is @xmath43 and a d - string is @xmath44 .",
    "each of the 24 7-branes has an associated branch cut depending on its type .",
    "we follow the conventions of @xcite .",
    "we use three basic types of branes , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , whose corresponding @xmath1 labels are @xmath43 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . across the corresponding cuts the labels",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath10 change according to the monodromy matrices = & ( 1,0 ) : k_a = & t^-1 = , + * b*= & ( 1,-1 ) : k_b = & s t^2 = , + * c*= & ( 1,1 ) : k_c = & t^2s = , where @xmath50 is the matrix s = .",

    "9 for more general backgrounds there has been a suggestion @xcite that this mass formula should be generalised in order to include additional f - theory data .",
    "specifically , the authors of ref@xcite suggested that the mass formula should include the fundamental period of @xmath0 , @xmath52 , so that the mass formula becomes    m_bps^iib= _ z_i^z_j",
