    "since the pioneering work by hosotani @xcite , gauge symmetry breaking through the wilson lines ( hosotani mechanism ) has been an attractive mechanism in physics with extra dimensions .",
    "namely , the mechanism is expected to play the crucial role for the idea of the gauge - higgs unification @xcite-@xcite and can provide a new framework for the grand unified theory .",
    "if extra dimensions are compactified on a certain topological manifold , component gauge fields , which in fact behave like the adjoint higgs scalars at low energies , can develop vacuum expectation values to induce dynamical gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "gauge symmetry breaking patterns have been studied extensively from various points of view in many models , including supersymmetric gauge models @xcite .",
    "gauge symmetry breaking is usually studied by evaluating effective potential perturbatively for the wilson line phases , which are related with the eigenvalues of the component gauge field for the compactified direction .",
    "one introduces the supersymmetric yang - mills theory in five dimensions when one studies the scenario of the gauge - higgs unification . in five dimensions the vector multiplet consists of the gauge field @xmath11 , a real scalar @xmath12 and a dirac spinor @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the dirac spinor is decomposed into two symplectic majorana spinors , @xmath14 .",
    "let us note that one needs the real scalar @xmath15 in order to match the on - shell degrees of freedom between the bosons and fermions in the supermultiplet .",
    "if one of the space coordinates is compactified on @xmath2 , the component gauge field for the @xmath2 direction @xmath16 becomes a dynamical variable and its vacuum expectation values @xmath17 can not be gauged away , reflecting the topology of @xmath2 .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath17 , the gauge symmetry is dynamically broken down @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that , in addition to @xmath17 , the vacuum expectation values of @xmath15 , which is the adjoint scalar field , are also order parameters for gauge symmetry breaking . even if one tries to remove @xmath17 by a singular gauge transformation , such a gauge transformation changes boundary conditions of fields for the @xmath2 direction .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to remove both of the vacuum expectation values from the theory .",
    "taking @xmath18 into account , though important , has been overlooked in many papers studying the gauge - higgs unification scenario in five dimensional supersymmetric gauge models . from the beginning",
    "is justified , _ a posteriori _ , in some case .",
    "] there are two kinds of order parameter for gauge symmetry breaking in the theory , one is @xmath17 , which has a periodicity of @xmath19 , reflecting the original five dimensional local gauge invariance and the other one is @xmath18 . in order to study the vacuum structure by evaluating the effective potential",
    ", one should take both @xmath17 and @xmath18 into account .",
    "in this paper we study the one - loop effective potential for the five - dimensional yang - mills theory defined on @xmath1 by taking both @xmath17 and @xmath18 into account . to our best knowledge , this is the first paper that studies the effective potential by taking account of the two kinds of order parameter for gauge symmetry breaking . we will give the expression for the potential in one - loop approximation .",
    "we study the case of the @xmath20 gauge group and determine the vacuum expectation values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 dynamically .",
    "we also evaluate masses for @xmath16 and @xmath15 for the @xmath3 gauge group , which are generated by quantum effects .",
    "we numerically obtain the masses with respect to the change of the supersymmetry breaking parameters .",

    "we assume that all the fields satisfy the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we evaluate the effective potential in one - loop approximation by expanding fields around the vacuum expectation values @xmath29 and by keeping the quadratic terms with respect to the fluctuations .",
    "as noted in the introduction , one needs to take both @xmath17 and @xmath18 into account .",
    "it is convenient to choose the gauge fixing term as @xmath30\\biggr ) \\biggr)^2 , \\label{fixing}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the gauge parameter and @xmath32.\\ ] ] the thooft - feynman gauge @xmath33 makes the expression simple , as shown in the appendix , where the detailed expressions for the quadratic terms are given .",
    "there arises the tree - level potential ( [ tree ] ) , which is given by the commutator between @xmath16 and @xmath15 . by utilizing the global gauge degrees of freedom , @xmath17 , for example , can be diagonalized .",
    "it is natural to expect that the vacuum configuration is given by the one satisfying the flat direction , @xmath34=0.\\ ] ] this means that both @xmath17 and @xmath18 take diagonal forms simultaneously .",
    "thus , we parameterize them as is a dimensionless quantity . ]",
    "it is important to note that one can redefine the field in such a way that @xmath17 is removed by a singular gauge transformation , but , accordingly , the boundary condition of field is twisted by an amount of the vacuum expectation values .",
    "thus , one can not remove both @xmath36 s and @xmath37 s from the theory , so that we have two kinds of the order parameters for the gauge symmetry breaking , and @xmath36 s are related with the wilson line phase @xmath38 and are modules of @xmath19 .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath16 is a part of the five dimensional gauge potential @xmath39 and is subject to the five dimensional local gauge transformation . on the other hand , the vacuum expectation values for @xmath15 does not have such the periodicity , and",
    "@xmath15 is just a real scalar field belonging to the adjoint representation under the gauge group .    inserting the vacuum expectation values ( [ vevuno ] ) and ( [ vevdue ] ) into eqs.([gauge])@xmath40([dirac ] ) in the appendix",
    ", we arrive at eqs.([vevsigma])@xmath40([vevdirac ] ) .",

    "here we have made the wick rotation for the four - dimensional momentum .",
    "we immediately observe that the effective potential @xmath48 vanishes due to supersymmetry , @xmath49 in order to have nonvanishing effective potential , one needs to break supersymmetry somehow .",
    "one of the simple ways to break supersymmetry is to resort to the scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite . in the mechanism",
    "the boundary conditions of the gauge fermions for the @xmath2 direction are twisted , @xmath50 the nontrivial phase @xmath51 shifts the kaluza - klein modes and modifies the momentum for the @xmath2 direction as @xmath52 moreover , it is also possible to break supersymmetry by introducing the gauge invariant bare mass term @xmath53 for @xmath23 @xcite . in this case , we have the modification given by @xmath54 supersymmetry is explicitly broken for both cases .    following the standard prescription @xcite",

    "it is enough to consider the region of @xmath73 .",
    "we also note here that the effective potential ( [ effpot ] ) shares many similarities with the potential obtained in finite temperature field theory .",
    "the particles in the theory become massive due to @xmath18 ( and @xmath70 ) , so that , as is well known , particles with smaller wavelengths than the inverse temperature @xmath74 have the boltzmann ( exponentially ) suppressed distribution in the system .",

    "the mass scale should be the one at which both breaking are occurred .",
    "in fact , as observed in eq.([higgsmass ] ) the mass scale of @xmath109 is the order of the scale at which the breaking is realized .    as the bare mass @xmath70 becomes larger and larger , the contribution from the fermion @xmath23 to the effective potential is suppressed more and more thanks to the boltzmann factor in eq.([suppress ] ) , and what is left is the contribution from the boson alone .",

    "the values of @xmath51 affects to the size of the mass for @xmath117 .",
    "as shown in table @xmath47 , we see that @xmath118 , which corresponds to the antiperiodic boundary condition for the fermions and is the `` maximal '' breaking of supersymmetry , significantly enhances the masses .",

    "this can be understood from the similarity of the potential with the one obtained in finite temperature field theory as explained in the text .",
    "we have first studied the effective potential for the @xmath20 gauge group , and , by minimizing the potential , we have obtained the vacuum configuration ( [ vacuum ] ) , for which the gauge symmetry is not broken .",

    "<S> we correctly take the vacuum expectation values into account in addition to the wilson line phases to give an expression for the effective potential , and gauge symmetry breaking is discussed . in evaluating the potential </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the scherk - schwarz mechanism and introduce bare mass for gaugino in order to break supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain masses for the scalars , the adjoint scalar , and the component gauge field for the @xmath2 direction in case of the @xmath3 gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that large supersymmetry breaking gives larger mass for the scalar . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is easily applied to the @xmath4 case .    </S>",
