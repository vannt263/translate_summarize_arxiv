    "fluctuations of the positions of nucleons within nuclei result in event - by - event fluctuations of the density of matter produced in ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",

    "they may generate elliptic flow even in high - multiplicity proton - proton collisions at the lhc  @xcite , which might be responsible  @xcite for the near - side ridge observed by cms  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fluctuations result in new , odd harmonics of the azimuthal distribution of outgoing particles , which are clearly seen experimentally through two - particle correlations  @xcite : the third harmonic , triangular flow  @xcite , is largely responsible for the ridge and away - side structure seen in two - particle correlations and has recently been analyzed at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite . a smaller first harmonic ,",
    "directed flow  @xcite , is also predicted . finally , there are non - trivial correlations between these three harmonics  @xcite , and they can be directly measured experimentally  @xcite .",

    "these complex monte - carlo approaches do not allow for a simple understanding of the key quantities driving flow fluctuations .    in this paper",

    "a standard choice for @xmath4 is a gaussian profile  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 controls the width .",

    "we now compare analytic results derived from our independent - source model with results obtained using the mckt - v1.00 monte - carlo  @xcite . with this monte - carlo",
    "one can calculate results from both a color - glass - condensate ( cgc ) inspired model  the mc - kln  @xcite improved with running - coupling bk unintegrated gluon densities  @xcite , as well as a standard monte - carlo glauber  @xcite .",
    "we present only results for pb - pb collisions at 2.76  tev per nucleon - nucleon collision , though results for 200  gev au - au collisions agree equally well . in the glauber model , each participant nucleon is given a weight  @xcite @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the number of binary collisions of that nucleon , and @xmath80  @xcite .",
