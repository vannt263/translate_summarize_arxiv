    "the discovery of the spin - peierls ( sp ) transition in the inorganic material cugeo@xmath4 @xcite has led to an intense investigation of the magnetic properties of this system .",

    "x - ray scattering studies of the incommensurate phase of cugeo@xmath4 show the existence of a soliton lattice with the width of the soliton being much larger than that predicted by calculations @xcite . these results , taken together , call for a better understanding of the homogeneous state of cugeo@xmath4 above @xmath5 which should eventually shed light on the nature of the sp transition itself .",

    "the susceptibility of cugeo@xmath4 above @xmath5 @xcite shows a broad maximum as expected for heisenberg chains . from the temperature",
    "at which this maximum is observed ( 56 k ) , one can estimate the value of @xmath11 using the results of bonner and fisher @xcite , yielding @xmath11 = 88 k. this discrepancy between the value of @xmath11 estimated from static susceptibility measurements and ins led to the proposal @xcite , @xcite that a minimal model to describe the magnetic properties of this system above @xmath5 is the so - called `` @xmath0 - @xmath1 '' model .",

    "it is then easy to see that the hamiltonian ( [ mfham ] ) reduces to @xmath49 on evaluating the mean field quantities and substituting them in the definitions for @xmath50 and @xmath51 we get two mean field equations that have to be solved for self consistency : @xmath52            - { \\alpha j \\over",

    "as pointed out in @xcite , the spinon velocity obtained from the mean field theory of antiferromagnetic domain walls , namely @xmath60 is quite close to the exact value ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "when @xmath14 is nonzero , our result shows that the spinon velocity is reduced because of frustration arising from the n.n.n . interaction",
    "this is to be expected from physical grounds .",
    "on comparing the spinon velocity in ( [ disp ] ) with the spinon velocity for @xmath16 , we see that the effect of the n.n.n .",
    "term is to reduce the spinon velocity as @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "the ground state energy at @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the ground state energy of the n.n .",
    "heisenberg chain within this approach , which compares well with the exact result @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the mean field solution described above provides a simple way to calculate physical quantities in the @xmath0 - @xmath1 model .",
    "in particular , one can see how the presence of the n.n.n .",
    "term in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) alters the susceptibility at finite temperatures .",
    "before we proceed to show this , we discuss the limitations of the mean field theory .",
    "first , we point out that though the mean field _",
    "solution _ is valid for any value of @xmath14 , the theory itself is meaningful only in the gapless regime , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath20 where the spinons are deconfined .",
    "this mean field theory is not suited for studying the transition between the gapless and gapped phases of the @xmath0 - @xmath1 model .",
    "we reemphasize that our objective is not to undertake such a study ( indeed , far more powerful techniques are available and have been used to study this problem ) but to provide a simple self consistent prescription to calculate physical quantities in the gapless phase of the @xmath0 - @xmath1 model .",
    "next , we point out that the mean field solution is plagued by its reluctance to move away from the universality class of the @xmath67 model .",
    "this can be seen by writing down the ( mean field ) ground state wave function in terms of the soliton operators @xmath68 as @xmath69 .",
    "whereas in the @xmath67 model , the hamiltonian can be solved exactly to determine @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the mean field solution of the heisenberg as well as the @xmath0  -  @xmath1 model give the same @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "in this sense , this theory has the same difficulties as the mean field theory of bulaevski @xcite though the nature of the quasiparticles in the two theories are entirely different .",
    "finally , let us consider the reduction in the spinon velocity as a function of the n.n.n .",
    "coupling @xmath14 . from ( [ disp ] )",
    ", we see that the velocity @xmath72 .",
    "this result can be checked numerically . in a recent numerical study , fledderjohann and",
    "gros @xcite found that the spinon velocity in the @xmath0 - @xmath1 model can be fit to the relation @xmath73 .",
    "thus we see that the results from mean field theory _ underestimate _ the effects of frustration .",
    "we are now ready to consider the static susceptibility at finite temperatures .",
    "in particular , we are interested in seeing how the presence of a n.n.n .",
    "interaction alters the susceptibility of an antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain .",
    "now , it is well known that the susceptibility of the heisenberg chain is constant at zero temperature and increases to a broad maximum at @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the increase in susceptibility is due to the gapless spinon excitations . as we shall see , the n.n.n .",
    "term causes a suppression in the maximum value of this susceptibility .",
    "the reason for this is that the spinon velocity now has a different temperature dependence with a nonzero @xmath14 . to illustrate this , we show in fig .",
    "[ vel ] , the spinon velocity as a function of temperature .",
    "the long - dashed line shows the results for the case @xmath16 .",
    "the solid line shows the spinon velocity as a function of temperature for @xmath75 . for the latter case",
    ", we have , for purposes of illustration , chosen @xmath23 such that the velocity at @xmath76 , given by ( [ disp ] ) is the same as that for @xmath16 .",
    "it should be noted that while the low temperature velocities for different @xmath14 are identical , the results begin to differ as temperature increases .",
    "in particular , they are perceptibly different at @xmath77 . therefore , we should expect a difference in the finite temperature susceptibilities as a function of @xmath14 at these temperatures .",
    "we have calculated the static susceptibility at finite temperatures from the mean field solution . at this point , it is crucial to realize that the results from the mean field theory violate spin - rotational invariance of the underlying hamiltonian , and that the physically relevant susceptibility would be given by the average @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the susceptibilities for the applied magnetic fields in @xmath80 and @xmath81 directions respectively .",
    "next we note that our mean field theory becomes exact for the @xmath67 model for which the susceptibilities @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite , in dimensionless units and at zero temperature .",
    "we therefore have for the @xmath67 model , the relation @xmath84 we have applied this relation to our mean - field solution of the heisenberg model .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the susceptibility at zero temperature is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath87 is the electron bohr magneton and @xmath88 , as before , is the spinon velocity .",
    "the factor @xmath89 in the denominator comes from the average over the directions of the applied magnetic field as given by eq .",
    "( [ factor_2 ] ) .    as a quick check of our results ,",
    "let us consider the case @xmath16 and compare with the results of bonner and fisher @xcite .",
    "at @xmath76 , from ( [ disp ] ) and the above expression for susceptibility , we get @xmath90 , which compares very well with the bethe - ansatz results @xmath91 @xcite . at finite temperatures",
    ", we solved the mean field equations ( [ mfeqn ] ) numerically and used it to determine the susceptibility .",
    "we found that the temperature at which the susceptibility attains its maximum value is given by @xmath92 , while the corresponding value quoted in @xcite is 0.641 .",
    "these comparisons encourage us to proceed to the case @xmath93 .",
    "our results for the case @xmath93 are summarized in fig .",
    "[ susc_1d ] where they are compared with experimentally obtained values from a polycrystalline sample of cugeo@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we have chosen @xmath94 in all our calculations .",
    "the long - dashed line shows the results for @xmath95 k , @xmath16 that are clearly in disagreement with experiment .",
    "the choice of @xmath96 k @xcite stems from the observed temperature ( 56 k ) at which the susceptibility attains its maximal value and its relation to j from the results of @xcite or equivalently , our results .",
    "the dotted line shows the results we obtained from choosing @xmath97 k , @xmath98 .",
    "this choice of @xmath23 yields the observed value of spinon velocity from ins @xcite without including the effects of frustration .",
    "it is clear that there still remains a discrepancy between the observed and calculated values at intermediate temperatures .",
    "our results for the susceptibility with a non vanishing @xmath14 are given by the solid line .",
    "here , we have chosen @xmath99 k and @xmath100 .",
    "this choice of parameters when substituted in ( [ disp ] ) gives the value of the spinon velocity observed in ins .",

    "[ vel ] and our discussion of those results ) .",
    "however we see that at as temperature increases , a non vanishing @xmath14 does tend to suppress the susceptibility .",
    "we see that there is still a discrepancy between theory and experiment which is of the order of 10% .",
    "we believe this discrepancy is because the mean field theory underestimates the effects of frustration .",
    "we also considered the possibility that the discrepancy between theory and experiment may well be due to the effect of interchain coupling .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the interchain superexchange @xmath102 and this could play an important role .",
    "a qualitative argument against this possibility is that at temperatures where the discrepancy is maximal ( @xmath103 ) , the magnetic correlation lengths should be small . to substantiate this argument , we did a simple calculation using renormalized spin wave theory with the appropriate values of @xmath104 and @xmath11 . were it to order antiferromagnetically , the observed values of the superexchange interactions suggest that the  nel temperature \" of cugeo@xmath4 would be @xmath105 k which is lower than @xmath5 . at temperatures above @xmath5 ,",
    "the effect of ( short range ) antiferromagnetic ordering can be easily estimated by spin wave theory . a standard calculation using the `` decoupling approximation '' @xcite",
    "gives us the susceptibility @xmath106 in terms of the integral equation @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we have ignored @xmath110 and set @xmath111 to be unity for convenience .",
    "one integration in the l.h.s . of the above expression can be done trivially and we obtain @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 . solving the above equation numerically with @xmath97 k , we obtain the susceptibility as shown in fig .",
    "[ susc_2d ] .",
    "it should be remembered that the theoretical results are valid only at temperatures well above @xmath5 where the effects of phonons as well as effects due to competing antiferromagnetic and sp instabilities can be ignored .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ susc_1d ] and fig .",
    "[ susc_2d ] show that a one dimensional model with frustration is indeed a better starting point to study cugeo@xmath4 rather than an anisotropic two dimensional model .",
    "this is in agreement with a number of experimental observations such as ( i ) a non - zero nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate seen in a cu nqr study @xcite , ( ii ) the two - spinon continuum observed in ins above @xmath5 @xcite , and ( iii ) a broad continuum of magnetic excitations seen in two - magnon raman scattering above @xmath5 @xcite , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "all these experiments show characteristic features of a one dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "since our mean field solution underestimates the effects of frustration , we are unable to determine the exact ratio of @xmath3 in cugeo@xmath4 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the value of @xmath3 was estimated to be 0.36 @xcite and 0.24 @xcite by two independent studies . since these two values lead to two different fixed points ( gapped and ungapped spin excitation spectra respectively ) , careful experimental investigation of spin dynamics above @xmath5 may provide further clues .",

    "this feature may be detected experimentally . as a possibility ,",
    "we suggest ins experiments in the presence of a magnetic field . in the presence of a magnetic field , it is known that the spinon dispersion @xmath117 goes to zero at @xmath118 given by @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "this is a feature of low dimensional spin excitations and is seen in the @xmath67 model as well .",
    "this behavior should be contrasted with spin wave ( magnon ) excitations , where no such node appears in the magnon dispersion as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "an examination of the temperature dependence of this node with moderately high fields @xmath120 should indicate the presence of frustration as shown in fig .  [ vel ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the raman spectra in the homogeneous phase of cugeo@xmath4 observed in two - magnon scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "a partial account of the results in this section has been published elsewhere @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we first give a brief summary of the pertinent experimental results .",
    "scattering of light from magnetic ( as opposed to phonon ) excitations in cugeo@xmath4 is strongest in the @xmath121 geometry _ viz .",
    "_ , when both incident and scattered light are polarized along the crystallographic  direction .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that exchange interactions are strongest along this direction .",
    "the raman spectra above @xmath5 are rather featureless and the spectral weight is distributed over a wide range of energies ( 100 - 300 @xmath122 ) . a broad maximum",
    "is observed around 250 @xmath122 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the raman spectra observed in antiferromagnetically ordered compounds such as the rutile or perovskite halides . in these compounds , one typically observes a well defined peak at characteristic magnon energies which is broadened by magnon - magnon interactions @xcite .",
    "this comparison immediately suggests light scattering in cugeo@xmath123 from a continuum of excitations rather than single - particle excitations ( magnons ) .    the magnetic raman scattering in cugeo@xmath4 can be studied using the scheme of fleury and loudon @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that in an exchange - coupled system , an incident photon can create particle - hole excitations accompanied by a pair of spin flips that propagate as magnons . in this scheme",
    "the raman operator @xmath124 has essentially the same form as the heisenberg exchange interaction , i.e. @xmath125 .",
    "in one dimensional chains with n.n .",
    "exchange interaction , we are faced with an intriguing situation where the raman operator for scattering in the @xmath121 geometry is proportional to the hamiltonian itself . thus , there should be no raman scattering from a n.n .",
    "heisenberg spin chain , a fact which has not been appreciated previously @xcite . however , there are two ways in which raman scattering can occur : ( i ) interchain couplings and ( ii ) exchange interactions that are extended in space , i.e. n.n.n . interactions .",
    "let us first consider the former possibility .",
    "the role of the interchain couplings is to establish short range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "in such a case , incident light is scattered off paramagnon excitations .",
    "however as we mentioned earlier , the featureless spectra observed in cugeo@xmath4 seem to indicate scattering from a continuum of excitations .",
    "this is basically a one - dimensional feature .",
    "the second possibility is therefore a more viable explanation of the experimental results . in view of the results discussed in the previous section ,",
    "it is also a more natural choice .",
    "thus , we work with a hamiltonian which has both n.n . and",
    "n.n.n . interactions .",
    "this implies that the raman operator will also have both n.n . and n.n.n",
    ". terms . for convenience ,",
    "we subtract from the raman operator , a part which commutes with the basic hamiltonian of cugeo@xmath4 ( [ ham ] ) , we can write down a raman operator of the form @xmath126 the raman intensity is then evaluated by considering the appropriate spectral function .",
    "we now use the mean field theory described in the previous section to compute the raman intensity .",
    "the raman operator @xmath127 can be written in terms of the soliton operators and transformed into quasiparticle or spinon operators just as we did in the previous section .",
    "we find that there are three basic physical processes caused by @xmath127 : ( i ) spinon - spinon scattering , ( ii ) two - spinon creation / annihilation and ( iii ) four - spinon creation / annihilation . of these , ( ii ) corresponds to one - magnon excitations . on using the mean field solution",
    ", one can show that the contribution to light scattering from these excitations vanishes , which is just the statement that one - magnon excitations with @xmath128 have zero spectral weight .",
    "two - magnon scattering is given by ( iii ) .",
    "we find that the matrix element for two - magnon ( four - spinon ) creation ( stokes component of the scattering intensity ) is given by @xmath129~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation is over the range of spinon momenta and the quantities @xmath70 and @xmath71 are as defined in the previous section .",
    "the matrix element can be understood as arising from a decomposition of two magnon excitations into four spinon excitations with total momentum zero .",
    "given this matrix element , we can calculate the raman intensity .",
    "the mean field solution thus provides a way of incorporating matrix element effects arising from the raman operator instead of postulating _ ad hoc _ filtering functions that mimic matrix element effects . as noted elsewhere",
    "@xcite , such effects could be very important and ignoring them often leads to erroneous conclusions .    the results for the raman intensity at @xmath130 k with @xmath99 k and @xmath100 are shown in fig .",

    "interactions are negligible . in such materials , while ins can observe the _",
    "one - magnon _ continuum , the _ two - magnon _ continuum can not be observed in raman scattering .",
    "these conclusions are indeed borne out by experiments @xcite .",
    "to summarize the results of this study , we have proposed a mean field solution to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with n.n . and",

    "we then used the mean - field theory to evaluate the static susceptibility @xmath106 .",
    "a comparison with experimental results shows that the inclusion of frustration does reproduce the suppression of susceptibility at finite temperatures seen experimentally .",
    "we have been able to identify the physical reason for the suppression of @xmath106 as a function of @xmath14 with the differing behavior of the respective @xmath2 .",
    "we have also presented the results of a spin wave calculation for an anisotropic two dimensional heisenberg model which do not , on the other hand , compare well with the experimental results for the susceptibility .",
    "this suggests that a one dimensional model with frustration is a more appropriate starting point to model the homogeneous phase of cugeo@xmath4 .",
    "we also used the mean field solution to calculate the two - magnon raman intensity from a one dimensional antiferromagnetic chain and showed that frustration is necessary for obtaining a non - vanishing spectral weight .",
    "considering the fact that n.n.n .",
    "interactions are needed to produce a good fit to the static susceptibility of cugeo@xmath4 , using the same idea to explain the raman continuum provides a consistent picture as far as modeling goes . quite apart from the relevance to cugeo@xmath4 ,",
    "this method of computing raman intensity can be used to study experimental results now available in sr@xmath136cuo@xmath4 and srcuo@xmath136 @xcite . clearly , a complete understanding of cugeo@xmath4 calls for the inclusion of interchain and phonon effects . the mean field solution presented in this paper",
