    "we study the ratio of the unintegrated gluon distribution of a nucleus @xmath3 over the unintegrated gluon distribution of a proton @xmath4 scaled up by @xmath1 @xmath5 this ratio is a measure of the number of particles produced in a proton - nucleus collision versus the number of particles in proton - proton collisions times the number of collisions . the transverse momentum of gluons is denoted by @xmath6 and the rapidity variable by @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 has been widely studied  @xcite in the framework of the bk - equation  @xcite which describes the small-@xmath8 physics in the _ mean field approximation_. using the bk - equation one finds in the geometric scaling regime ( transition from high to low gluon density , see fig.[had_wf ] ) in the fixed coupling case that the shape of the unintegrated gluon distribution of the nucleus and proton as a function of @xmath6 is preserved with increasing @xmath9 , see fig.[gs](a ) , because of the geometric scaling behaviour @xmath10 , and therefore the leading contribution to the ratio @xmath0 is basically @xmath6 and @xmath9 independent , scaling with the atomic number @xmath11 as  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "this means that gluons inside the nucleus and proton are somewhat shadowed since @xmath14 lies between total ( @xmath15 ) and zero ( @xmath16 ) gluon shadowing .",
    "the _ partial gluon shadowing _ comes from the anomalous behaviour of the unintegrated gluon distributions which stems from the bfkl evolution .",
    "the partial gluon shadowing may explain why particle production in heavy ion collisions scales , roughly , like @xmath17  @xcite .    over the last few years",
    ", it has been understood how to deal with small-@xmath8 physics at high energy _ beyond the mean field approximation _ ,",
    "i.e. , beyond the bk  @xcite and jimwlk  @xcite equations .",
    "we have learned how to account for the elements missed in the mean field evolution , such as the descreteness and fluctuations of gluon numbers  @xcite or the pomeron loops  @xcite .",
    "the main result as a consequence of the above is the emerging of a new scaling behaviour for the dipole - hadron / nucleus scattering amplitude at high rapidities  @xcite , the so - called diffusive scaling .",
    "this is different from the geometric scaling behaviour which is the hallmark of the `` mean - field '' evolution equations ( jimwlk and bk equations ) .",
    "the effects of fluctuations on the scattering amplitude  @xcite , the diffractive scattering processes@xcite and forward gluon production in hadronic scattering processes  @xcite has been studied so far . in this work we show how the behaviour of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath9 in the fixed coupling case is completely changed due the effects of gluon number fluctuations or pomeron loops at high rapidity  @xcite .",
    "according to the statistical physics / high energy qcd correspondence  @xcite the influence of fluctuations on the unintegrated gluon distribution of a nucleus / proton is as follows : starting with an intial gluon distribution of the nucleus / proton at zero rapidity , the stochastic evolution generates an ensamble of distributions at rapidity @xmath9 , where the individual distributions seen by a probe typically have different saturation momenta and correspond to different events in an experiment .",
    "to include gluon number fluctuations one has to average over all individual events , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distribution for a single event with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the probability distribution of the logarithm of the saturation momentum , @xmath22 , which is argued to have a gaussian form  @xcite , @xmath23    \\quad \\mbox{for } \\quad \\rho-\\rho_s \\ll \\gamma_c^2 \\sigma^2 \\ , \\label{proba_gauss}\\ ] ] with the dispersion @xmath24 the main consequence of fluctuations is the replacement of the geometric scaling , @xmath25 , by a new scaling , the diffusive scaling  @xcite , namely , @xmath26 is a function of another scaling variable ( @xmath27 is the average saturatin momentum ) , @xmath28 the diffusive scaling , see fig .",
    "[ had_wf ] , sets in when the dispersion of the different events is large , @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the diffusion coefficient , and is valid in the region @xmath32 .",
    "the diffusive scaling means that the shape of the unintegrated gluon distribution of the nucleus / proton changes with increasing @xmath9 because of the additional @xmath33 dependence as compared with the geometric scaling .",
    "the shape becomes flatter and flatter with increasing rapidity @xmath9 , as shown in fig.[gs](b ) , in contrast to the preserved shape in the geometric scaling regime shown in fig.[gs](a ) .",
    "this flattening will lead to a new phenomenon for @xmath0 as discussed below .    using eq.([av_gd ] ) for the averaging over all events and the result from the bk - equation for the the single event distribution one obtains  @xcite for the ratio @xmath34^{\\frac{\\delta\\rho_s}{\\sigma^2 } } \\label{eq : rpa1}\\ ] ] with the difference between the average saturation lines of the nucleus and the proton @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the average saturation momentum of the nucleus ( proton ) .",
    "the difference @xmath38 is fixed by the inital conditions for the average saturation momenta of the nucleus and proton and is @xmath9-indipendent in the fixed coupling case .",
    "for example , using the known assumption @xmath39 one obtains @xmath40 .      * in the diffusive scaling regime where @xmath41 is close to @xmath42 , the gluon shadowing characterized by @xmath43 increases as the rapidity grows ( at fixed @xmath11 or @xmath44 ) because of @xmath45 . at asymptotic rapidity one obtains _ total gluon shadowing _ , @xmath46 , which means that the unintegrated gluon distribution of the nucleus and that of the proton become the same in the diffusive scaling regime at @xmath47 .",
    "the phenomenon of total gluon shadowing is universal since it does not depend on the initial conditions ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "+ total gluon shadowing is an effect of gluon number fluctuations ( or pomeron loops ) since fluctuations make the unintegrated gluon distributions of the nucleus and of the proton flatter and flatter  @xcite and their ratio closer and closer to @xmath48 ( at fixed @xmath44 ) with rising rapidity , as shown in fig.[gs](b ) .",
    "total gluon shadowing is not possible in the geometric scaling regime in the fixed coupling case since the shapes of the gluon distributions of the nucleus and of the proton remain the same with increasing @xmath9 giving a constant ratio unequal one , as shown in fig.[gs](a ) . in the absence of fluctuations",
    "one can expect only partial gluon shadowing , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rgs ] ) , in the fixed coupling case . * the ratio @xmath0 increases with rising @xmath41 within the diffusive scaling region . since the exponent @xmath49 decreases with rapidity , the slope of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath50 becomes smaller with growing @xmath9 .",
    "the result for @xmath0 in the diffusive scaling regime in eq.([r_ds ] ) is very different from the result obtained in the mean field approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rgs ] ) , where gluon number fluctuations are not included , which is basically @xmath6 and @xmath9-independent .    the qualitative behaviour of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath6 at four different rapidities , @xmath51 , in the diffusive scaling regime and for a fixed coupling",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ r_ds ] . note that @xmath0 is always smaller than one for values of @xmath6 in the diffusive scaling regime .",
    "the above effects of fluctuations on @xmath0 are valid in the fixed coupling case and at very large energy .",
    "it is nt clear yet whether the energy at lhc is high enough for them to become important .",
    "recently , while in ref .",
    "@xcite a possible evidence of gluon number fluctuations in the hera data has been found , in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a toy model , it has been argued that in case of a running coupling fluctuations can be neglected in the range of hera and lhc energies .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for more studies on running coupling plus fluctuation effects .",
    "moreover , the running of the coupling  @xcite may become more important than the effect of gluon number fluctuations  @xcite . in case of a running coupling , the gluon shadowing increases with rising rapidity in the geometric scaling regime  @xcite , as opposed to the ( roughly ) fixed value ( partial shadowing ) in the fixed - coupling case , and would lead to total gluon shadowing  @xcite at very high rapidities even if fluctuations were absent . in case fluctuations",
    "are important at lhc energy , in addition to the theoretically interesting consequences of fluctuations on @xmath0 , the features of @xmath0 worked out here , as the increase of the gluon shadowing and the decrease as a function of the gluon momentum with rising rapidity , may be viewed as signatures for fluctuation effects in the lhc data .",
    "more work remains to be done in order to clarify how important fluctuation or running coupling effects are at given energy , e.g. , at lhc energy .",
    "an extension of this work by the running coupling may help to clarify some of the open questions ."
