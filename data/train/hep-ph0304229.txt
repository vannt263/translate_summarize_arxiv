    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the direct decay amplitudes for @xmath2 and @xmath0 have approximately no weak phases in the wolfenstein parametrization .",

    "note that the @xmath152 entries in the symmetric flavon are completely consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : brk ] ) ; in the effective theory below the first symmetry breaking scale , these entries correspond to fields with differing charges under the intermediate u(1 ) symmetry acquiring order @xmath205 vevs . all the entries are consistent with the dynamical assumption that a given flavon will either get a vev of the same size as a symmetry - breaking scale , or no vev at all .",
    "in addition , we introduce the following additional flavons with nontrivial u(1)@xmath207 charge , indicated by a subscript : @xmath215 complete u(2 ) representation of the matter fields can be assigned different u(1)@xmath207 charges .",
    "we assign a u(1)@xmath207 charge of @xmath216 to the right - handed up - quark superfields of the first two generations and @xmath176 to the right - handed down quark superfield of the third generation .",
    "we then obtain the yukawa textures @xmath217 and the soft scalar masses @xmath218 here , since the first two generation squarks are degenerate , we have explicitly shown the @xmath21 coefficients in the diagonal entries ( the @xmath219 s are different for @xmath220 ) . also ,",
    "while we generally show only the order in @xmath221 of a given yukawa entry , we have displayed some of the order one coefficients in @xmath74 .",
    "this is to illustrate that with a mild , @xmath222 fine tuning between @xmath223 and @xmath224 we can obtain the cabibbo angle from the down quark yukawa matrix while sufficiently suppressing its 21 entry , thus avoiding the flavor changing problems discussed in section ii .",
    "finally it is worth pointing out that the similarity between the down quark and charged lepton mass hierarchies suggests that under the flavor group @xmath225 and @xmath226 or @xmath227 and @xmath228 , where @xmath229 indicates identical flavor charge assignments .",
    "detailed differences in the mass spectrum can be accommodated using the freedom to adjust order one coefficients .",
    "the first ( second ) choice implies large lh ( rh ) 2 - 3 mixing in the charged lepton sector , independent of whether the theory has any grand unified embedding .",
    "the bi - large neutrino mixing that is favored by the current data must therefore partly originate from the neutral lepton sector .",
    "while we do not explicitly investigate this issue here , it is worth pointing out that aranda , carone and meade  @xcite have shown that bi - large neutrino mixing can arise entirely from the neutral lepton sector in non - abelian models with @xmath230+@xmath148 representation structure , as a consequence of the structure of the right - handed neutrino mass matrix and the nonlinearity of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "non - abelian models of the type we discuss here can in principle be generalized along these lines .",
    "we refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .    to conclude this section",
    ", we point out that the models we have constructed can be tested in future collider experiments assuming that these models are relevant for explaining the @xmath231 anomaly .",
    "both models involve significant right - handed down squark mixing , which implies that the gluino mass must be relatively light , in the @xmath232  gev mass range , based on the numerical results in figure  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite . using the off - diagonal squark masses predicted in each of our models ,",
    "we may obtain lower bound estimates on the mass of first two generation squarks , from @xmath233-@xmath234 and @xmath173-@xmath174 mixing constraints .",
    "these are shown in the figure below , assuming a common mass for all squarks of the first two generations .",
    "while there is uncertainty in the order one coefficients in such predictions , we can conclude qualitatively that the discovery of very light squarks of the first two generation would disfavor the models discussed in this section .",
    "we have considered the detailed flavor structure of supersymmetric theories that can give large contributions to @xmath1 transitions .",
    "we have focused on the possibility that such theories may explain the discrepancy between the value of @xmath170 measured in @xmath235 and @xmath236 decays . with relatively few assumptions , we have isolated minimal , preferred textures for the yukawa couplings and the soft supersymmetry - breaking masses . in the case where the cabibbo angle originates in the down quark yukawa matrix , we argued that the need for squark degeneracy among the first two generations suggests an underlying non - abelian flavor symmetry with a @xmath237 representation structure .",
    "however , in a wide class of these models with symmetric @xmath84 and antisymmetric @xmath85 dimensional representations , the required , large 2 - 3 mixing is correlated with cabibbo - like 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 right - handed mixing angles .",
    "this leads generically to unwanted flavor changing effects , given the requirement that some elements of the superparticle spectrum must be light to contribute non - negligibly to the processes of interest .",
    "we argue that non - abelian models of this type may provide a viable solution to the @xmath238 anomaly providing that a mild fine tuning of parameters is allowed .",
    "on the other hand , if the cabibbo angle originates in the up quark yukawa matrix , the same non - abelian ansatz leads to a value for the up quark mass that is too large . barring more complicated non - abelian constructions",
    ", the desired phenomenology seems in this case to be realized more naturally in abelian models that rely on alignment rather than degeneracy to suppress strangeness - changing neutral currents .",
    "we have presented explicit models that reproduce many of the features of the idealized textures that we have discussed .",
    "we showed how the minimal u(2 ) model , which normally does not have any large mixing angles , may be modified with the help of an additional u(1 ) factor to yield textures of the desired form .",
    "in addition , we presented a new type of alignment model with the desired properties that is based on a single u(1 ) factor and a nontrivial extra - dimensional topography for the matter content .",
    "if the @xmath235 anomaly turns out to be real , or if large deviations from sm predictions are seen in other @xmath1 transitions , these models represent relatively minimal realizations of the desired flavor structure of the mssm and provide a framework for investigating the correlation between a variety of flavor changing process in both quark and lepton sectors .",
