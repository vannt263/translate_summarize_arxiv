    "a powerful way to study the physical and chemical conditions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of distant galaxies is to observe chemical species in absorption against a strong continuum background source .",
    "few such lines of sight have been unveiled so far but ( hereafter pks 1830 ) is one of the most remarkable systems allowing this kind of study .",
    "pks 1830  is a radio - loud quasar with a redshift of @xmath0 = 2.507 @xcite , for which millimeter continuum emission images show two compact components , north - east ( ne ) and south - west ( sw ) , separated by @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this double structure represents two images of the background quasar , magnified and distorted by a lensing system at @xmath0 = 0.88582 @xcite .",
    "this lens was at first indirectly detected by the observations of broad  and molecular absorptions at millimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested the lensing system to be an almost face - on spiral galaxy , which was recently confirmed by direct optical and infrared hst images @xcite .",
    "a key species in the physics and chemistry of the ism in galaxies is atomic carbon .",
    "for instance , [ ] 492ghz is one of the major far - infrared ( fir ) fine structure atomic lines via which cooling of the gas occurs @xcite .",
    "moreover , both c and c@xmath11 , which directly follow from c , are essential in radical reaction networks , especially those leading to carbon chains @xcite .",
    "atomic carbon is also crucial for better understanding the structure of photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) . indeed ,",
    "early observations of [ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) revealed more intense emission than originally predicted by the models .",
    "observations and theory now seem to have been reconciled by considering the effects of the clumpy structure of clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "+ several studies have investigated the use of the neutral atomic carbon ( c ) to co abundance ratio ( @xmath12 ) to investigate the physical conditions of the gas .",
    "a number of such analyses make use of uv absorption data , and hence are limited to diffuse clouds in our galaxy . in order to measure @xmath13  and @xmath14  in a dense environment",
    ", many studies have targeted submillimeter emission of these species",
    ". however , the lowest c transition lies at a rather high frequency ( @xmath1 at @xmath10492  ghz ) , and so its detection requires the use of ground - based facilities with sensitive receivers and/or a large collecting area , or the observation of a redshifted source . moreover , in these submillimeter studies , the emission line data are averaged over large areas and suffer from radiative transfer and excitation effects ( with a bias toward the densest regions ) .",
    "the esma ( `` extended '' submillimeter array , @xcite ) is particularly well suited for this kind of observation as it provides the high sensitivity and high spatial resolution required to observe the weak [ ] transition in pks 1830 . in this work ,",
    "we present the first data obtained with the esma , which probe @xmath12  directly for the first time in absorption in the dense molecular regions of an external galaxy .",
    "the esma consists of the sma array of eight 6-m antennas augmented by the nearby single dishes of the jcmt ( 15 m ) and the cso ( 10.4 m ) .",
    "the collecting area of the esma is twice that of the sma alone , providing increased sensitivity , in particular for the longest baselines , which include the jcmt and cso .",
    "moreover , the longest baseline of the esma is increased by 50% compared to the sma alone , which can bring the angular resolution down to below @xmath15 at 230  ghz , as reported here , and to below 02 at 345ghz , which will be the preferred frequency for esma observations .",
    "+ observations of pks 1830   ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) were carried out with the esma for seven hours on 2008 april 14 ( with eight sma antennas in the very - extended configuration , or `` vex '' ) , and for eleven hours on 2008 august 5 with the sma alone , also in vex configuration .",
    "the esma observations targeted the  ( @xmath18p@xmath19p@xmath20 ) transition while the sma provided co , @xmath5co and c@xmath6o ( all @xmath21 ) data .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] summarizes the main observational parameters .",
    "the 45 esma baselines and the 28 sma baselines had lengths ranging from 25 - 782 m ( 22 - 678k@xmath22 ) and 68 - 509 m ( 56 - 419k@xmath22 ) respectively , resulting in a best resolution at 1.1  mm of 055@xmath2022 .",
    "the tracks interleaved 15 to 20-minute observations of pks 1830  with 3 to 5-minute observations of the calibrators .",
    "observations were carried out in single polarization mode with half - wave plates in the beam of the cso and jcmt that automatically rotate to a common polarization as a function of elevation .    in this interim state of esma commissioning",
    ", the jcmt used receiver a3 which , due to a different intermediate frequency , provided a usable bandwidth of about 1.5  ghz , slightly less than the 2  ghz covered by the sma and cso . for both esma and sma tracks ,",
    "the correlator was setup to provide a uniform spectral resolution of 0.8125  mhz per channel across the full 1.5 - 2  ghz bandwith , resulting in 2304 to 3072 channels per baseline and velocity coverages of @xmath101725 and @xmath102450  @xmath23 , for the esma and sma respectively .",
    "weather conditions were poor on the two nights with atmospheric opacity at 225  ghz ranging from 0.15 to 0.25 .",
    "the data were reduced and calibrated using the mir / idl software packagecqi / mircook.html ] , and imaging was carried out with the miriad software package . the sma receiver temperatures ranged from @xmath1045 to 70  k on both nights , with the cso comparable to the high end of this range , and the jcmt a factor of 2.5 times higher .",
    "the if passband phase and amplitude were calibrated with observations of the strong sources 3c273 , 3c454.3 , j1924@xmath3292 , and nrao530 for the esma observations , and 3c273 , 3c279 and 3c454.3 for the sma - only data . self - calibration of the esma phase of pks 1830  was done on the shortest possible timescales using an initial model consisting of a pair of equal point sources separated by @xmath24 at a position angle of @xmath25 .",
    "the amplitude gains for pks 1830  were determined from the self - calibrated amplitudes of j1924@xmath3292 . for the sma - only data ,",
    "phase calibration was performed in a standard way using j1733@xmath3130 to derive time - dependent amplitude gains throughout the night .",
    "the amplitude gains imply average efficiencies of about 0.75 for the sma antennas , 0.70 for the jcmt , and 0.30 for the cso ; the low efficiency of the cso is likely due to a known malfunction of its rotating polarizer . to set the flux scales , standard sma monitoring observations of j1924@xmath3292 ( esma ) and 3c279 ( sma - only ) at 230ghz and 345ghz were used ( uncertainty @xmath26% ) .",
    "the continuum map , obtained with the esma and derived from line - free channels , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] .",
    "this map shows the two lensed images of the distant quasar , separated by 1@xmath27 , consistent with previously reported values .",
    "figure  [ fig : cont ] also shows the [ ] spectra at the peak of the continuum emission of the sw and ne components .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the absorption spectra of [ ] and co ( @xmath28 ) as a function of heliocentric velocity , @xmath29 , observed in the sw source by the esma and sma respectively .",
    "two- and three - component gaussian fits were applied to the [ ] and co spectra respectively and are overplotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "our [ ] velocities and widths agree within the errors with those reported for other molecular species @xcite and these values were used to guide the fits to the blended co components .",
    "the presence of a fourth velocity component at @xmath10 + 20  @xmath23 in the co spectrum is possible , but was not fitted due to its low signal - to - noise ratio and is therefore not investigated further in this work .",
    "the derived parameters are given in columns 2 - 5 of table  [ results tab ] .",
    "the optical depths at velocities @xmath30 were derived using @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the line and continuum fluxes respectively .",
    "this equation implicitly assumes that the covering factor @xmath34  of the absorbing molecular gas across the finite extent of the background continuum source is 1 , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "+ using line data from lamda , the leiden atomic and molecular databasemoldata/ ] , we ran the radiative transfer code radex @xcite for a range of h@xmath35 number densities @xmath36 and kinetic temperatures @xmath37 , and for @xmath38=5.16  k ; we obtain the excitation temperature for each ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , and hence determine ( @xmath36 , @xmath37)@xmath10(@xmath39@xmath40 , @xmath41k ) corresponding to the excitation temperature @xmath42=@xmath43@xmath105.2 - 8  k derived by @xcite and @xcite for molecular diagnostics of the physical conditions of dense cores such as hco@xmath11 .",
    "using these same ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , we in turn obtain @xmath42  for co and c of @xmath106 - 20 and 8 - 25  k. these slightly higher @xmath42  values are consistent with the lower einstein @xmath44-coefficients of co and c compared to hco@xmath11 .",
    "@xmath14  and @xmath13  are then computed from , e.g. , eq .  2 of @xcite , and are given in table  [ results tab ] . the largest @xmath13  is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath45  @xmath46  reported by @xcite , and the co column density we obtain for the @xmath107  @xmath23  component , 0.9@xmath47  @xmath46 , is also in agreement with the estimate given by these authors .",
    "our results yield @xmath12@xmath102.5 for the two components at @xmath48 and @xmath106  @xmath23 , and an upper limit of @xmath100.5 for the third component at @xmath49  @xmath23 .    finally , we derived an upper limit on @xmath14 in the ne component of @xmath50  @xmath46 , assuming a line width of 15  @xmath23   @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the smallest @xmath14 of @xmath51  @xmath46  expected from the range of hco@xmath11 to co column density ratios determined from our data and that of @xcite .",
    "non - detection of the targeted molecules in the ne component could be due to the change in absorption reported by @xcite in this source .",
    "observations of c , c@xmath11 and co can be used to probe the physical conditions of the gas . however , studies of the ( clumpy ) interstellar medium in external galaxies are complicated by several issues : ( i ) the large observing beams which encompass several regions of differing conditions ; ( ii ) the difficulty of performing [ ] observations due to the weakness of the lines and the poorer atmospheric transparency at the high frequencies of the [ ] transitions ( 492 and 809  ghz ) ; and ( iii ) the impossibility to access the [ ] 158-@xmath52 m transition from the ground . the observations presented here",
    "make it possible to tackle the first two points .",
    "indeed , since the lines are detected in absorption and the galaxy responsible for the latter is almost face - on , the line profiles will not be affected much by rotation broadening .",
    "regarding point ( ii ) , it is worthy to note that in fact , no [ ] absorption has yet been detected in a local galaxy at @xmath53 . for pks 1830 ,",
    "the absorbing material is at a redshift of @xmath100.89 , shifting the 492-ghz [ ] line to @xmath10261  ghz where the atmosphere is more transparent and stable .",
    "while absorption data circumvent some of the problems inherent to emission spectra , some limitations unfortunately remain , in particular , our ( lack of ) knowledge of the structure of the absorbing gas .",
    "this translates partly into the estimation of the covering factor @xmath34 , which is one of the major sources of uncertainty ( along with @xmath42 ) in the determination of the column densities . for co(4@xmath33 ) , the largest optical depth is @xmath102 , meaning that the absorption almost reaches the zero intensity , but it is not heavily saturated as indicated by the non - detection of the less abundant @xmath5co .",
    "indeed , @xcite derive @xmath54c/@xmath5c @xmath1027 , so that if co were heavily saturated , the expected optical depth of @xmath5co would be @xmath550.1 , i.e. at the 2-@xmath56 detection limit .",
    "hence , the covering factor of the absorbing material must be close to unity , as noted by previous studies of this source .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of individual clouds with sizes of order @xmath101  pc ( cf .",
    "@xcite , and sizes of typical galactic molecular clouds of up to a few pc ) in front of a background source of projected size @xmath91  pc at the distance of the galaxy , corresponding to the deconvolved core size of @xmath57  mas measured by @xcite for the sw image of pks 1830  at 7  mm with the vlba .    comparing the total h column density derived with different methods",
    "can indicate whether the `` cloud '' is uniform ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for the sw source , there is no strong evidence for clumpiness , since in this case the total h column density derived from x - ray data ( @xmath58  @xmath46 , @xcite ) is comparable to that derived from millimeter co absorption ( @xmath59  @xmath46 , assuming co / h@xmath35@xmath60 ) , or from  absorption ( @xmath61  @xmath46 , assuming a typical c / h@xmath35@xmath62 , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the assumption that the individual velocity components consist of material with homogeneous physical and chemical conditions seems sufficient , which allows us to compare the column density ratios . + our data indicate two types of @xmath12  ( see table 3 for comparisons ) : a low value , @xmath90.5 , representative of dense cores or pdrs ( @xmath63 ) , and a somewhat high value , @xmath102.5 , close to those derived for translucent clouds ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "qualitatively , low @xmath12  are found in environments with low neutral atomic carbon abundances , such as high - uv environments ( where c becomes ionized ) , or high - density environments ( where co formation is efficient ) .",
    "the presence of high density tracers such as hco@xmath11 , hcn and cs supports the latter case of a dense core for the @xmath65  @xmath23  component . on the other hand , high @xmath12",
    "are representative of low - density , low - column density , mild - uv environments where co is photodissociated but atomic carbon is not ionized . for the @xmath66  @xmath23component , the detection of hot nh@xmath67 ( @xmath685  @xmath23 , @xcite ) and large  optical depth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) point toward a low density pdr . since hot nh@xmath67",
    "was not detected at @xmath69  @xmath23 , the high @xmath12here more likely indicates diffuse or translucent conditions .",
    "an absorbing source at @xmath70 with similar diffuse material , albeit a higher @xmath12  of @xmath1010 , was reported by @xcite .",
    "atomic c variations could also be explained by chemical evolution @xcite : since the timescale for conversion of c to co is comparable to the dynamical timescale of a dense core ( @xmath71  yr ) , @xmath12  is expected to be high in the early stage of dense core formation and to decrease with time .",
    "hence , our @xmath12@xmath102.5 could be indicative of a cloud in an intermediate stage of evolution from diffuse to dense gas , where c has not completely converted into co. + in conclusion , the data presented here demonstrate the ability of the esma to provide observers with high angular resolution , high sensitivity observations .",
    "furthermore , they allowed us to investigate the physical and chemical conditions of the material obscuring the sw component of pks 1830 , and determine @xmath12   directly in a dense molecular cloud located at @xmath0=0.886 .",
    "we are very much indebted to ray blundell , gary davis and tom phillips , the directors of the sma , jcmt and cso , for their continued support and without whom the esma would not be .",
