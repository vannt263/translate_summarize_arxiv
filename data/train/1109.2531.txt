    "recent babar data@xcite on the @xmath7 transition form factor correspond to approximately logarithmic @xmath8 raise of the combination @xmath9 in the region of very high momentum transfers 10 to 40 gev@xmath10 , where perturbative qcd approach@xcite predicts nearly constant behavior for this combination .",
    "it was proposed@xcite to explain the babar `` puzzle '' by assuming that the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) is `` flat '' : @xmath11 .",
    "in general , das @xmath12 depend on the normalization scale @xmath13 , tending to the `` asymptotic '' shape @xmath14 in the @xmath15 limit , for any intial pion da .",
    "a standard way@xcite to this result is to expand the initial pion da over the eigenfunctions @xmath16 of the evolution kernel .",
    "each gegenbauer projection then changes as @xmath17^{\\gamma_n /\\beta_0}$ ] when @xmath13 increases .",
    "all anomalous dimensions @xmath18 are positive , except for @xmath19 which is zero , hence only the @xmath20 part survives . for a pion da given by a sum of a few gegenbauer polynomials , this method gives a convenient analytic expression for the da evolution .",
    "however , to get a flat pion da , one should formally take an infinite number of gegenbauer polynomials ( this difficulty was mentioned in a recent paper@xcite ) , and one should take a very large number of terms to get a reasonably precise ( point by point ) result for the evolved da .",
    "in fact , a long time ago , it was established@xcite that , if the initial pion da @xmath21 has a @xmath22^r$ ] form near the end points @xmath23 , with a small @xmath24 , then evolution just increases this power : @xmath25/\\beta_0 \\   .\\ ] ] this result was obtained by incorporating the large-@xmath26 behavior @xmath27 of the anomalous dimensions in qcd , and summation of the leading end - point region terms .",
    "thus , one may expect that the evolved form of the flat pion da should be close to @xmath28^{2 c_f",
    "\\ln [ \\ln ( \\mu/\\lambda ) / \\ln ( \\mu_0/\\lambda)]/\\beta_0}$ ] .",
    "in particular , this statement was repeated in a more recent paper@xcite on the basis of an analysis similar to that of ref .",
    "our goal is to develop a method that allows one to get explicit analytic expressions for the evolution of the flat distribution amplitude in qcd .",
    "as we will see , our results not only confirm the above expectation , but also provide a regular way of calculating corrections to it .",
    "we also apply this new method to obtain the evolution of the da @xmath29 that is antisymmetric with respect to the central point @xmath5 .",
    "such da may correspond to the so - called `` d - term''@xcite in generalized parton distributions .",
