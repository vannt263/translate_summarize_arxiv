    "<S> this is an old problem , which was put at the forefront in the early 1900 s by its possible relevance to the transmission of radio signals . </S>",
    "<S> the seminal works of zenneck@xcite and sommerfeld@xcite unveiled the existence of surface waves running along the earth , which can be considered as a lossy dielectric . </S>",
    "<S> the interest in these works fainted after the realization that radio transmission does not occur via the exponentially damped surface modes , but through reflection at the ionosphere . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , norton subsequently showed that , in the long distance limit , radio waves decay algebraically at the surface@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result triggered a debate on the range of validity of zenneck - sommerfeld and norton waves in the radio regime that has propagated to our days ( see ref.@xcite for more details and an historical account ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , advances in nanofabrication have allowed the scaling down of old radio devices into the optical regime@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> metallic surfaces are specially interesting because they support spps , which are surface em modes strongly confined to the plane . </S>",

    "<S> the derivative of the phase @xmath53 never cancels and the saddle point approximation outlined above can not be directly applied . as the integral of the product of a smooth and rapidly oscillating function is very small , only the parts of the angular spectrum where @xmath26 changes rapidly in the scale of @xmath54 will give a net contribution to the integral . </S>",
