    "we show that the groundstates involve a competition between compressible states with broken translational symmetry and the incompressible rr states .",
    "our results identify a competing `` smectic '' phase , and point out the important role that finite size effects can have in stabilising this state both in numerical studies and in experimental systems .",

    "we have investigated the nature of the bulk groundstates ( _ i.e. _ of systems containing large numbers of vortices@xcite ) using exact diagonalisation studies on a periodic rectangular geometry ( a torus ) of sides @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which contains @xmath23 vortices.@xcite the torus lends itself naturally to the present study : it is commensurate with crystalline order so allows the study of states with broken translational invariance ; the existence of a conserved momentum@xcite reduces the sizes of the matrices in the diagonalisations and permits the identification of translational - symmetry - broken states through the appearance of quasi - degeneracies at wavevectors equal to the reciprocal lattice vectors ( rlvs ) of the crystalline order.@xcite we express the momentum as a dimensionless wavevector @xmath24 using units of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 components , and report only positive @xmath29 [ states at @xmath30 are degenerate by symmetry ] .",

    "this indicates a tendency to the formation of a _ smectic _",

    "although the smectic period is close to the lattice constant of a square lattice , @xmath46 , there is no indication of ordering in a vortex lattice ( there are no quasi - degenerate states at the requisite rlvs ) .",
    "the low - energy excitation spectra above these quasi - degenerate states are consistent with the existence of a smectic groundstate . for @xmath38 , fig .",
    "[ fig : excitation](a ) , the groundstate has four stripes of four particles each .",
    "there exist low - energy `` particle - hole '' excitations in which a particle is moved from one stripe to another ( to give occupations of @xmath47 ) .",
    "these excitations account for the band of states shown as shaded symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : excitation ] ( a ) .",
    "this band is narrow showing that exchange interactions between the stripes are small . for larger systems ( longer stripes )",
    "one expects the energy of this band to fall and exchange interactions to increase , so these particle - hole excitations will contribute increasingly to the groundstate .",
    "it is possible that this will lead to a phase locking of the stripes , causing the formation of a vortex lattice : a set of states at the rlvs of the lattice would then emerge from this band and become quasi - degenerate with the groundstate ; the remaining states would contribute to the phonon mode of the lattice .",
    "the exact diagonalisation studies show that , at least up to @xmath48 , a vortex lattice does not form .",
    "rather , the system shows behaviour expected of a smectic groundstate : the analogous low - energy band [ shaded symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : excitation](b ) ] broadens to give low - energy states at @xmath49 and @xmath50 corresponding to the competing _ re - oriented _ smectic state ( with three stripes of eight particles parallel to the @xmath27-axis ) ; the remaining low - energy states in this band form the expected gapless shear mode of this smectic state .",
    "thus , the exact diagonalisation results up to @xmath48 are consistent with a smectic groundstate at @xmath0.@xcite      evidence for a competing vortex lattice state at @xmath0 can be obtained by choosing an aspect ratio that is commensurate with the triangular vortex lattice ( away from the local minimum in groundstate energy ) .",

    "moreover , since this aspect ratio does not correspond to a local minimum of the energy , there is poor evidence that the groundstate is a triangular vortex lattice .",
    "as we now discuss , finite size corrections may be acting to favour the smectic state as compared to the triangular vortex lattice .",
    "we illustrate the relevance of finite size corrections by making simple mean - field ans \" atze for the triangular vortex lattice and smectic states .",
    "the triangular vortex lattice is the fully condensed state in the 2d lll that minimises the mean interaction energy .",
    "the mean energy of this state on a periodic geometry is = _ a v_0 - v_0 where @xmath54,@xcite and the correction at finite @xmath6 arises from the lack of self - interaction of the particles [ the mean interaction energy is proportional to @xmath55 .    as a simple description of the smectic state",

    "( this state is similar to the tao - thouless state.@xcite ) the smectic state describes a fragmented condensate , with @xmath57 particles in each stripe and with no fixed phase relationship between the stripes .",

    "this is close to the period of the smectic state appearing in numerics , of approximately @xmath62 . at this period",
    "the energy per particle of the smectic state is = _",
    "s v_0 - v_0 [ eq : smecticenergy ] where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the number of vortices associated with each stripe .",
    "the finite - size correction arises from the lack of self - interaction between the @xmath57 particles in each stripe .    since @xmath65 , the smectic state has higher energy than the triangular lattice in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath66 )",
    "this is a consequence of the general result that repulsive interactions disfavour fragmentation of a condensate owing to the loss of exchange interactions.@xcite it is remarkable , however , just how small the energy difference between these states is [ @xmath67 . for a system on a long cylinder with finite circumference ( @xmath68",
    "with @xmath69 fixed ) the smectic state has lower energy than the triangular vortex lattice for @xmath70 .",
    "the stabilisation of the smectic state can be viewed as a form of mott transition : by fixing a definite particle number on each stripe , there is a reduction in hartree energy at the expense of an increase in exchange energy . at @xmath0",
    "these finite size effects cause the trial smectic state to have lower energy than the triangular vortex lattice up to systems of @xmath71 vortices per stripe .",
    "this is far beyond the system sizes that can be studied in exact diagonalisations .",
    "it is also far beyond the maximum number of vortices crossing the clouds in existing experiments@xcite ( on the order of ten ) , showing that finite size effects can play a significant role in determining the groundstates at intermediate filling factors in experimental geometries .    the simple mean - field analysis presented here is not intended to provide quantitative corrections to the exact diagonalisation results .",
    "this analysis neglects quantum fluctuations which reduce the mean energies of the smectic and vortex lattice states even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "nevertheless , there are indications that finite size corrections do play an important role in the energetics of the smectic state in the numerics : the smectic state has a lower energy the shorter is the length of the stripes .",
    "for example , for @xmath72 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : excitation](b ) ] the two high symmetry configurations correspond to configurations with either four short stripes with @xmath73 parallel to the @xmath27-axis , or three long stripes with @xmath74 parallel to the @xmath28-axis ; they have energies [ obtained from the respective ordering wavevectors , @xmath75 and @xmath76 of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , from results on @xmath79 one can obtain an estimate of the energy for short stripes with @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "there is a monotonic increase in the energy of the smectic state as @xmath82 increases .",
    "owing to the small number of system sizes available , it is difficult to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit for either the smectic or vortex lattice state .",
    "however , the sizes of the energy changes of the smectic are comparable to the separation in energy to the triangular vortex lattice , for which estimates of the energy per particle can be as low as @xmath83.@xcite thus , while the smectic state is the groundstate in systems of up to @xmath48 , it is possible that finite size effects are playing a role in stabilising the smectic state .    in the studies of ref . in which a transition to a vortex lattice was seen in systems of @xmath84 vortices , the aspect ratio used was close to the minimum of the groundstate energy .",
    "in view of the above analysis , we can now say that in those studies@xcite the estimate of the critical filling factor @xmath85 arose from a competition between the triangular vortex lattice and the smectic state .",
    "the finite - size corrections to the energy of the state competing with the triangular vortex lattice were not recognised in ref .. from the present analysis , we conclude that the analysis of ref . underestimated the stability of the vortex lattice in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the available numerical results are consistent with the vortex lattice being more stable than the smectic state down to as small a filling factor as @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting phase that competes with the smectic and the triangular vortex lattice is the @xmath1 read - rezayi state.@xcite as discussed above , for contact interactions the groundstate at @xmath0 appears to be compressible on the scale of the systems studied .",
    "however , as for @xmath10,@xcite by introducing interactions with non - zero range , we find that the spectrum becomes characteristic of the incompressible rr state ( showing clear quasi - degeneracies at the expected wavevectors , and a gap to other excitations ) .",
    "the case of dipolar interactions@xcite is of particular experimental relevance , as these can be important for atomic species with large magnetic moments.@xcite fig .",

    "an enhancement of the overlap with the @xmath1 rr state in related calculations on the spherical geometry for a model short - range interaction has also been reported.@xcite",
    "we have shown that exact diagonalisation studies of rotating bose gases with contact interactions indicate that the groundstate at @xmath0 is a quantum smectic state .",
    "we argued that finite size corrections may lead to an enhanced stability of the smectic state in the system sizes amenable to exact diagonalisations , and the triangular vortex lattice may have lower energy in the thermodynamic limit . in the regime of intermediate filling factors , @xmath31 , the correlation length of the groundstate for contact interactions remains larger than the maximum system sizes that are available in exact diagonalisations .",
