    "<S> non - commutative geometries have been proposed as an approach to quantum gravity and have led to the construction of non - commutative black holes , whose interior singularities are purportedly eliminated due to quantum effects . here </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence that these black holes are in fact unstable , with infalling matter near the cauchy ( inner ) horizon being subject to an infinite blueshift of the type that has been repeatedly demonstrated for the reissner - nordstr@xmath0 m black hole . this instability is present even when an ultraviolet cutoff ( induced by anticipated non - commutative geometric effects ) to a field propagating in that spacetime is included . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this by following an analogous argument made for reissner - nordstr@xmath0 m black holes , and conclude that stability is dependent on the surface gravities @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the inner and outer horizons respectively . in general if @xmath3 , as we show to be the case here , then the stability of the cauchy horizon becomes highly questionable , contrary to recent claims .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of a convincing and self - contained theory of quantum gravity is arguably the most important and difficult problem in theoretical physics today . </S>",
    "<S> while no such theory has yet achieved this feat , a general tenet thought to be characteristic of quantum gravity is the presence of a natural small - scale cutoff of spacetime ; a  graininess \" if you will . </S>",
    "<S> this cutoff is expected to arise when approaching the planckian scale . </S>",
    "<S> one of the primary applications expected of quantum gravity is a better understanding of curvature singularities predicted by classical general relativity ; such divergent behavior is indicative of a breakdown in the classical theory and it is thought that such extremes will be placated by a proper treatment using quantum gravity . as such , much work has been performed towards understanding black holes in the context of quantum gravity theories . </S>",
    "<S> several metric solutions have been derived using arguments from these theories that are free of the @xmath4 singularities that plague classical solutions @xcite . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> when one imposes a small - scale cutoff one should hardly expect to find a divergence which classically results from trying to describe an infinitely small point in spacetime .    despite being regular at @xmath4 however , these quantum gravity black holes generically have more than one horizon . </S>",
    "<S> one therefore ought to be wary of their overall stability since it is well known that classical black holes with more than one horizon also exhibit divergent behavior at their inner horizon ( the cauchy horizon ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen to arise from the infinite blueshift of external radiation that occurs on the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the example of prime interest here will be the reissner - nordstr@xmath0 m black hole @xcite , though this instability is also found in kerr and kerr - newmann black holes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate whether or not this instability is present in the black hole solution inspired by noncommutative geometry @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one proposed solution to quantum gravity , motivated by the principle of small - scale cutoff , is to impose a noncommutative structure to the spacetime manifold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mathematics of noncommutative geometry is a generalization of differential geometry and its application to spacetime results in an uncertainty relation of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a matrix that quantifies the magnitude of the noncommutative deviation from a classical spacetime manifold ; its entries are postulated to be on the order of the planck area . </S>",
    "<S> this uncertainty relation implies that in this formulation there is no notion of a point - like event in spacetime , in the same way that in quantum mechanics there is no notion of an exact point in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to entirely changing the notion of what a manifold is , such a small - scale cutoff also changes the form of quantum fields propagating on the manifold by imposing a natural momentum cutoff on the order of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is defined to be the mean value of the matrix entries . </S>",
    "<S> both of these modifications are important in predicting the phenomena arising from this theory . as with other quantum gravity theories , </S>",
    "<S> work has progressed in deriving black hole solutions inspired by noncommutative geometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solution corresponding to the classical schwarzschild metric is @xmath9 the mass function @xmath10 is proportional to the total mass @xmath11 and a lower , incomplete gamma function @xmath12 . in the classical limit @xmath13 we see that @xmath14 and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ metric ] ) reverts to the schwarzschild metric .    </S>",
    "<S> this metric admits two horizons provided @xmath15 , below which point it becomes extremal . </S>",
    "<S> an example of this is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ metfunc ] ) where we plot the metric function @xmath16 with @xmath17 and the two cases @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the limiting value of approximately @xmath20 is determined from the conditions @xmath21 for some value @xmath22 ( the radius of the extremal horizon ) . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath23 can be used to find @xmath22 ; one can show that it is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 solves the equation @xmath26 . the value @xmath25 is numerically determined to be @xmath27 , with which the other condition @xmath28 can be used to obtain @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we will only consider conditions under which two horizons are present , and we will label the outer and inner horizons @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .    a preliminary investigation into the stability of this black hole claimed that it was stable with respect to blueshifted radiation ( with an ultraviolet cutoff ) at the cauchy horizon , since the energy density of an ingoing field pulse ( specifically , a gaussian pulse since a @xmath32-function pulse is forbidden by the ultraviolet cutoff ) was found to remain finite upon reaching the cauchy horizon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however this investigation neglected to examine perturbative scatterings from the primary pulse that occurs near the horizons . </S>",
    "<S> we will show here that such scattered waves to first order do have diverging energy densities at the cauchy horizon , a result which , while not conclusive , is highly indicative of overall instability . </S>",
    "<S> such a calculation was performed in @xcite to indicate the instability of the reissner - nordstr@xmath0 m black hole , and our analysis here will follow from the same line of reasoning </S>",
    "<S> .    we will find it convenient to use the tortoise coordinate @xmath33 and null coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 , defined as @xmath36    the non - commutative structure of spacetime suggests that there is an ultraviolet cutoff to matter fields , and consistent with previous work @xcite we shall impose the same on a massless matter field @xmath37 by including a factor of @xmath38 in the mode expansion . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting angular dependence , this modified field takes the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 solves @xmath41 and the potential is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the fields angular mode . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 vanishes at the horizons and near them can be shown to decay as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the surface gravities at the two horizons , defined as @xmath47    we are principally interested in the field near the inner horizon @xmath31 since this is where stability comes into question . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 will in general consist of two linearly independent solutions corresponding to left - moving ( ingoing ) and right - moving ( outgoing ) waves traveling along surfaces of constant @xmath35 and @xmath34 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at the inner horizon the field will be of the form @xmath48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will need to derive the form of @xmath49 and @xmath50 eventually . assuming that they are given , </S>",
    "<S> however , we can compute the energy density @xmath51 of the field as measured by a freely falling observer near the horizon with four - velocity @xmath52 ; we have @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> however , since @xmath54 are null surfaces , the form of @xmath37 near the horizons implies that this will be dominated by the @xmath55 term .    the four - velocity of a timelike , radial geodesic is found to be @xmath56 where we define @xmath57 to be negative since this will always be the case between the horizons @xmath58 ( since @xmath59 necessarily decreases for any observer in this region ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 is a constant of the motion , the sign of which gives the direction of travel between the horizons ; @xmath61 corresponds to a left - moving observer and @xmath62 to a right - moving one .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to compute the energy density @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easily seen that @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the derivative of @xmath67 with respect to @xmath35 or @xmath34 depending on the sign . with this </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath68    let us examine this result in the limit @xmath69 . recalling that @xmath70 vanishes at the horizons , for a left - moving observer ( @xmath61 ) we see that @xmath71 remains finite but @xmath72 diverges , unless of course @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> can compensate for the divergence . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for a right - moving observer ( @xmath62 ) @xmath71 diverges while @xmath72 remains finite . assuming the black hole is non - extremal the metric function near @xmath31 is @xmath74 , and </S>",
    "<S> so the divergence goes as @xmath75 for @xmath76 .    from the form of @xmath70 near @xmath31 we also obtain the tortoise coordinate : @xmath77 , </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath78    for a right - moving observer near @xmath31 it is easily shown that @xmath79 , from which we obtain @xmath80    this gives us the form of the divergence in @xmath71 expressed in null coordinates ( recall that as @xmath69 , @xmath81 for a right - moving observer and @xmath82 for a left - moving one ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath83    thus , if the inner horizon is to remain stable then @xmath84 must decay at least as fast as @xmath85 in order to placate the divergence as @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar analysis shows that @xmath73 must decay at least as fast as @xmath86 in order to stop the divergence of @xmath72 as @xmath87 for observers with @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> our goal now is now to compute these quantities to determine stability .    in order to compute @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce a calculation used in @xcite to determine the inner horizon stability of the reissner - nordstr@xmath0 m black hole . </S>",
    "<S> since we are only interested in the field near the horizons , where the potential is exceedingly small , we can decompose the total solution to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ simply ] ) , which we will call @xmath88 , into the zero - potential solution @xmath40 plus an infinitesimal perturbation @xmath89 produced by the small potential : @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> we set the initial conditions to consist only of ingoing waves and we choose the time dependence to be @xmath91 ; this requires that @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> an ingoing ( left - moving ) wave will scatter off of the small potential near the horizons , and these scatterings are represented by @xmath89 . in the analysis performed in @xcite only the the main waves @xmath40 were considered , and it was found that the energy density due to these waves remains finite on @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> however they neglected to consider scattered waves @xmath89 , and it is these waves that ( as we will show ) give rise to instability , for reasons similar to that for a reissner - nordstr@xmath0 m black hole @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two scatterings that are of potential interest with regard to stability at the inner horizon . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ scat ] shows a section of the penrose diagram ( including the external universe and the @xmath58 region ) with the two scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> the first of these consists of right - moving waves traveling along the left branch of @xmath31 ; these would have scattered off of the main wave as it neared @xmath31 and they are labeled with a 1 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scat ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for these waves we must check the form of @xmath73 to test for stability . </S>",
    "<S> the second scattering of interest consists of left - moving waves which travel along the right branch of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> these waves can form by the following process : consider a scattering produced just after the main wave has entered from the outer horizon ; it would be right - moving and traveling along @xmath30 . as this wave approaches the intersection of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the penrose diagram it enters a region of strong potential . seeing as the wave magnitude </S>",
    "<S> is assumed to be very small , a strong potential would be expected to scatter this wave again with effectively 100% efficiency ; in this case the entire wave is scattered such that it is now a left - moving wave traveling along the right branch of @xmath31 as labeled by a 2 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scat ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for these waves we must check the form of @xmath84 to test for stability .        in order to solve for @xmath89 </S>",
    "<S> we use a green s function @xmath93 , @xmath94 having chosen an @xmath91 time dependence , we opt for the solution @xmath95    now , since @xmath90 solves eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ simply ] ) while @xmath40 solves the same equation with the potential set to zero , we have that @xmath89 approximately solves @xmath96 the solution of which is @xmath97    we must pause now as the form of @xmath89 is not actually the field that we should use if we are considering a noncommutative spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising once one recognizes that the @xmath32-function in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cangreen ] ) is not an allowed object given a noncommutative context . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore not use the canonical green s function @xmath93 as we have defined it here . </S>",
    "<S> we instead must use a modified green s function @xmath98 , presented in @xcite , which is derived in the noncommutative framework . </S>",
    "<S> this modified green s function takes the form @xmath99 the operator @xmath100 acts to smear out point - like objects in order to accommodate the spacetime uncertainty of noncommutative geometry . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to a @xmath32-function , for example , it outputs a gaussian of width @xmath101 .    given the solution for @xmath93 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cangreen2 ] ) we can rather easily compute the modified green s function . for the @xmath102 region </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath103 and a similar result follows from the @xmath104 region . </S>",
    "<S> in total we have @xmath105 the noncommutative - modified perturbation field that we wish to use is then given by @xmath106    here we are interested in the scattering produced by the outer horizon potential @xmath107 , @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> for purposes of computational ease let us set @xmath109 for @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate this integral for @xmath111 since this will be the case when the wave approaches @xmath31 , which is what we are interested in . identifying @xmath92 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain trivially @xmath112 including time dependence we obtain the right - moving wave : @xmath113    we now need to evaluate the total wave consisting of all modes . </S>",
    "<S> given @xmath114 the main wave consists of an ingoing , gaussian pulse @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> the total perturbation over all modes is @xmath116    as explained above , when this wave approaches the intersection of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the penrose diagram it will be entering a region of high potential , which can be expected to scatter the small wave with near 100% efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we assume this condition here , and so the wave after this second scattering will be of the same form as that just derived but traveling leftwards instead of rightwards . </S>",
    "<S> recalling eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ total ] ) , we thus have the form of @xmath117 for this wave @xmath118    in order to test for stability , however , we require the derivative @xmath119 which integrates to @xmath120\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath121 the complimentary error function approaches @xmath122 \\rightarrow 2 $ ] , so it is unimportant in the decay behavior . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we see that @xmath123 decays as @xmath124 for an observer approaching the right branch of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> recall that the necessary condition for stability is that @xmath123 decays at least as fast as @xmath85 , and thus the problem now becomes one of comparing the two surface gravities @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , if @xmath3 then @xmath123 does not decay fast enough to suppress the divergence present in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cond ] ) and @xmath31 is unstable . for the noncommutative black hole </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the case , as we will show .    </S>",
    "<S> first recall that there were two possible divergences that could occur at @xmath31 , the other one generated by fields near the left branch of @xmath31 and with stability contingent on @xmath125 decaying at least as fast as @xmath86 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a similar analysis can be performed and it can be shown that it _ does _ decay fast enough , and so the cauchy horizon is stable in this respect .    turning to the more interesting case , </S>",
    "<S> the surface gravities are defined to be @xmath126 , where the metric function @xmath16 is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ metric ] ) . taking the derivative of @xmath70 and using the horizon relation @xmath127 we find @xmath128 the metric function @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> is given by a lower , incomplete gamma function , as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ metric ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as such , its derivative is easily computed , thus giving us expressions for @xmath46 as functions of @xmath129 @xmath130    the task now is to compute the values of @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> looking at fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ metfunc2 ] ) ( plotting the metric function for @xmath17 and @xmath19 ) we see that @xmath131 ( that is , the slope is steeper at @xmath31 than it is at @xmath30 ) , yielding an instability at @xmath31 . to confirm this result in the general we consider two regimes : @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in the intermediate regime between these values </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath131 , either numerically or simply by plotting @xmath16 , as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ metfunc2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we first examine the @xmath132 regime . </S>",
    "<S> to do so we note that @xmath129 are given by the intersections of the mass function @xmath10 and the line @xmath134 ; to visualize this we plot the two functions for the case of @xmath17 and @xmath135 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inter ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that in this case @xmath31 is small and @xmath30 is equal to @xmath136 to a very good approximation ( since the mass function levels off to the constant @xmath137 by the time @xmath134 intersects it ) . as we increase @xmath11 with respect to @xmath138 these statements only become stronger .     and the line @xmath134 for the case of @xmath17 and @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> the intersections determine the values of @xmath129.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    thus , in this regime we will take @xmath139 for the outer horizon . for the inner horizon </S>",
    "<S> we utilize the fact that @xmath31 is small and we taylor expand @xmath10 about @xmath4 ; it can be shown that the first non - vanishing derivative is @xmath140 and so for small @xmath59 the mass function is well approximated by a cubic function @xmath141 we compute @xmath31 by finding the intersection of this with @xmath134 ; along with our result for @xmath30 we have @xmath142 inserting these results into the surface gravities , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ surfgrav ] ) , we obtain @xmath143 from which it can be seen that @xmath2 will generally decrease and @xmath1 increase as @xmath144 increases . </S>",
    "<S> indeed as @xmath145 we have @xmath146 and @xmath147 , as should be expected . </S>",
    "<S> having observed that @xmath3 for intermediate values of @xmath144 we thus conclude that this inequality will continue to hold as @xmath144 increases indefinitely .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we wish to examine the @xmath133 regime ; in this case we simply evaluated @xmath129 numerically for several values of @xmath11 and @xmath8 and inserted these values into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ surfgrav ] ) to compute @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this exercise are displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kap ] ) where we plot @xmath46 versus @xmath144 for @xmath148 and @xmath17 . as can be seen </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 continues to be greater than @xmath2 as @xmath149 .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that @xmath3 in general , and this implies that the cauchy horizon of the noncommutative geometry inspired black hole is always unstable with respect to the perturbative scatterings described . </S>",
    "<S> since the scatterings are assumed to be small the fact that they diverge reflects a breakdown in our approximation , and so we can not yet say with absolute certainty that the cauchy horizon is indeed unstable . however , such a divergence is certainly indicative of instability , casting doubt on previous claims for this black hole @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this type of analysis is easily performed for any two - horizon black hole , although the scalar field modifications ( if any ) will be particular to the theory in question . for example </S>",
    "<S> , the authors have also applied similar reasoning to a black hole motivated by loop quantum gravity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this work suggest that the loop black hole may have stronger stability properties than the one being scrutinized in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> one might argue that the infalling pulse of scalar field is not a generic form of infalling matter . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore consider a stress - energy corresponding to an ingoing null dust present on the manifold , but we neglect the back reaction this induces in the metric . </S>",
    "<S> this is of course an approximation , but no more of one than was already being assumed in the precious analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that the resulting energy density as seen by a timelike observer crossing the cauchy horizon will , instead of being of the form @xmath150 , rather go like @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the  luminosity \" of the null dust . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath152 is expected to follow an inverse power law in the large @xmath35 limit , as first shown by price @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus in this scenario there is no way to avoid diverging energy density as @xmath121 , unlike in the previous analysis where the competition between two exponentials afforded some hope of this .    </S>",
    "<S> first we cast the metric , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ metric ] ) , in @xmath153 coordinates ; the result is @xmath154 where the metric function @xmath16 is unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> we then consider a stress - energy tensor which corresponds to an ingoing null dust . </S>",
    "<S> it takes the form @xmath155    with these last two equations we determine the form of @xmath156 by computing the conservation condition @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that we must have @xmath158 , where @xmath152 is an arbitrary function of @xmath35 and @xmath159 must satisfy the equation @xmath160 the solution of which is @xmath161 thus , without loss of generality ( since @xmath152 is arbitrary ) we conclude that @xmath156 is given by @xmath162    far from the black hole the spacetime is well approximated by a schwarzschild solution , and we note that this form of @xmath156 is exactly the same result as that obtained for the schwarzschild black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we thus identify @xmath152 with the usual luminosity , and we expect the analysis by price @xcite to hold to a good approximation in our case as well . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we have @xmath163 with @xmath164 .    in order to determine the energy density a timelike observer would measure from this dust we also need to specify the four - velocity of the observer . </S>",
    "<S> this was previously done for @xmath165 and @xmath57 , and it is easy to show that @xmath166 takes the form @xmath167 where we recall that @xmath62 for an outgoing observer between the horizons ; this is the type of observer that we are interested in .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy density measure by such an observer is given by @xmath168 as the cauchy horizon is approached we have @xmath169 , and so the negativity of @xmath60 implies that @xmath170 as this approach takes place . </S>",
    "<S> we also know that near the cauchy horizon the metric function goes like @xmath171 , and so we obtain that the energy density has the behavior @xmath172 near the cauchy horizon . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath152 follows an inverse power law , we conclude that the observer measures diverging energy density upon crossing the cauchy horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> of course the preceding null dust calculation is not without its limitations . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the neglect of back - reaction effects , it is much less obvious how to include noncommutative modifications to this form of infalling matter , unlike the situation for the scalar field pulse . </S>",
    "<S> however the latter is not a generic form of infalling matter .    notwithstanding such considerations , </S>",
    "<S> our calculations provide strong evidence that the noncommutative black hole , while retaining finite curvature at @xmath4 , may have an unstable cauchy horizon . </S>",
    "<S> a more complete treatment of this problem will entail an analysis of the phenomenon of mass inflation @xcite , in which the mass function of the reissner - nordstr@xmath0 m black hole diverges at the cauchy horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this approach takes into account back - reaction effects from the geometry . the suggestion that mass inflation can not occur for the noncommutative black hole with ultraviolet restricted fields @xcite appears to be predicated on the claim of finite energy densities , a result that we have now seen does not ensure stability . </S>",
    "<S> a more rigorous analysis of mass inflation in this case is needed before one can make conclusions either way . </S>"
