    "it may be that the felobal qso phenomenon is a phase in which the central super - massive black hole is strongly obscured by the surrounding material .",
    "the spectra of some of these objects are indeed redder than the spectra of typical agn , which could signify thermal re - processing of the underlying central  engine emission . at some point , due to either an ejection event or a wind , the outer envelope of this cloud",
    "would be blown away . in the spectra of these objects we see spectral features that appear to be consistent with this .",
    "in fact , they appear much the same as the p - cygni profiles that are seen in objects that have winds .",
    "we present models that are consistent with this scenario .",
    "we are beginning to model felobals , assuming a single spherically symmetric line forming region , with synow and phoenix in an attempt to to understand more about their physical properties .",
    "synow is a paramterized spectral synthesis code used for line identification in spectra of supernovae and supernova  like events .",
    "the major assumptions are spherical symmetry , @xmath0 ( velocity ) @xmath1 ( radius ) , and that the line source functions are those of resonance scattering .",
    "synow s strengths are speed and inclusion of multiple scattering while using a large atomic line list .",
    "it is difficult , however , to quantitatively interpret the results of synow in terms of physical parameters .",
    "phoenix assumes a one - dimensional atmosphere either in spherical or slab geometry .",
    "greatest strength is its self - consistent solution of the radiation field with the nlte atomic level populations .",
    "phoenix requires only a few input parameters , most of which are observable .",
    "this can result in a high degree of physical realism",
    ".    phoenix can be used with lte or nlte level populations . with phoenix",
    "we match observables with the initial boundary conditions in the hope of deriving realistic physical parameters .",
    "the boundary conditions are the luminosity and the pressure at the outside of the atmosphere .",
    "input parameters include : the maximim velocity of the ejecta , the chemical compositions , etc .",
    "in addition phoenix can use a variety of velocity laws for the atmosphere including those used in winds and supernovae .",
    "phoenix calculates the spectrum self - consistently therefore providing reliable information about temperatures and densities , and the kinetic energy and mass - loss rate for the ejected atmosphere .",
    "we have used synow to fit the spectrum of iso j005645.1273816 ( duc et al .",
    "2002 ) identifying lines of c  iii , mg  ii , al  iii , si  ii , cr  ii , fe  ii , fe  iii , and ni  ii ( figure  1 ) . in the synthetic spectrum ,",
    "almost all of the features that are not labeled are produced by fe  ii .",
    "the model has a velocity at the photosphere of 1500  , a power law optical depth distribution with index of @xmath2 , and an excitation temperature of 7000  k. the two emission spikes in the observed spectrum that are marked with crosses are spurious .",
    "the spectrum of another felobal , fbqs1214 + 2803 ( white et  al .",
    "2002 ) was studied with synow by branch et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who emphasized the need for a more detailed self - consistent calculation .",
    "we have calculated a phoenix model for fbqs1214 + 2803 with the following physical parameters : a luminosity of l=@xmath3 ergs  s@xmath4 , which with an effective temperature of @xmath5  k corresponds to a radius of @xmath6  cm .",
    "we used @xmath7 km  @xmath4 , @xmath8 , solar metallicity , lte , and a power law density structure with an index of @xmath9 .",
    "this density structure is probably more correct for an ejection event than a wind and in the future we intend to explore other density distributions such as @xmath2 which would be expected for a wind .",
    "the pressure at the surface is set to be @xmath10 ergs  @xmath11 .",
    "so far we have only investigated the region of the mg  ii doublet . with this set of parameters and boundary conditions we can clearly see the mg  ii feature ( figure  2 ) .",
    "however , the mg  ii optical depth appears to be too low and the emission peak is slightly blue - shifted perhaps due to the absorption feature of a redder line .",
    "this may be fixed by introducing nlte and finding a more adequate realization of physical conditions that increase the optical depth of mg  ii and reduce the optical depths of other features .",
    "given the input parameters above our model implies a mass loss rate of @xmath12 m@xmath13  yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is high , and if correct may imply an ejection event .",
    "however , these are preliminary models and with a more satisfactory set of input parameters the final result will differ .",
    "we have shown that the resonance scattering interpretation of at least some felobal spectra needs to be considered . in particular , the synow model of iso j005645.1273816 is superb .",
    "however much more work needs to be done .",
    "we need to do nlte calculations and explore additional density and velocity structures .",
    "we also need to model iso j005645.1273816 and other felobals to learn the extent to which the resonance scattering interpretation is applicable ."
