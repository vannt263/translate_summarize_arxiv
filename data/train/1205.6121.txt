    "the nature of phase transition of a thermodynamic system is usually determined by inspecting into the discontinuity in the relevant thermodynamic quantities at the critical point@xcite . while the first order phase transition is characterized by the discontinuity in the temperature of the system , any discontinuity in the specific heat gives rise to a higher order phase transition . since black holes are considered as thermodynamic objects one may also expect phase transition in these systems .",
    "earlier research works revealed that phase transitions indeed occur in black holes@xcite , @xcite-@xcite . in order to determine the order of phase transition in black holes we generally use the ehrenfest s equations for black holes where the usual thermodynamic variables are replaced by those for the black holes@xcite .",
    "we can further explore the stability of the third order lbi - ads black hole by analyzing the specific heat of the black hole .",
    "the negative value of specific heat gives rise to the unstable configuration of the black hole whereas the positive value of the specific heat makes the black hole stable .",

    "this rules out the possibility of first order phase transition . in our subsequent analysis",
    "we will see that the specific heat at constant charge ( @xmath67 ) shows an infinite discontinuity at the critical points which correspond to the ` hump ' and ` dip ' of the @xmath65 plots respectively . without going into the algebraic details ,",
    "we can argue , from our previous work@xcite , that this corresponds to a continuous higher order phase transition . in order to study the critical phenomena in the canonical ensemble framework",

    "we can argue that , the helmhotz free energy is an usual homogeneous function for the third order lbi - ads black hole .",
    "moreover , we can determine the critical exponents ( @xmath101 ) once we calculate the scaling parameters .",
    "this is because these critical exponents are related to the scaling parameters as@xcite , @xmath102    there are two other critical exponents associated with the behavior of the _ correlation function _ and _ correlation length _ of the system near the critical surface .",

    "although we have calculated @xmath103 and @xmath104 assuming the additional scaling relations to be valid , it is not proven yet that these scaling relations are indeed valid for the black holes .",
    "one may adapt different techniques to calculate @xmath103 and @xmath104 , but till now no considerable amount of progress has been made in this direction .",
    "one may compute these two exponents directly from the correlation of scalar modes in the theory of gravitation@xcite but the present theories of critical phenomena in black holes are far from complete .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the critical phenomena in higher curvature charged black holes in a canonical framework . for this purpose",
    "we have considered the third order lovelock - born - infeld - ads ( lbi - ads ) black holes in a spherically symmetric space - time .",
    "we systematically derived the thermodynamic quantities for such black holes .",
    "we are able to show that some of the thermodynamic quantities ( @xmath113 , @xmath95 ) diverge at the critical points . from the nature of the plots we argue that there is a higher order phase transition in this black hole .",
    "although the analytical estimation of the critical points is not possible due to the complexity of the relevant equations , we are able to determine the critical points numerically .",
    "however , all the critical exponents are calculated analytically near the critical points . unlike the ads black holes in the einstein gravity ,",
    "one interesting property of the higher curvature black holes is that the usual area law of entropy does not hold for these black holes .",
    "one might then expect that the critical exponents may differ form those for the ads black holes in the einstein gravity .",
    "but we find that all the critical exponents in the third order lbi - ads black hole are indeed identical with those obtained in einstein gravity@xcite . from this observation",
    "we may conclude that these black holes belong to the same universality class .",
    "moreover , the critical exponents take the mean field values .",
    "it is to be noted that these black holes have distinct set of critical exponents which does not match with the critical exponents of any other known thermodynamic systems .",
    "another point that must be stressed is that the static critical exponents are independent of the spatial dimensionality of the ads space - time .",
    "this suggests the mean field behavior in black holes as thermodynamic systems and allows us to study the phase transition phenomena in the black holes .",
    "we have also discussed the static scaling laws and static scaling hypothesis .",
    "the static critical exponents are found to satisfy the static scaling laws near the critical points .",
    "we have checked the consistency of the static scaling hypothesis .",
    "apart from this we note that the two scaling parameters have identical values .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the helmhotz free energy is indeed a homogeneous function for this type of black hole .",
    "we have determined the two other critical exponents @xmath104 and @xmath103 associated with the correlation length ( @xmath106 ) and correlation function ( @xmath105 ) near the critical surface assuming the validity of the additional scaling laws .",
    "the values of these two exponents are found to be @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively in the six spatial dimensions .",
    "although the other six critical exponents are independent of the spatial dimension of the system , these two exponents are very much dimension dependent .    in our analysis",
    "we have been able to resolve a number of vexing issues concerning the critical phenomena in third order lbi - ads black holes .",
    "but there still remains some unsolved problems that encourage one to make further investigations into the system .",
    "first of all , we have made a qualitative argument about the nature of the phase transition in this black hole .",
    "one needs to go through detailed algebraic analysis in order to determine the true order of the phase transition@xcite-@xcite .",
    "secondly , we have calculated the values of the exponents @xmath104 and @xmath103 assuming that the additional scaling relations hold for this black hole .",
    "but there is no evidence whether these two laws hold for the black hole@xcite .",
    "these scaling relations may or may not hold for the black hole .",
    "the dimension dependence of these two exponents ( @xmath104 and @xmath103 ) makes the issue highly nontrivial in higher dimensions . a further attempt to determine @xmath103 and @xmath104 may be based on ruppeiner s prescription @xcite , where it is assumed that the absolute value of the thermodynamic scalar curvature ( @xmath114 ) is proportional to the correlation volume @xmath115 : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the spatial dimension of the black hole .",
    "now if we can calculate @xmath118 using the standard method@xcite , we can easily determine @xmath106 from ( 81 ) . evaluating @xmath106 around the critical point @xmath90 as before , we can determine @xmath104 directly .",
    "it is then straight forward to calculate @xmath103 by using ( 80 ) .",
    "this alternative approach , based on ruppeiner s prescription , to determine @xmath104 and @xmath103 needs high mathematical rigor and also the complexity in the determination of the scalar curvature ( @xmath118 ) in higher dimensions makes the issue even more challenging .",
    "finally , it would be highly nontrivial if we aim to investigate the ads / cft duality as an alternative approach to make further insight into the theory of critical phenomena in these black holes .",
    "the _ renormalization group _ method may be another alternative way to describe the critical phenomena in these black holes .",

    "<S> in this paper we have studied the critical phenomena in higher curvature charged black holes in the anti - de sitter ( ads ) space - time . as an example </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the third order lovelock - born - infeld black holes in ads space - time . </S>",
    "<S> we have analytically derived the thermodynamic quantities of the system . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis revealed the onset of a higher order phase transition in the black hole leading to an infinite discontinuity in the specific heat at constant charge at the critical points . </S>",
    "<S> our entire analysis is based on the canonical framework where we have fixed the charge of the black hole . in an attempt to study the behavior of the thermodynamic quantities near the critical points we have derived the critical exponents of the system explicitly . although the values of the critical points have been determined numerically , the critical exponents are calculated analytically . </S>",
    "<S> our results fit well with the thermodynamic scaling laws . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling hypothesis is also seen to be consistent with these scaling laws . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all types of ads black holes , studied so far , indeed belong to the same universality class . </S>",
    "<S> moreover these results are consistent with the mean field theory approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived the suggestive values of the other two critical exponents associated with the correlation function and correlation length on the critical surface . </S>"
