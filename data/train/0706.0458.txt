    "if the observed production cross section were to differ significantly from the standard model prediction , it would be evidence of new physics , such as exotic top quark decays or new production mechanisms such as @xmath0 resonances  @xcite .",

    "the fermilab tevatron collider , a proton anti - proton accelerator , collided beams at a center - of - mass energy of 1.8 tev during the period of operation ( run i ) between 1992 and 1996 .",

    "after significant improvements to both the accelerator and the d0 detector , run ii began in march 2001 with the collider operating at a center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev .",
    "the increased energy brought an increase in the top quark pair production cross section of @xmath2130% .",
    "the analyses discussed in this paper are based on approximately 425 pb@xmath3 of data collected by d0 between april 2002 and august 2004 .",
    "d0 has performed a similar measurement using @xmath22230 pb@xmath3 of data  @xcite .",
    "this section presents an overview of the experimental apparatus , emphasizing the subsystems most relevant to the @xmath0 production cross section measurement .",
    "a more complete description of the upgraded experiment can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the d0 detector comprises three major subsystems which together identify and measure the energy or momentum of electrons , jets , muons , and ( indirectly ) neutrinos  all of which can be found in the final states of @xmath0 decays .",
    "the subsystems are the central tracking detectors , a uranium / liquid - argon calorimeter , and a muon spectrometer .",
    "the spatial coordinates of the d0 detector are defined as follows : the positive @xmath23 direction is along the direction of the proton motion while positive @xmath24 is defined as upward with respect to the detector s center , which serves as the origin .",
    "the polar angle @xmath25 is measured with respect to the positive @xmath23 direction and the azimuthal angle @xmath26 is measured with respect to the positive @xmath27 direction .",
    "the radial distance @xmath28 is the perpendicular displacement from the @xmath23 axis .",
    "the polar direction is more usually described by the pseudorapidity , defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the central tracking detectors consist of a silicon microstrip tracker ( smt ) and a central scintillating fiber tracker ( cft ) located within a 2 t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "together these detectors are responsible for locating the position of the hard scatter and for measuring the trajectories and momenta of charged particles .",
    "the smt can also locate displaced , secondary vertices which aid in heavy quark tagging .",
    "it is composed of high - resistivity silicon sensors arranged in barrels and disks to maximize the detector surface area perpendicular to charged particle trajectories .",
    "the barrel detectors provide tracking information at central values of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , while the disks extend coverage out to @xmath32 3.0 .",
    "the cft is constructed from scintillating fibers mounted on eight concentric support cylinders .",
    "each cylinder supports an axial layer of fibers oriented along @xmath23 and a stereo layer oriented at a slight angle with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "the outermost cylinder provides coverage for @xmath33 .",
    "the liquid - argon calorimeter surrounds the central tracking detectors .",
    "in addition to providing energy measurements for electrons , photons , and jets , it can distinguish showers generated by electrons or photons from those produced by hadrons .",
    "the calorimeter also plays a critical role in the measurement of the event - wide transverse energy balance used to identify neutrinos .",
    "the system is composed of three parts : a central calorimeter ( cc ) which provides coverage to @xmath34 1 and north and south endcap calorimeters ( ec ) which extend coverage to @xmath32 4 .",
    "because each calorimeter is housed in its own cryostat , there is a gap in coverage between each ec and the cc , the region defined by @xmath35 . to partially compensate for this",
    ", an intercryostat detector ( icd ) made of a series of scintillating tiles is located between the cc and ec cryostats .",
    "each calorimeter section has three subsections : an inner electromagnetic ( em ) section which uses thin uranium absorber plates , a fine hadronic section which uses uranium - niobium alloy plates , and a coarse hadronic section which uses copper or stainless steel absorber plates in the cc or ec , respectively .",
    "the calorimeters are transversely divided into _ projective _ towers , so - called because the rays along which the calorimeter cells are oriented project outward from the interaction center .",
    "each tower layer is further divided into segments of size @xmath36 @xmath37 0.1 @xmath38 @xmath3964 , except for the third layer of the em section which is segmented twice as finely to allow for more precise measurement of the em shower centroid .",
    "the muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeter cryostats and uses a combination of wire chambers and scintillation counters to obtain precise muon spatial and timing information , respectively . like the calorimeter ,",
    "the muon spectrometer consists of three separate subdetectors .",
    "the central detector covers approximately @xmath40 and the forward systems extend to @xmath41 .",
    "each system contains three layers of instrumentation , and a 1.8 t iron toroidal magnet is located between the innermost and second layers .",
    "each layer contains both wire chambers and scintillation counters .",
    "the scintillators have response times sufficiently fast to allow for both muon triggering and out - of - time background rejection .",
    "the wire chambers in the central region are proportional drift tubes ( pdts ) oriented to provide maximum resolution for measuring muon bending angles produced by the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the innermost central scintillation counters are segmented in 4.5@xmath42 increments in @xmath26 to match the cft segmentation .",
    "each layer of the forward spectrometers contains several strata of mini drift tubes ( mdts ) and a set of scintillation counters referred to as _",
    "pixels_. the pixels are projectively arranged from the interaction point with a @xmath26 segmentation of 4.5@xmath42 and an @xmath43 segmentation of @xmath210.12 .",
    "the luminosity measurement is based on the rate of inelastic @xmath1 collisions observed by the luminosity monitors ( lm ) mounted in front of the ec cryostats at @xmath44 .",
    "the lm consists of two arrays of 24 plastic scintillator counters with photomultiplier readout , and covers the @xmath30 range between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the uncertainty on the luminosity measurement is currently estimated to be @xmath12 6.1%  @xcite .",
    "selection efficiencies for @xmath0 signal events and background survival rates for each of the analyses were computed using monte carlo simulations of each of the physics processes contributing to the observed event yields .",
    "this section provides some details regarding the generation of the monte carlo samples used .",
    "simulation began with initial parton generation .",
    "in general , this was achieved using the alpgen  @xcite generator , which contains the exact leading - order ( lo ) matrix elements for the processes discussed in the following sections . unless otherwise specified , output from alpgen",
    "was then convoluted with the cteq5l  @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "parton showering was carried out using pythia  @xcite .",
    "decays of @xmath47 mesons were simulated with evtgen  @xcite and @xmath20-lepton decays were simulated with tauola  @xcite .",
    "after the modeling of quark and gluon hadronization and unstable particle decays , the list of generated objects was passed through a geant - based  @xcite model of the d0 detector . this provides a detailed simulation of the effects of detector composition and geometry .",
    "resolutions for momenta and energies of leptons and jets , as well as efficiencies for their identification , were determined in data and compared to their counterparts in monte carlo . observed discrepancies were used to correct the simulated samples .",
    "detector acceptance , object reconstruction efficiencies , and the effects of kinematical cuts were estimated with a sample of simulated @xmath49 decays , where @xmath50 = @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath20 .",
    "seven samples were generated with the following values of top quark mass ( @xmath15 ) : 140 , 160 , 175 , 190 , and 210 gev . these were used to parameterize the signal acceptances as functions of @xmath15 .",
    "the central value of the cross section was computed for @xmath51 gev .",
    "the largest background to the @xmath0 dilepton signal arises from drell - yan @xmath53 production and leptonic decay with associated production of one or more jets . to aid in the estimation of these backgrounds",
    ", we generated @xmath54 events with one or two partons .",
    "for each lepton flavor we generated three @xmath55 regions : 1560 gev , 60130 gev , and @xmath56130 gev .",
    "the relative weights of the three samples were determined from the ratios of their lo cross sections .",
    "the absolute normalizations of these background samples were set by the number of @xmath53+jets @xmath57+jets events observed in control samples selected from data .",
    "these were chosen by requiring that the reconstructed dilepton mass be near the @xmath58 boson mass so that the samples were rejected by the signal selection criteria described in secs .",
    "[ sec : ee ] and [ sec : mumu ] .",
    "this normalization was carried out at an early stage of event selection where the @xmath0 yield is a negligible fraction of the selected sample .",
    "the efficiency of further kinematical selections for @xmath53 events was then derived from the details of the simulated samples .",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 ( where @xmath50 = @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) production in association with one or two jets contributes to a lesser degree to the selected samples . as for all the other monte carlo samples used , we generated these processes at lo with alpgen , but the impact of pdfs was simulated using cteq4l  @xcite .",
    "the resulting samples were normalized using the ratio of nlo to lo diboson production cross sections calculated without explicit jet requirements .",
    "the analyses described in this paper made use of data collected by triggering on the presence of objects consistent with the dilepton signature : electrons , muons , central tracks , and jets .",
    "correlations between these objects and event - wide variables like , though available at all trigger levels , were not utilized in data collection .",
    "this section begin with a brief description of the d0 trigger system and then provides a description of the triggering conditions used to collect the dilepton samples analyzed .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the triggering system is available in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the d0 triggering system consists of three separate levels , each of which examines successively fewer events in ever greater detail .",
    "the first stage ( level 1 ) is a collection of custom hardware triggers that accepts data from all the major detector subsystems at a rate of 1.7 mhz and generates an acceptance rate of around or below 2 khz . in the second stage ( level 2 ) , microprocessors associated with each detector subsystem",
    "reconstruct physics objects which are passed on to a global processor that generates decisions based upon all the objects in an event .",
    "level 2 provides a maximum accept rate of around 1 khz .",
    "the final trigger stage ( level 3 ) , applies more sophisticated algorithms to data from precision readout of the detector components to further reduce the overall acceptance rate to around 50 hz .",
    "events passing level 3 are written to tape .    at level 1 ,",
    "the muon trigger searches for patterns of scintillator and wire chamber hits consistent with muons traversing the multiple layers of the muon detector .",
    "_ loose _ level 1 muons are constructed from scintillator hits only , while _ tight _ muons include corresponding patterns of hits in wire chambers  . ] .",
    "additionally , some level 1 muon triggers require that a matching track be found by the central track trigger ( ctt ) .",
    "ctt tracks are found by analyzing patterns of axial cft hits .",
    "all eight axial layers must register a hit , and the curvature of the resulting patterns provides a @xmath16 estimate that is used for a threshold requirement .    at level 2",
    ", the muon - finding algorithm uses more precise timing information to improve the quality of muon candidates .",
    "in general , a combination of wire and scintillator hits both inside and outside the toroid iron is required .",
    "level 3 uses tracks found in the central tracker to identify the most probable position for the hard scatter .",
    "this position , also called the primary vertex , is used to refine momentum estimates from reconstructed muon - track bending by the toroidal field , and the result is used to apply momentum threshold requirements . additionally , level 3",
    "is capable of reconstructing central tracks with hits missing and its algorithms make use of cft stereo information .",
    "the level 1 calorimeter trigger inputs are electromagnetic ( em ) and hadronic ( h ) trigger tower energies summed over a transverse area of @xmath61 0.2 @xmath38 0.2 .",
    "electron candidates only include energy collected in the em section of the calorimeter , while jet candidate energies include the h towers . at level 2 ,",
    "calorimeter objects are reconstructed from trigger towers using the level 1 objects as seeds . the level 2 jet algorithm clusters 5 @xmath38 5 groups of towers centered on the seed towers .",
    "electron candidates are formed by clustering each em seed with the highest @xmath62 neighboring tower .    the level 3 calorimeter triggers use the precision readout chain and the reconstructed primary vertex position to improve energy and position resolution relative to level 2 .",
    "jets and electrons are formed using a simple cone algorithm  @xcite .",
    "_ loose _ level 3 electrons must have most of their energy deposited in the em layers and they must meet basic shower shape criteria .",
    "_ tight _ level 3 electrons must survive additional shape criteria . additional background suppression is also achieved in some triggers by requiring that a matching central track be found .",
    "the triggers used to collect the dilepton samples required that the lepton signatures distinguishing each channel were present at multiple triggering levels . in order to reduce rate but maintain overall trigger efficiency for a given channel , a logical or of",
    "multiple triggers having different conditions tightened in a complementary manner was sometimes used .",
    "brief summaries of the trigger conditions used for each analysis channel are presented here , and more detailed breakdowns of the requirements are available in appendix  [ sec : trig_appendix ] .",
    "the @xmath8 triggers required that an electron with an @xmath62 of at least 5 gev and a loose muon were found at level 1 . in some cases a level 2 muon was also required , but otherwise the remaining conditions involved electrons reconstructed at level 3 . a loose level 3 electron with @xmath63 10 gev was always included in the requirements , and at higher luminosity the energy threshold was increased and this requirement was combined in an or with a tight electron with @xmath64 gev .",
    "the dielectron triggers usually included the requirement that two electrons , each with @xmath63 6 gev , were found at level 1 . in some cases only one electron with @xmath63",
    "11 gev was required at level 1 .",
    "a level 2 requirement was only included for later periods containing high luminosity conditions .",
    "it required that two electrons , each with @xmath63 18 gev , be found .",
    "the level 3 condition always included at least one loose electron with @xmath63 10 gev . for later data taking periods ,",
    "a second electron was added to the level 3 condition , and the energy threshold and quality requirements were tightened .    to maximize efficiency , the @xmath10 channel made use of high @xmath16 single muon triggers and switched to dimuon trigger requirements when the single muon triggers were prescaled due to high rates .",
    "the single muon triggers required a tight muon at level 1 , while the dimuon triggers used loose level 1 muons .",
    "all triggers used for the dimuon channel demanded that one muon be found at level 2 , sometimes with a @xmath65 3 gev requirement .",
    "the level 3 requirements also involved single muon signatures , but complementary conditions were sometimes combined in a logical or .",
    "these signatures included a level 3 muon with a @xmath16 of at least 6 gev or a level 3 central track with a @xmath16 of at least 5 gev .",
    "since the @xmath50+track channels did not require that two identified leptons be found in each candidate event , they relied on high @xmath16 single lepton triggers . in some cases these triggers included jet requirements . at level 1 , the @xmath5+track triggers demanded the presence of either one em object with @xmath63 10 gev or two em objects , each with @xmath63 3 gev . in some cases",
    "the single electron condition was coupled with the requirement that two level 1 jets were found , each with @xmath63 5 gev .",
    "the level 2 conditions included the presence of one electron with @xmath63 10 gev .",
    "some triggers also asked that two jets , each with @xmath63 10 gev , be found at level 2 .",
    "level 3 requirements included at least one electron with @xmath63 15 gev .",
    "some triggers also required that two jets , each with @xmath63 15 gev , be found at level 3 .",
    "the @xmath6+track triggers required that at least one loose level 1 muon , sometimes with a matching central track , be found .",
    "some triggers also demanded that at least one jet with @xmath63 3 gev be found .",
    "the level 2 conditions usually required that one muon be found and sometimes also required one jet with @xmath63 8 gev to be present .",
    "level 3 conditions alternately included 1 jet with @xmath63 10 gev , one muon with @xmath65 15 gev , or one central track with @xmath65 10 gev .",
    "sometimes the track and muon requirements were combined in a logical or .",
    "the efficiencies of trigger conditions on single objects were estimated using data samples selected to remove triggering bias .",
    "the efficiency for a @xmath0 event to satisfy a trigger condition was then estimated by folding per - muon , per - electron , and per - jet efficiencies into monte carlo simulated events .",
    "a similar process was used for those background estimations that are based upon simulation .",
    "trigger terms related to electrons , muons , and tracks were analyzed using reconstructed @xmath58 boson decays to dilepton final states . in each such decay ,",
    "one lepton was matched to triggering and reconstruction requirements so that the other lepton could be used for unbiased efficiency measurements .",
    "this method , known as `` _ tag and probe _ , '' was used to perform most of the high @xmath16 lepton efficiency measurements used in the dilepton analyses .",
    "hadronic jet triggers were studied using events passing either muon - based or electron - based triggers .",
    "electron - triggered events were required to have exactly one electron that was both matched to electron trigger objects at all levels and separate from the jet considered in the efficiency measurement .",
    "efficiency measurements were parameterized in terms of the kinematic variables @xmath16 , @xmath43 , and @xmath26 of offline reconstructed objects .",
    "uncertainties in these parameterizations were derived from fits to the observed variable distributions .",
    "separate efficiencies were estimated for level 1 ( @xmath66 ) , level 2 ( @xmath67 ) , and level 3 ( @xmath68 ) conditions and the total event probability @xmath69 was estimated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the conditional probabilities for an event to satisfy a set of criteria provided it has already passed offline selection and previous levels of triggering .",
    "the overall trigger efficiency for @xmath0 events was then computed as the luminosity - weighted average of the event probabilities associated with each data taking period .",
    "charged particle trajectories were reconstructed from the patterns of energy deposits ( or `` hits '' ) that they left in the tracking detectors . track reconstruction at d0 involved two distinct steps : track finding and track fitting .",
    "two complementary track finding algorithms were used in event reconstruction .",
    "the first is a histogramming approach based upon the hough transform  a method originally developed for finding tracks in bubble chambers  @xcite .",
    "an alternate track - finding approach began with groups of hits in the smt barrels .",
    "these were fitted to a track hypothesis and the result was used to form a road in which to search for hits in additional detector layers .",
    "the candidate track lists resulting from the two track - finding approaches were combined and passed to a kalman  @xcite track fitter .",
    "this made use of an interacting propagator which propagates tracks through the d0 tracking system while taking into account magnetic curvature and interactions with detector material .",
    "the fitter incrementally adds hits to tracks using the input candidates to define roads .",
    "the resulting track fit allows for the calculation of optimal track parameters , with errors , on any surface .",
    "the tracking momentum scale was determined by comparing the dimuon invariant mass distribution for @xmath73 decays in data with expectation from simulation based upon the world average @xmath58 boson mass computed by the particle data group  @xcite . in order for the simulated track momentum resolutions to match those observed in the data sample , an additional random smearing of track parameters",
    "was performed .",
    "the measured transverse momentum resolution can be expressed as @xmath74 here @xmath16 is measured in gev and @xmath75 is the _",
    "normalized track bending lever arm_. @xmath75 is equal to 1 for tracks with @xmath76 1.62 and is computed as @xmath77/@xmath78 otherwise ( @xmath79 is the angle at which the track exits the tracker ) .      the principal task of primary vertex ( pv ) finding is to identify tracks originating from the hard scatter and to separate these from tracks generated in superimposed minimum bias events .",
    "the algorithm first reconstructed one or more vertices and then selected the hard scatter vertex from among them by considering the @xmath16 distribution and number of tracks associated with each vertex .",
    "the vertex reconstruction algorithm included three steps : track clustering , track selection , and vertex fitting .",
    "first , tracks were clustered in @xmath23 by considering their relative separations .",
    "second , tracks kept for fitting were required to have at least 2 smt hits and @xmath80 0.5 gev .",
    "each track s distance of closest approach in the @xmath27-@xmath24 plane ( @xmath81 ) to the nominal interaction position was also considered : the @xmath81 significance ( @xmath82 ) for a candidate track had to be less than 3 .",
    "finally , for every @xmath23 cluster , an iterative vertex search yielded a vertex position .",
    "a probability that a vertex originated from a minimum - bias interaction was assigned based on the transverse momenta of its associated tracks .",
    "the vertex with the lowest probability was selected as the _ primary _ , or hard scatter , vertex .",
    "to further ensure the quality of selected primary vertex candidates , we required that they be within the smt fiducial region ( @xmath83 cm ) and that they have at least three associated tracks .    in multijet data events ,",
    "the position resolution of the primary vertex in the transverse plane is around 35 @xmath6 m , convoluted with a typical beam spot size of 30 @xmath6 m .",
    "the vertex resolution in the direction of the beam line is @xmath211 mm .",
    "muon identification was based on matches between charged particles found in the central tracking system and trajectories reconstructed in the muon systems .",
    "tracks in the muon detectors comprised straight - line segments , or _ stubs _ , formed from combinations of scintillator and wire chamber hits in a single layer .",
    "stubs were formed separately inside and outside the toroid iron and then paired together ( provided their combinations were consistent with expectations for muons originating in the interaction region ) .",
    "pairs were fitted to trajectories using knowledge of the toroidal magnetic field and the expected effects of energy loss and multiple scattering .",
    "the resulting _ local _ muon momenta were used , along with the directions of the muons at the inner surface of the muon system , to search for consistent central tracks with which to form a _ global _ match .",
    "stubs that were not used in forming local muons were also used in global matches . in all cases , the results of the original central track",
    "fits were taken as the best estimates of muons momenta , since the resolution of the central tracker is far superior to that of the local muon system .    to reduce the impact of muon detector noise , requirements were made on the number and location of scintillator and wire chamber hits .",
    "two sets of muon quality requirements were used in the analyses discussed in this paper : _ tight _ and _ loose_. tight muons were required to have wire and scintillator hits both inside and outside the toroid iron .",
    "the loose criteria also accepted muons formed from single stubs with both types of hits either inside or outside the toroid .",
    "central tracks pointing into the fiducial volume of the muon detectors ( _ i.e. _ , with @xmath762 ) were considered as candidates for matches to muon tracks . to ensure that a central track was well - reconstructed , the @xmath84 per degree of freedom of the kalman",
    "fit used by the central tracking algorithm was required to be less than 4 .",
    "consistency between candidate tracks and the primary vertex was ensured by two additional cuts : the @xmath81 significance of each track must have been less than 3 and the smallest distance in @xmath23 between it and the primary vertex ( pv ) must have been less than 1 cm .",
