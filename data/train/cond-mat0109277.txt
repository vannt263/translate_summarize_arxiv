    "recently , cds / hgs / cds@xcite and cdte / hgte / cdte@xcite particles , termed quantum - dot quantum wells ( qdqw ) , have been formed in water .",
    "there are three preparation stages in the synthesis of these qdqws : ( i ) formation of the cds ( cdte ) core ; ( ii ) substitution of the mercury ions for the surface cadmium ions which results in a monolayer of the hgs ( hgte ) covering the core ; ( iii ) growing the cds ( cdte ) cap layer onto the surface of the dot . a schematic picture of typical cds / hgs / cds / h@xmath4o and cdte / hgte / cdte / h@xmath4o qdqws and their band structure are shown in fig .",
    "high - resolution transmission electron microscopy images revealed@xcite that both qdqws are not spherical , but are preferentially truncated tetrahedric particles .",
    "however , spherical shell particles are commonly considered to interpret experimental data ( see refs .  ) .",
    "the first theoretical study of qdqw electron and hole energy spectra was made by using the parabolic approximation for the conduction and valence bands.@xcite however , the position of exited hole levels and the hole localization could not be explained in that model .",
    "therefore , it was necessary to take into account all six hole bands@xcite .",
    "jaskolski and bryant have applied@xcite this model to a hole in qdqws . to obtain the electron spectrum ,",
    "they have used the perturbation theory for the one - band effective mass schrdinger equation with an energy - dependent mass correction .",

    "[ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] , the conduction band is parabolic only at the bottom , and even in the region of the electron ground state energy the deviation from parabolicity is very strong . because of the inverted band structure , the coupling between the conduction and valence bands should be included explicitly . in order to simultaneously describe the nonparabolicity of the conduction band and the influence of the conduction band on the valence bands , we consider the 8-band pidgeon and brown model@xcite which takes into account both the coupling of conduction and valence bands and the complex structure of the valence band .",
    "the exact electron and hole spectra are a starting point to calculate the exciton spectrum and oscillator strengths of the exciton transitions .",
    "they are required to analyze zero - phonon , one - phonon , and multi - phonon lines in the photoluminescence spectra of these qdqws , and to compare the obtained results with the experiment@xcite . in the nonadiabatic theory@xcite of the phonon - assisted optical transitions in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) the heights of the phonon peaks in the photoluminescence spectrum",

    "all these facts together as well as the aforementioned inadequacy of the previously used models make it desirable and useful to calculate the exact electron and hole spectra using the 8-band model .    in our previous work@xcite , using the burt s envelope function representation@xcite , we have extended the 8@xmath58 model to include heterostructures . in present paper",
    "we apply our rigorous 8-band model for spherical quantum - dot heterostructures , namely for qdqws . in the next section",

    "the 1.5  nm in diameter cdte core is successively covered by 1 ml of hgte ( 0.4  nm ) and 3 mls of cdte ( 1.2  nm ) .",
    "the 8-band energy structures of cds / hgs and cdte / hgte , calculated from the bulk effective - mass parameters listed in table  [ tab ] , are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] correspondingly .",
    "to investigate electron and hole states in qdqws we use the 8-band effective - mass model extended to include heterostructures in ref .  .",
    "in spherical quantum - dot heterostructures , namely in spherical qdqws , all effective - mass parameters entering the 8-band hamiltonian depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath7 . therefore , electron and hole states are eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum @xmath8 and its @xmath9-component @xmath10 .",

    "the electron or hole eigenenergy @xmath25 , corresponding to the wave function @xmath23 , does not depend on @xmath26 , because within the spherical approximation the energy spectrum is degenerate with respect to the @xmath9-component of the total momentum .",

    "the functions @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath61 are called further the hole radial components of the wave function because in eqs .",
    "( [ wf ] ) , ( [ envelopes ] ) they are written in front of the vb bloch functions . if the coupling of the conduction and valence bands is not considered , the electron wave function is described by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) ( i.e. by the electron radial component ) , and the hole wave function is described by the second term in eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) ( i.e. by the hole radial components ) .",
    "the inclusion of the coupling between the conduction and valence bands ( which is realized in the 8-band model ) results in the fact that the electron wave function includes the 6-band - hole components ( he ) , in addition to the 2-band - electron component ( ee ) , and the hole wave function includes the 2-band - electron component ( eh ) , in addition to the 6-band - hole components ( hh ) .",
    "the main radial component for the electron wave functions is ee . as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , [ fig:5 ] , the amplitude of he is about 1/2 of ee .",
    "it is also seen , that about 20% of the contribution into the normalization integral comes from he .",
    "such a big contribution from the hole components is because of the strong nonparabolicity of the conduction band in the well materials ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of the electron levels , when going from the one - band model to the 8-band model , is very small .",
    "for example , the level @xmath62 splits into levels @xmath63 and @xmath42 with the distance between them only 0.8  mev for cds / hgs / cds / h@xmath4o qdqw and 3.6  mev for cdte / hgte / cdte / h@xmath4o qdqw",
    ". it should be noted , that this splitting occurs in such way , that the lowest level in the former qdqw is @xmath42 and the lowest level in the latter qdqw is @xmath43 .",
    "the electron ground state energy is not split and it is @xmath41 for both qdqws .",
    "three hh are the main components in the hole wave functions .",
    "the amplitude of eh here is about 1/10 of the amplitudes of hh , and this component gives very small contribution into the normalization integral . comparing with the six - band model , no additional splitting of the hole levels occurs in the 8-band model .",
    "although the hole ground state remains @xmath64 in the cds / hgs / cds / h@xmath4o qdqw , the position of the hole levels changes within this model ( compare with ref .  ) .",
    "the hole ground energy in the cdte / hgte / cdte / h@xmath4o qdqw is @xmath46 .",
    "one can see that the number of electron levels in an arbitrary energy interval is less than the number of hole levels in the same interval .",
    "this is connected with the complex structure of the valence band and with the fact that the hole effective masses are larger than the electron effective mass .",
    "the positions of an electron and a hole differ significantly in the cds / hgs / cds / h@xmath4o qdqw .",
    "while the electron is distributed through the entire dot , the hole is almost completely localized in the hgs layer .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in this qdqw , the electron quantization energy is several times larger than the hole quantization energy .",
    "therefore , while the holes do not practically penetrate into the exterior medium , the probability of the electron presence in h@xmath4o is about 5% . in the cdte / hgte / cdte / h@xmath4o qdqw , the electron and hole behave similarly :",
    "both charge carriers are distributed through the entire dot and the probability of their presence in h@xmath4o is about 5% .",
    "this difference between the considered qdqws can be explained by the fact that the lowest energy levels in the cds / hgs / cds / h@xmath4o qdqw lie inside the hgs well , while the lowest energy levels in the cdte / hgte / cdte / h@xmath4o qdqw lie outside the hgte well ( see figs .  [ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] ) .    finally , taking the cds / hgs / cds / h@xmath0o qdqw as an example",
    ", we examine , first , what error occurs if one uses the symmetrized 8-band hamiltonian to find electron and hole states , and , second , how electron and hole states can change if one supposes that hgs is not a semimetal with @xmath65  mev , but a narrow - gap semiconductor with @xmath66  mev .    the use of the symmetrized 8-band hamiltonian leads to the following changes in the electron and hole spectra as compared to the spectra obtained within our rigorous approach .",
    "( i ) for every value of total angular momentum and parity , there appears one spurious electron level with energy about @xmath67  mev , @xmath68  mev , @xmath69  mev ,   for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath70 , ",
    "electron states , respectively .",
    "these electron states are spurious , because about @xmath71% of the electron density is concentrated in a very narrow region ( less than @xmath72  nm wide ) near the boundary between the qdqw and water .",
    "( ii ) at the same time , the energy of the lowest genuine electron levels increases by @xmath73  mev , @xmath74  mev , @xmath75  mev ,   for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath70 , ",
    "electron states , respectively .",
    "since all other electron states must be orthogonal to the lowest  spurious   state , a considerable part of the low - lying electron states possess a high probability ( of about @xmath76 that the electron is in water .",
    "( iii ) the energy of hole states changes only slightly ( by @xmath77  mev ) .",
    "the density of the lowest hole states is also slightly modified .",
    "the increase of the value @xmath78(hgs ) from @xmath79  mev to @xmath80  mev , while all other parameters are kept unchanged , results in the following .",
    "( i ) the energy of all the lowest electron levels increases by about @xmath81  mev .",
    "this fact leads to a decrease of the electron density in the hgs well and to a corresponding increase of the electron density in the cds layers .",
    "( ii ) the energy of hole levels changes weakly ( by less than @xmath82  mev ) , and the distribution of the hole density is practically unchanged .",
    "a spherical qdqw structure is considered for the first time within the 8-band model .",
    "this approach generalizes the one - band and the six - band models , which have been used for qdqws so far , and exactly takes into account the nonparabolicity of the electron dispersion law . electron and hole energy spectra and the corresponding wave functions for typical qdqws have been examined . while in the cds / hgs / cds / h@xmath4o qdqw ( recently considered in the framework of the 6-band model@xcite ) holes in the lowest states are strongly localized in the well region , in the cdte / hgte / cdte / h@xmath4o qdqw holes are shown to be distributed through the entire dot . at the same time , electrons in both types of qdqws are not localized in the quantum well .",
    "the lowest optically active electron - hole pair state in both qdqws is @xmath83-@xmath46 .",
    "the energy of this state is 2.022  ev for the cds / hgs / cds / h@xmath4o qdqw and 1.723  ev for the cdte / hgte / cdte / h@xmath4o qdqw .",
    "the inclusion of the exciton effect reduces each of these energies by about 100  mev and makes them close to the experimental values given in refs .",
    "( the analysis of this effect is in progress ) .",
    "the aforementioned conclusions about the properties of the electron and hole spectra are a consequence of 1 monolayer thickness of the hgs ( hgte ) well and of the semimetal character of the well material .",
    "we have made it certain that the symmetrized 8-band model is not capable to describe electronic states in qdqws composed of materials with very dissimilar band parameters .",
    "it has been also shown that the obtained results do not depend critically on the actual value of the well band gap . in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that the developed model is an effective tool to analyze quantum - dot heterostructures , which include thin well layers and also narrow - band - gap materials .",
