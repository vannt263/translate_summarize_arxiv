    "at low energies the interaction between quarks and gluons is extremely strong and leads to confinement , where approximate qcd solutions can be obtained by an effective field theory known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) or chiral dynamics@xcite .",
    "this is based on the chiral symmetry present in the qcd lagrangian in the limit of massless light quarks , but which is broken in the ground state of matter .",
    "in such a situation , goldstone s theorem states that there are massless , pseudoscalar bosons whose interactions with other hadrons vanish at zero momentum@xcite . in the case of m@xmath0=m@xmath1=0 , there are three goldstone bosons which are identified as the pion triplet .",
    "the relatively weak interactions of goldstone bosons at low energies invites a perturbation scheme based on chiral symmetry and hadronic degrees of freedom .    in the real world , the light quark masses are nonzero , but small @xcite .",
    "therefore , for strong interaction theory to have predictive power , calculations must be performed taking the deviations from the pure goldstone theorem into account . as an example",
    ", the s wave scattering length , @xmath2 , vanishes for a goldstone boson scattering from any hadron in the low energy limit .",
    "however for a physical meson with finite mass ( @xmath3 ) one would intuitively expect @xmath4 ( see contribution of a.b . in ref.@xcite ) where @xmath5 is the chiral symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath6 for pions , where @xmath7 is the decay constant ) .",
    "this intuitive expectation is supported by the original calculation of weinberg @xcite in which the scattering lengths of pions from any hadrons were first obtained by current algebra techniques ( a precursor of chpt ) .",
    "the order of magnitude of the s wave scattering lengths is@xcite : @xmath8 one observes that @xmath9 when @xmath10 ( the chiral limit ) and also that @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , one would expect the production and decay amplitudes of goldstone bosons to vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "some examples , which can be obtained from chpt calculations @xcite , are the threshold electric dipole amplitude , @xmath12 for s wave photo - pion production , the @xmath13 term of @xmath14 scattering , the isospin breaking @xmath15 decay , and the form factors for @xmath16 decays in a similar vein , there are some observables that diverge in the chiral limit , such as the charge radii and polarizabilities of nucleons and pions @xcite . in this case , the physical interpretation is that the meson cloud extends beyond the hadron and in the chiral limit extends to infinity .",
    "pion - hadron scattering and the amplitudes given above are examples of quantities that either vanish or blow up in the chiral limit . in the real world , where the light quark masses are non - zero , chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and these quantities are finite and non - zero .",
    "their precise ( nonzero and finite ) values are measures of explicit chiral symmetry breaking , and therefore a theoretical challenge to calculate them .",
    "quantities which either vanish or diverge in the chiral limit point to an experimental opportunity to perform precise experiments , not only to check chpt calculations , but also as fundamental quantities which must be predicted by any theory of the strong interaction .",
    "experimental chiral dynamics is the study of the properties , production and decay amplitudes , and low energy interactions of the almost goldstone bosons ( @xmath3 ) with themselves and with other hadrons .",
    "the main purpose of this contribution is to point out new and exciting experimental possibilities in chiral dynamics which arise by having an experimental apparatus with thin , pure , polarized , targets in an electron storage ring with an intense , polarized , electron beam of @xmath17 1 gev .",
    "we will introduce the possibility of a new very small angle electron scattering / almost  real photon tagging facility ( smash ) which will utilize the polarized , internal targets being built for blast . as important examples we shall discuss the threshold @xmath18 and polarized compton scattering , @xmath19 , reactions .",
    "furthermore , such a facility would be capable of measuring all photo - hadron processes with polarized photons on polarized and unpolarized internal targets , e.g. protons , deuterons , and @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , the coherent @xmath21 reaction can be accessed from threshold through the @xmath22 region and could produce important new results on the @xmath23 amplitude . some of these experiments require soft recoil ion detection near the internal target .",
    "we will also point out the possibility of using the blast detector itself in addition to the internal target to investigate other timely physics issues e.g. to study the quadrupole components in the @xmath24 transition .",
    "near threshold pion photoproduction is an excellent example of confinement scale qcd physics , where considerable theoretical and experimental progress has been made in the past few years . starting with the availability of cw electron beams ,",
    "the @xmath25 reaction has been performed with high quality tagged photon beams at mainz@xcite and saskatoon@xcite . at the same time , chpt calculations have been performed which have advanced our understanding of this reaction@xcite . for the sake of brevity",
    "only the photoproduction experiments will be discussed here .",
    "chpt is an effective field theory which uses the observed hadrons rather then the quarks and gluons as the degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangians are organized into a series of increasing powers of the momenta , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the chiral scale parameter .",
    "the introduction of a higher order lagrangian introduces low energy constants which are required to renormalize the infinities order by order . at the present time",
    "these low energy constants must be determined empirically by fits to data or estimated by the principle of resonance saturation . in principle",
    "they can be obtained from the qcd lagrangian by integrating out the high energy degrees of freedom , e.g. by lattice gauge theory .",
    "the importance of chpt is that it is an effective _ theory _ based on qcd , i.e. at each order in the momentum expansion , the diagrams that must be calculated are specified and not left to individual discretion as they are in model calculations .    at the present time",
    "one loop chpt calculations for electromagnetic pion production have been carried out to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the presence of the counterterms implies 3 low energy constants in photoproduction and 5 in electroproduction : two in the transverse s wave multipole @xmath29 , one in the p wave transverse multipoles , and two in the longitudinal s wave multipole @xmath30 ( for electroproduction ) .",
    "currently , these are determined by a fit to the data and also estimated by the principle of resonance saturation .",
    "the two approaches are found to agree @xcite , indicating that the values are understood .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath31 photo and electroproduction from the neutron can be predicted without any additional parameters .",
    "thus measurements of the neutron production amplitudes will provide a stringent test of chpt calculations .",
    "one important advantage that chpt has brought to the study of electromagnetic meson production is the systematic ordering of the diagrams . in particular",
    ", pion rescattering in the final state ( 1 loop diagram ) is the crucial ingredient of the near threshold energy dependence .",
    "the largest contribution comes from the production of charged pions in the intermediate state .",
    "since the ratio of the electric dipole amplitudes for the neutral and charged pion channels @xmath32 , the two step @xmath33 reaction is as strong as the direct @xmath25 path . combined with the separation of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 thresholds this leads to a unitary cusp in the @xmath25 reaction .    the simplest example to understand the occurrence of the unitary cusp in the @xmath36 reaction ( where @xmath37 is a real or virtual photon ) is to use the 3 channel s matrix for the open channels ( @xmath38 , @xmath35 ) @xcite . applying the constraints of unitary and time reversal invariance , one",
    "is led to the coupled channel result for the s wave amplitude @xmath39 : @xmath40   \\label{eqn : e0+_unitary}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the s wave @xmath34 phase shift ( predicted to be very small ) , a(k ) is a smooth function of the photon energy k , @xmath42 is the cusp parameter , and @xmath43 is the @xmath44 cms momentum which is continued below the @xmath35 threshold as @xmath45 .",
    "the cusp function @xmath46 contributes to the real ( imaginary ) part of @xmath29 below ( above ) the @xmath35 threshold .",
    "the results for the real part of the s wave electric dipole amplitude @xmath47 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ree0 + ] . the rapid energy dependence between the @xmath34 and @xmath35 thresholds at 144.7 and 151.4 mev due to the unitary cusp can be seen . above the @xmath35 threshold",
    "the energy dependence is much less rapid .",
    "this is in approximate agreement with the predictions of the unitary cusp ( eq.[eqn : e0+_unitary],ref.@xcite ) and chpt@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the errors in the data shown in fig.[fig : ree0 + ] are statistical only so that the disagreement between the data sets is not serious . to complete the observation of the unitary cusp and to precisely measure the value of @xmath48 , @xmath49 must be measured .",
    "in particular , experiments with polarized targets can measure the predicted rapid rise in @xmath50 above the @xmath35 threshold .",
    "the smash facility outlined here would provide such important data .",
    "the unitary constraints to the multipole amplitudes show the importance of the final state @xmath51 scattering and charge exchange on the @xmath52 reaction .",
    "it raises the possibility of measuring @xmath53 and @xmath54 by measurements of @xmath55 both below and above the @xmath35 threshold@xcite . the s wave @xmath56 elastic scattering and charge exchange scattering length have been of considerable interest since weinberg@xcite predicted that there should be an isospin breaking effect due to the up , down quark mass difference . for @xmath57",
    "this effect is @xmath17 30% , in large part because the isospin conserving term in @xmath57 is very small ( @xmath58 ) and consequently very difficult to measure .",
    "since the charge exchange scattering length is much larger ( @xmath59 ) this is easier to observe . here",
    "the isospin violating term due to the up and down quark mass effect is the same ( within a factor of @xmath60 ) of the elastic scattering prediction but in relative terms is @xmath17 2 to 3% of the isospin conserving term .",
    "the most straightforward way to observe this predicted isospin violation is to measure the cusp parameter @xmath48 in the @xmath61 reaction with polarized proton targets@xcite and also @xmath29 in the @xmath62 reaction",
    ". then one could compare the values of @xmath63 with the measured value of @xmath64 from the line width in pionic hydrogen@xcite .",
    "if isospin is a good quantum number then these will be equal and opposite .",
    "equivalently , the dynamic isospin breaking effect of the up , down quark masses can be considered as an isospin breaking contribution to @xmath48 of @xmath17 2 to 3% @xcite .",
    "in addition to the s wave multipole @xmath29 discussed above , chpt makes predictions for the threshold magnitudes of the three p wave multipoles ( @xmath65)@xcite . since the p wave @xmath51 phase shifts are small at low energies , the p wave multipoles are essentially real .",
    "therefore for each threshold @xmath66 reaction there are five multipole amplitudes to be measured ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the unpolarized cross section can be written as @xmath68 where a , b , and c are real bilinear combinations of the five multipole amplitudes@xcite .",
    "a complete experimental determination of the multipoles requires then two additional polarization measurements .",
    "this could include , e.g. measurements with linear polarized photons and unpolarized targets and with polarized targets and unpolarized photons ( this latter response measures imaginary parts of interference amplitudes@xcite ) .",
    "measurements with both photon and target polarization could also be used@xcite .",
    "there are three independent isospin amplitudes and four reaction channels ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "so a measurement of all four constitutes a test of isospin conservation .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive set of measurements of the threshold photo - pion reactions requires experiments with polarized photons and targets , including both neutron and proton targets .",
    "unpolarized experiments on the threshold @xmath25 reaction have been performed @xcite .",
    "the results for the s wave multipole @xmath29 were discussed above .",
    "in addition , two linear combinations of the three p wave multipoles were found to be in agreement with chpt calculations @xcite .",
    "more recently we have performed a threshold @xmath18 experiment at mainz with linearly polarized photons and the data are presently being analyzed .",
    "this will complete the measurement of the three p wave multipoles for @xmath31 photoproduction from the proton .",
    "however at the present time , there are no measurements of @xmath49 , which requires polarized target experiments such as can be performed at smash .",
    "there is also growing interest in using the deuteron as a neutron target for the @xmath70 amplitudes .",
    "a chpt calculation for the coherent @xmath71 reaction exactly at threshold has been performed@xcite , as was a first experiment of the @xmath72 reaction ( where x = d or np ) at saskatoon @xcite .",
    "most @xmath31 spectrometers , including the one deployed at saskatoon , do not have sufficient energy resolution to determine whether this reaction was coherent ( x = d ) or not ( x = np ) . for the saskatoon experiment the smaller incoherent cross section was calculated with a model and subtracted from the data to produce a coherent cross section to compare with theory @xcite .",
    "+   +    [ fig : raytrace ]    in general studies of the coherent @xmath71 reaction are best performed with recoil deuteron detection .",
    "this is an important opportunity for polarized internal targets which are thin and allow the detection of low energy recoil deuterons .",
    "there are also opportunities in the @xmath22 region .",
    "there an interesting sensitivity to the quadrupole e2 amplitude has been theoretically demonstrated for polarized deuteron targets @xcite ( see also fig.[fig : wilhelm ] ) .",
    "this sensitivity is for small @xmath31 cms angles for which the recoil deuteron energy is small .    although space does not permit a detailed discussion of compton scattering , a few remarks about its significance is in order .",
    "previous measurements have aimed to determine the electric and magnetic polarizability of the proton . however , the spin dependent polarizabilities have yet to be measured .",
    "these spin dependent polarizabilities are subtle probes of the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "this requires compton scattering of polarized photons from polarized targets .",
    "the use of polarized internal targets is an excellent way to make these measurements , particularly since these targets are thin and one can measure the recoil nuclei as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we discuss the technique of very small angle electron scattering , or almost  real photon tagging , with a specific conceptual implementation for the bates storage ring , and some ideas for important possible experiments .",
    "much of this material has been presented in an unpublished report from a previous incarnation of this concept proposed at bates several years ago @xcite .",
    "this previous project was conceived before blast was funded , and therefore was presented as a stand  alone",
    "facility with a different proposed position in the bates ring . with the advent of blast funding ,",
    "the new idea is to employ the blast polarized target , and to make modifications to the ring to accommodate a very small angle electron tagger .",
    "the method of very small angle electron scattering has been known for many years ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) and is based on the fact that the virtual photons have very low @xmath73 , so can be treated as almost  real photons . what is new about the present proposal is the utilization of full polarization observables for both the photon and the target , which is made possible by detecting these very small angle scattered electrons , thereby _ tagging _ the almost  real exchange photons.the target polarization is made possible by the use of internal targets . for the photon , one obtains circular polarization from longitudinally polarized electrons . the equivalent response function for linear polarized",
    "real photons @xcite are obtained by measuring the @xmath74 dependence of the cross section@xcite .",
    "therefore , this virtual tagging proposal goes much further in utilizing the polarized , pure , and windowless nature of internal targets , and the very large linear polarization of the almost  real photons .      a method to perform very small angle electron scattering / almost  real photon tagging in the bates storage ring",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : chicane ] . at this stage",
    "the design is conceptual only , but it does exhibit the main features of what a fully designed facility would have . the point here is to introduce the idea and its possibilities to motivate further study .    the design is based on the introduction of a chicane downstream of the internal target position , beginning just outside the blast superstructure .",
    "a crucial element in the chicane design is that the extra path length introduced must be @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the beam wavelength fixed by the rf . in this conceptual design @xmath77 .",
    "another important element is for the optics from the chicane to the next ring dipole to be identical to the unmodified ring .",
    "the chicane shown in fig.[fig : chicane ] does not satisfy this , but preliminary ring optics investigations by t. zwart of bates @xcite using box ( not sector ) dipoles without the quadrupoles in between show that in principle this should be possible with relatively minor adjustments of local beam line elements .",
    "a full study of this issue could not be completed in time for this article , but nevertheless , one does not expect that the properties of the fully designed chicane / tagger will be significantly different from what is to be described .    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     for a final example , consider the coherent @xmath78 reaction on a vector polarized deuteron target which has been shown ( see @xcite ) to be sensitive to the nucleon quadrupole e2 amplitude .",
    "figure [ fig : wilhelm ] demonstrates the calculated sensitivity , which is greatest at small pion cms angles where the recoil deuteron energy is low .",
    "again the proposed blast low energy recoil detector would be used to detect these deuterons .",
    "the neutral pions would be detected with the same setup used for the threshold photoproduction and compton scattering experiments .",
    "once again the merits of a thin windowless internal target is seen .",
    "the experiments presented in the previous section are but a few examples of what can done to exploit the unique capability of an almost - real photon tagger coupled with the proposed blast facility @xcite . including also a new forward hadron detector and",
    "a large acceptance photon detector would not only allow three important chiral dynamics experiments to be done , but should also open up a whole new arena of unique experiments .",
    "the low energy qcd experiments include : threshold photo-@xmath31 production on polarized protons to measure @xmath79 which is sensitive to the isospin breaking due to the light quark mass differences , fully polarized compton scattering , which measures the internal quark helicity structure , and the electric quadrupole contribution to the @xmath80 transitions in the proton and the deuteron .",
    "other reactions not touched on here include photo nucleon and photo pion production from polarized few body nuclei .",
    "we believe that this opens a new and exciting window of opportunity for polarized , internal , targets at bates .",
    "more detailed design efforts are currently underway , and more input from the collaboration in general would be warmly welcomed .",
