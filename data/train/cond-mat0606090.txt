    "recent theoretical attention has centered on the structure of the phase diagram,@xcite on the existence of spontaneous flux lattices,@xcite and on the question of spin - triplet versus spin - singlet superconductivity.@xcite    in contrast , less is known about the properties of superconductors on the paramagnetic side of , but close to , a ferromagnetic instability .",
    "we will refer to `` paramagnetic superconductors '' to describe systems in this regime , although the superconductivity of course leads to the usual strong diamagnetic effects .",
    "such paramagnetic superconductors include systems below the superconducting transition temperature , but above the temperature below which coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism occurs , as well as systems that never develop ferromagnetism , but are close to a ferromagnetic instability in some direction in parameter space other than temperature .",
    "an example of the latter is believed to be the non - oxide perovskite mgcni@xmath2 , which superconducts below a critical temperature @xmath3.@xcite there is no evidence for a ferromagnetic phase in this material , but it has been suggested that a ferromagnetic ground state can be reached upon a relatively small amount of hole doping.@xcite this system may thus be close to a ferromagnetic instability everywhere in its superconducting phase",

    "the authors of ref . have ruled out morphological effects as an explanation , which raises the question whether proximity to a ferromagnetic state may be responsible . indeed , since ferromagnetic fluctuations are expected to weaken ( singlet ) superconductivity , this is a plausible suggestion for the origin of the weaker - than - expected temperature dependence of @xmath5 .",
    "the probable proximity to ferromagnetism has led to a debate about the nature and symmetry of the pairing in mgcni@xmath2.@xcite this point has not been settled ; some experimental evidence points to conventional s - wave pairing ; other , to a superconducting order parameter with nodes .",
    "the nature of the pairing in the other materials mentioned above has not been unambiguously determined either . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the behavior close to @xmath6 , which is qualitatively independent of the symmetry of the order parameter and thus expected to be the same for all nearly ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "we use a generalized ginzburg - landau theory to theoretically investigate the electrodynamic properties of a superconductor as a ferromagnetic instability is approached .",
    "we treat the superconductivity in the usual mean - field approximation , but the magnetic critical behavior exactly in a scaling sense .",
    "somewhat counter - intuitively , strong magnetic fluctuations make , in a well - defined sense , the superconductivity more robust in certain respects . in particular , the penetration depth becomes anomalously short .",
    "the thermodynamic critical field , on the other hand , becomes weaker , as one might intuitively expect .",
    "the temperature dependencies of the critical field @xmath10 and the penetration depth @xmath11 depend on the magnetic critical exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . for the critical current @xmath14 , this results in an exponent @xmath15 between 1.5 ( the ginzburg - landau result ) and 2.16 in various temperature regimes .",
