    "extended rpa theories such as second rpa ( srpa )  @xcite , which go beyond first - order rpa , are often used to describe the strength , decay width and fine structure of nuclear giant resonances ( grs ) and other collective low - lying states .",
    "they also appear particularly useful in the case of unitarily transformed realistic interactions , which have not been calibrated for first - order rpa methods , but rather rely on extended model spaces to provide converged results",
    ". such interactions also make  self - consistent \" extended - rpa applications possible , in the sense that the ground state and the residual couplings can be described by the same hamiltonian .",
    "first applications using a renormalized argonne v18 potential , derived with the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom )  @xcite , were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "self - consistent extended - rpa applications in large spaces without arbitrary truncations can be envisioned , in principle , with any properly constructed finite - range effective interaction .",
    "however , they are hardly ever performed for various technical and conceptual reasons .",
    "phenomenological effective interactions are fitted to sets of experimental data using mostly hartree - fock(-bogoliubov ) and selected ( quasi - particle ) rpa results .",
    "their range of applicability is then restricted to the selected observables and many - body methods .",
    "zero - range effective interactions , which greatly simplify numerical applications , can not be employed in second - order rpa methods , because they do not provide a natural cutoff in momentum space .",
    "consequently , no effective interactions have been fitted to calculations beyond first - order rpa and consistency in the treatment of the ground and excited states is ordinarily abandoned in practical applications of such methods .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to perform and analyze large - scale ( i.e. , without arbitrary truncations ) ,  self - consistent \" ( i.e. , with a single interaction as the sole input ) srpa calculations .",
    "we employ mostly the @xmath0 interaction used in ref .",
    "it is derived from the argonne v18 potential by means of a unitary transformation , which renormalizes it , while preserving the phase shifts and retaining the complex structure of the realistic interaction .",

    "no explicit three - body force is used at this point .",
    "we will not focus on producing realistic results and comparing them with data , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but rather on technical and physical aspects of the method .",

    "the approximation remains quite good for heavier nuclei , for example @xmath200ca , whose isq response is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : full]a , calculated within a space of 9 shells .",
    "we expect the diagonal approximation to be reliable for soft , perturbative interactions in general .",
    "the additional couplings within the @xmath10 space , ignored in the diagonal approximation , constitute higher - order corrections to the excitation propagator with respect to the interaction , as can be demonstrated diagrammatically  @xcite .",
    "results with the brink - boeker potential , @xmath1 , corroborate this speculation .",
    "@xmath1 is even softer than the @xmath0 .",
    "for example , it produces much smaller second - order corrections to the nuclear binding energies in the perturbation expansion beyond hartree - fock  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f : full]b we show the ivd response of @xmath197o calculated using @xmath1 .",
    "the diagonal approximation is very good in this case .    to be on the safe side , it is always advisable to verify the quality of the approximation within some tractable space . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , it was found that it is quite bad in the case of metallic clusters when the bare coulomb interaction is used .    from fig .",
    "[ f : toy]a we deduced that the srpa and srpa0 solutions yield almost the same results for the giant resonance .",
    "however , when we look at the strength distribution on a logarithmic scale , fig .  [",
    "f : toy]b , it becomes obvious that the two solutions give different results for the majority of eigenstates , which are mostly of @xmath10 character .",
    "one implication is that the diagonal approximation can not be relied upon when examining , e.g. , double giant resonances and the response function of two - particle operators in general . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ f : ddr ] we plot the strength function of the @xmath27 component of the double dipole resonance .",
    "we notice that the srpa0 strength function is very close to the unperturbed one ( hf ) and differs significantly from the srpa result .    in fig .",
    "[ f : eigen05 ] we show the density of eigenstates ( number of states per 5  mev excitation energy ) when solving the srpa problem with and without the diagonal approximation , as well as the density of unperturbed @xmath9 and @xmath10 states ( hf ) .",
    "one immediately notices that for the most part the srpa0 density of states is very similar to the unperturbed one .    finally , below about 40  mev , where the giant resonance lies , the srpa and srpa0 densities practically coincide .",
    "this is not surprising , given the very small number of eigenstates present there , but it is not always the case .",
    "we note , for example , that in the case of the @xmath201 response of @xmath200ca , where there are several unperturbed @xmath10 states at low energies , the srpa0 density of states follows mostly the hf one in that energy region .",
    "the single - particle strength functions , however , are almost identical ( fig .",
    "[ f : full]a ) and the diagonal approximation remains well justified .      in figs .",
    "[ f : toy ] and [ f : full ] we notice that the gr lies lower in srpa(0 ) than in rpa .",

    "it is a general feature of the coupling to @xmath10 excitations  @xcite ( and not particular to nuclei  @xcite ) , and shows why traditional effective interactions can not be used in srpa .",
    "the self - energy corrections responsible for the modification of the @xmath9 energies and the lowering of the resonance energies ( see also sec .  [",
    "s : fragm ] ) are already parameterized in the interaction , so that realistic results are obtained already at the rpa level .",
    "employing such an interaction in srpa will result in double counting of those effects .",
    "ths problem is circumvented in practical applications in the literature through the use of realistic single - particle energies and subtracting procedures , which remove the real part of the self energy , responsible for the shift .      as a microscopic theory of collisional damping ,",
    "srpa has been used extensively to describe the spreading width and strength fragmentation and quenching of collective excitations .",
    "let us examine our results in this context .",
    "no spreading width is observed in fig .",
    "[ f : toy]a , as there are no configurations available in the vicinity of the resonance .",
    "but when we look at fig .",
    "[ f : toy]b , we realize that there is practically a continuum of weak srpa or srpa0 eigenstates ( @xmath202 ) extending to high energies .",
    "most are predominantly of @xmath10 nature and their contribution to the single - particle strength is rather small .",
    "nevertheless , they carry a non - negligible percentage of the total strength and provide a mechanism of strength quenching for the giant resonance ( by contrast , there are only @xmath198 rpa eigenstates ) .",
    "we note , in particular , that : ( i ) as expected , the total energy - weighted strength @xmath99 is found to be practically the same in all three cases ( rpa , srpa0 , srpa ) , and the total strength @xmath98 is found just about @xmath203 larger in srpa or srpa0 than in rpa , but ( ii ) the strongest ism peak appears at 21.36  mev in the case of rpa , 16.50  mev in srpa0 , and 16.25  mev in srpa and ( iii ) the six lowest eigenstates carry a total strength of 313.4  @xmath204 in rpa , which is almost all the rpa strength ( they lie at 21 to 47  mev excitation energy ) , 304.5  @xmath204 in srpa0 ( 16 to 34  mev ) and 304.0  @xmath204 in srpa ( 16 to 34  mev ) , i.e. , about @xmath203 less in srpa(0 ) than in rpa ; finally , ( iv ) the width of the ism strength functions below 40  mev is 3.86  mev in rpa and 3.73  mev in srpa , while the widths over the whole spectrum are 4.65 and 18.94  mev respectively .",
    "the coupling with @xmath10 configurations affects not only the collective excitations , but at the same time the single - particle states . within the present formalism",
    "one can demonstrate this through the strength of the @xmath9 configurations . in fig .",

    "a second cluster of states is visible around 60  mev roughly corresponding to @xmath208 configurations , and so on . in srpa",
    "the strength distribution appears even more fragmented , as well as shifted to lower energies .",
    "the shift reflects an effective compression of the single - particle spectrum ( a modification of the nucleon effective mass ) , with respect to hf , and leads to the downward shift of the collective states , discussed above .",
    "although we can visually identify the different shells contributing to the strength distribution , and observe an energetic shift , the total @xmath98 and @xmath99  and thus the centroid  of any given @xmath9 configuration is the same in rpa and srpa . nevertheless ,",
    "in rpa we find only 1% of the @xmath207 @xmath98 strength above 40  mev .",
    "in srpa the strength in the same region is 14% .",
    "when we look at the distributions in logarithmic scale , fig .",
    "[ f : phfraglog ] , we realize that the @xmath9 strength distributions span the whole space available , reflecting the extended spectroscopic functions of the particle and hole states .      as is obvious from figs .",
    "[ f : toy ] and [ f : eigen05 ] , the majority of basis states ( unperturbed @xmath9 and @xmath10 states ) lies at high energies relative to the giant resonance .",
    "figure  [ f : eph2max ] ( see caption for details ) illustrates what would happen if we truncated the model space by setting an upper cutoff @xmath209 to the @xmath10 energies taken into account .",
    "had we set , e.g. , @xmath210  mev , we would have excluded 75% of the configurations available in this particular space and the eigenenergies would have been at least 2  mev higher than their converged ( with respect to @xmath209 ) values .",
    "inclusion of the energetically lowest 50% of configurations would still not warrant good convergence .",
    "we found that the convergence of the eigenenergies and the saturation of the model space follow the same pattern as demonstrated in fig .",

    ". it would be computationally economical to neglect those elements .",
    "we found , however , that such a procedure influences the position of the resonances as well as the shape of the strength distribution and can not be blindly trusted .",
    "the self - consistent rpa that we have used produces a spurious state at practically zero energy , and leaves the rest of the spectrum uncontaminated  @xcite , as expected .",
    "the srpa dipole spectrum , however , may contain spurious admixture , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : cons1 ] . in order to quantify this problem ,",

    "it may also appear fragmented , as spurious admixtures enter the rest of the spectrum , or as additional eigenstates occur in its proximity .    as anticipated in sec .",
    "[ s : cons1 ] , another problem with the hf - based srpa is the onset of instabilities .",
    "we find , in particular , that low - lying states ( @xmath213 @xmath201 states and the collective @xmath214 excitation ) appear at imaginary or negative energies .",

    "we have thus concluded that srpa can be applied in the giant - resonance region with reasonable confidence .",
    "srpa is primarily the theory of collisional damping .",
    "a more comprehensive method to study nuclear collective states should consider also coupling to collective low - lying phonons  @xcite .",
    "it is not easy to tell at this point how strongly those could enhance or ( partly ) cancel the effect of coupling to the large amount of @xmath10 states considered in srpa . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the resonance shifts due to the @xmath10 states are stronger than those due to collective phonons , although both mechanisms are expected to contribute to the damping width .",
    "notwithstanding some particular shortcomings of the present srpa formalism , this work paves the way for systematic studies of giant resonances using finite - range interactions and extended rpa theories without adjustable parameters and arbitrary truncations of the model space .",
    "discussions with vladimir ponomarev and jochen wambach are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through sfb 634 , by the helmholtz international center for fair within the framework of the loewe program launched by the state of hesse , and by the bmbf verbundforschung ( contract 06da90401 ) ."
