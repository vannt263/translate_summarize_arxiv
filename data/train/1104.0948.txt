    "the chemistry of protoplanetary disks plays a pivotal role in the development of planetary systems , of habitable planets , and of life .",
    "however , our understanding of the chemical conditions in protoplanetary disks  especially in planet forming regions  is far from complete . in particular",
    ", there are many uncertainties about the role of volatiles such as water , which not only play a crucial role in life as we know it , but also in many other processes that affect the formation and evolution of planets .",
    "for example , the location of water - ice sublimation , the so - called ice line , may define a boundary within which planetary cores do not grow large enough to become gas giants . and",
    ", molecular ices make up the bulk of many outer solar system bodies , including kuiper belt objects and outer - planet satellites .    for many years , the detection of water in protoplanetary disks remained elusive , with only a few definitive examples of ice @xcite and vapor @xcite detections .",
    "additionally , organic molecules were detected in absorption through an edge - on disk @xcite .",
    "recently , however , @xcite and @xcite reported detections of a forest of emission lines of h@xmath0o , oh , hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0  and co@xmath0 in high - resolution spectra from the spitzer space telescope infrared spectrograph ( irs ) , as well as of vibrational h@xmath0o  lines with the keck near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ) .",
    "based on emitting temperatures , fluxes and line shapes , these lines appeared to originate in the disk atmospheres at terrestrial - planet - forming radii . additionally , when present , the mid - ir water lines likely dominate the cooling of the inner disk surface layer @xcite .",
    "the frequent detections of water and other molecules in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks , made possible largely by optimized high dynamic range observing strategies and data reduction routines @xcite , mark a turning point in our ability to study chemical evolution and molecular transport in the inner solar system . because chemistry and line excitation are linked to disk physics , molecular emission",
    "can be used to study disk structure and physics .",
    "for example , water is destroyed by photodissociation and by high levels of ionization ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , but is capable of self - shielding in certain conditions @xcite , and so water abundances may reflect the disk irradiation environment . because water condenses at relatively small radii in the disk midplane ( @xmath7 a few au for solar - mass stars ) , water vapor may be driven outward by vapor pressure differences , while water ice is carried inwards by planetesimals .",
    "hence , water abundances may also reflect radial transport and planet formation timescales .",
    "water abundances may similarly depend on vertical transport , which , when coupled with midplane condensation , could deplete water even well inside the canonical snow line @xcite .",
    "finally , the strength of molecular emission lines depends upon the disk structure as a whole , including the gas temperature structure and the degree of dust settling / grain growth .",
    "one way to disentangle the many factors that affect molecular abundances and line strengths is to observe a large sample of disks , and look for trends predicted by the processes described above .",
    "here we report characteristics of a sample of disks observed with the spitzer space telescope infrared spectrograph ( irs ) , first described and presented in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) . in paper",
    "i , we presented the overall characteristics of the spectra , including molecular detection rates , and reported a strong dependence of molecular emission on spectral type . in this paper , we analyze the irs spectra in more detail , reporting correlations of line strengths and detections with system parameters , as well as molecular ratios calculated from lte slab models . in addition , we use observations of co rovibrational emission at 5 @xmath1 m ( g.a .",
    "blake et al . , in prep ) , to estimate molecular ratios with respect to co. as one of the most abundant and easily - detected molecules in disks , co is a tracer of the bulk of the disk gas , and provides a good baseline for comparing molecular abundances .",
    "m - band ( @xmath75@xmath1 m ) co rovibrational lines have similar excitation energies and collisional rates as the rotational h@xmath0o  lines observed with the irs , making these transitions particularly suited for comparison with the irs observations .",
    "the mid - ir data in this study were all obtained with the spitzer infrared spectrograph ( irs ) in its high - resolution mode .",
    "the observed sample derives from a high s / n program designed for the detection of water and other molecular emission ( pid 50641 ; pi j. carr ) , as well as from a few programs in the spitzer archive , and is described in detail in paper i. a description of the observations , including program ids , integration times and astronomical observation request ( aor ) numbers , can also be found in paper i.    a brief explanation of the data reduction procedure is as follows .",
    "all data were reduced with our own idl routines , along with the irsfringe package @xcite , using a procedure similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "we began with irs droop - corrected , non - flat - fielded basic calibrated data ( bcd ) from the spitzer science center irs pipeline . in order to reduce noise caused by edge - effects , pipeline flat - fields",
    "were first divided by a low - order polynomial fit in the spectral and spatial directions .",
    "an off - frame was subtracted , data were flat - fielded , and noisy and bad pixels removed .",
    "spectra were divided by an average of at least five standard stars , and minimally processed with the irsfringe package .",
    "a more complete description of the reduction procedure can be found in paper i.    as reported in paper i , the observed irs spectra contain a forest of molecular emission lines from h@xmath0o , oh , hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0 and co@xmath0 .",
    "for the analyses in paper i and this work , positive detections require a 3.5@xmath8 peak ( at two line locations for h@xmath0o  and oh ) , with some line detections included or excluded through individual by - eye examination .",
    "fluxes are calculated by defining and subtracting a linear fit to the local continuum , then summing over the expected width of the line , except for the water emission lines , which are fit with gaussians , as described in paper i. wavelength regions used are as follows : oh ( 23.00923.308 and 27.30827.764 @xmath1 m ) , hcn ( 13.83714.075 @xmath1 m ) , c@xmath0h@xmath0 ( 13.55313.764 @xmath1 m ) and co@xmath0 ( 14.84715.014 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "all features overlap to some extent with h@xmath0o  emission , with flux contributions from water as high as @xmath9% in the hcn and c@xmath0h@xmath0 regions , and even higher near the co@xmath0 q - branch .",
    "thus , an h@xmath0o  emission model ( described in ",
    "[ sec : lte ] ) was subtracted before molecular line fluxes were computed .",
    "nevertheless , this subtraction does not have a significant effect on the statistical analyses we present .",
    "statistical errors on individual points in the spectrum are calculated as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of frames used to calculate the flux , and @xmath8 is the standard deviation of the values in that pixel . if @xmath12 , then the error is taken to be the standard deviation computed using three neighboring pixels in the dispersion direction .",
    "systematic uncertainties are undoubtedly larger , especially for frames without dedicated background observations , but can be difficult to characterize .",
    "line flux errors are taken to be the root squared sum of errors on individual points over the wavelength range used to compute the line flux .",
    "upper limits are calculated assuming a 3.5@xmath8 line height ( see paper i for a discussion of this choice ) , and a feature shape defined by an lte slab model , with column density , @xmath11 , and temperature , @xmath13 , taken to be near the mean of those derived in ",
    "[ sec : lte ] . however , upper limits are not very sensitive to the model parameters .",
    "calculated fluxes and upper limits for all molecules except for water are shown in tables [ table : fluxes ] and [ table : fluxes_haebe ] .",
    "detections and water fluxes can be found in paper i.    we also compute the flux in the 12.514 @xmath1 m interval ( f@xmath14 ) and the 13/30 @xmath1 m sed slope ( @xmath15 ) , which are shown in tables [ table : star_refs ] and [ table : herbig ] .",
    "precise definitions of these parameters can be found in @xcite .",
    "statistical errors are small ; however , note that the variation in flux over the 12.514 @xmath1 m interval can be large ( as much as several jy ) , and that systematic errors can arise from background subtraction and the computation of the spectral response function .",

    "ns +      m - band ( @xmath75 @xmath1 m ) spectra of co @xmath18=1 rovibrational emission were obtained for 54 of the 73 sources presented here .",
    "the data were obtained as part of a large m - band survey of herbig ae / be ( haebe ) and classical t tauri star ( ctts ) disks , obtained from 20002010 with nirspec @xcite on the keck ii telescope .",
    "the spectra will be described in detail in g.a .",
    "blake et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "however , we provide a few key results in this work , so as to compare with the spitzer - irs emission lines .",
    "detailed analysis has been previously presented for transitional disks @xcite and a few haebe disks @xcite , representing only a subset of the full survey .",
    "line fluxes for the p(6 ) and p(12 ) transitions are shown in tables [ table : fluxes ] and [ table : fluxes_haebe ] .",
    "upper limits are 3@xmath8 and assume a line width of 5@xmath19 @xmath1 m ( @xmath20 km s@xmath21 ) .",
    "detections of most molecules are strongly correlated with each other , even when haebe and transitional disk non - detections ( discussed in paper i ) are excluded from consideration . in figure",
    "[ fig : detect_hist ] we show the number of ctts in each of four categories : both h@xmath0o  and molecule x are detected , h@xmath0o  is detected but molecule x is not , molecule x is detected but h@xmath0o  is not , and neither molecule is detected .",
    "for all molecules it is much more common for both or neither of the molecules to be detected .",
    "additionally , by - eye inspection of the data shows that many of the sources with only some molecular detections display evidence for additional molecules at lower s / n ; therefore , it s likely that the various molecular emission features are even more strongly correlated . however , the co@xmath0-only sources discussed in paper i are a clear exception to this rule , and there may be others , such as haro 1 - 4 , which does not show strong evidence for h@xmath0o , but has strong hcn and c@xmath0h@xmath0  features .    in the lower left half of table [ table : detect_corr ] , we show probabilities ( @xmath22 ) associated with linear regression of the detections , treated as binary variables ( again , excluding haebe and transitional disks since they are all non - detections ) .",
    "for this and all future analyses , we define @xmath22 in a standard way , as the probability of obtaining a linear regression slope at least as high as that observed , assuming the variables are not related ( i.e. , the p - value associated with the t - statistic ) .",

    "we see that peak / continuum ratios are correlated between several of the molecules , especially h@xmath0o oh and hcn . line fluxes ( not normalized by the continuum ) are correlated for all molecular pairs , but this is largely due to the fact that all line fluxes are correlated with continuum fluxes , as we will show .",
    "the fact that peak / continuum ratios are correlated for many molecules may mean that the line excitation is significantly influenced by qualities of the disk and radiation environment .    despite the correlations between peak / continuum ratios , variations in line ratios are still observed ( and are evident as the scatter in figure [ fig : linecont_plot ] ) . in figure",

    ", we find that co line - to - continuum ratios are systematically lower for haebe and transitional disks , just as was found for h@xmath0o  ( paper i ) , making the co / h@xmath0o  ratios similar for all classes of objects .",
    "to obtain a better physical understanding of the source of the disk emission , we fit the irs data with emission models . in this work",
    ", we use an isothermal slab approximation , in which the emitting area @xmath191 , temperature @xmath13 , and column density @xmath11 are all free parameters .",
    "these models are the same as those utilized in @xcite , and assume a gaussian local line shape with width @xmath8=2 km s@xmath21 .",
    "we make no correction for disk inclination ( since this has been measured for only a small subset of our sample ) , so the @xmath191 we derive is a projected area , and @xmath11 is a slant column density .    the lines are not spectrally resolved with the spitzer - irs , and so the global line shape ( which depends on large - scale , largely keplerian motion , and disk orientation ) as well as the local line shape ( which depends on the local gas velocity ) are both unknown , but only the local line shape affects the slab model line flux .",
    "we choose a moderate value of the local line width , @xmath8 , equivalent to the thermal velocity of h@xmath0 at @xmath7700 k , or @xmath70.07@xmath192 at 1 au around a solar - mass star .",
    "this is a few times larger than the thermal velocity of h@xmath0o at 600 k and thus assumes some non - thermal gas motion .",
    "since the actual local line broadening is essentially unknown , we consider here the effect of our chosen assumption . for molecules like h@xmath0o which have emission features at a variety of optical depths ( @xmath193 ) , the best - fit @xmath11 scales roughly linearly with @xmath8 , since the data dictate @xmath193 , and @xmath194 . for molecules like hcn , for which the emission is likely optically thin , the choice of @xmath8 does not affect the total observed line flux , and thus does not affect the best - fit @xmath11 , unless @xmath8 is so small ( @xmath195 km s@xmath21 ) , that the emission becomes optically thick .",
    "however , such small line widths are unlikely , as velocities can not be sub - thermal , and @xmath13 is several hundred k for all molecules .",
    "there are many limitations to using this simple slab model .",
    "the actual disk environment is quite complex , with densities and temperatures that depend on both height and radius , so the slab model only represents some average conditions in the disk atmosphere .",
    "further , it has been shown that the line - excitation is not in lte @xcite , as was predicted by radiative transfer models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many of the more complex issues related to line excitation and disk structure are being pursued with these sophisticated models .",
    "on the other hand , the slab models offer the benefit of providing general characteristics of the emitting gas for a large number of disks , with a relatively small number of complications and free parameters .",
    "also , at least for h@xmath0o , non - lte / lte flux ratios remain close to unity for many transitions @xcite , and the lte results appear to reproduce the observed spectra reasonably well @xcite . here",
    ", we use the slab models to understand the bulk properties of the emitting atmospheres , to investigate the variety of emission observed , and to estimate molecular abundance ratios .",
    "the h@xmath0o  emission spectrum observed by the irs consists of lines with a large range of excitation temperatures and opacities , and so it is possible , in principle , to constrain all three model parameters ( @xmath191 , @xmath13 , and @xmath11 ) . in particular",
    ", @xmath191 is principally determined from the strengths of the optically thick lines , while @xmath11 and @xmath13 both affect the relative strengths of lines as a function of wavelength . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", there is only a small change in line strength across a wide range of wavelengths , in contrast to predictions from simple disk models .",
    "those authors interpret this observation as a depletion of water beyond @xmath7 1 au , perhaps due to a `` cold - finger '' effect .",
    "the slab model can not shed light on the radial distribution of the water abundance and the `` flatness '' of the spectrum is instead produced by a combination of high @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "( however , the fact that the slab model provides as good a fit as it does is consistent with the `` cold - finger '' effect hypothesis , as the spectra are reasonably well - fit by a single , relatively warm emitting temperature , equivalent to an inner disk emitting region with a sharp outer cutoff . ) in figure [ fig : chisq_plot ] , we show the dependence of @xmath196 on @xmath11 and @xmath13 , allowing @xmath191 to be a tunable variable , and note that there is a well - defined minimum , but that @xmath11 and @xmath13 are somewhat degenerate .    because of the complexity of the water spectrum , and the limitations inherent to the simple model , no slab model provides a perfect fit to the data , and different fitting methods can produce different outcomes .",
    "we chose to compute 65 line peaks for data and model , and minimize the difference between these two , with line peaks computed as the peak flux density minus an estimate of the local continuum .",
    "the set of lines includes any feature that could be reasonably distinguished from surrounding features , and the lines span wavelengths from 1035 @xmath1 m and thus a large range in excitation .",
    "this method does not require a global continuum fit , since it instead defines the continuum locally around each emission line .",
    "it is also not flux - weighted , and so takes weaker short - wavelength lines into account .",
    "we performed the fits by iterating over a grid of @xmath11 and @xmath13 , choosing a best - fit @xmath191 for each of these pairs , and then choosing the best overall fit ( based on the rms residuals ) .",
    "continuum - subtracted spectra were used to fit all other molecular features .",
    "the continuum was determined by fitting a spline to points along the spectrum where no strong h@xmath0o  or other emission features were expected .",
    "the preferred method and number of continuum points was carefully chosen to allow removal of broad - band features , such as those due to solid - state silicates , but not to remove narrower features due to gas molecules .",
    "however , uncertainties in continuum determination are unavoidable , and must be considered when determining the accuracy of any model fits .",
    "after continuum subtraction , the best - fit water model was also subtracted .",
    "we determined that our nominal h@xmath0o  fits , which used the entire irs wavelength range , did not produce a good match to the data below @xmath197 m .",
    "therefore , we performed a separate fit to water lines in the 1014 @xmath1 m region ( which typically require temperatures increased by @xmath7100 k and areas reduced by a factor of @xmath72 ) , and subtracted these fits below 14 @xmath1 m . finally , it was important to remove contributions from all other molecules ; we began by ignoring these contributions , and then performed a few iterations of model fits and subtractions .",
    "figure [ fig : removal_plot ] shows an example of the water model subtraction and its effect , for wx cha .",
    "some features are well - subtracted , but others are not , and these residuals affect the remaining molecular line shapes .    for molecules except for water , the models are sufficiently degenerate that @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath191 can not be determined simultaneously given our ( primarily systematic ) uncertainties .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : chisq_plot ] , which shows @xmath196 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath11 , where @xmath191 is adjusted to minimize residuals , and @xmath198 is set to 1 for the best fit . at low @xmath11 ( in the optically - thin regime ) @xmath191 and @xmath11 are completely degenerate , and so @xmath196 is insensitive to changes in @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath196 contours curve as @xmath11 enters the optically - thick regime , as the line shapes begin to be affected by the opacity , but fits still remain somewhat degenerate with respect to all three fit parameters .",
    "even when distinct minima exist ( as in the case of co@xmath0 ) they are not significant in a statistical sense , because of uncertainties in the continuum- and water - model - subtracted data .",
    "therefore , we have chosen not to fit all three parameters simultaneously .",
    "the following procedure was chosen to fit the molecular emission features .",
    "first , an appropriate range of @xmath13 was determined by computing a normalized mean emission feature and comparing with models , as shown in figure [ fig : shape_plot_all ] .",
    "then , fixing @xmath191 to @xmath199 , @xmath13 ( within the allowed range ) and @xmath11 were varied to minimize @xmath196 ( over a wavelength range wide enough to include all potential emission ) . a model with a different @xmath191",
    "could potentially produce a lower @xmath196 ( figure [ fig : chisq_plot ] ) , but we believe that the systematic uncertainties do not justify the choice of this model over others .",
    "this differs from the procedure chosen by @xcite , who simultaneously fit all three model parameters for all molecules except c@xmath0h@xmath0 .",
    "we stress that our modeling results are not inconsistent with theirs , but rather represent a more conservative approach based on our understanding of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "some care must be taken with the interpretation of our results , as the effective emitting regions are almost certainly different for each molecule .",
    "however , column densities can easily be adjusted as additional data place constraints on @xmath191 .",
    "the change in @xmath11 would be directly anti - proportional to changes in @xmath191 in the optically thin regime , but changes in @xmath11 will be more significant if the lines turn out to be optically thick .    to compute upper limits , we first estimated the emitting area , either by setting it equal to that derived for h@xmath0o  ( if observed ) or by using the results of a linear fit to best - fit emitting area versus distance - normalized @xmath200 .",
    "for each molecule , we then chose a characteristic temperature ( shown as dashed lines in figure [ fig : hist_plot ] ) and used the assumed emitting area to compute emission models .",
    "we used a 3@xmath8 detection limit for the line ( or band ) peak to compute a column density upper limit .",
    "for h@xmath0o we used the 17.2 @xmath1 m line limits .",
    "we fit co line fluxes for most co - emitting sources with an lte slab model following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "a few sources were omitted due to low s / n ( hd 244604 , hd 36917 , rr tau and hd 179218 ) and sr 21 was omitted because it is not well fit by an lte model @xcite .",
    "a rotation diagram was constructed from co emission line fluxes , and these were fit with a grid of lte models with @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath191 as free parameters .",
    "in addition , we used @xmath201co fluxes or non - detections as a constraint on @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we restricted our analysis to those sources with at least two line flux measurements at @xmath202 , as we found the fits otherwise unreliable .",
    "best - fit h@xmath0o  model parameters and upper limits are shown in tables [ table : moltable ] and [ table : moltable_b ] , and a histogram of these results is shown in figure [ fig : hist_plot ] .",
    "best - fit @xmath13 s cluster around 450 k , and best - fit @xmath11 s cluster around 10@xmath203 .",
    "temperatures of 450 k correspond to blackbody dust at a distance of 1.65 au at the surface of a passively heated disk with @xmath204k and @xmath205 @xcite .",
    "however , models predict that the gas in the disk s upper layers thermally decouples from the dust , so warm gas may exist at much larger distances from the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath206 is close to that derived from the water self - shielding process proposed by @xcite , but it should be kept in mind that the h@xmath0o  column densities in their models are derived in part from the irs observations themselves .",

    "these choices have non - negligible effects on the model parameters , and there is no ` right ' choice , since the model is much simpler than the true disk environment . as an example , if we fit only the region shortward of 14 @xmath1 m , we find slightly higher emitting temperatures ( by @xmath212 k ) and smaller emitting areas ( by a factor of @xmath7 2 ) than the nominal fits , consistent with the 1214 @xmath1 m lines originating predominately in a disk region closer to the star than the longer wavelength lines .",
    "if we fit the continuum - subtracted spectrum , instead of the individually measured line peaks , best - fit models differ from the nominal fit with higher @xmath13 ( by @xmath7100 k ) and @xmath11 ( by @xmath70.5 dex ) , and smaller @xmath191 ( by @xmath74@xmath213 ) .",
    "our best - fit @xmath13 differs more significantly from @xcite , because in that analysis @xmath191 was fixed at a much smaller value , based on co lineshapes ; @xmath11 remains similar for both analyses .",
    "figure [ fig : shape_plot_all ] shows the peak - normalized mean ( _ after _ subtraction of other molecular models ) of all hcn - emitting spectra .",
    "the hcn lineshape is fit by a narrow range of temperatures  600800 k  because at low @xmath13 the location of the line peak shifts longward , while at high @xmath13 , the model develops a prominent hot - band `` knee '' on the short - wavelength side of the feature .",
    "the underlying h@xmath0o features contribute up to @xmath214% of the flux in this region .",
    "therefore , in the case that the hcn is optically thin , the h@xmath0o  model subtraction results in , at most , a 40% correction in @xmath11 . however , if @xmath215 then the emission may be optically thick , and uncertainties in the h@xmath0o  flux subtraction could result in larger uncertainties in @xmath11 . with @xmath216 , the best - fit model parameters are shown in table [ table : moltable ] and figure [ fig : hist_plot ] .",
    "best - fit column densities range from a few @xmath217 to a few @xmath218 @xmath219 .",
    "there is an unaccounted - for residual in the @xmath713.8 - 13.9 @xmath1 m region , apparent in figure [ fig : shape_plot_all ] , but also visible in many individual spectra .",
    "one possible explanation is that the water has not been modeled correctly , but observed h@xmath0o  features do not line up well with the residual .",
    "the residual does line up with the @xmath220 and @xmath221 hot - bands of hcn , whose emitting levels are the lower states of the well - known 130 and 330 @xmath1 m submillimeter masers @xcite , respectively .",
    "these high - lying bending states can be fed either by radiative excitation through combination bands involving the fairly weak c - n ( @xmath222 ) stretching mode , or though chemical reactions that leave the product hcn highly vibrationally excited @xcite .",
    "thus , the presence of this residual suggests that the bending vibrational levels of hcn may be non - thermally excited , and that caution must be used in the interpretation of the q - branch profile using lte models .",
    "the mean c@xmath0h@xmath0  emission feature is shown in figure [ fig : shape_plot_all ] , after subtraction of both best - fit h@xmath0o  models and best - fit hcn models . with @xmath216 ,",
    "the emission is optically thin , and the suite of emission features is consistent with @xmath13 in the range 5001200 k. best - fit @xmath11 range from @xmath223 to @xmath224 @xmath219 .",
    "the derived @xmath11 will scale inversely with the assumed @xmath191 until column densities of @xmath225 when the emission starts to become optically thick .",
    "in addition to the residual at @xmath7 13.85 @xmath1 m , three residual peaks shortward of 13.6 @xmath1 m are prominent in many sources , and their origin is unknown .",
    "at least one peak lines up with an h@xmath0o  feature , and may be accounted for with a better h@xmath0o  model .",
    "the 13.55 @xmath1 m feature is at the location of a high - temperature oh emission line , and could be evidence for highly - excited oh , like that seen in tw hya @xcite .",
    "however , adjacent transitions in the oh rotational ladder are not apparent in the spectrum , and so this may not be the correct explanation .",
    "the mean co@xmath0 feature is shown in figure [ fig : shape_plot_all ] .",
    "the emission is mostly optically thin with @xmath216 , though slightly optically thick at the center of the q - branch peak .",
    "the complete suite of feature shapes is consistent with @xmath13 from 5001200 k , but best - fit @xmath13 cluster near 700 k. best - fit @xmath11 are @xmath226 @xmath219 and are inversely proportional to @xmath191 until @xmath227 @xmath219 .",
    "no significant residuals are noted ; those seen in figure [ fig : shape_plot_all ] are most likely h@xmath0o  model subtraction residuals or data - reduction artifacts .",
    "oh was fit with emission doublets from 17 to 30.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "line strengths decrease towards shorter wavelengths . derived excitation temperatures are strongly dependent on the strength of the relatively weak short wavelength lines , which are in turn dependent on the continuum subtraction , making @xmath13 somewhat more uncertain for oh than for other molecules .",
    "in addition , with @xmath216 , the low energy lines are beginning to become optically thick , and so the shape of the emission spectrum is influenced by both @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig : shape_plot_oh ] shows the rather large range of @xmath13 ( 7001600 k ) that may be appropriate for fitting oh , with the mean profile in this case composed of spectra normalized to the 30.7 @xmath1 m line peak .",
    "a much higher @xmath13 is inconsistent with the data , suggesting a difference between the emission observed here primarily in the long - high module , and the oh emission observed in the short - high module in the transitional disk tw hya @xcite , though the latter preferentially probe lines with higher excitation energy .",
    "potential evidence for higher excitation lines in our data is the residual line at 13.55 @xmath1 m ( discussed in ",
    "[ sec : c2h2 ] ) which is coincident with a high - excitation oh transition .",
    "high excitation temperatures may be indicative of non - thermal excitation , such as in the case of the `` prompt '' emission observed in comets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which rotationally - excited oh is produced via the photolysis of h@xmath0o .",
    "for the most part , the moderate excitation temperatures we observe are instead reasonable thermal temperatures for few - au disk atmospheres around ctts disks .",
    "best - fit temperatures are @xmath228800 k and typically lie between 900 and 1100 k. best - fit @xmath11 are near @xmath224 @xmath219 .",
    "the strongest lines are already becoming optically thick at these column densities , so @xmath11 could differ significantly if @xmath229 .",
    "for example , in a test with the emitting area reduced by a factor of 10 , we find the derived @xmath11 to be increased by about a factor of 25 .",
    "similarly , @xcite found column densities of @xmath230 @xmath219 when fitting 3 @xmath1 m oh emission features for dr tau and as 205 , which are a factor of @xmath750 higher than those found in this analysis ; however , emitting areas were fixed to values 27 and 30 times smaller , respectively .",
    "these @xmath11 are significantly smaller than those found by @xcite to be consistent with water self - shielding , but we note that higher @xmath11 of the right order for this process are not ruled out with smaller @xmath191 .",
    "best - fit model parameters can be seen in table [ table : co_fit_parameters ] and figure [ fig : hist_plot ] .",
    "temperatures are typically @xmath231 k , with a cluster at very high @xmath13 ( @xmath232 k ) , though temperatures this high may be unrealistic . despite the large range of @xmath13 , @xmath11 ranges over only about 1 dex , from @xmath710@xmath233 .",

    "the large differences between our work and that of @xcite arise from differences in derived column densities for both h@xmath0o  and any particular molecule , which are due to differences in choice of fitting method and assumptions , as discussed above .",

    "the brightest sources are being pursued at high resolution with current instrumentation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a more complete census of water - emitting disks may require the next generation of ground- and space - based mid - ir spectrographs .    co@xmath0/h@xmath0o  ratios in ices have been observed to be @xmath237 in a variety of environments @xcite , higher than our observed values and at the upper range of those derived by @xcite ( see the far right of figure [ fig : molratio_plot ] ) .",
    "this may reflect chemical evolution towards lower values in the inner disk region , as seen , for example , in the models of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : molratio_plot ] also shows molecular ratios derived from thermo - chemical disk models .",
    "disk - integrated column density ratios at 1 au from @xcite ( circles ) and @xcite ( stars ) are plotted to the right side of the observations , while column density ratios from the disk surface ( t@xmath228150 k ; stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from photo - dominated regions ( pdr ) modeled by @xcite ( triangles ) are plotted to the left .",
    "although we show ratios based on integrated vertical columns , these are likely not relevant for the disk surface being probed by the irs molecular emission .",
    "it is immediately apparent that comparisons of data and models can be quite complex .",
    "for example , orders of magnitude differences in molecular ratios are computed when considering different regions of the disk , both radially and vertically , for many molecules . and ,",
    "the emitted lines themselves originate from a range of disk radii and heights , which are not even the same from transition to transition .",

    "nevertheless , the scatter observed in column density ratios is smaller than some of the model differences , holding promise for observations to eventually distinguish between models .",
    "one thing we can already say is that the observed abundances of c@xmath0h@xmath0  require active carbon chemistry , such as that described in @xcite , as models without such networks produce nowhere near enough c@xmath0h@xmath0  in the inner disk atmosphere ; for example , @xcite find c@xmath0h@xmath0/h@xmath0o  ratios of @xmath238 ( not plotted ) . alternatively",
    ", the high abundance of c@xmath0h@xmath0  could be produced by the burning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; though the production of pahs may require c@xmath0h@xmath0  as a precursor ; see discussion in  [ sec : pah ] ) .    a more promising approach to comparing",
    "models and observations may be to couple thermo - chemical models with line - generating radiative transfer code , and directly compare output model spectra with observations .",
    "this approach has been pursued , for example , by @xcite for atomic fine - structure lines and low - j rotational co lines , as well as @xcite and @xcite for far - ir rotational lines of h@xmath0o .",
    "an alternative approach is to map abundance structures using observations and radiative transfer , and compare these to the abundances predicted by various thermo - chemical models .",
    "this approach has already yielded interesting results about water abundances @xcite , and we expect that it will lead to significant progress in the comparison of chemical models and observations in the near future .      in figure [",
    "fig : co_ratio_plot ] , we show molecular ratios with respect to co. we find h@xmath0o / co ratios slightly above 1  nearly the same as that found by @xcite and lying between vertically - integrated and disk surface model ratios .",
    "@xcite also find h@xmath0o / co ratios near 1 for several types of models .",
    "again , other molecular ratios are different from those found in @xcite because of our choice of modeling assumptions .",
    "the scatter in h@xmath0o / co ratio is only @xmath70.5 - 1 dex and so these ratios may prove helpful in distinguishing between chemical models .",
    "note , however , that we have found significantly different emitting areas for co and h@xmath0o and so the nirspec and irs emission lines are almost certainly probing different emitting regions .",
    "we have presented and analyzed spitzer - irs spectra of h@xmath0o , oh , hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0  and co@xmath0 and keck - nirspec spectra of co from a large sample of ctt and haebe disks .",
    "in addition to the detection dependence on spectral type and sed class ( transitional versus classical ) noted in paper i , we also find that detection efficiency depends on the disk color , @xmath15 , h@xmath2 equivalent width and , tentatively , on @xmath27 .",
    "radiative transfer disk models suggest a number of ways to enhance line emission , including increasing the molecular abundance , lowering the dust / gas ratio in the disk atmosphere , and increasing gas heating @xcite . since @xmath15 is a measure of the settling of small grains in the disk atmosphere",
    ", these data suggest that it may be necessary to lower the dust / gas ratio in the atmosphere in order to produce these lines .",
    "in addition , the correlation with h@xmath2 suggests that accretion is also important , perhaps because it provides additional heating for the excitation of lines .",
    "we find that detections , line fluxes and line - to - continuum ratios for nearly all molecules are correlated , suggesting a common origin or common excitation conditions for this forest of lines .",
    "line fluxes ( when detected ) are also correlated with continuum flux and many other covarying system parameters ( including l@xmath239 , m@xmath239 and @xmath27 ) , and once this variation is accounted for , no other statistically significant correlations are noted between line fluxes and system parameters . the observed correlation could be the result of any of these physical parameters , but a good candidate is the stellar luminosity , which provides heating for the line emission , and will also determine the size of the line - emitting region .",
    "although line fluxes are correlated , line flux ratios ( for example , hcn / h@xmath0o ) do vary from source to source .",
    "no obvious trends in line flux ratios are seen , but the variations suggest real chemical differences whose origin may be revealed with future study .",
    "we also compare the mid - ir emission lines with near - ir co vibrational emission observed with keck - nirspec .",
    "interestingly , co lines are often seen even when mid - ir emission is not , including in many haebe and transitional disks .",
    "however , rather than find evidence for different h@xmath0o / co ratios , we instead find that both transitional disks and haebe disks have systematically lower co line / continuum ratios , consistent with the reduced irs line / continuum ratios reported in paper i. this suggests possible systematic differences in line excitation between the two types of sources .",
    "while h@xmath0o  line strengths do differ significantly from source to source , the emission spectra are similar if normalized by line strength . in the context of an lte model , the line strength",
    "is primarily determined by the emitting area , and so this accounts for most of the variation .",
    "temperature and column density are then determined by the spectral slope .",
    "best - fit temperatures lie near 450 k and n@xmath4 for all sources , though results depend somewhat on the choice of fitting method and wavelength region .",
    "the high temperatures suggest an origin in the planet - forming ( few au ) region of the disk , and @xmath11 is consistent with chemical models of h@xmath0o  formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as with models that include uv destruction and h@xmath0o  self - shielding @xcite .",
    "other molecules are fit with a range of excitation temperatures , but all are representative of the planet - forming region of the disk , some 500 k or higher . because of model degeneracies , coupled with systematic uncertainties , we chose to fix emitting areas , but emitting areas and column densities can in the future be scaled to match results from additional observations . with this technique ,",
    "we derive molecular ratios with respect to water and co of @xmath6 for hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0 , co@xmath0 and oh . we find co / h@xmath0o  ratios near 1 , similar to values from previous observations @xcite and several disk models @xcite .",
    "it is not entirely straightforward to relate the column densities derived here to those derived from thermo - chemical disk models .",
    "however , the small scatter in observed molecular column density ratios , compared to large differences between models , suggests that comparisons between these data and output of line - generating thermo - chemical codes holds great promise for pinpointing the most important physical and chemical processes in protoplanetary disks .",
    "given the detections of a wide range of abundant molecules containing three primary elemental constituents of disks , oxygen , carbon and nitrogen , it is possible to compare the observed abundances of these species to the total expected elemental abundance , assuming solar values .",
    "obviously , not all molecular species have been observed , but what fraction of them are we likely to have seen ? using the average column density values from figure [ fig : hist_plot ] , we have accounted for total column densities of @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 , corresponding to ratios of @xmath243 and @xmath244 . comparing this to the solar ratios of @xmath245 and @xmath246 @xcite , it is apparent that carbon is relatively underrepresented , while we only detect a very small fraction of the available nitrogen .",
    "the uncertainties in the derived abundances , along with the possibility that the different species do not probe the same radii , probably preclude any strong conclusions to be drawn from the derived o / c ratio , except to note that it is consistent with the observed oxygen - dominated chemistry rich in h@xmath0o .",
    "the missing nitrogen , however , seems to indicate that a significant chemical reservoir still remains to be discovered .",
    "possible carriers of the remaining nitrogen are nh@xmath247 and n@xmath0 .",
    "nh@xmath247 emits strongly near 10@xmath1 m , so spitzer - irs can be used to place limits on its column density . with a conservatively low temperature ( 400 k ) and assuming the same emitting area as that for the h@xmath0o  fits , we find upper limits near 10@xmath248 , or only about 10@xmath213 the observed column density of hcn .",
    "therefore , nh@xmath247 can not account for the orders of magnitude of missing n. a smaller n deficiency has been noted in cometary observations @xcite , with one explanation being that n@xmath0 is the primary reservoir for n in the solar nebula , and is not easily retained by comets @xcite .",
    "thus , n@xmath0 may be a likely reservoir for the disks observed in this study as well .",
    "the elemental abundances discussed above place strict lower limits on the total column density of the warm molecular layer at @xmath71au .",
    "the strongest constraint is given by oxygen , even with a significantly unconstrained atomic o component . using the ism oxygen abundance",
    ", the thickness of the warm molecular layer must be at least @xmath249 .",
    "this is a very good match to existing models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the terrestrial planets in the solar system have a well - known deficit of carbon , by as much as three orders of magnitude relative to the elemental abundances in the sun .",
    "observations of polluted ( by accreting debris ) white dwarf atmospheres also indicate similar carbon deficits in other planetary systems @xcite .",
    "the high abundances of carbon observed in the inner disk surfaces apparently do not allow for a similar carbon deficit ; while absolute c and o abundances ( relative to h ) may remain uncertain , a carbon deficit of a factor @xmath250 would imply that the column densities of warm molecular gas are very large , at least @xmath11(h)@xmath251(co)@xmath252c@xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the fraction of c accounted for in the observed lines , and that a comparatively small fraction of the elemental oxygen is accounted for in the observations .",
    "both of these requirements seem implausible in light of recent thermo - chemical models .",
    "more likely , the observed high abundance of carbon in the gas phase indicates that only a small fraction of it will eventually be incorporated into terrestrial planets ( however , see the discussion of the formation of refractory organics in  [ sec : pah ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that primordial carbon grains are destroyed in the disk surface through chemisputtering by free oxygen atoms ; essentially they burn , producing co gas .",
    "if vertical mixing is efficient , these authors suggest that this process can reduce inner disk carbon to the observed solar system depletion levels as the co gas dissipates .",
    "we do observe the bulk of the gas - phase carbon in the form of co , a significant fraction of which could be formed by destruction of carbon grains . that there is",
    "no obvious observed carbon deficit in the gas phase is fully consistent with the picture proposed by @xcite . if all of the relatively volatile gas - phase co is removed , and assuming there is no carbon left in primordial grains , the carbon remaining in co@xmath0 , c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn is consistent with a carbon deficit of @xmath255 .",
    "the main uncertainty is likely the abundance of ch@xmath256 , which does not have emission bands in the range of the spitzer irs high resolution modules .",
    "non - detection of free carbon may indicate that it is not abundant in the disk surface @xcite .",
    "many protoplanetary disks are known to harbor pahs , at least in their surfaces @xcite , and some of them have emission spectra entirely dominated by the characteristic mid - infrared pah emission bands @xcite . while the detection fraction is high in haebe stars , the relative lack of exciting uv photons in disks around young solar analogs and lower mass stars makes positive detections difficult even if pahs are actually present in abundance @xcite . the observed pahs are likely analogs to the solar nebula precursors of the aromatic component of carbonaceous chondritic meteorites @xcite , which , due to their refractory properties , may represent an important route for delivery of organics to the surfaces of terrestrial planets .",
    "the pathway to pah presence in disks , however , is still debated .",
    "the formation of aromatics by hydrocarbon combustion chemistry in the atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch stars was proposed by @xcite and quantified using a detailed kinetic model .",
    "the model was applied to the solar nebula by @xcite to explain the abundance of aromatics in primitive chondritic meteorites .",
    "their finding is that the formation of pahs is predicated on ( 1 ) the presence of dense gas at temperatures of 900 - 1100k and ( 2 ) a high concentration of acetylene , c@xmath0h@xmath0 .",
    "their conclusions were , however , speculative since it was not known whether the necessary precursor , c@xmath0h@xmath0 , was indeed present in the early solar nebula .",
    "our finding that c@xmath0h@xmath0 is a common constituent of protoplanetary disk surfaces at temperatures of 6001200k therefore has direct implications for the synthesis of pahs within typical protoplanetary disks , including the solar nebula .",
    "@xcite find that the pah yield ( fraction of initial carbon atoms incorporated into pah molecules ) is a sensitive function of pressure as well as the initial c@xmath0h@xmath0 concentration .",
    "the most favorable pressures correspond to gas densities of @xmath7@xmath257 and high abundances of c@xmath0h@xmath0/h@xmath0@xmath7@xmath258 , leading to pah yields ( the fraction of c atoms in the initial gas incorporated into pahs ) of order unity .",
    "the observed c@xmath0h@xmath0  abundances are 12 orders of magnitude lower .",
    "however , actual pah yields may only be of order a few % , and a significant part of the c@xmath0h@xmath0 may already have been converted to pahs at the typical age of our disk sample ( 13myr ) .",
    "similarly , at sufficiently high abundances hcn can polymerize into purine and pyrimidine compounds ( such as those present in nucleic acids ) , and thus the observation of abundant c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn at 1000k supports the possibility of a complex organic/``soot ring '' chemistry in protoplanetary disks , which may be revealed by high resolution imaging , including mid - ir interferometry .",
    "alternatively , it has been shown that starting with abundant pah s , chemical reactions with h , oh and o tend to destroy pahs in the terrestrial planet - forming regions of disks @xcite .",
    "one by - product of this process is c@xmath0h@xmath0 , with a maximum c@xmath0h@xmath0/co ratio of @xmath259 . in either case ,",

    "<S> we present an analysis of spitzer - irs observations of h@xmath0o , oh , hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0 and co@xmath0 emission , and keck - nirspec observations of co emission , from a diverse sample of t tauri and herbig ae / be circumstellar disks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that detections and strengths of most mid - ir molecular emission features are correlated with each other , suggesting a common origin and similar excitation conditions for this mid - infrared line forest . aside from the remarkable differences in molecular line strengths between t tauri , herbig </S>",
    "<S> ae / be and transitional disks discussed in @xcite , we note that the line detection efficiency is anti - correlated with the 13/30 @xmath1 m sed spectral slope , which is a measure of the degree of grain settling in the disk atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we also note a correlation between detection efficiency and h@xmath2 equivalent width , and tentatively with accretion rate , suggesting that accretional heating contributes to line excitation . </S>",

    "<S> line fluxes are correlated with the mid - ir continuum flux , and other co - varying system parameters , such as @xmath3 . however , </S>",
    "<S> significant sample variation , especially in molecular line ratios , remains , and its origin has yet to be explained . </S>",
    "<S> lte models of the h@xmath0o  emission show that line strength is primarily related to the best - fit emitting area , and this accounts for most source - to - source variation in h@xmath0o  emitted flux . </S>",
    "<S> best - fit temperatures and column densities cover only a small range of parameter space , near @xmath4 and 450 k for all sources , suggesting a high abundance of h@xmath0o  in many planet - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> other molecules have a range of excitation temperatures from @xmath5k , also consistent with an origin in planet - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find molecular ratios relative to water of @xmath6 for all molecules , with the exception of co , for which n(co)/n(h@xmath0o)@xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> however , lte fitting caveats and differences in the way thermo - chemical modeling results are reported make comparisons with such models difficult , and highlight the need for additional observations coupled with the use of line - generating radiative transfer codes . </S>"
