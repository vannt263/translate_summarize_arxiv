    "<S> the evolution operator of the quantum walk with phase defect differs from evolution operator of the free quantum walk by a factor of @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> it resembles the evolution operator with non - zero potential in quantum mechanics , @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> this points to the interpretation that a phase defect localized at position @xmath2 is equivalent to a delta potential , @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation of defect explains the ramsauer effect in the quantum walk system because it also exists in double delta potential .    </S>",
    "<S> one dimensional quantum walk with single phase defect has been solved analytically for the scattering as well as bound states , showing existence of zero reflectance , or total transmittance , when the phase of the phase defect lies in certain range of values . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between scattering state and bound state may be achieved through tuning the phase of the defect . </S>",
    "<S> a generalization of these results to multiple defects indicates that the reflectance has multiple minima at specific values of the quasi - momentum @xmath18 , thus showing that preparation of the initial state of the quantum walker at several quasi - energy will yield zero reflectance . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a tool to select states of specific quasi - energy by suitably tuning the phase of the defects . with </S>",
    "<S> the recent formulation of quantum walk using two - component dirac like hamiltonian@xcite , our studies on phase defects can be extended to two and three dimensional lattice , decorated with periodic lattice of defects . </S>",
