    "it is well known that the choice of the interconnection network for a multicomputer or any complex system is one of the crucial problems the designer has to face .",
    "indeed , the network topology affects largely the performance of the system and it has an important contribution to its overall cost .",
    "as such topologies are modeled by either graphs , digraphs , or mixed graphs , this has lead to the following optimization problems :    1 .",
    "find graphs , digraphs or mixed graphs , of given diameter and maximum out - degree that have a large number of vertices .",
    "2 .   find graphs , digraphs or mixed graphs , of given number of vertices and maximum out - degree that have small diameter .    for a more detailed description of the problem , its possible applications , the usual notation , and the theoretical background see the comprehensive survey of miller and ir @xcite .",
    "for more specific results concerning mixed graphs , which are the topic of this paper , see , for example , nguyen and miller @xcite , and nguyen , miller , and gimbert @xcite .",
    "a mixed graph can be seen as a type of digraph containing some edges ( two opposite arcs ) .",
    "thus , a _ mixed graph _",
    "@xmath2 with vertex set @xmath3 may contain ( undirected ) _ edges _ as well as directed edges ( also known as _ arcs _ ) . from this point of view , a _ graph _",
    "( respectively , _ directed graph _ or _ digraph _ ) has all its edges undirected ( respectively , directed ) .",
    "in fact , we can identify the mixed graph @xmath2 with its associated digraph @xmath4 obtained by replacing all the edges by digons ( two opposite arcs or a directed @xmath5-cycle ) .",
    "the _ undirected degree _ of a vertex @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 , is the number of edges incident to @xmath6 .",
    "the _ out - degree _",
    "( respectively , _ in - degree _ ) of vertex @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath8 ( respectively , @xmath9 ) , is the number of arcs emanating from ( respectively , to ) @xmath6 . if @xmath10 and @xmath11 , for all @xmath12 , then @xmath2 is said to be _ totally regular _ of degree @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ( or simply _ @xmath13-regular _ ) . for mixed graphs ,",
    "the degree / diameter ( optimization ) problem is :    given three natural numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16 , find the largest possible number of vertices @xmath17 in a mixed graph with maximum undirected degree @xmath18 , maximum directed out - degree @xmath19 and diameter @xmath16 .",
    "this can be viewed as a generalization of the corresponding problem for undirected and directed graphs . for these cases ,",
    "the problem has been widely studied , see again miller and ir @xcite . in our general case ,",
    "buset , el amiri , erskine , miller , and prez - ross @xcite proved that the maximum number of vertices for a mixed graph of diameter @xmath16 with maximum undirected degree @xmath18 and maximum out - degree @xmath19 is :    @xmath20    where , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23    this bound applies when @xmath2 is totally regular with degrees @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , if we bound the total degree @xmath21 , the largest number is always obtained when @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "that is , when the graph is a digraph with no digons ( or ` edges ' ) . in general ,",
    "nguyen , miller , and gimbert @xcite showed that mixed graphs with @xmath26 ( or _ mixed moore graphs _ ) only exist for diameter @xmath27 .    in some of our constructions we use the moore bipartite graphs ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , which are known to exists only for diameters @xmath30 , with number of vertices @xmath31 ( notice that second expression assumes that @xmath32 , the case @xmath33 corresponds to a cycle with @xmath34 vertices . )",

    "it is also worth noting that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath96 in are precisely @xmath37 and @xmath38 given in .",
    "then , we have @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , and @xmath99    the bounds of proposition [ propo - moore ] apply when @xmath2 is totally regular with degrees @xmath13 .",

    "we suppose that our mixed graphs contains at least one edge ( @xmath118 ) , one arc ( @xmath119 ) and the diameter @xmath16 is at least three .",
    "it is easy to see that there are exactly two non - isomorphic mixed bipartite moore graphs for @xmath120 and @xmath0 ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "note that the mixed graph depicted in figure  [ fig2]@xmath121 is the line digraph of the cycle @xmath122 @xmath41seen as a digraph , so that each edge corresponds to a digon@xmath43 .",

    "in contrast with that , we next prove that mixed bipartite moore graphs do not exist for larger diameters .",
    "first of all , we recall that there is a unique shortest path between any ordered pair of vertices of distance less than @xmath16 in a mixed bipartite moore graph .",
    "let @xmath2 be a mixed bipartite moore graph and let us ` hang ' @xmath2 from any edge @xmath73 .",
    "we define the set @xmath134 , for @xmath135 , as the set of vertices at distance @xmath136 from @xmath6 such that the unique mixed path from @xmath6 does not pass through @xmath76 , that is , @xmath134 represents those vertices in the tree ` hanged down ' by @xmath6 at distance @xmath136 from @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath137 be the set ( possibly empty if @xmath138 ) of vertices adjacent from @xmath6 by an edge ( others than @xmath76 ) .",
    "let @xmath139 be the set of vertices adjacent from @xmath6 by an arc .",
    "let @xmath140 be any vertex at distance @xmath141 from @xmath37 such that @xmath140 is connected by an edge through its antecessor in the unique @xmath37-@xmath140 mixed path joining them ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath2 is @xmath13-regular , there must exist @xmath19 vertices @xmath142 such that @xmath143 is an arc for all @xmath144 .",
    "notice that either @xmath145 or @xmath146 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath140 belongs to the same vertex partition as the vertices in @xmath147 and as a consequence @xmath145 for all @xmath75 .",
    "notice that @xmath148 and @xmath149 are a partition of the vertex set @xmath150 .",
    "now , if one @xmath151 belongs to @xmath148 ( say @xmath152 ) , then we have two different paths from @xmath153 to @xmath140 of length @xmath154 : one path passing through @xmath6 and the other one passing through @xmath155 , which is impossible .",
    "so , we can assume that @xmath156 for all @xmath144 .",
    "now , since all the vertex sets @xmath157 are disjoint , there is exactly one @xmath151 in each set @xmath157 or there is a set @xmath157 containing at least two @xmath151 s . in the first situation , we have that there is one @xmath151 ( say @xmath158 ) into @xmath159 but then we have two different paths from @xmath37 to @xmath140 of length @xmath154 ( one shortest path of length @xmath141 and the other of length @xmath63 through @xmath158 ) . in the second situation , we have at least two @xmath160 belonging to the same set ( say @xmath157 ) and then we have again two different paths from @xmath161 to @xmath140 of length @xmath63 , which is a contradiction .    because of the previous result",

    ", we now investigate the case of diameter @xmath0 .",
    "we first show that , in contrast with the case of mixed moore graphs of diameter @xmath27 , where the possible spectrum imposes conditions on @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see bosk @xcite ) , a mixed bipartite moore graph has always a simple spectrum .",

    "then , @xmath168 satisfies the matrix equation @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the all-@xmath174 matrix .",
    "then , since such a matrix has eigenvalues @xmath175 , with multiplicity 1 , and @xmath126 with multiplicity @xmath176 , the eigenvalues of @xmath168 are the solutions of the equations @xmath177 and @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the hoffman - like polynomial @xmath180 the first equation has solution @xmath181 , as expected since @xmath182 , whereas the second one holds for @xmath183 and @xmath184 . finally , the multiplicities come from the fact that @xmath2 is bipartite and they must add up to @xmath175 .",
    "notice the particular case @xmath138 , where according to , the mixed graphs have only three distinct eigenvalues : @xmath104 and @xmath185 with multiplicity @xmath174 , and @xmath126 with multiplicity @xmath186 .",
    "this is precisely the case of the following family :      for any given integer @xmath188 , let us consider the line digraph of the complete bipartite graph ( seen as a symmetric digraph ) @xmath189 ( for example , figure  [ fig2]@xmath121 shows the case @xmath106 ) .",
