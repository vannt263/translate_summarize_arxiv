    "it was observed recently that @xcite , no resonance can decay to @xmath0 and @xmath1 with comparably measurable branching ratios , if electrons interact only with the electroweak gauge bosons and the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "that is to say , if both dielectron and diphoton channels are observed in experiments such as tevatron and/or lhc , one gets a smoking - gun evidence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "furthermore , this observation holds true for most conventional extensions of the sm , with the randall - sundrum ( rs ) @xcite model as an exception .",
    "specifically , the ratio @xmath4 for the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes @xmath5 of graviton is predicted to be exactly @xmath6 in the original rs - model . in variant rs - models ,",
    "this ratio could be different , but generically one expects to observe simultaneously @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states with comparable rates .",
    "we are thus led to examine carefully whether there are other extensions of the sm which can produce similar signals .",
    "first , let us recapitulate the arguments @xcite why @xmath7 and @xmath1 channels do not appear simultaneously in the sm . due to conservation of angular momentum , fermionic resonance can decay to neither @xmath0 nor @xmath8 final states .",
    "furthermore , landau - yang theorem @xcite prohibits a spin-1 resonance decaying into two photons , which follows from general assumptions of lorentz invariance , gauge invariance , and bose symmetry of the photons . in principle",
    ", a spin-0 resonance can decay to @xmath7 either through the electroweak gauge interaction or the yukawa interaction .",
    "however , the gauge channel is helicity suppressed while the yukawa channel is suppressed by the ratio of electron mass to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm higgs . for a resonance of spin-2 or higher spin , @xmath7 channel is forbidden at tree level simply because the resonance can not couple directly to a virtual spin-1 gauge boson .",
    "the arguments hold also true for the case of dimuon and diphoton signals , if the muon mass is much smaller than the energy scale of the resonance .",
    "thus comparably measurable dielectron and diphoton signals clearly imply that leptons must have direct interaction with either a spin-2 ( or higher spin ) boson or a new scalar beyond the sm higgs .",
    "the former possibility has been examined in @xcite where one gets the kk modes of rs graviton as a concrete example .",
    "this is actually not hard to understand , as gravity couples universally to energy - momentum tensor of any fields , including electrons and photons . in this letter",
    ", we will instead focus on the latter case , by considering models with new scalar fields that can decay into dielectron and diphoton with comparably measurable rates .",
    "in particular , we will concentrate on extensions of the sm with an extra higgs doublet , which is usually dubbed as the two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) .    in 2hdm , there are eight degrees of freedom in the scalar sector to start with .",
    "after spontaneously symmetry breaking , five scalars will remain but two of them are charged . among the three neutral ones ,",
    "one resembles the sm higgs and the additional two could play the role of new resonances .",
    "these neutral scalars couple to electron directly through yukawa interactions . to avoid constraints on the yukawa couplings due to the light electron mass compared to the electroweak scale ,",
    "the vev of the additional higgs doublet must be ( almost ) zero .",
    "this type of model is usually referred to as type iii 2hdm , in which the neutral scalars can decay to @xmath7 at tree level with significant rate .",
    "of course , care should be taken to avoid large fcnc and cp violation effects .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath1 decay is loop suppressed in these models and smaller than that in the sm due to the absence of contributions from gauge particles . to make a sizable diphoton decay rate , some mechanism for enhancement",
    "is needed for this loop level process .",
    "in the letter , we will see that such enhancement is still feasible within current experimental limits .",
    "putting all things together , the extra scalars can be made to decay into both @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states with comparably measurable branching ratios .",
    "as one would have expected , here one has to choose parameters properly and certain level of fine tuning is necessary .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we will show how to get significantly comparable branching ratios for @xmath7 and @xmath1 channels in 2hdm .",
    "phenomenological constraints on these models are presented in section iii , including the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons , electric dipole moment(edm ) of leptons , the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "generically leptonic yukawa couplings in 2hdm are mostly constrained by the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron , instead of by the lfv processes .",
    "the results are summarized in section iv .",
    "in type iii 2hdm , one scalar doublet resembles the role of the sm higgs boson , which will be denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "we denoted the additional doublet as @xmath12 .",
    "the general interaction between @xmath12 and fermions reads @xmath13 with left ( right ) handed projection @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are left handed quark ( lepton ) doublets , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are right handed up quark , down quark and lepton singlets , respectively , with family indices @xmath20 . in general , all yukawa matrices @xmath21 are non - diagonal and complex and fermions are diagonalized here , so all fermions are already in their mass eigenstates . ] .",
    "this may result in fcnc and cp violating effects , which will be addressed in the next section .",
    "the general higgs potential @xcite which spontaneously breaks @xmath22 down to @xmath23 in 2hdm is @xmath24 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\lambda_4 [ ( \\phi_1^+ \\phi_1 ) ( \\phi_2^+ \\phi_2)-(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)(\\phi_2^+ \\phi_1)]+ \\lambda_5 [ re(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)-v_1v_2\\cos\\xi]^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\lambda_{6 } [ im(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)-v_1v_2\\sin\\xi]^2   , \\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath25 s are all real parameters .    in type i and type ii 2hdm ,",
    "the non - zero vevs of @xmath11 and @xmath12 make contributions to fermion masses proportional to the corresponding yukawa couplings in ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "the branching ratio of the @xmath0 final state from scalar particles is severely suppressed by the tiny electron mass . in type iii 2hdm",
    ", those yukawa couplings are not confined by such constraints , since @xmath12 has a ( almost ) zero vev .",
    "one might hope to find viable models with comparably measurable branching ratios for @xmath7 and @xmath1 channels .",
    "only @xmath26 has a non - zero vev while @xmath27 does not in type iii 2hdm .",
    "that is , @xmath28 we can thus choose a gauge such that @xmath29 in this gauge , the potential in ( [ potential ] ) can be re - expressed as , @xmath30h^2+\\left ( \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_4 v^2 \\right ) h^-h^++\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_5 v^2 \\right ) h^2_1\\nonumber \\\\&+&\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_6 v^2\\right ) h^2_2+\\textrm{(interaction terms)}\\ , , \\label{potential2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one sees that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are mass eigenstates , i.e. , there is no mixing between the higgs bosons . to be definite",
    ", @xmath33 is always assumed to be lighter than @xmath34 , without losing any generality .",
    "now we will see how to make @xmath33 decaying into both @xmath7 and @xmath1 channels with comparable and significant rates .     at one - loop level .",
    "the internal lines represent either leptons or quarks . , height=188 ]    it is clear from ( [ lagrangian ] ) that @xmath33 decays into @xmath0 at the tree level . by ignoring the electron mass ,",
    "the decay width is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass of @xmath33 and @xmath37 is the yukawa coupling between @xmath33 and electron .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath33 decays to @xmath1 through triangle fermion loop ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig_higgs_to_two_gamma ] ) ) .",
    "notice that the triangle gauge boson loops , which are dominant in the sm , are absent here .",
    "this is because that the term @xmath38 only results in a four - point vertex @xmath39 due to the vanishing vev of @xmath12 .",
    "similarly the scalar loops do not appear here either .",
    "( [ fig_higgs_to_two_gamma ] ) yields the following decay amplitude , @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "there are both cp even amplitude @xmath42 and cp odd amplitude @xmath43 , as the yukawa couplings are complex , @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 for the virtual fermions to be charged leptons , up quarks or down quarks .",
    "@xmath48 are their charges .",
    "the decay width of @xmath49 is thus , @xmath50 which agree with results in @xcite .",
    "now we are in a position to make @xmath33 decays into @xmath7 and @xmath1 with comparable and significant rate . to enhance the loop - suppressed @xmath1 channel , the yukawa couplings of @xmath33 to heavy leptons and/or quarks",
    "should be much larger than that of @xmath33 to electron .",
    "let us first consider case of a quark - phobic @xmath12 .",
    "we need then a heavy lepton to have a large coupling with @xmath12 , which we may , for example , choose it to be the @xmath51 lepton . taking the mass of @xmath33 to be a few hundred gev ,",
    "@xmath52 is required to make the branching ratios for @xmath7 and @xmath1 comparable .",
    "however with this parameter set , the @xmath7 channel would be too rare to be observable : @xmath53 so a quark - phobic @xmath12 will not work .    at first glance , the same would happen if @xmath12 has large couplings to quarks .",
    "naively , @xmath54 would make @xmath7 final state too scarce to be observed .",
    "fortunately , if the mass of @xmath33 is smaller than @xmath55 gev , roughly twice of top quark mass , @xmath33 can not decay to top quark pairs . in this case",
    ", one can make the @xmath7 and @xmath1 decay channels comparable and observable , by having @xmath56 and keeping the yukawa couplings between @xmath12 and the other quarks small .",
    "@xmath33 can not be too light either , otherwise it should have been observed at lep already , as the coupling between @xmath33 and electrons is not too small in this model . for illustrations",
    ", we will take ( somewhat _ ad hoc _ ) @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the following numerical discussions .    to get @xmath59/@xmath60",
    ", one needs the ratio of yukawa couplings to be @xmath61 . to make @xmath7 and @xmath1 decay channels observable",
    ", we may assume universal coupling of @xmath33 to all fermions except the top quark and other fermions need only to be of the same order of @xmath37 .",
    "a universal coupling is not necessary , though it makes numerical analysis simpler . ] . with this parameter set",
    ", the main decay channel will be @xmath62 .",
    "it is then easy to estimate the branching ratios : @xmath63 which is not too small and should be measurable .",
    "therefore with such a specific parameter set , it would be possible for type iii 2hdm to produce significant and comparable branching ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath8 decays .    in this parameter set",
    ", the production of @xmath33 at hadron collider is mainly through gluon fusion , which is similar to that of the sm higgs .",
    "therefore , to copiously produce @xmath33 at an observable rate , one would expect @xmath64 to be of order one .",
    "generically , one needs @xmath37 to be no less than @xmath65 . in the following",
    ", we will discuss whether this is possible concerning phenomenological constraints from low energy processes .",
    "with extra not - so - heavy higgs particles , the type iii 2hdm has rich phenomenological implications at low energy .",
    "for example , it may contribute to the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons , which have been measured to very high precision .",
    "complex phases of the yukawa couplings of @xmath33 to leptons may contribute to leptonic edms at one - loop level .",
    "finally , non - diagonal yukawa couplings of @xmath33 to leptons would lead to lfv processes , such as @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "non - diagonal yukawa couplings of @xmath33 to quarks might produce large hadronic fcnc processes and complex phases may induce cp violating effects in hadrons , which are both tightly constrained experimentally .",
    "however these couplings do not affect @xmath7 and @xmath1 signals at all , therefore we will simply assume that their effects can be tuned away and not consider them further .    the complex yukawa matrix for leptonic couplings @xmath68 contains @xmath69 real parameters , which are obviously too many .",
    "so we will consider two extreme scenarios , just for illustration , in numerical discussions :    scenario i ( s1 ) : the leptonic yukawa matrix is diagonal with a universal cp phase @xmath70 , i.e. @xmath71 , with @xmath72(for @xmath73 ) and @xmath74(for @xmath75 ) .",
    "scenario ii ( s2 ) all leptonic yukawa couplings are assumed to have universal magnitude with cp phase @xmath70 , namely @xmath76 .",
    "actually , numerical analyses in these two scenarios yield rather reasonable estimates on constraints on the general yukawa matrix .      for the electron ,",
    "the experimental data gives @xmath78 @xcite which agrees well with the sm calculation @xmath79@xcite .",
    "the extra scalars in 2hdm may contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment at one - loop level , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_g-2_edm ] ) .",
    "we will assume @xmath80 which is slightly larger than the theoretical error , to get a restriction on the corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "for muon , there is some discrepancy between experiments and the sm calculation @xcite : @xmath81 , so we assume an upper limit @xmath82 .",
    "( [ fig_g-2_edm ] ) yields the one - loop contribution to @xmath77 via neutral and charged higgs as @xmath83\\label{eq_g-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath84 .    in s1 ,",
    "the expression ( [ eq_g-2 ] ) is proportional to @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) for electron ( muon ) anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "that is why , though the upper limit on @xmath87 is about @xmath88 times larger than that of @xmath89 , the constraint @xmath90 from @xmath82 is more severe than the limit @xmath91 from @xmath92 .    in s2 ,",
    "the expression ( [ eq_g-2 ] ) is dominated by @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) term for the electron ( muon ) anomalous magnetic moment . in this scenario ,",
    "the electron @xmath77 leads to @xmath95 , which is slightly smaller than the restriction @xmath96 from the muon @xmath77 .",
    "the electron and muon edms are extremely small in the sm , which arise at three - loop level .",
    "but in the present model , the complex yukawa couplings give rise to non - zero edms at one loop level , as shown in fig.([fig_g-2_edm ] ) .",
    "thus these couplings might be severely constrained by the experimental data .",
    "the current experimental measurements cited by pdg2008 @xcite are @xmath97 e cm and @xmath98 e cm .",
    "the corresponding upper limits can be found in the original experimental literature : @xmath99 e cm ( 90% c.l.)@xcite and @xmath100 e cm ( 95% c.l.)@xcite .",
    "we will use these upper limits , instead of the pdg numbers , to obtain constraints .",
    "the leptonic edm @xmath101 ( @xmath84 ) has contributions from neutral higgs bosons @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 and charged one @xmath102 .",
    "the contribution from the internal @xmath102 is suppressed by the neutrino masses , which can be safely dropped .",
    "the contribution from the neutral higgs bosons is @xmath103 \\,,\\label{eq_edm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , @xmath101 vanishes when the phase of @xmath68 is zero and will not yield any constraints on the yukawa couplings .",
    "if only virtual @xmath51 lepton is considered inside the loop and the external lepton mass is neglected , our formula agrees with @xcite .",
    "the above equation is also consistent with @xcite .    in s1 ,",
    "the expression ( [ eq_edm ] ) is proportional to @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) for electron ( muon ) edm .",
    "it is then straightforward to find @xmath106 and @xmath107 from the experimental upper limits .    in s2 ,",
    "the expression ( [ eq_edm ] ) is dominated by @xmath108 term for both @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "therefore the constraint @xmath111 from @xmath109 is significantly tighter than the limit @xmath112 from @xmath110 .",
    "decay in 2hdm at one - loop level.,height=188 ]    both neutral scalars @xmath113 and charged one @xmath102 can contribute to @xmath114 decay through loop diagrams , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_mu_to_e_and_gamma ] ) .",

    "we find numerically the restriction @xmath124 from the @xmath125 channel , which is smaller than the constraint @xmath126 from the @xmath3 channel .",
    "we have so far found that , type iii 2hdm may produce comparably observable @xmath0 and @xmath1 signals simultaneously from decays of neutral scalars .",
    "this provides an interesting alternative to the rs model . to make this happen ,",
    "certain amount of fine tunings are necessary .",
    "first , to enhance the loop suppressed @xmath1 channel to be comparable with @xmath7 channel , the yukawa coupling of @xmath33 to top quark ( @xmath64 ) must be a few thousand times larger than those to the rest of fermions .",
    "in addition , the mass of @xmath33 should be smaller than twice of the top quark mass , to prevent @xmath33 decays predominantly to top - anti - top pair . under these conditions",
    ", @xmath33 would decay mainly to two gluons , with the branching ratios of @xmath7 and @xmath1 channels to be about half a percent .",
    "notice that these requirements determine only the relative strength of different yukawa couplings , while their absolute sizes would determine the number of events produced in colliders .",
    "if the parameters in these models do meet the above requirements , @xmath33 will be mainly produced via gluon fusion in hadron colliders , analogous to the sm higgs .",
    "for @xmath33 to be produced roughly at the same rate as the sm higgs , @xmath64 needs to be of order one , which means that the electron yukawa coupling @xmath37 should be around few @xmath127 .",
    "generically , the non - diagonal and complex yukawa couplings lead to fcnc and cp violating processes .",
    "we have thus examined constraints from the anomalous magnetic moment and edm of leptons , lfv processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 . because of the large number ( 18 in total ) of free parameters in yukawa interactions , we have chosen two scenarios as illustration for numerical discussions . in the scenario of diagonal yukawa couplings with an universal cp phase",
