    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) plays a very important role in the research of fundamental interactions . up to now , most investigations are focussed on dcsb with mass generation for the fermions .",
    "in such a scenario , the bilinear fermion condensate is taken as the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking and it is known that it can receive a nonzero value when the coupling of the system exceeds some critical value . for a review on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "but this is not the complete story for dcsb , since the order parameter may not be the bilinear fermion condensate : in principle , higher @xmath0-point functions which break chiral symmetry might become nonzero , without dynamical mass generation for the fermions @xcite . in a massless @xmath1 gauge theory for example ,",
    "four - fermion green s functions which break chiral symmetry might become nonzero at values of the coupling below the critical value for dynamical mass generation .",
    "such a breaking of the chiral symmetry by the four - fermion condensates , without mass generation for the fermions , was discussed recently by holdom and triantaphyllou @xcite , who have calculated these four - point functions numerically and found a critical coupling constant which is almost the same as that responsible for dynamical mass generation .",
    "one could also think of theories where some other symmetry prevents the dynamical generation of a bilinear condensate and a dynamical fermion mass , but where a nonzero condensate of a higher @xmath0-point function is not restricted by this symmetry . in a chiral gauge theory ,",
    "the gauge symmetry will be broken by the generation of a fermion mass , but a chirality - changing four - fermion condensate does not break the gauge symmetry , and might therefore be generated dynamically .",
    "in such a scenario , the chiral symmetry can be realized in more delicate way which may be useful for model building @xcite : it allows for a hierarchy of chiral symmetry breaking , first by the four - fermion condensate at relatively small values of the coupling , and eventually a second phase transition , at higher values of the coupling , leading to mass generation for the fermions , due to the four - fermion condensates . for these purposes one should study this phenomenon in a chiral gauge theory , as suggested in @xcite , but for simplicity and to see whether such a symmetry breaking patterns is possible , we restrict ourselves to a @xmath1 gauge theory .    in our paper",
    "we confirm analytically the numerical results obtained by holdom and triantaphyllou @xcite , using a slightly different method to calculate the nonperturbative four - fermion functions .",
    "we find that there is a critical coupling for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking via the four - fermion condensates , below which there are no nontrivial solutions for the four - fermion functions which break chiral symmetry , but preserve parity , lorentz symmetry , and the flavor symmetry .",
    "this critical coupling is ( in our truncation scheme ) exactly the same as the critical coupling for fermion mass generation .",
    "this result is obtained by calculating the loop expansion of the effective action to leading order for the nonperturbative four - point functions .",
    "our result is also in agreement with an intuitive argument comparing the condensation of two fermions to the condensation of four fermions : for the four - fermion condensate we need at least the same binding force as for the bilinear fermion condensate .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss some general features about dynamical symmetry breaking , and we show how in principle the chiral symmetry can be broken without mass generation for the fermions . in sec .",
    "[ seceffact ] , we derive a linear integral equation for the four - fermion function , using the loop expansion of the effective action .",
    "next , we analyze this equation for the nonperturbative chirality - changing four - fermion functions , using some expansions in order to perform the angular integrations analytically ; more details can be found in the appendix .",
    "we find that there is a critical coupling for these functions ; this critical coupling turns out to be the same as the critical coupling for dynamical mass generation .",
    "finally we give some concluding remarks in sec .",

    "the kind of symmetry breaking we are dealing with in this paper is the breaking of chiral symmetry in a @xmath1 gauge theory with @xmath2 massless fermion flavors .",
    "the global continuous chiral symmetry is @xmath3 , and this symmetry can be broken in different ways , characterized by the corresponding chiral order parameters .",
    "since the flavor symmetry is not broken in vector - like gauge theories @xcite , only flavor - symmetry invariant order parameters may receive nonzero contributions ; also parity @xcite and lorentz symmetry is believed not to be broken spontaneously , so in this paper we limit us to parity- , flavor- , and lorentz - invariant order parameters .",
    "the simplest and most wellknown way of breaking the chiral symmetry is characterized by the trace of the two - point function @xmath4 .",
    "this condensate , @xmath5 , is the only possible two - fermion condensate which keeps the flavor symmetry and is parity and lorentz invariant .",
    "it gives rise to a dynamically generated fermion mass , and the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath6 an explicit mass for the fermions would also break the symmetry in this way .    however , this is not the only way to break the chiral symmetry , an alternative way is characterized by condensates of four fermions .",

    "these four - fermion functions gives the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath12 here @xmath13 is a nontrivial chiral subgroup which plays a role in preventing dynamical mass generation for the fermions .",
    "it corresponds to the discrete chiral transformation @xmath14 and therefore the fermions remain massless in such a breaking of the chiral symmetry .",

    "the other 52 independent functions are not all parity - invariant or lorentz scalars , which means they will not receive nonzero condensates , assuming that the lorentz symmetry and parity remains unbroken .",
    "however , it is not excluded that ( some of ) the nonlocal four - fermion functions become nonzero , in which case they might couple to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 type functions .",
    "we leave this problem to future investigations and for simplicity we only consider the nonperturbative four - point functions which are flavor- , lorentz- and parity - invariant .",
    "this scenario can easily be generalized to condensates of @xmath18 fermions , breaking the chiral symmetry into @xmath19 with the nontrivial chiral subgroup @xmath20 , corresponding to the discrete chiral transformation @xmath21 unbroken .",
    "it is wellknown that if a continuous symmetry of the lagrangian is broken dynamically , there will appear some massless bosons , the socalled goldstone or nambu ",
    "goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "these goldstone bosons couple both to the conserved current which is associated with the symmetry , and to some fields @xmath22 which characterize the breaking of the symmetry .",

    "the breaking of chiral symmetry means that this order parameter becomes nonzero , and due to the chiral ward ",
    "takahashi identity this leads to a pole at zero momentum in the above green s function ; in the limit @xmath25 this green s function behaves as @xmath26    to be more specific , we first consider conventional chiral symmetry breaking , with a dynamically generated mass for the fermions . in that case , the composite field @xmath27 is @xmath28 , and the chiral ward ",
    "takahashi identity leads to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the full fermion propagator . from this equation ,",
    "we see immediately that a dynamically generated mass for the fermions will lead to a massless pole in the pseudoscalar green s function @xmath31 if @xmath32 ; this pole corresponds to the massless goldstone boson .    in the case of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking through the four - point functions , as we are considering here , the situation is somewhat more complicated since we have to consider a composite field @xmath22 which consists of four fermion fields . using the chiral ward ",
    "takahashi identity , one can show that the green s functions @xmath33 have to satisfy the relation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fourier transform of a four - fermion function , with momentum conservation @xmath36 . in the limit @xmath37 , this leads to massless poles , if either the @xmath16 type or the @xmath17 type four - fermion function @xmath38 is nonzero .",
    "this can be seen easily by decomposing the green s function @xmath39 into @xmath40 so eq .  ( [ axward ] ) leads to @xmath41 thus massless goldstone bosons appear as soon as any of these nonperturbative four - point functions becomes nonzero .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to _ local _ composite fields @xmath22 we get a similar expression , but now involving the _ condensates _ of these four - point functions . defining the condensate as @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes either @xmath16 or @xmath17 , the chiral ward ",
    "takahashi identity relates this condensate to the goldstone bosons . in momentum space",
    "this finally leads to massless poles for @xmath44 @xmath45 thus the condensates of the four - point functions we are considering here are directly related to the existence of massless goldstone bosons .",
    "note that both a nonzero condensate and a nonzero four - point function would signal dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , and in principle it is conceivable that the condensate is zero , and the four - point function not ; the other way around ( no nonzero four - point function , but only a nonzero condensate ) is obviously impossible . in this paper , instead of four - fermion condensate , we directly calculate four - point function and take it as a generalized order parameter .",
    "the generalization to the case of @xmath46 fermion flavors is in principle straightforward ; also the generalization to higher @xmath0-point functions is a trivial exercise .",
    "in order to calculate the chirality - changing four - fermion functions , we need some nonperturbative calculation scheme . for this purpose , we use a loop expansion of the effective action @xcite . for simplicity we will restrict ourselves to just one fermion flavor ,",
