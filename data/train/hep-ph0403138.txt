    "therefore , as we have found in @xcite , it is extremely important to combine both @xmath2 and @xmath1 channels , as the first one , due to a large background leading to large interference effects is very sensitive to a phase , while the second one - to a partial width . from combined analysis of @xmath2 and @xmath7 decay channels",
    "the @xmath9 partial width  can be measured with an accuracy of 3 to 8% and the phase of the @xmath10 amplitude  with an accuracy between 30 and 100  mrad .",

    "a good invariant - mass resolution is essential for the considered measurement . for the @xmath2 events only @xmath20 decay channel",
    "is considered , as without knowing the exact beam - photon energies , which is always a case for the photon collider , the semileptonic @xmath21 decays worsen the mass resolution . the final selection efficiency for @xmath22 events",
    "is found to lay between 20% for @xmath23  200 gev and 16% for @xmath23  400 gev ( including 47% probability for hadronic decays of both @xmath21 ) .",
    "the resolution in the reconstructed @xmath9 invariant mass for these events , described by the parameter @xmath24 ( from the breit  wigner type fit ) , changes from about 6.5 gev at =  200  gev to about 13 gev at =  400  gev .    for @xmath7 events ,",
    "only @xmath25 decay channel is considered , where one @xmath26 decays into @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "lepton tagging and the invariant - mass reconstruction for both the lepton pair and the two hadronic jets is crucial for a suppression of the background from the direct @xmath22 events . after all cuts , the selection efficiency for @xmath29 events is only about 5% , mainly due to a small branching ratio for the considered channel ( 9.4% for @xmath30 ) , however , the final sample is very clean . for the @xmath31 final state we get the invariant - mass resolution @xmath24 changing from about 5.5 gev at =  200 gev to about 7.5 gev at =  400 gev .",
    "details of event selection and the description of the invariant mass resolution are given in @xcite .",
    "the invariant - mass resolutions obtained from a full simulation of @xmath2 and @xmath7 events ( based on the pythia and simdet programs ) , have been parametrized as a function of the  centre - of - mass energy , .",
    "they can be used to obtain the parametric description of the expected invariant mass distributions , for @xmath22 and @xmath19 events , avoiding time consuming event generation procedure . for arbitrary model , and for arbitrary values of model parameters ,",
    "expected mass distributions can be calculated by numerical convolution of the parametrized resolutions with the compaz spectra and the cross section formula .",
    "this approach , developed in @xcite , was used to obtain results described in the remaining part of this paper .",
    "in this section we summarize results of @xcite , where the feasibility of measuring the standard model higgs - boson @xmath2 and @xmath7 decay channels at the  option of tesla has been studied for a higgs - boson mass above 150  gev .",
    "the signal , i.e. the higgs - boson decays into the vector bosons , and the background from direct vector - bosons production are used to extract the width and the phase of the loop coupling @xmath33 . for the @xmath29 final - state a direct , i.e. non - resonant",
    ", process is rare as it occurs via loop only . on contrary ,",
    "the non - resonant @xmath34 production is a tree - level process , and is expected to be large .",
    "therefore , also an interference between the signal of @xmath34 production via the higgs resonance and the background from the direct @xmath34 production may be large .",
    "this effect can be used to access an information about the phase . for the higgs - boson masses around 350  gev we found in @xcite that the phase  is more sensitive to the loop contributions of new , heavy charged particles than the width  itself .    the parametric description of the expected invariant mass distributions for @xmath22 and @xmath19 events was obtained by the numerical convolution of the cross - sections formula ( including  and  as model parameters ) with the compaz spectra and the parametrized resolution . based on this description ,",
    "many experiments were simulated , each corresponding to one year of a photon collider running at tesla at a nominal luminosity .",
    "the `` theoretical '' distributions were then fitted , simultaneously to the `` observed '' @xmath2 and @xmath7 mass spectra , with the width  and phase  considered as the only free parameters . assuming the standard model higgs - boson branching ratios , and with a proper choice of the electron - beam energy , the @xmath9 partial width can be measured with an accuracy of 3 to 8% , while the phase of the amplitude with an accuracy between 35 and 100  mrad  @xcite .",
    "the  measurement opens a new window to a precise determination of the higgs - boson couplings and to search for a `` new physics '' .",
    "it turns out that the phase is constrained predominantly by the @xmath2 invariant - mass distribution , thanks to the large interference between higgs - boson decay into @xmath2 and non - resonant ( sm ) @xmath2 production .",
    "however , the two - photon width of the higgs - boson is much better constrained by the measurement of the @xmath7 mass spectra , as the non - resonant background is much smaller here .",
    "a precise determination of both parameters is only possible when both measurements are combined .",
    "the promising results obtained for the sm higgs boson encourage to the evolution of the analysis towards the models with more higgs doublets . presented analysis extends the approach developed for sm higgs boson to the selected two higgs doublet model  ( ii ) scenarios .",
    "for all considered sets of parameter values the expected invariant mass distributions were calculated , taking into account model predictions for both the production cross - section ( including interference term contributions ) and the higgs - boson branching ratios .",
    "parametrized distributions were used to simulate many experiments , each corresponding to one year of a photon collider running .",
    "errors ( and correlations ) in  and  measurement , expected from the simultaneous fit to the observed @xmath2 and @xmath7 mass spectra , where then used to determine expected uncertainties of model parameters .",
    "in our previous analysis @xcite we indicated possible deviations from the standard model predictions resulting from the loop contributions to the @xmath36 vertex of new heavy charged particles .",
    "however , deviations in the two - photon width and phase can also appear if the couplings of the higgs - boson to the other particles are different than those predicted by the standard model .",
    "both such effects are taken into account in this analysis , based on a simple extension of sm , namely 2hdm  ( ii ) , see also @xcite .    in this section",
    "we consider the two higgs doublet model",
    "( ii ) ( 2hdm  ( ii ) ) with cp conservation .",
    "the higgs sector of such model contains @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 bosons , and is characterized ( in the @xmath39 symmetric case ) by mixing angles @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the simplest version of the 2hdm is the case where couplings are parametrized by one mixing angle .",
    "often one considers 2hdm when @xmath0 couples to gauge bosons as in sm - however then also all yukawa couplings are as in sm .",
    "here we assume instead that the yukawa couplings of @xmath0 are equal ( up to sign ) to the corresponding sm higgs - boson couplings .",
    "then the coupling of @xmath0 to gauge bosons is governed by , as it is shown in table  [ tab:2hdm ] .",
    "the corresponding yukawa and gauge boson couplings of @xmath3 and @xmath37 bosons are also uniquely determined by , as can be seen in the table .",
    "note that here @xmath3 and @xmath37 have similar yukawa couplings ( up to @xmath42 factor ) . and @xmath43 vertexes appear .",
    "the couplings of @xmath0 and @xmath3 to the charged higgs boson @xmath38 , contributing to such vertexes , are calculated according to the 2hdm ii potential @xcite assuming @xmath44=0 .",
    "] this scenario , called by us a model @xmath35 , can be treated as a generalized standard model - like 2hdm  ( ii ) scenario @xmath45 for @xmath0 , introduced in @xcite .",
    "solutions @xmath46 and @xmath47 of @xcite correspond to our model @xmath35 in the limit of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .    in 2hdm",
    "there is a possibility that one of the higgs boson couplings vanishes , for example the coupling to the ew gauge bosons .",
    "the corresponding sum rule @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes a fermion or a vector boson , @xmath52 , ensures only that at least one of the other higgs bosons has a nonzero coupling . in the solution @xmath35 the lightest higgs - boson @xmath0 couplings to fermions are equal to the standard model , except that for up - type fermions the sign is opposite .",
    "and @xmath41 of 2hdm  ( ii ) : @xmath53 . ] in such a case , the two - gluon partial width , @xmath54 , dominated by the top - quark loop contribution , is very close to the sm predictions .    .",

    "we expect that , i.e. @xmath59 at lhc could indicate no deviations from sm , , deviations of more than 10% from sm predictions ( on the number of @xmath57 and @xmath1 decays ) are only expected for @xmath60 , i.e. for @xmath61 . ] and at the same time sizable effect can appear at lc ( eg . in higgsstrahlung process @xmath62 ) . also one can expect large deviations from the sm prediction in the two photon width @xmath63 and phase @xmath64 which can be measured at the photon collider , as described below .",
    "finally we note that when the higgs boson coupling to v vanishes , so does the corresponding branching ratio and the sensitivity of the considered measurements is lost .",
    "this is a reason why the determination of @xmath6 from measurement of @xmath0 production and decays to @xmath2 and @xmath7 is not possible for @xmath65 .      in the standard model ,",
    "the dominant contributions to the @xmath36 coupling are due to the @xmath21 and top - quark loops .",
    "therefore , the process of resonant higgs boson production at the photon collider is sensitive to the higgs - boson couplings to the gauge - bosons .",
    "moreover , as the phase of the @xmath21 contributions to the @xmath67 amplitude differs from that of the top loop contribution , not only the two - photon partial width  is sensitive to the the higgs boson coupling , but also the phase .",
    "both parameters can be precisely measured at the photon collider ( see section [ sec : width ] ) , allowing us to constrain the values of @xmath68 and @xmath6 from the combined measurement of @xmath2 and @xmath7 invariant - mass distributions .",
    "an important observation is that the ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath3 branching ratios to the vector bosons , br@xmath69/br@xmath70 does not depend on the @xmath11 value and for a given higgs - boson mass it is expected to be the same as in the standard model .    for @xmath48 one",

    "nevertheless , one expects significant deviations from the standard model predictions for a light higgs - boson @xmath0 , both for the two - photon width and phase , since as compared to the sm there is a change of a relative sign of the top - quark and the @xmath72 contributions . in 2hdm ii ( sol .",
    "@xmath35 ) the two - photon width is significantly larger than in the standard model , where these two contributions partly cancel each other . for @xmath73",

    "finally , for large values of @xmath6 ( @xmath75 ) , the two - photon width of the light higgs - boson @xmath0 tends to be close to the expectations of the standard model , since the only difference is due to the presence of the heavy charged higgs - boson in the loop .",
