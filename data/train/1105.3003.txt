    "dissipative structures ,  patterns in spatially extended systems away from equilibrium have been intensively studied for many decades . a very comprehensive review can be found in @xcite ; results obtained since then would probably require an even more extensive review . a very popular class of mathematical models is the reaction - diffusion systems with diagonal diffusion matrices .",
    "there have been numerous indications that non - diagonal elements in diffusion matrices ,  cross - diffusion , can lead to new nontrivial effects not observed in classical reaction - diffusion systems ,  _ quasi - solitons _ in systems with excitable reaction part @xcite .",
    "the defining features of the quasi - solitons was their ability to penetrate each other , which makes them akin to the true solitons in the conservative systems .",
    "however the question remained whether this similarity is a reflection of common mechanisms , or is entirely superficial and incidental . here",
    "we report an observation which makes the similarity even more striking .",
    "namely , the previously reported quasi - solitons propagated while retaining fixed shape profile ,  were constant solutions in a co - moving frame of reference ; the exceptions were the `` ageing '' quasi - solitons reported in @xcite which retained their front and tail structures but changed their overall length .",
    "here we report `` envelope quasi - solitons '' ( eqs ) , which share some phenomenology with envelope solitons in the nonlinear schroedinger equation  @xcite .",
    "namely , they have the form of spatiotemporal oscillations ( `` wavelets '' ) with a smooth envelope , and the velocity of the individual wavelets ( the phase velocity ) is different from the velocity of the envelope ( the group velocity ) .",
    "this may be a serious evidence for some deep relationship between these phenomena from dissipative and conservative realms .",
    "our observations are made in two two - component models , supplemented with cross - diffusion , rather than self - diffusion terms ; such terms may appear say in mechanical  @xcite , chemical  @xcite , or ecological  @xcite applications : @xmath0 we consider the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) kinetics taken in the form @xmath1 as an archetypal excitable model , with an arbitrarily fixed value of parameter @xmath2 , and varied values of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as a specific example of a real - life system",
    ", we also consider the lengyel - epstein  @xcite ( le ) model of chlorite - iodide - malonic acid - starch autocatalitic reaction system , @xmath5 for fixed @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , solution propagates rightwards . ( a - c ) development of a quasi - soliton .",
    "( d , e ) propagation of a quasi - soliton , with unchanged envelope and shifting phase of high - frequency wavelets within the envelope .",
    "note that wavelets in ( d ) and ( e ) are in antiphase : the @xmath16 profile at @xmath17 is near a local minimum in ( d ) and a local maximum in ( e ) . ]",
    "[ fig : prof ] illustrates development and subsequent propagation of an envelope quasi - soliton ( eqs ) solution in ( [ rxd],[fhn ] ) .",
    "the profiles are presented in a co - moving frame of reference , with @xmath18-coordinate measured with respect to the `` centre of mass '' @xmath19 of the quasi - soliton  @xcite .",
    "simulations with different initial conditions show that as long as the initial perturbation is above a threshold , the amplitude and overall shape of the quasi - soliton does not depend on its details .",
    "an important feature , evident from comparing panels ( d ) and ( e ) , is that whereas the overall shape ( the envelope ) of the quasi - soliton and the wavelength of the high - frequency oscillations ( the wavelets ) within that envelope remain unchanged , the phase of the the wavelets relative to the envelope position changes , so the phase velocity ( of the wavelets ) is different from the group velocity ( of the envelope ) .",
    "this feature can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : density](b ) .",
    "the thin stripes in the density plot represent individual wavelets , and the broader band , consisting of these stripes , represents the envelope .",
    "the slope of the stripes is the inverse of the phase velocity , and the slope of the band is the inverse of the group velocity .",
    "the stripes are not parallel to the band , because the group and the phase velocities differ .",
    "this figure also illustrates another important phenomenon : the reflection of the quasi - soliton from the boundary .      in panel ( a ) , we still see individual wavelet stripes that are not parallel to the envelope bands , but there are two bands in the incident wave . note that the reflected wave only has one band ; however if that reflected band is allowed to propagate for a sufficiently long time , it will spawn its twin band behind it",
    "this is a `` multiplying '' eqs .",
    "we do not go further into properties of these solutions , reserving that for a future study .    in panel",
    "( c ) there is only one dominant stripe and many weaker stripes , all of which are parallel to the band .",
    "this solution has phenomenological features similar to quasi - solitons described previously ,  in  @xcite , namely , the wave retains constant shape as it propagates , and reflects from a boundary .",
    "[ fig : areas ] gives an overview of the parametric area of the eqs solutions in ( [ rxd],[fhn ] ) and its neighbours . in panel",
    "( b ) , the parameter sets at which eqs solutions like the one shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : density](b ) have been observed , are designated by red solid circles .",
    "this area is surrounded :    * at higher and lower values of @xmath4 , by solutions which have similar shape to those shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : density](b ) , but do not reflect from boundaries ( ` annihilating ' , blue crosses ) ; * at lower values of @xmath3 , by multiplying eqss , one of which is illustrated in  fig .",
    "[ fig : density](a ) ( ` multiplying ' , green stars ) ; * at higher values of @xmath3 , by constant shape quasi - solitons , such as the one shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : density](c ) ( ` constant ' , magenta triangles ) .",
    "the area of existence of all these solutions in the @xmath20 parametric plane is bounded from above and from the right , and beyond it our initial conditions did not produce any stably propagating solutions ( ` decaying ' , black open circles ) .",
    "panel ( a ) in this figure illustrates the variability of the shape of eqs within their parametric domain .",
    "most important conclusion from  fig .",
    "[ fig : areas ] is that the eqss are not a unique feature of a special set of parameters but are observed in a rather broad parametric area .    the oscillatory character of the fronts of cross - diffusion waves , described in numerical simulations  @xcite and analysed theoretically in  @xcite , was for waves of stationary shape .",
    "although the proper theory of the eqss is beyond the scope of this letter , the analysis of their non - stationary front structure is easily achieved via linearization of .",
    "the resting states in both fhn   and le   kinetics are stable foci which already shows propensity to oscillations . considering in more detail the fhn kinetics , for small @xmath21 , the solution has the form @xmath22 } \\approx { \\mathop{\\mathrm{re}}\\left (       { c}{{\\mathbf{v}}}{e}^{-{\\mu}({x}-{c}{t } ) } { e}^{{i}({k}{x}-{\\omega}{t } ) }     \\right ) } ,                                                         \\label{fit}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 } , \\;{\\lambda}= { \\mu}{c}-{i}{\\omega},\\;{\\nu}= -{\\mu}+{i}{k}.                                                              \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      fitting of the @xmath11-component of a solution shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] to   gives @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which satisfies   to 3 s.f .",
    "@xcite the quality of the fitting is illustrated in  fig .",
    "[ fig : front ] .",
    "note that the phase velocity of the wavelets here is @xmath28 , smaller than the group velocity , @xmath29 , which agrees with the fact that the slope of the individual stripes in fig .",
    "[ fig : density](b ) ( which is the inverse of the phase velocity @xmath30 ) is steeper than the slope of the band ( which is the inverse of the group velocity @xmath31 ) .",
    "the shape of the profiles in  fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] is reminiscent of localized states in the generalized swift - hohenberg equation with `` snakes and ladders '' bifurcation diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the essential difference of our solutions is that they move and do not preserve their shape , so can not be immediately studied by ode bifurcation techniques .",
    "the defining features of the eqss described above are similar to envelope solitons of the nonlinear schrdinger equation . the version of this equation known as ` nls+ '  @xcite , can be written in the form @xmath32 for a complex field @xmath33 , which presents a reaction - cross - diffusion system for two real fields @xmath34 and @xmath16 via @xmath35 of the form   with @xmath36 system  ( [ rxd],[nlssys ] ) has soliton solutions in the form of ( fast ) harmonic waves with a unimodal ( @xmath37-shaped ) envelope , and the propagation velocity of the envelope ( the group velocity ) is different from the propagation velocity of the wavelets ( the phase velocity ) .",
    "hence one might think of possible interpretation of the eqss in ( [ rxd],[fhn ] ) or ( [ rxd],[le ] ) as a result of a non - conservative perturbation of the envelope solitons in , which would select particular values of the otherwise arbitrary amplitude and speed of the soliton and modify its shape .",
    "this interpretation , however , does not seem to work , and our attempts to connect the solutions in ( [ rxd],[nlssys ] ) and ( [ rxd],[fhn ] ) via a one - parametric family of systems have been unsuccessful , as the eqs solutions disappeared during parameter continuation .",
    "the apparent reason is that the sense of rotation of solutions of in the @xmath38 is clockwise whereas in and it is counterclockwise , and the variant of with counterclockwise rotation , the ` nls- ' equation , does not have envelope soliton solutions .",
    "another comparison can be made with `` wave packets '' reported by vanag and epstein in microemulsion bz reaction , and corresponding mathematical models , associated with finite - wavelength instability of an equilibrium in a reaction - diffusion system with unequal self - diffusion coefficients  @xcite .",
    "they considered two distinct types of solutions : small- and large - amplitude wave packets ( sawp and lawp ) , both capable of reflection from boundaries .",
    "sawp are observed in the nearly - linear regime , they have the phase speed ( of the wavelets ) different from the group speed ( of the envelope , or the packet ) . however , being near to a linear instability and having no stabilizing effect of the dispersion as in nls+ , the packets slowly grow both in amplitude and in width , they are not quasi - solitons .",
    "the lawp , on the contrary , have fixed amplitude and width , but their phase and group velocities coincide , so they retain constant shape .",
    "they are therefore phenomenologically similar to the quasi - solitons reported in excitable systems with cross - diffusion  @xcite .",
    "note that adiabatic elimination of a fast component in a reaction - diffusion system with very different self - diffusion coefficients is one of the ways in which cross - diffusion terms may appear  @xcite , so this analogy deserves further investigation .",
    "to conclude , the solutions we have reported resemble nls+ envelope solitons by their morphology and by their ability to reflect from boundaries , however they are different in that amplitudes and speeds of nls solitons depend on initial conditions , while in they are fixed by parameters of the models .",
    "the reported solution are similar to quasi - solitons reported earlier in that they share the fixed amplitude and reflection properties , but different in that they do not preserve constant shape as their phase velocities are different from their group velocities .",
    "hence we believe this is a new nonlinear phenomenon not seen before .",
    "the mechanisms behind the key properties of this new type of solutions require further investigation , however it is already clear that this is not simply a non - conservative perturbation of nls ."
