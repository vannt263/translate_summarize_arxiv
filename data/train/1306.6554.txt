    "spacetimes of the kundt class are defined by a purely geometric property , namely that they admit a geodesic null congruence which is non - expanding , non - twisting and shear - free . in the context of four - dimensional general relativity ,",
    "such vacuum and pure radiation spacetimes of type  n , iii , or  o were introduced and initially studied 50  years ago by wolfgang kundt @xcite .",
    "the whole kundt class is , in fact , much wider .",
    "it admits a cosmological constant , electromagnetic field , other matter fields and supersymmetry .",

    "it contains several famous subclasses , both in four and higher number of dimensions , with interesting mathematical and physical properties .",
    "the best - known of these are pp - waves ( see @xcite and references therein ) which admit a covariantly constant null vector field .",
    "there are also vsi and csi spacetimes @xcite for which all polynomial scalar invariants constructed from the riemann tensor and its derivatives vanish and are constant , respectively . moreover , all the relativistic gyratons known so far @xcite , representing the fields of localised spinning sources that propagate with the speed of light , are also specific members of the kundt class .",
