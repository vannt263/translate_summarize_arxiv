    "the koto collaboration measured the @xmath2 flux and the momentum spectrum by reconstructing the charged decay modes @xmath13 and @xmath14 in beam surveys with dedicated tracking detectors and calorimeters  @xcite . during data acquisition , the @xmath2 flux is measured using the neutral decay modes @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , since the koto detector can not measure the momentum of charged pions . in this paper",
