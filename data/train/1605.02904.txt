    "the question of the geometric properties ( positions , orientations and shapes ) of cosmic objects concerns every field of astrophysics , from galaxies to gas / dust filaments , binary stars to planet rings , accreting stellar mass black holes to ionized protoplanetary disks ( proplyds ) . to figure out the composition , morphology and kinematics of a source , determining its three - dimensional geometry with respect to the observer is mandatory .",
    "it leads to understanding complex line profiles such as double - peaked balmer lines in agn @xcite , the absolute orientation of the binary orbit of extremely massive stars @xcite , or the structure of keplerian disks around classical be stars @xcite . without measuring and understanding the importance of inclination , dilemma such as the apparent superluminal ( faster - than - light ) motion in quasi - stellar objects ( see e.g. , @xcite ) would still hold .",
    "@xcite was the first to predict the possibility of superluminal motion in quasars , a result of high bulk lorentz factor jets viewed at angles very close to the line - of - sight , i.e. , blazars .",
    "this effect has been detected and studied thoroughly afterwards , and the importance of doppler orientation bias was highlighted by @xcite .",
    "measuring the inclination of the observed target is important but not always easy nor direct .",
    "the powerful radiation processes occurring in quasars @xcite , galaxies @xcite ) and gamma - ray bursts @xcite allow the detection of distant astronomical sources but their internal structure is almost completely unresolved .",
    "focusing on the most stable emitters ( quasars ) , the host galaxy around their central luminous core may be detected , but the host galaxy s inclination does not necessarily correspond to the inclination of the nucleus @xcite . in the nearby universe , it was found that type-1 agn preferentially reside in pole - on on galaxies , but type-2 systems presumably reside in galaxies with a random orientation @xcite , even though optically selected type-2 agn samples tend to avoid edge - on systems @xcite . historically , it is possible to estimate whether the agn we detect are type-1 or type-2 objects through optical classification , the difference relying on the presence / absence of broad balmer lines in the total flux @xcite .",
    "a type-2 lacks those broad emission lines due to dust obscuration along the observer s line - of - sight ; the system is most probably seen at an equatorial viewing angle .",
    "optical polarization measurements successfully confirmed this hypothesis with the detection of broad balmer lines in polarized flux , indicating that type-2 seyfert galaxies are in fact type-1s seen at a specific angle @xcite , but the exact inclination is almost impossible to determine .    in order to shed light on the growth mechanism of black holes , the physical condition of the early universe and the formation of galaxies , it is vital to understand the true nature of agn , which can not be achieved without the prior knowledge of _ how _ we see them @xcite .",
    "misclassification of an agn type can lead to false interpretations of the physics that govern its internal region @xcite . as an example",
    ", the presence of equatorial structures around a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) can be tested thanks to their spectroscopic signatures in the x - ray , ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical and near - infrared ( ir ) bands .",
    "if their geometry is similar to a disk , their observed line emission should be proportional to the cosine of the disk inclination angle with respect to the observer s line - of - sight ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is a potential method to extract the true inclination of an agn through their emission line properties , but one has to be careful as not all emission lines correlate with orientation .",
    "the boroson & green eigenvector  1 stipulates that the dominant source of variation in the observed properties of low - redshift quasi - stellar objects ( qso ) emission lines is a physical parameter that is not always driven by the viewing angle @xcite .",
    "in particular , the boroson & green eigenvector  1 is anticorrelated with the fe  ii  @xmath14570 strength ( equivalent width and fe  ii / h@xmath2 ratio ) , anticorrelated with the blue asymmetry of the h@xmath2 line , but correlated with [ o  iii ]  @xmath15007 strength ( luminosity and peak ) and h@xmath2 linewidth .",
    "estimating the true inclination ( with reasonable uncertainty ) of seyfert galaxies and quasars is thus challenging , but necessary , to progress beyond the basic assertions of the unified model of agn , such as it was proposed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . to achieve this",
    ", the identification of a good orientation indicator in quasars is crucial .",
    "there are potential indicators to estimate the viewing angle of radio - loud objects @xcite , such as the radio - core dominance parameter @xcite , the continuum optical flux density @xcite , or the luminosity of the narrow - line region ( nlr , @xcite ) . however",
    ", none of these techniques can be applied to radio - quiet agn as they intrinsically miss a relativistic , beamed , parsec scale jet .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the diverse techniques used in literature to estimate the nuclear inclination of radio - quiet seyfert galaxies and to identify the best orientation indicator . to achieve this ,",
    "the catalog of inclinations used in the sample is described in sect .",
    "[ comp ] , together with the four main seyfert inclination indicators .",
    "the key question is how well a candidate inclination indicator separates the seyfert 1s from the seyfert 2s .",
    "this is investigated in sect .  [ exploiting ] , where the orientation indicators are compared with inclination - dependent observables .",
    "the existence of statistically significant correlations is investigated using efficient rank correlation statistics ; the evidence for the unified model is very strong , and while it does not require for an inclination indicator to separate the two types perfectly , a near - perfect separation is unlikely to be a coincidence , suggesting a very good indicator .",
    "results and limits are then discussed in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] , and sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] concludes the paper by listing the most important outcomes of the comparisons .",
    "since the goal of this paper is to achieve a comparison between different orientation indicators , the existence of quantitative evaluations of agn inclinations is the main driver of the selection process . only seyfert galaxies with estimated inclinations were selected , regardless of their redshift , black hole mass , bolometric luminosity , accretion rate or any spectroscopic features .",
    "roughly 161 agn inclination values were found during data mining , among which 37 are duplicates . in total ,",
    "124 unique radio - quiet objects have an inclination estimation reported in tab .",
    "[ table : data ] .",
    "this table only accounts for one inclination per agn ; in the case of multiple values , the most probable orientation angle was kept and duplicates were rejected according to two criteria : 1 ) if the uncertainty of the inclination is larger than 25@xmath3 , the inclination is discarded since it would cover the whole permitted range of inclination for a given agn type , and 2 ) in the case of two different inclinations referring to the same object , the value with the uncertainty encompassing the less constraint inclination was chosen in order to be conservative .",
    "the details of the selected / rejected inclinations are given in @xcite .",
    "almost all these inclination values belong to one of the four main categories of orientation indicators that have emerged while collecting these data .",
    "they are classified based on the different mechanisms they use to extract an orientation parameter from their sets of observations and are listed in tab .",
    "[ table : vel ] , [ table : x ] , [ table : ir ] , and [ table : nlr ] .",
    "the duplicates will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ discussion : duplicates ] , while the four classes of inclination indicators are reviewed in the following subsections . a fifth class , gathering all the inclinations emerging from singular techniques that were employed in isolated papers ,",
    "is also mentioned for completeness .",
    "the m-@xmath4 relationship ( or m@xmath5-@xmath4 ) is an empirical , significantly tight , correlation between the velocity dispersion @xmath4 measured in the bulb of a galaxy and the mass of the supermassive black hole situated at the center of this galaxy found @xcite . in a limited number of agn",
    ", the smbh mass can be retrieved thanks to reverberation mapping techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the mass of the compact source can be estimated from the broad line region ( blr ) size and the characteristic velocity of low ionization , broad , emission lines ( lil , such as h@xmath6 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath7 , he  i or he  ii ) .",
    "this velocity , determined by the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the emission line , is strongly dependent on the inclination of the blr .",
    "thus , by assuming a keplerian motion of the lil blr and a similar m-@xmath4 relationship between seyfert-1s and regular galaxies , @xcite and @xcite estimated the orientation angles @xmath8 for a variety of type-1 agn with known black hole masses and measured fwhm . this resulted in 19 unique inclination estimations , reported in tab .",
    "[ table : vel ] .",
    "note that the technique , requiring the measurement of the fwhm of low ionization broad emission lines , is intrinsically limited to type-1 objects .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy is a valuable tool that can probe the few inner gravitational radii around a singularity . in agn , an accretion disk around the smbh @xcite acts like a mirror reflecting / absorbing part of the x - ray radiation",
    "that is isotropically produced by a hot corona situated above the disk .",
    "the corona up - scatters thermally emitted , ultraviolet ( uv ) , disk photons to higher energies @xcite , producing the observed power - law spectrum .",
    "the intense gravitational field around the potential well will affect the re - emitted disk fluorescent emission by broadening the lines due to doppler effects and gravitational plus transverse redshifts .",
    "it will result in a strong asymmetrically blurred emission feature at 6.4  kev , associated with iron fluorescence in near - neutral material @xcite .",
    "since this fluorescent line is emitted in a disk , its line width will be characteristic of the inclination of the system . by applying x - ray",
    "spectral fits accounting for a non - euclidean space time , it becomes possible to constrain the orientation of the accretion disk , which is usually tied to the agn inclination @xcite .",
    "however , this technique is intrinsically limited to bright agn .",
    "the compilation of x - ray fitted agn inclination results in 54 unique objects reported in tab .",
    "[ table : x ] .",
    "agn act like calorimeters @xcite . by absorbing the optical and uv light thermally produced by the accretion disk , the dust embedding the nuclear region will be heated and will re - emit the stored energy at larger wavelengths , principally in the mid - infrared ( mir ) .",
    "the fact that agn are surrounded by an asymmetrically distributed amount of dust grains , with a predominance of dust along the equatorial region ( the seminal dusty torus ) , allows a determination of the inclination of the mir emitting region by looking at the amount of re - emitted radiation and the spectral features in the nir and mir spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to achieve this ,",
    "clumpy torus models are applied to observed data in order to retrieve several characteristics ( such as the spectral energy distribution , sed , or emission and absorption features ) .",
    "detailed fitting procedures , such as masking the emission lines and the telluric band region @xcite , or implementing more complex reprocessing geometries @xcite , also help to better estimate the inclination of the torus . in total ,",
    "37 individual objects have been observed and modeled , and the final compilation of inclination values is listed in tab .  [ table : ir ] .",
    "nasa / esa hubble space telescope observations of the radial velocities of the [ o  iii]-emitting gas in a sample of nearby seyfert galaxies ( e.g. ngc  4151 by @xcite or ngc  1068 by @xcite ) have shown that the kinematics of the extended narrow line region ( nlr ) of agn tend to be dominated by radial outflows in the approximate morphology of an hourglass . by matching several observed radial velocities to their kinematic model",
    ", @xcite postulated that the orientation of the agn nuclei could be determined from kinematic mapping .",
    "this work was undertaken by @xcite , who used [ o  iii ] imaging and long - slit spectra of 53 seyfert galaxies to extract the inclination of the bicone axis , and hence of the obscuring torus . using uniform , hollow , bi - conical models with sharp edges",
    ", @xcite found that out of the 53 agn they observed , 17 objects had clear enough signatures to retrieve their potential inclination .",
    "those 17 objects are listed in tab .",
    "[ table : nlr ] .",
    "note that , to be able to retrieve an inclination , this technique requires bright , nearby agn with resolved nlr structures .      under the label",
    "`` other '' are gathered all the techniques used by a variety of authors to estimate the inclination from one , seldomly more , object(s ) .",
    "it includes spectropolarimetric observations and modeling of highly polarized type-1 objects such as eso  323-g077 @xcite or fairall  51 @xcite , fits of the observed broad , double - peaked balmer emission lines in ngc  1097 @xcite using an eccentric accretion ring model , and several other techniques that are detailed in @xcite .",
    "the inclinations derived from this mix of approaches are included in tab .",
    "[ table : data ] and contain 25 seyfert galaxies .",
    "since those orientation indicators do not share a common method , the inclinations listed as `` other '' will only be used in the global sample .     in total , there are four main indicators : m-@xmath4 relationship , x - ray reflection spectroscopy , ir modeling , and [ o  iii]-mapping .",
    "interestingly these four methods focus on different and distinct physical scales . in increasing radial distance from the central supermassive black hole : 1 ) the x - ray method probes the inclination of the inner part of the accretion disk at a couple of gravitational radii @xcite , 2 ) the m-@xmath4 indicator focuses on the blr emission , spanning from 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath10  pc , @xcite , 3 ) the ir method models the dusty torus whose radius is estimated between 10@xmath10 and 10@xmath11  pc @xcite , and 4 ) the [ o  iii ] kinematic modeling of the nlr probes physical scales ranging from a parsec up to hundreds of parsecs @xcite . a color - coded sketch of the unified model is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme ] in order to show the different agn components targeted by those inclination indicators .",
    "it becomes clear that the concept of a global agn orientation angle is a complicated matter , as the four indicators are meant to measure the inclination of separate components . in the following ,",
    "the reader is cautioned to remember that the investigations are intended to see if the inclination derived for a given region ( x - ray : innermost agn components , m-@xmath4 : blr , ir fitting : torus , and [ o  iii]-mapping : nlr ) can be valid over a wider range of physical scales ."
