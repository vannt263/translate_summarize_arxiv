    "the elucidation of phase structure is a major theme in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics .",
    "an early paradigm for doing so , associated most with landau , characterizes phases through the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries present in the microscopic hamiltonian _ i.e _ , phases are either paramagnetic , or spontaneously symmetry broken ( ssb ) . in modern parlance , the phases obtained thereby are symmetry protected since their distinctions are erased if the symmetries are not present microscopically .",
    "more recently , it has been found that this characterization is too coarse  not all paramagnetic phases should be considered identical .",
    "indeed , there exist paramagnetic symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phases which do not break any symmetries , but which nevertheless can not be adiabatically connected to one another in the presence of the protecting global symmetry@xcite .",
    "remarkably , we now know of other phases , such as those with topological order , which do not even require a global symmetry and are _ absolutely stable_their ground state ( and sometimes even low temperature ) properties are stable to arbitrary weak local perturbations@xcite . equally remarkably , there are also examples of systems whose entire many body spectrum displays some absolutely stable property , namely many body localized @xcite ( mbl ) systems which robustly exhibit a full set of emergent local conserved quantities@xcite",
    ". one can also combine mbl with the above quantum orders to obtain mbl phases in which individual highly excited eigenstates show ssb , spt , or topological order@xcite .    ) and antiunitary ( @xmath0 ) symmetries .",
    "special models ( black stars ) can lie at the intersection of several sub - manifolds with exact symmetries .",
    "as an example , the @xmath1sg model defined in refs .   is absolutely stable and possesses the ising unitary symmetry @xmath2 and an antiunitary symmetry @xmath3 where @xmath4 is complex conjugation .",
    "( b ) schematic depiction of the spatiotemporal long - range order found in absolutely stable phases  the order looks `` antiferromagnetic '' in time and glassy in space . ]    the ideas above assume time translation invariance ( tti ) or energy conservation since they involve describing the eigensystem of a time independent many body hamiltonian .",
    "what happens if we relax this constraint , considering instead time dependent hamiltonians @xmath5 ?",
    "generically , it is expected that an interacting , driven many - body system absorbs energy indefinitely and approaches a dynamic approximation to the infinite temperature equilibrium state . however , for floquet systems with periodic time dependence @xmath6 , this fate can be avoided in the presence of sufficiently strong disorder ( or in the absence of interactions@xcite ) as was shown in recent work extending the physics of mbl to floquet systems@xcite .",
    "this in turn allowed phases to be defined for mbl - floquet systems@xcite via a generalization of the idea of eigenstate order first discussed for undriven mbl systems .",
    "in very recent work , a classification was given for phases that either preserve@xcite or spontaneously break@xcite unitary global symmetries .",
    "in the present paper we build on the latter work and show that a subset of the ssb phases identified therein are stable to arbitrary weak local perturbations , including those that explicitly break any of the defining global symmetries . thus this subset is _ absolutely _ stable  a remarkable outcome for a driven system . the apparent puzzle that ssb phases can be stable absent hamiltonian independent symmetries",
    "is resolved elegantly : at general points in these absolutely stable phases , the drives ( in the infinite volume limit ) are characterized by a set of hamiltonian _ dependent _ emergent unitary and antiunitary symmetries .",
    "_ ex post facto _ , we see that the symmetric models in refs .   live in lower dimensional submanifolds",
    "( characterized by hamiltonian independent symmetries ) of a much higher dimensional absolutely stable phase  we sketch the resulting structure in fig .",
    "[ manifolds ] .",
    "this analysis uncovers a much richer symmetry structure than the global unitary symmetries used in previous work .",
    "strikingly , the out of equilibrium dynamics in these phases exhibits sharp universal signatures associated with oscillations of an emergent order parameter ; these generalize the multiple period oscillations uncovered in previous work @xcite on symmetric drives .",
    "for example , we show that starting from arbitrary short range correlated initial states , the late time states show sharp oscillations of generic local operators at multiples of the fundamental period .",
    "this particular dynamical feature is a great boon to a future experimental detection of these phases as experimentalists are required neither to fine tune the hamiltonian nor the starting state to observe a sharp signature !",
    "these longer periods raise the question of whether they should be thought of as representing spontaneous breaking of yet another symmetry  that of time translations by a period of the drive .",
    "we note that the idea that time translations might be analyzed in this fashion was first mooted by wilczek @xcite for time independent hamiltonians ; there is , however , now a proof @xcite that such `` time crystals '' do not exist for undriven systems in equilibrium .",
    "we analyze this question further and find that strictly speaking _ all _ mbl systems , driven or undriven , exhibit some eigenstate correlations characteristic of temporal _",
    "glasses_an aperiodic breaking of time translation invariance ( tti ) . for the floquet",
    "broken symmetry phases however , the long distance correlations simultaneously exhibit spin glass order in space and multiple period oscillation in time .",
    "these lead to the characteristic space - time snapshot illustrated for the simplest such phase in ( b ) . evidently the system exhibits spatiotemporal long - range order in both space and time .",
    "the modulation in time , which is antiferromagnetic , does indeed break time translation symmetry but it preserves the combination of a translation and emergent ising reversal .",
    "we note that a similar spatiotemporal order  now ferromagnetic in space  was previously exhibited in the large @xmath7 floquet theory @xcite and discussed in the terminology of a lack of synchronization with the drive .",
    "we note that the discovery of these absolutely stable floquet phases can also be viewed as the realization that while a hamiltonian that lacks _ any _ symmetries ( inclusive of time translation invariance ) exhibits only a trivial phase , introducing discrete time translation invariance _",
    "alone _ is sufficient to introduce a non - trivial phase structure .",
    "this would appear to be the minimum symmetry condition for this purpose .",
    "in the rest of the paper we describe these results in more detail .",
    "we begin with the simplest example of a ssb phase that is absolutely stable  this is the ising @xmath1 spin - glass or @xmath1sg first described in refs .  .",
    "in we establish its absolute stability and analyze its emergent symmetries , correlations and characteristic spectral features within the paradigm of eigenstate order .",
    "next , in we study the nature of dynamical correlations in the @xmath1sg in individual eigenstates and starting from generic short ranged entangled states , and discuss why the @xmath1sg should be identified as a floquet space - time crystal .",
    "we then discuss the catalog of other absolutely stable floquet phases in , and show how some floquet spt phases exhibit time crystallinity at their boundaries .",
    "we end with some concluding remarks in .    before proceeding we note that a recent paper by else , bauer and nayak @xcite studies one of the submanifolds of our primary example of an absolutely stable phase , the @xmath1sg and identifies it as a pure time crystal on the grounds that the drives break the unitary ising symmetry .",
    "our work clarifies that the order in the @xmath1sg and its cousins is always spatiotemporal and never purely temporal .",
    "indeed the specific submanifold studied in @xcite turns out to be protected by an antiunitary symmetry ( see ) and thus exhibits spatial order in a particularly transparent form as we discuss below .",
    "we consider systems with time periodic local hamiltonians @xmath8 .",
    "the floquet unitary is the time evolution operator for one period @xmath9 .",
    "the floquet eigenstates @xmath10 of @xmath11 have eigenvalues @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are the quasienergies defined modulo @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , the floquet eigensystem in phases with special forms of eigenstate order / quasienergy spectral pairing will form a central part of our discussion .      refs .   discussed various ssb / spt phases with floquet eigenstate order , but not all of these phases are absolutely stable to arbitrary perturbations . in this work",
    ", our canonical example of an absolutely stable floquet phase will be the @xmath1 spin - glass ( @xmath1sg ) phase@xcite .",

    "it similarly has @xmath28 symmetry for systems with an even number of sites .",
    "thus , this model lies at the intersection of several special submanifolds with hamiltonian independent symmetries ( fig .",
    "[ manifolds ] ) and is extremely robust to a large class of perturbations which preserve _ some _ exact symmetry .",
    "note that the anti - unitary symmetries @xmath29 are a combination of @xmath4 and a spatial ising flip .",
    "the eigenspectrum of @xmath24 can be found by noting that all the domain wall operators @xmath30 commute with @xmath31 , @xmath24 and with one another .",
    "thus , the eigenstates look like symmetric / antisymmetric global superposition states ( also called cat states ) of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 labels a frozen spin - glass configuration of @xmath34 spins ( and hence the domain wall expectation values @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 is its spin - flipped partner , and @xmath37 is the ising parity eigenvalue of the eigenstates .",
    "the eigenstates above have corresponding unitary eigenvalues @xmath38 .",
    "note that the opposite parity cat - state partners have unitary eigenvalues differing by a minus sign @xmath39 and hence quasienergies differing by @xmath40 .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon as a @xmath1 spectral pairing of cat states .",
    "the floquet eigenstates exhibit long range connected correlations ( lro ) and spin glass@xcite ( sg ) order in @xmath41 , but show no long - range order in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "5 .   the order parameter for the @xmath1sg model oscillates with frequency @xmath40 or period @xmath44 , as indicated by the stroboscopic equation of motion @xmath45@xcite .",
    "this follows directly from the fact that @xmath46 anticommutes with @xmath24 . while @xmath47 in the floquet eigenstates , the observable shows a periodic time dependence with period @xmath44 in short - range correlated states of the form @xmath48 . on the other hand , the @xmath49 and @xmath50 operators do not show period @xmath44 oscillations .",
    "how robust are the above properties to perturbations of the form @xmath51 ?",
    "numerical results have already demonstrated the stability of @xmath24 to weak ising @xcite symmetric perturbations .",
    "we will provide evidence that this phase is , in fact , absolutely stable to _ all _ generic weak perturbations  we will define dressed spin operators ( floquet l - bits ) for the perturbed system and show that it displays _ emergent _ symmetries with the same effect on eigenspectrum properties as the exact ising symmetry .    the first step in the argument is to observe that the stability of the localization of the unperturbed unitary to arbitrary weak local perturbations ( for sufficiently strong disorder ) is itself not a consequence of symmetries .",
    "more technically , call the corresponding perturbed floquet unitary @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the strength of the perturbation .",
    "we expect that the stability of localization implies the existence of a family of local unitaries for some local bounded hamiltonian @xmath54 , with @xmath55 finite in the thermodynamic limit . ] @xmath56 which relate the eigenvectors of @xmath24 to those of @xmath52 for @xmath53 in some non - vanishing range @xcite .",
    "note that the locality of such a unitary is a subtle business outside of the very strongly localized region due to proliferating resonances and griffiths effects@xcite .    assuming that a low depth @xmath56 exists , it relates the new eigenvectors of @xmath52 denoted @xmath57 to the eigenvectors of @xmath24 via @xmath58 the new quasienergies are similarly denoted as @xmath59 .",

    "further we show in that it also anticommutes with @xmath52 in the large system limit [ eq : tauac ] [ _ r^z , u_f ] _ + = o(e^-c l ) 0 using only the assumptions of locality and continuity .",
    "this implies that the floquet eigenvalues are odd in @xmath72 . together with the previous statements about the commutation properties of @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath52 , it is easy to show that the unitary eigenvalues take the form @xmath75 .",
    "re - expressing the eigenvalue dependence on conserved quantities in operator language gives [ eq : ufcanonical ] u_f = p^ e^-if(\\ { d^_r } ) where @xmath76 is a functional of @xmath74 , or equivalently an even functional of the @xmath77 s .",
    "one can moreover argue that @xmath76 can be chosen to be local , using the fact that the floquet unitary itself is low depth@xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath76 generically takes the form @xmath78 where the couplings @xmath79 decay exponentially with distance reflecting the locality of the unitary .",
    "written this way , the floquet unitary clearly has a @xmath80 symmetry @xmath61  although we say it is emergent because @xmath68 , in general , depends on the details of the underlying hamiltonian .",

    "implicitly this requires us to work in the infinite volume limit directly . in this case",
    ", one can show that @xmath90 commutes ( rather than anticommutes ) with the floquet unitary , and one can readily use this to split the degeneracy between the floquet eigenstates , rendering this phase unstable to arbitrary perturbations . by contrast , in the @xmath1sg phase , the cat states are @xmath1 split and therefore non - degenerate  a fact which is essential to the stability of the ssb order to arbitrary perturbations .",

    "having shown how the robustness of the @xmath1sg phase is associated with spontaneously broken emergent symmetries and long - range order in the @xmath90 variables , we can now ask what effect this long - range order has on correlations in the physical @xmath111 degrees of freedom .",

    "these predictions agree with our numerical results and respectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "when we perturb @xmath24 in a manner that respects an explicit symmetry like @xmath2 or @xmath29 , the resulting models reside in a special submanifold of the absolutely stable phase .",
    "the presence of the exact symmetries constrains the form of the dressed @xmath83 operators and leads to concrete predictions about the order in and temporal dependence of different operators .",
    "for example , it was argued@xcite that when the perturbation @xmath114 is such that @xmath52 continues to have ising symmetry , @xmath89 can be chosen to commute with @xmath2 . as a result , @xmath115 , and @xmath116",
    "are odd under @xmath68 whereas @xmath117 is even under @xmath118 .",

    "this accounts for the absence of @xmath40 oscillations for @xmath135 in the data presented in ref .  .",

    "we start by considering floquet eigenstates for the @xmath1sg .",
    "all single time operators @xmath144 in these are strictly periodic with period @xmath145this is the analog of the time independence of single time operators in hamiltonian eigenstates and hence the temporal component of the order is invisible to such operators .",
    "the invisibility of temporal order in the @xmath144 is analogous to the invisibility of ising symmetry breaking in one point expectations of spatially local ising - odd operators in globally ising symmetric states . from this perspective@xcite",
    "it follows that to detect temporal order we must either ( a ) examine a two time function of some operator or ( b ) explicitly add an infinitesimal field that selects the desired temporal order ( much as we would examine long - range order in two - point functions of ising - odd variables and/or add an infinitesimal ising symmetry breaking term to detect spontaneously broken ising symmetry ) .",
    "we begin with ( a ) and examine time - dependent correlators @xmath146 of operators @xmath147 localized near sites @xmath148 in the floquet eigenstates @xmath149 ( see for notation ) .",
    "the operator expansion of @xmath147 in the @xmath83 basis will generically contain terms that are odd combinations of @xmath90s . in the @xmath1sg phase , these have matrix elements between @xmath10 and its parity flipped partner and thus @xmath150 generically has a frequency @xmath40 component .",
    "in addition , the off - diagonal terms in the operator expansion involving @xmath151 will make local domain wall excitations near sites @xmath152 .",
    "now a crucial point : if @xmath148 are held a fixed distance apart in the infinite volume limit , then @xmath153 breaks tti for _ any _ mbl - floquet system .",
    "the reason is that one can crudely view a floquet mbl system as a set of weakly interacting localized modes ( the effective domain wall operators in this case ) each with their own local spectra .",
    "as in the simplest case of 2-level systems whose physics is that of rabi oscillations , these local subsystems ( which are excited by @xmath154 ) exhibit response at frequencies incommensurate with the driving frequency .",
    "the presence of these incommensurate frequencies means @xmath155 in _ all mbl - floquet systems always look glassy _ , although for the @xmath1sg there is generically also a quantized response at @xmath40 .",
    "this short distance temporal glassiness however goes away when we examine long distances in space by placing the operators arbitrarily far apart in an infinite system , _",
    "i.e. _ , by taking @xmath156 before examining the limit @xmath157 .",
    "since the operator expansions of @xmath147 are exponentially localized near sites @xmath152 , the off - diagonal terms in the expansion of @xmath158 which create domain - wall excitations near site @xmath19 _ can not be annihilated _ by the action of @xmath159 in the limit @xmath157 under the assumption of locality .",
    "thus , the only terms that contribute to @xmath160 in this limit are diagonal in @xmath161s .",
    "terms odd in @xmath161 give a response at @xmath40 while the even terms give a response at frequency @xmath87 .",

    "the dependence of the coefficients on @xmath19 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 has been made explicit to emphasize the glassy nature of the order in space .",
    "this establishes a connection between the long range spatial order in the eigenstates and the period @xmath44 temporal order .",
    "the above analysis can be complemented by taking the approach ( b ) and adding to @xmath5 a `` staggered field '' in time of the form @xmath165 , where @xmath131 is odd and diagonal in @xmath90 .",

    "if averaged over all eigenstates the signatures vanish .",
    "we now turn to the question of evolution from more general initial states rather than eigenstates .",

    "we will adapt the analysis of dephasing in quenches in mbl systems @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the starting state exhibits a non - zero expectation value for the order parameter , i.e. @xmath172 ; if it does not the temporal features will be entirely absent .",

    "it is worth reminding the reader that the precise details of the time dependence will reflect the choice of the starting state and disorder realization .",
    "we can formalize the above in two non - commuting limits : ( a ) @xmath181 and ( b ) @xmath182 .",
    "while ( a ) characterizes the `` intrinsic '' quench dynamics of this phase , experiments will only have access to limit ( b ) . in ( b ) the late time aperiodic oscillations with envelope @xmath180 discussed above",
    "also go away , and the one - point functions are constants . in ( a )",
    "we never reach times of @xmath183 and instead observe persistent oscillations with period @xmath44 out to @xmath184 with all additional incommensurate oscillations decaying away as a power of time .",
    "thus , the intrinsic dynamical response of this phase is characterized by a single quantized fourier peak at @xmath177 which goes along with formally exact spectral pairing at @xmath40 and lro in @xmath90 . in this limit , the late time state exhibits a precisely doubled period for every single realization of disorder and combined space - time measurements would lead precisely to the kind of snapshot sketched in fig .",
    "more concretely , state - of - the - art experiments in ultracold atoms @xcite have convincingly demonstrated that a fingerprint of the initial state persists to asymptotically late times in the mbl phase . in a generalized experimental setup probing the @xmath1sg phase in the mbl floquet problem",
    ", the persistence of the starting fingerprint would measure localization and spatial spin glass order , while oscillations in time would measure the temporal response at @xmath40 .",
    "we also note that a recent experiment demonstrated signatures of mbl in two dimensions@xcite and , more generally , we expect our considerations to apply in all dimensions where mbl exists@xcite .     of one point",
    "time - dependent expectation values @xmath185 in the `` generically '' perturbed model .",
    "the initial state @xmath186 is a product state with physical spins @xmath111 randomly pointing on the bloch sphere and uncorrelated from site to site . as discussed in the text , the response looks `` glassy '' with several incommensurate fourier peaks in the addition to the peak at @xmath40 , although we expect these to decay away in the @xmath187 limit .",
    "data is shown for a single disorder realization in a system of length @xmath188 .",
    "]      in the above discussion we have considered two settings , that of floquet eigenstates and of late time states stemming from quenches .",
    "it is useful to contrast our findings with their analogs for general mbl phases ( floquet or undriven ) , and for eth obeying phases ( focussing on the undriven case , as the floquet version has trivial infinite temperature correlations ) .",
    "we find that unequal time correlations in eigenstates generically break tti in all mbl phases , which thus generically look glassy .",
    "by contrast similar correlations in eth systems do _ not _ generically break tti . in the @xmath1sg",
    "we find that eigenstate correlations specifically designed to pick out the order parameter dynamics are `` antiferromagnetic '' in the time domain and thus break tti while they are `` ferromagnetic '' for the @xmath87sg and thus do not .",
    "turning now to the late time states coming from quenches , in mbl phases these are initial state dependent while in eth phases these are not . hence if we look for tti breaking via these late time states we do not observer it in all eth phases as well as mbl phases except the @xmath1sg ( and its relatives which we discuss in the next section ) .",
    "we remind the reader though that in the @xmath1sg we need to quench from states that exhibit a macroscopic expectation value for the order parameter .",
    "all in all we conclude that the @xmath1sg exhibits a distinct and novel pattern of spatiotemporal order that is new to quantum systems .",
    "here we list a number of generalizations of the @xmath1sg phase . ref .   presented a family of models with an explicit global symmetry group @xmath189 which exhibit eigenstate long - range order , protected spectral pairing and temporal crystallinity .",
    "first we note that , much like the @xmath1sg , many of these models are absolutely stable to local perturbations , even those that break the global symmetry @xmath189 .",
    "we then explain why bosonic spt floquet drives@xcite are not stable to the inclusion of symmetry breaking perturbations , although in the presence of the protecting symmetry they exhibit time crystallinity at their edges .",
    "consider first models with global @xmath191 symmetry@xcite .",
    "there are @xmath192 possible phases with completely spontaneously broken symmetry@xcite , labelled by @xmath193 .",
    "the eigenvectors of the corresponding unitary are the @xmath190 equivalents of cat states i.e. , macroscopic superpositions of @xmath192 spin configurations . in cases with @xmath194 , and in the presence of @xmath190 symmetry , the spectrum consists of multiplets of @xmath192 cat states appearing in @xmath195 distinct groups each with degeneracy @xmath196 .",

    "a similar statement holds for the non - abelian models in ref .  .",
    "these more general drives have an explicit unitary non - abelian symmetry @xmath189 , and are classified by an element of the center of the group @xmath199 .",
    "let @xmath200 denote the order of @xmath34 .",
    "the spectrum consists of @xmath200 groups of @xmath201 degenerate cat - like states , and the @xmath200 groups are separated by quasi - energies which are multiples of @xmath202 .",
    "the @xmath203 degeneracy at each quasienergy can once again be lifted using symmetry breaking perturbations , but each eigenstate is still paired with @xmath200 cat state partners , split by quasienergy multiples of @xmath204 .",
    "sg and @xmath1sg phases which are long - range ordered and spontaneously break ising symmetry , as well as the @xmath205pm and trivial paramagnetic phases which have no lro .",
    "the @xmath205pm is an spt with non - trivial edge modes and can spontaneously break time translation symmetry on its edges .",
    "( right ) : on perturbing with generic ising symmetry breaking fields @xmath206 , only the @xmath1sg is absolutely stable and continues into a phase with lro and an emergent symmetry .",
    "the other three phases can be continuously connected to the trivial mbl paramagnet in the presence of @xmath206 . ]      while the @xmath1sg phase is absolutely stable , similar floquet generalizations of bosonic spt phases@xcite are not . before showing this ,",
    "let us first note that some floquet spts spontaneously break tti at their boundaries .",
    "this boundary tti breaking is not tied to bulk lro and the phases are correspondingly _ unstable _ to symmetry breaking perturbations .",
    "we illustrate this with the simple example of an ising floquet spt , the so - called @xmath205pm@xcite .",
    "in fact , the @xmath205pm and @xmath1sg are neighbors on a common floquet phase diagram@xcite ( left ) which also contains the @xmath87sg discussed earlier and a trivial mbl paramagnet .",
    "a simple floquet unitary for @xmath205pm on a system with boundary is @xcite @xmath207,\\ ] ] where the fields @xmath208 are randomly distributed .",
    "this model has trivial bulk paramagnetic eigenstate order , but it also has non - trivial ising odd `` pumped charges '' @xmath209 , using the parlance of ref .  .",
    "as a consequence , the eigenspectrum exhibits `` spectral quadrupling '' . labeling the simultaneous eigenvalues of @xmath210 by @xmath211 , it can be shown that states always appear in multiplets of the form @xmath212 _ i.e. _ , there are two groups of degenerate states split by exactly @xmath40 quasienergy  hence the name @xmath205pm . the @xmath40 quasienergy splitting in @xmath1sg",
    "was associated with the breaking of tti , so it is natural to also expect tti breaking for the @xmath205pm . indeed , for the special model",
    ", the @xmath213 edge operators have stroboscopic equations of motion @xmath214 , with period @xmath44 . at generic points in the @xmath205pm phase",
    "obtained by perturbing with ising symmetric perturbations , dressed versions of these edge pauli operators ( and generic edge operators with non - zero projections on the dressed pauli edge operators ) will exhibit period @xmath44 oscillations persistent for exponentially long time scales in system size ( in the same spirit as ref .  ) .",
    "indeed , using ising duality@xcite , statements about the dynamics of ising even edge operators in the @xmath205pm paramagnet directly translate into statements about local bulk operator dynamics in the ( ising symmetric ) @xmath1sg in .",
    "we emphasize , however , that for @xmath205pm generic local bulk operators will not show period doubling in the limit @xmath95 .    despite the non - trivial dynamics in the @xmath205pm , the spectral pairing properties of this phase ( and the more general bosonic floquet spt phases discussed in ref .  )",
    "are unstable to the inclusion of small , generic symmetry breaking perturbations at the boundary . to see how this works in more generality , note that floquet mbl unitaries can be re - expressed in a certain canonical form@xcite [ eq : canon ] u_f0=v_l v_r e^-",
    "i f where @xmath76 is a local mbl hamiltonian functional of the l - bits in the bulk , and @xmath215 are unitaries localized at the left / right edges of the system respectively which commute with the bulk l - bits .",
    "note that the model is a special realization of this more general canonical form .",
    "the spt order of @xmath24 is captured by two pieces of data : ( i ) the bulk spt order , which is determined by the classification of @xmath76 as an undriven hamiltonian , and ( ii ) the `` pumped charge '' , characterized by the commutation relations between the @xmath215 and the global symmetry generators@xcite . note that can readily be detuned  whilst maintaining locality and unitarity  to a form with trivial pumped charge , @xmath216 , through an interpolating family of unitaries @xmath217 with @xmath53 being tuned from @xmath87 to @xmath218 .",
    "note further that if @xmath215 have non - trivial commutation relations with the global symmetry , this interpolating family of unitaries breaks the global symmetry .",
    "it may still occur that @xmath76 , an mbl hamiltonian , has a non - trivial spt classification and therefore @xmath216 has spectral pairing and edge states .",
    "however , this spt order is readily destroyed by perturbing @xmath76 non - symmetrically as one would perturb an undriven spt so as to gap out its edge states .",
    "this instability of the boundary - tti breaking spt phases reiterates our central message that the absolute stability of a tti breaking phase is intrinsically tied to the coexistence of bulk spatial lro .",
    "the instability of @xmath205pm spt combined with our prior statements on the instability of pairing in the @xmath87sg leads to the picture depicted in ( right)in the presence of generic ising symmetry breaking perturbations , the four ising symmetric mbl - floquet phases are reduced to two : the absolutely stable continuation of the @xmath1sg , and a trivial pm .",
    "the @xmath87sg and the @xmath205pm can be continuously connected to the trivial pm without going through a phase transition in the presence of ising symmetry breaking terms .",
    "we end this section by briefly commenting on the stability of fermionic spts .",
    "interacting spts protected by fermion parity are more robust .",
    "let us focus on class d@xcite for concreteness .",
    "while it is true that edge modes are unstable to fermion parity breaking perturbations , fermion parity is never broken for physical / local hamiltonians @xmath5  hence , in the detuning argument above , @xmath52 is not a truly local unitary for intermediate values of @xmath53 when @xmath215 are fermion parity odd ( we say the pumped charge is fermion parity odd@xcite ) .",
    "however , as with all of the examples discussed here , the floquet edge modes can be removed by breaking time translation symmetry .",
    "we have shown the existence of a family of phases of floquet systems which are absolutely stable  a generic interior point in such a phase is stable to _ all _ weak local perturbations of its governing unitary .",
    "these phases are characterized by emergent , hamiltonian dependent , abelian global symmetries and spatiotemporal long range order based on these .",
    "submanifolds of these phases exhibit hamiltonian independent symmetries which can be unitary or anti - unitary . at generic points in these phases , late time states evolved from randomly picked short ranged entangled states exhibit long range order in space and sharp oscillations of the emergent order parameter which can be used to identify the phases .",
    "these floquet phases join two previously established paradigms for such absolute stability  those of topological order and that of mbl for time independent hamiltonians  and a comparison between these three is in order .",
    "topological order , exemplified by the @xmath219 order of the toric code and its weak local perturbations , is characterized by the absence of symmetry breaking and the presence of emergent gauge fields .",
    "such phases are in a different language quantum liquids with long range ( ground state ) entanglement @xcite which features account intuitively for their absolute stability .    mbl is characterized by a complete set of emergent , hamiltonian dependent , local integrals of the motion ( l - bits ) and in its minimal form involves eigenstates that exhibit only short ranged entanglement .",
    "its absolute stability can be attributed to the localization being unrelated to any spatial ordering ",
    "it is primarily a dynamical phenomenon .",
    "by contrast , broken symmetries are _ not _ absolutely stable  symmetry induced degeneracies are lifted when symmetries are broken .",
    "it is not hard to believe that one can mix topological order and mbl and still end up with an absolutely stable phase and this was discussed as an example of eigenstate order in ref .  .",
    "by contrast it is also natural to conclude that mbl and symmetry breaking to not lead to absolute stability and this is also trivially the case .",
    "what is therefore striking is that a third ingredient , floquet periodicity , allows broken symmetries and mbl to combine to yield absolutely stable phases .",
    "the resulting phases also exhibit long range entanglement in the form of the cat eigenstates and thus are stabilized by a relative of the mechanism which operates in the case of topological order .",
    "finally we note that the absolute stability of symmetry broken phases in this paper can be put on a similar footing to the well known absolute stability of topological phases@xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite characterizes pure abelian gauge theories as spontaneously breaking @xmath218-form global symmetries in their deconfined phases . in the presence of matter , the generators for these higher form symmetries are emergent and thus hamiltonian dependent .",
    "for example , in the perturbed 2d toric code , the 1-form symmetries are generated by dressed line operators@xcite .",
    "more generally , a large class of well known and undriven absolutely stable topologically ordered phases are characterized by spontaneously broken emergent @xmath218-form global symmetries , while the floquet drives in this work are characterized by emergent global ( @xmath87-form ) symmetries . in a related note",
    ", one can consider floquet unitaries constructed from topologically ordered hamiltonians , such as the toric code , which toggle states between different topological sectors .",
    "such drives exhibit spatial topological order , do not break any global symmetries , but do break tti because the floquet unitary described does not commute with operators which measure the topological sector . just as the cat states are split by @xmath40 quasi - energy in the @xmath1sg , different topological sectors are split by @xmath40 in this topological example .",
    "it is somewhat a matter of taste whether these should be identified as floquet time crystals .",
    "we thank j. chalker , a. chandran , a. lazarides , and r. moessner for many useful discussions .",
    "we especially thank e. altman for making the connection to time crystals , d. huse for his comments on dephasing , and s. kivelson for suggesting the term `` absolute stability '' .",
    "cvk is supported by the princeton center for theoretical science .",
    "sls and cvk acknowledge support from the nsf - dmr via grant no .",
    "to prove this assertion , we will use only the locality of the @xmath221 .",
    "first note that we can express a product of any two @xmath222 operators as a product of l - bits @xmath223 .",
    "this compound operator commutes with with @xmath126 because the @xmath67 do , i.e. , [ eq : localityandlbits ] u_f,^z_r,^z_s , u_f,^=^z_r,^z_s , however note that the unitaries defined as @xmath224 are local to @xmath148 respectively .",
    "this follows from two observations .",
    "first @xmath220 is local to @xmath19 because @xmath56 is assumed low depth .",
    "second , @xmath225 is local to @xmath19 because @xmath220 is , and @xmath126 is low depth ( being the finite time ordered exponent of a bounded local hamiltonian ) .",
    "plugging and into gives u_f,^z_r,^z_s , u_f,^=^z_r,_r_s^-1^z_s,=^z_r,^z_s , implying that [ eq : equality of the thetas ] _",
    "r=_s despite the fact that @xmath226 are exponentially localized to potentially distant sites @xmath148  in particular we could say choose @xmath227 to be of order the system size . the implication is then that , up to exponentially small corrections in system size , @xmath228 are pure phases .",
    "the corrections take the form @xmath229 , where @xmath230 do not depend on the system size , and only depends on the details of @xmath231 ( such as their depth , which is assumed to be finite ) .",
    "the fact @xmath232 and @xmath233 approximately a pure phase implies @xmath234 where @xmath235 is a correction of the form @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",

    "here we argue that diagonalizing unitaries @xmath89 for families of unitaries @xmath52 respecting a fixed symmetry ( e.g. , ising parity or time reversal ) and exhibiting absolutely stable long ranged order , can themselves be chosen to commute with the fixed symmetry . for concreteness ,",

    "assuming the same is true of @xmath52 for now , consider the action of @xmath29 on eigenstates .",
    "as @xmath242 , it follows that @xmath243 . hence @xmath29 preserves eigenstates of @xmath52 .",

    "the upshot is that the unitary _ _ ^-1 _ , commutes with the commuting set of operators @xmath250 . as these operators uniquely label a complete basis , @xmath251 is completely diagonal in @xmath252 . in other words",
