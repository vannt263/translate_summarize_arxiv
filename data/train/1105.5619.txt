    "the requirement for stationary action then reads @xmath47 .    when @xmath48 , the above procedure directly gives newtonian mechanics and has the advantage of being generally valid under coordinate transformations , @xmath49 .",

    "a stochastic generalization may be to permit small deviations by constraining @xmath58 in ( [ eq : p ] ) .",
    "the resulting matrices of constraint values ( lagrange multipliers @xmath59 ) can restrict deviations in the action in a history - dependent and non - local way .",
    "each deviation in the action can be thought of as arising from elastic collisions with un - modeled molecules from the surrounding ` bath ' environment or as an unknown lagrangian applied to the system between times @xmath60 and @xmath27@xcite ( with @xmath61 a small time increment ) . without any other constraints ,",
    "this squared - deviation constraint implies interaction with a completely chaotic ( infinite temperature ) bath and does not conserve energy , momentum , etc . except in the deterministic limit ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "when two systems are coupled , the combined system should obey a set of conservation laws .",
    "as formalized by noether s theorem,@xcite such conservation laws can be derived for a single system directly from the action formulation by considering continuous transformations of the trajectory @xmath63 in a region around @xmath64  where @xmath65 .",
    "because the action is stationary with respect to small perturbations in @xmath66 , there exists a vanishing quantity , @xmath67 ( with @xmath68 reserved for denoting transposition ) and it is possible to define an invariant ( using @xmath69 ) .",
    "@xmath70 feynman showed that if the action functional is invariant to this transformation ( @xmath71 = \\mathcal a[x(t)+q(t , a)]$ ] ) then the corresponding invariant is a conventional conserved quantity  e.g. @xmath72 ( @xmath73 , the ones - vector ) generates the momentum , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) generates the energy , etc .",
    "it is instructive to consider a case where the action is not invariant to the transformation .",
    "for example , the form of the action is changed using the substitution for momentum in the simple harmonic oscillator ( @xmath76 ) . however ,",

    "exchange_. if the net momentum of the observed system changes by more than its internal force , it implies that an external system has lost exactly this amount of momentum . in the presence of noise ,",
    "this quantity may not be conserved ( @xmath79 is stochastic )  so that one effect of the noise is to re - distribute @xmath77 over the system and the bath .    in general , we can define a set of constraints on @xmath80 using an @xmath81 matrix @xmath82 , whose columns correspond to the constraint directions @xmath83 and whose leftmost column is reserved for the energy @xmath84 . in this case , the vector of exchanges for a given trajectory over a given time interval , @xmath61 , is @xmath85 in this equation , the presence of @xmath61 is used to implicitly denote the stratonovich integral ( see appendix ) .",
    "these considerations have shown a simple method for including the influence of an external system on the dynamics .",

    "this can be done by adding a hypothetical constraint , @xmath114 , defined for some set of atoms or region of space in the system .",

    "the memory term derived here is similar to the form postulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which lead to a quantitative treatment of memory effects .",
    "here we can see it to be a natural consequence of placing constraints on the squared deviation of the action and the energy change at each time - step .",
    "having firmly established the connection to the equilibrium distribution above , we can construct a high - level view of any process employing a series of transition probabilities to effect a change in the state of the system .",
    "this construction will lead naturally to a view of the process in terms of a thermodynamic path transforming one type of energy into another with a concomitant irreversible entropy production .    to begin",
    ", we exactly define a system state , @xmath8 , as any information which is known about a system that is sufficient to construct a probability distribution for its variables , @xmath129 .",
    "the machinery of statistical mechanics can then be used to propagate this information to system states at other time - points and under alternate possible processes .",
    "the work of joule and thomson showed that there exists a series of mechanical operations that can be performed to effect a transition between any two thermostatic states,@xcite however this transition can only take place in the direction of increasing entropy .",
    "the entropy increase comes about because of experimental inability to control the detailed motions of all particles , and is therefore zero in the case of completely controllable mechanical work .",
    "thus , it is important to define a mechanical , adiabatic process , in which all work is completely controlled by letting @xmath130 with constant external force experienced by the system @xmath131 .",
    "this is formally a zero - temperature , continuous - time limit , since at at a finite temperature there is some amount of uncertainty about the exact state of @xmath87 on short timescales , which leads to a discrepancy between the force exerted by the external system and its `` long - timescale '' counterpart experienced by the system . in general , only a subset of work values can be controlled , and before proceeding it will be necessary to solidify the concept of controllable work .",
    "if this work is to be delivered by an external thermostatic system , for example an adiabatically coupled piston , then the first law of thermostatics gives @xmath132 if the force can be assumed constant over a sufficiently short time - step .",
    "mechanically , this force corresponds to the force on a wall exerted by a spring placed externally to it .",
    "the total force on the wall is , of course , @xmath133 which implies that if a two spring system were disconnected after a change @xmath134^t$ ] , their internal potential energies would have changed by an amount @xmath135^t \\notag .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sum of these two energy changes is not necessarily zero due to the possibility of momentum change . using the known energy change of the system ,",
    "it should then be possible to solve for the change in kinetic energy of the constraint .",
    "for the system , the _ total _ energy change is given by @xmath136 where we have used eq .",
    "[ eq : da ] for @xmath137 , multiplied by @xmath138 , to define work values and a corresponding `` non - mechanical '' energy transfer , @xmath139 . in the adiabatic limit , all energy transferred to the system by external forces should be reflected by known mechanical changes ( related to @xmath140 )  which is precisely what @xmath141 allows us to do .",

    "substituting this quantity from the langevin equation ( [ eq : langevin ] ) , an adiabatic , mechanical system must satisfy @xmath144 the last section gave some physical insight into the quantities @xmath141 .",
    "a mathematical consideration of the previous equation shows that @xmath145 ( @xmath146 being identical to @xmath82 with the first column removed ) can be understood as a projection , removing components of @xmath118 parallel to @xmath147 . if we therefore define ( writing the moore - penrose pseudoinverse of @xmath8 as @xmath148 ) @xmath149 then @xmath150 identically .",

    ", the work is @xmath156 here `` @xmath157 '' denotes a sum over @xmath158 ( one - dimensional ) atoms , with obvious extension to multiple dimensions . because this interaction controls only the total system momentum , the work is computed using the average velocity change . as shown in the appendix ,",
    "the expectation of this stochastic integral is @xmath159 .",
    "similarly , an electric field can couple only to the net dipole moment of a system .",
    "this implies the transformation of applied energy to heat if it can not be manipulated to perfectly match fluctuations in the driven variable .",
    "the kinetic energy change of @xmath87 , ascribed to the reservoir , can be determined in the mechanical limit from @xmath160 using eqns .",
    "[ eq : due ] and  [ eq : dw ] . ] .",
    "the above equations thus completely describe any exchange of mechanical energy between deterministic systems exerting known forces .",
    "if the two - spring system considered above were disconnected at time @xmath161 , an outside observer absorbing the kinetic energy of the wall ( eq .  [ eq : dk ] ) , the energy change of the reservoir would reduce to the usual thermostatic potential change @xmath162 .",
    "a well known consequence of liouville s theorem is that the entropy change is zero in a completely deterministic process.@xcite using adiabatic processes , then , it is possible to propagate a starting state , @xmath8 , to any state with constant entropy . if , however , phase space volume were not preserved , it would amount to a discarding of information on the state of the system at a given time ( for example , by integrating the probability over short time intervals ) .",
    "then the amount of work that can be recovered from the system will become less than the amount input . in an extreme case ,",
    "all information about the system may have been lost , flushing the corresponding information content to zero . starting from this unknown state , @xmath163 ,",

    "it therefore stands to reason that any adiabatic process should be described by not only the above mechanical work values , but also the change in information entropy due to information loss .",
    "next , consider allowing heat exchange in addition to controllable work .",
    "assuming an infinitely large reservoir ( or a short enough time - step ) , added heat will cause a negligible change in reservoir temperature . because we have assumed the work done on each reservoir ( [ eq : due ] ) can be reversibly stored , these are not associated with an entropy change .",
    "we therefore introduce the physical entropy change in the reservoir as due only to exchange of heat , or `` non - work '' energy , @xmath170 , with @xmath171 , and @xmath172 originating from heat removed from the system plus a kinetic energy , @xmath173 , assumed to be recoverable only as heat . in this work ,",
    "different notations are used for the information entropy , @xmath38 , the physical entropy , @xmath161 , the caliber , @xmath174 , and the caliber - like functional , @xmath175 .",
    "all of these quantities are defined to be unitless and have some relation to the information entropy of eq .",
    "[ eq : s ] .",
    "@xmath176 the energy rejected to the reservoir as heat can alternately be understood as the total energy dumped to the environment minus the energy removed `` reversibly '' ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "this interpretation shows that if some of the changes in the environment were re - classified as irreversibly stored , so that the information @xmath178 becomes lost , then this is equivalent to adding that energy to the total @xmath172 .",

    "<S> these two relations form a rough draft for the a first law of nonequilibrium thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the usual second law prescription of increasing entropy , the above establishes the direction in which the system will relax toward equilibrium and an estimate of the entropy increase by this process . </S>",
    "<S> however , the linear transport equations have been derived by analogy with the equilibrium theory , and their interpretation must be made with respect to the entropy of a quasi - steady process . </S>",
    "<S> a more satisfactory development would therefore determine the range of conditions for which eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : onsager ] holds , as well as provide a foundation for studying processes with arbitrary driving forces and defined without reference to any equilibrium state . if , in addition , the theory was able to resemble the well - known equilibrium statistical mechanics , it would offer a wealth of immediate insight into new applications for which now standard nonequilibrium methods may prove cumbersome and error prone </S>",
    "<S> . such a resemblance must be reached by defining path functionals analogous to the energy and entropy of equilibrium states  and would therefore constitute a true statistical mechanics for thermodynamics ( as opposed to thermostatics ) </S>",
    "<S> . our first question in this investigation will be how such a microscopic first law of thermodynamics can be formulated .    </S>",
    "<S> although much work has been devoted to the above problems , these questions have been addressed from a large number of different viewpoints in the last thirty years . </S>",
    "<S> further , there appears to be little consensus on a unifying , general , set of relations from which which all nonequilibrium results may be derived.@xcite recent work has centered on a second question of deriving a microscopic second law of thermodynamics through proving the existence of fluctuation theorems@xcite and exploring their consequences for nonequilibrium systems .    </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental fluctuation theorem result is an expression for the `` lost work '' over and above the equilibrium free energy for stochastic processes that convert one thermostatic state to another@xcite via mechanical driving . </S>",
    "<S> this lost work can be interpreted as an entropy increase . </S>",
    "<S> it is simple to show in the case of an isolated deterministic system@xcite @xmath3 where the work , @xmath4 , is the gain in system energy @xmath5 , and both distributions are required to be at the same temperature , @xmath6 , to use the equilibrium relation @xmath7.@xcite further work has provided examples of many fluctuation theorems.@xcite each can be used to define a measure of irreversibility , since for any two path probabilities , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 \\ge 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the kullback - leibler divergence ( and necessarily positive ) . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , the extension of this formalism to systems lacking momentum , such as discrete processes described by a transition probability matrix is also unclear ( although suggestions involving a [ possibly non - unique ] stationary distribution ) have been offered@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> until these issues are resolved , there does not exist a definitive path functional able to answer the first question above .    </S>",
    "<S> early works were principally focused on the first question . </S>",
    "<S> after a detailed picture of how time - correlations control the rate of relaxation to equilibrium@xcite , a general set of relations ( projector - operator theory@xcite ) was described from which all such macroscopic relaxations may be derived.the principal content of the theory was to define a coarsening , projection , operator which removes information about the unmodeled degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the exact , non - markovian kinetic equation for the probability distribution in the space of remaining variables then shows the relaxation process in the form of a time convolution of the time - correlation functions and the thermodynamic forces driving them to equilibrium.@xcite that is , eq .

    "<S> has not yet been fully justified in terms of the maximum entropy formalism or clarified to the point where it is possible to derive the above from a second derivative@xcite  analogous to the gibbs relations for equilibrium which give rise to obviously related quantities such as heat capacity , compressibility and coefficient of thermal expansion .    at this point , </S>",
    "<S> the situation shared a peculiar similarity to the circumstances surrounding gibb s classical text introducing the principle of maximum entropy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the method for deriving fluctuation dissipation theorems ( analogous to the first law ) was to define a system evolving according to an exact lagrangian , make a random phase approximation to yield an ensemble of exactly evolving trajectories , and then derive a corresponding `` physical '' distribution on trajectory space ( analogous to phase - space , tbl .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tbl : corresp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> because of the prevailing attitude regarding mechanics as the only possible method for solving such problems at the time , gibbs use of maximum entropy methods was seen as a non - physical trick@xcite to derive properties of molecular equilibrium . again , introducing maximum entropy lead to an expansive generalization of the fluctuation dissipation theorem by jaynes@xcite  who , it should be noted , has recognized and written about the above conflict of gibbs@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> jaynes introduced maximum entropy following the program of gibbs and using the subjective interpretation of probability used by laplace and jeffreys.@xcite making the substitution from a state ( containing a variable at a single time ) to an entire trajectory immediately identifies a non - equilibrium analog of the gibbs ensemble , complete with entropy and free energy functionals on trajectory space . pursuing the analogy further , jaynes showed that the first derivatives of the path free energy yielded averages of path functionals , and the second derivatives ( minus the space and time - correlation functions ) give their `` first - order '' perturbation with respect to changing the thermodynamic forces , @xmath20@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . therefore we can shorten eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : zwanzig ] to @xmath21 for _ any _ path functional , @xmath22 , we wish to average and _ any _ set of `` controlled '' quantities @xmath23 which define our trajectory ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> if , for example , @xmath23 included time and space - dependent particle fluxes ( i.e. @xmath24 indexes both time and space so that @xmath25 ) , then eq .  [ eq : jaynes ] easily generalizes eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : onsager ] to fluctuation relations defined directly from the set of constrained path functionals , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the perturbation expansion above is not defined by reference to an equilibrium state , but instead with respect to a reference probability distribution on path space . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such elegant derivations of fluctuation theorems have been given many times in works employing path integral methods@xcite such as those related to the onsager - machlup action@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further work@xcite has also shown how jaynes path entropy may be connected to fluctuation and entropy production theorems .    </S>",
    "<S> however , eq .  [ eq : jaynes ] contains a fatal flaw . to see this </S>",
    "<S> , first note that the average of a quantity at time @xmath27 is dependent on the `` control '' parameters throughout the whole trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> this is because logical inference does not contain a preferential time direction , and knowledge that the system has a given property at time @xmath28 constrains the state at time @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> although this could be alleviated by requiring only casual information to enter into the determination of the state at time @xmath27 , this approach leads to a probability distribution valid only for @xmath29 and not any previous times . </S>",
    "<S> a better approach is to maximize the entropy of the transition probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> limiting the scope of the maximum trajectory entropy procedure in this way automatically corrects a related re - normalization problem . </S>",
    "<S> suppose phase space were to branch at a future time @xmath28 . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> a uniform measure on path space would assign points at time @xmath27 a different weight depending on future events . </S>",
    "<S> a simple example is the monty hall problem with a prize assigned to the first door without loss of generality.@xcite the contestant s choice of one of three doors plus monty opening another ( not concealing a prize ) constitutes four possible paths , and maximum path entropy would give each path an equal weight  an intuitive , but incorrect , solution . </S>",
    "<S> the correct probability assignment is a uniform distribution for each _ transition _ , leading to ending weights of @xmath30 for the two paths following the selection of the first door , ( contestant s correct choice plus monty choosing randomly from the remaining doors ) , and @xmath31 ( contestant s two incorrect choices plus monty s forced choice of an incorrect door ) . ] . in more abstract terms </S>",
    "<S> , the marginal probability at each time should not depend on the future  a concept expressed mathematically by defining a progressively measurable function with respect to the natural filtration of stochastic processes@xcite .    in practice </S>",
    "<S> , this flaw can be avoided by considering only processes where assigning equal _ a priori _ weight to all paths is equivalent to assigning equal weight to all transitions . by liouville </S>",
    "<S> s theorem , this is obviously true for deterministic processes . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the approaches are equivalent when the number of possible transitions does not depend on the starting point . </S>",
    "<S> the path entropy approach of jaynes is therefore valid in the absence of factors re - normalizing for starting - point dependent differences in the number of possible paths ( @xmath32 = z[\\lambda_i]$ ] in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : z ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a further question remains on the application of fluctuation - dissipation theorems to both langevin and brownian ( overdamped langevin ) processes . </S>",
    "<S> what is the appropriate order for coarse - grained equations of motion ? writing down a langevin equation assumes newtonian , second - order dynamics , whereas the first - order brownian motion can also be derived via the same approach . </S>",
    "<S> although the green - kubo relations were supposed to have solved these problems , ambiguity remains from this approach at a fundamental level because a strict derivation using the method of mechanics does not offer direct insight into the choice of macroscopic variables used for systematic coarse - graining . </S>",
    "<S> in fluid mechanics , either can be applied , and the choice between full newtonian motion models or simplified advection - diffusion models is predictably based on the scales of length , relaxation time , and applied force involved . </S>",
    "<S> several authors have made substantial contributions@xcite in connecting fluid mechanics and non - equilibrium dynamics .    although seemingly incompatible , there are advantages to both the mechanics - based and the statistical derivations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , considering the choice of equations of motion from the statistical perspective of equation  [ eq : jaynes ] at once allows us to see the consequences of each choice . </S>",
    "<S> if we choose a first - order equation of motion , then we substitute the velocity at a point for @xmath22 and expand it about a streaming velocity @xmath33 in the particle fluxes , @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> if second order , then @xmath22 becomes a change in momentum at a point and we expand about the average force , @xmath33 , in the stress tensor of the surrounding fluid , @xmath35.we believe that further corrections sometimes employed in fluid mechanics may also be derived via extending the process that lead to eq .
