    "understanding the properties of kaons and antikaons in the nuclear medium is of especial relevance in the analysis of data from heavy - ion collisions , as well as in the physics of neutron stars interiors . in the latter case , a condensed phase of @xmath1 mesons might appear if they develop enough attraction in the medium , such that it becomes more favorable to neutralize the positive proton charge with antikaons rather than with electrons @xcite .",
    "analysis of kaonic atom data , sensitive to low densities , favor a strongly attractive @xmath1 nucleus interaction  @xcite , although recently weaker potentials have also been shown to describe the data appropriately @xcite .",
    "information on the higher density regime can be inferred from the analysis of heavy - ion collisions data .",
    "for instance , the enhancement of the @xmath1 yield measured recently at gsi @xcite can be explained by a strong attraction in the medium for the k@xmath2 @xcite , although an alternative mechanism , based on the in - medium enhanced @xmath3 reaction , has also been suggested @xcite .",
    "although all experimental indications point at an attractive antikaon potential in the nuclear medium , the size of this attraction has not really been well constrained by the data .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore what the theoretical models predict .",
    "a traditional perspective is that of mean field approaches , built within the modern framework of chiral lagrangians @xcite or based on the relativistic walecka model @xcite .",
    "however , an especially useful point of view is that provided by microscopic models @xcite , since they establish a bridge between the properties of the @xmath0 interaction in the medium and those in free space . this is the approach followed in the present contribution , where we will focus on the results obtained with two different @xmath4 interactions : one is taken from the modern chiral meson - baryon lagrangian in @xmath5-wave @xcite , and the other is the meson - exchange model of the jlich group @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 scattering is dominated by the presence of an isospin zero @xmath5-wave resonance , the @xmath6 . in potential models the @xmath0 scattering observables ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 )",
    "are derived from the scattering amplitude , obtained from the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath9 where the diagonal loop operator @xmath10 stands for the intermediate meson - baryon ( @xmath11 ) propagator and @xmath12 is a suitable @xmath13 transition potential .",
    "a connection with the chiral lagrangian was established in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the properties of the strangeness @xmath14 meson - baryon sector were studied in a potential model that , in born approximation , had the same @xmath5-wave scattering length as the chiral lagrangian , including both the lowest order and the momentum dependent @xmath15 terms .",
    "fitting five parameters , the scattering observables were reproduced and the @xmath16 resonance was generated dynamically from a coupled - channels lippmann - schwinger equation which included the meson - baryon states opened at the @xmath0 threshold . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the data could be reproduced using only the lowest order lagrangian and one parameter , the cut - off used to regularize the loop @xmath10 .",
    "the value of the cut - off , @xmath17 mev , was chosen to reproduce the @xmath18 scattering branching ratios at threshold .",
    "the essential difference with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite was the inclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite of all ten meson - baryon states ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) that can be generated from the octet of pseudoscalar mesons and the octet of ground - state baryons , the @xmath24 state being the most relevant of the new included ones .",
    "the success of this method is analogous to that obtained in the meson - meson sector @xcite , an explanation of which is found by applying the inverse amplitude method in coupled channels taking the lowest and next - to - lowest order meson - meson lagrangians @xcite .",
    "a more recent work corroborates the success of the lowest order meson - baryon lagrangian in reproducing the @xmath0 scattering observables from the point of subtracted dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "we will also explore the antikaon properties as obtained from the @xmath0 jlich interaction @xcite , which is based on a meson - exchange picture .",
    "most of the parameters were taken from their @xmath28 potential in the strangeness @xmath29 sector and the few free ones left were adjusted to reproduce the @xmath18 elastic and inelastic cross section data at low energies .",
    "the advantage of this interaction is that it contains all partial waves and allows for an investigation of their effect on the antikaon potential at the high momenta explored by heavy - ion collisions .",
    "although both @xmath0 interactions describe reasonably well the low energy @xmath18 elastic and inelastic cross sections , some of the scattering observables at threshold , summarized in table [ table:1 ] , are not well reproduced .",
    "clearly , some improvements can still be made for the jlich @xmath0 interaction since the branching ratios were not used for adjusting the parameters of the model .",
    ".@xmath0 scattering observables at threshold [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we first observe that the results from the lowest orders differ appreciably from those obtained by summing the full fadeev series in the fca given by eqs .",
    "( [ sk17 ] ) , ( [ sk19 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the @xmath1 deuteron scattering length obtained from scattering amplitudes that rely on isospin symmetry differ appreciably from that obtained within the physical basis .",
    "finally , the result @xmath30 fm differs from previous multichannel fadeev approaches , @xmath31 fm @xcite and @xmath32 fm @xcite , especially for the imaginary part . as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is mainly due to the different elementary amplitudes used in the different works .",
    "in fact , taking the amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite and using isospin symmetry , which leads to a particularly small imaginary part for the charge exchange @xmath33 amplitude , one obtains the fca result @xmath34 fm , very close to that quoted in ref .",
    "the studies in ref .",
    "@xcite , together with the analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , show that one can associate the remaining differences to the fca which overestimates the full fadeev calculation by about 15% .",
    "although the results described here show that it is not simple to extract the elementary scattering amplitudes from the deuteron data , it can nevertheless be expected that the experimental results from the dear experiment at frascati will introduce a further check of consistency between elementary amplitudes and should bring some light into issues like chiral symmetry and partial isospin breakup .",
    "one source of medium modification of the @xmath0 amplitude is that induced by pauli - blocking @xcite which effectively shifts the intermediate @xmath0 states , and in turn the @xmath6 resonance , to higher energies . due to the strong energy dependence , this shift changes the @xmath0 amplitude around threshold from being repulsive in free space to being attractive in the medium .",
    "the @xmath35 meson thus develops an attractive potential which , when incorporated in the equation determining the in - medium @xmath0 amplitude , compensates the repulsive effect of pauli blocking . when these effects are considered self - consistently , it is observed that the position of the @xmath6 remains unchanged @xcite . since the @xmath36 states have a strong influence in the dynamics of @xmath0 scattering , the dressing of pions was also considered in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , together with mean - field potentials for the baryons participating in the coupled - channels problem .",
    "these medium effects are incorporated by replacing the free baryon and meson propagators by dressed ones in the meson - baryon loop - function which then reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total four - momentum in the lab frame , @xmath39 is the nucleon occupation probability , and @xmath40 is the @xmath35 spectral density , which in free space reduces to @xmath41 .",
    "the in - medium antikaon propagator , @xmath42 , is determined from the antikaon self - energy , @xmath43 , which is obtained by summing the in - medium @xmath44 interaction , @xmath45 , over the nucleons in the fermi sea @xmath46 note that a self - consistent approach is required since one calculates the @xmath35 self - energy from the effective interaction @xmath47 which uses @xmath35 propagators which themselves include the self - energy being calculated .",
    "@xmath0 scattering amplitude as functions of @xmath48 for @xmath49 and several densities ( from @xcite and @xcite ) . ]",
    "the free @xmath0 amplitude in the @xmath50 , @xmath51 channel is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ampl ] , where it is compared with the in - medium one at two nuclear densities , @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "@xcite , based on the chiral lagrangian model @xcite , and that of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the meson - exchange @xmath0 interaction @xcite .",
    "we observe that the medium modified amplitudes show the same qualitative trends .",
    "note also how the real part of the amplitude ( upper panels ) at the @xmath18 threshold ( @xmath55 mev ) is repulsive in free space and attractive in the medium . the thick solid line on the left panels show the additional effect on the @xmath0 amplitude of dressing the pions in the intermediate states @xcite .",
    "most of the available models study the in - medium @xmath0 amplitude in @xmath5-wave .",
    "however , if one aims at extracting the properties of antikaons through the analysis of heavy - ion collisions , one must keep in mind that they are created at a finite momentum of around @xmath56 mev / c , hence the effect of higher partial waves might be relevant .",
    "the meson - exchange @xmath0 potential of the jlich group @xcite is given in partial waves and allows a straightforward analysis of the importance of the @xmath57 components . from the chiral perspective",
    ", the @xmath58-wave amplitudes up to the next - to - leading order @xmath0 chiral lagrangian have been identified and the parameters have been fitted to reproduce a large amount of low energy data @xcite . however , a nuclear medium application of this model is not available yet .",

    "the left one corresponds to the @xmath1 pole branch , appearing at an energy smaller than the kaon mass , @xmath62 , due to the attractive @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "the peak on the right corresponds to the @xmath6-hole excitation mode , which appears around @xmath62 . as density increases",
    ", the @xmath1 feels an enhanced attraction while the @xmath6-hole peak loses strength and dissolves in the dense nuclear medium .",
    "when the dressing of the pion is also incorporated , the effective interaction @xmath47 becomes even smoother and the resulting @xmath1 spectral function is displayed in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : kspec ] .",
    "even at very small densities one can no longer distinguish the @xmath6-hole peak from the @xmath1 pole one .",
    "as density increases , the attraction felt by the @xmath1 is more moderate and the @xmath1 pole peak appears at higher energies than before .",
    "however , more strength is found at very low energies , especially at @xmath59 , due to the particle - hole ( @xmath63 ) components of the pionic strength , which couple the @xmath0 pair to @xmath64 states .",
    "it is precisely the opening of the @xmath65 channel , on top of the already opened @xmath64 one , which causes a cusp around 400 mev .",
    "the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite using the jlich @xmath0 interaction , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kspec2 ] , obtains qualitatively similar results as those in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : kspec ] , where only antikaons are dressed .",
    "we notice an additional structure in the spectral function to the left of the quasiparticle peak at energies of the @xmath35 around @xmath66 mev , which is not present when only the @xmath51 component of the @xmath0 interaction is retained ( dotted line ) .",
    "this peak is indicating the physical in - medium excitation of @xmath67 states with antikaon quantum numbers coming from the @xmath68 , @xmath69 component of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "a non - relativistic antikaon potential can be obtained from the self - energy at the quasiparticle energy via the relation @xmath70     obtained in ref .",

    "@xcite at @xmath71 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : upot1 ] for two approximations , one in which only the antikaons are dressed self - consistently ( thin solid lines ) and another in which the self - energy of the pions is also included ( thick solide line ) . note that the antikaon potential obtained when the pions are also dressed has much less structure .",
    "this is due in part to the smoother in - medium amplitude , but also to the different quasiparticle energy at which the antikaon self - energy is evaluated .",
    "this quasiparticle energy is more attractive when only antikaons are dressed and , hence , the amplitude is explored at lower energy regions , closer to the position of the in - medium @xmath6 resonance .",
    "results from the model of ref .",
    "@xcite using the jlich @xmath72 potential are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : upot2 ] , where the effect of including the higher partial waves can be seen . already at zero momentum",
    ", fermi motion induces some small contribution of partial waves higher than @xmath51 .",
    "clearly , the effect of the higher partial waves increases with increasing @xmath35 momentum , flattening out the real part of the potential and producing more structure to the imaginary part . at an antikaon momentum of around 500 mev / c , the inclusion of the higher partial waves practically doubles the size of the antikaon potential with respect to the @xmath5-wave value .",
    "since in kaonic atoms the @xmath1 is bound with a small ( atomic ) energy , their study requires the knowledge of the antikaon self - energy at @xmath73 . the density - dependent self - energy obtained with",
    "the chiral model has been recently used to study kaonic atoms in the framework of a local density approximation @xcite , which amounts to replace the nuclear matter density @xmath74 by the density profile @xmath75 of the particular nucleus .",
    "the results , displayed in fig .  [ fig : katom ] , show that both the energy shifts and widths of kaonic atom states agree well with the bulk of experimental data @xcite .",
    "recent investigations that respect the low density theorem @xcite show that the non - local corrections , coming from the energy and momentum dependence of the potential , from the @xmath58-wave terms of the meson - baryon lagrangian and from fermi motion , are small and lead to changes in the widths and shifts smaller than the experimental errors .",
    "reproducing kaonic atom data with the moderately attractive antikaon nucleus potential of @xmath76 mev obtained from the chiral model @xcite is in contrast with the depth of around @xmath77 mev obtained from a best fit to @xmath1 atomic data with a phenomenological potential that includes an additional non - linear density dependent term @xcite",
    ". a clarifying quantitative comparison of kaonic atom results obtained with various @xmath1-nucleus potentials can be found in ref .",
    "it is shown there that adding to the chiral potential a phenomenological piece , which is fitted to the data , the @xmath78 is reduced from 3.8 to 1.6 .",
    "the resulting potential is slightly more attractive ( @xmath79 mev at @xmath59 ) and the imaginary part is reduced by about a factor 2 .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite reemphasizes that kaonic atoms only explore the antikaon potential at the surface of the nucleus .",
    "therefore , although all models predict attraction for the @xmath1-nucleus potential , the precise value of its depth at the center of the nucleus , which has important implications for the occurrence of kaon condensation , is still not known .",
    "it is then necessary to gather more data that could help in disentangling the properties of the @xmath80 meson in the medium .",
    "apart from the valuable information that can be extracted from the production of @xmath1 in heavy - ion collisions , one could also study deeply bound kaonic states , which have been predicted to be narrow @xcite and could be measured in @xmath81 @xcite or @xmath82 reactions @xcite .",
