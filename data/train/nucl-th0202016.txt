    "the nuclear structure function @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath1 times the free nucleon structure function @xmath2 for values of @xmath3 in the regime where valence quarks are dominant .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the european muon collaboration ( emc ) effect @xcite , has been known for almost twenty years .",
    "nevertheless , the significance of this observation remains unresolved even though there is a clear interpretation within the parton model : a valence quark in a bound nucleon carries less momentum than a valence quark in a free one .",
    "there are many possible explanations , but no universally accepted one . the underlying mechanism responsible for the transfer of momentum within the constituents of the nucleus",
    "has not yet been specified .",
    "one popular mechanism involves ordinary nuclear binding which , in its simplest inculcation , is represented by evaluating the free nucleon structure function at a value of @xmath3 increased by a factor of the average separation energy divided by the nucleon mass @xmath4 .",
    "the validity of this binding effect has been questioned ; see the reviews @xcite .",
    "the bjorken variable @xmath3 is a fraction of the plus component of momentum , and the desire to obtain a more precise evaluation and understanding of the binding effect lead us to attempt to obtain a nuclear wave function in which the momentum of the nucleons is expressed in terms of this same plus component .",
    "therefore we applied light front dynamics to determining nuclear wave functions @xcite . in this formalism",
    "one defines @xmath5 and quantizes on equal @xmath6 surfaces which have a constant light front time , @xmath7 .",
    "the conjugate operator @xmath8 acts as an evolution operator for @xmath7 .",
    "the plus momentum is canonically conjugate to the spatial @xmath9 variable .",
    "this light front formalism has a variety of advantages @xcite and also entails complications @xcite .",
    "our most recent result @xcite is that the use of the relativistic mean field approximation , and the assumption that the structure of the nucleon is not modified by effects of the medium , to describe infinite nuclear matter leads to no appreciable binding effect .",
    "the failure was encapsulated in terms of the hugenholtz - van hove theorem @xcite which states that the average nuclear binding energy per nucleon is equal to the binding energy of a nucleon at the top of the fermi sea .",
    "the light front version of this theorem is obtained from the requirement that , in the nuclear rest frame , the expectation values of the total plus and minus momentum are equal .",
    "the original version of the theorem was obtained in a non - relativistic theory in which nucleons are the only degrees of freedom . here , the mesons are important and the theory is relativistic , but the theorem still holds . this theorem can be shown to restrict @xcite the plus momentum carried by nucleons to be the mass of the nucleus , which in turn implies that the probability for a nucleon to have a plus momentum @xmath10 is narrowly peaked about @xmath11 .",
    "thus the only binding effect arises from the average binding energy , which is much smaller than the average separation energy .",
    "therefore dynamics beyond the relativistic mean field approximation must be invoked to explain the emc effect .",
    "this conclusion was limited to the case of infinite nuclear matter , and the computed nuclear structure function could only be compared with data on finite nuclear targets extrapolated to the limit @xmath12 . the goal of the present work is to extend the results to finite nuclei ; the main complication arises from the spatial dependence of the nucleon and meson fields .",
    "we briefly outline our procedure . in sections",
    "[ sec : green ] and [ sec : subtle ] we present the covariant deep inelastic scattering formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite and derive its representation in terms of nucleon single particle wave functions .",
    "the plus momentum distribution follows from this representation in section [ sec : derivation ] where we also derive new version of the hugenholtz - van hove theorem .",
    "then we present the results of analytic and numerical calculations in section [ sec : numbers ] , the latter giving an @xmath1 dependence of the ratio function contrary to experimental results .",
    "this again gives the result that the use of the relativistic mean field approximation , combined with the assumption that the nuclear medium does not modify the structure of the nucleon , can not describe the emc effect .",
    "the reasons for the subtle differences between the results for finite nuclei and nuclear matter are detailed in section [ sec : scalar ] .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss possible implications .",
    "we begin with the covariant plus momentum distribution function @xmath13 \\label{eq : fn}\\ ] ] where we identify @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the connected part of the nucleon green s function : @xmath16 this result is directly determined from the feynman diagram in fig .",

    "@xcite , where the nucleon fields , @xmath20 , that appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) are those appearing in the lagrangian .",

    "we show the combined effect of scalar mesons and binding energy per nucleon on the ratio function along with the effect of scalar mesons alone using a constant binding energy per nucleon of @xmath120 independent of @xmath1 .",
    "it can be seen that a changing @xmath115 with @xmath1 has the most effect for nuclei much larger than iron , but does not change the general trend that the minimum of the ratio function becomes less pronounced as @xmath1 increases due to the vanishing scalar meson contribution and the peak of the plus momentum distribution approaching unity .",
    "this dependence of the binding effect on @xmath1 is quite different , both in magnitude and shape , than the trend in experimental data summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite which satisfies @xmath123 , so that the minimum becomes more pronounced as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this fully demonstrates the inadequacy of conventional nucleon - meson dynamics to explain the emc effect .",
    "the average value of @xmath73 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hvh ] ) , yields the nucleon contribution to the plus momentum , and is less than one which can be seen in fig .  [ fig : fn ] .",
    "we now address the remaining plus momentum in finite nuclei .",
    "previous results @xcite show that a small fraction ( @xmath124 ) of the plus momentum is carried by the scalar mesons which vanishes as the nuclear matter limit is approached .",
    "this is due to the fact that scalar mesons couple to gradients in the scalar density ( arising mainly from the surface of finite nuclei ) which vanish as @xmath114 .",
    "the question is : why are scalar mesons allowed to carry plus momentum and not vector mesons ?",
    "the simplest answer lies in the dirac structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fn ] ) ; the @xmath53 in the trace picks out terms in the full interacting green s function with an odd number of gamma matrices which includes all lorentz vector interactions and excludes lorentz scalar interactions .",
    "the dirac structure of @xmath68 is directly related to the dirac structure of the energy momentum tensor , so the answer also lies there and illuminates a problem with conventional nucleon - meson dynamics .",
    "the component of the energy momentum tensor relevant to the plus momentum , from a chiral lagrangian containing isoscalar vector mesons , scalar mesons and pions , is given by @xcite @xmath125 since each of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t++ ] ) involves one of the fields , it is natural to associate each term with a particular contribution to the plus momentum .",
    "this decomposition , though , is not well defined ; field equations relate various components .",
    "we see the first three terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : t++ ] ) appear in @xmath126 , which defines the nucleon contribution to the total nuclear plus momentum , in the derivation of the hugenholtz - van hove theorem eq .",
    "( [ eq : hvh ] ) ; we are not allowed to have the vector mesons contribute a well defined fraction of plus momentum .",
    "this means that one could trade certain mesonic degrees of freedom for nucleons by replacing mesonic vertices with nucleon point couplings , for example , in line with the general concept of effective field theory . in our case",
    "the first three terms are related by the vector meson field equation , but the fourth is left out since the scalar mesons couple to the scalar density @xmath127 which is not present in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t++ ] ) . therefore the scalar mesons ( and pions )",
    "contribute a well defined fraction of plus momentum .",
    "these explicit meson contributions create an emc binding effect , but the pionic contributions are also limited by nuclear drell - yan experiments @xcite to carrying about 2% of the plus momentum which is insufficient to account for the entire emc effect which corresponds to about 5% of the plus momentum for iron .",
    "the minimum in the emc effect is known to have a monotonically decreasing behavior with @xmath1 , which has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite among others .",
    "our present theory is defined by the use of the mean - field approximation , along with the assumption that nuclear effects do not modify the structure of the nucleon .",
    "this theory leads to results in severe disagreement with experiment . not only",
    "do we find that the depth of the minimum is monotonically decreasing with @xmath1 , but it has a smaller magnitude than experiment .",
    "these results , which fail to capture any of the important features of the experiments , represent a failure of relativistic mean field theory .",
    "furthermore , the plus momentum distributions we compute give @xmath128 which indicates that nearly all of the plus momentum is carried by the nucleons . in order to reproduce the data ,",
    "the nucleon plus momentum must be decreased by some mechanism that becomes more important at larger @xmath1 .",
    "nucleon - nucleon correlations can not take plus momentum from nucleons , and explicit mesonic components in the nuclear fock state wavefunction carrying plus momentum are limited @xcite by drell - yan experiments @xcite .",
    "thus it appears that the emc effect may be due to something outside of conventional nucleon - meson dynamics .",
    "for example , true modifications to nucleon structure caused by nuclear interactions could be important , in which case one would need to use models such as the mini - delocalization model @xcite , quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite or the chiral quark soliton model reviewed in @xcite to include those effects .",
