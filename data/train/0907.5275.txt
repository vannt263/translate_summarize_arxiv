    "the observation of uhecp and the interpretation of the related phenomenology is one of the most challenging topics of modern high - energy astro - particle physics .",
    "direct detection is impossible at these energies , due to the exceedingly low flux , but uhecp can be detected by observing the extensive air showers ( eas ) produced by the interaction of the primary particle with the earth atmosphere ( see  @xcite , and references therein , for recent reviews on these topics ) .",
    "the ground - based pierre auger observatory ( pao )  @xcite is currently taking data : its south site ( surface of 3000 km@xmath6 ) in argentina and its forthcoming north site in the us ( 20000 km@xmath6 ) will provide , in the next few years , a clear understanding of many important topics  @xcite .",
    "however , a next generation of experiments with sensitivity to uhecp flux well above the pao one at the highest energies is essential but it seems to be difficult to realize by extending the ground - based technique at ever larger arrays .",

    "however , fluorescence light detection is limited to moonless nights and is affected by weather conditions .    in 1979",
    "j. linsley  @xcite proposed for the first time the idea of detecting eas fluorescence light with a telescope in orbit around the earth . while this approach is technically , programmatically and economically challenging , it is one of the most promising that might allow a big step forward in this field , opening a new window on the universe . a space based experiment might observe eas on an effective surface of a few times 10@xmath7 km@xmath6 , increasing the event statistics by more than an order of magnitude compared to existing and running ground based experiments , even when taking into account that the duty cycle for observing eas with fluorescence is limited to clear and moonless nights . moreover , the huge target mass of the observed air volume three orders of magnitude more than the current or foreseen projects in the south pole ice @xcite or mediterranean sea @xcite ) may open the era of high energy neutrino astronomy , at least above energies of the order of 10@xmath8 ev or so .",
    "however , we do not discuss high energy neutrino detection in this paper .",
    "the relevance of this innovative approach is widely recognized by the scientific community .",

    "nevertheless it did not continue only for programmatic reasons related to international space station and space shuttle availability . the inclusion of uhecp physics in the esa cosmic vision 2015 - 2025 program  @xcite provides a suitable framework for the study of future space missions .",
    "an introduction to the basic issues concerning the detection of uhecp with a space detector can be found in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we therefore report the results obtained in the context of the euso collaboration by means of a full simulation and reconstruction software code named esaf , standing for _ euso simulation and analysis framework_.    particularly , we report about results concerning energy threshold as function of uhecp direction and detector size and geometry , direction and energy resolution , the dependence on atmospheric conditions and clouds .    this paper is structured as follows : section  [ sec : esaf ] presents the esaf design ; section  [ sec : simu ] describes the simulation part , giving details on each modules , from the eas development to the detector response ; section  [ sec : reco ] contains a description of the reconstruction tasks ; section [ sec : results ] presents several results obtained with the esaf code ; the most relevant features are summarized in the conclusions .",
    "esaf handles the whole simulation and reconstruction chain from primary particle interaction in the earth atmosphere until the final reconstruction of the event .",
    "the code includes :    * extensive air shower simulation both by means of internally developed algorithms ( e.g. greizen - ilina - linsley ( gil ) parametrization ,  @xcite ) and with interfaces to existing widely used codes ( e.g. corsika ,  @xcite ) ; * a complete description of the atmosphere , including aerosols and clouds * fluorescence and cherenkov light production * a complete simulation of photon propagation , from production point up to the telescope , including detailed interactions with ground and atmosphere , and a monte - carlo code dealing with multiple scattering * telescope optics simulation * telescope geometry * telescope photodetector simulation * electronics and trigger simulation * background simulation * pattern recognition and shower signal identification above background * reconstruction of direction , energy , and the so called slant depth of the shower maximum ( ) , i.e. the distance ( expressed in  of traversed material ) of the shower maximum from the top of the atmosphere .",

    "a set of dedicated configuration files allow to choose one particular atmosphere model and status among all the possibilities available in esaf , before runs .",
    "the atmospheric parameters are then used at each step where they are required during the simulation or the reconstruction process .",
    "an accurate and physically reliable simulation of eas is fundamental for the correct understanding of the uhecp phenomenology and the possible experimental outcomes . during the last 20 years",
    "several authors have dealt with the very demanding task of preparing detailed uhecp simulation programs . particularly , corsika  @xcite and aires  @xcite , are at present widely used and represent the state of the art in atmospheric shower simulation .",
    "another shower simulator , unisim  @xcite , was developed by some esaf developers , and has the unique feature of simulating neutrino interactions in atmosphere .",
    "the basic esaf approach , therefore , does not uniquely consist in the development of brand new shower simulators , but also in having the capability to handle external shower simulation programs .",
    "this attitude is realized by implementing in esaf a generic interface by means of a shower track object which contains the structure for an extremely detailed description of a single shower event , a description that is even more accurate than any of the output of the present existing simulation programs .",
    "using some specific modules , the user can easily write an interface which plugs into the shower track the shower details event by event .    the shower track can manage all typical variables ( number of charged particles , number of electrons , energy loss .. ) representing the shower during its longitudinal development .",
    "the shower track has a block of general information and a list of shower step objects along the eas longitudinal development .",
    "each shower step object contains an information about the shower longitudinal development corresponding to the track length @xmath10 , which may also vary from event to event . for each step there",
    "is also the possibility to handle histograms representing the local distributions of particles in the shower according to their energy , distance from the axis , direction in space , arrival time , and taking care of preserving some of the most important correlation between couples of such physical quantities .    at present it exists inside esaf an interface to unisim , a preliminary version of interface to corsika , and an interface to conex  @xcite .",
    "in addition to external program interfaces , esaf can also fill event by event the longitudinal description inside the shower object using several parametrizations ( greizen  @xcite , greizen - ilina - linsley ( gil )  @xcite , gaisser - hillas  @xcite ) tuned on data and monte - carlo outcomes .",

    "<S> future detection of extensive air showers ( eas ) produced by ultra high energy cosmic particles by means of space based fluorescence telescopes will open a new window on the universe and allow cosmic ray and neutrino astronomy at a level that is virtually impossible for ground based detectors . in the context of the extreme universe space observatory ( euso ) project , an end - to - end simulation of eas observation with a spatial detector has been designed ( euso simulation and analysis framework , esaf ) . </S>",
    "<S> this paper describes the detailed monte - carlo developed to simulate all the physical processes involved in the fluorescence detection technique , from the eas development to the instrument response . </S>",
    "<S> particular emphasis is given to modeling the light propagation in the atmosphere and the effect of clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation is used to assess the performances of eas spatial detection . </S>",
    "<S> main results on energy threshold and resolution , direction resolution and determination are reported . </S>",
    "<S> results are based on euso telescope design , but are also extended to larger and more sensitive detectors .    </S>",
