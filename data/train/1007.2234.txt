    "recently , it has been reported that energy can be transported by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) while retaining local energy conservation and without breaking causality ( for spin systems  @xcite , for trapped ion systems  @xcite , and for quantum field systems  @xcite ) .",
    "such protocols are called quantum energy teleportation ( qet ) and are based on ground - state entanglement of many - body quantum systems . by performing a local measurement on a subsystem @xmath0 of a many - body system in the ground state , information about the quantum fluctuation of @xmath0 can be extracted . during this measurement , some amount of energy is infused into @xmath0 as qet energy input , and the ground state entanglement gets partially broken .",
    "the measurement result is announced to another subsystem @xmath1 of the many - body system by the classical protocol . using this information ,",
    "energy can be extracted from @xmath1 by performing a local operation on @xmath1 dependent on the announced measurement data .",
    "the root of the protocols is a correlation between the measurement information of @xmath0 and the quantum fluctuation of @xmath1 via the ground state entanglement .",
    "the information about @xmath0 enables us to partially know what kind of zero - point fluctuation of @xmath1 is realized .",
    "thus , using this information , we can select a good operation on @xmath1 for the energy extraction .    in general , we are able to make a better strategy for a task by obtaining more information .",
    "hence , for the qet case , it sounds plausible to imagine that more information about the quantum fluctuation of @xmath1 is obtained by measurements of @xmath0 , more energy can be teleported from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "if we consume a large amount of ground - state entanglement between fluctuation of @xmath0 and fluctuation of @xmath1 during the measurement of @xmath0 , it is naturally expected that much information about the post - measurement state of @xmath1 is included in @xmath0 s measurement result .",
    "therefore , there should exist some qualitative relationship between the breaking of entanglement by measurement and the amount of teleported energy of the optimal operation of @xmath1 .",
    "while the basic protocol of qet has been investigated for several model systems , the analysis of qet for many - body systems has not been development yet .",
    "this is because these quantities are difficult to obtain analytically for many - body systems .",
    "so far , the relation between teleported energy and entanglement breaking has been investigated only for the minimal model of qet  @xcite which consists of two qubits . in this paper",
    ", we aim to establish this relation of qet using a one - dimensional harmonic chain .",
    "there are many works investigating the feature of entanglement in harmonic chain models  @xcite .",
    "the conventional method to analyze the entanglement in a harmonic chain is to introduce two spatial regions containing sites of the harmonic chain and consider the bipartite entanglement between these regions .",
    "previous analysis shows that the zero temperature ground state ( vacuum state ) of the harmonic chain is entangled .",
    "thus this entanglement can become a resource for qet .",
    "as we are not interested in the dynamical aspect of qet in the present analysis , we assumed that the speed of classical communication is infinity and our protocol can be treated as the non - relativistic one .    for a harmonic chain ,",
    "we first consider the setting that groups @xmath0 and the @xmath1 consist of a single site .",
    "we investigate the relation between the amount of teleported energy and the quantum mutual information by changing the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "then we consider the setting with a block of coupled harmonic oscillators as @xmath0 and its complementary set as @xmath1 . increasing the number of measured oscillators in @xmath0",
    ", we calculate both the entanglement breaking between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the amount of energy teleported from @xmath0 to @xmath1 via a qet protocol . as a measure of entanglement",
    ", we use the logarithmic negativity  @xcite .",
    "an explicit inequality is given such that the breaking of entanglement is lower bounded by a positive value that is proportional to the amount of teleported energy .",
    "this shows how much entanglement is required to teleport energy in the harmonic chain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the harmonic chain model and we prepare a formula for the positive oeprator - valued measure ( povm ) measurement for the harmonic chain in sec .",
    "we present our numerical result in sec .",

    "v is devoted to a summary .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional harmonic chain with @xmath2 sites .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 is an even number .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath3 where we assume a periodic boundary condition for @xmath4 and a positive parameter @xmath5 is introduced to regularize the infrared divergence which appears in the correlation matrix .",
    "@xmath6 corresponds to the critical case ( massless limit ) of the harmonic chain .",
    "this criticality allows us to teleport energy to a distant point , decreasing the amount of energy obeying a power law decay with respect to the distance .",
    "as we will show , qet is possible for the non - critical case .",
    "however , the amount of teleported energy decreases exponentially with increasing distance and qet is not so effective .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate qet with near - critical harmonic chains .",

    "\\(1 ) we prepare the ground state of the harmonic chain and define groups @xmath0 and @xmath1 of coupled oscillators in the system . @xmath0 and @xmath1 consist of some number of sites .",
    "the groups @xmath0 and @xmath1 are entangled due to the entanglement of the ground state quantum fluctuation of the harmonic chain .",
    "this entanglement enables us to extract a positive energy via a protocol of qet .",
    "\\(2 ) alice makes a local measurement of quantum fluctuations of sites in the group @xmath0 .",
    "because the post - measurement state is not the ground state , it is an excited state with positive energy .",
    "as some amount of energy is infused through this measurement procedure , the energy of the group @xmath0 after the measurement becomes positive provided that the ground state energy before the measurement is chosen to be zero . by this measurement",
