    "in this note we describe the reweighting of leading order ( lo ) qcd monte carlo ( mc ) programs for @xmath0 production using analytical next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations   of the leading qcd corrections .",
    "since collinear divergences appear even at lo due to photon splitting into collinear @xmath4 pairs , the reweighting has to be performed differently for large and small values of @xmath0-transverse momenta @xmath5 .",
    "first , a short overview over the theoretical status is given in section 2 .",
    "the reweighting method is explained in section 3 with particular emphasis on the lo mc program epvec  @xcite . in the appendices tables for the reweighting",
    "are presented .",
    "in @xcite the differential cross section for ( ) has been calculated with respect to the transverse momentum @xmath5 and rapidity @xmath6 of the @xmath0 boson ; resolved photoproduction is calculated in lo , direct photoproduction in nlo qcd and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) in lo .",
    "typical lo diagrams for the three production mechanisms are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : w1jet_lographs ] . typical nlo diagrams in direct photoproduction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dir_nlographs ] .    for @xmath7  gev direct photoproduction is the dominating process .",
    "nlo qcd corrections modify the lo direct cross section by about @xmath8 at the nominal renormalization / factorization scale @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the @xmath0 mass @xcite .",
    "the remaining theoretical uncertainty is estimated to be about 10% ( instead of about 30% in lo ) .",
    "since the nlo corrections are moderate and only hardly affect the shapes of the differential distributions  @xcite , they can be implemented with sufficient accuracy in a lo monte carlo ( mc ) program by reweighting the generated events .",
    "the hadronic parts of the processes are treated inclusively so that no double counting arises with parton shower effects .",
    "the procedure will be described in section  [ sec : method ] .      in @xcite",
    "the total cross section for resolved photoproduction of @xmath0 bosons at hera is calculated in nlo for total @xmath0 production ( cf .",
    "[ fig : wtot_lographs ] ) while it is of first order in @xmath11 for production ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : w1jet_lographs ] ) . ] .",
    "the total cross sections for direct photoproduction and dis are calculated in lo .",
    "typical lo diagrams for these three types of @xmath0 boson production mechanisms are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wtot_lographs ] . typical nlo diagrams in resolved photoproduction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res_nlographs ] .",
    "the total cross section is dominated by low @xmath5 contributions coming from resolved photoproduction . for this process",
    ", the nlo qcd corrections modify the lo contribution by about 40% at the nominal renormalization / factorization scale @xmath9 , thus affecting the total @xmath0 production rate significantly .",
    "the inclusion of nlo qcd contribution is estimated to reduce the theoretical uncertainty to roughly @xmath12% compared to about @xmath13% at lo .",
    "in the dis and photoproduction regimes are separated by a conventional cut in the photon virtuality @xmath14 .",
    "the photoproduction regime is defined as @xmath15 ( @xmath16 chosen as 4  @xmath17 ) .",
    "if a lo mc uses the same separation cut , the reweighting can be performed separately for the photoproduction regime ( dis stays unreweighted in that case ) , which is described in the following .",
    "this is , however , not the case for the epvec mc which will be discussed separately .      for finite transverse momenta of the @xmath0 boson the event sample for generated partons in the lo mc",
    "is divided in bins of the @xmath0 s transverse momentum @xmath5 and rapidity @xmath6 ( defined to be positive in the electron / positron direction ) . to implement nlo corrections each generated photoproduction event of the corresponding bin",
    "acquires a new weight @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the double differential cross sections for resolved photoproduction in lo and direct photoproduction in nlo as calculated in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the double differential cross sections for resolved and direct photoproduction in lo taken from the mc ) involves the lo cross sections of the mc and _ not _ of the analytical calculation  @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that the major part of differences between the analytical calculation in lo and the mc which could emerge due to different conventions is corrected for . ] .    in the appendix tables for the double differential cross sections",
    "are given for several values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 as calculated in  @xcite .",
    "these values should be taken as mean values for the respective bins .",
    "the bin widths are @xmath23  gev and @xmath24 .",
    "the range of @xmath25  gev and @xmath26 in the center of mass system is covered .",
    "bin fluctuations are estimated be less than 2% and thus negligible .      towards small transverse momenta @xmath5",
    "the differential cross sections diverge due to collinear and infrared divergences .",
    "thus , only the renormalized _ total _ cross sections are calculated analytically  @xcite . in the nlo calculation",
    "the rapidity - integrated cross section for @xmath27  gev can be obtained as @xmath28 for resolved photoproduction and @xmath29 are of the same order of @xmath11 ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : w1jet_lographs ] ,  [ fig : res_nlographs ] ) . ] and by @xmath30 for direct photoproduction .",
    "the numerical values are given in the appendix .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the values for @xmath31 and @xmath32 develop sizeable theoretical uncertainties . for the lowest bins with @xmath27  gev a rapidity - independent weighting factor",
    "is applied : @xmath33      the analytical calculations   differ from the calculations of the epvec mc generator  @xcite in several aspects which are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the differences are well understood and of the order of 10% in the total @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "one main difference between epvec and the above analytical calculations is the different separation between dis and photoproduction regimes .",
