    "bipolar outflows with velocities close to the speed of light are found in the nuclei of many active galaxies ( agn ) and are believed to be powered by a central engine consisting of a super massive black hole and an accretion disk . in previous papers we investigated the energy balance of these systems ( falcke , mannheim , biermann 1993 , ( fmb93 ) ; falcke & biermann 1994 ( paper i ) ; falcke , malkan , biermann 1994 , ( paper ii ) ; falcke , gopal - krishna , biermann 1994 ) and started with the basic hypothesis that jets and disks around compact accreting objects are symbiotic features .",
    "we found that a closely coupled jet / disk system can explain such a variety of phenomena as the uv / radio correlation of radio loud and radio weak quasars and the unusual radio properties of the galactic center source sgr a*. of course it is in principle not possible to prove the symbiotic nature of jets and disks ( i.e. that they are always both present ) but our aim is to check how far we can get with such an assumption and test it for as many different object classes as possible .",
    "recently , it was shown that the relativistic jet phenomenon can be found inside the galaxy as well , again in systems which are suspected to harbor ultra - compact central objects  most likely stellar mass black holes ( or neutron stars )  surrounded by accretion disks ( e.g. grs 1915 + 105 & gro j1655 - 40 ) .",
    "this was not unexpected within the framework of our approach and hence , we now want to apply our analysis of jet / disk systems to these objects as well and test if the previous found @xmath0/radio correlation for agn extends down to stellar mass black holes .",
    "the similarity between these galactic jet sources and agn is often stressed , but does this also have a physical foundation other than a pure morphological similarity ? are both engines powered by accretion onto a compact object producing radio jets ? if agn and and galactic jet sources were indeed to be of similar origin , they still should be understandable within the same simple physical description despite the scales being vastly different .",
    "such a very simple description was outlined in paper i and successfully tested in paper ii for agn and in fmb93 for sgr a *  already very different systems .",
    "there we were able to account for the observed properties by assuming that only a few important parameters  like the mass accretion rate and the black hole mass  change , while most others , like the ratio of jet power to disk luminosity or the fraction of relativistic electrons , remain largely scale invariant .",
    "we also found that indeed mass and energy conservation are serious constraints for coupled jet - disk systems and therefore imply interesting conclusions , e.g. about the energization of electrons .",
    "if we were to find similar results for the galactic jet sources then indeed one had more reason to believe in a physical relationship between galactic jet sources and agn .",
    "hence , in this paper we are not interested in a detailed modelling of individual sources but want to discuss our scenario introduced in paper i on the larger scale .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : we first will introduce the sources we are using ( sec .",

    "the characteristic effective temperature of accretion disks @xmath12 is fairly independent of the details of the viscosity mechanism and merely depends on the mass of the black hole @xmath13 and the accretion rate @xmath14 , the total disk luminosity @xmath0 depends on @xmath15 only and we have ( see e.g. falcke et al .",

    "quasars with supermassive black holes and high accretion rates for example can be found around @xmath28 erg / sec and @xmath29 k while solar mass black holes have @xmath30 erg / sec and @xmath31 k. in order to discuss a possible @xmath0/radio correlation over such a broad range of parameters it is not viable to simply compare one small frequency range with another : this may work for a homogenous class of objects like quasars , where an uv / radio correlation can be found , but going from quasars to stellar mass black holes one obviously has to shift from the uv to the x - ray regime ( eq .",
    "[ numax ] ) , where the bulk of the accretion disk luminosity is radiated .      in a series of paper ( fmb93 ;",
    "falcke et al .",
    "1993a ) ; paper i ; paper ii ; falcke et al . 1995b ; falcke 1994a&b ) we investigated the correlation between accretion disk luminosity ( @xmath0 ) and radio luminosity in quasars as well as in the galactic center source sgr a*. we found a tight correlation between @xmath0 and radio emission in radio loud and radio weak quasars ( paper ii ) and explained this as the consequence of a closely coupled jet / disk system in the nuclei of these galaxies . by adding mass and energy conservation in a jet / disk system to the classical blandford & knigl ( 1977 ) emission model for radio cores ( paper i ) we showed that any jet / disk coupling imposes serious constraints on the possible source parameters ( paper ii ) .",
    "the most important finding was that the total jet power @xmath32 is a substantial fraction of the disk luminosity @xmath33 as was already suggested in a seminal paper by rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) .",
    "this suggests that jet formation is directly coupled to the dissipation mechanism in the disk and occurs very close to the black hole ( paper i ) .    if we express the parameters of the jet radio emission in a scale invariant form and assume that the jet emission is caused by the overlap of synchrotron self - absorbed components in a conically shaped jet , fed by the accretion disk , and transporting a tangled magnetic field gradually declining as @xmath34 one obtains a flat total radio spectrum ( paper i , eq .",
    "57 ) from one jet cone    @xmath35    here , it is assumed that magnetic field , turbulent motion and relativistic particles ( @xmath36 ) are in equipartition and form a relativistic plasma with maximal sound speed .",
    "the latter requires also equipartition between kinetic and internal energy .",
    "maximal _ jet ( see paper i ) is the radiatively most efficient type of jet one can get for a given total jet power @xmath37 , and as we showed in paper ii less efficient jet models fail to explain the radio emission of radio loud quasars .",
    "we now only assume that the total jet power scales with the disk luminosity ( @xmath38 ) and thus obtain eq .",
    "[ lnu ] .",
    "the parameters introduced are the ratio of jet power to disk luminosity @xmath39 , the disk luminosity @xmath40 erg / sec , the ratio between the number density of relativistic electrons to the number density of protons @xmath41 ( without pair creation @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 is the minimum lorentz factor of the electrons , @xmath44 the angle between jet - axis and the line of sight , @xmath45 is the doppler factor of the jet , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are bulk velocity and lorentz factor of the jet .",
    "the reason for the non - linear dependence of @xmath48 on @xmath33 is simply due to the fact that the synchrotron emissivity in the equipartition case depends non - linearly on the magnetic field energy density ; in addition there is a minor effect induced by different spectral shapes for different electron energy distributions which we assume to be a powerlaw with exponent 2 .    for an edge - on system of two jet cones in the galaxy ( d=8.5 kpc ) we get ( ignoring doppler boosting and inclination effects , setting @xmath49 as in paper ii )",
    "@xmath50    the physical scale corresponding to this flux and cm wavelengths is    @xmath51    which is of the right order for radio weak sources .",
    "one has to note that @xmath52 corresponds to a distance where the jet becomes optically thick at the specified frequency .",
    "this has to be taken into account when one discusses radio outbursts and ejection of blobs .",
    "although an evolving single blob is not really properly described by our emission model , the best comparison between the radio flux at one frequency and the model will be possible at that point in time where the blob spectrum turns over and becomes optically thick at this frequency . the blob evolution seen by vlbi and vla usually depicts later stages of the evolution .",
    "when comparing those highly time dependent events with our stationary model one also has to consider that there may be different time scales involved for the jet and the disk ( battery effect ) , hence , the relation eq .",
    "( [ lnu ] ) may be violated in strong outbursts . in the comparison of outburst stages with the would - be - stationary calculation",
    "large time scale differences should show up as strong deviations from the model .",
    "we now shortly discuss the various parameters entering the model :      for quasars we found ( paper ii ) that the ratio between jet power and disk luminosity was around @xmath53 .",
    "substantially lower jet powers were not able to explain radio loud jet cores  even with the most efficient models . as we assume that this parameter reflects an universal jet / disk coupling mechanism , we will keep that value fixed in the further discussion .      in paper",
    "ii we discussed the possibility of a scaling of the proper jet velocity with disk luminosity but did not find a strong effect .",
    "however , we found that a weak power - law dependence with exponent @xmath54 is quite consistent with the data ( paper ii , eq .",
    "in contrast to quasars we know the jet velocities in the galactic superluminal sources quite well which are in the range ( 0.7 - 0.9)c and we can fix the velocities at the measured values . to faciliate a smooth transition from agn to galactic jets",
    "we therefore slightly modify the scaling law to    @xmath55    the previously used pure powerlaw would have predicted @xmath56 for systems with @xmath57 which is still in the right ball - park but slightly too low to produce the relativistic effects in grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 . at present",
    "we do not attribute any physical significance to this scaling law , use it mainly for practical reasons and will not adjust the correct value for each individual source as the changes due to a different jet speed in the regime @xmath58 are smaller than the overall uncertainties of the model .",
    "choosing a relativistic electron content of the jet with @xmath59 would correspond to a situation where the jet is already very energetic , however , the radiative efficiency is limited by the number of available electrons in the flow which have all been accelerated into a power law distribution .",
    "neither magnetic field nor the number of electrons can be further increased without violating energy and mass - conservation in the jet / disk system to produce more radio emission even though the electrons are not yet in equipartition .",
    "one can only alter the distribution of the electrons by raising their number by additional pair - creation ( @xmath60 , e.g. mixed or pure electron / positron jet ) or injecting the electrons already at a high energy where they become energetically dominant ( @xmath61 , see paper i ) .",
    "the latter is what must happen somehow in radio loud quasars ( paper ii ) and applied to eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) means that one may expect fluxes of @xmath62 mjy up to a few jy for the eddington limit of stellar mass black holes .    in paper",
    "ii we tentatively identified a maximal jet with @xmath63 & @xmath64 ( all electrons accelerated from thermal pool but only protons are in equipartition with the magnetic field ) as the radio quiet state and @xmath65 ( electrons and protons in equipartition with magnetic field , electrons injected at high energies ) as the radio loud state  both are natural states within any jet model .",
    "the radio loud model is the radiatively most efficient situation and for a given @xmath66 also is the upper limit to the possible radio emission - one would strongly suspect that @xmath67 in a normal system .",
    "one way to obtain the injection of synchrotron radiating particles at @xmath68 and make jets radio loud can be the pion - decay in hadronic cascades which in turn could be initiated by @xmath69 collisions of relativistic protons in the jet with thermal protons in the shear layer between jet and surrounding medium ( see paper i&ii , falcke 1995 ) .",
    "[ jd3-fig1.ps ]      we now want to apply our scaling laws ( eq . [ lnu ] ) to the galactic radio jets and compare them with other known jet sources .",
    "we will take the same model as in paper ii with just the parameters used to describe the radio / uv correlation in quasars ( `` maximal '' radio loud and radio weak jets with @xmath49 and @xmath70 ) .    the width of the model prediction ( fig .",
    "[ correlation ] ) is determined by the spread of possible inclination angles in conjunction with relativistic boosting .",
    "the shaded band limits the range between 15 and 90 degree , while the thin line represents the 0 degree inclination case . as",
    "this spread is smaller for lower jet velocities ( @xmath71 ) those models are simply contained within the range of the presented model .",
    "one should remember that for quasars the lower part of each band is probably not populated because of obscuration by a torus .",
    "the bend in the bands reflects the turnover from highly to mildly relativistic jets .",
    "figure [ correlation ] was already presented in falcke ( 1994 )  before the discovery of the superluminal sources and the determination of their velocities  for slightly lower jet velocities , but despite the bands being somewhat narrower it already represented the same basic results .",
    "the next step is to compare @xmath0 and radio core fluxes for the different object types with the basic jet model .",
    "we first reproduced fig .",
    "3a from paper ii , where we compared uv - bump and vla radio cores of a quasar sample with the model of paper i , and extended the plot range to very low disk luminosities .",
    "moreover , we added sgr a * and m31 * as already discussed in falcke et al .",
    "( 1993a ) , fmb93 and falcke & heinrich ( 1994 ) .",
    "we then estimated the disk luminosities for the galactic jet sources grs 1915 + 105 , gro j1655 - 40 , and 1e1740 - 2942 from their x - ray observations where we differentiated between high and low states if required .",
    "the accretion disk luminosity of ss433 was already extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "those numbers are given in table 1 and more detailed comments and references for the individual sources are given in the appendix .",
    "in additoin we collected the 5ghz flat spectrum core fluxes of the jets corresponding to the sources in their different states as listed in table 1 and discussed in the appendix . for the outburst sources",
    "we either took the peak x - ray luminosities and the flux when the spectrum appeared flat at 5 ghz in an outburst .",
    "we then did the same for the x - ray binaries .",
    "when several datapoints of a variable source were available we choose the logarithmic mean value of the radio flux ( in low and high states respectively ) as we did in paper ii already .",
    "the combined plot of these sources together with the model is shown in figure [ correlation ] .",
    "one can see that in fact most sources directly fall in the predicted range and none really is far off , only sco x-1 seems to have a somewhat low radio flux compared to ist x - ray luminosity .",
    "the sources also seem to be divided into two branches separated by roughly 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "_ considering the uncertainties we at least can positively state that each of those sources could in principle be explained by a jet model within the constraints of mass and energy conservation in a coupled jet / disk system as outlined in paper i. _    to highlight the separation of the two branches , we calculated the ratio between the disk luminosity and the radio luminosity at 5 ghz for each source ( table 1 ) , yielding something like the @xmath72 parameter used in the description of radio loudness of quasars .",
    "we plotted this @xmath72 parameter versus the disk luminosity of the sources ( fig .",
    "[ logr ] ) ; there indeed appears to be a separation into a radio loud branch with @xmath73 and a radio weak branch with @xmath74 .    in fig .",

    "the latter are located at the uppermost end of the model which is consistent with them being relativistically boosted . having the warning in mind that for this source we compare a time dependent outburst with a stationary model we may have another factor besides boosting that may lead to an enhancement of the radio emission . in the low states both jet sources are well within the model predictions where the low radio state of grs 1915 + 105 even falls completely onto the radio weak branch while the case for gro j1655 - 40 remains less clear due to the non - detection in x - rays .",
    "cyg x-3 remains radio loud even in the low state .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ jd3-fig2.ps ]",
    "in paper i we derived a simple jet model by adding mass and energy conservation in a jet / disk system to a simple sychrotron emission model of jets first developed by blandford & knigl ( 1979 ) .",
    "this model is derived from first principles and is fairly universal as it simply describes the dependence of a synchrotron emitting jet source on simple plasma parameter . by parametrization of this model in terms of the power available in an accretion disk",
    "thought to power the jet , we obtained a model which does not have an intrinsic scale other than the power of the accretion disk .",
    "therefore we suggested that it should be applicable to all types of radio jets .",
    "and indeed it was possible to use the same kind of model for a low power jet source like sgr a * and and high power sources like quasars .",
    "we have now extended this analysis and compared the overall radio properties of the cores of galactic jet sources and x - ray binaries with their disk luminosity .",
    "we again find a trend of increasing radio luminosity with increasing disk power .",
    "there also appears to be a separation in radio loud and radio weak sources .",
    "while the radio loud sources have an @xmath72-ratio between radio luminosity at 5 ghz and disk luminosity of @xmath75 , radio weak sources have @xmath76 .",
    "given the large offset between radio loud and radio weak this dichotomy should prevail even if some of the measurements were in error , but considering the small number of sources and their ill defined selection criterion we can not exclude that this is caused by a selection effect .",
    "nevertheless , this is reminiscent of the situation in quasars and may be an interesting trail to be followed in future research .",
    "so far gro j1655 - 40 , cyg x-3 , sgr a * , and m31 * appear to be radio loud , while sco x-1 , cyg x-1 , cyg x-2 , 1e1740 - 2942 and ss433 appear radio weak .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 is the only source that varied by a factor 1000 while its x - ray luminosity was roughly constant and therefore moved from the radio loud branch in the high state to the radio weak branch in the low state .    comparing the luminosities with our model prediction we found that , like quasars , galactic jet sources and our x - ray binaries can as well be explained within the same simple physical description of an outwards moving , synchrotron emitting plasma in a radio jet being fed by an accretion disk .",
    "interestingly , the same intrinsic model parameters as used for extragalactic jets have to be used for galactic jet sources as well .",
    "these parameters are the ratio between jet power and disk luminosity which must be very high ( @xmath77 ) , the minimum lorentz factor of the radiating electrons which has to be @xmath62 for the radio loud sources ( or alternatively 100 fold more particles by pair creation ) and the state of the plasma which has to be near relativistic and near its equipartition value ( between magnetic field and relativistic particles ) - only jet velocities seem to be slightly smaller in low power jets than in quasars .",
    "thus the radio loud galactic jet sources are already in the most efficient state as far as their radio emission is concerned which means that we have no freedom any more in choosing the plasma parameters .",
    "the similarity in the physical conditions in galactic and extragalactic jets shows that they very likely have also a physical link beyond mere morphological similarity  they seem to have similar engines differing only in size and power .",
    "thus it is no coincidence that both types of engines are usually interpreted as compact accreting objects . in our formulation",
    "the nature of this compact object is irrelevant and should be valid for black holes , neutron stars and perhaps even t tauri stars .",
    "however , if like in stellar wind theory , the terminal jet velocity scales somehow with the escape velocity at the sonic point  which usually is close to the base of the jet / wind  the terminal velocity could be a function primarily of the compact object . rapidly rotating kerr holes with high escape speeds",
    "would thus require relativistic jets while neutron stars or schwarzschild holes with lower escape speeds would require only mildly relativistic jets , stars would produce jets with only subrelativistic speeds . as the escape velocity close to a black hole at a fixed dimensionless radius @xmath78 is the same irrespective of the central mass @xmath13 we could understand why the jet velocities in galactic and extragalactic jets are so similar despite 8 - 10 powers of ten difference in mass and mass accretion between both types .",
    "one may speculate  as we did in paper i  that indeed jets are quite naturally associated with compact accreting objects but come in two flavors  radio weak and radio loud  depending on the energization of electrons .",
    "we propsed previously that those states could correspond to the situation where a ) the thermal electrons ( @xmath79 ) are smoothly accelerated into a powerlaw distribution b ) electrons ( or pairs ) are shifted upwards in energy until the equipartition value is reached yielding a minimum lorentz factor for the electrons of @xmath68 .",
    "we note that one process that can inject pairs at such a high energy is the pion decay in hadronic cascades ( see falcke 1995 , falcke et al .",
    "1995 , biermann et al .",
    "1995 for examples ) .",
    "this connection between galactic and extragalactic jets is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ correlation ] where the same jet emission model smoothly connects high power and low power sources .",
    "although we still do not have enough sources to firmly claim a @xmath0/radio correlation for galactic jet sources the results are already very promising .",
    "the hunch of a universal @xmath0/radio correlation for compact accreting objects extending from agn down to stellar mass black holes as implied by paper i&ii and fmb93 is still consistent with all sources we tested .",
    "a future step to firmly establish such a correlation will be to investigate supermassive black hole candidates at intermediate powers between stellar mass black holes and agn in nearby galactic nuclei and low - power seyfert galaxies . in this sense",
    "one should understand fig . 1 as a prediction for these sources .",
    "it is interesting that also the sources where it is not yet rigorously shown that the radio emission is caused by jets like sgr a * , m31 * , cyg x-3 and the other x - ray binaries mix with those sorces where there obviously are jets ( ss433 , 1e1740 - 2942 , gro j1655 - 40 , grs 1915 + 105 ) .",
    "this shows that the former can also easily be explained by a simple jet model but does of course not yet prove the existence of jets there .",
    "the observation that cyg x-2 moves up and down within the radio weak band indicates that our treatment is indeed too simplified for a detailed discussion of the sources but on the large scale we still expect that further putative galactic jet sources will fall within the bands predicted by our model .",
    "we finally conclude that the comparison of the flat spectrum core flux of compact accreting objetcs with their putative disk luminosity  the peak in the spectral energy distribution  may become a very powerful tool for the analysis and classification of such systems .",
    "what has to be done next is to extend the @xmath0/radio data set for compact accreting objects of stellar mass size in high and low states , and closely monitor the evolution of the superluminal jet sources to prove or disprove the notion of a universal @xmath0/radio correlation and the possible radio loud / radio weak dichotomy for galactic jet sources .    _",

    "this , however , is not too surprising if one remembers that ss 433 is in a close binary system and quite probably surrounded by a thick , super - critical accretion torus and therefore may have completely different radiation characteristics then a ` normal ' , sub - critical thin disks .",

    "the discussion of the corresponding radio data is somewhat more complicated as it requires to disentangle the various contributions of this highly variable source .",

    "the vlbi data show a central core with 5 ghz fluxes in the range 22 - 190 mjy and total fluxes between 102 and 411 mjy , from the monitoring data one finds that flat spectrum flares can reach up to 800 mjy .",
    "one might label all three contributions as coming from the core and to be consistent with all other datasets and our model we will stick with the ( geometric ) mean vla core fluxes ( hjellming & johnston 1981 ) as used in paper ii yielding @xmath92 jy for ss 433 , quite consistent with the total flux of the vlbi structure .",
    "cyg x-1 shows a relatively constant mean radio flux with a flat spectrum around 15 mjy ( hjellming et al 1975 ) and an average x - ray luminosity of @xmath93 erg / sec ( liang & nolan 1984 ) , the variations in both bands are usually less than a factor 2 .",
    "cyg x-2 has a low state and a flaring state roughly corresponding to 5 ghz fluxes between 0.5 mjy and 4 mjy with peaks up to 12 mjy ( hjellming et al .",
