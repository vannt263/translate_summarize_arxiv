    "this assumption arises naturally in many applications such as mass - spectrometry @xcite , text mining @xcite , clustering @xcite , audio processing @xcite or hyperspectral imaging @xcite .",
    "indeed , spectra are often measured as intensities ( electromagnetic spectra for instance ) or in terms of a whole number of elements ( molecules in mass - spectrometry ) which are necessarily non - negative .",

    "the regularization penalizes large differences between a sample and its neighbors and therefore tends to privilege smooth estimates of the sources .",

    "the source in figure [ fig : lactose ] is indeed sparse since it is composed of few large coefficients and many close to null coefficients .",
    "algorithms have then been designed to recover such signals in nmf and stressed that sparsity could indeed help perform more relevant factorizations @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "sparsity is enforced by further constraining the @xmath43 norm of the sources as follows : @xmath44 in @xcite , hoyer uses a gradient descent for @xmath36 and a multiplicative update procedure for @xmath29 . in sparse hals @xcite columns of @xmath36 and rows of @xmath29 are updated one by one , which leads to simple and efficient updates .",

    "it is defined as follows : @xmath50    if these algorithms are able to deal with spiky data , they do not take into account the continuity of source [ fig : lactose ] .",
    "none of the aforementioned nmf algorithms is therefore able to use all the prior information about the sources . in order to better model this kind of signals",

    "indeed , the sparsity of a signal depends on the basis or dictionary of waveforms in which it is expressed ( see @xcite ) . in a nutshell , bases that best capture the geometric structure of a signal",
    "will yield sparser representations of this signal .",
    "sparsity - enforcing priors in transformed domains have been used with success to solve a very wide range of inverse problems ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in nmf however , few algorithms have been proposed to enforce sparsity in a different basis or dictionary , because of the difficulty in dealing with two different priors in two different domains . to our knowledge",
    ", only @xcite has attempted to impose sparsity in a transformed domain .",
    "however this study is limited to imposing sparsity in an orthonormal basis .",

    "the ngmca framework , which will be detailed in section  [ sec : ngmca ] , has been shown to yield efficient separation performance while providing an effective rule of thumb on how to set the sparsity parameter . however , it was so far limited to imposing sparsity in the direct domain .    in section ",
    "[ sec : transformed_ngmca ] , the ngmca algorithm is extended to tackle sparsity in general transformed domains , either in orthonormal or redundant dictionary of waveforms .",
    "we further tackle the most common types of sparse priors in a transformed domain , namely the synthesis and the analysis formulations which , to the best of our knowledge , have never been compared in the context of nmf .",
    "numerical comparisons with state - of - the - art nmf algorithms on noisy mixtures of simulated nmr spectra are carried out .",
    "@xmath43-type priors yield estimation biases which can generally be neglected when the sources to be retrieved are very sparse ( _ e.g. _ nmr and mass spectra ) .",
    "however for mildly sparse signals , such as natural images , the estimation bias related to the use of the @xmath43 norm hampers dramatically the performance . to alleviate this major issue , section  [ sec : reweighted - l1 ]",
    "presents an extension of the ngmca algorithm which handles reweighted sparse priors @xcite .",

    "ngmca @xcite was designed as an extension of gmca @xcite to tackle nmf as formulated in problem .",
    "the main steps of the algorithm are provided in * algorithm [ alg : ngmca]*. each subproblem ( lines 4 and 5 ) is solved at optimality , since it was observed through extensive experiments that optimally managing the priors enhances the separation performances ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an important feature of this algorithm is the decreasing @xmath43 regularization strategy .",
    "this kind of technique , inspired from simulated annealing , is also used in nmf with a decreasing @xmath61 or @xmath62 regularizations @xcite . in ngmca , it consists in starting with large thresholds @xmath63 so that the algorithm first estimates the mixing matrix from the entries of the sources which have the highest amplitude . assuming that these large coefficients are likely to belong to only one source , they can indeed provide a descent separation .",
    "next , the thresholds are decreased at each iteration in order to refine the solution .",
    "the final thresholds are set independently for each source at @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is an online estimate of the noise level in the @xmath66 row of the gradient .",
    "this prevents most of the noise from altering the solution .",
    "the decrease of the thresholds is chosen to be linear , decreasing each threshold by a close to constant amount down to @xmath64 .      in @xcite , in order to allow the convergence of the algorithm , @xmath63 is kept fixed during the last iterations .",
    "an additional constraint is also added to the update of @xmath36 ( line 5 of * algorithm [ alg : ngmca ] * ) in order to thwart the scale indeterminacy :    @xmath67    the full cost function of the problem it aims at solving is then : @xmath68 the minimization of this cost function is carried out here using block coordinate descent , i.e. minimizing alternately the subproblems in @xmath36 and @xmath29 . for this type of algorithm ,",
    "tseng @xcite provided convergence conditions when the cost function is not differentiable .",
    "one of the conditions is that the levelsets of the cost function must be compact .",
    "this is the case for @xmath69 thanks to the additional constraint , indeed :    * the level sets of @xmath69 are closed , as the inverse images of closed sets of a continuous function .",
    "* they are also bounded in @xmath29 thanks to the @xmath43 regularization , and in @xmath36 thanks to the norm constraint on the columns of @xmath36 .",
    "hence , as closed and bounded sets of a finite space , they are compact . also , the data fidelity term @xmath70 is differentiable on its domain , its domain is open , @xmath69 is continuous , and the subproblem in @xmath36 is pseudoconvex ( since it is convex ) .",
    "this permits to use theorem 4.1(b ) of @xcite which proves that the coordinate descent method with the cyclic rule converges to a stationary point of @xmath69 .",
    "more details are provided in example 6.4 of @xcite which is closely related to the present settings .",
    "in order to solve the subproblems at lines 4 and 5 , ngmca makes use of a proximal splitting method , namely the forward - backward algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is able to tackle problems which take the following form : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a convex and differentiable function ; and @xmath73 is a non - differentiable proper convex and lower semi - continuous function .",
    "it alternates between local minimization of @xmath72 and of @xmath73 until convergence , which occurs under mild assumptions . to do so",
    ", the algorithm requires the gradient of @xmath72 and the proximal operator of @xmath73 .",

    "the exact same reweighting procedure is used for the synthesis formulation while it may not be as well suited in this case .",

    "are set to 0 . in the same vein",
    ", the coarse scale does not generally contain discriminative information .",
