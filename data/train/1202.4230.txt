    "nucleation is a fluctuation - driven process that initiates the decay of a metastable state into a more stable one @xcite .",
    "it is usually involved in first - order phase transitions and along with growth of a new phase @xcite .",
    "many important phenomena in nature , including crystallization @xcite , fractures @xcite , glass formation @xcite , and protein folding @xcite , to list just a few , are associated with nucleation . despite much attention , many aspects of nucleation processes in complex systems are still unclear and deserve more investigation .    the ising model is a paradigm for many phenomena in statistical physics .",
    "it has also been widely used to study the nucleation process .",
    "for instance , in two - dimensional lattices , allen _ et al _ discovered that shear can enhance the nucleation rate and the rate peaks at an intermediate shear rate @xcite .",
    "sear found that a single impurity may considerably enhance the nucleation rate @xcite .",
    "page and sear reported that the existence of a pore may lead to two - stage nucleation , and the overall nucleation rate can reach a maximum level at an intermediate pore size @xcite . the nucleation pathway of the ising model in three - dimensional lattices has also been studied by sear and pan @xcite . in addition , the ising model has been frequently used to test the validity of classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , all these studies are limited to regular lattices in euclidean space .",
    "since many real systems can be properly modeled by network - organized structure @xcite , it is thus an interesting topic to explore nucleation process in complex networks .",
    "very recently , our group have studied nucleation dynamics on scale - free ( sf ) networks @xcite and modular networks @xcite . in these two papers",
    ", we mainly focused on the nucleation rate and system size effects .",
    "we found that , for sf networks , the nucleation rate decays exponentially with network size , while the critical nucleus size increases linearly .",
    "for modular networks , as the network modularity worsens the nucleation undergoes a transition from a two - step to one - step process and the nucleation rate shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the modularity .",
    "as we know , network topology could play important role in the system s dynamics , involving not only the stationary state , but also the detailed pathway .",
    "for instance , it was shown that network heterogeneity could drastically influence the path to oscillator synchronization @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , how network topology would influence the nucleation pathway has not been reported yet .",
    "motivated by this , we will study the different roles of network architectures in the formation of nucleating clusters , which can reveal the nucleation pathways of the ising model in the underlying networks .    since nucleation is an activated process",
    ", it can be extremely slow .",
    "therefore , direct simulations can take excessive amounts of time . to overcome this difficulty , in the present work , we adopt the forward flux sampling ( ffs ) @xcite approach proposed recently , which is efficient and easy to implement to study rare events .",
    "we employ erds - rnyi ( er ) and sf networks as the paradigm of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks respectively . by using ffs",
    ", we obtain lots of configurations at each interface along the nucleation pathway . from these configurations we scrutinize and compare the nucleating clusters in er and sf networks .",
    "it is found that the processes of forming the critical nucleus are qualitatively different between the two cases of networks .",
    "for the former , a dominant cluster arise firstly , and groups smaller clusters gradually , while for the latter , many small clusters emerge at first and then abruptly turn into the critical nucleus .",
    "interestingly , both the cluster size distributions follow power - law distributions and the slopes are nearly the same at early nucleation stage .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] presents the details of our simulation model and the numerical methods we employ to sampling the nucleation pathway .",
    "the numerical results are compared for sf networks and er ones in sec .",
    "a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "we consider the ising model on complex networks consisting of @xmath0 nodes .",
    "each node is endowed with a spin variable @xmath1 that can be either @xmath2 ( up ) or @xmath3 ( down ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the coupling constant and @xmath6 is the external magnetic field . for convenience , we set @xmath7 in the following discussions .",
    "the elements of the adjacency matrix of the network take @xmath8 if nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "the degree , that is the number of neighboring nodes , of node @xmath9 is defined as @xmath12    the system evolves in time according to single - spin - flip dynamics with metropolis acceptance probabilities @xcite , in which we attempt to flip each spin once , on average , during each monte carlo ( mc ) cycle . in each attempt ,",
    "a randomly chosen spin is flipped with the probability @xmath13 , where @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath16 the temperature , and @xmath17 is the energy change due to the flipping process . in the absence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "the system undergoes an order - disorder phase transition at the critical temperature . above the critical temperature , the system is disordered where up- and down - pointing spins are roughly equally abundant . below the critical temperature ,",
    "the system prefers to be in either of the two states : one state with predominantly up spins , and the other with almost down spins . in the presence of an external field ,",
    "one of these two states becomes metastable , and if initiated predominantly in this metastable state , the system will remain for a significantly long time before it undergoes a nucleation transition to the thermodynamically stable state .",
    "we are interested in the pathways for this transition .",
    "the ffs method has been successfully used to calculate rate constants and transition paths for rare events in equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems @xcite . for clarity , we describe the method again here , together with some relevant details with our work .",
    "this method uses a series of interfaces in phase space between the initial and final states to force the system from the initial state @xmath18 to the final state @xmath19 in a ratchetlike manner .",
    "before the simulation begins , an reaction coordinate @xmath20 is first defined , such that the system is in state @xmath18 if @xmath21 and it is in state @xmath19 if @xmath22 .",
    "a series of nonintersecting interfaces @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) lie between states @xmath18 and @xmath19 , such that any path from @xmath18 to @xmath19 must cross each interface without reaching @xmath25 before @xmath23 .",
    "the algorithm first runs a long - time simulation which gives an estimate of the flux escaping from the basin of @xmath18 and generates a collection of configurations corresponding to crossings of interface @xmath26 . the next step is to choose a configuration from this collection at random and use it to initiate a trial run which is continued until it either reaches @xmath27 or returns to @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 is reached , the configuration of the end point of the trial run is stored .",
    "this process is repeated , step by step , until @xmath28 is reached . for more detailed descriptions of the ffs method",
    "please see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will use ffs to study nucleation pathways of the equilibrium phase from the metastable spin phase . specifically , we let @xmath29 and start from an initial state with @xmath30 for most of the spins .",
    "we define the order parameter @xmath20 as the total number of up spins in the network .",
    "the spacing between adjacent interfaces is fixed at 3 up spins .",
    "we perform @xmath31 trials per interface for each ffs sampling , from which at least @xmath32 configurations are saved in order to investigate the statistical properties along the nucleation pathway .",
    "the results are obtained by averaging over @xmath33 independent ffs samplings and @xmath34 different network realizations .",
    "in what follows , we employ a barabsi - albert sf network , whose degree distribution follows a power law @xmath35 with the scaling exponent @xmath36 @xcite , and the well - known er random network .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present schematically the evolution of local nucleating clusters in er and sf networks at different stages ( for clarity only show 100 nodes ) . here",
    ", a nucleating cluster is defined as the component of connected nodes with up spins .",
    "qualitatively , it shows distinct features along nucleation stages . in the er case",
    ", there always exists a dominant cluster , which groups smaller ones gradually . while for sf networks , no dominant cluster appears at the early stage , but then a giant cluster emerges suddenly .",
    "this demonstrates that nucleation follows different pathways on er and sf networks , indicating that heterogeneity of the network topology may play an important role .",
    "for the two different topologies studied ( er and sf ) .",
    "these shown networks contain 100 nodes , in order to have a sizeable picture of the system .",
    "up spins and down spins are indicated by green circles and black circles , respectively .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    to further elucidate detailed characteristics along the nucleation pathway , we use ffs to generate configurations and perform detailed analysis on the nucleating clusters , including the largest cluster size , average degree of the cluster nodes , the number of clusters and cluster size distribution . according to cnt",
    ", there exists a critical nucleus size @xmath37 of the new phase , above which the system grows rapidly to the new phase .",
    "herein , we mainly focus on the nucleation stage where @xmath38 . in our simulation",
    ", we determine @xmath37 by computation of the committor probability @xmath39 , which is the probability of reaching the thermodynamic stable state before returning to the metastable state .",
    "as commonly reported in the literature @xcite , the critical nucleus appears at @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath37 are different for different networks , we thus introduce @xmath41 as the control parameter .",
    "for consistent comparison , we introduce @xmath42 as the ratio of the size of the largest nucleating cluster to over the total number of up spins , and plot @xmath42 ( averaged over the ensemble at each interface ) as functions of @xmath43 in fig.2 .",
    "clearly , one can see that @xmath42 for er networks is always larger than that for sf ones .",
    "specifically , at @xmath44 , @xmath42 is already more than @xmath45 for er networks , while it is only about @xmath46 for sf ones , as shown by the dashed gray lines in fig.2 .",
    "but when @xmath47 they almost tend to @xmath48 together .     of the largest cluster as functions of @xmath43 .",
    "parameters are @xmath49 , the average network degree @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    to show our results more explicitly , we investigate the average degree @xmath55 of the nodes inside the nucleating clusters , and plot @xmath55 as functions of @xmath56 in fig .",
    "as shown , @xmath55 increases monotonically with @xmath43 for both er and sf networks , which means the new phase tends to grow from those nodes with smaller degrees . for er networks",
    ", @xmath55 grows fast at the very beginning following by a relatively slow increasing .",
    "for sf networks , @xmath55 increases slowly at first and jumps sharply when approaching the critical nucleus .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] .     of new phase nodes as functions of @xmath43 .",
    "other parameters are the same as in fig.2 .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    to better understand the aforementioned differences , we present the number @xmath57 of the nucleating clusters as functions of @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath57 non - monotonically depends on @xmath43 and the numbers of clusters in sf networks are always more than that in er ones .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath57 for both networks approach the same magnitude near the formation of critical nucleus , but it decreases much more sharply in sf networks which is also consistent with the picture shown in fig.[fig1 ] to [ fig3 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , the cluster size distributions @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 are shown .",
    "interestingly , @xmath59 follow apparent power - law distributions in the small size range for both types of networks , and in addition , the exponents are nearly the same for fixed @xmath41 .",
    "the power law breaks in the large size range , where large clusters dominate .     of nucleating clusters as functions of @xmath43 .",
    "( b ) size distribution @xmath59 of nucleating clusters , on a log - log scale , @xmath62 denote the size of nucleating clusters .",
    "other parameters are the same as in fig.2 .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    the above results can be qualitatively understood in terms of cnt .",
    "cnt assumes that the formation of a nucleus lies in two competing factors : the bulk energy gain of creating a new up spin which favors the growth of the nucleus , and the interfacial energy cost , an opposing factor , which is due to the creation of new boundary links between up and down spins .",
    "that is , the change of free energy @xmath63 may be written as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes the effective interfacial free energy , which mainly depends on the average number of boundary links that an up - spin node has . obviously , a node with more boundary links is more difficult to change its spin state .",
    "for sf networks , it is thus always easier for the leaf nodes with small degrees to change state than the hubs with large degrees . since the degree distribution follows power - law ,",
    "there exist a lot of hubs with intermediate degrees , as well as a few hubs with very large degrees .",
    "usually , many leaf nodes are connected to relatively small hubs , which are further connected to large hubs .",
    "therefore , only small nucleating clusters , consisted of leaf nodes and small hubs , can form at the early stage of the nucleation process .",
    "these small clusters are either away from each other on the network or separated by those crucial hubs with very large degrees . in the final stage of the nucleation ,",
    "once the crucial hubs connecting these small clusters change their states , a giant nucleation cluster will emerge abruptly .",
    "this picture is consistent with those results shown in the above figures . for er networks , however , the degree distribution follows poisson distribution and no crucial hub exists , such that those new - formed clusters are usually connected together and one would not expect a sharp increase in the cluster size , which is observed in sf networks .",
    "in summary , we have studied nucleation pathways of the ising model with metropolis spin - flip dynamics in er and sf networks using the ffs method .",
    "concerning the former , there always exists a dominant cluster which groups small clusters gradually until the critical nucleus is formed ; while concerning the latter , many isolated small clusters grow separately which suddenly merge together into the critical nucleus .",
    "we have performed detailed analysis involving the nucleating clusters along the nucleation pathway , including the cluster size as well as its distribution , the mean degree inside the cluster , and so on , to further demonstrate the above scenario .",
    "the distinct nucleation pathways between er and sf networks further emphasize the very role of network topology .",
    "our study may provide a valuable understanding of how first - order phase transitions take place on complex networks , which could be of great importance not only for physical systems , but also for social and biological networks .",
