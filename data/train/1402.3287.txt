    "for example , the hawking mass of a spherically symmetric sphere in the schwarzschild spacetime of mass @xmath44 is precisely @xmath44 , which is one of the main motivations for this definition .    in other examples , however , the hawking mass may greatly overestimate or underestimate any reasonable notion of how much mass is inside a surface . for example , consider a round sphere in the @xmath45 slice of the minkowski spacetime ( which represents vacuum ) .",
    "this sphere has zero hawking mass , which is reasonable .",
    "the gauss  bonnet theorem may be used to prove that any closed , connected surface in the @xmath45 hypersurface has nonpositive hawking mass , and negative hawking mass unless the surface is a round sphere .",
    "this beautiful fact implies that the total mass of the @xmath45 hypersurface of the minkowski spacetime , which is zero , is bounded below by the hawking mass of any connected closed surface in this hypersurface .",
    "even more remarkably , huisken and ilmanen proved that the total mass of a hypersurface with zero second fundamental form in a spacetime with nonnegative energy density is bounded below by the hawking mass of any connected surface which bounds a finite region in the hypersurface and is not enclosed by a surface of equal or less area @xcite .",
    "this highly nontrivial result relies on a monotonicity formula for the hawking mass @xcite under inverse mean curvature flow , as well as the corresponding existence and asymptotics results for the flow @xcite .    a natural question , then",
    ", is to wonder if a similar result could be true for the hawking mass of surfaces in a spacetime that are not necessarily contained in a hypersurface with zero second fundamental form .",
    "returning to the minkowski spacetime example , explicit calculation shows that adding `` squiggles '' to a round sphere in the @xmath45 slice in timelike directions can increase the hawking mass",
    ". in particular , the hawking mass can be positive and hence too large to be a lower bound for the total mass of the spacetime , which is zero .",
    "thus , if we want the hawking mass of a surface to be a lower bound for the total mass of a spacetime , we can not allow surfaces with arbitrary timelike squiggles in them . in the prequel ,",

    "in this section we analyze conditions of the type @xmath249 that ensure monotonicity of the hawking mass for a uniformly area expanding family of surfaces .",
    "we start with the following lemma .",
    "[ sufficient ] let @xmath250 be a closed riemannian manifold .",
    "let @xmath251 be scalar functions on @xmath2 with @xmath252 and @xmath40 and @xmath7 a vector field on @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath253 where @xmath254 and @xmath255 satisfies @xmath256 then @xmath257      define @xmath258 let @xmath259 be the coordinate in @xmath260 and prime the derivative with respect to @xmath259 .",
    "define @xmath261 as any positive solution of @xmath262 introduce also a positive scalar function @xmath263 and a vector field @xmath95 by @xmath264 inserting this decomposition into ( [ defa ] ) yields , after using ( [ defb ] ) , @xmath265 rewriting the last term gives : @xmath266 \\circ \\beta + { \\text{div}}_{\\sigma } \\left ( \\beta ( v \\circ \\beta ) \\nablah \\beta + \\beta y \\right ) .",
    "\\label{cala3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , for any function @xmath267 and vector field @xmath96 on @xmath2 , we have the immediate identity @xmath268 let @xmath269 , with @xmath270 so that ( [ identity1 ] ) transforms into @xmath271 choosing @xmath272 to satisfy @xmath273 we can insert ( [ identity2 ] ) into ( [ cala3 ] ) to find @xmath274 from which it follows that conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) imply @xmath275 , by the divergence theorem .",
    "we can now apply this lemma to find sufficient conditions for the monotonicity of the hawking mass for a uniformly area expanding family of surfaces .",
    "recall first that for any orthonormal basis @xmath276 with @xmath277 spacelike , the associated connection one - form is defined as @xmath278 oriented orthonormal bases @xmath279 of the normal bundle , with outward - spacelike @xmath280 , are in one - to - one correspondence with smooth functions @xmath281 according to @xmath282 recall ( equation ( 3.3 ) of @xcite ) that the connection one - form @xmath283 relates to @xmath284 as @xmath285    [ prop_suff ] consider a uniformly area expanding family of surfaces with orthogonal flow vector @xmath286 and let @xmath287 .",
    "the hawking mass is monotonic along this flow provided @xmath288 , where @xmath289 or @xmath290 and @xmath291 is any nondecreasing function .",
    "the case @xmath292 in ( [ case1 ] ) corresponds to the time flat case of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "the case @xmath293 in ( [ case2 ] ) , i.e. when @xmath294 , was first discussed in @xcite . as follows from the proof below , the two sets ( [ case1 ] ) and ( [ case2 ] ) are disjoint .",
    "the only subcase that places no restrictions on @xmath32 is the time flat condition @xmath295 .",
    "suppose in case ( [ case1 ] ) the function @xmath296 is chosen .",
    "then the hyperbolic angle from @xmath116 to @xmath297 is @xmath298 . by ( [ connectiontransform ] ) , @xmath299 the divergence - free condition that guarantees monotonicity reduces to the following poisson equation for @xmath32 : @xmath300      for any @xmath304 , we consider the basis of normal vectors @xmath305 defined by @xmath306 the choice @xmath307 implies @xmath308 as a consequence ( [ connectiontransform ] ) , where @xmath95 is defined by ( [ decomu ] ) .",
    "thus , lemma [ sufficient ] with @xmath309 shows that the condition @xmath310 ensures monotonicity of the hawking mass mass of a uniformly area expanding family of surfaces provided @xmath311 satisfies @xmath312 this is equivalent to ( i ) @xmath313 or ( ii ) @xmath314 . in case ( i ) , let @xmath315 and monotonicity for the class ( [ case1 ] ) is proved . in case ( ii ) , let @xmath316 , so that @xmath317 and ( [ defnuf ] ) becomes @xmath318 from ( [ vecxi ] ) , @xmath319 which proves monotonicity for the class ( [ case2 ] ) ."
