    "the steady - state subspace is therefore spanned by @xmath125 as well as optional pure states corresponding to nontrivial solutions of @xmath124 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that pure state @xmath126 can be a steady state of lindblad equation iff it is an eigenvector of all @xmath5 as well as of @xmath127 . using schmidt decomposition @xmath128",

    "this maximum can be reached only if there is a single lindblad operator ( two different pauli matrices do not have a common eigenvector ) , e.g. @xmath133 , and therefore two @xmath29 are zero . on the other hand , for nonzero shift length @xmath134 at most one @xmath29 can be zero . as a consequence , in the limit of small nonzero shift @xmath135 the optimal singlet fraction can be shown to be @xmath136 .",

    "such optimal @xmath107 can not be obtained exactly at @xmath162 , but only in the limit of @xmath163 , which , however , poses no serious obstacles , see appendix  [ app : a ] . as we see , local non - unital dissipation can create mixed entangled steady - states , even though it can not create pure entangled steady - states . without the locality constraint considered in this work it is , of course , always possible to mitigate entanglement destruction by specific dissipation , like for instance when a common environment is coupled to non - interacting systems  @xcite , or for high - temperature entanglement in driven  @xcite or steady states  @xcite .",
    "the fact that maximal singlet fraction @xmath164 is bounded away from @xmath75 has some important implications . for hamiltonians",
    "whose non - degenerate ground - state has an overlap with a maximally entangled state larger than @xmath164 , using only local dissipation one can not `` cool '' the systems down to its ground state . for such @xmath112",
    "there is a fundamental limit to local quantum cooling  a minimal temperature below which one can not cool .",
    "note that in classical setting , using local cooling by e.g. langevin bath , there are no obstacles to the lowest attainable energy . in the setting",
    "studied this improves on various unattainability results for certain specific situations  @xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence is that the steady - state @xmath111 can put a constraint on a possible dissipation , even if nothing is known about @xmath112 or @xmath114 , namely , if @xmath111 is larger than @xmath164 , we immediately know that dissipation can not be local . also , the maximal @xmath111 is very sensitive to unitality . for strictly unital local dissipation it is @xmath132 , whereas for infinitesimally weak violation of unitality it drops to @xmath136 .",
    "we expect similar results about lowest attainable energy to hold also for more than 2-qubit systems provided dissipation acts locally on only part of a system .",
    "the reason is that local dissipation has only a limited influence on non - local quantum correlations . as a simple example , for an @xmath12-qubit heisenberg chain and 1-qubit dissipation one can show that a non - degenerate steady state is always separable and",
    "therefore there is again a temperature `` gap '' .",
    "we have efficiently geometrically characterized single - qubit lindblad dissipators , opening the door for various optimizations involving local dissipation . to demonstrate its applicability",
