    "besides the static ( i.e. , equal - time ) correlation functions , this formalism allows one to calculate also dynamical correlations in imaginary time @xmath24 that can be computed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are two coordinates of the path such that @xmath28 .",
    "a probabilistic interpretation of the previous expectation values  ( [ eq : obeta ] ) ,  ( [ eq : energybeta ] ) , and  ( [ eq : cabtau ] ) can be immediately recovered whenever @xmath29 for all configurations @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , in this case , @xmath20 can be interpreted as a probability distribution that may be readily sampled by using monte carlo algorithms .",

    "one of the most striking differences between the original formulation of the rqmc on the continuum and the present formulation on the lattice is the lack of the discretization error appearing in the trotter decomposition of the propagator .",

    "@xcite nonetheless , it is often of great interest to remove such a limitation ( whose result is biased by the quality of the variational wave function ) and a dedicated sampling strategy has to be devised in order to cope with such a need . in the following ,",
    "we show that a relatively easy modification of the sampling scheme can accomplish this task , providing us with a general tool to compute ground - state averages of operators that are non local in the chosen basis @xmath35 .",

    "as anticipated , it clearly emerges from fig .",
    "[ fig : effic ] that the two algorithms do not have exactly the same behavior at @xmath239 , the maximum efficiency of the directed updates being reached for lower values of @xmath241 .",
    "this feature is due to the fact that when @xmath241 is very close to its saturation value , then a single markov step can consist of a conspicuous number of individual `` sliding moves '' . even if this situation leads to a fast decorrelation of configurations it also leads to a rarefaction of the possibility to measure the desired observables , which can eventually take place only at the end of the markov step and not during the individual moves .",
    "this leads to a worse efficiency if compared to the bounce algorithm , where measurements can be in principle done after every sliding move .    in conclusion ,",
    "the performances of the two algorithms are very close , although some advantages may arise from the use of the directed - updates .",
    "we further notice that the purely markovian approach introduced in this paper could be slightly more efficient in cases where the number of rejected configurations by the bounce algorithm is substantial whereas _ all _ the generated configurations are accepted in the directed update scheme ."
