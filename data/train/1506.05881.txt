    "asymptotic freedom property of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) allows rigorous perturbative calculations of transport coefficients to be done at temperatures high compared to the qcd scale @xmath4 .",
    "recent work over the last two decades has resulted in the calculation of transport coefficients to leading order in the strong coupling constant for high temperature qcd  @xcite .",
    "the drawback of these perturbative methods is that they require the strong coupling constant to be perturbatively small .",
    "however , at the temperature of 200 mev attained at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) or the higher temperature of 490 mev that is expected to be reached at the linear hadron collider ( lhc ) this condition is not fulfilled .",
    "this motivates the search for alternative methods to calculate these transport coefficients at the relevant temperatures .",
    "one such alternative method is the use of models that possess symmetries of low energy qcd to calculate the transport coefficients of interest . for two flavors of massless",
    "quarks these symmetries are @xmath5 . the proposed model ,",
    "of course , should also be able to account for the spontaneous breaking of the axial symmetries , and the invariance of the ground state under the diagonal subgroup @xmath6 .",
    "corresponding to each broken ( axial ) generator a goldstone boson appears , which are then naturally identified with the neutral and charged pions .",
    "njl model  @xcite which was proposed quite a time ago is one such model .",
    "it gives a realistic description of low energy qcd .",
    "it exhibits a chiral phase transition through which the quarks ( and anti - quarks ) acquire masses as the temperature is lowered below the critical temperature .",
    "even though it was put forth as a theory of nucleons , it was reinterpreted as a theory of quarks , and extended to finite temperature and nonvanishing baryon number chemical potential .",
    "pions and the sigma meson are not propogating degrees of freedom in this model , rather they appear as poles in the pseudoscalar and scalar channels , respectively , of the effective interaction between quarks which is obtained by summing the so - called bubble diagrams .",
    "this is the kind of picture that emerges for qcd in the limit of a large number of colors @xmath7 , so this is the limit in which the njl model is expected to reproduce qcd  @xcite .",
    "this also provides the justification for summing an infinite number of diagrams in the gap equation , which contribute at the same order @xmath8 , to obtain the nonperturbative constituent mass of quarks .",
    "previous calculations of the shear viscosity of the njl model include those that were done diagrammatically  @xcite both at vanishing and finite baryon chemical potentials .",
    "in other calculations , even though the transport equation was used , the assumption of relaxation time approximation was made  @xcite , and the shear viscosity coefficient was calculated in the so - called random phase approximation to leading order in @xmath7 at vanishing chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "there were other calculations at vanishing baryo - chemical potential  @xcite which considered the enlarged symmetry group of @xmath9 , and that also assumed the relaxation time approximation to be valid .",
    "there also exist results for the shear viscosity of the quark gluon plasma at leading order of the strong coupling constant  @xcite , albeit at vanishing baryon number chemical potential , and at leading logarithmic order at finite baryon number chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "these will be compared in section  [ results ] with the results obtained in this paper as well .",
    "jeon had shown  @xcite in the context of @xmath10 theory that the leading order diagrammatic calculation of the viscosity coefficients is equivalent to that done with the boltzmann equation , and later it was shown  @xcite , at least in the case of photo production , that this holds true for finite baryon number chemical potential , too .",
    "it will be assumed in this article that the equivalence between the perturbative calculations of the viscosity coefficients diagrammatically and via kinetic theory holds even when the baryon number chemical potential is nonzero .",
    "the aim of this article is twofold : to calculate the shear viscosity of the njl model at vanishing baryon number chemical potential by solving the boltzmann equation , that is without making the relaxation time approximation , and to systematically generalize it to finite baryon number chemical potentials . in a leading order in @xmath7 calculation , summation of bubble diagrams",
    "leads to pion and sigma meson exchange in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels , respectively . above the chiral phase transition",
    "these appear as resonances , however as the temperature gets closer to the critical temperature the pion resonances turn into bound states that may then go on - shell .",
    "although this is innocuous in s - channel diagrams , it leads to divergences in t- and u - channel ones .",
    "this problem was not present in previous calculations utilizing the relaxation time approximation , because an integrated cross - section was used there . in order to cut off these divergences",
    "one needs to include the width of the pion and sigma mesons below and slightly above the critical temperature .",
    "however , this width does not appear at leading order in @xmath7 .",
    "we choose to avoid these divergences instead by approximating the interaction between quarks with the cross section which is correct to leading order in the coupling constant .    as ensuing analysis of the njl model  @xcite showed , the interaction between quarks and the mesons gets weaker as the temperature approaches the critical temperature from below .",
    "therefore , the neglect of bubble diagrams can , at best , be a reasonable approximation as long as the coupling of quarks to the effective mesonic degrees of freedom @xmath11 is less than one",
    ". this condition will be satisfied if the constituent mass of quarks @xmath12 is less than the zero - temperature pion decay constant @xmath13 mev , that is @xmath14 .",
    "this condition determines the lowest temperature at which we will calculate the shear viscosity coefficient in this article .",
    "dependence of shear viscosity of the njl model on the temperature will be different depending on whether the system is in the chirally symmetric phase or not .",

    "( [ collisionmatrix ] ) , in the collision term of the boltzmann equation .",
    "since we have worked to leading order in @xmath7 and treated @xmath86 in the gap equation , consistency would require that we include in the matrix elements all scattering diagrams to leading order in @xmath7 , that is the so - called bubble diagrams , for a given process as well .",
    "these diagrams , when summed , would then lead to the effective interaction of a pion being exchanged in the pseudo - scalar channel , and a sigma meson being exchanged in the scalar channel .",

    "we are going to compare our results for the zero baryon chemical potential case to previous work in section  [ results ] to see how this approximation affects our results .",
    "it is in principle possible to include the pion pole contribution to the scattering matrix elements in the calculation of the shear viscosity of the njl model , however it should be noted that this is nontrivial due to the divergences it causes in the collision term of the boltzmann equation .",
    "we work in the chiral limit throughout the paper , and in this limit the pion is exactly massless .",
    "therefore , the divergences in the s - channel pion exchange is harmless due to shrinking of the phase space , and a bare pion propogator is sufficient for s - channel exchange .",
    "this parallels s - channel gluon exchange in a quark gluon plasma calculation of shear viscosity where it suffices to use a bare gluon propogator .",
    "however , t- and u - channel pion exchange lead to divergences unless the imaginary part of the pion propogator , that is generated by scatterings of the pion off quarks and anti - quarks in the plasma , is included in those matrix elements .",

    "the critical temperature is below 185 mev for all the higher ratios of the chemical potential to temperature ratio , so the quasi - particles are taken to be massless in those cases .",
    "it should be emphasized that the masses of the quasiparticles in the njl model are nonperturbative masses , and thus they are included in the low temperature phase where they are nonzero .",
    "the treatment of masses in this model should be contrasted with how the thermal masses of species were handled in a leading order in the coupling constant calculation of the shear viscosity of the quark gluon plasma @xmath90 and of scalar theory with quartic self - couplings @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the coupling constants of qcd and @xmath10 theory , respectively . in those calculations ,",
    "all on - shell particles were taken to be exactly massless , and the perturbative effects induced by the thermal masses rightly belonged among the corrections higher order in the coupling constant the leading order result receives .",
    ".charge conjugation invariance forces the matrix elements for scattering of quarks off quarks and of antiquarks off antiquarks to be the same , whereas crossing symmetry relates the matrix elements for scattering of quarks off quarks to scattering of quarks off antiquarks .",
    "the last column gives the absolute square of the matrix elements divided by the square of the coupling constant for these processes .",
    "the square of the matrix elements are summed , but not averaged , over the spins , colors and flavors of the participants . in particular , the matrix elements squred scale wih @xmath94 because an average over the colors has not been taken",
    "of course , the number of colors will be set equal to 3 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ crosssections ]    charge conjugation invariance of the kinetic and interaction terms in the njl model , that is barring the chemical potential term , implies that the matrix elements for the scattering of quarks off quarks and of anti - quarks off anti - quarks are the same .",
    "moreover , the matrix elements for the scattering of quarks off anti - quarks is related to the above by crossing symmetry .",
    "explicit expressions , in terms of the mandelstam variables , for the squares of these matrix elements as they appear in the boltzmann equation , that is summed but not averaged over the spins , flavors , and colors of the participants , are given in the table 1 .",
    "in order to understand the manner ratio of shear viscosity to temperature cubed depends on temperature , we begin by analyzing the dimensionless product @xmath95 , this product is expected to only depend on the ratio of chemical potential to temperature in the chirally symmetric phase , and should therefore be constant for each value of this ratio .",
    "this is clearly the case when the 3-momentum cutoff is taken to infinity in the boltzmann equation as can be seen in figure  [ fig : sheargsquaretemp ] for various values of the chemical potential to temperature ratio .",
    "thus , the ratio of shear viscosity to temperature cubed scales as @xmath96 in the high temperature phase .",
    "the reason the ratio of shear viscosity to the cube of the temperature varies with temperature at all in the massless phase is because the effective coupling constant @xmath97 , which is what is relevant for scattering cross - sections , increases with increasing temperature .",
    "we evaluated the shear viscosity coefficient in the phase of broken chiral symmetry only for the chemical potential to temperature ratios of 0.0 and 0.3 , as the transition temperature in all the other cases falls below 185 mev .",
    "this is the temperature for the vanishing chemical potential case at which the pion - quark coupling constant @xmath11 given by the ratio of the constituent mass of quarks to the zero temperature pion decay constant @xmath98 is of order one @xmath99 , and the \" fine structure constant  is negligible @xmath100 .",
    "our calculation can , at best , be expected to be a good approximation down to these temperatures .",
    "since this temperature is very close to the transition temperatures of 190 and 187 mev for the vanishing chemical potential and for the chemical potential to temperature ratio of 0.3 , respectively , the dimensionless product of the shear viscosity , coupling constant squared and the temperature @xmath95 can be taylor expanded around its value in the chirally symmetric phase @xmath101 with a positive constant @xmath102 .",
    "we found that the values of this dimensionless product were fitted very well with a line in the low temperature phase , the slope of this best fit is the above constant @xmath77 .",
    "ratio of shear viscosity to the cube of the temperature , unlike the dimensionless product , increases as the temperature is lowered in the massive phase .",
    "however , the scaling with temperature changes to @xmath103 .",
    "the change in the scaling of the ratio of shear viscosity to temperature cubed in the two phases is apparent as there is a discontinuity in the slope of the lowest two curves in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : shearovertempcube ] at the transition points of 187 and 190 mev .",
    "these discontinuities persist in the lowest two curves in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ etaovers ] , too , though they are not as prominent .",
    "shear viscosity of the njl model at vanishing chemical potential was calculated previously by zhuang et al .",
    "what we found for the ratio of shear viscosity to temperature cubed in the low temperature phase of broken symmetry agrees with their result exactly .",
    "although they use the same matrix elements in the massive phase as we do , this could not be expected a priori given the relaxation time approximation they made in their calculation .",
    "on the other hand , the dependence of this ratio on the temperature is quite different for the two calculations in the chirally symmetric high temperature phase .",
    "shear viscosity scaled with the third power of the temperature decreases with increasing temperature in both calculations , yet the scalings are different . in this paper , we find this ratio to decrease with the fourth power of the temperature @xmath104 , whereas the figure in the paper of zhuang et al . indicates a less steep decrease with increasing temperature than ours .",
    "thus , our calculation underestimates this ratio by a factor of nearly 3.5 compared to theirs at the temperature of 300 mev .    notwithstanding the fact that the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density was calculated previously",
    ", it should be emphasized that this ratio calculated with the njl model accounts for the almost saturation of the lower bound of this value observed in experiments conducted at rhic much better than perturbative qcd calculations do .",
    "for example , the leading order in the strong coupling constant calculation of arnold et al .",
    "@xcite found the viscosity coefficient to be @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the debye mass .",
    "the value of the ratio of debye mass to temperature for two flavors considered in this paper is approximately ] @xmath107 for the phenomenological value of @xmath108 .",
    "figure 2 in the aforementioned reference gives for the value of this function @xmath109 so that the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density comes out to be @xmath110 which is nearly 3 times the highest value of this ratio obtained in this paper for the vanishing chemical potential case . on the other hand ,",
    "the lowest value of the shear viscosity to entropy density is attained at the upper end of the temperature range , and is @xmath111 which is only 60@xmath112 greater than the conjectured lower bound  @xcite .",
    "the scalings of the ratio of shear viscosity to the cube of the temperature is also different in the two calculations , high temperature perturbation theory predicts this ratio to be independent of temperature , save for the logarithmic running of the coupling constant with temperature , whereas in this article we found this ratio to decrease with the fourth power of the temperature @xmath104 .",
    "finally , the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density increases monotonically as the ratio of chemical potential to temperature is increased from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .    if the temperatures at which we evaluated the shear viscosity coefficient had been much smaller than the 3-momentum cutoff @xmath113 that appears in the gap equation eq.([gapequation ] ) , and which defines the theory , the precise value of the cutoff would have been immaterial .",
    "this is because the equilibrium distribution functions in the collision term of the boltzmann equation decay exponentially for energies much larger than the temperature @xmath114 and particles with such high momenta do not contribute to the integrals .",
    "however , for the temperatures of 185 to 300 mev at which we are interested in calculating the shear viscosity coefficient one has to assess how sensitive one s results are to the value of this cutoff .",
    "this is exactly what the scattered points in figure  [ fig : sheargsquaretemp ] indicate .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , at lower temperatures imposing a 3-momentum cutoff tends to increase the dimensionless product , and thus the viscosity coefficient itself , whereas at higher temperatures it tends to reduce the value of the shear viscosity to almost half the value it has without the 3-momentum cutoff .    in this article we calculated the leading order in the coupling constant shear viscosity coefficient of a plasma of quarks and anti - quarks interacting according to the njl model at finite temperature above and slightly below the chiral phase transition temperature and at nonzero baryon number chemical potential . in the calculation",
    "the ratio of chemical potential to temperature was not greater than one , i.e. @xmath115 .",
    "we did not sum all scattering diagrams to leading order in the number of colors @xmath116 , and instead evaluated the matrix elements for scattering by the tree level scalar and pseudoscalar interaction terms in the lagrangian , that is to leading order in the coupling constant @xmath117 . in order to obtain the shear viscosity coefficient we solved the linearized boltzmann equation .",
    "we found that the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density decreased with increasing temperature , scaling like @xmath118 in the high temperature phase .",
    "the value of this ratio was found to be roughly 1.5 times the conjectured lower bound of @xmath3 at the temperature of 300 mev for the vanishing chemical potential case , and was not in any of the cases considered greater than 13 times this bound .",
    "therefore , shear viscosity over entropy density calculated in this model reproduced the low value observed in experiments far better than perturbative calculations did .",
    "shear viscosity did not change much as the ratio of chemical potential to temperature was varied , however it was a monotonically increasing function of this variable .",
    "the vanishing width of the pion as the critical temperature is approached from above prevented us from using all cross sections for scattering that are correct to order @xmath116 in the boltzmann equation .",
    "as even stable particles acquire a width in a thermal medium , it might be possible to correctly incorporate this width of the pion in the calculation of the shear viscosity by including diagrams of @xmath87 .",

    "<S> we find the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density above and slightly below the chiral transition temperature to vary from 1.5 to 13 times the conjectured lower bound of @xmath3 depending on the chemical potential to temperature ratio . </S>",
    "<S> ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is found to be a monotonically increasing function of the ratio of chemical potential to temperature for temperatures between 185 and 300 mev . </S>"
