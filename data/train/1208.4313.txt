    "the use of applied three - dimensional magnetic fields can have beneficial effects on the performance of otherwise axisymmetric toroidal confinement devices @xcite .",
    "in particular , the application of external 3-d resonant magnetic perturbations ( rmp ) whose resonant surface lies in the edge region of h - mode tokamaks can suppress the appearance of edge localized modes ( elms ) under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "elms repeatedly and violently eject hot plasma from the tokamak edge onto solid materials of the device . in order to safely operate at the desired parameters without prohibitive erosion of first wall materials , future experiments such as iter",
    "will require a reliable method for controlling edge properties to prevent large type - i elms @xcite .",
    "the original motivation for pursuing the rmp method of elm suppression was based on the expectation that resonant magnetic perturbations of sufficient magnitude would produce overlapping magnetic islands that would greatly enhance plasma transport in the edge region and accordingly reduce the drive for elm inducing instabilities associated with edge pressure gradients and currents @xcite .",
    "however , plasma flows in the edge region may be of sufficient magnitude to shield resonant magnetic perturbations from penetration @xcite in which case stochastic transport is no longer viable .",
    "hence , a different mechanism may be required to explain the observations which indicate that the externally applied 3-d perturbations can enhance plasma transport in the pedestal and preclude the triggering of elms .",
    "experiments with applied 3-d magnetic perturbations have now been performed on a number of tokamaks worldwide , yielding varying results .",
    "experiments performed at the diii - d tokamak with @xmath0 perturbations have demonstrated suppression of large type - i elms at various collisionalities and with different plasma shaping . in many cases",
    "the large type - i elms are replaced by higher frequency , lower amplitude edge transport bursts @xcite .",
    "this has also been achieved for example at jet @xcite with @xmath1 and @xmath2 perturbations , at mast with @xmath0 perburations @xcite , and at asdex - u with @xmath2 perburbations @xcite . however , in some diii - d experiments a complete elimination of bursty edge transport events has even been achieved @xcite . in this work",
    "we provide a possible explanation for elm - free operation that does not rely on stochastic magnetic fields to enhance the transport in the edge region of h - mode tokamaks .",
    "we propose a model for the enhanced transport in the edge region that is based on the three - dimensional distortions of the magnetic surfaces adversely affecting microinstabilities . while the effects of 3-d fields on stability discussed here is generic to a broad range of localized modes , we concentrate on the properties of kinetic ballooning modes ( kbms ) in this work , which are primary candidates for explaining edge pedestal transport in h - mode plasmas .",
    "kbm growth rates become very large as the infinite - n ideal ballooning boundary is approached @xcite . as such , ideal mhd ballooning mode calculations are often used as a proxy for the abrupt onset of kbm instabilities and the associated stiff transport response @xcite . in particular , calculations using information from ideal ballooning stability and peeling - ballooning ( p - b ) theory used to predict elm onset have successfully predicted self - consistent pedestal widths and heights @xcite .",
    "gyrokinetic modeling of microinstabilities in the pedestal also supports the hypothesis that kbms limit the pedestal pressure gradient and thus regulate the inward advance of the pedestal @xcite .    in this work",
    ", the effect of the 3-d distortions of the mhd equilibrium on ideal ballooning stability is calculated . for amplitudes of comparable measure to those present in experiments , the 3-d distortions are shown to substantially modify the local shear and reduce the critical pressure gradient for ideal ballooning instability .",
    "this is purely a 3-d mhd equilibrium effect , occuring due to pfirsch - schlter currents near rational surfaces that are driven by 3-d inhomogeneity in the magnetic field spectrum .",
    "this is a resonant effect and would lower the achievable pressure gradient in the vicinity of low order rational surfaces where the 3-d deformation is strongest .",
    "enhanced transport due to the onset of kbm instabilities at lower pressure gradient , due to the 3-d effect , could halt the inward progression of the edge pedestal and achieve elm mitigation by preventing the pedestal height from reaching values where p - b modes are driven unstable .",
    "this explanation is consistent with recent pedestal modeling work where the prevention of elms was explained by the existence of a wall at a low order rational surface which prevents the inward advance of the pedestal @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the global mhd instabilities that are thought to trigger elms , peeling - ballooning modes , may be sensitive to this local shear modulation as well .",
    "the high - n components of these modes are dominated by ballooning structure , and we show in this work that ( local ) infinite - n ballooning modes are strongly affected by the local shear modulation ( though we use the infinite - n ballooning calculations merely as a proxy for the onset of kbm instabilities and the associated transport ) . to understand the effect of resonant pfirsch - schlter currents on the peeling - ballooning instabilities would require global mhd stability calculations using global 3-d mhd equilibria which include the resonant pfirsch - schlter physics .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this work . in particular",
    ", this model attempts to provide an explanation for the diii - d experiments where the increased pedestal transport completely precludes the triggering of any elms or other bursty events .",
    "therefore , we focus on local kbm stability ( with infinite - n mhd ballooning mode stability as a proxy ) and utilize radially local equilibrium , which greatly simplifies the modeling effort and should be adequate for microinstability calculations .    in the following section , details for how 3-d fields alter the mhd equilibrium are described using local 3-d equilibrium theory . in section iii",
    ", the infinite - n ideal mhd ballooning stability boundary is evaluated for a set of equilibria with 3-d flux surface deformations of experimentally relevant magnitude .",

    "this is related to the same physical effect which leads to the singular current problem of 3-d global mhd equilibrium calculations .",
    "a second point is that this 3-d modulation of the local shear has a significant effect on the ideal ballooning stability boundaries .",
    "these calculations suggest that the onset conditions for kbm instability can be significantly lowered near rational surfaces in the presence of 3-d perturbations .",
    "the initial variant of the predictive pedestal model eped ( eped1 ) described the onset of kbm turbulence using the approxmation that the marginal stability boundary was of the shape @xmath126 @xcite , suggesting that pedestal evolution is particularly sensitive to the lower left portion of the stability boundary , which is where it is most strongly perturbed by the 3-d local shear modulation .",
    "gyrokinetic modeling of pedestal evolution has found that the inward advance of the pedestal occurs when unstable kbms at the pedestal top are pushed toward marginal stability by the lowering of the surface averaged magnetic shear associated with growing boostrap currents as the pressure gradient rises @xcite .",
    "given that the dominant effect of the 3-d local shear modulation is to allow instability at much lower surface averaged shear , as seen in figure [ rmp_boundary ] , the 3-d pertubations could halt the inward advance of the pedestal by disrupting this stabilization process at the pedestal top once it reaches a low order rational surface . in this event ,",

    "studies of plasma microinstabilities in the presence of 3-d rmp fields which utilize 2-d mhd equilibria and include the rmp field separately will not capture the pfirsch - schlter physics . proper analysis of this effect requires 3-d mhd equilibrium calculations with a finite pressure gradient at the surface(s ) of interest .",
    "the ideal mhd model exhibits a singular parallel current at rational surfaces which in principle must be resolved using a more detailed physics model .",
    "we have sidestepped this by using radially local equilibrium calculations and merely examining near - resonant effects . however",
    ", a better understanding of the nature of the plasma response to 3-d deformation at rational surfaces is desirable .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a model for enhanced transport in the edge region of h - mode tokamaks in the presence of rmp fields .",
    "small 3-d distortions of the flux surface shape can lead to helical pfirsch - schlter currents which substantially modulate the local magnetic shear , a quantity which plays an important role in stability of localized modes and their associated anomalous transport . even when the resonant components of the radial magnetic perturbation is shielded , this effect is still operative .",
    "the pfirsch - schlter current and local shear are determined by magnetic differential equations which becomes singular near rational values of @xmath4 . at a rational surface",
    "this singular response will be resolved by physical mechanisms beyond the scope of ideal mhd .",
    "however the near - resonant response is quite significant , and therefore 3-d magnetic perturbations with a broad poloidal mode spectrum may be able to halt the inward evolution of the pedestal as it approaches a low order rational surface by adversely affecting kbm turbulence .    future work will use linear and nonlinear gyrokinetic calculation of kbms to test the ideal mhd ballooning prediction",
    ". a better understanding of what physical processes resolve the singular pfirsch - schlter currents present in ideal mhd is desirable to assess the validity of the local 3-d mhd equilibrium calculations as a rational surface is approached .",
    "sensitivity studies of these results with respect to external magnetic perturbation strength and spectrum content also need to be pursued .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that local magnetic shear modulation driven by helical pfirsch - schlter currents provides a possible explanation , which does not rely on stochasticity , for the observed enhanced plasma transport during some elm suppression experiments .",
    "in order to obtain gain more analytic insight into how the 3-d fields alter the ballooning stability properties , analysis of the ballooning equation for a particular 3-d equilibrium can be performed .",
    "we start from an axisymmetric equilibrium with large aspect ratio , low @xmath3 , circular concentric flux surfaces and locally steepened pressure gradient @xcite . to this equilibrium , 3-d fields",
    "are added as described in section ii .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 8) to define the equilibrium in the @xmath127 limit yields asymptotic estimates for various geometric quantities . in particular ,",
    "the normal and geodesic curvatures are given by @xmath128 - \\sum_i m_i \\frac{\\gamma_i}{r_0 r }   \\cos(m_{i}\\theta - n_{i}\\zeta )   , \\ ] ] @xmath129 + \\sum_i m_i \\frac{\\gamma_i}{r_o r }   \\sin(m_{i}\\theta - n_{i}\\zeta )   .\\ ] ] here , the first terms correspond to the usual @xmath130 contributions to the curvature vector , while the last terms correspond to the weak modulations due to the 3-d fields . while the 3-d fields provide very small corrections to the curvature vector , they can produce substantial corrections to the pfirsch - schluter coefficient .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( 18 ) for this equilibrium is given by @xmath131   , \\ ] ] where the first term is the conventional high - aspect ratio prediction for the pfirsch - schluter coefficient and the last term is due to the 3-d fields . as noted , the 3-d fields can produce an appreciable effect when the 3-d field is near pitch resonance with the @xmath4 profile .    with these modifications , the 3-d corrections to the shifted circle equilibrium can be included assuming @xmath132 but @xmath133 .",
    "the ballooning equation for the shifted - circle equilibrium with small 3-d distortions is given by @xmath134 + \\alpha[\\cos\\theta + \\lambda \\sin\\theta ] \\xi   =   - ( 1 + \\lambda^2 ) \\hat{\\omega}^2 \\xi , \\ ] ] where the effect of the 3-d fields enters through the integrated local shear quantity @xmath135 given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 denotes a field line label .",
    "generally , numerical solutions show that the large variation of the local shear produced by the 3-d fields produces localized eigenfunctions along the field line . using this strong ballooning approximation , the ballooning equation can be converted to an equation of the form @xmath138 , where the potential function @xmath139 can be expanded about @xmath140 , @xmath141 . from this calculation ,",
    "the corresponding critical @xmath71 for ballooning instability can be calculated . in the large @xmath71 , @xmath142 limit , this is given approximately by @xmath143 where higher order corrections are suppressed . from this",
    ", we can see that the 3-d fields can produced order unity corrections to ballooning stability boundary when @xmath144 .",
    "when this is the case , the @xmath145 can be substantially modified .",
    "additionally , we note that the 3-d correction is sensitive to field - line label as noted by the @xmath137 dependence . both of these features are also demonstrated by the more detailed numerical study described in the bulk of the paper ."
