    "in 1971 , martinet @xcite showed that every 3-manifold admits a contact structure .",
    "but in the subsequent twenty years , through the work of bennequin @xcite and eliashberg @xcite , it became apparent that not all contact structures are created equal in dimension 3 .",
    "specifically , contact structures fall into one of two classes : tight or overtwisted . in this new light ,",
    "what martinet actually showed was that every 3-manifold admits an overtwisted contact structure . in @xcite eliashberg classified overtwisted contact structures on closed 3-manifolds by proving the weak homotopy equivalence of the space of overtwisted contact structures up to isotopy and the space of 2-plane fields up to homotopy  hence overtwisted contact structures could now be understood via homotopy theory . on the other hand ,",
    "it has become apparent that tight contact structures have surprising and deep connections to the topology of 3-manifolds , not limited to homotopy theory .",
    "for example , rudolph @xcite and lisca and mati @xcite found connections with slice knots and slice genus , kronheimer and mrowka @xcite found connections with seiberg - witten theory , and eliashberg and thurston @xcite found connections with foliation theory .",
    "thus , whether or not every 3-manifold admits a tight contact structure became a central question in 3-dimensional contact topology .    the first candidate for a 3-manifold without a tight contact structure was the poincar homology sphere @xmath0 with reverse orientation .",
    "the difficulty of constructing a holomorphically fillable contact structure on @xmath1 was highlighted in gompf s paper @xcite .",
    "subsequently lisca @xcite , using techniques from seiberg - witten theory , proved that @xmath1 has no symplectically semi - fillable contact structure .    in this paper",
    "we prove the following nonexistence result .",
    "[ thm : main ] there exist no positive tight contact structures on the poincar homology sphere @xmath2 with reverse orientation .",
    "this is the first example of a closed 3-manifold which does not carry a positive tight contact structure .",
    "let @xmath1 be the poincar homology sphere with reverse orientation .",
    "then the connect sum @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is @xmath1 with the opposite orientation , does not carry any tight contact structure , positive or negative .",
    "this follows from theorem [ thm : main ] , since a tight structures on a reducible manifold may be decomposed into tight structures on its summands @xcite",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the basics ideas of contact topology in dimension 3 ( see for example @xcite ) . a thorough understanding of @xcite would be helpful but we include a brief summary of the ideas and terminology",
    ". the reader might also find @xcite useful for various parts of this section .    in this paper the ambient manifold @xmath1 will be an oriented 3-manifold , and",
    "the contact structure @xmath5 will be _ positive _ , _ i.e. _ , given by a 1-form @xmath6 with @xmath7 . throughout this section",
    "we only consider @xmath8 _ tight_. also , when we refer to _ legendrian curves _ we mean closed curves , in contrast to _ legendrian arcs_.",
    "recall an oriented embedded surface @xmath9 in @xmath8 is called if there is a vector field @xmath10 transverse to @xmath9 whose flow preserves @xmath11 perhaps the most important feature of convex surfaces is the _ dividing set_. if @xmath12 is a singular foliation on @xmath9 then a disjoint union of ( properly ) embedded curves @xmath13 is said to @xmath12 if @xmath13 divides @xmath9 into two parts @xmath14 @xmath13 is transverse to @xmath15 and there is a vector field @xmath16 directing @xmath12 and a volume form @xmath17 on @xmath9 such that @xmath18 on @xmath19 and @xmath16 points transversely out of @xmath20 if @xmath6 is a contact 1-form for @xmath5 then the zeros of @xmath21 provide dividing curves for the characteristic foliation @xmath22 it is sometimes useful to keep in mind that the dividing curves are where @xmath10 is tangent to @xmath11 an isotopy @xmath23\\to m$ ] of @xmath9 is called if @xmath24 is transversal to @xmath10 for all @xmath25 an important result concerning convex surfaces we will ( implicitly ) be using through out this paper is :    [ giroux : main ] let @xmath13 be the dividing set for @xmath26 and @xmath12 another singular foliation on @xmath9 divided by @xmath27 then there is an admissible isotopy @xmath28 of @xmath9 such that @xmath29 @xmath30 and the isotopy is fixed on @xmath27    roughly speaking , this says that the dividing set @xmath13 dictates the geometry of @xmath9 , not the precise characteristic foliation",
    ".    we will let @xmath31 denote the number of connected components of @xmath13 .",
    "if there is any ambiguity , we will also write @xmath32 instead of @xmath13 to denote the dividing set of @xmath9 .      let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be compact convex surfaces with legendrian boundary , which intersect transversely along a common boundary legendrian curve @xmath35 . the neighborhood of the common boundary legendrian is locally isomorphic to the neighborhood @xmath36 of @xmath37 with coordinates @xmath38 and contact 1-form @xmath39 , for some @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 , @xmath42 , be an annular collar of the boundary component @xmath35 .",
    "we may choose our local model so that @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( or the same with @xmath45 and @xmath46 switched ) .",
    "assuming the former , if we join @xmath33 and @xmath34 along @xmath47 and round the common edge , the resulting surface is convex , and the dividing curve @xmath48 on @xmath33 will connect to the dividing curve @xmath49 on @xmath34 , where @xmath50 .",
    "we now introduce the main idea on which this work is based .",
    "let @xmath35 be a legendrian arc .",
    "a half - disk @xmath51 is called a @xmath35 if @xmath52 is legendrian and consists of two arcs @xmath53 and @xmath54 such that , if we orient @xmath51 , @xmath55 are both positive ( negative ) elliptic singular points in @xmath56 there is a negative ( positive ) elliptic point along @xmath57 , and the singular points along @xmath54 are all positive ( negative ) and alternate between elliptic and hyperbolic .",
    "see figure  [ bypass ] .",
    "= 1.3 in    we also allow for the degenerate case when @xmath35 is a closed curve and the endpoints of @xmath57 are the same ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath58 ) .",
    "we refer to such a bypass as a .",
    "once an orientation on @xmath51 is fixed , the of the bypass is the sign of the elliptic point on the interior of @xmath59 the reason for the name ` bypass ' is that , instead of traveling along the legendrian arc @xmath35 , we may go around and drive through @xmath60  this has the effect of increasing the twisting of @xmath5 along the legendrian curve .",
    "( here we are using the convention that left twists are negative . )",
    "one can then show :    [ thm : bypass ] assume @xmath1 has a convex boundary @xmath9 and there exists a bypass @xmath51 along the legendrian curve @xmath61 then we can find a neighborhood @xmath62 of @xmath63 with @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is related to @xmath32 as shown in figure  [ bypassmove ] .",
    "= 1.5 in    consider a convex torus @xmath66 . if @xmath5 is tight , then one can show that no dividing curve for @xmath66 bounds a disk .",
    "thus @xmath67 consists of @xmath68 parallel dividing curves with @xmath69 .",
    "assume for now that the dividing curves are all horizontal .",
    "using theorem  [ giroux : main ] we can isotop @xmath66 so that there is one closed curve of singularities in @xmath70 in each region of @xmath71  these are called and are parallel to the dividing curves .",
    "we can further assume all the other leaves of @xmath70 form a 1-parameter family of parallel closed curves transverse to the legendrian divides .",
    "these can have any slope not equal to the slope of the dividing curves .",
    "a convex torus @xmath66 is said to be in _ standard form _",
    "if @xmath70 has this nongeneric form , consisting of legendrian divides and legendrian ruling curves .",
    "suppose @xmath72 and we find a bypass for one of the ruling curves for @xmath66 then we may isotop @xmath66 across the bypass as in theorem  [ thm : bypass ] and reduce the number @xmath73 by one . if @xmath74 we have a configuration change as follows :    let @xmath66 be a convex torus with @xmath75 and in some basis for @xmath66 the slope of the dividing curves is 0 .",
    "if we find a bypass for a ruling curve of slope between @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 then after pushing @xmath66 across the bypass the new torus has two dividing curves of slope @xmath79      let @xmath80 be a legendrian curve in @xmath81 we can always find a neighborhood @xmath62 of @xmath80 whose boundary is a convex torus with two dividing curves .",
    "the linking of a dividing curve on @xmath82 with @xmath80 is the thurston - bennequin invariant of @xmath83 we call the slope of these dividing curves the _ boundary slope _ of @xmath84 if @xmath80 is not null - homologous , then the framing induced on @xmath80 relative to some pre - assigned trivialization of the normal bundle of @xmath80 will be called the of @xmath83 in contrast to transverse curves , neighborhoods of legendrian curves have a quantifiable thickness  no matter how small a ( nice ) neighborhood of a legendrian curve one takes , the boundary slope of the neighborhood is fixed . if @xmath62 is the neighborhood of a legendrian curve with twisting number @xmath85 ( relative to a framing that is already fixed ) , then the slopes of the dividing curves on @xmath86 are @xmath87 . on the other hand , any tight contact structure on the solid torus @xmath88 with boundary slope",
    "@xmath87 is contact isotopic to a neighborhood of a legendrian curve with twisting number @xmath89 see @xcite .",
    "it is easy to decrease the twisting number inside @xmath62 by adding ` zigzags ' ( see below for an explanation of terminology ) .",
    "hence , increasing the twisting number is one way of thickening @xmath62 .",
    "we now show how to use bypasses to increase the twisting number of @xmath83    let @xmath80 be a legendrian curve in @xmath1 with a fixed framing .",
    "let @xmath62 be a standard neighborhood of @xmath80 and @xmath73 the twisting number of @xmath83 if there exists a bypass attached to a legendrian ruling curve of @xmath82 of slope @xmath90 and @xmath91 then there exists a legendrian curve with larger twisting number isotopic to @xmath83    this lemma is a very useful formulation of the observation that if one has a bypass for a legendrian knot then one can increase its twisting number .",
    "now that we see bypasses are useful let us consider how to find them .",
    "let @xmath9 be a convex surface with legendrian boundary @xmath92 if the thurston - bennequin invariant of @xmath35 ( or let us say twisting number with respect to @xmath9 ) is negative then we can arrange that all the singularities of @xmath26 along @xmath35 are ( half)-elliptic . moreover we can assume the singular foliation @xmath26 is morse - smale . if @xmath73 is the twisting number of @xmath35 , then @xmath32 intersects @xmath35 at @xmath68 points . in this situation we can use the flow of @xmath16 ( the vector field directing @xmath26 in the definition of the dividing set ) to flow any dividing curve to a legendrian arc on @xmath9 , all of whose singularities are of the same sign .",
    "now , starting with a dividing curve @xmath93 with endpoints along @xmath35 isotopic to the boundary of @xmath9 , we push @xmath93 ` back into @xmath9 along @xmath16 ' and eventually arrive at a legendrian arc which cuts a bypass for @xmath35 off of @xmath94 thus to find bypasses we need only look for these @xmath95-compressible dividing curves .",
    "we now explore the neighborhood of a legendrian knot in more detail . to this end",
    "let @xmath62 be a standard neighborhood of a legendrian knot @xmath80 with a fixed framing so that @xmath96 and @xmath80 has twisting number @xmath97 in this framing .",
    "recall this means that @xmath82 is convex with two dividing curves ( and two legendrian divides ) of slope @xmath98 inside of @xmath62 we can isotop @xmath80 ( but not legendrian isotop ) to @xmath99 so as to decrease the twisting number by one .",
    "there are actually two different ways to do this .",
    "if @xmath80 were a knot in @xmath100 with the standard tight contact structure then this process corresponds to stabilizing the knot ( reducing the thurston - bennequin invariant ) by adding zigzags , and one can do this while increasing or decreasing the rotation number by one .    to see how to detect this difference in @xmath62",
    "we do the following : first , fix an orientation on @xmath62 and orient @xmath80 so that @xmath80 and @xmath101 intersect positively .",
    "let @xmath102 be a standard neighborhood of @xmath99 .",
    "then consider the layer @xmath103=n\\backslash n'$ ] , where we set @xmath104 and @xmath105 we assume the legendrian ruling curves are vertical so that @xmath106 $ ] is an annulus with legendrian boundary .",
    "note that @xmath107 intersects the dividing curves on @xmath108 @xmath109 times and @xmath110 intersects the dividing curves on @xmath111 @xmath68 times .",
    "so there will be a bypass ( in fact just one bypass ) on @xmath112 for @xmath113 if @xmath112 is oriented so that the orientation on @xmath107 agrees with the one chosen above on @xmath80 , then the sign of the bypass is what distinguishes the two possible @xmath99 s .",
    "if @xmath93 is a curve on @xmath107 whose slope is not @xmath114 or @xmath115 then we can make the legendrian ruling curves on @xmath116 parallel to @xmath117 later it will be useful to know what the dividing curves on @xmath118 $ ] will look like",
    ". the relative euler class in the next paragraph can be useful for this purpose .",
    "let @xmath5 be any tight structure on a toric annulus @xmath119 $ ] ( not necessarily the same one as in the above paragraphs ) .",
    "assume the boundary is convex and in standard form .",
    "let @xmath120 be a section of @xmath121 which is transverse to and twists ( with @xmath5 ) along the legendrian ruling curves .",

    "now suppose @xmath67 consists of two parallel arcs , since otherwise we are done .",
    "then @xmath291 consists of two arcs and @xmath292 consists of the image of these two arcs under the monodromy map for the bundle .",

    "thus we have a bypass @xmath51 for the dividing curves on @xmath286    assume first that the intersection number is exactly two",
    ". then the annulus @xmath296 may be split into two annuli , one of which , call it @xmath297 intersects @xmath298 and contains @xmath51 , which is of degenerate type .",
    "the boundary of a small neighborhood of @xmath299 in @xmath300 is an annulus @xmath301 and has dividing curves as shown in figure  [ fig : annulus ] .",
    "the boundary of @xmath301 sits on @xmath286 if we cut out the annulus in @xmath298 that cobounds a solid torus with @xmath302 glue in @xmath301 , and smooth corners , then the dividing curves on the new @xmath298 are shown in figure  [ fig : annulus ] .",
    "if the intersection number is greater than two , then simply attach the bypass @xmath51 onto @xmath298  either the new @xmath298 has a bypass , in which case we are done , or we can take a new @xmath296 which has fewer ( but @xmath304 intersections ) .",
    "we continue until the intersection number becomes two .",
    "[ lem : twist ] we may increase @xmath245 to @xmath241 while keeping @xmath202 and @xmath305 moreover , @xmath234 may be further thickened to @xmath306 so that @xmath307 has dividing curves of slope @xmath277    since we have a bypass on @xmath267 we may apply the twist number lemma to increase the twist number of @xmath247 to @xmath308 so we have two vertical dividing curves on @xmath270 and on @xmath309 they have slope 0 . now repeating the argument in lemma  [ increase ]",
    "we see that we can arrange @xmath202 and @xmath305 note the dividing curves on @xmath310 and @xmath311 have slope @xmath228 and 0 , respectively . thus taking a vertical annulus between @xmath312 and @xmath209",
    ", we find a vertical bypass along @xmath313 with this bypass we can thicken @xmath234 to @xmath306 whose dividing curves have slope @xmath277        note if we had another bypass along @xmath267 we could increase @xmath245 to 1 and from here we could then find an overtwisted disk ( see below ) .",
    "however , we know of no direct way to prove this bypass exists",
    ". therefore we use the following strategy , which can be called as ` thinning before thickening ' .",
    "notice we have thickened @xmath235 so that @xmath246 ; we will now backtrack by having @xmath235 relinquish some of its thickness ( we peel off a toric annulus from @xmath235 and reattach to @xmath186 and @xmath234 ) , and then thicken again to obtain a contradiction .",
    "let @xmath317 be the meridional disk to @xmath167 for @xmath318 if we arrange that the legendrian rulings on @xmath200 are horizontal and the @xmath317 are convex , then @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "the dividing sets divide @xmath257 into two regions , one positive and one negative , and @xmath258 into three regions  without loss of generality we can assume that , two regions are positive and one is negative .",
    "note that the signs of these regions depend on an orientation on the disks .",
    "pick an orientation for the fibers of the seifert fibration , and the disks will be oriented so that their intersection with a fiber is positive .",
    "note we can write @xmath321 , where @xmath322 is a solid torus with convex boundary and dividing curves of slope @xmath239 ( on @xmath323 ) , @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath324 , and @xmath325 is convex with vertical dividing curves .",
    "we do this by stabilizing ( reducing the twist number ) @xmath247 with @xmath315 in @xmath326 in @xmath150 we can find a @xmath327 , say @xmath328 with dividing curves of slope @xmath219 ( which correspond to vertical dividing curves from the point of view of @xmath329 ) . by performing the correct stabilization we can arrange that on a convex annulus in @xmath330 $ ] of slope @xmath331 with legendrian boundary on @xmath332 and @xmath333 there is a negative bypass along the boundary component on @xmath334 we can use this bypass to thicken @xmath167 , @xmath42 , to @xmath204 so that @xmath335 have vertical slopes . using the relative euler class",
    "we can easily see that each meridional disk @xmath336 in @xmath248 has an extra positive region . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath337 is the relative euler class on @xmath338 ( as defined in section  [ section : convexity ] ) and @xmath339 and @xmath340 are the horizontal and vertical curves on @xmath341 then one may easily compute that @xmath342)= 1 $ ] and @xmath343)=0.$ ] thus @xmath344)=1 $ ] where @xmath93 is the boundary of the meridional disk in @xmath345 from this and equation  [ eqn : formula ] , we can conclude that the dividing curves are as in figure  [ anndivides ]  ( a ) ,    and hence a convex meridional disk in @xmath251 will have one negative and two positive regions in the complement of the dividing curves .",
    "similarly , a convex meridional disk in @xmath250 will have one negative and three positive regions since a relative euler class argument will show its intersection with @xmath346 is shown in figure  [ anndivides ]  ( b )      we would now like to piece these meridional disks together to form a punctured torus fiber for @xmath348 , but to do this we first need to understand the complement of the singular fibers . recall all the boundary slopes of @xmath349 are infinite .",
    "take @xmath350 , which we assume is convex with legendrian boundary .",
    "all the boundary components of @xmath9 have exactly two half - elliptic points .",
    "we argue that if there is a @xmath95-compressible dividing arc ( as in ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) ) on @xmath9 , then @xmath1 is overtwisted .",
    "the @xmath95-compressible dividing arc implies the existence of a bypass ( of degenerate type ) along some @xmath351 .",
    "hence , there exists a layer @xmath352 with one boundary component @xmath351 and boundary slopes @xmath241 and @xmath157 .",
    "however , since there are vertical legendrian curves with twisting number 0 outside of @xmath353 , we obtain another layer @xmath354 , this time with boundary slopes @xmath157 and @xmath241 .",
    "therefore , @xmath355 has too much radial twisting , and is overtwisted .",
    "the only possible configuration without a @xmath95-compressible dividing arc is ( a ) .",
    "we cut @xmath347 along @xmath9 , round the edges , and examine the dividing curves on the boundary of the resulting genus 2 handlebody .",
    "we then cut along the meridional disks of the handlebody , which we may assume have legendrian boundary , and eventually obtain a 3-ball .",
    "since each meridional disk of the handlebody intersects the dividing set only twice , the configuration of dividing curves on the meridional disks is unique .",
    "therefore the initial configuration of dividing curves on @xmath9 uniquely determines the tight structure on @xmath347 .",
    "the lemma implies that the tight structure on @xmath347 is a translation - invariant tight structure on @xmath164 with infinite boundary slopes , with the standard neighborhood of a vertical legendrian curve with zero twisting removed .",
    "we view this @xmath164 ( minus @xmath88 ) as the region between @xmath359 and @xmath360 ( minus @xmath358 ) .",
    "we may think of the @xmath361-factor as being quite small , and then isotop one of the legendrian divides on @xmath359 to one of the legendrian divides on @xmath360 and finally identify small neighborhoods ( in the tori ) of these divides .",
    "we may then isotop @xmath362 , @xmath42 , away from these neighborhoods so that the meridional disk @xmath363 in @xmath204 has legendrian boundary .",
    "forming the fiber @xmath66 in the fibration of @xmath364 from three copies of @xmath257 and two copies of @xmath258 , we can arrange that @xmath267 is legendrian and the dividing curves on @xmath66 are as in figure  [ goodfiber ] .",
    "thus there are six bypasses for @xmath303 we can use these to increase the twisting number of @xmath267 to 0 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath267 will be a legendrian divide on some thickening of @xmath270 ) which corresponds to an increase of @xmath245 to 1 .",
    "thus the slope of the dividing curves on @xmath365 is @xmath366 .",
    "now repeat the argument in lemma  [ increase ]  take a vertical annulus from @xmath367 to @xmath368 , and start with @xmath369 small . since the denominator of @xmath366 is never equal to @xmath211",
    ", we eventually arrive at @xmath305 this implies the existence of a vertical bypass for @xmath368 , with which we can increase the slope of the dividing curves on @xmath365 to @xmath370 .",
    "thus the legendrian divide on our thickened solid torus bounds a meridional disk in @xmath235 , so we have found an overtwisted disk .",
    "this completes the proof of the main theorem ."
