    "searching for transits is one of the most productive methods of detecting planets outside of our solar system .",
    "transiting exoplanets ( teps ) around bright stars are of particular interest as they are the best targets for follow - up observations to investigate their detailed orbital geometries , atmospheric properties and chemical compositions .",
    "recent years have seen a rapid increase in the discovery rate of transit exoplanets ( teps ) .",
    "the _ kepler mission _",
    "@xcite has identified @xmath134000 planetary candidates in its four years of operations @xcite .",
    "approximately a hundred of the _ kepler _ planets have their mass measured using stellar radial velocities ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and many others ) , or numerically modeled transit timing variations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and many others ) . the majority of _ kepler _ planet candidate hosting stars are , however , often faint , complicating both the accurate planetary mass measurements and also the study of their physical nature .",
    "for example , to date , the majority of the planets with precise mass measurements are still from the ground - based wide field transiting planet surveys such as superwasp @xcite , hatnet / hatsouth @xcite , kelt @xcite , and others .",
    "traditionally , confirmation of planets from ground - based transit surveys relies on high precision photometric follow - up from one or two meter class ground - based telescopes .",
    "these follow - up observations ensure the robustness of the detections , help to rule out false positives due to binaries , and further constrain the planet parameters",
    ". however , due to the constraints of ground - based observations , it s usually difficult to observe the full orbital phase of a transiting planet candidate , including primary and secondary transits .",
    "the presence or lack of deep secondary eclipses , or out - of - transit variations is often important information for ruling out blended stellar eclipsing binary scenarios .",
    "the quality of ground - based photometry may also be reduced due to poor weather conditions , site and target restrictions , and airmass trends . due to the loss of two reaction wheels during the main mission , the _ kepler _ spacecraft entered a new observation phase .",
    "this successor mission of _ kepler _ , called the _ k2 _",
    "mission @xcite , covers a much larger area of sky with a step and stare strategy .",
    "the guest observation mode of this mission provides a great tool to follow up the ground - based planetary candidates , and enables a new method of discovering teps through a synergy between ground- and space - based transit surveys .",
    "_ k2 _ observations allow us to obtain high precision light curves  of candidates over a continuous and relatively long time - baseline covering many transit events due to a planet .",
    "once the planet is confirmed , having high precision light curves  from space observations will also enable further characterization of the planet .",
    "confirmed planets from the ground have been recognized as valuable targets to be followed up by _ k2 _ @xcite .",
    "the planets discovered by ground based tep surveys , and also observed by the original _ kepler mission _ , such as tres-2b @xcite , hat - p-7b @xcite , and hat - p-11b @xcite , are among the best studied planets . with the high precision _ kepler _ light curves , many effects due to the planets can be measured , such as the orbital phase variation and occultation of the planet @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit obliquity angle of hat - p-11b has also been constrained using the starspot crossing events observed in the _ kepler _ light curves @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling of the transit shape using the short cadence photometry of _ kepler _ can also be used to determine the probable gravity darkening effect , and constrain the oblateness of the planet @xcite .",
    "following up candidates from ground - based transit surveys is an efficient way to utilize the _ k2 _ observational resources . due to constraints from the new mode of operation , the number of targets observed by _ k2 _ per field is much smaller than for the original _ kepler _ field .",
    "the high priority planetary candidates from ground - based surveys are pre - selected targets which are known to show transits , and which have already been vetted against various false positive scenarios . selecting these candidates to fall on _ k2 _  postage stamps \"",
    "is one way to increase the confirmed planet yield from this mission .    in this paper",
    "we present the discovery ( see figure [ fig : flowchart ] ) of a transiting planet , hat - p-56b , in the _",
    "k2 _ campaign 0 field .",
    "this planet was originally identified as a hatnet @xcite planetary candidate , was followed up by the tres spectrograph on the flwo  1.5 m telescope , and also by the keplercam imager on the flwo  1.2 m telescope",
    ". encouraged by these initial results , all pointing toward a _",
    "bona fide _ planet orbiting the host star hat - p-56 , the target was proposed for _",
    "_ observations . indeed , the very high quality photometric observations of _",
    "k2 _ confirmed the transit , and also eliminated most of the possible blend scenarios .",
    "we then continued following - up hat - p-56  with the tres spectrograph , so as to determine the mass of the orbiting body .    in  [ sec :",
    "obs ] we summarize the detection of the photometric transit signal in the hatnet light curve , follow - up photometry from the ground and from",

    "we discuss these observations below .",
    "all of our discovery data and follow - up data are publicly available in electronic format as machine readable tables , and also via hatnet website .",
    "the star hat - p-56 was observed by the hatnet wide - field photometric instruments @xcite between the nights of ut 2011 october 14 and ut 2012 may 3 .",
    "a total of 6509 observations of a @xmath15 field centered at @xmath16 , @xmath17 were made with the hat-6 telescope in arizona , and 4194 observations of this same field were made with the hat-9 telescope in hawaii ( the count is after filtering some @xmath18 outlier measurements ) .",
    "we used a sloan  @xmath19 filter and an exposure time of @xmath20s .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we reduced the images to trend - filtered light curves for the @xmath13 124,000 stars in the field with @xmath21mag , achieving a point - to - point r.m.s .",
    "precision of 3.5mmag for the brightest non - saturated stars with @xmath22mag ( for hat - p-56 the r.m.s .  of the residuals from our best - fit transit model is 6.7mmag ) .",
    "we searched these light curves for periodic transit signals using the box least squares algorithm ( bls ; * ? ? ?",
    "a total of 29 candidate transiting planets were identified from these light curves , including hat - p-56 , whose phase - folded hatnet light curve we show in figure  [ fig : hatnet ] .",

    "six of the candidates remain active .",
    "initial photometric follow - up observations of hat - p-56 were carried out with keplercam on the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.2 m telescope .",
    "we observed a single transit ingress on the night of ut 2013 march 25 using an @xmath23-band filter and an exposure time of @xmath24s .",
    "the images were reduced to a light curve following @xcite , including external parameter decorrelation performed simultaneously with the transit fit to remove systematic trends ; this trend - corrected light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the r.m.s .  of the residuals from our best - fit model is 2.2mmag for these data .",

    "ut 2014 november 25 using the tillinghast reflector echelle spectrograph ( tres ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at flwo .",
    "we extracted spectra from the images and measured initial rvs , bisector spans ( bss ) and stellar atmospheric parameters following @xcite .",
    "the first three tres observations made between ut 2012 october 31 and ut 2012 november 7 using a short exposure time of 360s resulted in a s / n per resolution element of 3845 , and were used for reconnaissance purposes . based on these three reconnaissance spectra",
    "we found that hat - p-56 is an f dwarf star with a fairly rapid projected rotation velocity of @xmath25@xmath26 , and no evidence for additional stellar components in the spectrum .",
    "the three rv measurements were consistent with no variation above 600@xmath27  ( 3@xmath28 upper limit ) . a single apo  3.5m / arces spectrum of hat - p-56 was also obtained for reconnaissance on ut 2012 november 7 .",
    "a 160s exposure time was used to achieve a s / n per resolution element of 28.6 .",
    "we reduced the observation to a wavelength - calibrated spectrum with the iraf echelle package and used the stellar parameter classification program ( spc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to measure the atmospheric parameters and radial velocity from the spectrum .",
    "this spectrum was also found to be single - lined , had an rv consistent with the tres measurements , and also indicated that the target was a f dwarf with @xmath29@xmath26 .",
    "following the _ k2 _ observations ( section  [ sec : kepphfu ] ) , which showed clean transits with no evidence of secondary eclipses or strong out - of - transit variability in phase with the transits , we resumed spectroscopic monitoring with tres on the flwo  1.5 m telescope , now with the aim of measuring the mass of the planet by detecting the orbital motion of the host star . a total of 18 high s / n ( ranging from 50113 ) observations were collected between ut 2014 october 2 and ut 2014 november 15 .",
    "we measured stellar atmospheric parameters from these spectra using spc , and carried out a multi - order velocity analysis following @xcite to measure the rvs relative to one of the observed spectra and spectral line bisector spans ( bss ) .",
    "table  [ tab : rvs ] provides the measurements extracted from these spectra , where we exclude the reconnaissance spectra that were deemed to be of too low s / n to be used for our final characterization of the orbit and the stellar atmospheric properties .",

    "it has been empirically demonstrated by various authors that more massive planets are harder to inflate .",

    "taken at face value , it is the most inflated hot jupiter with a mass between 1.5@xmath1@xmath4074@xmath1 .",
    "we show the position of hat - p-56b relative to the fundamental plane fitted by @xcite in figure [ fig : rplane ] , where it can be seen that hat - p-56b is the farthest away from the fundamental plane when compared to the other massive planets ( green points in the figure ) .",
    "the fundamental plane of irradiated hot jupiters ( m@xmath408150@xmath409 , or 0.47@xmath1 ) , is expressed as the following @xcite : @xmath410 the unusually large radius of hat - p-56b , given its mass , makes it an important data point in the hot jupiter population .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that the radius of hat - p-56b may have a large uncertainty due to the large impact parameter ( @xmath411 ) indicating a nearly grazing transit .",
    "the grazing transit geometry makes the transit depth highly dependent on the limb darkening parameters of the star .",
    "the radius uncertainties are largely reduced thanks to the high precision _",
    "k2 _ light curve .",
    "another way to better constrain the radius of the planet would be to observe transits in the near infrared where limb darkening is negligible .",
    "the only other planets known to be on close - to grazing orbits are tres-2b , hat - p-27b , wasp-34b , wasp-67b , and kepler-447b @xcite .",
    "while the grazing configuration increases the uncertainty of the planetary radius measurement , as @xcite pointed out , such a near grazing transit has the advantage of its depth and duration being more sensitive to the presence of other planetary companions on inclined orbits .",
    "this makes hat - p-56b a promising target among the hot jupiters for detecting transit timing and duration variations .",
    "given the brightness of the host star ( @xmath412 ) , hat - p-56 is a system of particular interest for measuring the spin - orbit obliquity angle .",
    "the estimated rm effect amplitude @xmath413 is @xmath13 140@xmath27  following equation 5 of @xcite .",
    "hat - p-56 is a relatively fast rotating f star with effective temperature ( k ) slightly above the @xcite division for tidal alignment of hot jupiters .",
    "measurement of the spin - orbit obliquity will contribute an important data point to the obliquity distribution statistics .",
    "the rotation of hat - p-56 is similar to corot-11 , and rapid enough that the distortion in the spectral line profiles during transit may be resolved , enabling transit doppler tomography of the system @xcite .",
    "similar to corot-11 , the rotation period of hat - p-56 is faster than the orbit period of hat - p-56b , which is unusual @xcite .",
