    "spiral galaxies have long been known to show apparent increases in the mass - to - light ratio ( ) in their outer parts , which was one of the prime factors in discovering the ubiquity of dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "current studies of spiral galaxy rotation curves largely focus on the observed radial distribution of the dark matter vis -  - vis the predictions of the current cosmological paradigm , cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ( @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath0cdm simulations of galaxy halo formation predict a steep cusp of dark matter in the halo centres ( @xcite : nfw hereafter ; @xcite ) , while many observations of late - type galaxies indicate relatively low central concentrations of dark matter ( see @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "it remains to be seen if this discrepancy can be traced to observational problems , to oversimplified predictions of the halo properties ( especially with respect to the inclusion of baryonic effects ) , or to a fundamental failure of the @xmath0cdm paradigm .",
    "early - type galaxies ( ellipticals and lenticulars ) are as numerous as late - types , and it is important to see how their dark matter distributions compare to those of spirals and to theoretical predictions . historically , the lack of easily interpretable mass tracers like the cold gas in spirals has made it very difficult to map the mass distribution in early - types at large distances from their centres .",
    "observations of stellar kinematics from integrated - light spectra are mostly confined within @xmath3 ( where the effective radius @xmath4 encloses half the projected light ) , which is generally insufficient for establishing the presence of a dark matter halo @xcite  much less for determining its detailed properties .",
    "attempts to constrain the dark matter content in this way have produced inconsistent results @xcite , demonstrating the difficulties inherent in studying the stellar - dominated regions .",
    "tracers at larger radius in early - type galaxies are needed , and recent advances in instrumentation have dramatically improved the feasibility of measuring halo masses using planetary nebulae ( pne ; @xcite ) , globular clusters ( gcs ; @xcite ) , gaseous x - ray emission @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite , and extended hi disks @xcite .",
    "such studies have so far ascertained the presence of both massive @xcite and weak @xcite dark haloes .",
    "various attempts have been made using halo tracers to derive generic constraints on dark matter in ellipticals @xcite , but none of these has used a large , well - defined sample of ellipticals covering a broad range of luminosities . with ongoing observational projects aimed to the study of mass distribution around early - type galaxies using stellar kinematics ( sauron : @xcite ; pn.s project : @xcite ) , strong gravitational lensing ( class : @xcite ; and lsd : @xcite ) and x - rays @xcite , we expect to have , in the near future , a much better observational picture of the halo mass distributions in a large representative sample of early - type galaxies .    to prepare for this observational onslaught , in this paper we want to provide a suite of predictions from the @xmath0cdm theory for halo mass distributions . to gain qualitative insight , we begin with the most basic characterisation of a dark matter halo around a luminous galaxy : the  radial gradient . in conjunction with deriving predictions for this gradient , we illustrate the kind of analysis possible with future extensive data sets by comparing the currently available observational results with the model expectations .",
    "this approach may be contrasted with the detailed analysis of individual galaxies , where one attempts to decompose the mass distributions into their baryonic and non - baryonic components and then compare these to @xmath0cdm predictions .",
    "here we are more simply looking at a broad property of the mass profiles which can be statistically analysed .",
    "note that even with detailed analyses , it may never be possible in individual galaxies to unravel all the geometrical and dynamical degeneracies , necessitating a statistical approach such as in this paper in order to interpret the results .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we introduce the  gradient as a basic quantity for describing the relative distributions of luminous and dark mass ; in section 3 we present predictions from @xmath0cdm for , including its dependence on various galaxy properties ; in section 4 we assemble observational results on  for a sample of galaxies from the literature , and we test for correlations with other observed properties ; in section 5 we compare the observed and predicted trends in , and examine the implications for galaxy formation .",
    "we draw conclusions in section 6 .",
    "aiming for the simplest characterisation of the dark matter content of a galaxy , we could consider the total  at some large radius , such as the benchmark quantity @xmath5 ( @xmath6-band @xmath7 within 5  @xmath4 ) introduced by @xcite .",
    "this would allow for constructions similar to the tully - fisher relations in spiral galaxies , but in comparing different galaxies , a quantity such as @xmath5 is complicated by differences in the stellar luminosities ( i.e. , in the stellar @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "instead , we consider the increase in the  with radius relative to its value in the galaxy centre ( where it is presumably dominated by @xmath8 ) .",
    "this  gradient gives us a clearer idea of how much extra mass resides in the halo , and it is computed below .    the  gradient is a continuously varying quantity with the ( three - dimensional ) radius , but its average value between an inner and an outer radius ( @xmath9 ) is given by : @xmath10 , \\label{grad0}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the luminous ( stellar ) and the dark masses enclosed within a certain radius .",
    "this is the absolute value of the gradient , but to normalise galaxies of different mass and size to similar scales , we compute @xmath13   \\equiv \\dml . \\label{grad}\\ ] ]    thus  is approximately equivalent to the logarithmic gradient of the .",
    "the predicted value for  is the middle expression of eq .",
    "[ grad ] ( also referred to as  hereafter ) , and is uniquely determined once the mass distributions and measurement radii are adopted ( see section  [ mod ] ) .",
    "the empirical value is the left expression ( , hereafter ) ; in addition to any dynamical modelling uncertainties in @xmath14 , @xmath8 is a source of systematic uncertainty ( discussed later ) .",
    "although  will in principle depend on the location of its measurements ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , the ratio @xmath17 can , to a first approximation , be assumed to vary linearly with the radius ( i.e. , not to have strong local gradients ) , such that  is fairly independent of the measurement radius ( we check this for a theoretical model in sections  [ frac ] and  [ pred ] ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to uniformly compare observational results where the values of @xmath18 are rather heterogeneous .",
    "note also that  is independent of the filter bandpass used for the  estimates .",
    "we build spherical representations of early - type galaxy mass profiles , using a constant-@xmath7 model for the stellar distribution ( section  [ lum ] ) plus a @xmath0cdm model of the dark halo ( section  [ cdm ] ) .",
    "we combine these components in section  [ frac ] .",
    "we do not include a diffuse gas component , since we expect its mass inside @xmath195@xmath4 to be a small fraction of the stellar mass ( we discuss the effect of this assumption in section  [ pred ] ) .",
    "we derive the predictions for various model parameters in section  [ pred ] .",
    "the @xcite profile is known to be a fairly accurate representation of the stellar mass distribution in early - type galaxies ; in projection , it approximates well the de vaucouleurs @xmath20 law @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath8 to be radially constant , the stellar mass density distribution is @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the cumulative mass profile is @xmath23 thus we have a family of density distributions characterised by two parameters : the total luminous mass , @xmath24 , and the effective radius @xmath4 .",

    "[ remleq ] is an important source of uncertainty which we will address in more detail in later sections . in this section",
    "we start drawing predictions for generic early - type galaxies in @xmath0cdm . for this reason",
    "we assume the results from @xcite based on a large statistical sample ( about 140000 galaxies ) as a reasonable representation of the size - mass scaling properties of early - types .",
    "+ @xcite found for their sdss sample of early - type galaxies that @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 for @xmath30 ) , consistent also with the results of @xcite .",
    "other studies of large samples of early - type galaxies have found mean relations between total luminosity and effective radius of @xmath31 , with @xmath32  0.540.63 @xcite , i.e. a slope very similar to the @xcite results under the assumption that @xmath8 is constant with @xmath24 ( and @xmath33 ) . in this case",
    "we could take @xmath34 as an average value .",
    "if this assumption is not true , as suggested by fp studies , then a relation @xmath35 implies @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the exponent @xmath38 depends on the passband and has been found to lie in the range @xmath39  0.20.6 @xcite ; assuming @xmath40 and an intermediate value of @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath42 .",
    "higher values are found using the @xmath43 relation @xcite and the assumption of homology ( @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the effective surface brightness in magnitudes and luminosities , respectively ) .",
    "the kormendy relation @xmath47 implies @xmath48 and with a bit of algebra , @xmath49 , giving @xmath50  0.91.2 for @xmath51  00.3 .",
    "+ we thus adopt @xmath27 as a characteristic value in equation 5 , with @xmath42@xmath52 representing the plausible range .",
    "later in the paper , when comparing model predictions with observations , we will check that this size - mass relation is consistent with our galaxy sample ( section 4.2 ) .",

    ". however , it seems that even the qualitative effects on the mass profiles are not yet known with any certainty , so we are simply taking the nfw profiles as the first approximation to the predictions of @xmath0cdm .",
    "some possible implications of baryonic effects are discussed in section  [ imp ] .      from the previous sections , we see that early - type galaxy mass distributions in the @xmath0cdm framework can be approximated fairly well as a family of two parameters ( for instance , @xmath61 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "we would further like to parametrise the stellar - to - dark mass ratio @xmath81 .",
    "although dark matter could be stripped from the halo , and baryons could be lost or gained through inflows and outflows , for want of more detailed knowledge we assume that the baryon fraction in the galaxy halo is the same as the universal value : @xmath82 .",

    "@xcite claim at least half of the baryonic mass of ddo 170 in the form of gas , which implies @xmath351 assuming baryon conservation .",
    "all these @xmath1 estimates are consistent with what we obtain by comparing the  from their  estimates with our models ( in spite of our model simplification of not including gas ) .",
    "+ we can then conclude that , based on  gradients , there is evidence of low star formation efficiencies in the very low mass regime .",
    "this seems in agreement with other studies @xcite claiming a continuous decreasing star forming efficiency with decreasing masses at these mass scales .",
    "we have introduced a method for measuring  gradients in early - type ( elliptical and lenticular ) galaxies , quantified by .",
    "if the same technique is used for all  measurements in a galaxy , then  is independent of bandpass definitions and distance uncertainties .",
    "we have built typical galaxy models in the @xmath0cdm framework using nfw profiles for the dark matter distribution .",
    "assuming baryon conservation across the virial radius , these galaxies are parametrised by their total stellar mass @xmath24 and their net star formation efficiency @xmath1 ; we have then made predictions for  ( between 0.5  @xmath4 and 4  @xmath4 ) as a function of @xmath352 .",
    "as a consequence of the relative spatial scaling relations of the luminous and dark matter , we have found that brighter galaxies should typically show higher values of  than fainter ones , _ appearing _ more dark - matter dominated even though the overall dark - to - luminous mass fraction @xmath103 is a constant .",
    "these predictions are valid for a mean set of galaxies only , and should not be used to draw direct conclusions about individual galaxies , whose properties are subject to considerable scatter .",
    "we have next assembled a set of  measurements ( using stellar , pn and gc kinematics ) in 21 early - type galaxies as a pilot study for comparing to our model predictions .",
    "we have found that  in these galaxies increases with @xmath24 ( and with other correlated parameters ) , which is evidence for systematic changes in either the fraction of dark matter or in its radial distribution .",
    "this empirical trend must be explained by any successful model of galaxy properties and formation ( including those advocating alternative theories of gravity ) .",
    "environmental density does not appear to play a key role in producing these trends .    comparing the empirical  values to the @xmath0cdm predictions",
    ", we find a stellar mass scale @xmath353 , and a corresponding luminosity scale of @xmath354 , marking a galaxy dichotomy . the brighter ( more massive ) galaxies @xmath355 show a broad scatter in @xmath1 , but are generally consistent with @xmath93  0.25 .",
    "the fainter ( low - mass ) galaxies are generally only consistent with @xmath93  23 , which is not physically possible in the context of our model assumptions .",
    "+ the brighter galaxies thus appear consistent with the @xmath0cdm picture without need for further complications from baryonic effects . for the fainter galaxies , we have examined some possibilities for explaining their apparent extremely high @xmath1 values ( i.e. , apparent extremely low dark matter fractions ) .",
    "one explanation is that the baryon fraction has not been conserved in these galaxies : either they have acquired large quantities of extra baryons from inflows across the virial radius ( e.g. , gas from nearby starbursting galaxies , which has since formed new stars ) ; and/or they have lost portions of their outer dark haloes ( after star formation ) through dynamical interactions with other galaxies and groups .",
    "we note that the latter process is implicitly included in @xmath0cdm simulations of dark halo formation , but the net effect on @xmath103 has not been explicitly studied .",
    "another explanation is that the predicted relation between halo mass @xmath61 and concentration @xmath69 in @xmath0cdm is wrong , and @xmath69 tends to _ increase _ rather than _ decrease _ with @xmath61 , with @xmath356  16 for @xmath347 galaxies .",
    "similar conclusions have already been reached in studies of low - surface brightness galaxies @xcite , and may indicate that the dark matter is not cdm , or that the baryonic processes involved in galaxy formation have somehow caused the dark haloes to become less centrally - concentrated .",
    "however , the current best guess for baryonic effects is that the cooling and collapse of the gas causes the dark matter halo to also contract adiabatically @xcite , which _ increases _ the central density of the halo .",
    "this is still a viable scenario for the fainter early - type galaxies if the stellar  values are systematically lower by 50% than what we have assumed , and the central dark mass fraction is @xmath35740% .",
    "this possibility merits more investigation , although we note that several studies have concluded that the dark matter can not be so dominant .",
    "both scenarios ( low - concentration haloes ; low stellar ) are possible ways for resolving an apparent empirical inconsistency : weak lensing and satellite dynamics studies find evidence for large amounts of dark matter inside the virial radius in @xmath347 early - types @xcite , while this paper suggests little dark matter inside @xmath358 in similar galaxies .",
    "whatever the case , these data imply a dichotomy in the dark halo profiles between fainter and brighter early - type galaxies ( see section [ corr ] ) , which parallels the dichotomy already visible in the properties of their luminous bodies @xcite , and x - ray properties @xcite , and suggests markedly different formation histories for the two galaxy populations where baryon cooling efficiencies could have played a pivotal role .",
    "the comparison of data and models also supports other studies indicating that @xmath1 is at a maximum for galaxies around @xmath347 @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have briefly discussed the case of dwarf / lsb galaxies and shown that there is the evidence of decreasing @xmath1 from their , supporting this scenario .",
    "we do not wish to over - interpret the implications for @xmath0cdm at this point , since the number of fainter galaxies in the sample is not yet statistically large , and most of them are not yet modelled in enough detail to exclude the potentially important effects of radial anisotropy at large radius .",
    "but this paper highlights the importance of detailed dynamical studies of a larger sample of galaxies , where the distribution of the dark matter as well as the stars may be used as clues to the formation histories of galaxies .",
