    "even with decades of extensive studies , our understanding is still poor as to what physical processes produce the non - maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions ( evdfs ) in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "observations of evdfs at heliocentric distances from 0.3 to 1 au @xcite show a prominent  break \" or a sudden change of slope at a kinetic energy of a few tens of electron volts , suggestive of two electron populations : the  core \" that dominates below the break , and the  halo \" that dominates at higher energies .",
    "in addition , an anisotropic tail - like feature , skewed with respect to the magnetic field direction is found in the evdf of solar wind with speed @xmath0 .",
    "this is called the  strahl \" . in solar wind coming from a sector boundary with speed @xmath1 ,",
    "the strahl is nearly invisible and the isotropic core - halo feature dominates .",
    "kinetic studies suggest that the strahl can result from the trapping of electrons due to large - scale focusing of the interplanetary magnetic field even in the presence of coulomb collisions and turbulent scattering @xcite . however , there is no model that produces the isotropic halo , nor one that predicts the properties of the observed core - halo feature .",
    "@xcite discovered in the solar wind at 1 au a previously unknown population of energetic electrons even during solar quiet - time , which he called  superhalo \" .",
    "it has energies of a few tens kev as was confirmed recently using data from the stereo satellite @xcite .",
    "the superhalo electrons probably arise from nanoflares in the solar corona . in a recent paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) , we postulated that nanoflares can produce electron beams with a broad range of energies .",
    "we extrapolate the superhalo density to the nanoflare - accelerated kev electrons assuming that the beam energy flux is a flat function of electron kinetic energy .",
    "we showed using a particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation that the beam electrons can release their kinetic energy via an electron two - stream instability that leads to production of kinetic turbulence in the solar wind .",
    "one of the important conclusions was the formation of an isotropic electron halo .",
    "given that the above model is largely based on solar wind observations and extrapolations of superhalo constraints , it is critically important to examine if nanoflare - accelerated electrons are sufficient to trigger the strong electron two - stream instability in the context of existing observational and theoretical knowledge of nanoflares . in this letter , we first show that our model assumptions are consistent with existing observations and theoretical estimates of the properties of nanoflares .",
    "we further show that the electron halo forms in the inner corona and can be persevered as the solar wind escapes along open field lines .",
    "then we derive a set of equations that describe the heating mechanism discovered in paper i , and study how the heating mechanism determines the core - halo properties of the evdf .",
    "we show that the solar wind core - halo temperature ratio is a function of the core - halo density ratio and the quasi - saturation condition of the two - stream instability , and is insensitive to the initial condition in the solar corona .",
    "the result can be extended to the more general core - halo - strahl feature .",
    "our theoretical results agree well with observations .",
    "moreover , the formation of the electron halo in the inner corona might have important implications for the models of field line launching and accelerating of solar wind @xcite",
    "small - scale bundled magnetic flux tubes rooted in the photosphere stretch into the solar corona .",
    "photospheric convection leads to the shuffling of foot - points of the magnetic field , and produces magnetic reconnections that eject plasma from the photosphere into the corona along open magnetic field lines .",
    "parker called these events  nanoflares \"  @xcite .",
    "recent high spatial resolution x - ray observations of the sun are providing increasing evidence supporting the existence of nanoflares @xcite .",
    "in particular , the high - resolution coronal imager carried on a nasa sounding rocket discovered a set of fast evolving magnetic loops in the inner - most region of the corona that had lifetimes , sizes and impulsive heating consistent with those expected for nanoflares  @xcite .",
    "typical energy released by nanoflares is @xmath2 ergs , @xmath3 orders of magnitude lower than that of flares  @xcite .",
    "the duration of nanoflares is typically a few seconds and the size of the loops is typically a few hundred kilometers , about one thousandth the size of flare loops @xcite .",
    "the fundamental difference between nano- and normal flares is that nanoflares can continuously occur everywhere in the quiet sun , even in corona holes , while flares only occur in active regions .",
    "the occurrence rate of nanoflares is nearly @xmath4 events / s over the whole sun , even during solar quiet - times .",
    "similar to flares , nanoflares accelerate particles , and the characteristic energy of the accelerated electrons is in the kev range  @xcite .",
    "therefore , nanoflares form a quasi - continuous source of free energy .",
    "in paper i we showed that kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) and whistler wave turbulence , as well as an electron halo , can be produced if the kinetic energy of electron beam is @xmath5 times the thermal energy of the core , and the electron beam density is @xmath6 of the core electron density .",
    "we now examine if these conditions can be satisfied based on estimations using our current knowledge of nanoflares .",
    "we also show where the core - halo forms and whether the feature can survive collisions in the corona before escaping into space .",
    "nearly 50% of the released energy from solar flares is in the kinetic energy of accelerated particles @xcite .",
    "the density of accelerated electrons can be comparable to the coronal density  @xcite . given the similarity between normal and nanoflares , for simplicity we can assume that all the energy released by nanoflares is converted into the electrons kinetic energy of @xmath7  kev .",
    "for the event rate of @xmath8  @xmath9s@xmath10@xcite , the number of kev electrons produced by nanoflares at the corona base should be @xmath11  @xmath9s@xmath10 .",
    "we assume that these kev electrons are uniformly distributed in a thin layer above the surface of the sun with the thickness equals to the average height of nanoflare loops @xmath12  km @xmath13@xcite .",
    "given that the typical duration of nanoflares is a few seconds , the density of kev electrons should be @xmath14@xmath15 . in the inner corona ,",
    "the ambient electron density is @xmath16 @xmath15 and hence @xmath17 .    the observed electron temperature in the inner corona ranges from a few times @xmath18  k to @xmath4  k  @xcite .",
    "the electron temperature of the ambient coronal gas before heating should be @xmath19  k. the kinetic energy of beam electrons is then @xmath20 times higher than the thermal energy of the coronal electrons before the onset of turbulent heating .",
    "therefore , the conditions we adopted in papar i is likely to be satisfied .    in paper",
    "i , we showed that kev electrons can generate kinetic turbulence and produce an electron halo and become demagnetized and thermalized within @xmath21 ion gyro - periods or @xmath22  s , assuming a magnetic field of 1 g  @xcite .",
    "the kev electrons can travel @xmath21  km before thermalization , a distance much smaller than the height of typical magnetic loops .",
    "if the electrons are produced in the inner corona and travel along either magnetic loops or open field lines , the electrons are released to the corona and become the halo within @xmath23 .",
    "the electron coulomb collision rate in the inner corona is @xmath24",
    "s@xmath10 and the coulomb heating time scale is @xmath25 seconds . during this period",
    "the solar wind travels @xmath26 with a velocity of @xmath20  .",
    "thus collisions are insufficient to scatter halo electrons into the core to form a single maxwellian distribution before the expansion of corona convects the turbulent plasma into the outer corona at around @xmath27 where the electron density drops from @xmath28@xmath15 to @xmath29@xmath15  @xcite and can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the core - halo shape is stable to collisional scattering as the solar wind being advected outward to 1  au and beyond @xcite .      to facilitate our discussion of the properties of evdf , we first summarize the pic simulation reported in paper i. the 2.5d pic simulation is initialized in the solar wind reference frame with a uniform magnetic field @xmath30 .",
    "the initial evdf has two maxwellian components that represent the ambient thermal electrons in the corona and the nanoflare - accelerated kev electron stream , respectively . the ratio of the density of the electron beam @xmath31 and that of the ambient electrons @xmath32 is 0.1 .",
    "the relative drift @xmath33 between the two populations is along @xmath34 .",
    "the ratio of the mean kinetic energy of beam electrons @xmath35 and the thermal energy of ambient electrons @xmath36 is 72 ( @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "we now look at the evolution of evdf in the simulation . in fig .",
    "[ dist ] , we show the evdfs @xmath38 and @xmath39 at four times . at the beginning ,",
    "two stream instability is triggered and quickly damps most of the kinetic energy of the electron beam , part of the beam electrons join the ambient electrons and the remaining form a long tail along @xmath40 ( green dashed ) .",
    "this instability nearly saturates on the time scale of the electron plasma frequency @xmath41 . a weibel - like instability",
    "is then triggered and converts the electrostatic waves into electromagnetic waves , which in turn scatters the beam electrons in direction perpendicular to the magnetic field and broadens the narrow tail .",
    "the breakup of the weibel - like waves producing irregular wave - wave interactions further scatters the electrons into different directions . at the final stage",
    "the kaw and whistler wave turbulence evolve to an equilibrium state .",
    "nearly all ( @xmath42 96% ) of the energy in electromagnetic fluctuations is returned to heat the electron tail .",
    "the tail is scattered into a nearly isotropic halo , resulting in a  core - halo \" structure .    in fig .",
    "[ fhalo ] we show @xmath43 and @xmath44 , cross - sections that cut through the center of the simulated 2d evdfs parallel and perpendicular to @xmath34 , respectively , after the core - halo feature becomes stable . for theoretical simplicity and to follow the observational convention of @xcite each of these 1-d evdfs is fitted with two maxwellian functions representing the core and the halo respectively , even though the halo distribution is known to be non - maxwellian . because both the core and the halo are nearly isotropic , the differences between the two 1-d evdfs are very small except for the small drift between the halo and core in the @xmath45-direction .",
    "we found the halo temperature @xmath46 to be @xmath47 times the core temperature @xmath48 , and the core temperature @xmath48 increases by a factor of 4 from the initial temperature @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding thermal velocity of the core is @xmath50 which equals the relative core - halo drift and is the condition for saturation of the electron two - stream instability .",
    "the ratio between the halo density @xmath51 and the core density @xmath52 is @xmath53 , which is about half the initial density ratio between the electron beam and the ambient electrons .    from what we have learned about the turbulence heating processes from our simulation",
    ", we can derive the general properties of core - halo features and relations between these properties .",
    "the evdf  break \" is simply the velocity at which the core and halo maxwellians are equal and can be found as @xmath54^{1/2 } v_{te , c } , \\label{brk}\\ ] ] where we have used the facts that the drift energy of the halo is much smaller than @xmath55 and @xmath56 . for the parameters we adopted in our simulation",
    ", we have @xmath57 .",
    "the efficient heating and scattering by kinetic turbulence allows us to determine with relative ease the final temperature of the core @xmath48 and @xmath58 . during development of the kinetic turbulence ,",
    "the total momentum in the center - of - mass frame is zero .",
    "the two - stream instability quickly achieves quasi - saturation at @xmath59 and the exponential decay ends , where @xmath60 is the parallel temperature .",
    "if the fraction of kinetic energy converted into the heat of core electrons is @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the relative drift when the two - stream instability is at its quasi - saturation .",
    "consequently we have    @xmath64    the perpendicular temperature , on the other hand , is still approximately @xmath49 .",
    "later , wave - wave interactions scatter electrons and transfer the thermal momentum from the parallel to perpendicular direction . part of the beam electrons joins the ambient electrons to form a new core with density @xmath52 .",
    "thus the decrease of the new core s parallel thermal energy from @xmath65 to @xmath66 is equal to the increase in perpendicular thermal energy from @xmath67 to @xmath66 , which leads to @xmath68 .",
    "the final isotropic temperatures of the core @xmath48 and halo @xmath46 satisfy the following energy equations ( ignoring the small fraction of energy stored in the turbulence ) : @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the initial temperature of beam electrons .    since @xmath72 and @xmath73 , from eqs .",
    "( [ tcl])([tc2 ] ) we obtain @xmath74 the final temperatures are much higher than the initial temperatures , then eq .  ( [ dthc1 ] ) can be further simplified as @xmath75 note that in general @xmath76 and hence eq .",
    "( [ dthc2 ] ) slightly overestimates @xmath77 .",
    "( [ dthc2 ] ) shows that @xmath77 depends on the final density ratio @xmath78 and @xmath61 , but is insensitive to the initial condition due to the strong heating process . if @xmath79 then @xmath80 , meaning that if all of the electron beam kinetic energy is converted into the heat of electrons by the two - stream instability , then the temperature ratio is simply determined by the quasi - saturation condition of the two steam instability , the lower limit of @xmath77 . for a conversion fraction @xmath81",
    "as shown in our simulation , the temperature ratio varies from @xmath82 for the reasonable range of @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "one of the unique predictions of our model is the existence of a relic relative drift between the core and the halo along the magnetic field .",
    "the drift equals the core thermal velocity , i.e. , @xmath84 when the two - stream instability fully saturates .",
    "in this letter , based on the existing observations and theoretical constraints of nanoflare properties , we show that nanoflare - accelerated electron streams are likely to trigger sufficiently strong electron two - stream instabilities and produce a core - halo feature of evdf in the inner corona .",
    "the core - halo feature can survive the corona collisions and escape to space from the open field lines .",
    "we show in eq .",
    "[ dthc2 ] that the temperature ratio @xmath77 is related to the quasi - saturation property of the two - stream instability and the density ratio @xmath85 when the turbulence fully saturates .",

    "( [ brk ] ) .",
    "a unique feature of our model is a relative drift between core and halo comparable to the core thermal velocity , a relic of the fully saturated electron two - stream instability .",
    "we now compare the results with the observed evdfs of slow solar wind with speed @xmath86  300 because the slow wind tends to be observed near sector boundaries , where the radial magnetic field is near zero  @xcite , and thus the magnetic focusing effect is weak and less likely to create distortions to the evdf as the solar wind travels away from the sun .",
    "features of evdf such as @xmath77 and @xmath78 could be preserved if the core and halo evolve the same way as the solar wind travels into space .",

    "we find that the drifts agree well with the thermal velocities of the observed cores in this paper a direct consequence of the saturation of the two - stream instability .",
    "the strahl in the solar wind evdfs is likely produced by magnetic focusing as the solar wind travels outward from the sun .",
    "recent studies suggest that the strahl can form at @xmath90 in fast wind  @xcite , well beyond the site where the halo forms .",
    "this is consistent with observations showing that strahl originates from both the core and halo  @xcite .",
    "as the solar wind travels to larger heliocentric distances the strahl should become more and more anisotropic .",
