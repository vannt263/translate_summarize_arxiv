    "in the last decade , the structure and dynamics of nematic droplets have been studied , theoretically and experimentally , due to their key role in novel applications based on polymer dispersed liquid crystals ( pdlcs ) @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the spherical confinement and the molecular alignment at the surface of the droplets leads to the nucleation of topological defects . in general ,",
    "two types of surface alignment ( anchoring ) are considered : homeotropic ( perpendicular ) and planar ( parallel ) .",
    "nematic liquid crystals confined to homeotropic spherical drops can exhibit a radial configuration with a point - like defect , of topological charge @xmath1 , at the center of the drop .",
    "the radial configuration is observed in large droplets , with radii @xmath2 m @xcite . for smaller droplets , however , the nematic texture adopts what is known as an axial configuration with a topological defect ring of cross - sectional winding number @xmath3 .",
    "the competition between the splay energy and the anchoring energy makes the point defect energetically unfavourable against the ring for sufficiently small drops @xcite .",
    "this transition may also be driven by applying an electric field @xcite resulting in distinct optical responses as the field is switched on or off .",
    "on the other hand , if the surface of the nematic drop induces parallel alignment , the droplet exhibits a bipolar configuration with two surface defects ( boojums ) nucleated at antipodal points . in ellipsoidal droplets the defects",
    "are forced to the regions of higher curvature to relieve splay and bend elastic stress @xcite . for some liquid crystals , such as 8cb , planar nematic droplets with a bipolar configuration can undergo a twist transition where the nematic director twists from one surface defect to the other .",
    "this transition is controlled by temperature , which turns twist deformations energetically favourable against bend and splay deformations @xcite",
    ". the twist transition does not affect the type of defects nucleated at the droplet surface .",
    "however , in systems where it is energetically preferable to have bend deformations rather than splay deformations , the nematic takes a concentric configuration with a defect line connecting the poles of the droplet along the symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "planar nematic droplets with bipolar configurations are the most common .",
    "of particular interest are those with prolate shapes that allow the switching between two distinct nematic configurations with the application and removal of an external electric field @xcite .    with the development of new soft - lithographic techniques it is now possible to produce in a controlled fashion new pdlc matrices with nematic droplets of prescribed shapes and non - trivial topologies .",
    "this gave origin to what was coined as topological pdlcs ( tpdlcs ) @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are toroidal shapes , for which the hopf - poincar theorem dictates that the net charge of the defects is @xmath4 , for homogeneous surface alignment .",
    "it turns out that for a torus on the micrometer scale defects may be present in pairs of opposite charge @xcite .",
    "however , as the system size increases the presence of topological defects becomes energetically unstable , and for a torus on the millimeter scale , the nematic texture is completely free from topological defects @xcite .",
    "a topology which is also toroidal is that of a droplet adsorbed around a microfibre @xcite . in this case , however , the system has two confining surfaces that can differ in anchoring : ( @xmath5 ) that of the droplet itself and ( @xmath6 ) the surface of the microfibre .",
    "fabrication of these systems is easily achieved but control of the size of the droplets is limited .",
    "they were reported in @xcite , where 5cb liquid crystal droplets were deposited on @xmath7 m thick fibres through aerosol evaporation .",
    "the droplets , with diameters between @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xmath10 m , are in contact with air and the nematic texture adopts the axial configuration , with a ring defect around the fibre , indicating that the two surfaces have antagonistic anchorings . at the nematic - air interface the 5cb molecules are aligned perpendicular to the interface , implying that the surface of the fibre imposes planar ( or planar degenerate ) alignment .",
    "the advantage of this type of systems arises from the possibility of changing the surface alignment through the adsorption of certain molecules .",
    "for example , endotoxins are known to trigger ordering transitions in nematic droplets from the bipolar ( planar alignment at the surface ) to the radial ( perpendicular alignment ) configuration @xcite .",
    "also , the defect configuration may be strongly deformed with applied electric fields due to the presence of the fibre , which pierces the droplet .",
    "the application of electric fields may change the configuration of the defect in isolated droplets but in most cases a rotation of the nematic texture has been reported @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate the equilibrium textures of nematic droplets adsorbed at fibres for different boundary conditions .",
    "we show that the nucleation of topological defects in the lc matrix depends on the matching ( or mismatching ) anchoring conditions at the fibre and surface of the droplet , and it may be avoided by allowing the nematic molecules to twist around the fibre .",
    "we will focus in particular on the case of homeotropic droplets pierced by a planar fibre and investigate how the system responds to applied external electric fields .",
    "the nematic order of the fluid is expressed using a traceless , symmetric , tensorial order parameter  @xcite called the q - tensor , @xmath11    where @xmath12 is a unit vector denoting the director , and @xmath13 is the degree of nematic ordering . in some circumstances there may be biaxial ordering of degree @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 forming an orthonormal set with @xmath12 .",

    "when the surface of the droplet induces homeotropic anchoring a defect is nucleated in bulk at the center of the drop . as discussed before , this can be either a point defect , which typically appears for large droplets and the nematic has a radial configuration , or a ring defect with a nematic texture that is axial . in fig .",
    "[ diff_drops]@xmath87 a fibre with homeotropic anchoring goes through the center of the nematic drop .",
    "the mere presence of a fibre going through the centre of the drop makes it physically impossible for the defect to nucleate in that same region . in the case of a homeotropic fibre",
    "this is compensated by the nucleation of two surface defects at the contact lines ( see fig.[diff_drops ] in green ) , and no defect is nucleated in bulk . although we did not explore it further , as our droplet is assumed to be rigid , in this situation its shape is expected to elongate .",
    "such elongation would be balanced by the surface tension .",
    "nematic droplets with planar degenerate anchoring can either exhibit a bipolar or concentric texture , as mentioned before .",
    "however , in the presence of a homeotropic fibre , the defects of either configurations are no longer nucleated . in fig.[diff_drops]@xmath88",
    "we see that instead of nucleating topological defects , the nematic assumes an escaped configuration around the fibre , where the director field seems to rotate around the fibre .",
    "this is possible due to the degenerate orientation at the surface of the droplets .",
    "a similar effect is seen when one considers a fibre with planar ( degenerate ) anchoring , shown in figs.[diff_drops]@xmath89 and @xmath90 . in this case",
    "the director field rotates close to the contact lines , clearly seen in fig.[diff_drops]@xmath89 , where the director assumes a perpendicular orientation to the fibre ( symmetry ) axis , while planar to its surface , and as it moves away from the contact line towards the center , the director aligns parallel to the symmetry axis .    finally , if a fibre with planar anchoring pierces a homeotropic droplet the nematic nucleates a topological ring defect close to the fibre as seen in fig.[hybrid_drops]@xmath87 .",
    "this resembles the axial configuration of nematic drops , where the fibre plays the role of the axially uniform nematic .",
    "this configuration is stable for any size of the droplet if the anchoring on the fibre is non - degenerate .",
    "however , if the fibre has planar degenerate anchoring the ring defect is unstable for large systems .",
    "it turns out that by increasing the effective distance between the surface of the nematic drop and the surface of the fibre , while fixing @xmath76 , the nematic molecules are able to rotate around the fibre at the center of the drop , thus removing the topological defect ( fig.[hybrid_drops]@xmath88 ) and assuming an escaped configuration that induces bend - splay deformations ( fig.[hybrid_drops]@xmath89 ) .",
    "such configuration is indeed not reported in the experiments @xcite which hints that the fibre may induce a preferred planar orientation rather than degenerate . for small systems with",
    "planar degenerate anchoring on the fibre the escaped configuration is metastable and can be achieved through the application of an external electric field .",
    "we note that if the surface of the nematic drop is contaminated by an agent that induces planar anchoring the liquid crystal texture would switch from a configuration with a ring defect to a configuration without any topological defects , inducing a different optical response .",
    "homeotropic nematic droplets on fibres with planar anchoring are feasible from the experimental point of view . the appearance of a ring defect around the fibre enhances the potential of such systems for applications , as an external field can induce an orientational state with an optical response that is significantly different from that of the ground state .",
    "here we are interested on the response to applied electric fields . for comparison",
    "we start by assessing the effect of electric fields produced by direct current ( dc ) electrostatic potentials .",
    "alternating current ( ac ) fields will be addressed in the next section .",
    "here we consider that the electric field @xmath56 is perpendicular to the fibre and couples with the nematic lc via the free energy density given in eq.[eqn : felec ] .",
    "when applying an electric field the system will respond in accordance with the competition between the elastic energy , that acts as a restoring force , and the field energy .",
    "if the field is strong enough it will deform the orientational ground state and the system will take a characteristic time to reach the new state that is a product of such competing mechanisms .",
    "figure [ freed ] shows how the free energy @xmath91 changes as the applied dc electric field @xmath56 is increased .",
    "as expected , the system undergoes a freederickzs type transition , well known for flat liquid crystal cells @xcite . here ,",
    "although the geometry of the system is more complex , the response to electric fields seems to be very similar . for weak field strengths , little reorientation of the nematic director occurs",
    ", the elastic strength is strong and the systems remains very close to its ground state configuration . above a critical field strength , @xmath0 , the electric field aligning forces are stronger than the elastic ones and the nematic tends to align with the @xmath56 field , thus deforming completely the zero field state . in fig .",
    "[ freed ] we show the free energy @xmath91 as a function of the applied electric field @xmath56 for ( left ) fixed system size @xmath83 m and different anchoring strengths @xmath92 , and ( right ) fixed anchoring strength @xmath70 and different system sizes @xmath93 m .",
    "@xmath94 is the free energy for @xmath95 and @xmath82 is the volume of the nematic liquid crystal .",
    "for the same system size , increasing the anchoring strength results in an increase of the transition field .",
    "for example , for @xmath83 m increasing the anchoring from @xmath70 to @xmath96 induces the transition field to change from @xmath97 to @xmath98 . on the other hand , for the same anchoring strength @xmath70 ,",
    "changing the system size from @xmath99 m to @xmath100 m has the reverse effect , and the transition field decreases from @xmath97 to @xmath101 . as the anchoring strength is increased the aligning effect of the surfaces gets stronger and it increases the energy cost of uniformly aligning the liquid crystal molecules along the field , which results in a higher transition field .",
    "enlarging the separation between the confining surfaces weakens this effect and the transition field is lower .    to address the response of the system to the electric field ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ efieldsequence ] what happens to the nematic configuration when the field is turned up to a high field strength and then switched off .",
    "when there is no electric field and the system is at equilibrium , the nematic exhibits the axial configuration of fig.[efieldsequence]@xmath87 with a defect ring around the fibre . as the electric field",
    "is switched on up to a value that is below the freederickzs transition ( @xmath102 ) the lc molecules start to align with the field .",
    "this process is counteracted by the elastic stress and the system remains in the axial configuration .",
    "however , we do observe a contraction of the ring defect as an effect of the electric field ( fig.[efieldsequence]@xmath88 ) .",
    "if the field strength is higher than @xmath0 the nematic molecules mostly align with the field . in a nematic droplet ,",
    "as the contraction of the defect becomes unstable , this would lead to a rotation of the defect ring , which would also expand towards the surface of the drop . here , given the presence of the fibre , the ring rotates ( twists ) in two different directions while expanding towards the surface of the drop , transforming the ring into a figure - of - eight , as represented in fig.[efieldsequence]@xmath89 .",
    "when switching off the electric field the elastic stress acts in order to restore the system to a state with lower elastic deformations .",
    "this results in the untwisting of the figure - of - eight defect ( fig.[efieldsequence]@xmath90 ) and the contraction towards the fibre ( fig.[efieldsequence]@xmath103 and @xmath59 ) .    the time it takes for the system to achieve the new state depends on the processes involved .",
    "always present is the elastic stress that acts as a restoring force that takes the system into a state of lower elastic deformation .",
    "when applying an electric field the response of the system depends not just on the restoring effect of the elastic stresses but also on the perturbing / aligning effect of the electric field , and has a characteristic time given by @xmath104 @xcite , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are respectively the characteristic times associated with the elastic and electric stresses .",
    "for very large field strengths @xmath107 . when the electric field is switched off the relaxation time depends solely on the characteristic time due to the elastic stress , @xmath108 .    the relevant characteristic times can be estimated by the dimensional analysis of eq .",
    "[ eqn : berisedwards ] .",
    "this indicates that the characteristic time associated with the elastic stress scales with @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a characteristic length . for ( transient ) configurations close to the ( equilibrium )",
    "axial configuration @xmath111 . in the presence of an electric field",
    "@xmath112 the configuration is extremely different from the equilibrium one given that the defect expands to the surface of the drop . in spherical , or ellipsoidal ,",
    "nematic drops the defect would expand maintaining its ring shape and in that case @xmath113 . in the presence of a piercing fibre",
    "this is no longer the case and @xmath110 is not as trivial to estimate .",
    "there are , however , at least two characteristic time scales associated with elastic stresses .",
    "one that characterizes the time it takes for the distorted ring to regain its equilibrium shape , @xmath114 , and another that is the time it takes for the figure - of - eight defect to untwist , @xmath115 .",
    "we have performed measurements of @xmath116 and @xmath115 , and found that , typically , @xmath117 and that for larger systems ( @xmath118 m ) @xmath119s .",
    "we can also estimate the response time of the nematic to the applied @xmath56 field to scale with @xmath120 .",
    "our measured @xmath106 confirms the @xmath121 dependence .",
    "as @xmath56 increases @xmath106 becomes smaller and the effect of the electric field dominates over the lc elasticity .      in lc",
    "displays it is possible to use either dc or ac fields .",
    "however , ac fields have a practical advantage over dc ones",
    ". ac fields typically produce more stable patterns , lower the threshold voltages and minimize electrochemical deterioration @xcite . in the case of nematic droplets adsorbed at fibres , and in contact with air",
    ", the application of a dc field can disrupt completely the drop , which is pulled towards one of the electrodes .",
    "this is due to ionic impurities in the lc compound that aid the formation of space charges .",
    "however , the effect of free ions can be significantly minimized by the use of ac fields . here",
    "we will not explore the effect of ac _ vs _ dc fields on free ions and how these influence the lc texture , which will be done elsewhere . instead , in this section we aim to address how ac electric fields affect the nematic textures presented in the previous section .",
    "we again consider that the electric field is applied perpendicular to the fibre .",
    "we note that , for both dc and ac fields , if the electric field is oblique to the fibre , this results in a rotation of the defect . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the electric field is sinusoidal and is given by eq.[eqn : eelec ] ( with no dc component ) , such that for frequency @xmath60 we regain the dc limit .",
    "our study reveals that there are three types field strengths @xmath122 to consider : @xmath123 below the freederickzs transition field @xmath124 , @xmath125 just above but close to @xmath0 , and @xmath126 @xmath127 .",

    "is increased the electric field will spend a certain amount of time below @xmath0 which results in an effective response time that is comparable to the restoring time @xmath115 . as a consequence the defect shrinks and assumes a shape normally observed for dc fields close to the freederickzs transition .",
    "the most striking phenomena occurs for fields above the transition but comparable to @xmath0 . as the frequency",
    "is increased the defect regains its nearly circular shape for @xmath124 , indicating that restoring time @xmath116 is effectively smaller than the response time @xmath106 , the elastic stress dominates , and the freederickzs transitions is shifted .",
    "nematic droplets suspended on fibres are new lc systems that very much resemble water droplets on cobwebs .",
    "they differ from the nematic droplets dispersed in a polymer matrix , as the fibre piercing through the droplet confers the droplets a torus - like topology . here",
    "we have studied the equilibrium textures of spherical nematic droplets on fibres under several anchoring conditions .",
    "we have shown that if a nematic droplet with homeotropic anchoring is pierced by a homeotropic fibre two surface defects are nucleated on antipodal positions and at the contact lines , which in principle could be removed by elongating the particle . however ,",

    ", the frequency of the ac field seems to play a small role .",
    "its effects are more pronounced at field strengths just above the freederickzs transition , where instead of the figure - of - eight defect spanning throughout the system we observe a ring defect ( untwisted ) indicating that the ac field shifts the transition to higher field strengths .",
    "we note that in our simulations we did not observe dynamical phenomena similar to that reported in @xcite .",
    "geng and co - workers applied to the system , modelled in this work , an ac field of fixed frequency @xmath133 hz .",
    "they reported that for field strengths below a critical value the ring defect shifted along the fibre in one direction and on the other a spacial soliton seemed to appear rotating with a frequency that depended on the field strength .",
    "we can suggest ( at least ) two reasons for the discrepancy between the dynamics reported for the real system and the behaviour of our model .    the first is related to the size of the systems used in our simulations , which are two orders of magnitude smaller than the physical systems .",
    "the size of the simulated system is limited by the resolution required to describe the defect , of the order of the bulk correlation length , @xmath134 m , which is orders of magnitude smaller than the droplet radius , in the range @xmath8 to @xmath135 m .",
    "the second reason is related to the presence of ionic impurities in the real systems .",
    "ionic impurities may be present in lcs due to molecular degradation , charge injection , or industrial processes .",
    "they may be introduced into the lc matrix during sample assembly through the contamination of substrates or of polymer alignment layers @xcite . in the presence of electric fields",
    "free ions will induce flows @xcite and local distortions of the net electric field , which may dominate the dynamics . including the effect of ions in our simulations is a major task , well beyond the scope of this work .",
