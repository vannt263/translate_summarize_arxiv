    "the analysis of the _ experimental _ data consists of four main steps : ( i ) the experimental stm data at a fixed voltage is first fourier transformed to generate a @xmath4 map . as explained in the main text , these maps are characterized by a random momentum - dependent phase , related to the positions of the impurities .",
    "( ii ) next , the @xmath4 map is multiplied by a planar - wave @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are chosen to maximize the visibility of resulting @xmath1 maps .",
    "this step corresponds to a specific choice for the origin of the axes used to perform the fourier transform .",
    "( iii ) the @xmath1 maps ( [ eq : hmap ] ) are computed by multiplying shifted @xmath4 maps with the complex conjugate of the unshifted map .",
    "( iv ) the real part of the @xmath1 maps is plotted on a colorplot .",
    "the entire procedure would be valid even if step ( ii ) is skipped . in this case",
    "however , each @xmath1 map would be multiplied by a global overall phase factor @xmath64 , with arbitrary @xmath65 . in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave_exp](b ) and ( c ) the relevant factors , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , can lead to a random flip of the overall sign , exchanging red and blue colours .",
    "note however that the phase factor associated with fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave_exp](d ) is @xmath68 . thus ,",
    "although the signs of fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave_exp](b - d ) are arbitrary , their product is uniquely determined .    in our _ theoretical _ calculations we computed the scattering amplitude @xmath69 within the born approximation ( first order perturbation theory in the scatterer strength ) .",
    "specifically , we used @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 is the green s function of a paired state in nambu space and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a pauli matrix , models a local modulation of the pairing gap .",
    "( see ref .",

    "the phenomenological parameters used are ( i ) the band structure of ref .",
    "[ ] ; ( ii ) a chemical potential leading to the luttinger - count doping @xmath74 ; ( iii ) a pairing gap @xmath75mev ; ( iv ) a quasiparticle lifetime @xmath76mev .",
    "the sum over @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gwwg ] ) was performed by evaluating the summand over a grid of 200@xmath78200 points covering the square included between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we verified that the numerical results are stable to small changes of the model , such as details of the phenomenological band - structures , and small changes of the doping and of the pairing gap @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the specific choice of the impurity has important consequences for the shape of the @xmath1 maps ( see [ app : scatterer ] ) , highlighting the non - trivial relation between the source of disorder and the shape of the friedel oscillations . both the theoretical and experimental @xmath1 maps shown in this manuscript refer to the voltage @xmath25mev .",

    "<S> as expected , this map shows two identical patterns , respectively centred around @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> each pattern includes four satellites , which originate from the overlaps between the four inequivalent @xmath51 peaks and their corresponding @xmath52 wave - vectors . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find that these overlap patterns have a local @xmath0-wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this finding indicates that either the @xmath44 pattern has a @xmath2-wave symmetry and each of the @xmath45 patterns has a _ local _ @xmath0-wave symmetry , or vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the former interpretation is consistent with the observed intensity of the ft - sts signal and explains the different visibility of the peaks . because the @xmath4 map in the central brillouin zone is @xmath2-wave symmetric , its intensity is roughly rotational invariant and partially hides the @xmath44 peaks . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath4 map in the first brillouin zone has a local @xmath0-wave symmetry and vanishes along the two diagonals , accentuating the four @xmath45 peaks . combining this information with the above - mentioned @xmath0-form factor ( i.e. the negative sign of the correlations in @xmath46 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the @xmath4 map schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic - gmap](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this map has a global @xmath2-wave symmetry ( i.e. it is invariant under rotations of 90 degrees ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the theoretically predictions shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dwave_th ] were obtained using a wannier function with @xmath0-wave symmetry and gaussian envelope w(*x*)= ( x^2-y^2 ) e^-(x^2+y^2)/(2 ^ 2)[eq : wx ] where @xmath53 sets the global size of the wannier function . in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> this parameter was used as the _ only free fitting parameter_. the best agreement between theory and experiment was obtained for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the unit cell length , leading to the wannier function plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wf](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this wavefunction is significantly narrower than the one predicted by the first - principle calculations of kreisel @xcite , for which @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> an intuitive argument for the relation between this wannier function and the resulting ft - sts maps is provided in [ app : wannier ] . to further highlight the fundamental role of the wannier function on the ft - sts maps , in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory1]-[fig : theory4 ] of the si we present calculations for alternative functions with different size and symmetry . in particular , we consider two families of extended @xmath2-wave wannier functions , respectively proportional to @xmath57 and @xmath58 , ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : wx](b ) and ( c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> while both functions have the same symmetry under rotations by 90 degrees , the resulting @xmath1 maps are very different and only the latter is consistent with the experimental results . on the other hand , we observe that the @xmath1 maps generated by @xmath59 and @xmath60 are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that ft - sts maps depend on the shape of the absolute value of the wannier function and not on its phase symmetry . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> ft - sts maps are always @xmath2-wave symmetric , irrespective of the symmetry of the wannier function . </S>",
    "<S> to discern between @xmath0-wave ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath2-wave ( @xmath60 ) wannier functions it is therefore necessary to invoke additional arguments , such as the physical requirement of the wannier function to be analytic ( to avoid large kinetic - energy costs ) or reasoning based on the relevant atomic orbital ( see for example zhang&rice@xcite ) . in our case , both arguments support the @xmath0-wave wannier function of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : wx ] ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wf](a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we introduced holographic maps ( @xmath1 maps ) as a new tool to analyse fourier - transformed stm images . </S>",
    "<S> these complex maps cancel random phase factors originating from the positions of impurities . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the impurities are predominantly of the same type , the @xmath1 maps reveal intrinsic sign changes , which were previously unnoticed in the commonly used @xmath4 maps . </S>",
    "<S> this information can be exploited to derive the shape of wannier functions of conduction - band electrons in strongly - correlated materials . in the specific case of superconducting cuprates , </S>",
    "<S> our method unveils a wannier function with a @xmath0-wave shape and an extension of about one unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with first - principle calculations@xcite , although the spatial extent is significantly smaller than previously predicted . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis further explains the large visibility of the four satellites that were observed in ft - sts maps of the first brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies interpreted these peaks as evidence of a competing charge density wave @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we offer a simpler interpretation in terms of friedel oscillations and non - trivial wannier functions , and show that the ft - sts maps have a _ global _ @xmath2-wave rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> applications to other strongly - correlated materials are readily viable and may help to solve long - standing debates about the nature of conduction bands in these materials . </S>"
