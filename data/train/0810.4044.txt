    "a torti - rational knot , denoted by @xmath0 , is a knot obtained from the @xmath1-bridge link @xmath2 by applying dehn twists an arbitrary number of times , @xmath3 , along one component of @xmath2 .",
    "( for the precise definition , see section 2 . )",
    "torti - rational knots have occasionally appeared in literatures of knot theory .",
    "for example , twist knots are torti - rational knots .",
    "by @xcite , we know when @xmath5 is unknotted ( see proposition [ prop:8.6++ ] ) .",
    "a torti - rational knot is a @xmath6-@xmath7 knot ( i.e. , admits a genus - one bridge - one decomposition ) , and hence has tunnel number one . in 1991 , morimoto and sakuma @xcite proved that for a satellite knot of tunnel number one , the companion knot is a torus knot @xmath8 and the pattern knot is a torti - rational knot @xmath9 , for some @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "then , goda and teragaito @xcite determined which of such satellite knots of tunnel number one are of genus one .    in this paper , we study torti - rational knots systematically and completely determine the genus of any torti - rational knot and solve a question of when it is fibred .",
    "in fact , we prove the following :    * theorem a*. ( theorems [ thm : c ] and [ thm : a ] ) _ let @xmath12 be an oriented @xmath1-bridge link , with linking number @xmath13 .",

    "see section 2 , for our convention of continued fractions .    to prove these theorems , we construct explicitly a minimal genus seifert surface for @xmath16 and determine whether or not it is a fibre surface for @xmath16 .",
    "proofs of these theorems will be given in sections 10 and 11 .",
    "this work is a part of our project to determine the genus and fibredness of double torus knots ( i.e. , knots embedded in a standard closed surface of genus @xmath1 ) .",
    "see @xcite for a relevant work .",
    "double torus knots are classified into five types ( type @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) . in @xcite , we settled the problem for all double torus knots of type @xmath34 .",
    "a @xmath6-@xmath7 knot can be presented as a double torus knot of type either @xmath35 or @xmath36 . in this paper",
    ", we settle the problem for the @xmath6-@xmath7 knots presented as of type @xmath37 . as an application of our study",
    ", we determine the genus and the fibredness problem for the satellite knots of tunnel number one .",
    "in fact , we show that a similar theorem to theorem a holds true for satellite knots in a slightly wider class .",
    "the precise statements can be found in section 13 .",
    "recently , goda , hayashi and song @xcite study torti - rational knots with a different motivation .",
    "their approach is completely different from ours .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we give precise statements of our main theorems ( theorems [ thm : c ] - [ thm : b ] ) . in section 3 ,",
    "we first introduce several notions needed in this paper , such as _ graphs of continued fractions _ , _",
    "dual graphs_. then we prove that for our study of @xmath5 , we may assume @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath13 is the linking number of @xmath12 .",
    "this restriction simplifies considerably the proofs of our main theorems . at the end of section 3 , we construct a spanning disk of a nice form for one component of the @xmath1-bridge link . in sections 4 and 5 , we study the alexander polynomial of various knots : in section 4 , we determine the alexander polynomials of @xmath5 . in section 5 ,",
    "we prove one subtle property of the ( 2-variable ) alexander polynomial of @xmath2 .",
    "the determination of the degree of the alexander polynomials of @xmath5 depends on this property .",
    "sections 6 is devoted to characterizing the monic alexander polynomial of a knot @xmath0 : first , we deal with knots @xmath5 for the case @xmath40 , and characterize the monic alexander polynomials in terms of a continued fraction of @xmath4 using the formulae given in section 5 . in particular , we give an equivalent algebraic condition for theorem [ thm : a ] ( theorem [ thm:8.4 ] ) .",
    "however , for the case @xmath20 , the monic alexander polynomials of @xmath5 can not be characterized by the continued fractions .",
    "this case is considered in the rest of section 6 , and the characterization will be done using a geometric interpretation of the alexander polynomials of @xmath5 . in section 7 , we construct explicitly a seifert surface for @xmath0 , which in most cases is of minimal genus . in section 8 , we prove theorem [ thm : c ] . in this case , some of the surfaces constructed in section 7 are not of minimal genus , but we obtain minimal genus surfaces after explicitly compressing them . in section 9 , we prove theorem [ thm : a ] . in sections 10 and 11 , we prove theorems [ thm : d ] and [ thm : b ] .",
    "various examples that illustrate our main theorems are discussed in section 12 . in section 13 , we consider the satellite knot with fibred companion and @xmath0 , @xmath41 , as a pattern , and prove an analogous theorem to theorem a. in the final section , section 14 , we determine the genus one knots in our family of knots @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we find satellite knots among them , and hence give a negative answer to the problem posed in @xcite .",
    "after is this paper was completed , d. silver pointed out that 5.5 in this paper makes it possible to prove theorem a algebraically using brown s graphs in @xcite ( without explicit construction of minimal genus seifert surfaces ) .",
    "however , brown s method does not work for proving theorem b.",
    "we begin with an ( even ) continued fraction of a rational number @xmath42 , and gcd@xmath43 .",

    "note that @xmath48 is odd . throughout this paper , we consider only even continued fraction expansions , and hence omit the word even .",
    "now , using the continued fraction of @xmath49 , we can obtain a diagram of an oriented @xmath1-bridge link @xmath12 as follows .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51be artin s generators of the @xmath52-braid group . first construct a @xmath52-braid @xmath53 .",
    "close @xmath54 by joining the first and second strings ( at the both ends ) and then join the top and bottom of the third string by a simple arc as in 2.1 .",
    "we give downward orientation to the second and third strings .",
    "2.1 shows the ( oriented ) @xmath1-bridge link obtained from the continued fraction @xmath55=[[1,1,-1,-1,1]]$ ] .",
    "now an oriented @xmath1-bridge link @xmath12 consists of two unknotted knots @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath57 is formed from the third and fourth strings .",
    "our convention for the orientation of a @xmath1-bridge link is not standard , but is used for the convenience in utilizing the @xmath1-variable alexander polynomials .",
    "( usually we reverse the orientation of one component so that the @xmath1-bridge link is fibred if and only if all the entries of the even continued fraction are  @xmath58 . )    since @xmath57 is unknotted , @xmath56 can be considered as a knot in an unknotted solid tours @xmath59 and @xmath57 is a meridian of @xmath59 . then by applying dehn twists along @xmath57 in an arbitrary number of times , say @xmath3 , we obtain a new knot @xmath16 from @xmath56 .",
    "we denote this knot @xmath16 by @xmath5 , or simply @xmath60 .    more precisely , one dehn twist along @xmath57 is the operation that replaces the part of @xmath56 in a cylinder by the braid @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the wrapping number .",
    "( since @xmath12 is symmetric , @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be interchanged , and hence this notation is justified . )    we note that if @xmath63 , then @xmath5 is unknotted for any @xmath11 , and henceforth we assume @xmath23 unless otherwise specified .",
    "now , given an oriented @xmath1-bridge link @xmath12 , let @xmath64 be the linking number between @xmath56 and @xmath57 which , for simplicity , is denoted by @xmath65 .",
