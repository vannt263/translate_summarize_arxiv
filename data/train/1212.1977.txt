    "a radio labeling of a graph is a generalization of vertex coloring . given a graph @xmath1 ( for us",
    ", @xmath1 is simple and connected ) with vertex set @xmath9 , any function @xmath3 is a labeling of the vertices .",
    "if that labeling satisfies the inequality @xmath10 for all distinct vertices @xmath11 , then @xmath12 is a coloring of @xmath1 .",
    "this inequality is exactly the condition needed to guarantee that adjacent vertices are labeled with a different  color \" .",
    "we can generalize this notion of graph coloring by changing the inequality to the following : @xmath13 for some @xmath14 , @xmath15 . a labeling satisfying this inequality for all vertices",
    "@xmath16 is called a @xmath2-radio labeling @xcite . in particular , it guarantees that any two vertices that are @xmath2 apart or less in distance have different labelings ( which is the reason that @xmath2 is bounded above by @xmath17 ) .",
    "when @xmath8 , we call a @xmath2-radio labeling simply a radio labeling , and we call inequality the radio condition",
    ".    radio labeling is connected to the channel assignment problem , which aims to assign frequencies ( channels ) to radio transmitters in a way that minimizes interference .",
    "so , if two transmitters are geographically close , it is optimal to have their frequencies be far apart .",
    "this directly relates to the idea of radio labeling of a graph by thinking of the vertices as radio transmitters and the labels as radio frequencies ( hence the name ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "just as with vertex coloring , we are interested in minimizing the largest label given to a vertex . for any particular labeling , the largest label used is called the span of the labeling . in vertex coloring , the minimum possible span of a graph",
    "is called its chromatic number . in radio labeling , the minimum span",
    "is called the radio number , denoted @xmath18 . finding a closed formula for the radio numbers of different types of graphs is the goal , but it remains unknown for all but a handful of them @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "even the discrete problem of finding the radio number of a specific example @xmath1 can be difficult because of the size of the computation .",
    "one way of finding the radio number involves analyzing all possible permutations of the vertices .",
    "given a radio labeling @xmath12 of a graph with vertices @xmath19 , we can rename ( order ) the vertices as @xmath20 so that @xmath21 if and only if @xmath22 . on the other hand , we can produce a radio labeling of a graph by picking an ordering of the vertices and then forcing the labels to increase with respect to that order . since we are interested in minimizing span , we always choose the smallest label that works at the given moment .",
    "therefore , an ordering of the vertices uniquely determines a radio labeling if we enforce this increasing condition .",
    "it is this radio labeling we refer to when we speak of the radio labeling `` induced '' by the ordering .",
    "so , one brute force way of computing the radio number of a graph is to consider all radio labelings induced from all possible orderings ( permutations ) of the vertices , and then choose the smallest span of all of them .",
    "even after an ordering is fixed , producing the induced radio labeling is nontrivial , so producing @xmath23 labelings is computationally very intense .      unlike all other @xmath2-radio labelings of a graph ,",
    "if @xmath8 , then no two distinct vertices can have the same label ; this tells us that @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 , then there is a radio labeling of @xmath1 of consecutive integers @xmath26 .",
    "such a labeling is called a consecutive radio labeling .",
    "the complete graph @xmath27 of @xmath28 vertices is an example of a graph that has such a labeling .",
    "since @xmath29 , the radio condition is trivially satisfied , so any labeling with consecutive integers will work .",
    "a more interesting example is that of the peterson graph ( figure [ fig : petersongraph ] ) .",
    "its diameter is 2 , so the radio condition is not satisfied for all possible consecutive labelings , but it does have a consecutive radio labeling .        the qualities that the peterson graph possesses that allow it to have a consecutive radio labeling can be boiled down to the following : it is a diameter 2 graph that has an ordering of its vertices such that each vertex is diameter away from the next vertex in the ordering .",
    "the existence of such an ordering of the vertices is a rare property for a graph to have , but this alone will not always be sufficient to produce a graph with a consecutive radio labeling .",
    "it is only because we also had a graph of diameter 2 in this case that the qualifications were so simple .    in general , for a graph @xmath1 with vertices",
    "@xmath30 , we would need an ordering of the vertices @xmath31 such that @xmath32 this gives an idea of how special graphs that have consecutive radio labelings are , and how difficult it can be to produce examples of them , particularly examples of high diameter .      a tool we will be using in our construction is the cartesian product of graphs .",
    "given two graphs @xmath1 and @xmath33 , their cartesian product , denoted @xmath34 , is a graph defined by the following :    * the vertex set @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 .",
    "* two vertices @xmath37 are adjacent if the vertices in one coordinate are the same , and the vertices in the other coordinate are adjacent in their respective original graph .",
    "that is , if * * @xmath38 and @xmath5 is adjacent to @xmath39 in @xmath33 , or * * @xmath40 and @xmath4 is adjacent to @xmath41 in @xmath1 .",
    "see figure [ fig : k3boxp3 ] for an example .    ]",
    "one very nice property of the cartesian product of graphs is that distance is inherited from the original graphs : @xmath42 this allows us to learn about @xmath43 by looking at @xmath18 and @xmath44 .",
    "we will be considering the cartesian product of @xmath45 copies of a graph @xmath1 , denoted @xmath46 : @xmath47 vertices of @xmath46 can be represented as @xmath45-tuples with entries in @xmath9 , and there is an edge between two vertices @xmath48 and @xmath49 if , for some @xmath50 , @xmath51 is adjacent to @xmath52 in @xmath1 , and @xmath53 for all @xmath54",
    ".    the graph of @xmath46 can be quite complicated , even if @xmath1 itself is simple .",
    "( the number of vertices of @xmath46 is @xmath55 and , if @xmath56 denotes the set of edges in @xmath1 , then @xmath46 has @xmath57 edges . )",
    "distance is given by @xmath58 diameter is then easily computed : @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath1 has a consecutive radio labeling , we will be looking at @xmath46 for new examples of graphs with such a labeling .",
    "since @xmath60 increases as @xmath45 does , we have some hope of finding high diameter examples by looking here .",
    "actually , one example is well known .",
    "we have already seen that the peterson graph ( which we will hereafter denote @xmath61 ) has a consecutive radio labeling ( figure [ fig : petersongraph ] ) .",
    "a consecutive radio labeling can also be exhibited for the diameter 4 graph @xmath62 .",
    "this finding is exciting for the cause for finding higher diameter examples , and it can spark some ( very optimistic ) conjectures .",
    "for example , it is tempting to hope that @xmath63 has a consecutive radio labeling for all @xmath64 .",
    "this is desirable because if @xmath45 is unbounded above then so is @xmath65 .",
    "it is nt true , however , as we will see in @xmath66[highpowers ] .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to prove an even better result in the following section .",
    "better because it produces a family of examples with consecutive radio labelings in which there is an example for every possible diameter ( whereas @xmath63 has even diameter ) .",
    "we construct a family of examples of arbitrary diameter that have consecutive radio labelings by taking cartesian powers of the complete graph @xmath27",
    ". we will begin by giving an ordering and @xmath67 , then this recursive definition is an ordering on @xmath68 : @xmath69 where we use the convention that @xmath70 . ] of the vertices of @xmath71 , and then prove that this ordering induces a consecutive radio labeling .",

    "consider @xmath71 where @xmath75 .",
    "we describe the desired ordering of the vertices of @xmath71 in groups of @xmath28 vertices at a time .",
    "the first @xmath28 vertices are the @xmath45-tuples @xmath76 for the sake of easier reference , we will think of these @xmath28 vertices as an @xmath77 matrix @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the @xmath80th coordinate of @xmath81 .",
