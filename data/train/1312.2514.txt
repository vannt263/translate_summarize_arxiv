    "however , @xmath362 does not admit a degree-4 pencil , which contradicts the biellipticity of @xmath364 the only possibility is that @xmath359 factors through a double covering of a smooth plane cubic ; the latter map must be @xmath365 by the uniqueness of the bielliptic structure on @xmath364    * case 2 : * @xmath366 castelnuovo s bound yields different inequalities depending on whether @xmath367 @xmath368 or @xmath369 however , a straightforward comparison of these implies that if @xmath359 is birational onto its image for @xmath302 we have @xmath370 which is impossible . therefore @xmath359 must factor through a covering of a nondegenerate curve @xmath371 of degree at least 2 and at most @xmath4 the nondegeneracy implies that @xmath372 must be of degree @xmath373 or @xmath324 but since @xmath373 can not divide @xmath374 we conclude that the degree of @xmath372 must be @xmath324 so that the covering @xmath375 is of degree 2 .",
