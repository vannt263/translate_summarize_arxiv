    "much interest and many questions have been raised by the recent discovery of deep and extremely sharp indentations in the surface phonon spectra of h / mo(110 ) and h / w(110 ) at full hydrogen coverage  @xcite ( see fig.[fanom ] ) .",
    "those anomalies are seen at an incommensurate wavevector , @xmath2 , along the @xmath3 $ ] direction ( @xmath4 ) and additionally at the commensurate wavevector @xmath5 at the boundary of the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) . out of the ordinary rayleigh mode",
    "two simultaneous anomalies develop at those points . one ,",
    "@xmath6 , is extremely deep , and is only seen by helium atom scattering ( has ) .",
    "the other , @xmath7 , is instead soft , and is observed by both has and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ( hreels )  @xcite .",
    "a pronounced but less sharp softening of surface phonons is also seen on the clean ( 001 ) surfaces of w  @xcite and mo  @xcite .",
    "there , the effect can be explained in terms of a nested structure of the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "however , for the phonon anomalies of h / w(110 ) and h / mo(110 ) such a connection between the electronic structure and the vibrational properties seemed to be non - existent since angular resolved photoemission ( arp ) experiments of the two systems gave no evidence for nesting vectors comparable to the has determined critical wave vectors  @xcite .",
    "an alternative model which links the phonon anomalies to the motion of the hydrogen adatoms  @xcite has to be ruled out because the has spectra remain practically unchanged when deuterium is adsorbed instead of hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "another puzzle is added by the observation of a symmetry loss in the low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) pattern of w(110 ) upon h - adsorption .",
    "the phenomena may be caused by a h - induced displacement of the top layer w atoms along the @xmath8 $ ] direction  @xcite ( see figs.[fadso]b and c ) .",
    "similar studies for h / mo(110 ) do not provide any evidence for a top - layer - shift reconstruction  @xcite .    within a first - principles approach ,",
    "the goal of our work is to give a comprehensive explanation for the observed anomalous behavior and clarify the confusing picture drawn by the different experimental findings .",
    "we perform density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations using the local - density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation energy functional  @xcite . for the self - consistent solution of the kohn - sham equations a full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) code  @xcite",
    "is employed which we enhanced by the direct calculation of atomic forces  @xcite . within a damped molecular dynamics approach",
    "this enables an efficient determination of fully relaxed atomic geometries and frozen - phonon energies . for methodical details",
    "we refer to ref  @xcite . in the case of the w surfaces the valence and",
    "semi - core ( core ) electrons are treated scalar ( fully ) relativistically while for mo all electrons are handled non - relativistically .",
    "the in - plane lattice constants @xmath9  and @xmath10   are calculated without including zero - point vibrations .",
    "they are in good agreement with the respective measured bulk lattice parameters at room temperature which are 3.163  and 3.148  for w  @xcite and mo  @xcite , respectively .",
    "we performed systematic tests comparing the lda and the generalized gradient approximation  @xcite exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "for the quantities reported in this paper ( total energy differences of different adsorption sites , bond lengths , etc . ) both treatments give practically the same results .",
    "also , we checked the @xmath11-point convergence : in the case of atomic and electronic structure calculations a two - dimensional linear mesh of 64 @xmath11-points within the @xmath12 sbz gives stable results .",
    "for the evaluation of frozen - phonon energies a set of 56@xmath11-points is employed within the sbz of the enlarged @xmath13 and @xmath14 surface cells .",

    "the relaxation parameters presented in table  [ tstructure ] are calculated for a nine - layer slab ( the parameters are defined in fig .",
    "[ fadso]d ) .",
    "the results , which are remarkably similar for mo and w , are in excellent quantitative agreement with a recent leed analysis  @xcite .    as the energetically most favorable hydrogen adsorption site on both w(110 ) and mo(110 )",
    "we identify a quasi - threefold position ( indicated as h in fig.[fadso]a ) .",
    "our investigations also throw light on the suggested model of a h - induced structural change : for both materials the calculated shift @xmath17 is only of the order of 0.01  and thus there is no evidence for a pronounced top - layer - shift reconstruction .",
    "moreover , this subtle change in the surface geometry is unlikely to be resolved experimentally due to zero - point vibrations .",
    "this aspect becomes evident by evaluating the total energy with respect to a rigid top - layer - shift . in fig .",
    "[ fshift ] we present the results of such a calculation for h / w(110 ) and depict the first three vibrational eigenstates obtained from a harmonic expansion of the total energy @xmath49 ; for h / mo(110 ) the energetics is similar .",
    "since we have @xmath50mev at room temperature thermal fluctuations of @xmath17 are of the order of 0.1 .",
    "this is considerably larger than the theoretically predicted absolute value of @xmath17 .      the similarities between mo(110 ) and",
    "w(110 ) found for the surface geometries continue when we compare the electronic structures .",
    "for both systems the h adsorption alters the surface potential and induces the shift of a band with @xmath51 character to higher binding energies  @xcite . due to this effect",
    "which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fband ] the fermi line associated with this band is moved into the band gap of the surface projected band structure , and the respective states become true surface states .    the shifted @xmath51 band is characterized by a high density of states at the fermi level .",
    "more important , the new fermi contour shows pronounced nesting features ( see fig .  [",
    "ffermi]c ) .",
    "the magnitudes of the calculated nesting vectors and has measured critical wavevectors along @xmath52 and @xmath53 are listed in table  [ tnesting ] . for both systems",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent .",
    ".theoretical fermi - surface nesting vectors compared to critical wavevectors obtained by has and hreels experiments  .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tphonon ]    fortunately , at @xmath54 such a calculation is particularly convenient , since at the zone boundary point @xmath55 the rayleigh - wave polarization is purely vertical , and the second layer is immobile by symmetry .",
    "the calculated frequencies for the @xmath55-point and a second zone boundary point , @xmath56 , are presented in table  [ tphonon ] . for the latter our results",
    "reproduce the experimentally observed increase of the rayleigh wave frequency as hydrogen is adsorbed . at the @xmath57 point",
    "we find that those stiffening effects are over - compensated : the strong coupling to electronic states at the fermi level leads to a lowering of the phonon energy in good agreement with the experimental results .    in fig .",
    "[ fkohn ] we schematically illustrate the mechanism which is responsible for this effect .",
    "it is , in fact , a text - book example of a kohn anomaly due to fermi - surface nesting  @xcite : ( a ) within the unperturbated system the ( @xmath58 ) band cuts the fermi level exactly midway between @xmath59 and @xmath55 .",
    "( b ) the @xmath55-point phonon couples to the states at the fermi level and causes the backfolding of the sbz .",
    "( c ) the nuclear distortion associated with the @xmath55-point phonon modifies the surface potential and hence removes the degeneracy at the new zone boundary point @xmath60 .",
    "the occupied states are shifted to lower energies .",
    "this amounts to a negative contribution of the electronic band structure energy to the total energy and thus a lowering of the phonon energy .",
    "a frozen - phonon study for the second nesting vector along @xmath53 is not performed because @xmath2 is highly non - commensurate ; a calculation would be very expensive .",
    "however , since the character of the @xmath51 band does not change when shifting from the @xmath52 to the @xmath53 nesting we expect similar results .",
    "the calculation of the electron - phonon interaction at the mo(110 ) and w(110 ) surfaces and its change due to hydrogen adsorption pinpoints the phonon character of the small anomaly @xmath7 and identifies the interplay between the electronic structure and the vibrational spectra of the transition metal surfaces .",
    "thus , our results which were recently confirmed by bungaro  @xcite within the framework of perturbation dft clearly support the interpretation that the small dip observed by both has and hreels is due to a kohn anomaly .      for the deep and sharp anomaly @xmath6",
    "the interpretation is less straightforward , particularly since it is only seen in the has spectra .",
    "one needs to understand the nature of rare - gas scattering in order to explain this unusual behavior .    in a recent study we found that those scattering processes are significantly more complicated ( and more interesting ) than hitherto assumed  @xcite : the reflection of the he atom happens in front of the surface at a distance of 23 .",
    "more important , it is not the _ total _ electron density of the substrate surface which determines the interaction but the electronic wave functions close to the fermi level . in the case of the h / w(110 ) and h / mo(110 ) systems it is thus plausible to assume that the he atom couples directly to the @xmath51 surface states mentioned above and excites electron - hole pairs .    in order to analyze the spectrum of those excitations in some more detail we evaluate the imaginary part of the electronic susceptibility @xmath61 within random phase approximation ( rpa ) : @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the @xmath11-space density . in our approach",
    "we use all eigenvalues @xmath64 and occupation numbers @xmath65 obtained via a nine - layer slab calculations . also , we take into account the localization @xmath66 of the respective state at a distance of 2.5  in front of the substrate surface .",
    "the results obtained for mo(110 ) and h / mo(110 ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fsusc ] : for the clean surface we find that the intensity of the electron - hole excitations decreases continuously as we move away from the @xmath59 point towards the zone boundaries .",
    "this relatively smooth behavior of the susceptibility is modified considerably when h is adsorbed on the clean surface : pronounced peaks appear , in particular one which stretches from the @xmath53 line through the sbz to the symmetry point @xmath55 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the has results .",
    "also , there is a peak located at the second half of the @xmath67 symmetry line .",
    "it can not be associated with an anomaly in the has spectrum .",
    "this result may be due to the fact that selection rules for the interaction between the scattering he atoms and the electron - hole excitations are not considered .    in view of the simplicity of the approach",
    ", the calculated spectrum of electron - hole excitations however seems to be well - connected to the has measurements .",
    "moreover , it is surprising how detailed the fermi surface nesting is reflected in the susceptibility at such a large distance from the surface where the has scattering process takes place .",
    "this finding supports the earlier suggestion  @xcite that the giant indentations , seen only in has , are due to the excitation of electron - hole pairs .",
    "by contrast , in hreels experiments the electrons are directly scattered at the atoms and thus only measure the phonon spectrum .",
    "therefore , the strong anomaly is invisible for hreels .",
    "in conclusion , the major results of our work are as follows : we demonstrate that both the w(110 ) and the mo(110 ) surface do not show a pronounced top - layer - shift reconstruction upon adsorption of hydrogen , a result confirmed by a recent leed analysis  @xcite .",
    "also , we give a consistent explanation for the h - induced anomalies in the has spectra of w(110 ) and mo(110 ) .",
    "the h adsorption induces surface states of @xmath51 character that show pronounced fermi - surface nesting .",
    "the soft anomalous dip is clearly identified as a kohn anomaly due to those nesting features  @xcite . for an understanding of the huge dip one needs to take into account that the scattering of rare - gas atoms is crucially influenced by interactions with substrate surface wave functions at the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "the he atom couples efficiently to the h - induced surface states on h / w(110 ) and h / mo(110 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the deep branch of the anomaly is predominantly caused by a direct excitation of electron - hole pairs during the scattering process .",
    "we hope that our first - principles study stimulates some more experimental work : for instance , the liquid - like behavior of the h adatoms observed in the hreels measurements  @xcite is still not understood .",
    "one would also like to know whether the has and hreels spectra of the mo@xmath0re@xmath1(110 ) alloy system reveal h - induced anomalies as expected .",
    "finally , we call for a new arp study of the clean and h - covered mo(110 ) and w(110 ) surface and think that scattering experiments with atoms or molecules like ne or h@xmath68 might provide additional insight into the interesting behavior of these surfaces .      e.hulpke and j.ldecke , , 2846 ( 1992 ) ; j. electron . spectr",
