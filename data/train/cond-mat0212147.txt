    ", one can adjust the mean velocity @xmath19 from 0 to @xmath20  m / s .",
    "the injecting mot is set up in a rectangular glass cell ( 130  mm @xmath21 50  mm @xmath21 50  mm ) . for most of the experimental results presented here ,",
    "the atoms are captured from the low - pressure background gas ( setup a ) .",
    "the partial pressure @xmath22 for @xmath4rb is measured by the absorption of a resonant beam .",
    "it can be varied from @xmath23 mbar up to the saturated vapor pressure at room temperature ( @xmath24 mbar ) by controlling the temperature of the rb - reservoir or the aperture of the intermediate valve .",
    "we find that the steady state flux @xmath25 is independent of the average velocity of the beam .",
    "this flux is proportional to @xmath22 in the range @xmath23  mbar @xmath26  mbar , and we obtain : @xmath27    we have just completed the construction of a new apparatus ( setup b , see fig .  [ setup](a ) ) which has some advantages over this original system .",
    "this apparatus is based on the same principle as setup a , but it uses two separate magneto - optical traps .",
    "the first one is a two - dimensional magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite located in a chamber which has a relatively high pressure of rubidium vapor ( @xmath28 mbar ) .",
    "the second mot ( the injecting one ) is in a differentially pumped chamber where the pressure is very low ( @xmath29 mbar ) .",
    "the first mot generates a beam of cold atoms with an average velocity @xmath30 m/s ; a significant fraction of this beam is captured by the injecting mot and is subsequently slowed down and cooled .",
    "this allows us to limit the loss of atoms caused by collisions with background gas atoms while they propagate from the output of the injecting mot to the entrance of the magnetic guide .",
    "( a ) schematic drawing of the experimental setup .",
    "( b ) miniature magnetic guide placed at the entrance of the magnetic guide.,width=302 ]",
    "the magnetic guide has a total length of 230  cm .",
    "it is made out of four copper tubes ( @xmath31  mm and @xmath32  mm ) placed in a quadrupole configuration ( see fig .  [ guide ] ) .",
    "the tubes are located in the domain @xmath33 and they are joined in @xmath34 by a hollow metal cylinder , which allows for the circulation of current and cooling water from tube to tube .",
    "the axes of the copper tubes are placed at coordinates @xmath35 , with @xmath36  mm .",
    "a current @xmath37  a is sent through the tubes , which provides , far from the entrance of the guide ( _ i.e. _ @xmath38 ) , a magnetic gradient @xmath39  t / m in the @xmath40 plane .",
    "the transverse magnetic gradient at the edge of the magnetic guide decreases quite fast ( typical length scale @xmath41 ) , so it does not affect the operation of the injecting mot",
    ".     schematic drawing of the entrance of the magnetic guide .",
    "the hollow metal cylinder close to @xmath34 allows for the connection of the electrical currents and the water cooling circuit circulating into the four copper tubes.,width=245 ]    a narrow glass tube ensures differential pumping between the cell of the injecting mot and the chamber of the magnetic guide , where the residual pressure has to be minimized to avoid losses due to collisions with the background gas .",
    "we estimate that the pressure in this chamber is @xmath42  mbar , which corresponds to a lifetime @xmath43  s for the magnetically guided atoms .",
    "we now present the various schemes that we have investigated to transfer the cold atomic beam generated by the injecting mot into the magnetic guide .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) shows that we need a guided beam as intense and cold as possible ( a large collision rate @xmath1 ) and at the same time a very low mean velocity @xmath19 .",
    "we note that , due to the presence of the metal cylinder located at the entrance of the magnetic guide ( see fig .",
    "[ guide ] ) , the shortest distance between the output of the injecting mot and the entrance of the magnetic guide is @xmath44  mm . in other words ,",
    "the injecting mot is located in the region @xmath45  mm @xmath46  mm and the atoms have to travel over a distance of @xmath47  mm before being captured by the magnetic guide provided that they are in a magnetic sublevel corresponding to a low - field seeking state .",
    "the simplest way to load atoms from the injecting mot into the guide consists in letting the atoms propagate freely between the two . in this purpose , we place a laser tuned to the @xmath48 transition in the region @xmath49  mm  @xmath50 .",
    "the repumping laser is blocked in this transfer region , so that the extra  depumping \" laser beam optically pumps the atoms in the @xmath51 ground state .",
    "therefore , provided that the three magnetic levels @xmath52 of the @xmath53 are equally populated , we expect that one third of the atoms ( state @xmath54 ) emerging from the injecting mot can be captured by the magnetic guide .",
    "due to our experimental geometry , there are two issues that limit the use of a free flight transfer :    * it is restricted to relatively large velocities @xmath55  m / s .",
    "otherwise the free - fall due to gravity , @xmath56 , is so large that the coupling to the guide becomes velocity - dependent .",
    "* during the free flight , the atom jet spreads transversally , which leads to a strong increase of the transverse temperature @xmath57 in the guide , as compared with the temperature in the injecting mot .",
    "consider for instance a beam emerging from the injecting mot with @xmath58  m / s and @xmath59k . at the entrance of the magnetic guide",
    ", the radius of the beam is @xmath60  mm ( @xmath61 is the atomic mass ) .",
    "the corresponding magnetic energy is @xmath62 this gives @xmath63  mk in the present case .",
    "the operation of the injecting mot in a continuous mode imposes to search for a compromise between two different requirements . for an efficient loading one has to take a relatively small detuning ( @xmath64 ) , so that the trapping force is large . on the contrary , in order to minimize the temperature of the outgoing atomic beam , a much larger detuning @xmath65 for our laser intensity ) is preferable .",
    "a pulsed operation of the injecting mot may provide , for a given application , an output beam with better characteristics than this compromise .",
    "first , one loads the injecting mot with the detuning which maximizes the capture rate @xmath66 and with a zero launch velocity ( @xmath67 ) . during this phase of duration @xmath68",
    ", the number of trapped atoms varies according to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the mean escape time .",
    "one then switches the detuning of the trapping lasers to a much larger value , with @xmath71 set to provide the required velocity @xmath19 .",
    "this launching phase must last a time @xmath72 so that all trapped atoms can leave the injecting mot and reach the magnetic guide . for a trap of length @xmath73 and a distance @xmath74 between the trap exit and the guide",
    ", one has @xmath75 .",
    "the optimization of @xmath68 depends on the values of @xmath1 and the launching time @xmath76 . for a low rb vapor pressure ( small @xmath66 and small @xmath1 )",
    ", the largest flux corresponds to @xmath77 in this case , the flux @xmath25 in the guide is equal to the capture rate of the injecting mot and the operation in pulsed mode does not lead to a loss in efficiency .",
    "if we increase the rb vapor pressure in the cell and thus the rate @xmath66 so that @xmath78 , the optimum operation of the pulsed mode corresponds to @xmath79    this pulsed mode also makes the extraction of atoms from the injecting mot much easier .",
    "indeed , the optical pumping of the atoms to the hyperfine level @xmath51 is not total , because of the stray light present at the repumping frequency @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , after leaving the injecting mot , the atoms may still be deflected by the residual radiation pressure force resulting from an imbalance between the intensities of the various laser beams .",
    "this spurious effect is strongly decreased if the detuning of these lasers is increased to a value @xmath81 while the atoms travel in the  dangerous \" region .",
    "finally , we note that , although the atomic beam is pulsed at the entrance of the guide , the pulses broaden as they propagate because of the longitudinal velocity dispersion @xmath82 .",
    "this entails that a quasi - continuous beam is obtained after a distance @xmath83 if one chooses @xmath84 .",
    "some of the difficulties associated with the free - flight transfer can also be circumvented if we place an auxiliary guiding trap in the region @xmath49  mm @xmath50 .",
    "this trap is a pure 2d mot , whose beams are orthogonal to the @xmath5 axis and illuminate points up to 4  mm from the entrance of the magnetic guide ( see fig .",
    "[ auxmot ] ) .",
    "the transverse extension of the atomic beam at the entrance of the magnetic guide is then drastically reduced . as for the free flight transfer , we place a depumping laser at the entrance of the guide .",
    "the atoms are then trapped in the magnetic sublevel @xmath85 .",
    "use of an auxiliary 2d mot to transfer the atoms from the injecting mot to the magnetic guide.,width=226 ]    the disadvantage of this auxiliary trap concerns the broadening of the longitudinal velocity distribution , due to the random recoils associated with the spontaneous emission of photons as the atoms cross the auxiliary trap .",
    "the longitudinal heating remains relatively weak for high atomic velocities and large detunings @xmath86 of the auxiliary mot .",
    "an upper limit for @xmath87 is given only by the condition that the radiative force of the auxiliary mot has to overcome the spurious radiation pressure imbalance which exists in the wings of the injecting mot s laser beams , as discussed above .",
    "we now present the experimental results that we have obtained concerning the characteristics of the guided atomic beam , in terms of temperature and flux .",
    "all these measurements have been performed using the setup a , i.e. with a vapor - loaded injecting mot .",
    "the measurement of the longitudinal velocity distribution is quite straightforward if we operate the injecting mot in pulsed mode , since we can derive the longitudinal temperature directly from the temporal width of the absorption signal when a given atom pulse passes through the probe beam .",
    "this beam is located downstream , at a distance of either 40  cm or 200  cm from the entrance of the magnetic guide .",
    "when operating in pulsed mode , we measure a longitudinal temperature in the range 50 - 100  @xmath88k .",
    "the lowest temperatures are obtained for large velocities ( @xmath89  m / s ) .",
    "this effect is probably due to the heating of the atoms by the stray light of the various trapping beams , when they travel over the distance @xmath74 between the injecting mot and the guide .",
    "this heating is larger if the atoms spend more time in this region , _",
    "i.e. _ if they are slow",
    ". the presence of the auxiliary mot causes some additional heating of the atomic beam , proportional to the time spent by the atoms in the laser beams . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the increase of the longitudinal temperature of the beam is at most @xmath91% , while , as we shall see , the transverse temperature decreases by an order of magnitude , thanks to the auxiliary mot .",
    "when the injecting mot is operated in continuous mode , we found much larger longitudinal temperatures , in the range of 0.51  mk .",
    "we think that this is due to the acceleration and heating of the atoms when they travel between the injecting mot and the guide , the heating being much more dramatic than in the pulsed mode , since the frequencies of the trapping beams are closer to resonance .",
    "we have measured the transverse temperature in the guide in two ways , which give consistent results .",
    "first , we have scanned transversally the position of the probe laser beam and reconstructed the transverse profile of the atomic beam .",
    "alternatively , we have used radio - frequency evaporation to selectively remove a fraction of the atomic distribution . from the variation of the fraction of remaining atoms as a function of the radio - frequency",
    ", we infer the transverse temperature of the atomic beam ( see appendix ) .    using the auxiliary mot",
    ", we find a temperature ranging from 100 @xmath88k to @xmath92k .",
    "we have obtained similar results for the continuous and pulsed regimes .",
    "the variation of the transverse temperature with the magnetic gradient @xmath93 and the longitudinal velocity is in good agreement with the estimate ( [ temperature ] ) , where @xmath74 should be replaced by the distance @xmath94  mm between the exit of the auxiliary mot and the entrance of the magnetic guide .    in absence of the auxiliary mot , we have measured much larger transverse temperatures inside the guide , in the range of 1 - 2  mk .",
    "this is a consequence of the increase of the beam s transverse size at the magnetic guide entrance , after free propagation over the distance @xmath74 .",
    "the variation of the transverse temperature with @xmath93 and @xmath19 is also in good agreement with the prediction ( [ temperature ] ) .",
    "the flux of atoms in the magnetic guide is not significantly modified by the presence of the auxiliary mot .",
    "operating in continuous mode at a pressure @xmath95  mbar , we find that this flux varies between @xmath96 and @xmath97  atoms / s , when @xmath19 varies between @xmath98  m / s and @xmath99  m / s .",
    "this corresponds to a transfer efficiency between 15% and 30% .",
    "similar values are achieved in pulsed mode if we optimize the loading time @xmath68 according to ( [ optimumflux ] ) .    for velocities smaller than 1.5",
    "m / s , we did not find that a significant fraction of the atoms emitted by the injecting mot could be transferred to the magnetic guide .",
    "we attribute this fact to the depletion of the slow atomic beam by collisions with atoms from the rubidium vapor in the cell .",
    "the slow atoms have to travel over a distance @xmath100  cm through the cell and the tube ensuring the differential pumping , before they arrive in the ultra - high vacuum region of the magnetic guide . for @xmath95  mbar ( i.e. a total rubidium pressure @xmath101  mbar ) and @xmath102  m / s",
    ", we estimate the atomic flux to be reduced by 40  % over this distance .",
    "this limitation should be overcome with our new apparatus ( setup b ) as discussed at the end of ",
    "[ sec : injector ] .      at low atomic velocities ,",
    "the auxiliary mot does not provide efficient coupling of atoms into the guide due to strong recoil heating in the longitudinal direction .",
    "for this reason , we have developed a miniature magnetic guide ( mmg ) on a conical supporting structure .",
    "the shape has been chosen in order to keep a good optical access for the injecting mot s beams .",
    "the mmg is added at the entrance of the magnetic guide as depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) .",
    "the mmg generates a two - dimensional magnetic quadrupole field by means of four elliptical kapton - coated copper wires with a 1 mm@xmath103 cross section .",
    "the wires are placed at coordinates @xmath104 , with @xmath105 mm .",
    "they provide a transverse confinement over a distance of 40 mm up to a point at which the confining force of the long magnetic guide has risen to its asymptotic value .",
    "the inner supporting structure of the wires is a tube with a diameter @xmath106 mm , which also ensures differential pumping between the injecting mot s chamber and the section of magnetic guide .",
    "the recombination of the current between the wires of the mmg is done in a way as to minimize the free flight distance .",
    "consequently , the transverse free expansion remains small .",
    "the longitudinal temperature is not affected in this case since no spontaneous emission processes occur .",
    "the wires emerge from the supporting structure before being folded back outwards and attached to the conical structure .",
    "the currents recombine in the metallic supporting structure to which the non - isolated wire ends are screwed ( see fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) ) . in this way",
    "the laser beams of the injecting mot are not interrupted by the mmg s wires .",
    "the mmg allows to reduce the distance over which the atoms expand freely to less than 3 mm .",
    "the magnetic gradient is typically 1 t / m ( 0.22 t m@xmath107a@xmath107 ) .",
    "the current running in the mmg has to be chosen in the same sense as the one in the guide .",
    "the wires of the mmg are kept cooled by thermal contact with the water - cooled magnetic guide . with a current of 5 a running through the wires of the mmg",
    ", we find an increase of resistivity that corresponds to a temperature rise of 5 k assuming an homogeneous temperature change of the wires .    in order to measure the mean velocity of the atoms along the longitudinal axis , we use as before a time - of - flight technique .",
    "we operate the injecting mot in a pulsed mode . at time @xmath108 , we launch a bunch of atoms which propagates in the magnetic guide , and we monitor the time - dependent absorption signal of a probe beam located further downstream .",
    "the mmg allows for the production of a very low velocity beam in the magnetic guide .",
    "we have recently observed atoms in the magnetic guide with a mean velocity of the order of 70 cm / s . for the production of such a low - velocity atomic beam ,",
    "two requirements have to be met .",
    "the injecting mot s beam profiles have to be balanced over the whole free - flight distance ( otherwise the atoms are accelerated while passing through the wings of the laser beams ) . furthermore , care has to be taken that the atoms are not pumped out of the @xmath109 level by stray light while propagating in the magnetic guide . for that purpose ,",
    "we detune the frequency of the repumping light by several line widths .",
    "actually , we do not detect any atoms in the guide when the repumping laser is on resonance .    in conclusion",
    ", we have reported the continuous and pulsed loading of a slow and cold atomic beam into a magnetic guide . in order to optimize the transfer into the guide",
    ", we have investigated various coupling schemes . the first one is based on an auxiliary two - dimensional mot that confines the atoms transversally before they enter the guide . however , for low atomic velocities , the atoms are strongly heated in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this limitation does not occur in another coupling method which relies on magnetic confinement in the transfer zone .",
    "for this purpose , we have constructed a miniature magnetic guide located between the injecting mot and the long magnetic guide .",
    "the latter scheme allows to inject atoms with velocities down to 70 cm / s into the guide , a result which we hope to further improve in future experiments .",

    "the appendix is devoted to the determination of the transverse temperature from the fraction of remaining atoms when a radio frequency wave is applied .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the case of a collisionless gas .",
    "the atoms propagate freely along the guide axis ( @xmath5 ) and they are confined in the transverse @xmath40 plane by an isotropic harmonic potential with frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal motions are decoupled from each other and the total hamiltonian then reads : @xmath110 where the hamiltonian for the transverse motion is : @xmath111 with @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "another dynamical quantity of interest for the study of the transverse motion is the @xmath5-component of the angular momentum @xmath114    the trajectory of an atom is characterized by three constants of motion : the velocity @xmath115 along the guide axis , the total ( kinetic+potential ) transverse energy @xmath116 , and the @xmath5-component of the angular momentum @xmath117 .",
    "one readily establishes a relation between the two quantities @xmath118 and @xmath73 characterizing the transverse motion : @xmath119 . for a given @xmath120",
    ", the trajectory is confined in the region of space @xmath121 with : @xmath122    the evaporation is performed by inducing spin flips with a radiofrequency field of frequency @xmath123 on a surface defined by : @xmath124 .",
    "note that it does not mean _ a priori _ that atoms with an energy higher than @xmath125 are evaporated .",
    "it depends actually on the total energy of the particle and on its angular momentum .",
    "evaporation occurs only if @xmath126 , which means that the trajectory goes through the surface of evaporation . in the following ,",
    "we note @xmath127 .    in order to determine the fraction @xmath128 of atoms which is not affected by the evaporation",
    ", one needs to derive the density probability @xmath129 for a given atom to have an energy @xmath118 and an angular momentum @xmath73 . by definition , @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "one readily obtains @xcite : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we distinguish two categories of atoms that are not affected by the radio - frequency wave :    * atoms such that @xmath134 , the corresponding range of values for @xmath118 and @xmath73 is denoted @xmath135 ; * atoms such that @xmath136 , the corresponding range of values for @xmath118 and @xmath73 is denoted @xmath137 .",
    "the fraction @xmath128 of non - evaporated atoms is obtained after a simple calculation and it reads : @xmath138 the temperature is obtained by fitting the experimental data to the function ( a3 ) .",
    "this fraction has a minimum for @xmath139 equal to @xmath140 . without elastic collisions , it is impossible to evaporate all atoms . on the other hand ,",
    "since collisions allow the redistribution of angular momentum and energy , the observation of a fraction of non - evaporated atoms lower than @xmath141 is a signature of the presence of elastic collisions in the sample when crossing the region where evaporation is applied .",
    "we emphasize that this treatment is valid only if the magnetic potential is close to a harmonic potential : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the temperature , @xmath88 the magnetic moment and @xmath144 the longitudinal bias field applied in the evaporation region .",
    "when this criterium is not fulfilled , we have to use a numerical model based on a monte - carlo sampling of the atomic distribution rather than the analytical expression ( [ fevap ] ) .",
