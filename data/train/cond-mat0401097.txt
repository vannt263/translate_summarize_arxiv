    "the study of phase transitions is central to statistical mechanics . of primary interest",
    "is the determination of the location , the order and the strength of the transitions . while only systems of infinite extent display such phenomena , these are not directly accessible to the non - perturbative computational approach , which is restricted to a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "there are , however , well - established techniques for the extraction of information from numerical studies of finite systems , and prominent amongst them is finite - size scaling ( fss ) .",
    "the fss hypothesis is based on the premise that the only relevant scales are the correlation length of the infinite - size system and the linear extent of its finite - size counterpart @xcite . a modification , in which the correlation length of the finite system replaces its actual size , extends the validity of the hypothesis to the upper critical dimension @xcite .",
    "traditional techniques to determine phase transition strength from finite - size data involve the application of fss to thermodynamic quantities or to the lowest lying partition function zeroes @xcite .",
    "however , a full understanding of the properties of the infinite - size system requires knowledge of the density of zeroes too . while it has long been expected that extraction of this quantity from finite - size systems would be a lucrative source of information , a technique to do so proved elusive @xcite .",
    "the source of the difficulties is that it involves reconstruction of a continuous density function from a discrete data set , or sets , as the density of zeroes for a finite system is essentially a set of delta functions .",
    "recent considerations have bypassed these difficulties @xcite . rather than focusing on the density of zeroes itself , one determines the integrated density of zeroes .",
    "the robustness and efficiency of this approach was demonstrated in @xcite and the method favourably compared to other techniques in @xcite .    in these previous analyses ,",
    "the distribution of zeroes had two special properties .",
    "these are ( _ i _ ) the zeroes dominating critical or pseudocritical behaviour lie on a curve called the _ singular line _ , which impacts onto the real axis at the transition point and ( _ ii _ ) these zeroes are simple zeroes ( zeroes of order one ) . while these two properties are common to the bulk of models in statistical physics and in lattice field theory , they are by no means generic and the question of the generality of the technique presented in @xcite therefore arises .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the method presented in @xcite to deal with situations where the above two properties do not hold .",
    "instead , the method developed here in sec .",
    "2 assumes the zeroes to be distributed across a two - dimensional region in the complex plane and/or to occur in degenerate sets .",
    "such distributions of zeroes have been observed in various models of statistical physics and lattice field theory in two dimensions .",
    "the models we address in sec .  3 are ( a ) the ising model on a square lattice ( using brascamp - kunz boundary conditions ) with anisotropic couplings , ( b ) the ising model on a bathroom - tile lattice , and ( c ) the case of free wilson fermions in two dimensions .",
    "while all of these models are in the same two - dimensional ising universality class , their detailed distributions of zeroes are quite different and provide a sufficiently wide sample to test the improved density - of - zeroes approach to the detection and characterization of phase transitions . finally , sec .",
    "4 contains our conclusions .",
    "all of the information on a thermodynamical system in equilibrium is encoded in the zeroes of the appropriate partition function .",
    "indeed , for a system of finite size , when the partition function , @xmath0 , can be written in as a polynomial in an appropriate function , @xmath1 , of temperature , field or of a coupling parameter , we may write @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the linear extent of the system , @xmath4 labels the zeroes , and @xmath5 is a smooth non - vanishing function which plays no crucial role in the sequel and is henceforth discarded .    in numerical approaches to critical phenomena ,",
    "fss of the zeroes , @xmath6 ( with @xmath4 fixed  typically to @xmath7 , which labels the zero nearest the transition point ) , is used to determine properties of phase transitions .",
    "a summary of the status of some of these calculations is given in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , attempts have also been made to gain a deeper understanding of some more tractable models analytically @xcite .",
    "where these attempts have involved zeroes of the partition function , it is clear that much information is contained in their density .",
    "the technique developed in @xcite is essentially a convergence of these two approaches , and we summarize it here for convenience",
    ".      the reduced free energy is obtained from ( [ z ] ) as @xmath8 having discarded the regular contribution coming from @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath9 represents the volume of the system . in independent series of publications ,",
    "abe @xcite and suzuki @xcite assumed that the zeroes fall on a singular line in the complex plane , parameterized by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the transition point . in this case , a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve the correct scaling behaviour for the specific heat is that the density of zeroes along the singular line in the thermodynamic limit behave as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the usual critical exponent of the specific heat . integrating , gives the cumulative density of zeroes in the infinite - volume limit , @xmath14 in the finite - volume case , the density of zeroes is a string of delta functions , and , @xmath15 where the @xmath16 zero is given by @xmath17 .",
    "integrating this along the singular line leads to the following expression for the cumulative density of zeroes @xcite : @xmath18    the two central observations of @xcite were , firstly , that equating the infinite - volume density formula ( [ gal ] ) to its finite - volume counterpart ( [ sens ] ) is sufficient ( with hyperscaling ) to recover standard fss expressions ( indeed , fss , traditionally the consequence of a hypothesis , emerges quite naturally from this approach ) , and , secondly , that ( [ sens ] ) is a sensible definition of the cumulative density of zeroes in the finite case . with this definition , the strength of transitions may be _ directly _ measured by fitting to the ansatz @xmath19 in particular , a non - zero value of @xmath20 indicates a definite phase .",
    "when @xmath20 vanishes , a transition of first order is indicated if @xmath21 , while a value of @xmath22 larger than @xmath23 indicates a second - order transition with strength @xmath24 in @xcite and @xcite this method was tested by application to a number of models in statistical physics and in lattice field theory . in all of these models ,",
    "the locus of zeroes is one - dimensional , with a singular line impacting on the real axis at the transition point .",
    "furthermore , all zeroes for finite lattices were simple zeroes ( with no degeneracies ) .",
    "the question now arises as to how the technique translates to more general distributions of zeroes .",
    "departures from such smooth linear sets of zeroes were first observed for models on hierarchical and anisotropic two - dimensional lattices , for which there can exist a two - dimensional distribution ( area ) of zeroes @xcite . since then , a host of systems have been discovered with this feature @xcite .",
    "a common characteristic of all such two - dimensional distributions of zeroes is that the only physically relevant point at which they cross the real axis , in the thermodynamic limit , is that which corresponds to the phase transition .",
    "it is , however , possible that the zeroes cross the real or imaginary axis at unphysical points .",
    "these points may be associated with new universality classes .",
    "stephenson @xcite has shown that the density of zeroes for such two - dimensional distributions in the infinite - volume limit is @xmath25 where @xmath26 give the location of zeroes in the complex plane , with the critical point as the origin . here",
    "@xmath27 is a new type of exponent which is related to the shape of the two - dimensional distribution @xcite .    integrating out the @xmath28-dependence in ( [ 2dinfinite ] ) yields @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 mark the extremities of the distribution of zeroes at a distance @xmath32 from the @xmath28 axis in the complex plane . integrating again , to determine the cumulative density of zeroes at the point @xmath33 in the @xmath32-direction , yields @xmath34 an expression identical to ( [ gal ] ) .",
    "the strength of the transition , as measured by @xmath13 , can therefore be determined by similar methods to those previously used .",
    "however , rather than counting the zeroes along the singular line , one now counts them up to a line @xmath35 within the two - dimensional complex domain they inhabit .",
    "the second new feature we wish to accommodate is the existence of degeneracies in the set of zeroes .",
    "if a number of zeroes coincide , @xmath36 , as defined in ( [ sens ] ) , is multivalued and is no longer a proper function . a more appropriate density function is determined as follows .",
    "suppose , in general , that @xmath37 are @xmath38-fold degenerate . by a glance at fig .",
    "[ des2 ] it is easy to convince oneself that the densities to the left and right of an actual zero are given by @xmath39 the density at the @xmath38-fold degenerate zero , @xmath40 , is again sensibly defined as an average : @xmath41 this is the most general formula for extracting the density of any distribution of zeroes and deals with two - dimensional spreads and degeneracies .",
    "fitting this quantity to the form ( [ 2nd ] ) yields the strength of a second - order transition through ( [ aa2 ] ) . as in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the criteria for a good fit are good data collapse in @xmath3 ( or @xmath9 ) and @xmath4 near the transition point and @xmath20 be compatible with zero .",
