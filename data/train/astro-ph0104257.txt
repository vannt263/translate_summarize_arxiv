    "the last decade has witnessed an explosive growth of high - quality data for supernovae both from the space and ground observatories with spectacular results , and new perspectives for the use of sne  ia as cosmological yard sticks and for constraining the physics of supernovae .",
    "one of the most important new developments in observational supernova research was to establish the long - suspected correlation between the peak brightness of sne  ia and their rate of decline , @xmath1 , by means of modern ccd photometry ( phillips 1993 ) .",
    "sne  ia have provided new estimates for the value of the hubble constant ( @xmath10 ) based on a purely empirical procedure ( hamuy et al . 1996ab , riess , press & kirshner , 1996 ) , and on a comparison of detailed theoretical models with observations ( hflich & khokhlov 1996 , hereafter hk96 ; nugent et al .",
    "the values obtained are in good agreement with one another .",
    "more recently , the routine successful detection of supernovae at large redshifts , z ( e.g. perlmutter et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; riess et al . 1998",
    "; garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ) , has provided an exciting new tool to probe cosmology .",
    "this work has provided results that are consistent with a low matter density in the universe and , most intriguing of all , yielded hints for a positive cosmological constant @xmath11 of @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth noting that the differences in the maximum magnitude between @xmath11=0 and 0.7 is @xmath13 for redshifts between 0.5 to 0.8 .",
    "these results prompted the quest for the nature of the the dark energy , i.e. cosmological equation of state .",
    "current candidates include a network of topological defects such as strings , evolving scalar fields ( i.e. quintessence ) , or the classical cosmological constant .",
    "for a recent review , see ostriker & steinhardt ( 2001 ) , and perlmutter , turner & white ( 1999b ) . to separate between the candidates by sne  ia , the required accuracy has to be better than @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( albrecht & weller 2000 ) .",
    "the results on @xmath16 and future projects to measure the cosmological equation of state depend on the empirical @xmath1 which is calibrated locally .",
    "this leaves systematic effects as the main source of concern .",
    "indeed , there is already some evidence that sne ia undergo evolution .",
    "it has been argued , that the local sn  ia sample covers all the possible variations that may come from different progenitors , different explosion mechanisms and environments , etc .. for local sne ia , the observational and statistical characteristics depend on their environment .",
    "they occur less often in ellipticals than in spirals , and the mean peak brightness is dimmer in ellipticals ( branch et al .",
    "1996 ; wang , hflich & wheeler 1997 ; hamuy et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the outer part of spirals",
    "the brightness is similar to ellipticals while , in more central regions , both intrinsically brighter and dimmer sne  ia occur ( wang et al .",
    "these dependencies show us that sne ia likely depend on the underlying population and may undergo evolution .",
    "if the evolution realizes then we have to know it and take it into account going back in time .",
    "otherwise we can not _ safely _ use a local calibration . in principle",
    ", more distant sample could come from younger and more metal - poor progenitors , or the dominant explosion scenario may change .",
    "there is general agreement that sne  ia result from some process of combustion of a degenerate white dwarf ( hoyle & fowler 1960 ) . within this general picture ,",
    "three classes of models have been considered : ( 1 ) an explosion of a co - wd , with mass close to the chandrasekhar mass , which accretes mass through roche - lobe overflow from an evolved companion star ( whelan & iben 1973 ) . the explosion is then triggered by compressional heating near the wd center .",
    "( 2 ) an explosion of a rotating configuration formed from the merging of two low - mass wds , caused by the loss of angular momentum due to gravitational radiation ( webbink 1984 , iben & tutukov 1984 , paczyski 1985 ) . ( 3 ) explosion of a low mass co - wd triggered by the detonation of a helium layer ( nomoto 1980 , woosley et al .",
    "1980 , woosley & weaver 1986 ) .",
    "only the first two models appear to be viable .",
    "the third , the sub - chandrasekhar wd model , has been ruled out on the basis of predicted light curves and spectra ( hflich et al . 1996b , nugent et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "delayed detonation ( dd ) models ( khokhlov 1991 , woosley & weaver 1994 , yamaoka et al .",
    "1992 ) have been found to reproduce the optical and infrared light curves and spectra of typical sne  ia reasonably well ( hflich 1995 , hereafter h95 ; hflich , khokhlov & wheeler 1995 , hereafter hkw95 ; hk96 ; fisher et al .",
    "1998 ; nugent et al . 1997 ;",
    "wheeler et al . 1998 ; hflich et al .",
    "2000 ; lentz et al . 2001 ; gerardy et al .",
    "this model assumes that burning starts as subsonic deflagration and then turns to a supersonic , detonative mode of burning . due to the one - dimensional nature of the model ,",
    "the speed of the subsonic deflagration and the moment of the transition to a detonation are free parameters .",
    "the moment of deflagration - to - detonation transition ( ddt ) is conveniently parameterized by introducing the transition density , @xmath17 , at which ddt happens .",
    "the amount of @xmath18ni , @xmath19 , depends primarily on @xmath20 ( h95 ; hkw95 ; umeda et al .",
    "1999 ) , and to a much lesser extent on the assumed value of the deflagration speed , initial central density of the wd , and initial chemical composition ( ratio of carbon to oxygen ) .",
    "models with smaller transition density give less nickel and hence both lower peak luminosity and lower temperatures ( hkw95 , umeda et al .",
    "in dds , almost the entire wd is burned , i.e. the total production of nuclear energy is almost constant .",
    "this and the dominance of @xmath20 for the @xmath21 production are the basis of why , to first approximation , sne  ia appear to be a one - parameter family .",
    "the observed @xmath1 can be well understood as a opacity effect ( hflich et al .",
    "1996b ) , namely , as a consequence of the rapidly dropping opacity at low temperatures ( hflich , khokhlov & mller 1993 , khokhlov , mller & hflich 1993 ) . less",
    "ni means lower temperature and , consequently , reduced mean opacities because the emissivity is shifted from the uv towards longer wavelengths with less line blocking .",
    "a more rapidly decreasing photosphere causes a faster release of the stored energy and , as a consequence , steeper declining lcs with decreasing brightness .",
    "the dd models thus give a natural and physically well - motivated origin of the @xmath1 relation of sne  ia within the paradigm of thermonuclear combustion of chandrasekhar - mass co white dwarfs .",
    "nonetheless , variations of the other parameters lead to some deviation from the @xmath1 . e.g. a change of the central density results in an increased binding energy of the wd and a higher fraction of electron capture close to the center which reduce the @xmath21 production ( hflich et al .",
    "1996b ) . because dd - models allow to reproduce the observations , we use this scenario to test the influence of the underlying stellar population on the explosion .",
    "we note that detailed analyses of observed spectra and light curves indicate that mergers and deflagration models such as w7 may contribute to the supernovae population ( hflich & khokhlov 1996 , hatano et al .",
    "in particular , the classical `` deflagration '' model w7 with its structure similar to dd models has been successfully applied to reproduce optical light curves and spectra ( e.g harkness , 1987 ) .",
    "the evidence against pure deflagration models for the majority of sneia includes ir - spectra which show signs of explosive carbon burning at high expansion velocities ( e.g. wheeler et al .",
    "1998 ) and recent calculations for 3-d deflagration fronts by khokhlov ( 2001 ) which predict the presence of unburned and partial burned material down to the central regions .",
    "currently , pure deflagration models may be disfavored for the majority of sneia but , clearly , they can not be ruled out either .",
    "previously , hflich , wheeler & thielemann ( 1998 , hereafter hwt98 ) studied evolutionary effects induced by the progenitor .",
    "they calculate differences in the lc and nlte - spectra as a function of parameterized values of the integrated c / o ratio @xmath22 and metallicity of the exploding wd .",
    "this study showed that a change of @xmath22 alters the energetics of the explosion which results in an off - set of the brightness - decline relation .",
    "most prominently , this effect can be identified by a change in the fiducial rise - time to decline relation @xmath23 .",
    "the offset in @xmath1 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dispersion in the rise time of the fiducial light curve .",
    "aldering et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that @xmath23 are identical within @xmath26 for the local and distant sample lending strong support for the notion that we need a positive @xmath16 .",
    "a change in the metallicity z causes a change in the burning conditions at the outer layers of the wd and it alters the importance of the line blanketing in the blue to the uv . based on detailed calculations , effects of similar order have been found for both the delayed dd and the deflagration scenario ( hwt98 , lentz et al .",
    "recent studies showed the additional effect that z will influence the final structure of the progenitor and the resulting lcs ( umeda et al .",
    "1999 , domnguez et al .",
    "2000 , hflich et al .",
    "however , the former two studies were restricted to the progenitor evolution whereas the latter included the connection between the progenitor and the lc but it was restricted to a progenitor of @xmath27 and two metallicities , z=0.02 and 0.004",
    ".    a more comprehensive study may be useful to eliminate potential problems due to evolution of the progenitors for the determination of the cosmological equation of state , and it may provide a direct link to the progenitors of sn  ia . in this work",
    "we connect @xmath0 and and the initial metallicity of the wd to the light curves and spectral properties of sne  ia for the entire range of potential progenitors . in section 2 we discuss the evolutionary properties of our models . in section 3 ,",
    "the results are presented for the explosion , nucleosynthesis , the light curves and spectral properties . in the final ,",
    "concluding section , our model calculations are related to observations , and we discuss constraints for the progenitors and implications for the cosmological equation of state .",
    "co white dwarfs are the remnants of the evolution of low and intermediate mass stars ( becker & iben 1980 ) .",
    "their progenitors are stars less massive than @xmath28 , which is the lower stellar mass for which a degenerate carbon ignition occurs after the central helium exhaustion .",
    "the precise value of @xmath28 depends on the chemical composition ( see domnguez et al . , 1999 , for a recent evaluation of this mass limit ) .",
    "it ranges between 6.5 and 8 @xmath2 . on the base of updated theoretical stellar models of intermediate mass stars , domnguez et al ( 1999 ) found final co core masses in the range 0.55 - 1.04 @xmath2 , in good agreement with semi - empirical evaluations of the wd masses ( see e.g. weidemann 1987 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use co wd structures obtained by evolving models with main sequence masses @xmath0 between 1.5 and 7 @xmath2 and metallicities z between @xmath29 and 0.02 . in the following",

    "these models have been obtained by means of the frascati raphson - newton evolutionary code ( franec ) , which solves the full set of equations describing both the physical and chemical evolution of a star by assuming hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium and a spherical geometry ( chieffi & straniero 1989 , chieffi , limongi & straniero , 1998 ) . for a detailed description of the adopted input physics",
    "see straniero , chieffi & limongi ( 1997 ) and domnguez et al ( 1999 ) .    because we are interested in the final chemical structure of a co wd , let us recall the main properties and the major uncertainties of the evolutionary phases during which the co core forms .    in table 1",
    "we show some properties of our models . in columns",
    "1 to 9 we give : ( 1 ) the initial composition ( z and y ) , ( 2 ) the model name , ( 3 ) the main sequence mass ( in @xmath2 ) , ( 4 ) the mass of the co core at the beginning of the tp phase ( in @xmath2 ) , ( 5 ) the c abundance ( mass fraction ) at the center , ( 6 ) the mass ( in @xmath2 ) of the homogeneous carbon - depleted central region , ( 7 ) the averaged c / o ratio within the final , @xmath331.37 @xmath2 , co white dwarf after accretion , and ( 8) the @xmath18ni mass ( in in @xmath2 ) synthesized during the explosion .",
    "the c and o profiles ( mass fraction ) of the co core for selected thermally pulsing models are shown in figs .",
    "[ z22 ] to [ corate ] .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ z22 ] shows the changes induced by a different initial mass , while figs .",
    "[ m3 ] and [ m5 ] illustrate the effect of the metallicity .",
    "the internal c and o profiles of a wd are generated in three different evolutionary phases of the progenitor , namely : i ) the central he burning , ii ) shell he - burning during the early asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) phase , and iii ) shell he - burning during the thermally pulsing agb phase . as illustrated in the figures , they produce three distinct layers .",
    "the central he - burning produces the innermost homogeneous layer .",
    "this phase is initially dominated by the carbon production via the 3@xmath34 reaction occurring in the center of a convective core .",
    "once sufficient @xmath35c is synthesized , the @xmath36 reactions becomes competitive with 3@xmath34 .",
    "carbon is partially burned into @xmath37o .",
    "since the opacity of a c - o mixture is larger than that of a he mixture , the extension ( in mass ) of the convective core increases with time .",
    "when the he mass fraction in the convective core is reduced down to @xmath330.1 , the he - burning is mainly controlled by @xmath36 , and most of the oxygen in the convective core is synthesized during the late he - burning .",
    "the final abundances in the innermost region of a wd is strongly dependent on the duration of the last @xmath38 of the entire he - burning lifetime . in column 7 of table 1 , we report the size ( in solar masses ) of this innermost homogeneous region , which corresponds to the maximum extension of the convective core .",
    "the intermediate region of the final c / o structure is characterized by a rising carbon abundance .",
    "it is produced during the early - agb when the he - burning shell advances in mass until it approaches the h - rich envelope .",
    "the amount of carbon ( oxygen ) left behind increases ( decreases ) due to the progressive growth of the temperature in the shell which favors the 3@xmath34 reactions with respect to the @xmath34 capture on @xmath35c .",
    "in addition , the short lifetime does not allow a substantial conversion of carbon into oxygen .",
    "finally , a thin external layer is built up during the thermally pulsing agb . at the beginning of a thermal pulse ,",
    "the large energy flux is locally produced by the 3@xmath34 reactions .",
    "it induces the formation of a convective shell that rapidly overlaps the whole inter - shell region . owing to the large he reservoir",
    ", a huge amount of carbon is produced at the base of the convective shell .",
    "after few years ( 10 - 100 yr depending on the core mass ) the convective shell disappears and a quiescent he - burning takes place .",
    "it is during this longer phase that the @xmath36 reactions convert a certain part of the carbon produced during the pulse into oxygen .",
    "the c / o ratio left below the he - rich layer by the he burning - shell depends on the rate of the @xmath34 captures on carbon .",
    "note that the outer blip in the carbon profile is the result of the last thermal pulse where the he has not yet fully depleted .",
    "the size , in mass , of this third layer depends on the duration of the thermally pulsing agb phase .",
    "although it is influenced by the assumed mass loss rate , it is generally believed that for m@xmath393 m@xmath40 the co core can not increase more than 0.1 - 0.2 m@xmath40 during the agb .",
    "an even smaller increase of the co core is expected for larger @xmath0 .",
    "the subsequent phase has been calculated by accreting h / he rich material on the resulting co wd .",
    "note that we have assumed that the progenitor ejects its h / he - rich envelope prior to the onset of the accretion epoch .",
    "the accreted matter has a final c / o ratio of @xmath331 . when the star reaches a mass close to 1.37 m@xmath40 , ignition occurs close to the center .",
    "@xmath41 has been adjusted to enforce that the thermonuclear runaway occurs at the same central density @xmath42 in all models .      in fig .",
    "[ z22 ] , the chemical structures of our models are shown as a function of @xmath0 ( for z=0.02 ) . for low stellar masses , the core he - burning",
    "happens under lower central temperatures ( see e.g. domnguez et al .",
    "this favors the @xmath34 captures on @xmath35c , which are in competition with the 3@xmath34 resulting in a slightly smaller central c / o ratio for low @xmath0 .",
    "however , the size of the region of central he - burning , @xmath43 , is increasing with @xmath0 . in a star with 7 m@xmath40 ,",
    "the maximum size of the convective core is about 0.7 m@xmath40 while , in the 1.5 m@xmath40 model , it is only 0.25 m@xmath40 .",
    "this is the dominating factor for changes in the mean c / o ratio which , in general , produces the monotonic relation that @xmath22 decreases with increasing @xmath0 ( table 1 ) .      in figs .",
    "[ m3 ] and [ m5 ] , the chemical structures are given for various z for stars with 3 and 5 @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the sizes of the innermost homogeneous region is not a monotonic function of z. this is due to the peculiarity of very low metallicity intermediate mass stars ( see chieffi et al .",
    "2001 ) . in these stars ( z@xmath44 ) , the central hydrogen burning proceeds via the pp - chain instead of the cno - cycles , as it happen for larger metallicity .",
    "it results in a smaller he - core ( ezer & cameron 1971 , tornamb & chieffi 1986 ) . for solar metallicity ,",
    "the higher opacities and the steeper temperature gradients produce a smaller he core ( becker & iben 1979 , 1980 ) . in all cases",
    "the dependence on z of the final averaged c / o ratio ( column 7 of table 1 ) is small compared to the effect of main sequence mass .",
    "the variation with z ranges between 5 and 10@xmath45 .",
    "for the final chemical structure , the most important uncertainty is due to the ambiguity in nuclear reaction rate of @xmath36 .",
    "the innermost region is also sensitive to the treatment of turbulent convection which may affect the duration of the late central he - burning lifetime and the size of the convective core .",
    "the rate of the @xmath36 at astrophysical energies is not well established ( see e.g. buchmman 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "the cross section around the gamow peak is dominated by ground state transitions through four different processes : the e1 amplitudes due to the low - energy tail of the @xmath46 resonance at @xmath47 and to the subthreshold resonance at @xmath48 , and the e2 amplitudes due to the @xmath49 subthreshold resonance at @xmath50 and to the direct capture to the @xmath51 ground state , both with the corresponding interference terms . besides ground state transitions ,",
    "also cascades , mainly through the e2 direct capture to @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 states , have to be considered .",
    "obviously a higher rate ( @xmath56 factor of 2 ) of this reaction reduces the carbon abundance left by both the core and the shell he - burning .",
    "some indications in favor of an high value for this reaction rate comes from the rise times to maximum light in sne  ia ( hwt98 ) , and from recent studies of pulsating wds ( metcalfe , winget & charboneeau 2001 ) .",
    "concerning turbulent convective mixing , it only affects the region of the wd structure produced during the core he - burning .",
    "the two major uncertainties are related to the possible existence of breathing pulses ( see castellani et al .",
    "1985 , caputo et al . 1986 ) and the possible existence of a sizeable convective core overshoot . as recently pointed out by imbriani et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , since breathing pulses increase the late core he - burning lifetime , they significantly reduce the central c / o . in this regard",
    ", they mimic the effects of a high @xmath36 rate . on the contrary , convective core overshoot does not affect the central c / o , but it may enlarge the size of the convective core and , in turn , may produce a larger central , c - depleted region .    in the models presented in this paper , we have neglected breathing pulses and convective core overshoot .",
    "all the models , except the 3p0z13lr , have been obtained by means of a high rate for the @xmath36 reaction ( as given by caughlan et al . , 1985 ) .",
    "the 3p0z13lr model has been obtained by adopting the alternative low rate presented by caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) . a comparison between the two models with different @xmath36 reaction rate is shown in fig .",
    "[ corate ] . changing the @xmath36 rate from the high to the low value",
    "drastically alters the chemical profiles of the progenitor .",
    "the carbon abundance increases by about a factor two . at the time of the explosion , the average composition of the wd changes from oxygen - rich ( @xmath57 ) to carbon - rich ( @xmath58 ) !",
    "the consequences for the lcs are discussed below .",
    "although a variation in the assumed convective mixing scheme may change the quantitative result of our analysis , the overall conclusions and tendencies can not be significantly altered because its influence is limited to the innermost part of the pre - explosive structure .",
    "spherical dynamical explosions and corresponding light curves are calculated .",
    "we consider delayed detonation ( dd ) models , because these have been found to reproduce the optical and infrared light curves and spectra of sne  ia reasonably well ( hflich 1995b ; hkw95 ; hk96 ; nugent et al . 1997 ; wheeler et al .",

    "a significant fraction of @xmath113 photons is thermalized up to about 150 to 200 days .",
    "the actual value of thermalization depends on the expansion rate which is decreasing with mass ( see above ) .",
    "e.g. the fraction of thermalized @xmath113 photons for the models 1p5z22 , 5p0z22 and 7p0z22 are 24.2 % , 25% and 27 % , respectively .",

    "a change in the metallicity has little effects on the energetics and , consequently , on the light curves ( fig .",

    "the most important effect is the systematic decline of b - v by @xmath117 when z is changed from 0.02 to @xmath29 .",

    "a change in the line blending will cause both a change of the radius of the flux formation and the specific flux .",

    "these findings apply to all ms - masses in our sample . to some extend ,",
    "the exception are the models with @xmath118 for which the central carbon concentration varies with metallicity and produces a change in @xmath19 by 3 % and a corresponding change in @xmath109 and @xmath105 .      a low nuclear rate @xmath119 increases the explosion energy compared to our standard rate ( 3p0z13lr vs. 3p0z13 , see fig .",

    "<S> detailed stellar evolution calculations have been performed to quantify the influence of the main sequence mass @xmath0 and the metallicity z of the progenitor on the structure of the exploding wd which are thought to be the progenitors of sne  ia . in particular , we study the effects of progenitors on the brightness decline relation @xmath1 which is a corner stone for the use of sne  ia as cosmological yard - stick . both the typical @xmath0 and z can be expected to change as we go back in time . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the entire range of potential progenitors with 1.5 to 7 @xmath2 and metallicities between z=0.02 to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our study is based on the delayed detonation scenario with specific parameters which give a good account of typical light curves and spectra . </S>",
    "<S> based on the structures for the wd , detailed model calculations have been performed for the hydrodynamical explosion , nucleosynthesis and light curves .    </S>",
    "<S> the main sequence mass has been identified as the decisive factor to change the energetics of the explosion and , consequently , dominates the variations in the rise - time to decline relation of light curves . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 has little effect on the color index b - v . for similar decline rates @xmath4 , the flux at maximum brightness relative to the flux on the radioactive tail decreases systematically with @xmath0 by about @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this change goes along with a reduction of the photospheric expansion velocity @xmath6 by about 2000 km / sec . </S>",
    "<S> a change in the central density of the exploding wd has similar effects but produces the opposite dependency between the brightness to tail ratio and @xmath6 and , therefore , can be separated .    </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity alters the isotopic composition of the outer layers of the ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> selective line blanketing at short wavelengths decreases with z and changes systematically the intrinsic color index b - v by up to @xmath7 , and it alters the fluxes in the u band and the uv . </S>",
    "<S> the change in b - v is critical if extinction corrections are applied . </S>",
    "<S> the offset in the calibration of @xmath1 is not monotonic in z and , in general , remains @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use our results and recent observations to constrain the progenitors , and to discuss evolutionary effects of sne  ia with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow spread in the fiducial rise - time to decline relation in local sne  ia restricts the range of main sequence masses to a factor of 2 . the upper limit of 1 day for the difference between the local and distance sample support the need for a positive cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> the size of evolutionary effects are small ( @xmath9 ) but are absolutely critical for the reconstruction of the cosmological equation of state . </S>"
