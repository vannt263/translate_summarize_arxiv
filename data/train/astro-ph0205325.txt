    "the experiments of the upcoming generation plan to use underwater - underice cherenkov detectors  @xcite and large field - of - view atmospheric fluorescence detectors  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "one of the best evidence of cosmic neutrinos would be the detection of upstream showers / particles emerging from the earth .",
    "for this kind of events the atmospheric muon and primary charged cosmic ray background would be completely suppressed . on the other hand this signature can hardly be observed at extreme energy because the rise of weak cross sections entails the opacity of the earth with respect to neutrino propagation  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "+ the problem of muon neutrino propagation through the earth can be solved by taking properly into account neutrino - nucleon scattering inside the earth , either by monte - carlo simulation  @xcite or by approximate iterative solution of the relevant transport equation  @xcite .",
    "+ it has been recently pointed out in references @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite that the behaviour of @xmath0-neutrinos , whose existence should be guaranteed in a neutrino - oscillation scenario , should be significantly different from @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "whilst muon and electron neutrinos are practically absorbed after one charged current ( cc ) interaction , the @xmath0 lepton created by the @xmath1 cc interaction may decay in flight before losing too much energy , thereby generating a new @xmath1 with comparable energy .",
    "hence ultra high energy @xmath0-neutrinos and @xmath0 s should emerge from the earth instead of being absorbed .",
    "for a correct evaluation of the energy spectrum of @xmath1 s and @xmath0 s emerging from the earth , one has to properly take into account @xmath1 interactions as well as @xmath0 energy loss and decay .",
    "an analytical approach similar to that used in  @xcite for @xmath2 has been proposed by s. iyer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite neglecting @xmath0 energy loss .",
    "this approach holds as long as energy does not exceed @xmath4 ev because above this energy @xmath0 interaction length becomes comparable with @xmath0 decay length  @xcite .",
    "+ in reference  @xcite a detailed monte carlo calculation of @xmath5 system propagation through the earth has been performed for energy up to @xmath6  ev including the @xmath0 energy loss contribution , with special emphasis on the initial @xmath1 spectrum deformation as a function of the zenith angle of the emerging particle . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite  @xcite  @xcite the tau leptons , created by cc @xmath1 interactions inside the earth , because of their relative long decay length at high energy , could emerge from the earth surface and eventually decay inside the atmosphere ( fig .",

    "@xcite the rate of expected events in the auger detector is given on the basis of a monte carlo simulation while in reference  @xcite , and more extensively in the present work , the results of a detailed monte carlo simulation are presented in a general framework , giving the rate of emerging @xmath0 s for unit earth surface above a given minimum energy , from @xmath7  ev to @xmath8  ev and for a large variety of neutrino fluxes .",
    "the results are presented considering two different calculations of @xmath0 photonuclear cross section and comparing directly the rate of emerging @xmath0 events to the rate of extensive air showers ( eas ) produced by neutrinos interacting inside the atmosphere .",
    "deep inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering is the dominant interaction of energetic neutrinos into conventional matter .",
    "charged and neutral current differential cross sections  @xcite used for this simulation  @xcite have been calculated in the framework of qcd improved parton model .",
    "since a large contribution to cross sections comes from the very low @xmath9 region , laying beyond present accelerator domain , an extrapolation of parton distribution at very low @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is necessary .",
    "we have used the parton distribution set cteq3-dis  @xcite , available in the program library pdflib  @xcite , with nlo - dglap formalism used for the evolution with the invariant momentum transfer between the incident neutrino and outgoing lepton ( @xmath11 ) and assuming for very low @xmath9 the same functional form measured at @xmath12(@xmath13 ) . even if more sophisticated approaches for low @xmath9 extrapolation have been developed using dynamical qcd  @xcite the results for cross section calculations ( fig .",

    "+ the electromagnetic interactions of muons with matter , at the considered energies , are dominated by radiative processes rather than ionisation  @xcite . cross sections for electromagnetic radiative processes of @xmath0 are lower than muon s , yet radiative interactions remain the dominant process for @xmath0 energy loss .",
    "the cross sections used for radiative interactions of @xmath0 leptons are based on qed calculation for bremsstrahlung  @xcite and for direct pair production  @xcite while for photonuclear ( ph ) interactions references  @xcite  @xcite have been used .",
    "for all aforementioned processes we have implemented stochastic interactions for @xmath15 and a continuous energy loss approximation for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath0 energies before and after the interaction respectively .",
    "+ it is worth mentioning that bremsstrahlung cross section scales as the inverse square of lepton mass @xmath19 whereas direct pair production and photonuclear interaction cross sections approximately scale according to @xmath20  @xcite  @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the dominant processes for @xmath0 lepton energy loss are direct pair production and even more photonuclear interaction rather than bremsstrahlung photon radiation  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of cross sections in case of ph interactions has been explicitely performed by bezrukov and bugaev  @xcite only for muons while the recent calculation performed by iyer  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite includes the @xmath0 lepton .",
    "the two calculations , as far as @xmath0 lepton is concerned , differ by almost one order of magnitude at extreme energy ( fig .",

    "tau neutrinos interacting in proximity of earth s surface can produce @xmath0 s which thereafter may survive until they get into the atmosphere .",
    "the production of @xmath0 s which emerge from the earth is driven by two , not completely separated , mechanisms .",
    "the first is the propagation of neutrinos through the earth , which determines the amount and the energies of neutrinos approaching the crust just below the earth s surface .",
    "the second is the production and propagation of @xmath0 s in the crust just below the earth s surface . in the next section",
    "we will show the results of the simulation concerning the whole `` story '' of propagation of leptons , while in this section we focus the attention only on the second mechanism . here",
    "we want to evaluate the thickness of the earth s crust to be considered active for production of emerging @xmath0 s as a function of the energy of the @xmath0 neutrino as it approaches the emerging surface .",
    "hence no propagation through the whole earth is considered in this section .",
    "the results given here can be useful also for calculations of the rate of horizontal @xmath0 s emerging from mountains .    as a first approximation",
    ", the @xmath0 decay length @xmath23 can be used to estimate the _ effective depth _ , defined as the thickness of earth s crust to be considered as a source for such emerging @xmath0 s .",
    "an accurate calculation of the _ effective depth _ has to properly take into account the differential cross sections describing the neutrino interactions and tau energy loss and decay .",
    "the total neutrino cross section influences the number of produced @xmath0 s but not the _ effective depth_. we have simulated a number @xmath24 of @xmath1 cc interactions induced by vertical neutrinos and uniformly distributed along a column of earth s crust within a depth @xmath25 .",
    "one can then define the _ effective depth _ as the limit : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of emerging @xmath28 divided by the number of simulated @xmath29 interactions @xmath24 .",
    "the _ effective depth _ is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : leffsue ] where it is compared with the @xmath0 decay length with @xmath30 . at low energy , @xmath31 slowly increases with @xmath32 because the fraction of energy carried by the @xmath0 increases with energy in the cc @xmath1 interactions . above @xmath33ev",
    "the effect of @xmath0 energy loss becomes relevant and the energy degradation of @xmath0 s prevents a sizeable fraction of them from reaching the surface .",
    "consequently , @xmath31 drops and @xmath34 roughly approaches the value of @xmath0 radiation length in the outer layer of earth s crust ( @xmath35  km for the highest energies and ph in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      in this section",
    "the calculation of the fluxes of @xmath0 s emerging from the earth has been performed by means of a full simulation of @xmath5 system propagation through the earth .",
    "[ fig : nu20 ] shows the result of the simulation for an isotropic flux of @xmath1 s impinging on the earth with an energy @xmath36ev .",
    "most @xmath0 s with zenith angles larger than @xmath37 emerge with energies @xmath4ev-@xmath38ev for which , assuming ph interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 decay length becames comparable with its radiation length .    for zenith angles corresponding to a path length in the earth larger than @xmath1 interaction length in the crust ( @xmath39  km for @xmath36ev ) , neutrinos interact far away from the earth surface , and the produced @xmath0 s lose energy and decay before getting out .",
    "owing to this mechanism , the energy of the @xmath1-@xmath0 system decreases as zenith angle increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nu20 ] ) and the probability for a @xmath40 to emerge as a @xmath0 drops at large zenith angles . for @xmath1 energy",
    "lower than @xmath41ev the behaviour of the @xmath1-@xmath0 system is similar but shifted to larger values of zenith angles .",
    "the number of emerging @xmath0 s with energy larger than @xmath42 ( minimum energy ) from an earth infinitesimal surface @xmath43 can be calculated in a unidimensional approach as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the cosmic @xmath0 neutrino flux , @xmath46 is the zenith angle of the emerging particles , @xmath47 is the probability that a @xmath1 impinging on the earth surface will emerge as a @xmath0 with an energy @xmath48 . assuming a spherical shaped earth and an isotropic neutrino flux , eq .",

    "@xmath54 does not depend on neutrino fluxes or detector performance and allows a simple and straightforward calculation of the number of emerging @xmath0 s for any cosmic neutrino flux and detector sensitive area .",
    "it must be pointed out that in the definition of @xmath55 we also constrain the emerging @xmath0 to decay within an atmospheric slant depth larger than 1000  g/@xmath56 .",
    "this condition guarantees the full size formation of an eas after @xmath0 decay .",

    "@xmath57 for downwards going @xmath3 cc interactions in the atmosphere is also shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : aeff ] and  [ fig : aeffsea ] . for this kind of events ,",

    "the number of eas induced by @xmath3 cc interactions within the atmospheric mass overhanging a portion of earth surface @xmath50 is given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the atmospheric pressure ( column density ) at ground level , @xmath60 is the avogadro number , @xmath45 is the cosmic electron neutrino flux and @xmath61 is the neutrino cc cross section on isoscalar target .",
    "again , we can define an _ effective aperture _ :",

    "@xmath67 keeps increasing as long as the increase of @xmath29 cross section enhances the production of @xmath0 s in the earth . around @xmath68ev",
    "the cross section of neutrinos is so high that the probability for neutrinos to have at least one interaction inside the earth is close to one for most zenith angles and the point of first @xmath1 interaction in the earth is likely to be far from the emerging point ( this latter effect is responsible for the slow decrease of @xmath54 between @xmath69ev and @xmath6ev in fig  [ fig : aeff ] ) .",
    "moreover , the increase of @xmath0 decay length with energy prevents some of the extreme high energy events from producing a detectable shower into the atmosphere ( only @xmath0 s decaying within @xmath70  g/@xmath56 slant depth are retained ) . due to these mechanisms ,",

    "the higher value of @xmath0 energy loss ( fig  [ fig : beta ] ) gives rise to a suppression of emerging @xmath0 s for the highest energies .",
