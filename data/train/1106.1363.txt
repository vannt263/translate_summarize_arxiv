    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is an important part of the cosmological standard model , as it gave birth to the first nuclei .",
    "based on bbn models it is possible to calculate the abundances of the light elements in the universe , which can then be compared to the measured abundances .",
    "this allows to probe the universe properties at the time of nucleosynthesis , which is the most ancient period observationally accessible . in standard cosmology ,",
    "only one free parameter , the baryon - to - photon ratio at bbn time is needed to determine the abundances of the elements , and this parameter can be deduced from the observation of the cosmic microwave background @xcite . to calculate the abundances of the elements in the standard model of cosmology ,",
    "several `` semi - public '' or private codes , such as nuc123 @xcite or parthenope @xcite , already exist .",
    "we provide here a public code , ` alterbbn ` , which enables the calculation of the abundances of the elements in the standard cosmological model , as well as in alternative cosmological models such as quintessence or reheating scenarios .",
    "indeed , many different phenomena in the early universe could have modified the universe properties at the time of bbn , and in such cases the calculations could lead to abundances of the elements different from the predictions in the standard cosmological model .",
    "one of the main features of ` alterbbn ` is that it provides calculations in such cosmological models , which can enable the user to test alternative scenarios and to constrain their parameters .",
    "the code ` alterbbn ` has been inspired by nuc123 , and we use similar calculation techniques throughout the program . in the following ,",
    "we describe first the physics of big - bang nucleosynthesis , and present the set of equations in the standard model of cosmology .",
    "we then discuss alternative cosmological models , with a modified expansion rate or entropy production .",
    "we describe also the content of the ` alterbbn ` package , as well as the list of its main routines .",
    "we will then explain how to compile and use ` alterbbn ` , and the inputs and outputs of the program will be introduced . finally , some examples of results obtained with ` alterbbn ` will be given . in the appendices ,",
    "we give the list of the nuclear reactions used in ` alterbbn ` , as well as experimental limits which can be considered to constrain the calculated abundances of the elements .",
    "in the following section , we use the natural unit system @xmath0 .",
    "all the nuclear reactions implemented in ` alterbbn ` have evolution equations of the form : @xmath1 therefore , the abundance change for nuclide @xmath2 is given by @xcite : @xmath3 where the nuclide abundance is @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the mass fraction in nuclide @xmath2 and @xmath6 its atomic number .",
    "@xmath7 is the number of nuclides @xmath2 involved in the reaction , @xmath8 is the forward reaction rate and @xmath9 the reverse rate . + the expansion rate of the universe is given by the friedmann equation : @xmath10 and",
    "the equation of energy conservation can be written as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 we have @xmath14 and in absence of neutrino degeneracy : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of neutrino families .",

    "the charge conservation gives @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the avogadro number , @xmath24 and the difference between the electron and positron densities is @xmath25 from which @xmath26 can be determined using : @xmath27 the baryon energy density reads @xmath28 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the mass excess of nuclide @xmath2 , and the pressure is @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 can be determined by the equation : @xmath33 to solve the system of differential equations which gives the abundances of the elements , we assume the following initial conditions : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the unit atomic mass , @xmath36 is the number density of photons and @xmath37 the baryon - to - photon ratio . also , @xmath38 and the initial abundances of protons and neutrons are @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "the other quantities needed at this point are the initial baryon energy density @xmath41 and the time @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "+   + to solve this system of equations , a linearization of the nuclear abundance differential equations is performed , followed by a runge - kutta integration .",
    "the early universe is a relatively unknown period , and therefore the properties of the universe at that period are not well - known either .",
    "we consider in the following several alternative descriptions of the early universe properties .",
    "many phenomena at the time of bbn could have effects on the expansion rate of the universe . in such cases ,",
    "the friedmann equation is affected , and we parametrize the modification of the expansion by adding an effective dark energy density @xmath44 to the total energy of the universe .",
    "the friedmann equation then reads : @xmath45 we adopt the parametrizations described in @xcite for @xmath44 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 mev .",
    "@xmath48 is therefore the ratio of effective dark energy density over total energy density , and @xmath49 is a parameter describing the behavior of this density .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for detailed descriptions and discussions of this parametrization .",
    "the entropy content can also receive various contributions in the bbn period .",
    "we parametrize the contributions by considering an effective dark entropy density @xmath50 .",
    "the energy conservation equation reads in this case : @xmath51 we adopt two different parametrization for @xmath50 .",
    "the first one has been introduced in @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 mev and @xmath54 @xmath55 being the effective number of entropic degrees of freedom of radiation , @xmath56 the ratio of effective dark entropy density over radiation entropy density , and @xmath57 a parameter describing the behavior of this density .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for detailed descriptions and discussions of this parametrization . +   +",
    "the second parametrization is inspired by reheating scenarios in which the entropy production @xmath58 evolves like @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath47 mev .",
    "@xmath60 is the ratio of effective dark entropy production over radiation entropy production , and @xmath61 is a parameter describing the behavior of this entropy production ( @xmath62 in most reheating scenarios ) .",
    "the radiation entropy production reads : @xmath63 @xmath64 being the effective number of degrees of freedom of radiation , and where the entropy production stops at @xmath65 .",
    "the function @xmath66 is related to the entropy density by : @xmath67 where @xmath68 this parametrization is further described in @xcite .",
