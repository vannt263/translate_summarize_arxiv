    "<S> the centrality dependence of thermal parameters , characterizing the hadron multiplicities , is determined phenomenologically for lead - on - lead collisions at cern - sps for a beam energy of 158 agev . </S>",
    "<S> the strangeness equilibration factor shows a clear , approximately linear , increase with increasing centrality , while the freeze - out temperature and chemical potential remain constant . </S>",
    "<S> + _ key words : _ relativistic heavy - ion collisions , hadron yields , thermal model + _ pacs : _ 24.10.pa , 25.75.dw , 25.75.-q    it has been shown that the abundances of different hadronic species in the final state of relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be well described by statistical - thermal models ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and further references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> in such a way , the observed multiplicities of a large number of hadrons can be reproduced by a small number of parameters @xcite , such as the temperature , the baryon chemical potential , the volume , and a parameter @xcite measuring the degree of equilibration of strange particles . </S>",
    "<S> such a description can be justified for multiplicities measured over the whole phase - space , since many dynamical effects cancel out in ratios of hadron yields ; in particular , effects due to flow can be shown to disappear if the freeze - out surface is characterized by a single temperature and chemical potential @xcite .    as a matter of fact we mention that electromagnetic signals , i.e. real and virtual photons , observed in central heavy - ion collisions at cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) energies can also be described astonishingly well within the framework of a thermal fireball model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is not necessarily a proof for ( global ) thermalization @xcite , but shows that the use of thermal models allows a very economical description of a large set of observables by a few characteristic parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> it is the subject of the present paper to pursue this idea and to analyze the centrality dependence of the thermal parameters describing hadron multiplicities </S>",
    "<S> . this will provide further information about the effects of the size of the excited strongly interacting system and help in the systematic understanding of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the thermal model is able to describe the available data for various centrality classes at one beam energy .    in order to have a sound basis for the application of the thermal model we rely as much as possible on fully integrated particle multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we concentrate our efforts on the analysis of results obtained by the na49 collaboration @xcite using centrality selected fixed - target pb + pb collisions at a beam energy of 158 gev per nucleon , which are here analyzed within the framework of the thermal model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data @xcite consists of centrality binned multiplicities of the following hadronic species : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as a function of the number of participants . following @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , these centrality classes correspond to mean impact parameters ( in units of fm ) 2.2 ( bin i ) , 4.3 ( bin ii ) , 6.0 ( bin iii ) , 7.4 ( bin iv ) , 8.9 ( bin v ) , and 10.7 ( bin vi ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mean number of participants is listed in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the number of hadronic species at our disposal is quite restricted in comparison with other available data sets for central collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate here the general trend for changing centrality , relying on the data set given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that we have not included in our analysis the multiplicity of protons . at larger impact parameters many protons </S>",
    "<S> are spectators which should not be included in the thermal model analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> for completeness we briefly recall the basic features of the statistical - thermal model used to extract the chemical freeze - out parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed description can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * an ideal gas of all hadrons and hadronic resonances listed by the particle data group @xcite was used . * </S>",
    "<S> the grand - canonical ensemble description was used throughout with the additional parameter @xmath4 ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) included to account for the incomplete equilibration in the strange sector . </S>",
    "<S> * the correct quantum statistics was used for each particle . </S>",
    "<S> * resonances were described with a breit - wigner distribution @xcite over an interval [ @xmath5 - @xmath6 , @xmath5 + @xmath7 where @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> $ ] the resonance widths @xmath9 were taken from @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> all resonances were allowed to decay with branching ratios taken from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> weak decays were excluded since the data in @xcite were corrected accordingly . * no excluded - volume corrections ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) were incorporated . </S>",
    "<S> this does not affect the intensive thermal parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , etc ... ) , however , corrections to the densities will be called for , in particular the baryon and the energy densities .    according to our proposition , at chemical freeze - out the system </S>",
    "<S> is completely specified by its temperature @xmath10 , effective volume @xmath12 , strangeness suppression factor @xmath4 and chemical potentials @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the initial conditions of the collision fix @xmath13 and @xmath14 for a given @xmath11 ; @xmath13 is fixed by the requirement of strangeness conservation , while @xmath14 is determined by the constraint that the ratio of the total charge to total baryon number of the system is conserved .    </S>",
    "<S> the chi - square minimization routine minuit was used to fit the chemical freeze - out parameters using@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the branching ratio of the decay of hadron species @xmath17 into species @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes the primary density . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath4 and @xmath20 were used as free fit parameters adjusted to the fully integrated yields @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for each of the six centrality bins are listed in table  1 and displayed in figs .  1 - 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of participants , @xmath23 , is identified with the baryon number of the hadron gas .    </S>",
    "<S> as seen in table  1 , good agreement exists between the trends in the data and our model results . </S>",
    "<S> as the number of pions has a very small experimental error , the minimization routine zooms in on them and fixes the parameters so as to reproduce this number as accurately as possible . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , the number of participants , @xmath22 , has a large error and the minimization routine gives much less weight to them , hence the agreement is not as good .    </S>",
    "<S> confident that the thermal model reproduces the available hadron multiplicities in each of the centrality bins with sufficient accuracy , let us consider the trends of the thermal model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical freeze - out temperature and the chemical potential stay fairly constant for the various centralities , as seen in figs .  1 and 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the values obtained in the recent analysis of @xcite for the most central collisions shows that they are consistent with the values of the present analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the results from @xcite are shown as a band in figs .  1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> as proven in @xcite , the inclusion or omission of certain hadron species can change considerably the extracted values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress however that our analysis , due to the restricted available data , focuses on the trends with changing centrality . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature , @xmath10 , and the baryon chemical potential , @xmath11 , do not show any noticeable dependence on centrality .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two thermal parameters which exhibit a pronounced dependence on centrality : the strangeness equilibration factor @xmath4 increases approximately linearly and then saturates with increasing centrality , as shown in fig .  3 ; similarly , the radius @xmath24 of the hadron gas , which can be readily compared to the radius of a static pb nucleus increases approximately linearly with the number of participants , @xmath22 , as seen in fig  4 .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 shows the centrality dependence of various thermodynamic state variables , such as the energy per hadron @xmath25 , the energy density , the baryon density , and the entropy per baryon @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> they all remain fairly independent of the centrality . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the wroblewski factor @xcite , defined as @xmath27 increases nearly linearly with increasing centrality .    the predictions of other hadron multiplicities , such as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 can serve as a further test of the thermal model . </S>",
    "<S> these are not yet at our disposal in such a centrality binned way as the yields of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 but , may become accessible in further data analyses . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore present our prediction in table  [ predictions ] .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the thermal parameters , describing the integrated yields of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 as obtained by the na49 experiment @xcite , shows that the radius of the fireball increases linearly with increasing centrality . </S>",
    "<S> also , the strangeness parameter @xmath4 increases , i.e. , strange particle multiplicities approach chemical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the temperature and the baryon chemical potential do not change with centrality . </S>",
    "<S> no in - medium modifications are needed to describe the above quoted hadron yields . </S>"
