    "recent high - statistics runs at rhic allow the study of two - particle correlations . for au+au collisions ,",
    "the correlations augment information from jet quenching , and are a valuable tool of jet tomography .",
    "questions raised by di - hadron studies motivated programs of three - body correlation measurements to clarify the collective dynamics of nuclear collisions .    to ascertain the properties of the correlation data in heavy - ion collisions a proton - proton ( @xmath3 ) reference is needed , preferably at the same energy .",
    "correlation data in @xmath3 at @xmath4 gev have become available recently  @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to provide a physical picture of this rich data set on near and away side correlations . to interpret the data , we want to stay as close as possible to ref .",
    "@xcite with the ingredients of our calculation .",
    "we focus on pion correlations .",
    "the single - pion inclusive production cross section can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 refers to the differential jet cross section in terms of the parton transverse momentum @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the momentum fraction carried by the observed hadron .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is a parton ( jet ) distribution averaged over quarks , antiquarks , and gluons , and @xmath10 is an average fragmentation function . using @xmath11 and @xmath12 with parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16@xcite , we reproduce the measured pion spectra  @xcite for @xmath17 gev , which is satisfactory for our present analysis .    on this basis , we constructed a simple model to describe two - particle correlations within a jet and between back - to - back jets starting from a hard @xmath18 parton - parton collision . for two pions produced from the same parton ( near side correlation )",
    "the two - particle cross section can be written as @xmath19 ( and similarly for the away - side correlation , but without the @xmath20 function ) , where the momentum fractions @xmath21 and @xmath22 describe the relation between the parton and hadron momenta , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . moreover , due to fragmentation , the produced hadrons acquire a random transverse momentum component .",
    "in addition , the momentum imbalance ( @xmath25 ) between the produced partons due to intrinsic transverse momentum , gluon radiation , or any other @xmath26 process will generate a more complicated kinematic situation , where , in the case of back - to - back jets , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are already not collinear .",
    "considering hadron 1 as the trigger hadron and hadron 2 as the associated hadron , after kinematic transformations , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the azimuthal angle difference between the trigger and associated hadrons , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the proper jacobi determinants of the variable transformations .",
    "we have developed a monte - carlo based calculation to model eq .",
    "[ xdphi ] .",
    "we use gaussian distributions and uniformly distributed random angles for the fragmentation transverse momenta and the momentum imbalance @xmath25 .",
    "the widths of these distributions that best fit the data@xcite are extracted .",
    "we have calculated di - hadron correlation functions in @xmath3 collisions at @xmath0 gev at various trigger and associated transverse momenta and compared the results to available experimental data@xcite to extract the widths of the fragmentation transverse momentum distribution and the @xmath25 distribution .",
    "a sample comparison is displayed in fig .  1 , where the dashed lines indicate a fit through the data points , and the full lines represent our calculations .",
    "the associated transverse momentum is kept in the @xmath33 gev / c range , while the trigger transverse momentum is increasing from @xmath34 gev / c to @xmath35 gev / c moving down through the panels .",
    "the `` pedestal '' of    the correlation functions has been cut off .",
    "the agreement is very good , although small deviations are visible in a more magnified view .",
    "figure 2 shows the values of the widths of the fragmentation and ` intrinsic ' momentum distributions in given @xmath36 windows as functions of @xmath37 .",
    "the fragmentation width appears to be constant , @xmath38 gev / c , independent of @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath39 width shows a dependence on @xmath36 ( similarly to a simpler treatment  @xcite ) , displayed for two different data sets in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]    [ fig3 ]    the spread between the two least - square fitted curves in fig .",
    "3 is indicative of the uncertainty in our procedure .",
    "the behavior of the ` intrinsic ' transverse momentum width as a function of @xmath36 can be understood in terms of its composition@xcite .",
    "in addition to the ` true ' intrinsic transverse momentum of partons in the proton , there is a component from soft gluon radiation that can be handled via resummation , and a higher - order contribution which is expected to grow with trigger transverse momentum :    @xmath40    a measure of the ` intrinsic ' transverse momentum of partons in the proton ( in which we include the soft gluon radiation component ) can be read from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] extrapolating to @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to @xmath42 gev / c , in agreement with the value arrived at in ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit by a different argument .",
    "we have developed a constructive method for taking into account the fragmentation width and the momentum imbalance in the treatment of di - hadron correlations .",
    "the model has the flexibility to treat any @xmath25 distribution .",
    "our results have been tested against recent phenix data on di - hadron correlations in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "a value of @xmath2 gev / c is obtained for the width of the ` intrinsic ' transverse momentum distribution .",
