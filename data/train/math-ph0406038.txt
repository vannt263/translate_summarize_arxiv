    "the box - ball system is a well - known example of soliton cellular automata @xcite . here",
    "we show its simplest version . @xmath0",
    "the arrows show the time evolution process of the automaton whose precise rule will be given in the main text ( see section  [ sec:2 ] , also for the convention of the position coordinate ) .",
    "this system and its generalization to accommodate several kinds of balls are known as integrable systems by a certain limiting procedure on discrete kdv / toda equations @xcite or by explicit constructions of their conserved quantities @xcite .",
    "recently kuniba , okado , yamada and the author presented a conjecture @xcite that a set of action - angle variables for this system was given by the _ rigged configuration _ , an object known in bethe ansatz @xcite . in the simplest case a rigged configuration is a young diagram with a set of integers _ rigged _ to its rows .",
    "for instance according to the above example the associated rigged configuration evolves as @xmath1 the rows of the young diagrams are regarded as the _ action _",
    "variables and the numbers ( riggings ) associated with each row the _ angle _ variables . as one sees the former are invariant under the time evolution while the latter increase by the lengths of the associated rows . in other words",
    "the time evolution is linear in these variables .    in this paper",
    "we present a new method to construct a rigged configuration from a given state of the box - ball system . here",
    "the procedure to construct a young diagram is the same as that in @xcite but our method can extract additional data , the riggings .",
    "having the additional data our method provides a bijection between the set of automaton states and the set of rigged configurations . to borrow a name from the theory of nonlinear evolution equations",
    "@xcite we call this bijection the _ inverse scattering transform _ for the box - ball system , where we regard the rigged configuration as a set of scattering data . using the technique of the inverse scattering",
    "transform we give a proof of the assertion in @xcite that the rigged configuration is indeed playing the role of a set of action - angle variables .",
    "we observe that a certain crystallization of solvable lattice models can produce soliton cellular automata @xcite , while there is a connection between solvable lattice models and bethe ansatz in a character level @xcite . now the inverse scattering transform for the box - ball system is in some sense providing a direct connection between soliton cellular automata and bethe ansatz .",
    "the second purpose of this paper is to complete a study on this connection in the character level which was also proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us consider a particular case where the character formula comes from two different expressions for kostka polynomials @xcite .",
    "one is from the bethe ansatz @xcite and yields the fermionic character formula which is made of sums of products of @xmath2-binomial coefficients .",
    "the other is from the solvable lattice models in statistical mechanics @xcite and yields the one - dimensional configuration sums over paths ( tensor products of crystals ) . to be more specific we consider the kostka polynomial @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two integers obeying @xmath8 .",
    "then the two expressions for the kostka polynomial lead to the identity @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 means that @xmath11 is a partition of @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 will be defined in the main text ( equations ( [ eq : may28_2]),([eq : may28_3 ] ) ) , and @xmath14 ; the set of highest weight paths is defined as @xmath15 there is a decomposition @xmath16 such that if @xmath17 then the relation @xmath18 holds . therefore equation ( [ eq : may28_5 ] ) leads to @xmath19 furthermore the decomposition makes each term of the sum @xmath20 vanish separately .",
    "thus there is actually a set of refined identities behind ( [ eq : may28_5 ] ) with respect to @xmath11 . in the context of bethe ansatz",
    "this @xmath11 has a clear meaning ; it is a label for the associated eigenstate of the heisenberg magnet .",
    "however in the context of solvable lattice models its meaning is so far unclear . by identifying the space of paths for a lattice model ( the six - vertex model in ferro - magnetic regime ) with the space of states of the box - ball system",
    ", we shall find that the path associated with @xmath21 has @xmath22  solitons \" of length @xmath23 for any @xmath23 .",
    "this interpretation is based on an expression for partition functions for the box - ball system with specified soliton contents , which turns out to be the above mentioned refined identities of the fermionic formula .",
    "this expression for partition functions and its variant for including non - highest weight paths were proposed in @xcite .",
    "we derive these identities ( theorem [ prop : may26_3 ] ) as a result of the inverse scattering transform for the box - ball system .      in section  [ sec:2 ] the box - ball system",
    "is introduced and its updating rule is explained in terms of arcs . in section  [ sec:3 ] we define a mapping @xmath24 which sends any state of the box - ball system to a rigged configuration ( set of scattering data ) .",
    "the inverse map of @xmath24 ( inverse scattering transform ) is defined in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the notion of wave tails and wave fronts of automaton states is also introduced here . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we give a proof that the time evolution is linearized in the scattering data , and present an inverse scattering method for this system .    in section  [ sec:6 ]",
    "we derive formulas for the right - most wave front and the left - most wave tail of the automaton state associated with a given rigged configuration . in section  [ sec:7 ] automaton states in a finite interval",
    "are studied and the notion of highest weight states is introduced . by taking summations over these states",
    "we define partition functions for the box - ball system in section  [ sec:8 ] and establish the conjectured fermionic formulas proposed in @xcite . in section  [ sec:9 ] we prove that our inverse scattering transform is equivalent to the @xmath25 case of the bijection in @xcite .    in [ app :",
    "a ] we give a proof and an explanation of two formulas for one - dimensional configuration sums expressed by @xmath2-binomial coefficients .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional array of infinite number of boxes that extends towards both directions . as a position coordinate we put successive integers to the _ walls _ between the boxes rather than to the _ boxes _ themselves .",
    "any box is either an empty box or a filled box .",
    "the latter means that there is a ball within the box .",
    "we assume that there are at most finite number of balls in the system .",
    "the empty box is denoted by @xmath26 and the filled box is by @xmath27 .",

    "we obtain @xmath303 that is certainly equal to the above @xmath297 .",
    "let us introduce the notion of partition functions for the box - ball system with a specified soliton content @xcite . by means of the sets of automaton states ( [ eq : may27_2 ] ) , ( [ eq : may27_3 ] ) and the energy in definition [ def : may12_5 ] we define @xmath304 on the other hand we define the partition functions for the rigged configurations by using ( [ eq : may27_4 ] ) , ( [ eq : may27_5 ] ) and the energy in definition [ def : may12_4 ] as @xmath305 recall the definition of the @xmath2-binomial coefficient @xcite @xmath306 then we have that    [ lem : may28_4 ] the following relations hold , @xmath307 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are given by ( [ eq : may28_2]),([eq : may28_3 ] ) .",

    "thus we have that    [ prop : may26_3 ] the following relations hold , @xmath314    these are the identities proposed in @xcite .    by taking a sum over all the soliton contents with a fixed number @xmath315 of balls their left - hand sides yield simple expressions ( see [ app : a ] )",

    "the latter is a @xmath2-analogue of the bethe s formula @xcite . in the context of bethe ansatz",
    "the summation variable @xmath21 has meant that the associated eigenstate of the heisenberg magnet is given by a set of variables which satisfy an algebraic equation ( the bethe equation ) , where the multiplicity of the strings ( particular configurations of its roots in the complex plane ) of length @xmath23 was given by @xmath22 .",
    "thus we obtained a new interpretation of a well - known fermionic character formula ; _ the summation variable @xmath11 is representing the soliton content of a cellular automaton . _",
    "on the other hand the former formula may be new and the author expects that it can also be used in a completeness problem of bethe ansatz analysis for some quantum mechanical system .",
    "in this section we describe @xmath25 case of the bijection in @xcite in our setting and prove that it is equivalent to our inverse scattering transform .",

    "we first delete the right - most box of the shortest singular row , and then rearrange the order of the rows of the diagram so that the result is again a young diagram .",
    "we replace the rigging of the shortest singular row by a specific manner ; explicitly    1 .   if @xmath324 let @xmath325 , @xmath326 , and @xmath327 for @xmath328 .",

    "for both cases we have @xmath337 for @xmath338 . since @xmath332",
    "we see that the matrix @xmath339 is made out of @xmath340 by removing its right - most column @xmath341 . by applying @xmath123",

    "hence the @xmath324 case follows .",
    "suppose @xmath329 .",

    "from this theorem and its proof we have that    the automaton state @xmath354 is made out of @xmath250 by removing its right - most ball .",
    "this implies that our inverse scattering transform for the box - ball system coincides with the bijection in @xcite . in the @xmath25 case",
    "the latter method ( in our terminology ) determines the positions of the balls by repeating the procedure for obtaining @xmath320 from @xmath220 .",
    "we note that although their method was defined only for the highest weight states , it can be also defined for the non - highest weight states in the @xmath25 case .",

    "the first term in the right - hand side of ( [ eq : may13_2 ] ) is for those automaton states without ball in the right - most box . in the summation ,",
    "the @xmath360-th term is for those states which have their right - most empty box on the left of the wall @xmath361 .        using the identities of the @xmath2-binomial coefficients @xcite @xmath364",
    "one can deduce that the expressions in the right hand sides of ( [ eq : may14_8 ] ) and ( [ eq : may17_1 ] ) satisfy the recursion relation of the form ( [ eq : may13_2 ] ) .",
    "they also satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ eq : may13_3 ] ) and ( [ eq : may13_4 ] ) respectively .",
