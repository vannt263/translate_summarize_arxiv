    "the @xmath0-colored jones polynomial @xmath1 is a quantum invariant which is defined based on the @xmath0-dimensional irreducible representation of the quantum group @xmath2",
    ". motivated by _ volume conjecture _ raised by kashaev  @xcite , it was pointed out that the colored jones polynomial at a specific value should be related to the hyperbolic volume of knot complement  @xcite .    as another example of the knot invariant related to @xmath3 , we have the a - polynomial  @xcite .",
    "this is defined as an algebraic curve of eigenvalues of the @xmath3 representation of the boundary torus of knot , and contrary to the quantum invariants such as the colored jones polynomial it includes many geometrical informations such as the boundary slopes of the knot .",
