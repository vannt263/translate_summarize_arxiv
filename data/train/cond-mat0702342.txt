    "plutonium metal is arguably the most complex elemental solid .",
    "it exhibits a large number of allotropes , and in all the phases its pauli - like magnetic susceptibility and resistivity are an order of magnitude larger than for simple metals .",
    "the phase transitions between different phases are sometimes accompanied by very large discontinuities in volume @xcite .",
    "there is a generalized suspicion that the origin of the unique properties of pu must be connected to its unique position in the actinide series lying at the boundary between the early actinides where the f electrons are band - like and the late actinides where they are more localized and hence strongly correlated .",
    "however there is currently no consensus on the underlying electronic structure of pu and the precise mechanism underlying the anomalous behavior of plutonium and the late actinides , and several efforts in developing realistic approaches to this class of problems are currently being pursued .",
    "the traditional electronic structure techniques have been unable to account for the unusual properties of pu . if one supposes itinerant nature of the pu 5@xmath9 electrons , _ volume _ of both the low - temperature @xmath0 phase and that of the fcc high temperature @xmath10 phase can be described reasonably well @xcite .",
    "however , a significant spin polarization then results in the lsda calculations @xcite , while a number experimental investigations have led to conclusion that pu is non - magnetic ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "the strongly localized limit for the 5@xmath9 shell has been studied by means of the lda+u technique @xcite .",
    "depending on the type of the `` double - counting '' correction employed and depending on the relative strength of the multiplets and the spin orbit coupling and the strength of the local coulomb interaction between 5@xmath9 electrons one obtains either strongly magnetic @xmath11 or a non - magnetic @xmath12 configurations for the localized @xmath9 shell @xcite . in the latter case one obtains the equilibrium volume of the @xmath1-phase in good agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "that has led to conclusion that the ground state of @xmath1-pu should be essentially in the @xmath12 non - magnetic configuration , with the 5@xmath9 shell being split due to the spin - orbit coupling into the completely filled @xmath13 and empty @xmath14 states , with the local coulomb interaction @xmath15 further increasing this splitting .",
    "therefore one predicts the ground state of @xmath1-pu to be fairly similar to that of am , though with substantially smaller degree of localization of the @xmath9 electrons .",
    "similar results have been obtained recently by shick et .",
    "@xcite by means of lda+dmft using hubbard i as the impurity solver .",
    "however , in this picture one expects to have almost no @xmath9-electrons in vicinity of the fermi level , in sharp contradiction to the experimental pes @xcite , where the high peak attributed to @xmath9 states is clearly observed at the fermi level . that deficiency has been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the dynamical fluctuations around @xmath12 ground state have been added by means of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite in conjunction with the perturbative treatment of the local quantum fluctuations by the fluctuating exchange and t - matrix technique ( t - matrix flex ) @xcite .",
    "the dynamical fluctuations have not changed the @xmath9 shell occupancy , however they led to essential modification of the density of states ( dos ) , producing a peak which now is closer to ( but still separated by a finite energy from ) the fermi level , substantially improving the overall agreement between the theoretical dos and experimental pes for @xmath1-pu .",
    "another school of thought , dating back to johansson @xcite suggests that in the solid , plutonium is close to an @xmath16 configuration .",
    "these ideas were supported by the first lda+dmft computations in this material by by savrasov _",
    "_ @xcite . at the reasonable value of the coulomb interaction @xmath174",
    "ev savrasov _",
    "et al . _ have obtained a double - minima shape of the total energy versus volume curve , with positions of the minima corresponding well to the experimental equilibrium volumes of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases of pu , respectively .",
    "the minima have been assigned to the itinerant and localized state of the 5@xmath9 shell , thus the @xmath18 phase transition is due to the mott localization of the pu @xmath9 electrons .",
    "the same explanation for the @xmath18 phase transition has been put forward by katsnelson _",
    "et al . _",
    "the physical picture underlying this approach , is that the actinides provide a complex generalization of the localization - delocalization dmft phase diagram obtained in simple model hamiltonians @xcite , obtained by incorporating the realistic band structure , the realistic electronic structure of the f electrons , and most important , by relaxing the position of the atomic coordinates that were kept fixed in the model hamiltonian approach .",
    "the lda+dmft dos reported in ref .",
    "@xcite did not include realistic multiplets structure .",
    "its recent incorporation has lead to rather good agreement with the experimental pes , and in addition has shown that the fully self consistent dmft solution is non - magnetic @xcite , by allowing the possibility of ordered states .",
    "the ground state configuration of both the @xmath0 and @xmath1-pu were found to be close to the `` open - shell '' @xmath11 configuration , in the sense that the f occupation in the ground state is slightly bigger than @xmath19 .    at this point",
    "we have , within the electronic structure method + dmft framework , two rather different pictures of the ground state of pu . in the `` near @xmath20 '' of refs .",
    "@xcite one has essentially the @xmath20 `` closed - shell '' non - magnetic configuration , ( resulting from a strongly interacting one body hamiltonian obtained in lda+u ) with dynamical fluctuations reducing the f occupancy by inducing virtual fluctuations into the @xmath16 manifold , ( and all other f occupancies ) .",
    "another approach of ref .",
    "@xcite can be described as starting from an @xmath11 `` open - shell '' configuration , which is then screened by the spd conduction electrons , what results in a kondo resonance being formed at the fermi level .",
    "the one electron hamiltonian in this case is obtained from the non - magnetic weakly correlated lda .",
    "these two physical pictures are not orthogonal . in a solid",
    "the occupation is non integer , and the theory of the anderson impurity model teaches us that at non integer occupancy the ground state of the model can be adiabatically continued from _ both _ the @xmath21 and @xmath22 limits .",
    "calculations based on both physical pictures produce a ground state and density of states of @xmath1-pu in reasonable agreement to experiment .",
    "still , these two pictures are substantially different in content , and in order to chose which of two approaches ( and which one of the physical pictures ) provides the best description of the actual plutonium it is necessary to further compare their predictions for other physical quantities sensitive to the electronic structure .",
    "the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath7 is a convenient choice as it is directly linked to strength of the electronic correlations .",
    "moreover , it has been measured in both @xmath0 and @xmath1-pu , and the value of @xmath7 in the @xmath1 phase ( 43 and 64 mj k@xmath23 mol@xmath24 in @xmath1-pu , stabilized by ga and al , respectively @xcite ; in the range of 35 - 55 mj k@xmath23 mol@xmath24 in the pu@xmath25am@xmath26 alloy @xcite ) is substantially larger than in @xmath0-pu ( 17 mj k@xmath23 mol@xmath24 @xcite ) .",
    "the specific heat is a measure of the number of degrees of freedom available to the system at a given temperature .",
    "it is much larger in the case of an open shell configuration screened by spd electrons , because the degrees of freedom of the @xmath9 configuration are transferred to the low energy quasiparticle of the system .",
    "hence , in the present work we compare and analyze predictions of the two picture ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) implemented within lda+dmft regarding values the @xmath7 coefficient in the @xmath0 and @xmath1-pu .",
    "we have employed the lda+dmft technique on the basis of the full - potential linear mt - orbitals method ( fplmto ) @xcite and in conjunction with the spin - orbital t - matrix flex quantum impurity solver @xcite .",
    "the details of our technique are described in ref .",
    "we start with the lda or lda+u calculations of @xmath0 and @xmath1-pu by means of the fplmto method .",
    "the calculations of the @xmath29 @xmath30 phase were carried out at experimental lattice parameter ( @xmath314.64  , @xmath32=25 @xmath33/at ) .",
    "the complex structure of the @xmath0 phase has been mimicked by an orthorhombicaly distorted diamond structure ( which has been proved to have almost the same dos and total energy as the actual @xmath0-pu structure @xcite ) at experimental atomic volume ( @xmath313.63  , @xmath34=1.61 , @xmath35=2.09 , @xmath32=20 @xmath33/at ) .",
    "we have employed 242 and 150 @xmath36points in the irreducible brillouin zone for the cubic and orthorhombic structures , respectively . in both the lda+u and lda+dmft",
    "we have taken the values of 3 and 0.55 ev for the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath37 of the local coulomb interaction , respectively . in the lda+u calculations",
    "we have employed the `` around mean - field '' expression for the double counting term @xcite .",
    "the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath38 was obtained by lwdin orthogonalization ( using the square root of the overlap matrix ) of the converged lda or lda+u calculations .",
    "below we designate as lda+flex or lda+u+flex the cases where the lda or lda+u hamiltonian , respectively , has been employed in the lda+dmft calculations in conjunction with the spin - orbit t - matrix flex quantum impurity solver .",

    "then within the dmft scheme the local self - energy is obtained by the solution of the many - body problem for a single quantum impurity coupled to an effective electronic `` bath '' through the weiss field function @xcite @xmath46    @xmath47 denotes the ff block of @xmath48 in equation ( [ g_loc ] ) in the spin - orbit t - matrix flex quantum impurity solver the local self - energy is obtained as a sum of three contributions : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the @xmath41-matrix `` hartree '' and `` fock '' contributions , respectively , @xmath52 is the particle - hole contribution . @xmath50 and",
    "@xmath51 are obtained by substitution in the corresponding hartree and fock diagrams the bare coulomb interaction with the frequency dependent @xmath41-matrix , the latter is given by summation of the ladder diagrams in the particle - particle channel .",
    "@xmath52 is obtained by the rpa - type summation in the particle - hole channel with the bare vertex being substituted by static limit of the @xmath41-matrix @xcite .    for the double counting term in the dmft computations",
    "we have used the static limit of the self energy @xcite for the lda hamiltonian and the hartree - fork term for the lda+u hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the dmft calculations have been carried out using the 512-points matsubara frequencies corresponding to temperature 950  k. we carried out dmtf iterations until convergence in both the chemical potential @xmath42 and the local self - energy was achieved .",

    "for @xmath0-pu the separation between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states is somewhat smeared out , as has been also observed in ref .",
    "however , in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases there is still substantial density of the @xmath9-states at the fermi level @xmath61 , therefore within lda one obtains an `` open - shell '' configuration of the @xmath9-band .",
    "the lda+u calculations of @xmath1-pu lead to familiar picture @xcite of non - magnetic configuration with the filled @xmath13 and empty @xmath14 states , well separated in energy by value of @xmath15 , negligible @xmath61 and the @xmath9 shell occupancy close to 6 . in @xmath0-pu substantial broadening and intermixing of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states persist in the lda+u , retaining appreciable @xmath61 .",

    "similarly , in lda+u+flex the @xmath7 coefficient of specific heat in the @xmath1 phase is nearly two times smaller as compared to @xmath0-pu , contrary to experimental measurements , which shows @xmath7 bigger than two times and sometimes almost three times _ larger _ in @xmath1-pu .",
    "almost order of magnitude difference between experimental and theoretical @xmath7 in the case of @xmath1-pu means that in the `` closed - shell '' configuration of @xmath1-pu electronic correlations appear to be much weaker than one would expect on basis of experimental evidences .",

    "moreover , the multiplet effects in the 5@xmath9 shell should be taken into account and these are beyond our simple t - matrix flex impurity solver .    in conclusion , we have carried out comparative analysis of the specific heat and electronic structure in @xmath0 and @xmath1-plutonium by means of the lda+dmft technique in conjunction with the perturbative t - matrix and fluctuating exchange quantum impurity solver .",
    "we have shown that by assuming the `` closed '' @xmath12 configuration of the pu @xmath9 shell one can not explain high value of the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath7 in @xmath1-pu as well as substantial enhancement of @xmath7 in the @xmath1 phase as compared to @xmath0-pu , even in the case when the dynamical fluctuations are properly taken into account . at the same time , by assuming rather the `` open shell '' configuration , which is closer to @xmath11 one may obtain the observed enhancement of @xmath7 in the @xmath1 phase and actual values of @xmath7 in rather good agreement with the experiment .",
    "the experimental pes is also well reproduced by the lda+dmft dos in the `` open shell '' configuration .",
    "this suggests that the actual @xcite ground state of the @xmath9 shell in pu should be rather closer to the `` open shell '' @xmath11 configuration than @xmath12 .",

    "@xcite and in good agreement with the results of recent lda+dmft @xcite calculations , where more sophisticated solvers were used to access the strong correlation regime .",
    "the good agreement with respect to experiments achieved by our work suggest the possibility of exploring the paramagnetic state of inhomogeneous alloys and interfaces of actinides using dmft lda+flex .",
    "notice in the context that simplified solvers such as the iterated perturbation theory was very useful for the study of the paramagnetic phase of the one band hubbard model , but far worse in the description of magnetically ordered phases .",
    "for this reason we have not addressed in this paper the issue of magnetic long range order .",
    "this issue is very delicate , because as is well known in the context of the anderson impurity model , approximate perturbative treatments that signal the onset of magnetism , can indicate the need to include explicitly kondo screening rather than the occurrence of a magnetic instability .",
