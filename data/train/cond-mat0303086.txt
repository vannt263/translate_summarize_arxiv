    "there are two well - known manifestations of strong localization of classical waves in one - dimensional ( 1d ) open disordered systems : exponentially small ( with respect to the length of the system ) transmission through typical ( most probable ) random realizations , and high transparency at rare ( exponentially low - probable ) ones .",
    "the high transparency is due to the so called stochastic resonances that are accompanied by large concentration ( localization ) of energy in relatively small areas inside the system .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "that in a semi - infinite random medium the wave amplitude at the resonances can exceed ( with nonzero probability ) any given value . in the 80s",
    "this phenomenon had been studied intensively as applied to electrons , light , elastic , and acoustical waves @xcite ( see also refs . and references therein ) . in the last few years , after a long hiatus , interest in stochastic resonances in random media has rekindled in the context of random lasing @xcite , wherein resonances might play the role of effective confining cavities inducing lasing action when gain is introduced .",
    "we investigate the one - dimensional propagation of electromagnetic ( em ) waves in the strong localization regime .",
    "in particular , the occurrence of anomalously large transmission coefficients for given realizations and/or frequencies ( resonant or quasi - transparent realizations ) is studied , with emphasis on the field intensity distributions along the direction of propagation . for that purpose",
    ", we make use of both an analytical formulation and rigorous numerical simulation calculations .    we consider a single - mode waveguide with randomly rough walls .",
    "this structure , being a typical example , of a one - dimensional disordered system , has the advantage that it can be easily prepared using standard equipment ( microwave waveguides or fiber optics ) , and enables ( unlike a random stack of dielectric layers ) to directly measure the wave field inside the structure .",
    "similar multi - mode systems have been studied in recent years to investigate various localization and transport phenomena appearing in the propagation of waves through disordered media @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculations exploit the invariant embedding equation formulation for a multi - mode surface - disordered waveguide @xcite , which we have extended to account for the field inside the disordered region .",

    "actually , as shown in the inset in fig .  [ fig_alnt ] , we have observed that universality can be pushed further , so that @xmath130 [ with @xmath131 is a unique function .",
    "second , for moderate and even large @xmath2 , the rpa expression predicts very accurately the mean field distribution obtained numerically ; a monotonic decay from @xmath132 at the incoming end to @xmath133 , crossing the value @xmath134 through the middle of the disordered segment @xmath135 , and being steeper the larger is @xmath2 .",
    "third , deep into the 1d anderson localization regime , @xmath136 in fig .",
    "[ fig_aix_col ] , the numerical results reveal a departure from the rpa predictions , as evidenced by the shift of the @xmath137 crossing towards the incoming end . we have investigated the physical origin of this discrepancy by enforcing in the numerical calculations some of the assumptions made in the rpa approach .",
    "first , uncorrelated disorder has been used in the numerical calculations , with similar results to those for the gaussian correlation .",
    "rapid phase averaging has also been carried out at each realization prior to ensemble averaging , yielding no significant differences .",
    "thus neither finite correlation nor rpa can give rise to the observed discrepancy .    at this point",
    ", it is important to emphasize that plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_aix_col ] is the ensemble average of the intensity , which is a non - self - averaging ( strongly fluctuating ) quantity . to gain insight into the behavior of the field intensity pattern at different individual realizations , we have separated typical and resonant realizations according to a threshold value , @xmath1 , of the mean transmission coefficient",
    "the contribution from resonances to the mean intensity , @xmath138 , and ( rescaled ) @xmath139 , yielding transmission coefficients larger than @xmath140 , is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_aix](b ) and [ fig_aix_reso_col ] .",
    "one can see that the contribution from resonances also exhibits universal behavior in the form of a broad distribution with a relatively large maxima within the disordered segment , being determined not only by the ratio @xmath2 ( as in the case of the total average ) , but also by the the cutoff parameter @xmath1 . actually , from the comparison of the curves for @xmath139 with different @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig_aix_reso_col ] , it follows that @xmath1 fixes the position of the maximum intensity , whereas the ratio @xmath2 sets the precise value of the maxima . for fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "the maximum intensity is higher for larger @xmath141 ; namely , stronger resonances are needed for longer disorder in order to couple the same amount of energy through the system ( or similarly , to tunnel through a wider barrier ) .",
    "relaxing the definition of resonance ( lowering @xmath1 ) for fixed ratio @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_aix_reso_col ] ) , leads to asymmetrical @xmath142 distributions with maxima shifted from the center to the incoming end of the disorder segment .",
    "the contribution to the average intensity from typical realizations ( @xmath124 ) , @xmath143 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_aix](c ) , also depends universally on @xmath141 and @xmath1 ( not shown here ) , and shows a qualitative behavior similar to @xmath144 , with a faster decay , as expected . interestingly , neither @xmath144 nor @xmath145 decay exponentially , but rather manifest a @xmath0-like dependence , as mentioned above",
    "this means that , no matter how long the realization is [ i.e. , how small is @xmath146 , a lengthening of the system ( increase of @xmath57 with the localization length kept fixed ) leads , surprisingly enough , to essential changes in the energy distribution inside .",
    "namely , provided that the strength of the disorder is fixed , the longer a randomly disordered sample is , the slower is the decay of the intensity [ both @xmath144 and @xmath143 ] from the incoming end deep into the sample [ this is neatly observed in figs .",
    "[ fig_aix](a ) and  [ fig_aix](c ) ] . in other words ,",
    "the  penetration depth  of both @xmath148 and @xmath149 into a 1d random system is independent of the strength of scattering .",
    "this effect is , however , dependent on the value @xmath1 in the definition of @xmath150 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_aix_typ_col ] : with the cutoff decreasing , the slowly decaying part of @xmath145 near the incoming end ( @xmath103 ) diminishes , the distribution thus decaying more abruptly .",
    "obviously , the longer a realization is , the smaller @xmath1 is necessary for the transition to take place .",
    "interestingly , the intensity for a single typical realization for which @xmath151 appears to decay approximately exponentially @xmath152 , as seen in fig .  [ fig_aix_typ_col ]",
    "( its oscillations are smoothed spatially on a log scale ) .",
    "this is in accordance with the behavior of the average logarithm of the intensity , which fluctuates less strongly than the intensity itself and fits very accurately @xmath153 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_aix_typ_col ] ) , revealing its self - averaging nature .    finally , we have calculated higher - order moments of the mean intensity @xmath154 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_aix_n ] , the numerical results are shown in the case @xmath155 for some of the disordered waveguides considered above . the most remarkable feature is the broad , resonant - like shape , revealing the increasing ( for higher @xmath156 ) influence of ( low - probability ) resonances , with huge field intensities .",
    "to summarize , we have developed a formalism to calculate the field inside surface - disordered waveguides , similar to that of the invariant embedding equations for the reflection and transmission coefficients . by applying it to 2d single - mode waveguides with planar walls and gaussian - correlated surface roughness",
    ", we have investigated the occurrence of resonances in the 1d anderson localization regime , with emphasis on the resulting field intensity distribution both for given realizations and ensemble averages .",
    "we have examined the frequency dependence of the transmission coefficient @xmath157 for different realizations ; it exhibits well - defined resonance - type behavior inherent to the localization regime .",
    "this enables us to separate typical realizations , characterized by very low ( as expected from the average @xmath158 ) values of @xmath159 and a monotonically decaying intensity , from resonances with transmission coefficients close to one and extremely high intensity maxima ( localization ) in a region around the center of the system .",
    "numerical simulation calculations for the mean field intensity @xmath116 along the disordered segment of the waveguide reveal a universal behavior completely determined by the ratio @xmath2 : a smooth decay from the initial value of @xmath160 at the incoming end , to the outgoing mean transmitted field intensity @xmath161 , crossing the value @xmath162 at / near the center of the disordered segment . for moderately strong disorder @xmath163 , the quasi - analytical ( rpa ) prediction ( [ eq_ai_rpa ] )",
    "fully agrees with the numerical calculations .",
    "however , for strong disorder @xmath121 , the numerical results exhibit , unlike the rpa result , a shift of the mid - point ( @xmath162 ) towards the incoming edge . the contribution to @xmath116 from resonant realizations ( those yielding anomalously large transmission above a threshold value @xmath118 ) manifests also universality characterized by the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath118 : its shape is a broad distribution whose maximum value , which is larger for stronger disorder , shifts from the center towards the incoming edge with decreasing @xmath118 . on the other hand",
    ", we have found that the contribution from such low - probability resonances become more dramatic in higher - order moments of the total intensity distribution .",
    "the contribution from typical realizations to the total average , @xmath125 , depends on the cutoff value @xmath1 . for @xmath1",
    "not too small , @xmath125 ( as well as @xmath116 ) inside a 1d random system is slightly dependent on the strength of the scattering , and increases with the increase of the total length , @xmath57 , of the system . with decreasing threshold value @xmath1 , the penetration depth ceases to depend on @xmath57 and @xmath164 decays more rapidly . in this",
