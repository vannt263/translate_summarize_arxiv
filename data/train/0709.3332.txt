    "the afterglows of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) have been observed mainly in the optical and radio wavebands in the late time ( i.e. , several hours after the burst trigger ) since the late 1990 s , and they are widely explained as due to synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in relativistic collisionless shocks driven into the ambient medium of the grb sources . the synchrotron emission mechanism is supported by the detection of linear polarization at the level of @xmath8 in several optical afterglows ( for reviews , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these understandings are also being confirmed by recent observations with _ swift _ satellite , although the situation is very complicated in the x - ray band and in the early time ( for reviews , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the standard external shock model of grb afterglows ,",
    "the late - time dynamics of the shock is determined by the explosion energy @xmath9 and the ambient medium number density @xmath10 .",
    "we usually treat the fractions of the explosion energy that go into the magnetic field and electrons and the fraction of electrons that gain the energy of protons as free parameters @xmath11 and @xmath1 , respectively , since these have not been derived from the basic principles .",
    "we additionally assume that all the electrons that gain the proton energy are accelerated to form a power - law energy distribution , @xmath12 for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the lorentz factor of the shocked fluid , and a thermal component with @xmath15 is not produced .",
    "we commonly constrain the parameters @xmath16 by the observations , assuming @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that current observations can not constrain the electron - proton coupling parameter @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite showed that the observations also allow the external shock model with the parameters chosen as @xmath17 in which the fraction @xmath1 of total electrons gains the proton energy and the fraction @xmath18 is thermal electrons with @xmath19 , as long as @xmath20 .",
    "( hereafter we call the former and latter electron components  accelerated electrons \" and  thermal electrons \" , respectively . )",
    "the parameter @xmath1 gives an important constraint on the true explosion energies of grbs .",
    "it also gives a clue to unveil the physics of collisionless shocks .",
    "the thermal electrons provide additional emission and absorption for the afterglow flux only for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the characteristic synchrotron frequency of the thermal electrons .",
    "this results in the sharp decline or sharp rise of flux as @xmath22 passes the observed frequency , which can be detected through early - time radio observations , @xmath23  s for @xmath24  hz @xcite .",
    "however , such observations are difficult at present .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear whether the standard model is applicable for @xmath23  s ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the thermal electrons give the faraday effects on the afterglow polarization substantially even in the late time and that @xmath1 can be constrained through the observation of the effects",
    ". those effects may be significant ( even for @xmath25 ) if the magnetic field is ordered to some extent @xcite .",
    "the frequency below which the faraday rotation effect is significant is expected to be orders of magnitude higher than that supposed so far with @xmath4 , because the position angle rotation depends on electron lorentz factor as @xmath26 .",
    "the transfer of polarized radiation through spatially homogeneous plasma with a weakly anisotropic dielectric tensor may be described by the transfer equation of stokes parameters @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a length parameter along the ray path , and the right - handed system of coordinates with the wavevector @xmath29 along axis 3 and the magnetic field @xmath30 on plane 2 - 3 is adopted . here",
    "@xmath31 are polarization - dependent emissivity , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are the transfer coefficients related to the anti - hermitian ( hermitian ) part of the dielectric tensor , describing polarization - dependent absorption ( the polarization of the normal modes of the plasma ) .",
    "if @xmath34 , the normal modes are circularly polarized , and the transfer equation ( [ eq : transfer ] ) indicates that the conversion of @xmath35 and @xmath36 occurs .",
    "this is well - known faraday rotation . if @xmath37 , the normal modes are linearly polarized and the conversion of @xmath36 and @xmath38 occurs",
    "this is called faraday conversion .",
    "we define the optical depth @xmath39 , the rotation depth @xmath40 , and the conversion depth @xmath41 ) are as follows .",
    "first , suppose that the absorption effect is not significant , i.e. , @xmath42 . in this case",
    "the equation ( [ eq : transfer ] ) may be integrated easily @xcite . for @xmath34",
    ", we obtain the linear polarization @xmath43 and the circular polarization is given by the intrinsic one , @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , the linear polarization damps .",
    "this results from the fact that the emission from different points through the source have its polarization plane rotated at different angles .",
    "analogously , for @xmath37 and @xmath46 , the damping of @xmath47 occurs while @xmath48 remains intrinsic .",
    "secondly , in the case in which the absorption effect is significant , i.e. , @xmath49 , we may obtain the polarization degrees approximately by eliminating the differential term from equation ( [ eq : transfer ] ) .",
    "as an example , if the faraday effects are weaker than the absorption effect , i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 is obtained to the leading order .",
    "the circular polarization is similarly given by @xmath53 .",
    "in the following sections , we apply this formulation to the late - time grb afterglows . the anisotropic part of the dielectric tensor is tens of magnitude smaller than unity for the shocked plasma of a typical grb afterglow .",
    "we assume that ( 1 ) the pitch - angle distribution of electrons is isotropic for simplicity ; ( 2 ) the shocked plasma is spatially homogeneous ; ( 3 ) the shocked plasma consists of a number of random cells within each of which magnetic field is ordered . with the third assumption",
    ", we obtain the observed linear and circular polarizations by @xmath54 times those for completely ordered magnetic field , where @xmath55 is the number of the random cells in the visible region @xcite . to reproduce the optical detection at the level of @xmath8 @xcite",

    "all the characteristic frequencies @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are weakly dependent of time , so that the polarization spectrum does not evolve significantly . the suppression of @xmath47 due to absorption effect has not been pointed out in the context of grb afterglows , since @xcite erroneously used @xmath60 of opposite sign and @xcite neglected @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite discussed similar propagation effects in early - time afterglows , but their discussion should be restricted to a frequency region @xmath96 . for @xmath97 , @xmath48 and @xmath47",

    "the absorption effect of the thermal electrons is absent , and thus the absorption frequency is the same as the @xmath4 case . since @xmath122({\\tilde{\\gamma}}_m/\\gamma_m)^{-2 } ( \\ln{\\tilde{\\gamma}}_m/\\ln\\gamma_m ) \\gg 1 $ ] ( see equation ( [ eq : kappav ] ) ) and similarly @xmath123 , the faraday effects are dominated by those of the thermal electrons .",
    "the ratio @xmath124 is @xmath125 for small @xmath126 , i.e. , at the late phase of the afterglow , so that the normal modes of this plasma is circularly polarized and the faraday rotation effect is significant .",

    "are dominated by the thermal electrons , and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are satisfied .",
    "then the polarization spectrum is similar to that for @xmath142 in the @xmath4 model discussed in ",
    "it is important to note that both @xmath48 and @xmath47 are @xmath143 for @xmath88 , and they are far from detectable because the flux is suppressed in this regime ( especially for @xmath21 , the additional absorption by the thermal electrons exists ) .",
    "the existence of the thermal electrons is characterized by the suppression of the linear polarization at @xmath131 .",
    "necessary conditions for this suppression are @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the former condition reduces to @xmath146 .",

    "if we determine @xmath151 , the electron - proton coupling parameter @xmath1 can be constrained by equation ( [ eq : rotation ] ) .",
