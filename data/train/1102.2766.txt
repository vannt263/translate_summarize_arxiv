    "it is commonly accepted that the charges of the electron and of the proton have equal magnitude , and this fact is usually associated with the principles of charge conservation and of baryon and lepton conservation , as well as with the symmetry between particles and antiparticles . however , as the charge symmetry lacks a corresponding conservation law @xcite , there is no compelling requirement for its validity : it rests uniquely on experimental bases .",
    "nevertheless , and quite obviously , the structure of the elementary charges is of paramount importance for theoretical physics since 1931 , when dirac pointed out that the existence of magnetic monopoles would imply charge quantization @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness of the values of the elementary charges for both leptons and baryons implies a novel connection , beyond standard model , between the two families of particles , suggesting , for example , the existence of hypothetical lepto - quark particles which decay in both leptons and quarks @xcite .    in the last century , several measurements have been performed in order to test the symmetry of the elementary charges , using different laboratory approaches ; to this purpose , most experiments probe the neutrality of common matter . the first laboratory method used a gas flowing out of a container whose electrostatic potential could be measured @xcite .",
    "these measurements were initially spurred by einstein s suggestion that a small difference between electron and proton charges could account for the magnetic field of the earth @xcite ; it was noted also that a small deviation from the neutrality of matter could explain the expansion of the universe @xcite ; these phenomena could also be due to a nonzero neutron charge @xcite . by now , both hypotheses have been ruled out by experiment . in the beam deflection method ,",
    "the electric properties of a single species are tested : measurements are performed on molecules @xcite and neutrons @xcite .",
    "a modern version of millikan s experiment applies an electrostatic force to magnetically suspended small bodies @xcite ; this method was initially devised to detect the presence of free quarks in common matter , but it allows also to put limits on the neutrality of matter @xcite .",
    "the latest laboratory method applies an alternating electric field to a gas contained inside an acoustic cavity ; if the gas molecules carry an electric charge , a sound wave is generated .",
    "this method is an original idea by dylla and king @xcite , and is often cited as one of the best results on this topic @xcite .",
    "however , in the following we show that the results of the experiment were incorrect , as they were affected by a few errors . among the planned experiments , we want to cite the proposed use of a torsion balance @xcite , and of atom interferometry @xcite .",

    "the results of all the experiments performed so far are consistent with the usual view that matter is neutral , and have pushed further and further the limits on charge asymmetry between proton and electron and on the charge of the neutron .",
    "the results are best described in terms of two parameters @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electric charges of protons , electrons and neutrons , respectively .",

    "also the suspended body method has reached a sensitivity of the order of @xmath51 , which might be improved by a factor 10 by increasing the statistics @xcite ; gaining a larger factor relies on the possibility of using bigger bodies , which is not trivial @xcite . in order to try to improve the limits on charge asymmetry , we chose the experimental set - up of a gas filled electric capacitor used as an acoustic resonant cavity @xcite , which seemed less sensitive to systematic artefacts and at the same time most passible of upgrades .",

    "first of all , the gas is not isolated from the aluminum skin of the cavity .",
    "in fact , as mentioned before , a loudspeaker external to the cavity is able to excite the resonance modes of the gas .",
    "conversely , during p - type measurements , an accelerometer in external contact with the cavity is able to detect the vibration of the wall of the cavity and decay curves of the type of fig .",
    "[ decayline ] can even be recorded ; no such effect can be observed if @xmath127 is detuned from resonance , meaning that the coupling between the high voltage and the cavity skin is mediated by the resonating gas : the gas  skin system should then be considered a single resonating system . in the original experiment by dylla and king ,",
    "the cavity skin was a thin foil of copper , a less rigid material .",
    "a second possible source of the difference between calculation and measurement is the fact that the presence of the electric wire , to which the inner electrode is suspended , makes the electric field lines not perfectly radial ; hence the acoustic and the electric fields do not completely match .",
    "moreover , the highest values of the electric field are found near the wire .",

    "in fact , when @xmath137 and @xmath138 , a small but significant spurious signal is always present , with the right phase and an amplitude corresponding to a non - neutrality of the matter of the order of @xmath139 .",
    "this signal is not an electric pick - up , as is proved for example by detuning the excitation frequency ; moreover , it decays with the time constant of the cavity .",
    "it can have a mechanical contribution , due to waves excited by the high voltage in the skin of the cavity , an effect completely negligible as long as polarizability effects are concerned , but that can play a role in this context .",
    "a large contribution must however come from free charges in the gas .",
    "in fact , we observed an increase of the neutrality signal by irradiateing the cavity with @xmath82-rays from a radioactive source .",
    "the spurious signal reacts with hysteresis to dc high voltages applied to the inner electrode for time periods of the order of a few minutes .",
    "a typical example of this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ spurio ] .",

    "the pressure inside the resonator should then be kept as low as possible . with this finding",

    "none of these effects are reported in the 1973 paper by dylla and king .",
    "to go around the impossibility of a direct n - type measurement , we chose to use instead the intercepts in pi - type measurements taken at a base pressure @xmath140  bar of sf@xmath0 .",
    "as noted before , the intercepts represent a determination of the acoustic effect of an hypothetical charge asymmetry .",

    "the data taking procedure is as follow : the slope and intercept of the straight line have been determined several times in a period of several weeks ; each data set has about ten points with at least five different voltage values ; the points have been sampled in a non monotone sequence with a few minutes between the two of them , in order to avoid transient phenomena ; the positive and negative branches of each line have been sampled in different data sets , to keep constant the polarity of the dc voltage during each measurement .",
    "for each point the resonance frequency is tuned observing the phase of the polarization signal ; the maximum error on the tuning of the resonance frequency is less than 4  mhz ; for the 0.25  bar cavity this implies an uncertainty on the amplitude of 0.04% .",
