    "dynamics of model two - level systems in the external fields is of fundamental interest , as this problem appears in various physical systems .",
    "they are , for instance , spin 1/2 in the magnetic field @xcite , two - level atom interacting with classical field @xcite , driven artificial two - level systems in superconducting josephson devices @xcite .",
    "as well this problem is significant for physical realization of quantum gates @xcite .",
    "but still there are few time - dependent field configurations for which the problem is exactly analytically solved @xcite , so in many cases the solutions are given using perturbation theory or computed numerically @xcite .",
    "one of the physically significant fields is linearly polarized ( lp ) harmonic wave .",
    "in particular , it is used in magnetic and optical resonance experiments @xcite .",
    "there is a number of approximate approaches to this problem .",
    "in particular , when one assumes the amplitude of the oscillating field to be small in comparison with the static field along the third axis and the frequencies of these fields are near - resonant . in this case",
    "the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) is valid and one can easily get the solutions known as rabi oscillations @xcite .",
    "the understanding of magnetic resonance , meaning the resonance conditions , is based on these approximative treatment , and , for example , the resonance frequency is given by series in the amplitude ( the first correction is called bloch - siegert shift ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , not so long ago this problem was shown to be exactly analytically solvable in terms of heun functions @xcite . but as the apparatus of the latter is not developed enough , it is quite difficult to extract physical information from the solutions .    in this letter",
    "we consider the generalization of the rabi field which at different values of parameters corresponds to several physically significant situations : nonlinearly modulated rabi field , n - soliton pulse and the linearly polarized field , which approximates harmonic one .",
    "we succeed to obtain explicit analytical expressions describing dynamics of a two - level system in the proposed time - dependent field and , consequently , to get conditions of resonance in it .",
    "the emphasis should be laid on the third field configuration , as it reflects the idea to replace the cosine potential with another one resembling it with arbitrary accuracy but corresponding to the exactly solvable problem in terms of well - developed functions .",
    "the exact results we obtained coincide at small amplitude of the field and near - resonant frequencies with predictions under the rwa , while beyond it they are in agreement with numerical calculations of the problem with the linearly polarized harmonic field .",
    "the resonance conditions in the analytic form for this field , in particular , reproduce at small field amplitude the bloch - siegert shift .",
    "we consider the problem of a two - level system dynamics in the external field @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes the jacobi ( cnoidal ) elliptic function of modulus @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "let ut analyze briefly the range of physical situations given by the field @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "for the arbitrary parameters it can be understood as nonlinearly modulated rabi field , meaning the nonlinear function @xmath10 rather than constant amplitude @xmath11 in @xmath12 @xcite . in the case @xmath13 the amplitude is @xmath14 so the field is rotating with the @xmath15-soliton envelope @xcite .",
    "the third situation occurs under @xmath16 @xmath17 if the limit @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is taken , this field is exactly the linearly polarized harmonic wave .",
    "there is also an approximate limit , valid for appropriately small @xmath20 when @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . as the period of the cnoid is @xmath23 due to definition of the frequency we obtain @xmath24 $ ] as an `` effective frequency '' of the cnoidal field .",
    "therefore , finding the dynamics in the field ( [ 1 ] ) , setting @xmath3 and employing the range of small enough @xmath25 gives solution to the problem with the field @xmath26    the hamiltonian of our problem has the form : @xmath27 with @xmath28 - pauli matrices .",
