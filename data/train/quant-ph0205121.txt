    "a quantum noisy channel can be expressed with a trace - preserving completely positive map : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are density matrixes in the hilbert space @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are parameters characterizing the channel .",
    "so a single parameter quantum noisy channel can be expressed as@xmath5due to the complete positivity of the map , it can be expanded to composite quantum systems in @xmath6 .",
    "the composite channels in the expanded systems have two forms , one is@xmath7called _ mixed _ noisy channel ; the other is@xmath8called _ double _ noisy channel . here ,",
    "@xmath9are density matrixes in @xmath6 , and @xmath10 @xmath11 are the single quantum identity and noisy channel .    for a known quantum noisy channel at lest two subjects",
    "are interested .",
    "one is to determine its information capacities , the best probability to understand the input state under assumption that the action of the quantum channel is known .",
    "although the capacities of quantum noisy channels have not been solved thoroughly much effort has been put into this topic and many results are obtained @xcite .",
    "another topic , the estimation of quantum noisy channel has also been attracted much attention in last years @xcite @xcite @xcite because it is also important in quantum information theory .",
    "the estimation of quantum noisy channel is to identify a quantum noisy channel as the type of the channel is known but its quality is unknown . the quality of the channel can be characterized with some parameters . thus estimating some channel is equal to estimating its certain parameters , which may be appealed to the quantum estimation theory @xcite .",
    "quantum estimation theory is one about seeking the best strategy for estimating one or more parameters of a density operator of a quantum mechanical system . about how to estimate a quantum noisy channel",
    "we refer the readers to the refs .",
    "@xcite and recent @xcite . in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention in two aspects of the estimation of a quantum noisy channel , _ lossy channel _ ( which will be described in section ii ) . because of the anisotropy of the quantum lossy channels , different input states must have different effects for estimating the quantum noisy channel .",
    "so at first , we will discuss what _",
    "coherent states _ are optimal for estimating the single quantum lossy channel and what bases of the input states are optimal for estimating the composite lossy channels ? because entanglement has been taken a kind of resource for processing quantum information , secondly , we will discuss : can the estimation of the composite channels @xmath12 and @xmath13 be improved by using entangled input states ?",
    "this paper is constructed as follows . in section",
    "ii we shall set up a model of quantum lossy channel and explain why we choose coherent states to estimate these channels . in section iii we shall seek for the optimal input coherent states or optimal bases of input states for estimating the single and the composite lossy channels . in section",
    "iv we shall calculate the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) fisher information of output states exported from the channels @xmath11 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 and answer whether the entangled input states improve the estimation .",
    "a brief conclusion will close this paper in last section .",
    "we set the lossy channel to be estimated is described by the following physical model .",
    "a quantum system , such as photons in state @xmath1 is in a vacuum environment , the evolution of the state is a completely positive map : @xmath16 . in this model ,",
    "making use of the language of master equation we can obtain that the interaction of the in question system with its environment makes the system evolving according to @xmath17where @xmath18 is the energy decay rate .",
    "the formal solution of eq.([e4 ] ) may be written as@xmath19which leads to the solution for the initial single - mode @xmath20 @xmath21 \\left| \\alpha \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\beta \\right| = \\left\\langle \\beta \\right| \\left .",
    "\\alpha \\right\\rangle ^{t^{2}}\\left| \\alpha t\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\beta t\\right| ,   \\label{e6}\\]]where @xmath22 estimating this channel is equal to estimating the parameter @xmath23    as known , in order to estimate the channel , one , for example alice must prepare many identical initial states , input states @xmath1 and another one , for example bob must measure the output samples exported from this channel . for enhancing the detection efficiency we use coherent states to be the input states @xcite .",
    "because we do not know what coherent state is the optimal input state for the estimation in advance , we generally set this state be the superposition of coherent states @xmath24 and @xmath25 , namely , a schrdinger cat state@xmath26this state is considered one of realizable mesoscopic quantum systems yurkeetalprl1986 .",
    "zheng @xcite has shown the method for preparing this state and the measurement scheme of this state has been given in jeong01 .",
    "set @xmath27 ( in fact only if @xmath28)@xmath29 then @xmath30 thus , @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be taken into a pair orthogonal bases .",
    "setting @xmath33 @xmath34 we have@xmath35 in the time - varying bases @xmath36 ^{t},$ ] the state @xmath37 passing through the lossy channel becomes @xmath38where @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 are pauli matrixes and @xmath42 is set ( namely , we set the time of the system evolution is very short , @xmath43 @xmath44 ) .",
    "we call the map of eq.([e9 ] ) the single lossy channel .",
    "in this section we answer the first question put forward in section ii , namely , what ( coherent ) input states are optimal for estimating the single lossy channel and what bases of the ( coherent ) input states are optimal for estimating the composite lossy channels ? in the following we will firstly investigate the single lossy channel then the mixed lossy channel @xmath45 and the double lossy channel @xmath46 .    in the quantum estimation theory , in order to estimate a channel , at first , one must introduce a cost function . in general , delta function is chosen for this aim , namely,@xmath47where @xmath48 called estimators which are always a function of observing data and it describes the strategy for calculating the estimates ; @xmath49 are parameters to be estimated .",
    "it is given that the optimal estimation is to seek the povm generators @xmath50 for which@xmath51here , @xmath52where @xmath53 is the prior probability density function ( pdf ) , and @xmath54 in our problem , we shall find out a optimal input state , namely a optimal angle @xmath55 in eq.([e9 ] ) , where @xmath56 is supposed . in the following subsection",
    "a , we shall investigate what state is the optimal input state for estimating the single lossy channel . in subsection b",
    ", we shall investigate that when we use two - mode entangled state estimating the composite lossy channels ( include mixed lossy channel and double lossy channel ) , if we measure the output state separately , what bases of the input states are optimal . in subsection c , we shall look for the optimal bases of input states for estimating composite channels as we measure the output states jointly .      the schematic diagram for estimating the single lossy channel",
    "can be expressed as fig.1 ( above part).because there is no prior knowledge about the angle @xmath55 , we assign to it a uniform prior probability density function , namely@xmath57the povm generator is @xmath58and @xmath59so we have@xmath60 .",

    "the schematic diagram is shown in fig.1 ( below part ) .",
    "if the estimated channel is a mixed channel we can use possibly entangled states as their inputs . set the input state be @xmath68 , where @xmath69 . by the schmidt decomposition ,",

    "now we investigate the double lossy channel .",
    "similarly , we take the input state @xmath70 as eq.([e20 ] ) and the bases as eq.([e21 ] ) .",
    "thus , the initial state @xmath81 passing through the double lossy channel",
    "becomes@xmath96because of@xmath97and @xmath98we have@xmath99which is similar to @xmath100 .",
    "so we can obtain the similar results .      for some purposes jointly measure the output state exported from the composite channels",

    "we have obtained that the equal probability schrdinger cat states are optimal for estimating the single lossy channel and they are also the optimal bases of input states for estimating the composite lossy channels .",
    "based on the above results , in this section we shall investigate the second problem put forward in section ii , namely , can the entangled input states improve the estimation of the composite lossy channels ? to accomplish this task we may use another method , to calculate the sld fisher information of the output states of the lossy channels . at first , we briefly review this theory . given a one - parameter family @xmath110 of density operator , an estimator for parameter @xmath111",
    "is represented by a hermitian operator @xmath112 .",
    "it is shown that if the system is in the state @xmath113 then the expectation @xmath114 : = tr\\rho _ { \\varsigma } t$ ] of the estimator @xmath112 should be identical to @xmath115 and the estimator @xmath112 for the parameter @xmath111 satisfies the quantum cramr - rao inequality @xmath116 \\geqslant \\left ( j_{\\varsigma } \\right ) ^{-1},$ ] where @xmath117 : = tr\\rho _ { \\varsigma } \\left ( t-\\varsigma \\right ) ^{2}$ ] is the variance of estimator @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the quantum sld fisher information with @xmath120 the symmetric logarithmic derivative . here",
    ", the hermitian operator @xmath120 satisfies the equation@xmath121it is important to notice that the lower bound @xmath122 in the quantum cramr - rao inequality is achievable ( at lest locally ) . in other words ,",
    "the inverse of the sld fisher information gives the ultimate limit of estimation .",
    "so in our problem the bigger of the sld fisher information is , the more accurately the estimation may be fujiwara042304@xmath123 in @xcite the author has proved that the sld fisher information is convex so we only need to investigate the pure state inputs . in the following",
    "we will calculate the sld fisher information of output states for above three lossy channels .",
    "in the previous section we obtain that the equal probability schrdinger cat states are the optimal input states for estimating the single lossy channel , and they are also the optimal bases of the input states for estimating the composite channels . in the following we calculate the sld fisher information of the output state for above three lossy channels by use of optimal input states or optimal bases of the input states .    at first",
    ", we calculate the sld fisher information of single lossy channel when the input state is @xmath124 in this problem , the parameter @xmath111 in above formulas is @xmath125 in the output states of lossy channels@xmath123 from eq.(e9 ) we have@xmath126and @xmath127so we can easily calculate the sld fisher information of output state @xmath128 as @xmath129    secondly , we calculate the sld fisher information of the mixed lossy channel by using the input state @xmath130 ( see eq.([e20 ] ) ) . here",
    "@xmath131thus , we have @xmath132where @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 here , the expression of hermitian operator @xmath136 is too complex , we do not give it .",
    "fortunately , by using eq.([eq43 ] ) we can obtain a simple expression of its sld fisher information as@xmath137it is shown that the sld fisher information of mixed channel do not vary with the changing of the entanglement degree of input state , namely , it does not vary with @xmath138 changing .",
    "the sld fisher information of mixed lossy channel is accurately equal to one of one - shot single lossy channel .",
    "it means that when we take the equal probability schrdinger cat states as the bases the entangled input states the estimation of the mixed lossy channel can not be improved .",
    "thirdly , we investigate the double lossy channel . by using the input state @xmath68",
    "we have the output state as@xmath139 $ % \\end{tabular}% ,   \\label{eq45}\\]]where , @xmath140 @xmath141 by using the @xmath142 we can calculate its sld fisher information @xmath143 but the expression of @xmath144 is too complex and too long . here",
    ", we do not give it , too .",
    "we plot the @xmath144 with @xmath72 and time @xmath145 as fig.3 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 from fig.3 , we see that when we take the equal probability schrdinger cat states as the bases of the input states , the entangled inputs can not improve the estimation of the double lossy channel , too .",
    "before we end this subsection we analytically investigate two kinds of specific cases .",
    "namely , we calculate the sld fisher information of output state of double lossy channel when the input states are product state and maximally entangled state where optimal bases is still held .",
    "when the input state is a product state , namely , @xmath148 or @xmath149 , the density operator of the output state is@xmath150where `` + '' denotes a product state of @xmath149 , and `` - '' denotes a product state of @xmath148 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath151so when the input state is the product state , the sld fisher information of double lossy channel is@xmath152this result is reasonable , because @xmath148 or @xmath149 and @xmath153 is correspond to the input of product state of two - shot single lossy channel and the result eq.([eq48 ] ) is just the two times of the sld fisher information of single lossy channel .",
    "when we set @xmath154 the input state @xmath155 is the maximally entangled state and we can obtain @xmath156and @xmath157where @xmath158 @xmath159 @xmath160 and @xmath161 are uncertain matrix elements . fortunately , by using the uncertain @xmath162 we can calculate the sld fisher information as @xmath163this is the sld fisher information of channel @xmath46 when the input state is the maximally entangled state .",
    "a numerical work shows that @xmath164 is less than @xmath165 for @xmath166    in this subsection we obtained that when we take the equal probability schrdinger cat states as the bases of the input states the entangled input states can not improve the estimation of composite lossy channels .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss another case .",
    "when the input states are some non - optimal states , namely , when @xmath167 in the input states , whether the entangled inputs are better than the non entangled inputs for estimating these composite lossy channels ? in the following , we only discuss the cases of @xmath168 @xmath169 thus , in this cases the input state eq.([e20 ] ) becomes @xmath170for the mixed channel , the output state is@xmath171 .",
    "\\label{eq53}\\]]thus we can calculate the sld fisher information of @xmath172 as@xmath173here , we do not give out the sld operator for its very complex .",
    "similarly , we can obtain the output state of the double lossy channel as @xmath174 .",
    "\\label{eq55}\\]]its sld fisher information is@xmath175here , we also do not give the the sld operator for its very complex .",
    "from eqs.([eq55 ] ) , ( [ eq56 ] ) we can easily obtain that @xmath176 and @xmath177 take their maximum at @xmath178 ( see figs.4 and 5 ) , which shows that when the bases of input states are not optimal bases ( equal probability schrdinger cat states ) the entangled input states may improve the estimation of the composite lossy channels .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed two corresponding problems to estimating quantum lossy channels .",
    "firstly , we have investigated what the optimal input states is for estimating the single lossy channel and what the best bases are of the input states for estimating the composite lossy channels .",

    "that when we take the equal probability schrdinger states as the bases of the input states the entangled input states can not improve the estimation of the composite channel , however when we take the coherent states @xmath179 instead of the equal probability schrdinger cat states as the bases , the maximally entangled input states can improve the estimation of the composite lossy channels .",
