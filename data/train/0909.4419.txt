    "in the last decade , experiments have firmly established that neutrinos have small but finite masses below the ev scale @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is a puzzle why their masses are so much smaller than the charged fermions .",
    "these facts motivate physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , which can potentially manifest itself at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and/or in low - energy experiments searching for lepton - flavour - violating ( lfv ) processes @xcite .",
    "consequently , models of neutrino mass generation which can be probed at present and forthcoming experiments are of great phenomenological interest .    among the various viable models ,",
    "most need to introduce additional heavy neutrinos and/or some extremely high scale in order to naturally explain why the observed neutrinos are so much lighter than the charged fermions , a celebrated example being the type - i seesaw mechanism with heavy neutrinos of the order of the grand unification scale @xcite .",
    "alternatively , neutrinos could be massless at the tree level , but acquire a mass by radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "however , neutrinos may obtain a mass at tree level from a neutral higgs boson that acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple implementation of this mechanism of neutrino mass generation is the `` higgs triplet model '' ( htm ) in which the sm lagrangian is augmented solely by an @xmath9 triplet of scalar particles with hypercharge @xmath10 @xcite . aside from neutrino phenomenology ,",
    "a distinctive signal of the htm would be the observation of doubly charged higgs bosons ( @xmath0 ) , whose mass ( @xmath11 ) may be of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "such particles can be produced with sizeable rates at hadron colliders in the processes @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "direct searches have been carried out at the fermilab tevatron in the production channel @xmath2 and decay mode @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 ) , with mass limits of the order @xmath15  @xmath16 gev @xcite , assuming a branching ratio ( br ) of @xmath17 in a given decay channel .    in the most recent search by the d0 collaboration @xcite , three muons ( @xmath1 )",
    "were searched for in order to reduce the sm backgrounds to an acceptable level .",
    "in fact , there are six distinct @xmath4 signatures for @xmath5 or @xmath6 , and in the context of the htm the event numbers can be calculated as a function of the parameters of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we perform a quantitative analysis to see which of the six channels provides the most promising detection prospects for @xmath0 in the htm .",
    "we analyze how the pattern varies with the underlying parameters of the model .",
    "we also study the impact of the important production mechanism @xmath18 , which is omitted in the current searches , but would also contribute to the @xmath4 signatures provided that the singly charged higgs decays leptonically via @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii the htm",
    "is briefly introduced , and in section iii the current search strategy for @xmath0 at the tevatron is reviewed .",
    "numerical results are contained in section iv , with conclusions given in section v.",
    "the htm model @xcite is an extension of the sm in which only the scalar sector is augmented with a higgs triplet .",
    "the model @xcite has the following @xmath19 gauge - invariant yukawa interactions : @xmath20 where the triplet yukawa couplings @xmath21 are complex and symmetric , @xmath22 is the dirac charge conjugation operator , @xmath23 is a pauli matrix , @xmath24 is a left - handed lepton doublet , and @xmath25 is a @xmath26 representation of the @xmath10 complex triplet fields ( @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 note that the mass eigenstate @xmath0 is entirely composed of the triplet field ( @xmath29 ) , while @xmath30 is predominantly @xmath31 , with a small component of isospin doublet scalar ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "a non - zero higgs triplet vev , @xmath33 , gives rise to the following majorana mass matrix for neutrinos : @xmath34 this simple expression of tree - level masses for the observed neutrinos is essentially the main motivation for studying the htm .",
    "it provides a direct connection between @xmath35 and the neutrino mass matrix , which gives rise to phenomenological predictions for processes which depend on @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath36 for three dirac neutrinos is diagonalized by the pmns ( pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ) matrix @xmath37  @xcite , for which the standard parametrization is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the dirac phase .",
    "the ranges are chosen as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for majorana neutrinos ( which is the case in htm ) , two additional phases appear , and then the mixing matrix @xmath44 becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are referred to as the majorana phases  @xcite and @xmath48 .",
    "one has the freedom to work in the basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , and then the neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized by @xmath44 . using eq .",

    "neutrino oscillation experiments are sensitive to mass - squared differences , @xmath52(@xmath53 and @xmath54(@xmath55 ) .",
    "since the sign of @xmath54 is undetermined at present , distinct patterns for the neutrino mass hierarchy are possible .",
    "the case with @xmath56 is referred to as _ normal hierarchy _ ( nh ) where @xmath57 , and the case with @xmath58 is known as _ inverted hierarchy _ ( ih ) where @xmath59 .",

    "detailed studies of br@xmath69 have been performed in @xcite .",
    "notably , br@xmath70 ( in which the three flavours of neutrinos are summed over ) does not depend on the majorana phases , and the dominant uncertainty is from @xmath60 and the neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "importantly , br@xmath71 and br@xmath72 for a given lepton flavour is not possible in the htm .",
    "the charged scalars also induce lfv decays such as @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite , whose rates depend on the parameters of the neutrino mass matrix and the absolute values of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "direct searches for @xmath0 have been carried out at lep @xcite , the fermilab tevatron @xcite and hera @xcite .",
    "the searches in @xcite utilize the production mechanism @xmath76 , and the searches in @xcite assume production via @xmath77 .",
    "both of these production mechanisms depend on only one unknown parameter , @xmath11 , while the search strategy in @xcite depends on both @xmath11 and @xmath35",
    ". production mechanisms which depend on the triplet vev ( @xmath78 and fusion via @xmath79 @xcite ) are not competitive with @xmath77 at the energies of the tevatron , but can be the dominant source of @xmath0 at the lhc if @xmath80 ( 1 gev ) and @xmath81 gev .",
    "all searches assume the leptonic decay mode @xmath68 , for which there are six possibilities ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "for the case of br@xmath83 , the expected number of @xmath68 events scales linearly in br ( for searches for a single pair of same - sign leptons ) or quadratically in br ( for searches which require a third lepton or more ) .",
    "explicit expressions will be given below .",
    "thus , the mass limits for @xmath11 can be considerably weakened for the ( more realistic ) scenarios in which br@xmath83 .",
    "the search strategy at lep @xcite required four leptons .",
    "the cdf collaboration searched for three final states , @xmath84 , requiring at least one pair of same - sign leptons with high invariant mass @xcite .",
    "the integrated luminosity used was @xmath85 fb@xmath86 and the mass limits @xmath87 gev were obtained for the decay channels @xmath88 , respectively , assuming br=@xmath17 in a given channel .",
    "the d0 collaboration @xcite searched for @xmath89 .",
    "we note here that the main difference between these searches by d0 is the requirement @xcite of a third @xmath90 of opposite sign to the two same - sign @xmath90 , the latter assumed to originate from the decay of one of the pair - produced @xmath0 .",
    "this extra requirement suppresses backgrounds from @xmath91 and multijets , which were less than one event for the integrated luminosity of @xmath92 fb@xmath86 used in @xcite , but became non - negligible for the search in @xcite with @xmath93 fb@xmath86 .",
    "the requirement of a third lepton is necessary for the future tevatron searches in order to reduce the sm backgrounds .",
    "but such a cut means that signal events would be lost for the realistic case of br@xmath94 .",
    "all the above searches at the tevatron assume _ only _ the production mechanism @xmath95 .",
    "however , the process @xmath96 @xcite has a cross section comparable to that of @xmath2 for @xmath97 at hadron colliders , and thus the former will also contribute to the search for @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is suggested that the search potential at hadron colliders can be improved by considering the following inclusive single @xmath0 cross section ( @xmath98 ) : @xmath99 where the factor of two arises from the charge conjugate process @xmath100 .",
    "the cross section for at least one pair of same - sign leptons @xmath101 ( we focus on @xmath102 or @xmath90 , for which hadron colliders have the greatest discovery potential ) is given by : @xmath103 where @xmath104 br@xmath69 .",
