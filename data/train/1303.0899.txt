    "neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0 ) decay can be induced by the exchange of light particles such as majorana neutrinos ( long - range mechanism ) or by heavy particles ( short - range mechanism ) .",
    "the classical example of the latter is right - handed w boson and heavy neutrino exchange , which occurs in left - right symmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite . a number of other examples of such `` short - range '' contributions to @xmath0 decay have been discussed in the literature ( for a review see @xcite ) , but only very recently the general decomposition for the @xmath0 decay operator , @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 has dimension of mass ) in terms of renormalizable vertices connected by heavy virtual particles , has been given in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , several new diagrams for @xmath0 decay were identified in this work , many of which require quite exotic particles such as diquarks or colored fermions with fractional charges .",
    "common to all of the short - range contributions is that masses of order @xmath4 tev are needed for a @xmath0 decay half - life in the range of @xmath5 ys in either @xmath6ge or @xmath7xe .",
    "the very same diagrams which lead to @xmath0 decay can lead to lhc signals with like - sign dileptons plus ( at least ) two jets in the final state @xcite .",
    "the atlas @xcite and the cms @xcite collaborations have published searches for such events . ( disregarding flavor , we will refer to these events as `` @xmath8-like '' . )",
    "atlas and cms then interpret their null result in terms of the left - right symmetric model as lower limits on the mass of the right - handed gauge boson @xmath9 tev @xcite , depending on the mass of the right - handed neutrino @xmath10 and assuming the coupling @xmath11 of @xmath12 to fermions is equal to the standard model coupling @xmath13 . note that @xcite provides separate limits for opposite - sign ( os ) and same - sign ( ss ) dileptons , while cms provides only combined limits . while , of course , the search for os and ss is experimentally very similar , obviously only ss - type events are a proof for the discovery of lepton number violation ( lnv ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss how searches for lnv signals at the lhc compare with the sensitivities of current and future @xmath0 decay experiments .",
    "we do not limit ourselves to a particular model of lnv , but use a general decomposition of @xmath14 .",
    "we show that a nonobservation of @xmath8-like events in the future lhc run at @xmath15 tev would rule out all but the pure leptoquark decompositions as the dominant contribution to @xmath14 .",
    "perhaps even more interesting is that , if a positive lnv signal were found at the lhc , it is possible to identify the dominant contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss two types of observables which could provide such `` model discriminating '' power : the construction of different invariant mass combinations and the ratio of positronlike to electronlike events .",
    "we will call the latter the `` charge asymmetry '' .",
    "double beta decay can be induced by exchange of scalars or vectors with or without an accompanying virtual fermion .",
    "since the results for scalars and vectors are qualitatively very similar , we will concentrate on the scalar case only . also , there are two basic topologies of the diagrams contributing to @xmath16 decay . here , we limit ourselves to the discussion of topology i ( scalar - fermion - scalar exchange ) shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : diags ] ) . the results for topology ii ( triple - scalar exchange coupled to the trilinear vertex ) will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there are in total 18 different possible decompositions ( `` diagrams '' ) in topology i that can contribute to the @xmath0 decay operator , @xmath14 .",
    "depending on the color and @xmath17 transformation properties of the internal fermion and bosons , each decomposition can be realized in several ways , see below .",
    "twelve decompositions involve fractionally charged ( and colored ) fermions , and were discussed for the first time in @xcite .",
    "the remaining six possibilities have all been discussed before in the literature in the context of concrete models , most notably the mass mechanism or r - parity violating supersymmetry @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     -3 mm",
    "define the charge asymmetry as the ratio of the number of events @xmath18 consider first the simplest case of fig.1(a ) . with only one boson and two pairwise equal couplings ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) @xmath21 is simply determined by the ratio of production cross section for @xmath22 divided by @xmath23 .",
    "since the number of @xmath24 quarks is different from the number of @xmath25 quarks in the proton , the two cross sections are not the same and one expects to see more events with @xmath26 than @xmath27 .",
    "more generally , @xmath21 is a function of all masses and couplings , but even in the limit where couplings are equal , different @xmath0 decay decompositions have different values for @xmath21 .",
    "figure ( [ fig : casmplst ] ) shows the theoretically expected value of @xmath21 for six different cases in the equal coupling limit .",
    "these cases shown do not ( always ) directly correspond to a particular decomposition , but represent extreme limits , where the scalar identified by the color code gives the dominant contribution to @xmath21 .",
    "the case @xmath28 assumes that both diquarks have the same mass and couplings and thus is just the average of the two individual cases .",
    "if both @xmath29 and @xmath30 contribute equally to the @xmath0 decay rate ( case not shown ) , the two asymmetries average to a number close to , but not equal to the case of @xmath31 .",
    "note that the case for @xmath31 is equal to the expectations in the left - right symmetric model . in this cases ,",
    "the charge asymmetry varies only weakly from @xmath32 in the mass range shown .",
    "as the figure demonstrates , in other cases much larger ( and much smaller ) @xmath21 are possible .",
    "experimentalists should therefore provide data sets separately for positively and negatively charged leptons , in order to cover all lnv models . finally , note that for the lq case we show curves up to 6 tev , but realistically ( compare fig .",
    "( [ fig : lmts ] ) ) for lqs the lhc will not have sufficient sensitivity to find any events for lq masses larger than roughly 2 tev .",
    "we have compared the sensitivity of the lhc experiments for lnv signals with current and future sensitivities of @xmath0 decay experiments .",
    "the lhc has large discovery potential for general lnv violating models . in case",
    "a positive signal is found in the future at the lhc , we have proposed two types of observables , which allow distinguishing different lnv models : ( i ) particular sets of invariant mass peaks and ( ii ) the ratio of positron to electron same - sign dilepton events .      this work was supported by unilhc pitn - ga-2009 - 237920 and by the spanish micinn grants no , fpa2011 - 22975 and no .",
