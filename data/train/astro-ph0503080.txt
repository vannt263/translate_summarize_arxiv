    "early assessment of galaxies in the iras point - source catalog demonstrated that many active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have very distinct colors among the iras bands , especially 25 - 60@xmath6 and 60 - 100@xmath6 ( de grijp et al 1985 , 1987 , 1992 ; low et al .",
    "this meant that large samples of agn could be winnowed very effectively from the iras catalogs , to form an all - sky sample which would prove to consist mostly of seyfert galaxies .",
    "such samples , selected on infrared properties , are important in studying the importance of obscuration in seyfert galaxies , and in probing possible low - redshift evolution of ir - selected galaxies .",
    "these samples are dominated by agn which are luminous in comparison to ir emission from the surrounding galaxy , since the iras colors refer to the entire galaxy , combining the agn and surrounding galaxy at these distances .",
    "in addition to the all - sky survey , iras also observed @xmath7 fields in a slow - scan mode to deeper flux levels , in the  additional observations \" or aos .",
    "these were usually targeted around some object of particular interest , but their typical @xmath8 extent meant that a substantial region was also observed serendipitously .",
    "we report here a study of objects selected from these iras ao data , using color criteria based on the results of the earlier studies but widening the color ranges to include typical  warm \" agn at redshifts as high as @xmath0 .",
    "these fields go 37 times deeper than the point - source catalog ( depending on ecliptic latitude and number of overlapping ao observations of each field ) .",
    "such a deep sample could probe intrinsically rare objects , and span enough redshift range to detect strong evolution .",
    "since the ir detections pertain to the whole galaxies , we expected that much of the senstivity gain would result in finding similar objects to greater distance , rather than going deeper into the local agn luminosity as often happened with x - ray surveys .",
    "an initial report on the data processing and first agn identifications was presented by keel et al . ( 1988 ) .",
    "the slower - scan ao observing mode resulted in less precise positions than the all - sky survey , which combined with the fainter flux limits to make optical identifications more difficult . in many cases , slitless spectroscopy or radio emission",
    "was used to find the most probable far - ir source for optical spectroscopy .",
    "even with the broadened far - ir color criteria , we still find that half of our identifications are spectroscopically classified as agn , and some of the remainder have ambiguous emission - line classifications due to substantial reddening .",
    "we constructed initial source lists using the data holdings at leiden .",
    "each set of overlapping ao scans ( or individual scans with no overlap ) in the 1040 fields centered at galactic latitudes @xmath9 was coadded in the sky plane , extracting sources using the westerbork algorithm . in this algorithm , sources are identified based on number of pixels above a set threshold in signal - to - noise ratio ( typically @xmath10 , with fluxes evaluated by fitting a template point - spread function centered on these source positions .",
    "these source lists were filtered for transient glitches by comparison of individual scans wherever multiple observations were taken ; sources where no such confirmation was possible were flagged ( nc in table 1 ) .",
    "color selection used the fluxes extracted with a point - source template from the coadded data . in some cases",
    ", we could derive improved flux data by incorporating _",
    "scanpi _ processing of co - added survey data , where a large number of passes were available at high ecliptic latitudes .",
    "our color criteria were based on the psc agn results ( de grijp et al .",
    "1985 , 1987 ) , extended to include typical agn spectra at redshifts up to @xmath0 .",
    "expressed in spectral indices among the iras bands , they included the ranges @xmath11 $ ] or @xmath12 $ ] where spectral indices are given in the convention @xmath13 , so that f@xmath14 dropping to longer wavelengths means @xmath15 .",
    "these spectral indices are evaluated simply from the in - band fluxes with no finite - passband corrections , whose effect stretches the color space at extreme values .",
    "these ranges are designed to exclude stellar photospheres ( @xmath16 ) and as much as possible of the cold dust emission from  normal \" galaxies .    to allow for sources near the detection limit",
    ", we now accept sources with an unusually  warm \" spectral shape from either @xmath17 or @xmath18 even when there is no detection in the adjacent passband .",
    "this effort was parallel to , but independent of , the iras serendipitous survey catalog ( ssc , kleinmann et al . 1986 ) .",
    "there is substantial overlap in the objects included with both processing streams , but differences in data handling meant that some objects passed our color criteria in only one survey ; for completeness , we incorporated objects which passed our color thresholds as measured by either project .",
    "we adopted the position measured at the shortest wavelength with a significant detection .",
    "however , the iras ao positions are inherently less certain than those from the psc , for two reasons . the shorter arcs of these observations mean that the entire orbital attitude solution from stellar transits could not be used to refine the spacecraft attitude .",
    "furthermore , attempts to measure offsets for each field using bright stars detected at @xmath19 showed that sampling issues limit the accuracy of these positions to about the same level ( 3060 \" , depending on scan direction ) . after the fact , using well - established optical identifications , objects also included in the iras faint - source survey ( fss ; moshir et al .",
    "1992 ) , and radio measurements , we find that a typical error ellipse has radii of about @xmath20 arcseconds , longest in the cross - scan direction ( roughly parallel to lines of ecliptic latitude ) .",
    "this error ellipse contains about 85% of spectroscopically identified emission - line galaxies and radio - iras cross - identifications .    by convention ( keel et al .",
    "1988 ) , these sources were designated as iras - l , using truncated 1950 coordinates as in the example iras - l 08200 + 1055 , a sy 1 reported in our earlier paper .",
    "our candidate list is given in table 1 , with the iras fluxes and spectral fluxes .",
    "the origin of each source s data , leiden or serendipity survey processing , is given by the code l or s ; the appropriate source designation may be derived from this and the listed coordinates , kept at epoch 1950 in this table for consistency with the original measurements .",
    "we designate with s those sources which satisfied our search criteria in the ssc processing but not the leiden processing ; upper limits were not listed for the ssc results . because of infrared cirrus and detector flashing , useful upper limits are not uniformly available for nondetections , signified by a zero in the flux listing and omission of the spectral indices involving the affected bands . a few rich magellanic cloud fields and reflection nebulae",
    "are omitted here ; the list includes some potential stellar identifications discussed in appendix a. in addition to the new objects in table 1 , we recovered 61 known agn in this study , either radio or seyfert galaxies that were themselves the targets of the aos or other objects already found from the point - source catalog by de grijp et al .",
    "( 1987 , 1992 ) .",
    "we have attempted to remove from our sample any galaxies which were themselves the target of the ao pointing , although this took some guesswork in a few cases where early iras documentation did not record the reason for a pointing .",
    "one region in hercules was especially well - covered by multiple ao scans , affording a set of far - ir detections to unusually deep levels . as a reconnaissance of the deep far - ir content of the sky , we have examined the identifications of all the iras sources in this field regardless of colors , as described in appendix b.      optical spectra of candidates , sometimes several for a single iras source , were obtained with several instruments . in most cases , the data could be placed on a flux scale through observations of standard stars .",
    "we used the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) with intermediate - dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) in two modes , a moderate - resolution mode using the image photon - counting system ( ipcs ) as detector with realtime readout , and the higher - throughput faint - object spectrograph ( fos ) with coarser spectral sampling . with the ipcs ,",
    "the range 3200 - 7100    was sampled with 2040 pixels covering 2.0    each .",
    "the fos data cover 5000 - 10000   , with orders separated by a cross - dispersing prism .",
    "their resolution is set by sampling at 2 pixels , or 21   .",
    "most of the southern candidates were observed using the eso faint - object spectrograph and camera ( efosc ) at the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "the acquisition images from this instrument serve for the photometric and morphological properties of many of these targets .",
    "most data were taken with the  blue `` grism ( b300 , 3800 - 7000   ) . a 1.5 '' slit gave spectral resolution of 13    fwhm with spectral sampling of 6.9   .",
    "with the 3.8 m mayall telescope of kitt peak national observatory , we used the cryogenic camera grism system .",
    "a 2.5 `` slit gave resolution for a filled slit of 16    fwhm across most of the 4500 - 8000   spectral range covered by grism 770 , somewhat degraded at the ends by detector focus .",
    "for most objects , nuclear spectra have somewhat better resolution , especially important in deblending the h@xmath21 and adjacent [ n ii ] lines .",
    "six final objects were identified in 2004 using the mars enhancement of the cryogenic camera , and a 1.8 '' slit , observing the 4500 - 10300    range essentially free of focus changes .",
    "this final subset was not included in the statistics of positional offests , since they were identified with knowledge of the radio positions .",
    "observations at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) used the faint - object spectrograph , with a fixed spectral range of 4600 - 9500    in the first order .",
    "a prism cross - disperser removes potential second - order contamination .",
    "these data suffered from electronic crosstalk , manifested as a low - level additive moire pattern , which we reduced by fitting local sine waves in the fourier domain to the interference .",
    "telluric a and b bands were approximately corrected using observations of the same hot standard stars used for flux calibration .",
    "the 1.1 \" slit gave a spectral resolution limited by nyquist sampling ( 2 pixels correspond to 17.4   ) .",
    "a few objects were observed using the goldcam spectrometer at the kitt peak 2.1 m telescope .",
    "a loral 3k@xmath22 1k ccd covered the range @xmath23    with 1.25-   sampling , at a resolution of 3.8    fwhm set by the 2.0 \" slit width",
    ".    some particularly ambiguous fields were initially observed using slitless spectroscopy at the eso 3.6 m or kpno 4 m telescopes , so that emission - line objects would reveal themselves across the entire iras position box .",
    "these optical spectra give us secure identifications and redshifts for 74 of the 180 new candidates .",
    "of these , 35 ( 47% ) are clear active nuclei with sy 1 , sy 2 , or strong liner spectra .",
    "the remained include definite starbursts , some strongly reddened , and objects of ambiguous nature for which we detect h@xmath21 , [ n ii ] , and usually [ s ii ] but none of the bluer lines .",
    "many of these might be either strongly obscured agn or star - forming systems .",
    "the spectroscopic results are given in table 2 . in two cases , 09426 - 1929 and 17435 + 3141",
    ", we find multiple emission - line objects at nearly the same redshift , and assign the iras identification to the object with the strongest line emission .",
    "in many cases , we could classify the spectrum using ratios of the strong emission lines , following the precepts of baldwin , phillips , & terlevich ( 1981 ) and veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) .",
    "these classifications are given in table 2 .",
    "for cataloguing purposes , we list the optical coordinates of these objects , as obtained by centroiding around the peak from digitized sky survey dss2 red - light images .",
    "spectra of the unambiguous agn are shown in fig .",
    "1 , except for the composite emission / absorption object 1226 + 32 ( section 4.2 ) .      in support of the identification program , as well as",
    "providing fluxes and morphological information , we obtained @xmath24-band ccd images of most of the candidates from table 1 .",
    "these were done between 1986 and 1992 using telescopes at lowell observatory , eso , and kitt peak .",
    "these data are used to illustrate the identifications ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in each case ,",
    "the iras position is shown by an error ellipse @xmath25 arcseconds in size at the appropriate orientation .",
    "the spectroscopic or radio identification is marked wherever known . in this atlas ,",
    "images not otherwise labelled are from the 1.1 m hall telescope of lowell observatory .",
    "the new imaging is nearly complete north of @xmath26 , and has been supplemented for illustration by red - light images ( where available ) from the digitized sky survey . where the identification is clear from spectroscopic or radio data , we present @xmath24-band magnitudes of these sources in table 3 .",
    "these are mainly intended to guide followup observations ; because of the wide range of angular sizes , they may have errors @xmath27 magnitude from a consistent definition of either isophotal or total values .",
    "these objects range from @xmath1 , with median 15.7 and quartile points at 14.7 and 17.2 .",
    "the source counts for objects with secure optical identifications depart strongly from a euclidean slope for @xmath28 , indicating that we are still missing some even at these bright levels .",
    "this is certainly due in part to incomplete spectroscopic data .",
    "the strong correlation between far - ir and radio fluxes for both active nuclei and star - forming systems suggest that we can refine the positions of candidate agn using radio data at higher spatial resolution .",
    "we initially observed 33 of these fields using the nrao vla at 6 cm .",
    "after most of the optical observations were finished , the vla sky surveys ( first and nvss ) became available , allowing us to refine the positions and nature of many additional sources .",
    "the radio properties , from our own and the survey observations , are given in table 4 .",
    "the radio position is taken from the new 6-cm data , the first ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) catalog , and the nvss ( condon et al . 1998 ) , in that order of precision .",
    "a correspondence is counted as a counterpart if it lies with 80 \" of the iras position .",
    "based on the surface density of first sources at larger projected radii , we expect @xmath29 sources out of our 67 radio detections to be chance coincidences within this radius , and the statistics of position matches suggest that very few of the iras positions are farther off than this .",
    "locations of the radio - continuum sources are shown by circles in fig .",
    "2 . these coincide with plausible optical galaxies for an additional 12 high - probability identifications for which we do not have optical spectra .",
    "there are also another 12 fields where an optical galaxy is so bright as to be a likely identification , but for which we do not have spectroscopic data .",
    "our new vla observations used the d array at 6 cm .",
    "we targeted 26 iras fields , with position and flux results included in table 4 . among these",
    ", there were ten nondetections ; 1704 + 606 is not a sensitive limit , being lost in the sidelobes of 3c 351 . among the detections , most are unresolved using the d array ; a few ( 1439 + 354 , 1712 + 098 , 2028 - 128 ) are resolved with gaussian - fit fwhm in the range 9 - 36 \" .    in two of the 42 cases with both kinds of identification available ,",
    "the emission - line galaxy is not the same object as the radio source .",
    "it is not clear whether the true far - ir sources have only weak line emission , or whether these are the two chance radio sources that would be expected in this sample .",
    "these are 1512 + 366 , where the radio source has @xmath30 , while there is an brighter emission - line galaxy at the edge of the iras error ellipse ; and 1503 + 272 , with comparably faint spectroscopic and radio identifications at opposite sides of the iras ellipse .",
    "comparison of the redshift and magnitude distributions with earlier samples can clarify the ways in which these objects extend our knowledge of the far - ir universe . in particular , we expect this sample to correspond roughly to the color - selected agn found from the point - source catalog , shifted to larger redshift as a result of the deeper flux limit .",
    "the redshift distribution of the spectroscopic identifications ranges up to @xmath3 , with quartiles at @xmath31 and median @xmath32 . for the seyfert galaxies , the quartiles are @xmath33 , with the median and high values the same . of the entire sample ,",
    "10% lie at @xmath34 , while 10% of seyfert galaxies are at @xmath35 . for the seyfert galaxies in the point - source catalog sample ( de grijp et al .",
    "1992 ) , the full range is @xmath36 , with median @xmath37 and quartiles @xmath38 . of these , 10% lie beyond @xmath39 .",
    "three of the 226 psc agn lie beyond our highest redshift at @xmath40 , which is consistent with the much larger psc sample size and our exclusion of bright , previously known objects from the ao sample .",
    "for all 370 extragalactic objects in the psc  warm \" sample , the redshift range spans @xmath41 , with median @xmath42 and quartiles @xmath43 ; 10% of the whole list has @xmath44 .",
    "the cumulative distributions in redshift are best matched if the ao sample of seyferts reaches on average @xmath45 deeper than the psc seyfert , which implies a typical difference of @xmath46 in flux .",
    "this confirms that , to first order , the new sample is reaching farther rather than to lower luminosity .",
    "the uneven sampling depth means that we see about @xmath47 the number of warm sources that simple scaling from the psc predicts for the mean depth and area covered .    at each redshift ,",
    "our criteria include only a fraction of seyfert galaxies , since they have an intrinsic spread in ir colors and a varying mix of host - galaxy dust emission as well .",
    "we can evaluate this fraction at small @xmath48 directly , using the samples of markarian and cfa seyferts ( lipovetskii et al .",
    "1988 , huchra & burg 1992 ) , with fluxes taken from the iras faint - source catalog ( fsc ) . of the 205 markarian seyfert galaxies ,",
    "149 were detected by iras , of which 110 fall within our color bounds .",
    "nearly half ( 57 ) are listed as sy 1 , with the remainder almost evenly split between  intermediate \" types 1.21.9 and sey 2 . among the detected markarian seyferts ,",
    "there is strong overlap in fir luminosity between those included and excluded by our color criteria .",
    "the cfa seyfert nuclei are generally intrinsically fainter , and only 31 of 86 pass these color criteria . of the remainder , 15 were not detected at all by iras . among these",
    ", there is a strong color change with fir luminosity ; the median l(fir ) for objects that would be included in our sample is four times higher than for the ones we reject , which fits with an increasing role for the surrounding cold dust from the host galaxy in fainter nuclei .",
    "sy 1 nuclei slightly outnumber sy 2 s among the  warm \" objects in the cfa sample ( 15:10 ) , comparable to the ratio ( 13:17 ) seen in our newly - found agn .",
    "this surely reflects a bias in the contrast of the agn emission against the surrounding host galaxy ; alexander ( 2001 ) has found that the far - ir spectral shape mostly reflects the ratio of nuclear and disk emission .",
    "some additional sy 2 objects may be hiding within the galaxies for which we see only the red emission lines , limiting our ability to classify them .",
    "of the 94 optical and radio identifications , 13 have probable companion galaxies , while another 13 show disturbed morphologies in our images .",
    "these are both quite high fractions compared to optically - selected samples , but are not exceptional for samples selected at high far - ir luminosity ( see , for example , gallimore & keel 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "as illustrated by the spectra in fig .",
    "2 , the active nuclei in this sample show a range of spectroscopic properties , from classic fe - rich sy 1 to strongly obscured objects with only the red emission lines from a narrow - line region detected .",
    "previous infrared - selected samples show large proportions of sy 2 objects , since the strong blue continuum of typical sy 1 no longer introduces a direct selection bias .",
    "for example , the sample listed by de grijp et al .",
    "( 1992 ) from the point - source catalog includes 144 sy 2 and 82 sy 1 objects .",
    "the deeper ao sample fits this trend within our modest statistics . including sy 1 with the broad component detected only at h@xmath21",
    ", we find roughly equal numbers of sy 1 ( 13 ) and sy 2 ( 17 ) among our identifications .",
    "several previous studies have addressed the demographics of agn selected from colors in the iras point - source catalog .",
    "the objects listed by de grijp et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , selected for @xmath49 in the range [ -1.5,0 ] , show a preponderence of sy 2 , finding 141 sy 2 and 80 sy 1 .",
    "our current sample shows a sy 2:sy 1 ratio of 17:13 . using the same 25 - 60@xmath6 m criterion on a limited sample from the faint - source catalog , gu et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) find nine sy 2 and no sy 1 .",
    "low et al . ( 1988 ) , using @xmath50 , found a high ratio 73:39 .",
    "these values are broadly consistent with a fraction of sy2/(sy1 + sy2 ) near 0.65 , within binomial statistics from these samples .",
    "the sole possible outlier is the small gu et al .",
    "sample , which lies about @xmath51 from this common mean value ( having no broad - line objects ) .",
    "it is thus a general feature of far - ir color selection that roughly twice as many type 2 as type 1 agn appear , reinforcing previous studies in the number of narrow - line agn which are missed by many optical surveys .",
    "this stands in contrast to the dominance of broad - line objects in samples selected for red @xmath52 colors , consistent with the small fraction of our objects falling in this category .",
    "some studies have indicated a connection between the far - ir spectral shape of agn and the strength of the optical fe ii emission multiplets ( lawrence et al .",
    "1988 ; low et al . 1989 ; lipari , macchetto , & golombek 1991 ; zheng & keel 1991 ) .",
    "this sample includes a few individual agn with very strong fe ii .",
    "four of these are noted below .    a few of the obvious seyfert nuclei in this sample are highly reddened , as shown by broad h@xmath21 and little or no h@xmath53 emission .",
    "there are probably additional reddened sy 2 galaxies hidden among the ambiguous objects for which we do not detect enough emission lines to make a definite classification , since the range of [ n ii]/h@xmath21 for seyfert 2 and starburst nuclei overlaps .    of the objects with clear radio or optical counterparts ,",
    "33 are detected in the 2mass survey catalogs .",
    "taking the extended - source entries for objects which also appear in the point - source listing , and combining the near - ir colors with their @xmath24 magnitudes , shows clear relations between @xmath54 or @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "objects without spectroscopic identifications ( either due to faintness or lack of emission lines ) are redder in @xmath56 than the entire sample , while spanning similar ranges of jhk colors .",
    "this is at least consistent with some of the iras ao sources without an optical identification having strongly obscured nuclei , either starbursts or agn . among objects with spectroscopic identifications , starbursts are bluer across the jhk bands than the few seyferts detected ; some sy 1 are as red as @xmath57 .",
    "however , this far - ir color selection does not ( yet ? ) uncover many of the kind of red agn identified by cutri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; among the four 2mass detections of sy 1 in our sample , only 22212 - 0221 satisfies their @xmath5 criterion . to be consistent with their measurement of the space densities of type 1 agn redder and bluer than this limit would require that either the reddest agn in our sample remain preferentially unidentified , or that red agn generally exhibit cooler far - ir spectral shapes .",
    "iras - l 06229 - 6434 - the continuum is flat in f@xmath58 , with very strong fe ii emission .",

    "this object has the reddest jhk colors among agn in this sample also detected in the 2mass survey .",
    "selecting galaxies for unusually warm far - ir colors isolates some kinds of star - forming objects as well as active nuclei .",
    "many of these are optically very blue . the apparent paradox of dusty galaxies not always appearing reddened has been discussed by witt , thronson , & capuano ( 1992 ) and by meurer et al .",
    "these authors ( among others ) point out that when dust and stars are mixed , reddened stars are effectively removed from the observed mix at short wavelengths , so the emerging radiation can be blue ( although attenuated from the dust - free case ) .",
    "scattered light will only accentuate this effect .",
    "a few of these sources are worthy of individual note . in iras - l 09426 - 1929",

    "the northern component dominates at 20 cm .",
    "both 17235 + 4602 and 10360 - 0643 ( ic 630 , mkn 1259 ) have blue continua and strong wolf - rayet n iv + he ii + c ii blends near 4600   .",
    "some of the iras sources in our sample have no plausible optical identifications to @xmath61 . if real , these are particularly interesting as candidates for high - redshift or heavily - obscured objects .",
    "there is precedent for far - ir sources so luminous that we could detect them to high redshifts if we were lucky enough to have one in these fields - the central cluster galaxy with obscured agn in 09104 + 4109 appears in the point - source catalog ( kleinmann et al .",
    "1988 ) at @xmath62 , and the lensed object from the faint source survey , 10214 + 4724 , is at @xmath63 ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    ". however , as we go deeper into the iras data , there are also concerns about the reality of these sources , especially those seen in only a single scan . the best examples of potential blank - field sources are 02247 + 1017 , 04114 + 1150 , and 13557 + 6950 , each of which passed the multiple - detection test on overlapping iras scans . a few other sources have only very faint potential optical counterparts ( @xmath61 ) , such as 17467 + 5600 and 22511 - 1805 ;",
    "this last one was detected on only a single scan .",
    "these objects are not detected in the vla surveys , except for a possible counterpart of 22551 - 1805 in the somewhat confused field of mr2251 - 18 .",
    "there are also a few sources in which we found only absorption - line galaxies - both members of the galaxy pair in the iras error ellipse for 09156 + 4213 , and the brightest galaxy near 09189 + 4620 .",
    "if these are the correct identification for the infrared sources , the cores of these galaxies may be very heavily obscured ; and if not , the genuine ir source must be substantially fainter .",
    "sources with no multiple - observations confirmation ( labelled with nc in table 1 ) do not seem to be any less reliable than the confirmed sources .",
    "their statistics of spectroscopic and radio identification , and of both together , are in fact better than for the sample as a whole . of 19 nc sources ,",
    "we have spectroscopic emission - line identifications for 10 and radio identifications for 11 ( of which nine are in common ) . omitting two galactic objects and an additional bright galaxy without an observed spectrum , there are only 4 unidentified nc sources ( 21% ) , compared with 43/180 ( 24% ) of the overall sample for which no optical identification is apparent ( including bright galaxies not yet observed in detail ) .",
    "the remaining 4 nc sources are thus good candidates for genuine optically - faint warm ir sources .",
    "we have selected warm far - ir sources from the deep iras additional observation ( ao ) data , using color criteria designed to preferentially select warm agn at redshifts @xmath64 from the source population .",
    "of 180 such sources taken from 1040 fields covering @xmath65 square degrees , we have obtained emission - line identifications for 74 ( 41% ) , while vla survey observations suggest identifications for an additional 20 objects without extant optical spectroscopy .",
    "compared to analogous samples from the iras point - source catalog , this sample goes farther in redshift ( rather than to lower luminosities ) as expected for the deeper flux limit .",
    "the median redshift for the entire sample and for identified seyfert galaxies is identical at @xmath66 .",
    "the population of agn selected in this way includes numerous objects with strongly reddened emission - lines , which may be increased by a class of galaxies in which we see only narrow h@xmath21+[n ii ] emission , which could be either reddened agn or dusty starburst systems .",
    "we also find several sy 1 nuclei with very strong fe ii emission , and one composite object with agn - like emission lines superimposed on a bright , fading starburst population . likewise , the star - forming galaxies in this group span the full range of optical color from virtually unreddened to highly obscured .",
    "similar objects in the point - source catalog suggest that the youngest starbursts systematically have the warmest far - ir dust distributions ( fehmers et al .",
    "1994 ) , which may fit with the fact that two of the brightest of these objects , among the few with spectra good enough to tell , exhibit strong wolf - rayet blends near 4650   .",
    "for 10 of these warm iras sources , the most obvious optical identification is with a bright star , and for one fainter one , 13446 - 3625 , the sole emission - line object we have identified has the composite spectrum of a symbiotic star .",
    "we summarize here the properties of these stellar ir sources .",
    "a sufficiently bright star has a high probability of being the correct iras source identification simply on grounds of low surface density .",
    "based on latitude - averaged star counts , we expect only a single star brighter than @xmath67 by chance within all 180 of the @xmath20 \" error ellipses in our survey area . for brighter stars , identifications",
    "are quite secure ; for example , the chance of a single random star with @xmath68 occuring within any of our search ellipses is @xmath69 .",
    "there are 14 stars with @xmath70 in our sample .",
    "three are catalogued semiregular variables of late spectral type for which circumstellar envelopes would be expected ( and these may have been the original targets of the pointed observations ) .",
    "these are 03536 - 7411 = uy hyi , 16308 - 1601 = t oph , and 09371 + 3620 = z lmi .",
    "similarly , 05142 - 0154 is the t tauri star hd 290172 .",
    "one additional fainter star , 13446 - 3625 , turned up in slitless spectra and shows the characteristic combination of a cool stellar continuum plus both low- and high - ionization emission lines for identification as a symbiotic star ( fig .",
    "this combination of properties allowed it to masquerade as a sy 2 galaxy until slit spectroscopy showed just how sharp the tio bandheads are , and a radial velocity @xmath71 km s@xmath72 .",
    "a few of these stars have been examined from the iras all - sky data , although their ao data do not seem to have been hitherto published .",
    "reddy & parthasarathy ( 1996 ) used photometry and optical spectroscopy to classify 05239 - 0626 ( bd @xmath73 1178 ) as an f2 ii star , in a post - agn phase in which recently ejected dust gives the fir emission .",
    "patten & willson ( 1991 ) include 05356 - 2839 ( hd 37484 ) as an ( otherwise normal ) ir - excess star based on its 12@xmath6 flux from the point - source catalog .",
    "the remaining stellar identifications include possible examples of the  vega phenomenon \" , reradiation from large grains perhaps representing the remnant of a protoplanetary disk .",
    "they are listed in table 5 , with identification information from simbad and distances from _",
    "hipparcos_. among these , 54 oph is a double with the brighter component tabulated .",
    "these stars are unusual in extending to later spectral type than usually associated with protoplanetary disks .",
    "the iras ao data include a very deep set of scans of a region in hercules near ( 1950 ) 1632 + 3815 , outlining a roughly n - s field 1.5@xmath74 in length .",
    "this region , about 2@xmath74 nw of m13 , has an unusually low level of ir cirrus emission for its galactic latitude , allowing a very deep set of source extractions and identifications , reaching to 0.01 jy at 60@xmath6 .",
    "we have considered the nature of all 31 sources identified in this field ( table 6 ) as a probe of faint fir populations in general . of these , only two ( both sao stars ) are found in the faint - source catalog .",
    "the original cri data products are no longer available , so we have assessed the noise level using the gridded iras products from the astronomical data center , adding the 8 constituent observations .",
    "this gives @xmath75 point - source errors 0.004 - 0.006 jy , so that only the weakest source we consider is as faint as 3@xmath76 .",
    "there is enough cirrus emission for the detection threshold to change across the field .",
    "we rely mainly on the 60@xmath6 source list ; only three additional sources might be real at 100@xmath6 . at 25@xmath6 ,",
    "the only detections are the two seyfert galaxies , sao stars 1 and 6 , an additional star 3 , and source 11 .",
    "the numbering is consecutive n - s among 60@xmath6 detections .",
    "we obtained @xmath24 images of all these sources except the brighter sao star , equally divided between the kpno 2.1 m ( ti ccd , binned at 0.39``/pixel ) and lowell 1.1 m ( ti ccd with focal reducer , 0.71''/pixel ) .",
    "eight sources with obvious optical counterparts were examined spectroscopically with the wht and faint - object spectrograph ( section 2.2 ) . in -",
    "scan position uncertainties yield error ellipses alongated e - w in this field .",
    "the sources are listed in table 6 .",
    "two of them are seyfert galaxies , both of which are bright enough and spectrally warm enough to be included in our main all - sky sample .",
    "source 4 in this field is iras - s 16320 + 3730 , while source 8 is iras - l 16327 + 3747 .",
    "in addition , source number 2 is w herculis , an oh / ir mira - type star whose dst properties have been derived from the iras psc by hashimoto ( 1994 ) .    as is the case for the main ao agn sample",
    ", we can improve the quality of source identifications by exploiting the strong connection between far - ir and radio flux .",
    "eight of these iras sources have a first 20-cm source within 90 \" ; in one case , there are two first sources , one associated with a bright disk galaxy and the other a blank field .",
    "iras source 20 is associated with the blazar 1633 + 382 ( b2 1633 + 28 , 4c + 38.41 ) at @xmath77 , showing strong radio emission with a 20-cm flux density of 2 jy .",
    "the source identifications include a starburst galaxy at @xmath78 ( number 9 ) and a bright outlying member of a rich group or cluster ( number 15 ) .",
    "our initial identification in that case was the central cd galaxy , which suggested an analogy with iras 09104 + 4109 ( kleinmann et al .",
    "1988 ) , but the radio source clearly belongs to the secondary elliptical .",
    "these source associations are of high significance ; the source density above 2 mjy in this region of the first survey would give 1 unrelated source within the sum of 31 iras error ellipses .",
    "some of the optical identifications with first coordinates are quite faint , as might be expected from the low iras flux levels we reach in this field . as a result ,",
    "to the extent that the radio - infrared identifications are identical at this flux level , we were less successful in guessing the proper objects for spectroscopy based on the iras positions and optical images alone than for the stronger agn sample .",
    "this underscores the importance of accurate coordinates ( often assisted by the radio - infrared correlation ) in identification of such faint infrared sources .",
    "the data handling and source extraction used the facilities of the centraal rekeninstituut leiden .",
    "the early stages of this project benefited from the encouragement and support of h. van der laan .",
