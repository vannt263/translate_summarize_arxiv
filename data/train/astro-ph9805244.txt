    "the scientific goal of applying the doppler imaging technique to ap stars , is to provide observational constraints on the diffusion mechanism in the presence of a global magnetic field .",
    "@xmath5 uma ( hd 112185 , hr 4905 ) , an a0pcr star , is known as the brightest member ( v=1.77 ) of the class of peculiar a type stars .",
    "bohlender and landstreet ( 1990 ) measured a weak , reversing magnetic field for @xmath5 uma , that appears to be dominated by a dipole component with a polar magnetic field strength in the order of 400 gauss .",
    "furthermore , maps of @xmath1 , @xmath0 ( rice & wehlau , 1997 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( babel et al . , 1995 ) have been published , whereby the distribution of each of these elements appears to be correlated with the assumed dipole magnetic field geometry .",
    "observations of @xmath5 uma were done in june 1994 and in march 1995 at the observatoire de haute - provence using the spectrograph aurlie ( attached to the 1.52-m telescope ) in two spectral regions : 4060 - 4260  and 4440 - 4640  .",
    "the spectral resolution is about 20000 and the signal - to - noise ratio above 150 .",
    "the maps were calculated by using the surface imaging technique described by piskunov and rice ( 1993 ) . a kurucz atlas9 model atmosphere with @xmath8  k and @xmath9 was used for computing the local line profile tables .",
    "the value of @xmath10 was assumed to be @xmath11  kms@xmath12 and the inclination angle @xmath13 was chosen as 45 @xmath14 .",
    "both values give a minimal deviation of the observed line profiles from the computed ones .",
    "the rotation phases of the spectra we used for mapping were computed according to : @xmath15 .",
    "the surface abundance distributions of the five elements we treated can be divided into two groups .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( figure 1 ) distributions show a clear depleted band which coincides with the assumed magnetic equator , confirming the results of rice & wehlau .",
    "the @xmath4 distribution is very similar to that of these elements , which accumulate near the magnetic poles .",
    "they are all slightly overabundant compared to solar values : @xmath4 and @xmath1 are about 0.8 dex above solar values , while @xmath0 is 1 dex above .    however , the @xmath2 ( figure 2 ) and @xmath3 surface structures have much less contrast in terms of peak - to - peak abundances and are apparently not significantly correlated with the magnetic dipole geometry .",
    "so far , seven different elements have been mapped for @xmath5 uma .    together with the @xmath6 and @xmath7 maps published by babel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which reveal abundance enhancements located at the magnetic equator , the maps of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 provide important constraints for building models of diffusion in the presence of a global magnetic field .",
    "this should provide a better understanding of the hydrodynamics in the atmospheres of ap stars ."
