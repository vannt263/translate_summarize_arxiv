    "there is a rather large consensus to ascribe to galaxy mergers a prominent role in the formation of early - type galaxies , especially the most massive ones . for almost 40 years",
    ", numerical simulations and observations have supported this hypothesis .",
    "the debate is however still very active on the details of this merger - based mass assembly : is it primarily due to minor / major , dry / wet mergers ? when did the merging events occur , and in which types of environment ?",
    "study of their internal properties , in particular their kinematics , shows that the properties of etgs change along the luminosity function , with a general trend for galaxies to transition from slow to fast rotators , while peculiar objects can show distinct features such as kinematically decoupled cores ( see the review by e. emsellem in this volume , and references therein ) .",
    "are mergers able to reproduce the full variety of observed properties ?",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed that a fraction of etgs , especially those with high ellipticity , might have formed at high redshift by secular evolution , i.e. from the interaction , migration and merging of massive condensations formed in highly turbulent disks , supplied by cold gas flows ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* elmegreen et al . , 2008 ) ) .",
    "all these processes produce remnants that have a luminosity profile characterized by a high sersic index , but with very different morphologies in the outermost regions . while the secular model does not produce any fine structure ( fig.[fig:0 ] , right ) , the imprint of ( multiple ) minor mergers are shells and narrow stellar streams ( fig.[fig:0 ] , middle ) and that of major mergers between spirals are prominent , long , tidal tails ( fig.[fig:0 ] , left ) .",
    "thus , by studying the properties of collisional debris , one might be able to reconstruct the mass assembly of their progenitors .",
    "this method must , however , address the following issues ( 1 ) debris has a very low  surface brightness , usually below 26 mag arcsec@xmath0 in the g band ( 2 ) debris fades with age  it might be used as a clock for age - dating merger events  or may be dispersed in their environment : the memory of its origin is then lost ( 3 ) galaxies may be formed by hybrid processes .",
    "current detailed numerical simulations done in cosmological context precisely address these issues and are now capable of relating the merging / accretion history of the simulated galaxies with the number , shape , brightness and ages of the fine structures present at the end of their evolution .",
    "the ultra - deep images presented here were obtained with the large field - of - view megacam camera installed on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "they were taken as part of two large projects :    * @xmath1 , a multi - wavelength survey of a complete sample of 260 nearby early - type galaxies within 42 mpc , complemented by semi - analytical and numerical models ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cappellari et al . , 2011 ) ) .",
    "a sub - sample of approximately 100 etgs located in the field and in groups were selected for follow - up deep optical imaging in the g and r bands . *",
    "the next generation virgo cluster survey ( ngvs ) , which maps the entire virgo cluster area in the u*,g,r,i and z bands ( ferrarese et al . , 2011 , in prep . ) . within the 104 square - degrees covered by the ngvs",
    ", there are about 50 etgs that are part of the @xmath1 sample .",
    "these two surveys reach the same surface brightness limit : about 29 mag arcsec@xmath0 in the g - band ( about 2.5 mag deeper than the sdss )",
    ". such a sensitivity could only be achieved by using specific observing and data - reduction procedures .",
    "basically , each observation consisted of multiple exposures dithered with a very large pattern ( between 7 and 70 ) so as to minimize sky background variations .",
    "the total exposure time varied between 0.5 and 2 hours depending on the band .",
    "the data were processed at cfht with the elixir low surface brightness arm of the megacam pipeline at cfht ( cuillandre et al .",
    "2011 , in prep . )",
    "the unprecedented depth achieved by these surveys introduces us to a new imaging regime , full of faint foreground stars , halos of bright stars , extended , scattered light from galactic cirrus , distant background galaxies and clusters .... and previously unknown stellar streams associated to the early - types galaxies .",
    "two examples of newly discovered extended stellar structures are presented here .",
    "elongated , narrow streams from a disrupted satellite , wrapping around the host galaxy are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "this is the first step of a minor merger .",
    "[ fig:2 ] discloses prominent , long , tidal tails sticking out of what was so far considered as a massive , relaxed , elliptical , classified as a slow rotator , with the  definition ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* emsellem et al . , 2011 ) ) .",
    "* duc et al . ( 2011 ) ) argue that these features are likely collisional debris of a relatively recent major merger that occurred 2 to 5 gyr ago .",
    "the detection of hi gas along some blue condensations in the tail  in fact mature tidal dwarf galaxies  suggests that the progenitors were gas  rich as well . without the support of ultra - deep images , such clouds might have been interpreted as signs of on - going gas accretion from cold flows ( see review by van gorkom in this volume for possible examples of such clouds around nearby galaxies ) .",
    "the formation of a massive , round , etg by a wet merger that occurred below a redshift of 0.5 is at odds with some predictions from semi - analytical models and numerical simulations : indeed , the formation of such galaxies seems to require a long process involving a high - z major merger followed by multiple minor mergers .",
    "+        these initial results illustrate the potential of ultra - deep optical images to reconstruct the mass assembly of individual galaxies and trace their ancestors .",
    "furthermore , the   / ngvs megacam images and follow - up multi - wavelength surveys will provide statistics on the number and properties of the fine structures around galaxies , and thus allow to investigate how the main mechanism driving the mass assembly may vary as a function of their morphological type and large - scale environment ."
