    "electroweak symmetry breaking sectors which are composed of two scalar isospin - doublets predict charged higgs bosons ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "their discovery at future colliders will directly indicate such a non - minimal structure of the higgs sector , and its detailed information will give strong hints for the structre of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "therefore , their phenomenology has been evaluated especially over the past few years as their discovery potential has become more clear .    at cern",
    "large hadron collider , charged higgs bosons below the top quark mass will be produced in the top quark decay process . for heavier charged higgs bosons",
    ", they will be produced mainly through the subprocesses @xmath2 , @xmath3 and their charge conjugate , and they may be probed , for example , using the decay modes @xmath4 and its charge conjugate especially for large @xmath5 values , in spite of huge qcd backgrounds .    on the other hand , at future electron - positron linear colliders ( lc s ) , the dominant production process should be the pair production@xcite @xmath6 .",
    "its cross section depends only on the charged higgs mass , and this process provides a hallmark channel through which we can study @xmath1 phenomenology@xcite as long as the charged higgs boson mass ( @xmath7 ) is sufficiently smaller than its kinematical threshold @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath7 is near or above @xmath8 , the pair production is not available .",
    "in such a case , the phenomenology of charged higgs bosons may be explored through the kinematically - allowed single production processes .    in this talk , we discuss various single @xmath1 production channels to complement the pair production channel .",
    "we consider the following processes@xcite : @xmath9 the @xmath10 associated production mode ( [ proc_tau ] ) has been studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "the processes ( [ proc_tb ] ) , ( [ proc_lwh ] ) , ( [ proc_bwh ] ) and ( [ proc_awh ] ) , as well as ( [ proc_zwh ] ) with @xmath11 lead to the same final state @xmath12@xcite .",
    "the one - loop induced processes @xmath13 have also been studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "the one - loop induced @xmath14 and @xmath15 vertices which enter into ( [ proc_enu ] ) have been calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "we evaluate cross sections of the above single production processes at the leading order . the two - higgs - doublet - model ( 2hdm ) parameters",
    "are taken assuming the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "for the sm parameters we adopted the following numbers : @xmath16 gev , @xmath17 gev , @xmath18 mev , @xmath19 gev , @xmath20 , @xmath21 gev , @xmath22 gev , @xmath23 gev , @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of the collider ( @xmath26 ) is assumed to be @xmath27 gev and @xmath28 gev .",
    "details of the calculation and the plots are shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 associated production processes ( [ proc_tau ] ) , shown in fig .  1 , are dominated by the pair production as long as it is kinematically allowed ( @xmath29 ) . above this threshold ,",
    "the cross sections still exceed @xmath30 pb at large @xmath5 values . if @xmath1 is heavy enough to decay into @xmath31 , dominant background contribution comes from top - quark pair production . by peforming @xmath32 and @xmath33 mass reconstruction ,",
    "the background can be reduced naively by @xmath34 , so that the signal would be visible , although detailed simulations are needed depending on each machine .",
    "+     +    the @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) associated production process ( [ proc_tb ] ) has a similar structure to @xmath37 modes , but the @xmath5 dependence is opposite : the rate is larger for smaller @xmath5 values .",
    "the cross section is suppressed above the pair production threshold in comparison with that of @xmath37 modes because of the difference in the phase space .",
    "figure  2 shows the cross section of the one - loop induced processes @xmath38 ( [ proc_wh ] ) . for small @xmath5 values ,",
    "the @xmath39 coupling included in each quark - loop diagram is large so that the cross section becomes substantial : the @xmath5 dependence of the cross section is @xmath40 at small @xmath5 and @xmath41 at very large @xmath5 .",
    "the cross section remains large beyond the pair production kinematic limit .",
    "when the dominant @xmath1 decay mode is @xmath42 , we can deal with the top pair background by reconstructing the final state and eliminating events with two top quarks .",
    "this is expected to reduce the top pair background by about @xmath43 , which should enable the observation of the peak at the charged higgs mass in some regions of the parameter space .    for the rest of the processes , ( [ proc_enu])-([proc_enah ] ) ,",
    "there is a variety of structures observed in the cross sections .",
    "their rates , however , turned out to be very small for larger @xmath7 than the pair production threshold .",
    "this is owing to the reasons such as coupling suppression , cancellation between feynman diagrams , and/or smaller phase space .",
    "details of the numerical results are shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "as mentioned , the processes ( [ proc_tb ] ) , ( [ proc_zwh ] ) , ( [ proc_lwh ] ) , ( [ proc_bwh ] ) and ( [ proc_awh ] ) lead to the final state @xmath44 .",
    "some channels have large cross sections for @xmath29@xcite .",
    "the variety of resonance structures imply little interference among these processes .",
    "the @xmath45 modes , therefore , complement the pair production in the charged higgs study at lc especially below the threshold of the pair production@xcite .",
    "the procedure for the tagging of the final state @xmath44 is outlined in ref.@xcite .    in either process ,",
    "information of the tau@xcite and the top@xcite polarization can be used to help identify the charged higgs boson .",
    "we found that the @xmath46 channel and the loop induced @xmath47 channel are the most promising channels for studying charged higgs phenomenology beyond the kinematic limit for pair production .",
    "the @xmath47 channel is enhanced at low @xmath5 , whereas the @xmath46 channel is enhanced at large @xmath5 . for the charged higgs bosons whose mass is below the pair production threshold , some of the single production channels which lead to the @xmath44 final state complement the pair production .",
    "some of their cross sections become large , but they are rapidly suppressed above the kinematic limit of the pair production .",
    "our results motivate further study of the decay modes , the hadronic final states and the backgrounds relevant to these charged higgs boson single production processes .",
