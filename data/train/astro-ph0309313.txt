    "the use of simple physical prescriptions for the transport of metals in the different phases and the choice of a few , physically motivated , parameters allow us to reproduce the relation between stellar mass and metallicity inferred from new sdss data as well as the observed amount of metals in the icm .",
    "the good agreement between the model predictions and the observational data shows that the circulation of metals between the different baryonic components of the cluster is being well tracked .",
    "our analysis shows that the chemical pollution of the icm occurs at relatively high redshift : @xmath0 per cent of the metals today present in the icm were ejected at redshifts larger than @xmath1 .",
    "massive galaxies are important contributors to the chemical enrichment of the icm : @xmath2 per cent of the metals today in the icm were ejected by galaxies with mass larger than @xmath3 .    2.7 in",
    "the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ) is an eso large programme aiming at studying the evolution of cluster population over more that @xmath4 per cent of cosmic time by combining photometric and spectroscopic information on a large sample of clusters at redshift @xmath5 and @xmath6 with existing information on well studied nearby clusters .",
    "we can compare our simulations to the data to study how the efficiency and relative importance of processes such as quiescent and interaction - driven star formation , ram - pressure stripping , harassment , strangulation and merging , affect the observable structure and stellar populations of cluster galaxies .",
