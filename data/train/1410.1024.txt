    "a main goal of topological polymer statistics is that of determining up to what extent the thermodynamics of macromolecular chains is affected by the presence of a fixed topological entanglement  . clarifying issues related to knots and links in polymer physics",
    "has been since long recognized of key importance in a variety of fields , ranging from molecular biology to nanotechnology  @xcite .",
    "so far , for isolated ring polymers , which are the object of the present study , most theoretical and numerical approaches provided informations referring to ensembles with unrestricted topology .",
    "this means that information on the frequency of occurrence of different knots is in general not available for models of random ring polymer configurations .",
    "one does not have an idea of the extent to which , at least for long chains , these frequencies could reveal universal features , possibly connected to topological invariants .",
    "thus , it remains unclear how different topologies contribute to the global free energy of systems described in such ensembles .",
    "this situation contrasts with the fact that ring polymers are not expected to change their topology in most experimental situations .",
    "another fundamental problem is that of understanding if the presence of a fixed topology can give rise to thermodynamic effects , which would not be revealed within mixed topology ensembles .",
    "the difficulty of answering questions like those above and the complexity of the scenarios the answers outline , depend in first place on the degree of localization of topological entanglement in the conditions considered for the polymer  @xcite .",
    "for example , when dealing with polymers in good solvent , we know that the prime components of a knot are weakly localized  @xcite .",
    "each prime component of the knot behaves almost like a small bead sliding along the backbone .",
    "this makes it relatively simple to guess the gross structure of finite size corrections to the free energy expected for a knotted ring  @xcite .",
    "the form of these corrections and the behavior of asymptotic relative frequencies of different knots are now known in great detail thanks to studies based on samples of configurations of extremely long knotted self - avoiding rings on a lattice  . indeed ,",
    "while as established also by rigorous theorems  , unknotted configurations in good solvent should occur with zero frequency in infinite chains , it is necessary to consider very long rings in order to observe with appreciable frequency knotted configurations .",
    "for swollen polymers the decay to zero with increasing backbone length of the frequency of initially dominant , unknotted configurations is too slow to allow a rich enough sampling of knots with short rings .",
    "the situation is quite different , and in several aspects more interesting , in the case of globular ring polymers .",
    "for chains in bad solvent it is well established that topological entanglement is delocalized and spreads along the whole backbone  @xcite .",
    "this delocalization is accompanied by the fact that models for generating random polymer configurations show a rich spectrum of knots already for relatively short chains .",
    "the unknot in this case does not occur with zero probability relative to any knotted configuration in the limit of infinitely long rings . to the contrary",
    ", there is evidence of an asymptotic spectrum in which the relative frequencies of all knots with respect to the unknot approach finite , nonzero limits  @xcite .",
    "additional interest in the globuli is due to some recently discovered  @xcite , remarkable thermodynamic properties directly linked to topology , which manifest themselves in processes like translocation through membrane pores .    the first steps towards a characterization of the spectrum of knots in ring polymers in the globular phase were made in ref .  @xcite . due to the difficulty of sampling dense configurations by monte carlo , the investigation was limited to a single temperature below the @xmath1 point of self - avoiding rings on cubic lattice with attractive nearest neighbor interactions",
    "this study showed that the relative frequencies of different knots tend to finite asymptotic values and have a ranking consistent with a zipf law .",
    "a further result concerns the dependence of the globular free energy on the topological invariants of the knot : while in the infinite ring limit the free energy per monomer is independent of topology , a dependence on the minimal crossing number ( @xmath2 ) of the knot enters in one of its subleading finite size corrections ref .",
    "@xcite ( an example of knot with @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfacf ] ) .",
    "this last result suggests that the value of @xmath2 could play a relevant role in the thermodynamics of a knotted globule . a way to shed light on this role consists in studying the behavior of the globule under geometrical constraints which interfere with the topology . in ref .",
    "@xcite this kind of investigation was first performed using slipping links which divide the single globule in two interacting and possibly knotted loops in equilibrium .",
    "the simulations showed that indeed the respective minimal number of crossings precisely determines the way in which the two loops share the total ring length on average .",
    "the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite on the topological correction to the free energy per monomer were also the basis for explaining a remarkable and unexpected phenomenon occurring when the slip link is replaced by a hole in a repulsive plane separating the ring in two non - interacting globuli with different topologies .",
    "this configuration schematizes a ring polymer translocating through a membrane pore .",
    "the different minimal number of crossings of the two knotted loops induces an asymmetry in the free energies of the competing globuli favoring configurations in which the globule with more crossings keeps most of the available backbone length .",
    "this asymmetry thus distorts the two otherwise symmetrical global free energy minima due to the surface tension of the globuli .",
    "steps on the cubic lattice , and its shortened form after the bfacf   reduction procedure with a low fugacity per step . the latter reveals that the ring holds a @xmath4 knot , whose projection with the minimal crossing number @xmath3 is also shown .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    while being of fundamental interest , the problems mentioned above should be directly relevant for practical applications . besides the translocation processes , of central importance for biology ,",
    "the study of topological spectra of dna extracted from viral capsids is a typical context where the knowledge of spectra for specific models of random polymers is very valuable  @xcite .",
    "model calculations like those carried out in the present work could also help in addressing issues like the known relative rarity of knots one finds in native globular proteins  @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the effects of topological constraints on globular polymers , both in and out of equilibrium , is also expected to be a key to understand chromosomal architecture  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we considerably extend and discuss in further detail some of the results presented in refs .",
    "rather than assuming the more global perspective implicit in the zipf law , here we look at the relative asymptotic frequencies of the simplest knots in globular ring polymers .",
    "the results furnish a clear evidence of the independence of temperature of these frequencies in the whole region below the @xmath1 point and suggest the intriguing possibility that they represent universal , topology related numbers .",
    "this investigation proceeds in parallel with a better determination of the topological correction to the free energy of the globuli already postulated in  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of data in a whole range of low temperatures gives stronger support to the conjectured form and corroborates the explanation of the already mentioned bias due to topology in the translocation of the globuli .",
    "our analysis also shows that the strength of the topological correction is connected to the length of the knots in their ideal , minimal length form  .",
    "this connection sheds light on the reason why the correction itself seems to be determined primarily and almost exclusively by the minimal crossing number of the knots .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model and describe the methods of monte carlo simulation used for our analysis .",
    "relative frequencies and free energies of knotted globuli _ is devoted to the analysis of the data for relative frequencies at different temperatures and to their extrapolation for infinitely long rings .",
    "the form of the finite size topological correction to the free energy and its dependence on both the minimal number of crossings and temperature are discussed in this section . in section _ the role of @xmath2 in the thermodynamics of the globule _ we present results concerning the interference of geometrical constraints due to slip - links with topology . in section",
    "_ effects of the topological correction in translocation _ we refine our discussion of the effects of constraints due to translocation set - ups , and verify their consistency with the postulated topological finite size correction for the globular free energy .",
    "we also discuss the evidence of a connection between the topological correction and the properties of ideal knots .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we model cyclic , flexible polymers with excluded volume as @xmath5-step self - avoiding rings on a cubic lattice ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bfacf ] ) . in order to induce collapse at low enough temperature @xmath0",
    ", we introduce an attractive interaction ( @xmath6 ) between nearest neighbors sites visited by the ring which are not consecutive along the backbone .      a first problem encountered in our analysis",
    "is that of generating a sufficient number of uncorrelated collapsed configurations by monte carlo . to this purpose",
    "we have to fix the temperature below the @xmath1 point , which in our units is at @xmath7  @xcite . the pruned enriched rosenbluth method ( perm )",
    "is efficient in generating collapsed polymer configurations  @xcite ; as discussed below , we could obtain reasonably rich samplings down to @xmath8 , for chains with length up to @xmath9 .",
    "of course , the study of the topological spectrum of the generated ring configurations involves another task , which is even more demanding : that of determining the knot type of each sampled configuration . this constitutes the bottleneck of our simulations .",
    "indeed , it turns out to be a relatively minor problem the fact that perm generates open chains and that we must discard most of them , keeping only those becoming rings upon addition of a further step .    since the collapsed configurations are geometrically very intricated , with planar projections presenting huge numbers of crossings , before attempting a successful analysis of the knot type we need to simplify each configuration while keeping its topology unaltered .",
    "this simplification is achieved with a grand - canonical algorithm of the bfacf type  , which has the property of preserving the knot type because it lets the configurations evolve only with local and crankshaft deletion / insertion moves . in our case",
    "the simplification is achieved with a bias toward deletion that emerges from choosing a low fugacity @xmath10 per step . after a rapid shrinking of the ring ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bfacf ] ) , it is eventually possible to analyze the knot type on the basis of homfly polynomials within the `` knotscape '' program  @xcite .      for studying the effects of external geometrical constraints on globular rings with fixed topology , we apply the bfacf grand canonical simulation method . as already explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a drawback of this method when applied to polymers below the @xmath1 point : the length @xmath5 of the generated configurations does not grow continuously to @xmath11 with the step fugacity , upon approaching its critical value from below  @xcite .",
    "this behavior , consistent with the tricritical character of the @xmath1 point , is due to the fact that the globule for @xmath12 has an interfacial free energy growing as its surface , i.e. @xmath13 , in addition to the bulk one growing like @xmath5 . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not possible to gradually tune the length of the simulated rings just by varying @xmath10 . in order to do so , as already explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce an extra @xmath5-dependent gaussian weight multiplying the grand - canonical one for the configurations ( an alternative method was recently proposed in  @xcite ) .",
    "this weight is maximum at a tunable @xmath14 and has a sufficiently small width , so that @xmath15 during the simulation .",
    "thus , the sampling is essentially canonical up to relatively small fluctuations in @xmath5 .",
    "this canonical character is needed in the analysis of how the competition between geometry and topology evolves as a function of the length of the rings , keeping the other parameters fixed .",
    "the form of the free energy of a ring polymer at @xmath12 can be guessed on the basis of an analogy with the swollen case and of the peculiar physical features of the globular phase . in particular",
    ", we can expect two facts : i ) the free energy per monomer @xmath16 in the bulk of the globules is lower than the free energy @xmath17 of monomers on the interface between the globule and the solvent ; ii ) the number of monomers on the surface of a ( smooth ) globule scales asymptotically as @xmath18 .",
    "thus , a plausible starting ansatz  @xcite for the canonical partition function of a collapsed ring with @xmath5 steps , in an ensemble with unrestricted topology , is @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a dimensionless interfacial correction to the bulk free energy . indeed",
    "the number of monomers on the smooth globular surface grow as @xmath18 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the factor @xmath23 is just written in analogy with the swollen case and accounts for a possible further non extensive logarithmic correction to the free energy .",
    "in fact even tentative estimates of @xmath24 for the globular phase were not available until quite recently , when some of the present authors proposed a monte carlo method for its determination  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on an ansatz for @xmath25 , the partition function of a globule with specific knot @xmath26 . as a first hypothesis we could expect that at least some of the quantities in eq .",
    "( 1 ) assume a dependence on @xmath26 in order to represent the physics of a globule with fixed knot : @xmath27 studies of the self - avoiding rings at @xmath28 , for which @xmath29 , have shown that in the swollen phase the amplitude @xmath30 indeed depends on @xmath26 , while @xmath31 does not seem to vary with the knot type  @xcite for all temperatures @xmath32 is also expected ( and known exactly in the limit @xmath33  ) that @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the unknot .",
    "remarkable in that case is the marked @xmath26 dependence of @xmath24 , which is increasing by one unit for each prime component of @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "thus , the frequencies of different knots relative to the unknot turn out to diverge for @xmath36 with a factor @xmath5 raised to a power equal to the number of prime components of @xmath26 .",
    "this behavior as a function of @xmath5 is a strong confirmation that @xmath31 does not depend on @xmath26 in that case .",
    "we have sampled collapsed rings with the perm algorithm at five different temperatures well below the @xmath1 point : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath5 s chosen for sampling are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . however , in some cases we will show only data up to @xmath50 or @xmath51 because the statistics ( especially of some complex knots ) was not rich enough for the larger @xmath5 s at the lower temperatures .    , for five different temperatures . ]",
    "when analyzing the globular phase , a first key property to study is the ( absolute ) probability @xmath52 of the unknotted configuration within the ensemble with unrestricted topology . as in the case of @xmath53 ,",
    "the frequency of unknotted configurations is exponentially decreasing with @xmath5 , but much more rapidly .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p0 ] , the decay constant @xmath54 is of the order of @xmath42 for all @xmath0 , while for self - avoiding polygons without attraction it would be of the order of @xmath55 .",
    "this explains why simulations in the globular phase generate a much richer variety of knotted configurations than in the swollen phase already for moderately long chains . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we list the estimated @xmath54 values for all temperatures",
    ". a trend of @xmath54 becoming lower with the temperature is evident .",
    "for @xmath56 one might expect that @xmath54 tends to a value similar or equal to the one estimated for hamiltonian walks  @xcite .",
    ".some parameters for data at different temperatures : the @xmath54 for the exponential decay of the probability of unknots , the @xmath57 & @xmath58 for fits @xmath59 of data in fig .",
    "[ fig : mk ] , and @xmath57 of the fits @xmath60 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mk ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      competing with a @xmath61 in the configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig : sl](b ) for @xmath62",
    ". points are data in the form @xmath63 $ ] while the solid curve is a plot of @xmath64 fitted with eq .",

    "this in spite of the fact that we assume still validity of the form in eq .",
    "( 5 ) for the first globule .",
    "the last equation gives for @xmath70 a leading behavior @xmath71 ( we recall that @xmath72 ) . the second term on the righthand side is a small correction , and the relation may be approximately inverted to express the typical length @xmath69 as a function of @xmath73 , @xmath74^{3/5}\\ ] ] recent results  @xcite give estimates of @xmath75 in the range @xmath76 . from these results , at the inverse temperature @xmath77 we interpolate @xmath78 , which can be used to check that the predictions of ( 10 ) are fairly consistent with direct estimates of @xmath69 from the maxima of @xmath79 , see the last two columns of table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "there could be a bias of the indirect estimates toward larger values , which might come from knot - independent corrections to scaling .",
    "however , the general trend follows closely that of the @xmath69 of probability maxima .        the relation between the typical length and the corrections to scaling may be extended to include a further relation with the length of ideal knots . for off - lattice",
    "knotted flexible yet impenetrable tubes of thickness @xmath80 and length @xmath81 , the ideal length @xmath82 of a given knot is the smallest ratio @xmath83 one can achieve  @xcite . for a lattice knot",
    "the `` ideal '' configurations are those with the minimal number ( @xmath84 ) of steps  @xcite .",
    "the probability maxima discussed above are located at relatively small values of @xmath69 , not too far from @xmath85 .",
    "this suggests that the configurations taken by the loop with @xmath86 for @xmath87 could be somehow reminiscent , up to temperature dependent moderate deviations , of the configurations of minimal length , with @xmath88 .",
    "evidence of the plausibility of this relation is obtained by reporting our determinations of @xmath73 divided by @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal](a ) , and divided by @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal](b ) ( note that the known values suggest that to a first approximation @xmath91 ) .",
    "thus , the existence of the topological correction and its dependence on topology should ultimately follow from the fact that tight knots have a minimal length depending primarily on @xmath2 .",
    "this is but another instance in which the ideal form of knots is in close relation with their physical behavior  @xcite .",
    "we conclude by adding that in principle the terms in eq .",
    "( 5 ) may be complemented with knot - independent corrections to scaling .",
    "while we have assessed with nonlinear fits of the distributions @xmath79 that any correction @xmath92 would be present with a prefactor of order unity ( as opposed the @xmath70 s , which are at least @xmath93 ) , there remains to understand whether corrections such as @xmath94 with @xmath95 would play a role .",
    "preliminary results appear to show that @xmath96 if @xmath97 is assumed . with this magnitude , the corrections would just slightly modify quantitatively but not qualitatively our conclusions above .",
    "globular or dense polymers are known as an hard subject in statistical physics , from both theoretical and numerical points of view . with the present contribution we tried to show that they provide an unexpectedly rich context in which to pursue the goals of topological polymer statistics .",
    "indeed , many of the results we obtained are rather unexpected and surprising , in some cases also for their deceptive simplicity .",
    "going deeper into these issues constitutes an open challenge .    when considering rings in the globular phase , any planar projection of the configurations yields an enormous number of crossings  @xcite , growing like @xmath98 .",
    "this huge number of crossings makes extremely difficult the analysis of the type of knot , which requires to sort out the few crossings which are essential characterization of the knot . in spite of this",
    ", we showed that the thermodynamics of the globule is driven by the number of these minimal crossings in several ways , and that in some situations @xmath2 can become unexpectedly a key parameter for determining the stability of the system .    in first place we clarified the role of topology in determining the spectrum of globular knots in a standard model of collapsed polymer rings .",
    "this provides a unique example so far of spectrum in which all knots , prime or composite , enter with comparable frequencies ( for swollen rings such balance occurs only within subclasses of knots with the same number of prime components ) .",
    "the remarkable independence of the relative frequencies on temperature suggests that they are universal ratios and poses the question of their link with the knot topological invariants .",
    "another surprising result is provided by the topological free energy correction and its dependence on the minimal crossing number @xmath2 . under the constraint imposed by a slip link , which does not allow trespassing of the knots from one loop to the other",
    ", @xmath2 appears to control very sharply and exclusively the average share of backbone between the loops . at the same time",
    "this average behavior results from an interesting regime of broad fluctuations obeying a form of taylor scaling  @xcite .",
    "the numerical experiments concerning the translocation of the globule through a repulsive plane with a hole are perhaps the most interesting both within the context of the present investigation , and in the perspective of future applications . besides providing a strong support to the postulated form of the topological free energy correction , our results indicate how far reaching can be the influence of @xmath2 in determining behaviors such as entropic forces driven by topology .",
    "notably , we found that these features are related to the concept of ideal knots , whose signature thus emerges in the statistics of random globular knotted polymers .",

    "<S> the statistical mechanics of a long knotted collapsed polymer is determined by a free - energy with a knot - dependent subleading term , which is linked to the length of the shortest polymer that can hold such knot . </S>",
    "<S> the only other parameter depending on the knot kind is an amplitude such that relative probabilities of knots do not vary with the temperature @xmath0 , in the limit of long chains . </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at this conclusion by simulating interacting self - avoiding rings at low @xmath0 on the cubic lattice , both with unrestricted topology and with setups where the globule is divided by a slip link in two loops ( preserving their topology ) which compete for the chain length , either in contact or separated by a wall as for translocation through a membrane pore . </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest that in macromolecular environments there may be entropic forces with a purely topological origin , whence portions of polymers holding complex knots should tend to expand at the expense of significantly shrinking other topologically simpler portions . </S>"
