    "the radiation - condensation ( rc ) instability in an optically thin plasma plays an important role both in space and laboratory plasmas ( cf . refs .  ) .",
    "dust impurities can alter dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the plasma because of their high inertia and the ability to transform thermal energy into radiation .",
    "it was shown by ref . within the framework of a two - fluid ( dust and plasma ) description that the presence of dust particles can change the conditions for the rc instability to grow .",
    "an essential assumption of ref .   was that dust particles contribute to the radiative cooling .",
    "in many situations , however , dust provides instead the energy input to plasma due to photo - emission of electrons from the dust surface when the system is exposed to ultraviolet radiation .",
    "such conditions can be met in interstellar plasmas ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) . in this case the energy gained from non - thermal electrons escaping photo - ionized dust grains is transmitted to thermal electrons in the ambient plasma , which then in turn heat ions and neutrals in elastic collisions .",
    "simultaneously , the electrons lose their energy and pressure radiatively , and therefore are compressed under the external pressure . in this picture dust particles and electrons are the thermodynamically active components , while neutrals and ions represent the passive components providing conditions for radiative cooling of the electrons .",
    "therefore , at such circumstances only a full four - fluid description is adequate . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict ourself in this paper to consideration of a non - magnetized plasma .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "ii.a we present the full set of four - fluid equations describing the evolution of the plasma under consideration , followed by the description of the energy exchange between the fluids in sec .  ii.b . in sec .",
    "iii.a we present the linearized dynamical equations , and in sec .",
    "iii.b we derive the instability criterion for the condensation mode .",
    "the analysis of the instability is given in sec .",
    "we close our paper with a short summary in sec .",
    "we start from a four - fluid unmagnetized system ( based on refs .   and for a magnetized plasma ) for electrons ( @xmath0=@xmath1 ) , ions ( @xmath0=@xmath2 ) , neutral atoms ( @xmath0=@xmath3 ) and massive charged dust particles ( @xmath0=@xmath4 ) :    [ conti ] _ tn_+(n__)=0 ,    [ mom ] _",

    ".   for a wide range of wavelengths relevant to the rc instability , separation of the dust charge can be neglected , such that the charged components are coupled through the quasi - neutrality condition    [ quasi ] n_e=_e^_n_.    we assume the ions to be singly charged , so that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "as the dust is usually negatively charged in the systems under consideration , we write @xmath11 , so that a positive value of @xmath12 corresponds to negatively charged dust and vice versa .",
    "the quasi - neutrality condition , thus , reads    [ quasinew ] n_i - z_d n_d - n_e=0 .",
    "however , the validity of this assumption is limited by the absolute value of dust charge : the characteristic time scale for a radiatively cooling plasma is of the order of @xmath13s in temperature range @xmath14  k. here , @xmath15 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 is the radiative cooling function at @xmath14  k for the interstellar environment , and @xmath18 is the total number density of all species together .",
    "dust separation becomes important when this time is shorter than the inverse dust plasma frequency @xmath19  s , for @xmath20 typical for interstellar plasma , which gives @xmath21 .    for simplicity",
    "we neglect here the collisional source terms in the momentum equations . in the case",
    "when all the four fluids in the unperturbed state are at rest , @xmath22 , we consider here , this assumption can only result in an overestimate of the growth rate , but can not change the instability criterion .",
    "the source terms in the energy equations , @xmath23 , describe the generalized energy gain rate due to radiation and collisional processes . in the interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "the rc instability develops mostly in the warm neutral medium with @xmath14 k , @xmath24 @xmath25 and a fractional ionization of @xmath26 .",
    "small amount of trace heavy elements account for @xmath27 of the gas mass , and a similar amount is confined in dust grains .",
    "the sizes of grains range from @xmath28  to 0.4@xmath29 m ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) , the charge of dust grains in the warm neutral medium is positive and varies from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , e.g. ref .  , depending on size ; for the sake of simplicity we will describe in what follows the dust component as an ensemble of particles of equal masses , @xmath32 g , and equal charges , @xmath12 , assuming the average abundance of dust particles , @xmath33 .",
    "the ion component comprises mostly of protons and singly ionized trace elements such as cii , feii , and siii ( ionized by the interstellar ultraviolet field ) , the neutrals contain hydrogen atoms , hi , and neutral oxygen , oi .",
    "helium is neutral in the warm neutral medium , and its contribution to radiative processes is negligible at low temperatures @xmath34 k , therefore it can be included in the system by multiplying the mass of the neutral particles by factor of 1.4 .",
    "we have used the two sets of abundances corresponding to the standard solar abundances @xmath35 for species @xmath2 : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , and a `` depleted '' set of abundances with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , describing the mean composition of the interstellar plasma with some elements frozen on dust grains as suggested first by ref .  .",
    "the results for the two sets are similar ; later only calculations for the `` depleted '' set are shown .",
    "we assume in this paper that the system gains the energy from photo - electrons produced by external ultraviolet radiation ionizing dust particles .",
    "non - thermal photoelectrons emitted by dust share their energy with thermal electrons of the plasma with the rate @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is determined by the external uv radiation flux , @xmath46 , and optical properties of the dust . in inelastic collisions with ions and neutrals",
    "the electrons lose their energy to excite internal degrees of freedom , which then decay radiatively . in the simplest case of an optically thin low - density plasma these energy losses by the electrons",
    "can , thus , be written as the sum of two processes : @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where we implicitly assumed that the thermal velocity of the electrons @xmath49 , so that in @xmath50 and @xmath51 only the dependence on @xmath52 is essential .",
    "in addition , the electrons can share their thermal energy in elastic collisions with the ions and neutrals .",
    "the coefficients are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . in total",

    "energy losses of the ions in inelastic collisions are small in comparison with energy exchange rates in elastic collisions , and these losses are normally neglected . in our calculations",
    "we included , however , these losses , assuming , according to ref .  , that the cross section for direct excitation by proton impact is broadly similar to the one by electron impact if the proton has the same velocity as the electron , with the only difference that the maximum cross section by proton impacts is a factor of 10 larger than that by electrons ( cf",
    "refs .  ) . with this assumption the derived form of the radiative cooling functions for the ions read as @xmath57 for the ion - ion inelastic collisions and @xmath58 for the collisions between the ions and neutrals , where we varied the factor @xmath0 from 1 to 10 .",
    "therefore , we adopt for the ions the generalized rate in the form    [ ion ] h_i&=&-l_i^i(t_i)n_i^2-l_a^i(t_i)n_an_i - q_d^i(t_i)t_in_in_d + & & -q_i^e(t_e)(t_i - t_e)n_in_e + & & -q_a^i(t_a , t_i)(t_i - t_a)n_in_a , where @xmath59 depends on both @xmath60 and @xmath61 and is given in refs .   and  ; @xmath62 describes cooling of the ions in elastic collisions with translationally cold dust particles  by the order of magnitude @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the mass ratio of the ions ( mainly protons ) to dust particles , @xmath65 the geometric cross - section of a dust particle , @xmath66 the thermal velocity of the ions , and is small compared to other terms in ( [ ion ] ) ; the second term on the r.h.s . describes radiative losses of the ions in collisions with neutrals ; the contribution of ion - ion inelastic collisions in a relatively weakly ionized plasma we deal with ( @xmath67 ) is small .",

    "@xmath97 the coefficients @xmath98 converge to @xmath99 , and therefore the sufficient condition for the instability is that the constant term in the polynomial ( [ disp1 ] ) in @xmath100 is negative .",

    "this suggests that the dust charge and correspondingly the fraction of the uv radiation transformed into gas heating are kept constant in the whole range of plasma parameters .",

    "we assume also a constant fractional ionization , @xmath109const .",
    "this assumption is justified by the fact that the instability growth time is expected to be of the order of the radiative cooling time , which is always shorter than the relaxation time for recombination ( see ref .  ) ; for conditions , e.g. , in the warm phase of the interstellar medium with @xmath14 k the radiative cooling time is @xmath110 s@xmath17 , while the recombination time is @xmath111 s@xmath17 .",

    "it is clearly seen that positively charged dust particles destabilize the system , widening the instability domain to higher temperatures where formally in one - fluid approximation @xmath123 .",
    "negative dust particles , shown in panel f ) , strongly stabilize the system even in the limit of small @xmath12  dust charges in the range @xmath124 $ ] give identically stability in the whole domain of the temperature - density plane shown in fig .",
    "1 . stabilization of the thermal instability by negatively charged dust can be understood as follows : due to the quasineutrality condition negative dust particles repel the electrons out of the compressed plasma , and thus the radiative cooling rate provided basically by the electrons decreases .",
    "only when dust charge is high in absolute value , @xmath125 , a narrow region at temperatures @xmath126 k , where the instability condition is fulfilled , does appear in the high density range as seen in figure 2 .    .",

    "the collisional frequency is multiplied by a factor of 0.01 ( a , b ) , 10 ( c , d ) , 20 ( e , f ) , 50 ( g , h ) , 100 ( i , j ) . ]",
    "this instability at high densities in turn seems to stem from a tighter collisional coupling between the electrons and ions .",
    "figure 3 shows the dependence of the instability domains in the temperature - density plane for an artificially enhanced rate of the elastic energy exchange between electrons and ions ; the left panel corresponds to positively charged grains , the right panel to negatively charged grains ; in both cases the dust charge is fixed at the level @xmath127 .",
    "it is readily seen that weakening of the elastic energy exchange in collisions between the electrons and ions results in a widening of the instability domain for positively charged grains ( left upper panel ) , and in a shrinking of the instability domain for negatively charged grains ( right upper panel ) .",
    "more frequent electron - ion collisions lead to a narrower instability domain for positive dust , while in the case of negative dust the instability domain widens with the collisional rate . in the limit of very high collisional frequencies ( increased by a factor of 100 with respect to the normal value ) the instability domains for positive and negative grains become almost identical .",
    "this means that the instability domain at high densities for negatively charged grains shown in figure 2 arises due to elastic interactions between the electrons and ions .",
    "the dependence of the instability domain on the density emerges from the fact that the energy exchange in elastic collisions between the species does not appear in the equilibrium energy equation because of the isothermality of the equilibrium @xmath128 , while in the instability criterion ( [ instab0 ] ) the derivatives of the elastic collisional rates over temperatures , proportional to the density square , do contribute ; at high densities this contribution becomes dominant .    for a constant dust charge @xmath12 variations of the uv radiation flux , @xmath46 , result in a simple shift of the instability domain and the equilibrium temperature curve along the @xmath18-axis ",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that at such an assumption the heating rate linearly depends on density @xmath18 , while the cooling rate is proportional to the square of density @xmath129 : the higher is @xmath46 the larger is the density needed for radiation losses to balance the heating at given temperature .",
    "this behavior may change to some extent when the dependence of dust charge on @xmath46 is accounted .",
    "the radiation - condensation ( thermal ) instability in a dusty plasma heated through photo - ionization of dust particles is described in a four - fluid approximation .",
    "it is shown that in this approximation with admitted separate motions of the species , the instability criterion changes dramatically compared to the standard one - fluid case . in particular , positively charged dust particles are found to destabilize the system , while negatively charged ones strongly stabilize perturbations : only in the limit @xmath130 negative dust leaves a relatively narrow domain of instability in the high density end , where elastic energy exchange between the electrons and ions dominates .    in the interstellar medium",
    "the dust charge in low - density regions ( diffuse neutral hi phase ) is positive due to photo - ionization by stellar ultraviolet light , cf .",
    "in the light of our results this means that low - density intercloud gas is highly unstable against the formation of condensations in the whole temperature range .",
    "a significant fraction of dust is also positive in denser regions , such as diffuse hi clouds and even in molecular clouds ( see ref .  ) .",
    "therefore , contrary to a common understanding that dense phases of the interstellar gas are stable against the formation of condensations , they turn out to be unstable when separated motions of the species are accounted .",
    "one may speak thus about possible fragmentation of interstellar clouds through the rc instability on smaller structures .",
