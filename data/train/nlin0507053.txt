    "diverse scientific disciplines cope with systems characterized by interactions across a large range of physically significant length scales .",
    "this is for instance the case of earthquake dynamics ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where the important spatial scales range from the small scale ( @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) , associated with friction , to the tectonic plate boundary scale ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the range of temporal scales goes from seconds ( during dynamic ruptures ) to @xmath3 years ( repeat times for earthquakes ) to @xmath4 years ( evolution of plate boundaries ) .",
    "many active scales are also encountered in biological and soft matter sciences .",
    "for instance , to understand the physics of a cell membrane , one starts from angstrom - sized atoms with motions in the femtosecond range , to go to the whole cell , whose diameters can be tens of micrometers and lifetimes of the order of days .",
    "all these scales can neither be probed by a single experimental technique , nor numerically resolved in a single simulation ( see e.g.  ref.@xcite ) .",
    "a similar situation can be found in the framework of atmospheric or ocean sciences .",
    "focusing on tracer dispersion , advection by geophysical flows results in the rapid generation of fine - scale tracer structures .",
    "this is true even though , e.g. in the atmosphere , the wind field is typically dominated by large scale features , such as synoptic scale weather systems .",
    "coarse - grained representations of atmospheric winds can indeed generate fine - scale tracer filaments , through the chaotic advection process ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a common and long - standing problem linking all these scientific disciplines is to build a coarse - grained description starting from the microscopic model .",
    "the challenge is thus to reduce the typically huge number of degrees of freedom by modeling the fastest and smallest scales . in this way",
    "one may construct a computationally tractable effective equation , which involves only the scales one is interest in @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to shed some light on this very general problem in the specific framework of tracers dispersion . in this context , the scales of interest are generally larger than the diffusive length - scale .",
    "the problem of developing coarse - grained models , closed on the large scales , is also known as `` parameterization problem '' @xcite . for general advecting velocity fields ,",
    "the parameterization problem is not tractable by means of systematic approaches able to deduce the form of the closure starting from the original , full - scale , equations .",
    "an important exception occurs in the presence of scale separation between the advecting velocity and the tracer i.e. , when the former is concentrated at small scales and one looks at the tracer dynamics on scales much larger than those of the velocity . in this limit",
    "the goal is to derive the expression of the asymptotic diffusion coefficient renormalized by the presence of the small scale velocity field .",
    "this can be accomplished exploiting asymptotic methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite among the others ) .",
    "however , in many physical circumstances one has that the velocity field may be though as a small - scale advecting velocity field ( at scale @xmath5 ) superimposed to a large - scale , slowly varying component ( at scale @xmath6 ) .",
    "a physical example of this situation is represented by the dispersion of a pollutant that , released in the atmospheric boundary layer ( having characteristic time scales of the order of minutes ) , is observed at synoptic scales ( i.e. over weeks or more ) .",
    "scale separation is guaranteed by the fact that meso - scale structures ( in the range between weeks and minutes ) turns out to be much less energetic than the other active scales ( see e.g.   ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this case",
    "two levels of coarse - grained description are of interest . as in the previous case",
    "one would like to understand the asymptotic diffusive regime at scales much larger than @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "one is also interested in deriving meso - scale models for the ( pre - asymptotic ) transport of a tracer in the range of scales between @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the latter issue has been recently addressed in refs .",
    "in particular , explicit expressions for the effective ( meso - scale ) diffusivity and velocity have been obtained in the limit of strong large scale flows @xcite .",
    "this investigation pointed out the important fact that the ( meso - scale ) diffusivity does depend on the large - scale advecting velocity , as well as ( of course ) on the small scales .",
    "our main aim here is to quantitatively understand whether or not the opposite limit ( i.e.  a large - scale advective component which is weaker than the small - scale advection ) leads to explicit expressions for the effective parameters which functionally depend on the large - scale advecting velocity .",
    "as we shall see , a class of eddy - diffusivity fields will emerge from a perturbative approach through which both the asymptotic and the pre - asymptotic transport properties can be successfully described when the effects of the large scales are properly taken into account .",
    "in particular , by means of numerical simulations of model flows we show that the meso - scale transport model is able not only to recover the asymptotic properties but also to predict the pre - asymptotic regime .",
    "the latter issue is conceptually connected with the predictability problem of the second kind @xcite , where the goal is to predict the evolution of the system through a model in which not all the degrees of freedom are resolved .    for the sake of simplicity our analysis will be restricted to two - dimensional flows .",
    "it should be noted that working in two - dimensions is still relevant to many applications , e.g. , to investigate the time - varying transport and mixing properties of isentropic flows in the atmosphere ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and in the ocean in connection with horizontal geostrophic eddies ( see e.g. ref .",

    "( [ eq:13 ] ) we can finally write the following polynomial expansion in @xmath60 for the eddy diffusivity : @xmath61 where we denoted with @xmath62 the eddy diffusivity originating from the small - scale velocity field when the large - scale one is neglected , i.e. : @xmath63 it is important to note that the coefficients @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 denotes the convolution integral ) are determined only by the small - scale flow characteristics .",
    "we remark that this approach is relevant also in those cases in which direct ( analytical or numerical ) computation of these coefficients is not possible , since they can be guessed on an empirical ground .",

    "these are determined solely by the small - scale features : @xmath82 in the general three - dimensional case the transverse correction @xmath83 pertains to the plane perpendicular to the direction of the large - scale flow .",
    "let us now discuss the approximation previously obtained in two model flows . as representative examples of two broad classes of realistic instances we focus here on two large - scale flows : case @xmath84 : a steady shear , the kolmogorov flow  @xcite @xmath85 and case @xmath86 : a large - scale cellular flow  @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is their characteristic length - scale .",
    "the two above fields correspond to two typical situations : the shear flow strongly enhances the large - scale diffusion coefficient ( in the shear direction ) , while the cellular flow ( due to trapping ) is characterized by a weaker enhancement of the diffusivity .    concerning the small - scale velocity component we consider a small scale replica of the cellular flow ( [ eq:3.27 ] ) , i.e. : @xmath89 with characteristic length - scale given by @xmath90 and amplitude @xmath91 .",

    "let us now discuss the effect on the eddy diffusivity tensor induced by a weak large scale flow .    in order to estimate the second - order correction and to assess the limits of validity of truncating the perturbative expansion at second order in @xmath99",

    "the full auxiliary eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) is solved for various choices of @xmath53 . as already stated , the coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath83 defined in eq .",

    "qualitatively similar results have been obtained for other sets of parameters .    however , since the small - scale cellular flow is not exactly isotropic .",
