    "the dominance of the neutron - proton attraction is one of the main characteristics of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "it can be traced back to the isospin symmetry of the force and to the cooperation of the and channels . as a result ,",
    "isovector collective modes have a much higher excitation energy than their isoscalar counterparts .",
    "on the other hand , the study of nuclei away from the stability line has led to the discovery of phenomena ( halo and molecular nuclei , reorganization of the shell structure ) which challenge some of the standard nuclear structure concepts .",
    "these new perspectives have been mostly provided by the analysis of neutron - rich nuclei which , because of the relative weakening of coulomb effects , give the best opportunities to investigate dynamics far away from the line .",
    "the new phenomena are partly attributed to a decoupling of the two nucleonic distributions when @xmath4 exceeds @xmath5 by far",
    ". another cause invoked is the weak binding of the last occupied neutrons in the absence of a barrier . aside from new features of ground - state properties ,",
    "also some interesting effects , such as pigmy resonances , have been observed which are clear indications that the excitation of isovector modes is easier in neutron - rich isotopes than in stable nuclei .",
    "the pigmy modes are associated with dipolar excitations involving a restricted number of nucleons and partly for this reason , carrying a small fraction of the sum rule only .",
    "they also correspond to collective vibrations . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the low - energy collective structure remains dominated by isoscalar large amplitude quadrupole dynamics , leading in many regions of the nuclear chart to ground state deformations .",
    "the strong proton shell closure at and the already good experimental knowledge of the complete oxygen isotope series from @xmath6o up to the drip line at @xmath7o @xcite makes oxygen an attractive element for a first investigation ( not to mention that the theoretical analysis is significantly simplified in light systems ) . in fact , the experimental effort on these isotopes has spurred a number of analysis based either on the mean - field method  @xcite or on the shell model  @xcite .",
    "mean - field investigations of collective dynamics properties have up to now exclusively concerned excitations about the lowest configuration which always correspond to zero mass quadrupole moment .",
    "an important result from both experimental and theoretical works is the weakening of the shell effect ( both @xmath8o and @xmath9o are not bound  @xcite ) along with evidences for a local subshell predicted sometimes at  @xcite or at  @xcite .    for these reasons",
    ", we have chosen to investigate in a consistent way the effect of large neutron excess on both isoscalar and isovector quadrupole modes of the oxygen isotopes .",
    "this first article presents our method and gives an illustration for the nucleus @xmath2o . in order to treat small- and large - amplitude collective motion on the same footing",
    ", we perform our analysis within the framework of the projected generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite based on hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) wave functions .",
    "a consistent simultaneous treatment of isovector and isoscalar dynamics is attempted by working in a gcm collective space in which neutron and proton deformations are allowed to vary independently .",
    "let us briefly summarize the different steps involved in the projected configuration mixing calculation ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .    in the gcm , the collective dynamics",
    "is constrained by the choice of a variational space , the so - called collective space . for the present study ,",
    "this space is generated by a non - orthogonal basis of particle - number and angular - momentum projected hfb states .",
    "the hfb states are obtained from self - consistent calculations using either a single constraint on the axial mass quadrupole moment , or a double constraint acting separately on the axial neutron and proton quadrupole moments .",
    "the resulting hfb states are denoted @xmath10 , where @xmath11 labels the collective variables . in the case of a single constraint ,",
    "@xmath11 is identified with the expectation value @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamics will be studied along only one collective dimension , the total deformation .",
    "the relative contributions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 to the total quadrupole moment @xmath15 are then entirely determined by the chfb minimization process . in the case of double contraint ,",
    "the proton @xmath16 and neutron @xmath17 quadrupole moments are taken as independent constraints , and the collective variable @xmath11 becomes two - dimensional , @xmath18 .",
    "as in our previous studies  @xcite , the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) prescription is used to avoid a spurious collapse of pairing correlations in the hfb wave functions for all values of the quadrupole moment .",
    "the hfb - ln equations are solved with the two - basis method described in ref .",
    "the hfb states are chosen to be time - reversal invariant , and the single - particle states are eigenstates of parity , @xmath19 signature , and projection of isospin as in ref .",
    "they are represented on @xmath20 of a cubic mesh of size 11.6 fm with a distance of 0.8 fm between mesh points .",
    "we use the effective skyrme interaction sly4 in the particle - hole channel @xcite together with a surface - peaked density - dependent zero - range force acting in the particle - particle ( pairing ) channel .",
    "its strength is taken equal to @xmath21 mev @xmath22 in connection with two soft cutoffs at 5 mev above and below the fermi energies as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the one - body potentials associated with the standard axial quadrupole operator @xmath23 have a numerically pathological behavior at large distances .",
    "indeed , depending on whether the deformation is prolate or oblate , the constraining field decreases as @xmath24 along the @xmath19 axis or in the perpendicular plane , respectively .",
    "when solving the mean - field equations on a mesh in coordinate space , the finite size of the mesh cuts the constraint at large distances , but there always remain attractive pockets at the boundaries of the box , which will either distort the single - particle states around the continuum threshold , or even bind them .",
    "as soon as these states have a sizable occupation , as it happens in neutron - rich systems , this will often lead to spurious results .",
    "the large box sizes that have to be chosen in neutron - rich systems as discussed here even amplify the problem ; hence , the constraint has to be damped at large distances from the nucleus .",
    "we achieve this by multiplying the constraining operator with a fermi function as proposed in ref .",
    "we first define an equidensity surface on which the nucleon density @xmath25 is equal to one tenth of the maximal density @xmath26 .",
    "the cutoff takes place smoothly over a width equal to @xmath27 for radii exceeding the surface by a distance @xmath28 .    the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath27 have to be selected such that they do not affect the results over the range of considered deformations .",
    "the main role is played by the cutoff distance @xmath28 which we have set to 5.5 fm , slightly larger than the recommended value of ref .",
    "@xcite , while the width parameter was set to fm .",
    "the second step of our method is the construction of the collective basis @xmath29 by means of projection operators , where @xmath30 restores the rotational invariance broken by the intrinsic deformation of the nucleus and provides a state with the good total angular momentum @xmath31 .",
    "as we consider only axial deformations with the @xmath19 axis as symmetry axis , the projection of the third angular momentum component @xmath32 in the intrinsic frame is equal to zero by construction .",
    "we limit our study to values of the total angular momentum @xmath31 equal to zero and two .    in the next stage , we construct collective wave functions from a linear combination of projected states @xmath33 the weights @xmath34 of the projected hfb states are determined from the minimization of the total energy @xmath35 the index @xmath36 has been introduced to label the several solutions of the minimization equation which we will assign to the gcm ground state and to excited states for each angular momentum @xmath31 .",
    "the variation of the energy ( ) leads to the hill - wheeler - griffin equation @xmath37 its solution requires to compute the off - diagonal matrix elements of the energy and overlap kernels @xmath38 which are evaluated with the techniques described in @xcite .",
    "the calculation of electromagnetic transition of order @xmath39 requires an additional evaluation of the projected gcm kernels associated with the electric and magnetic tensor operators @xmath40}$ ] : @xmath41j'}_{q q ' } =   \\langle j m q |   \\hat{t}^{[l,0 ] } | j ' m ' q ' \\rangle , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath39 and @xmath42 satisfy the triangle inequalities .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "first , aside from restoring the symmetries broken at the mean - field level , the projection also performs a transformation from the intrinsic to the laboratory frame . as a consequence ,",
    "every state @xmath43 is _ spherical _ in the laboratory frame of reference irrespective of the intrinsic quadrupole deformation associated with the collective variable @xmath11 .",
    "second , the coefficients @xmath44 are directly connected to the collective wave - function @xmath45 which provide informations on the spreading of this wave function over the collective space spanned by the variable(s ) @xmath11 .",
    "a set of orthogonal collective wave functions @xmath45 is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents the kernel whose square convolution gives @xmath48 .",
    "numerically speaking , the gcm calculations are quite demanding . given the number of grid points selected on the @xmath49 surface ( about 25 ) , the number of gauge angles to restore the particle numbers ( 7 for both protons and neutrons ) and the number of euler required for an accurate angular - momentum projection ( 12 ) , each calculation corresponds to the mixing of about 15 thousand @xmath4-body wave functions .",
    "an additional difficulty is related the non - orthogonality of the gcm basis that generates near - zero eigenvalues of the overlap kernel @xmath50 , which might lead to spurious states .",
    "these difficulties are treated with techniques described in refs .",

    "] as there is no unambiguous way to plot a two - dimensional wave function for the distribution of basis states we have used here , we will not attempt to do so , but restrict the further discussion to the observables calculated from it . however , we can state that when adding states with a different proton - to - neutron ratio of the deformation to one - dimensional path from the constraint on the mass quadrupole moment , the dominating contribution to the lowest and gcm states always remains the state with @xmath90 located on the one - dimensional path .    the @xmath74 energy surface ( bottom part of fig .  [ esurface ] )",
    "is split into two wells in the fully prolate and oblate sectors ( upper right and lower left quadrants ) . in the prolate sector",
    "the energy surface is markedly deeper .",
    "this is a good indication that the collective dynamics will favor a prolate deformation of the first @xmath74 state .",
    "the minimum on this surface is shifted to the region where the neutron deformation is larger than the proton deformation .",
    "this agrees with qrpa calculations  @xcite , as well as with experimental evidences  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the first @xmath74 level are summarized in table  [ table2plus ] .    in an attempt to systematically add states that cover the whole @xmath91-@xmath92 plane to the one - dimensional calculation depicted in fig .",
    "[ isoscalarwf ] , it turns out that the gcm basis becomes quickly highly redundant , which is reflected by the presence of several small eigenvalues of the norm kernel . to avoid spurious states which would lead to large numerical inaccuracies on energies and transition probabilities , one must avoid a very dense and regular two - dimensional mesh .",
    "this problem is particularly pronounced in a light nucleus as @xmath2o , in which a scmf wave function changes very slowly with deformation , but becomes more marginal for nuclei beyond the @xmath93 shell .",
    "therefore , one has to make several calculations with different choices for the set of scmf states , and use the variational principle to select the mesh giving the lowest energies without giving rise to spurious contributions .",
    "the uncertainty given in table  [ table2plus ] is a measure of the fluctuations of the results when using a different set of points in the @xmath49 space before entering a zone of numerical instability .",
    "it is noteworthy that the @xmath94 value ( and its equivalent for the neutron density distribution ) fluctuate much more in dependence of the chosen set of scmf states than the total energies of the first @xmath73 and @xmath74 states .",

    "the experimental value is overestimated by 1.4  mev .",
    "this discrepancy is in the range of values observed in a global study of the properties of the first @xmath74 states in even - even nuclei  @xcite , performed with a method similar to the one used .",
    "the possible origins of this discrepancy are also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for @xmath2o , they are presumably twofold .",
    "the variational calculation would be improved for the lowest @xmath74 state if it was constructed from a @xmath102 cranked constrained set of wave functions rather than from @xmath103 set as is done here .",
    "there is also a lack of broken - pair two - quasiparticle components breaking time reversal invariance in the variational space , which should play a role in this semi - magic nucleus , see the discussion of chains of heavier semi - magic nuclei in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in disagreement with the global trend found by sabbey _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the @xmath94 value is in much worse agreement with the data than the excitation energy .",
    "the effect of a larger variational space from a double constraint is even going in the wrong direction , leading to an overestimation of the @xmath94 value by a factor 6 .",
    "the value of the ratio between neutron and proton transition matrix elements is @xmath104 .",
    "this is less than the experimental or the qrpa values calculated with the same force  @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the protons follow too closely the neutrons when deforming the nucleus , which leads to the too large @xmath94 value that we obtain .",
    "since the qrpa value for the @xmath94 obtained with the same effective interaction is much larger , this probably points out to a deficiency of our variational space rather than to a problem due to the effective interaction .",
    "the presence of broken - pair two - quasiparticle states breaking time - reversal invariance in the @xmath74 wave function could reduce the @xmath94 value and go into the right direction , but the present stage of our method does not allow to test the magnitude of this effect .",
    "we have started an investigation of the large - amplitude quadrupole dynamics in neutron - rich nuclei taking into account the full isospin space . among our initial motivation was the search for stable configurations in which neutron and proton display different static deformation .",
    "our results indicate that it is indeed the case when the usual dimensionless deformations @xmath57 and @xmath58 are used to remove the trivial scaling of the quadrupole moments with neutron and proton number .",
    "we have also looked for signs of a dynamical isospin instability which would show up in specific spectroscopic properties . at a qualitative level",
    ", we observe the importance of allowing independent proton and neutron deformation : although the main features of the collective wave functions are still the same as those determined by the one - dimensional dynamics , the full wave function displays a significant extension on both sides of this path .",
    "similarly , there is a clear influence on the transition moments .",
    "unfortunately , the agreement with the experimental data is not satisfactory for this light nucleus . our model",
    "would probably be improved by enlarging the variational space for the @xmath74 state with the inclusion of states breaking time - reversal invariance . the developments which will allow this inclusion are still underway .",

    "<S> by means of hfb calculations with independent constraints on axial neutron and proton quadrupole moments @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we investigate the large amplitude isoscalar and isovector deformation properties of the neutron - rich isotope @xmath2o . using the particle - number and angular - momentum projected generator coordinate method </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the collective dynamics in the @xmath3 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the parameterization sly4 of the skyrme interaction is used for all calculations in connection with a density - dependent zero - range pairing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that already for this moderately neutron - rich nucleus the transition moments are modified when independent neutron and proton collective dynamics are allowed . </S>"
