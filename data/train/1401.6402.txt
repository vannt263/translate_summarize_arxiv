    "in its simplest terms a liquid crystal material is viewed as a fluid consisting of a large number of molecules , identical in shape but with potentially different orientations in 3-dimensional space that affect their mutual interactions .",
    "a molecule will tend to change its orientation in @xmath3 under the influence of other molecules and/or external forces .",
    "the resulting changes in optical properties of a liquid crystal sample are the key to the currently ubiquitous liquid crystal display technology  @xcite .",
    "equilibrium states or _ phases _ of a liquid crystal are typically modelled as critical points of a a suitable _ free energy _",
    "function defined on a space of _ order parameters _ that measure the degree and nature of alignment of the molecules .",
    "stable states correspond to absolute minima of the free energy . in the paper",
    "@xcite updated in @xcite the authors set out a molecular field theory formalism for a free energy function for spatially homogeneous uniaxial and biaxial nematic liquid crystals . in this formalism",
    "the free energy has two components : a molecular interaction term ( typically quadratic ) and an entropy term .",
    "the main focus is on a small number of order parameters as typically used in the liquid crystal literature , but in an appendix to  @xcite and section  iii of  @xcite they indicate how to generalise to an arbitrary number of order parameters . in  @xcite the formalism",
    "is put into practice through the calculation of leading terms in the taylor series for the free energy function close to isotropy in terms of four standard order parameters widely used in studies of biaxiality ( with equally widely varying notation : see  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe the model ( which , following the authors in  @xcite , we call the kkls model ) in a general coordinate - free geometric setting which makes evident the natural symmetry group of the free energy function .",
    "in particular we note that the symmetry group @xmath4 of the entropy term is larger than is commonly supposed in the literature .",
    "we then specialise to the more familiar setting in which the space of molecular variables is @xmath5-dimensional ( the space @xmath6 of @xmath7 real symmetric traceless matrices or @xmath8-_tensors _ ) which gives rise to a @xmath9-dimensional space of order parameters ( _ supertensors _ ) , namely the space @xmath10 of linear transformations @xmath11 .    to study the critical point behaviour of a real - valued function on @xmath10 that is invariant under the action of the appropriate group @xmath4 it is natural to turn to the classical theory of invariants and to seek a hilbert basis ( also called an integrity basis ) for these functions , that is a finite set of @xmath4-invariant polynomials in terms of which all other @xmath4-invariant functions @xmath12 can be expressed . here",
    "this is too ambitious a task , although elsewhere  @xcite we are able to exhibit the molien generating function that counts the number of such ( independent ) polynomials at each degree .",
    "fortunately , there are two reductions of the problem that by different routes lead to essentially equivalent simplifications from 25 dimensions to precisely two .",
    "as we show , the bifurcations of equilibria from the isotropic phase ( no mutual alignment ) take place in a @xmath5-dimensional subspace isomorphic to @xmath6 with the natural symmetry group @xmath13 acting by conjugacy . for unusual group - theoretic reasons",
    "the study of @xmath13-invariant functions on @xmath6 is no different from the study of @xmath14-invariant functions on @xmath2 , which therefore suffices for the analysis of uniaxial and biaxial bifurcation from isotropy .",
    "this is the setting for the classical landau - de  gennes theory of phase transitions for biaxial nematic liquid crystals  @xcite , naturally much studied in the literature : a thorough and careful mathematical analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the common assumption can be made that at equilibrium the ensemble average over @xmath4 of a matrix @xmath15 has the same eigenframe as @xmath8 , an assumption supported by physical intuition but so far lacking a rigorous proof in the present context . with this assumption the @xmath5-dimensional space @xmath6 reduces to the @xmath16-dimensional space @xmath17 of traceless diagonal @xmath7 matrices , so then @xmath18 is @xmath19-dimensional and is the space of @xmath19 order parameters familiar in studies of biaxial liquid crystals .",
    "again , we show that bifurcation from isotropy occurs in a @xmath16-dimensional subspace with the natural @xmath14 action , thus leading again to the landau - de  gennes formulation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is first to clarify the nature of order parameters and free energy functions for liquid crystals , and in particular their symmetries , within the wider context of group representation theory , and then to invoke ideas and techniques from equivariant singularity theory to provide rigorous results on robustness of the bifurcation scenario , including precise criteria for the safe neglect of higher order terms .",
    "many of the results in the literature on bifurcation of uniaxial and biaxial equilibria , and in particular those described for the kkls model in  @xcite , can be interpeted and their simplifying assumptions and approximations tested within this universal framework . in carrying out the reduction from four order parameters to the two that govern the bifurcations from isotropy",
    ", we are able to give explicit expressions for the coefficients of the universal model in terms of those calculated numerically for the specific kkls free energy function on @xmath20 in  @xcite . for an overview of the mathematical and physical assumptions that lie behind the kkls and related models together with notes on the historical context and many key literature references we defer to  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ s : algebra ]",
    "we introduce some of the basic formalism of group actions ( representations ) and invariant functions .",
    "section  [ s : kklsmodel ] describes the kkls model and its symmetries . in section  [ s : classprog ]",
    "the general ( if unfeasible ) classification programme of equilibria for the kkls model is formulated , redeemed by a result that allows drastic dimension - reduction when treating bifurcation from isotropy .",
    "section  [ s : reducedmodels ] sets out notation for the reduced kkls model with four order parameters , presenting a hilbert basis for the functions invariant under the natural symmetry characterised by the action of a @xmath21-element group . in section  [ s : expandf ] the taylor series of the free energy",
    "is considered up to degree  @xmath22 , and its explicit conversion to the sum of a nondegenerate quadratic from in two variables plus a residual function in two other variables is carried out up to degree  @xmath23 ( for comparison with kkls data from  @xcite ) at a general point of instability of the isotropic state .",
    "finally , section  [ s : bifnormal ] gives a bifurcation analysis for the normal form of the residual function in terms of the geometry of the familiar swallowtail for uniaxial equilibria and a less familiar configuration for biaxial equilibria .",
    "there are four appendices giving technical results needed in the main text .    among the aims of the programme on _ the mathematics of liquid crystals _ hosted at the isaac newton institute , cambridge in 2013 was to encourage mathematicians familiar with techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory and singularity theory to engage with the wealth of interesting and important problems arising in the study of liquid crystals , while at the same time alerting experts in liquid crystals to the availability of these powerful mathematical tools .",
    "it is hoped that this paper may contribute to the cultural exchange .",
    "_ remarks on terminology and notation_.    in this paper we use notation that characterises a group as an abstract object ( up to isomorphism ) , while in much of the liquid crystal literature a group name represents an abstract group together with a specified _",
    "action _ of that group on euclidean space ( schnflies notation ) .",
    "see  @xcite for a thorough discussion of this and related issues .    in the bifurcation theory literature",
    "it is important to distinguish between the _ variables _ that are to be measured , and the _ parameters _ which are the coefficients of the governing equations and can in principle be controlled .",
    "this is a potential source of confusion in liquid crystal theory where the variables are the _ order parameters_.",
    "we begin by setting out some basic facts about group actions and invariant functions .",
    "let @xmath4 denote a finite or , more generally , a compact lie group ( such as the rotation group @xmath24 ) , and let @xmath25 denote an _ action _ of @xmath4 on a linear space @xmath26 .",
    "this means that to every element @xmath27 there is an associated invertible linear map @xmath28 such that group multiplication corresponds to composition of linear maps : for all @xmath29 we have @xmath30 with the usual understanding ( not shared by algebraists ) that the right - hand map is applied first . a linear action",
    "is also called a _ representation_. the action @xmath25 is _ absolutely irreducible _ if the only elements of @xmath31 that commute with @xmath32 for all @xmath27 are the scalar multiples of the identity map . in particular",
    "this implies that no proper linear subspace @xmath33 is @xmath25-invariant ( i.e. mapped into itself ) by all @xmath32 for @xmath27 . for any @xmath34 the _ orbit _ of @xmath35 under the action",
    "@xmath25 is the set @xmath36 , that is the set of all points in @xmath26 to which @xmath35 is taken by the action @xmath25 of @xmath4 ( the partners of @xmath35 under the @xmath4-symmetry @xmath25 ) .",
    "the notion of different actions of the same group is familiar in quantum mechanics , for example , where for a given @xmath37 the @xmath38 matrix @xmath39 denotes the effect of @xmath40 as a natural linear transformation in @xmath41 dimensions : see for example  @xcite,@xcite . of course any group @xmath4 can act _ trivially _ on any space @xmath26 by taking @xmath32 to be the identity transformation of @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .",
    "given an action @xmath25 of @xmath4 on @xmath26 there are three natural actions of @xmath4 on the linear space @xmath31 of linear maps @xmath42 arising from @xmath25 : the _ left action _",
    "@xmath43 in which @xmath27 takes @xmath44 to @xmath45 , the _ right action _",
    "@xmath46 in which @xmath40 takes @xmath47 to @xmath48 ( the inversion is to ensure that ( [ e : action ] ) holds in the correct order ) , and the combined _ conjugacy action _",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 for each @xmath27 the conjugacy transformation ( [ e : conj ] ) is a _ linear _ map from @xmath31 to @xmath31 ; thus @xmath51 .",
    "when a basis is chosen for @xmath26 , elements of @xmath31 are represented by matrices ( or tensors ) @xmath52 , and elements of @xmath53 by _ supertensors _ @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath26 is equipped with a scalar product ( inner product ) denoted by @xmath55 then associated to every @xmath56 is the _ dual _ linear map @xmath57 defined by @xmath58 for every @xmath59 . in terms of ( real ) matrices this is simply the _ transpose _ , and the map @xmath56 is _ symmetric _ if @xmath60 .",
    "we denote the set of symmetric elements of @xmath31 by @xmath61 , and the subset of those with _ zero trace _ by @xmath62 .",
    "the linear map @xmath56 is _ orthogonal _ if @xmath63 is the identity map , so that @xmath64 preserves the scalar product on @xmath26 .",
    "the action @xmath25 is _ orthogonal _ if @xmath65 is orthogonal for every @xmath27 , in which case @xmath66 for every @xmath27 and @xmath59 . by a standard process of averaging",
    "it is easy to show that an inner product can always be chosen to make a given action @xmath25 orthogonal : see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem ii(1.7 ) ) or  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.4.3 ) for example .",
    "this greatly simplifies the handling of matrices describing symmetries .",
    "in particular , if @xmath25 is orthogonal then @xmath61 and @xmath62 are preserved by the conjugacy action  @xmath67 on @xmath31 .    a natural scalar product on the space @xmath31 arises from that on @xmath26 and given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes _",
    "trace_. the following identities are easily verified :    [ p : trace ] @xmath70 for all @xmath71 .",
    "a further elementary result is important for our purposes :    [ p : inner ] if the action @xmath25 on @xmath26 is orthogonal then the action @xmath67 on @xmath31 is also orthogonal .    by definition @xmath72",
    "using proposition [ p : trace ] and the fact that @xmath73 by orthogonality .",
    "a real - valued function @xmath74 is said to be _ invariant _ under the action @xmath25 of @xmath4 on @xmath26 when it is the case that @xmath75 for all @xmath27 and all @xmath34 .",
    "it is a classical theorem due to hilbert that if @xmath4 is finite or compact then there is a finite set of @xmath4-invariant polynomials ( a _ hilbert basis _ or _",
    "integrity basis _ ) such that every @xmath4-invariant polynomial function on @xmath26 can be expressed as a polynomial function of these basic polynomials .",
    "this result was extended by schwarz @xcite to show that every @xmath4-invariant smooth ( i.e. @xmath76 ) function on @xmath26 can be expressed as a smooth function of the polynomials in a hilbert basis .",
    "thus , for example , every smooth function @xmath77 invariant under the conjugacy action of @xmath13 can be written as a smooth function of the two invariants @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath15 .",
    "this result , well known in liquid crystal theory , follows as a simple application of a powerful and elegant general technique in invariant theory that we now describe for later use .",
    "the hilbert basis for a given group action is not unique , and finding one in practice can be a considerable challenge  @xcite .",
    "however , a valuable tool exists enabling us to calculate in advance how many elements a hilbert basis will have .",
    "molien series _",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite for the given action @xmath25 of @xmath4 on @xmath26 is a formal power series @xmath80 where the coefficient @xmath81 is the number of linearly independent @xmath4-invariant polynomial functions on @xmath26 of homogeneous degree @xmath82 .",
    "remarkably , in the case of a finite group @xmath4 there is an explicit expression for @xmath83 as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of elements in @xmath4 , with an analogous expression for an infinite compact group using an integral rather than a sum .",
    "furthermore , the series @xmath83 is expressible as a rational function which gives more detailed information about the algebraic relationships between the invariants  @xcite,@xcite .    * * example**__action of @xmath14 on @xmath2 _ _    the molien function  ( [ e : molien ] ) for the natural action @xmath86 of @xmath14 on @xmath2 as the symmetries of an equilateral triangle is easily found to be @xmath87 which conveys the information that a hilbert basis consists of one polynomial of degree  @xmath16 and one of degree  @xmath88 , there being no algebraic relation between them as the terms @xmath89 appear only in the denominator . for suitable coordinates in @xmath2 the basis elements may be taken to be @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    * * example**__action of @xmath13 on @xmath92 _ _    an element @xmath93 is a @xmath94 orthogonal matrix with eigenvalues @xmath95 for some angle @xmath96 , and for the conjugacy action @xmath67 the eigenvalues of @xmath97 are @xmath98 . to evaluate the molien series using the integral version of the formula  ( [ e : molien ] ) we make use of the weyl integral formula ( as described in  @xcite for example ) which shows that such an integral",
    "can be decomposed into an integral over a _",
    "maximal torus _ in @xmath4 and over the quotient of the group by this torus . in the case",
    "when the integrand is a class function ( invariant under conjugation in the group ) then the latter integral becomes trivial , and the whole integral reduces to an integral over the maximal torus only , at the cost of introducing a further term into the integrand that we call the _",
    "weyl factor_. the integral over the circle is expressed in terms of angular variables and can be evaluated using residue calculus .    in our case",
    "the maximal torus is a circle given by the matrices @xmath99 for @xmath100 , and integration is over the unit circle regarded as the circle @xmath101 in the complex plane .",
    "the weyl factor can be found to be @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and so the molien integral  ( [ e : molien ] ) for @xmath67 becomes @xmath103 since the aim is to find @xmath104 as an infinite series in @xmath105 we regard @xmath105 as a small real variable and in any case with @xmath106 , this restriction to be exploited when evaluating residues . in our case",
    "the relevant residues are at @xmath107 and at @xmath108 and easy calculations give @xmath109 which shows that the ring of @xmath67-invariant functions on @xmath6 has two generators of homogeneous degree  @xmath110 respectively .",
    "these may be taken to be @xmath111 although the latter could be replaced by @xmath112 since the cayley - hamilton equation shows that @xmath113 when @xmath114 .",
    "it is no coincidence that the molien function @xmath104 coincides with that of the natural representation @xmath86 of @xmath14 on @xmath2 .",
    "this is because of special properties of @xmath67 : every @xmath67-invariant function on @xmath6 is uniquely determined by its values on the @xmath16-dimensional subspace @xmath17 of @xmath6 consisting of diagonal matrices , and the @xmath115-orbit of a point in @xmath17 is precisely the intersection of its @xmath67 orbit with  @xmath17 .",
    "we now turn to the main focus of this paper which is the kkls model  @xcite for the construction of a free energy function on an appropriate space of order parameters . following  @xcite",
    "we begin with the key assumption that properties of a molecule relevant to its interactions with its neighbours are characterised by an @xmath116-tuple of real numbers ( orientational order or shape parameters ) @xmath117 , and that each element @xmath118 of the rotation group @xmath13 when applied to a given molecule induces a linear transformation @xmath119 of @xmath120 that is a measure of the interaction between a molecule and its rotated counterpart .",
    "this places us immediately in the mathematical setting of an action @xmath25 of @xmath121 on @xmath122 as discussed in section  [ s : actions ] , although given @xmath123 we write @xmath124 rather than @xmath119 . here and throughout we assume homogeneity of the medium , so that local properties of the liquid crystal are the same everywhere and spatial derivatives of @xmath125 do not come into play .",
    "a well - established technique to finesse the intractable task of calculating mutual interactions of huge numbers of molecules is to apply instead a _",
    "mean field theory _ where each particular molecule is seen as reacting to the _ average _ influence of all the other molecules . evaluating",
    "this average corresponds to integrating @xmath126 with respect to an appropriate probability distribution on the group @xmath13 , this being determined by the relevant physical theory .",
    "the components of the average @xmath127 with respect to a suitably chosen basis for @xmath120 are the _ order parameters _ for the liquid crystal .    in an equilibrium state",
    "the alignment of a particular molecule must necessarily be consistent with the creation of the mean field in the first place , thus posing a significant mathematical problem .",
    "we first formulate this problem in a general coordinate - free setting , while following the paradigm of  @xcite , and we then apply it in the context of molecules with effective @xmath128 symmetry ( schnflies notation ) or @xmath129 symmetry ( algebraic notation ) where each @xmath130 factor acts by rotation through angle @xmath131 about one of the coordinate axes .",
    "as far as interactions are concerned the molecule can be represented by an ellipsoid whose departure from sphericity is given by a real symmetric traceless @xmath7 _ susceptibility matrix _ @xmath132 , therefore @xmath133 . as we shall see , however , further assumptions can often be made that enable reduction to much lower dimensions .    in the kkls and other models for equilibrium states ( phases ) of liquid crystals",
    ", an equilibrium corresponds to a critical point of a suitable _ free energy _",
    "function on the space of order parameters , with stable phases corresponding to global or absolute minima .",
    "the kkls model is characterised by the fact that the free energy has two components : a molecular interaction or _",
    "hamiltonian _ term and an _ entropy _ term .",
    "we focus first on the latter and return afterwards to the former .",
    "we follow the general formulation of  @xcite , expressed here in the more abstract context of section  [ s : actions ] .",
    "consider an arbitrary compact group @xmath4 with orthogonal action @xmath25 on a linear space @xmath26 , together with a probability distribution @xmath134 on @xmath4 expressed in terms of the action @xmath25 : thus @xmath134 has the form @xmath135 for some suitable @xmath136 which we assume smooth .",
    "there are two important physical quantities to be derived from @xmath134 .",
    "the first is the _ ensemble average _",
    "@xmath137 which represents the average @xmath25-action of @xmath27 with respect to the particular probability distribution @xmath134 , the integral being taken over the natural normalised invariant ( haar ) measure on @xmath4 .",
    "this is a quantity that in principle might be measured in the laboratory , whereas the probability distribution itself could not . if @xmath138 then the @xmath139 entries of @xmath140 ( with respect to a chosen basis ) are the _ order parameters _ describing the state of this system .",
    "the second quantity derived from @xmath134 is the _ entropy _ ( more accurately , the _ entropy difference _ between the isotropic state characterised by the uniform probability distribution on @xmath4 and the state given by @xmath134 ) , defined by @xmath141 where @xmath142 is boltzmann s constant .    following the kkls methodology  @xcite the probability distribution @xmath134",
    "is now chosen in such as way as to maximise the entropy , given the ( observed ) value of @xmath143 .",

    "<S> we use tools and methods of equivariant singularity theory to reduce the bifurcation study to that of a @xmath1-invariant function on @xmath2 , ubiquitous in liquid crystal theory , and to describe the universal bifurcation geometry in terms of the superposition of a familiar swallowtail controlling uniaxial equilibria and another less familiar surface controlling biaxial equilibria . in principle </S>",
    "<S> this provides a template for _ all _ nematic liquid crystal phase transitions close to isotropy , although further work is needed to identify the absolute minima that are the critical points representing stable phases .    </S>",
