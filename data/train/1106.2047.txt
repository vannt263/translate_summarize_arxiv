    "a combination of gravitational focusing and dynamical friction brings rapid growth of large bodies , which is referred to as runaway growth @xcite .",
    "eventually , the runaway growth generates a small population of large bodies called planetary embryos .",
    "planetary embryos keep their orbital separations and hence grow through collisions with surrounding remnant planetesimals more slowly than in the runaway mode @xcite .",
    "this regime is called oligarchic growth .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the oligarchic growth halts due to fragmentation of planetesimals . in the oligarchic growth ,",
    "the relative velocities of planetesimals are controlled by the viscous stirring of embryos and gas drag .",
    "as embryos grow , the velocities of remnant planetesimals are increased so greatly that collisions between planetesimals become destructive .",
    "such collisions eject numerous fragments , which collide with each other to produce further smaller bodies .",
    "planetesimals are therefore ground down through such successive collisions ( collision cascade ) .",
    "the random velocities of small bodies are strongly damped by gas drag and thereby the collisional cascade no longer occurs for fragments with radii @xmath3@xmath4 . in the end",
    "such fragments drift inward due to gas drag and are lost around embryos .",
    "the collisional cascade combined with the loss of fragments reduces the solid surface density and hence final embryo masses .",
    "@xcite showed that the final embryo masses are as small as mars mass for 1 - 100km - sized planetesimals in the minimum mass solar nebula ( hereafter mmsn ; * ? ? ?",
    "large planetesimals , which are relatively hard to be broken collisionally , and a massive disk produce massive final embryos",
    ". however , collisional fragmentation makes it difficult to form giant planets along the lines of the core - accretion model ; starting from 100km - sized planetesimals , planetary embryos can reach the critical core mass for gas accretion only inside 34au in a disk that is 10 times more massive than the mmsn model .    the motion of fragments @xmath3 m is coupled with gas .",
    "the drift timescale of such fragments are relatively long .",
    "@xcite proposed that embryos may accrete a large amount of such fragments .",
    "however , the strong gas drag in the stokes regime is dominant for fragments @xmath5 m and damps the relative velocities to halt collision cascade at @xmath6@xmath7 m as mentioned above .",
    "therefore , only a small amount of coupled bodies are produced and hence they hardly contribute to embryo growth @xcite .",
    "many authors have investigated embryo growth with @xmath8-body , statistical , and hybrid simulations @xcite . although providing most accurate dynamical results , @xmath8-body simulations have difficulty in producing numerous fragments and following their fate . the fragmentation effect on embryo growth",
    "has thus not been treated in detail in spite of its importance .",
    "recently , levison et al . (",
    "2010 ) included fragment production in their @xmath8-body simulation .",

    "such successive collisions are essential in the collision cascade ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , statistical simulations are a better method to accurately investigate planet formation with fragmentation .    in the statistical simulation , the collisional mass evolution of bodies is calculated within a `` particle - in - a - box '' approximation .",
    "bodies have horizontal and vertical components of random velocity relative to a circular orbit that are determined by their eccentricities and inclinations , respectively .",
    "these velocities are changed by gravitational interactions between the bodies and hence affected by their mass spectrum , while the collision rates between the bodies depend on the velocities .",
    "therefore , the coupled mass and velocity evolution needs to be solved @xcite . while the statistical method has advantages , its weak point is the inability to track the individual positions of planetesimals .",
    "however , progress in planetary dynamic theory @xcite has helped to overcome this problem .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite provided detailed expressions for the probability of collisions between planetesimals orbiting a central star , while @xcite and @xcite derived improved equations for calculating the evolution of random planetesimal velocities caused by gravitational interactions .",
    "finally , it has been shown that the recently developed statistical codes can describe some aspects of the planetary accumulation processes with the same accuracy as @xmath8-body simulations @xcite .    since the timescale of collision cascade strongly affects the final mass of planetary embryos @xcite , fragmentation outcome models are essential for embryo growth .",
    "collisional fragmentation includes several uncertain parameters .",
    "@xcite constructed a simple fragmentation model which is consistent with laboratory experiments @xcite and hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and analytically clarified which parameters are essential .",
    "they found that the mass depletion due to collision cascades is sensitive to the total ejecta mass yielded by a single collision , while it is almost independent of the mass of the largest ejecta fragment and the size distribution of ejecta over a realistic parameter region .",
    "furthermore , fragmenting collisions are subdivided into two types , catastrophic disruption and cratering ( erosive collision ) . although some studies neglected or underestimated the effect of cratering @xcite , kobayashi & tanaka showed that cratering collisions make a dominant contribution to the collision cascade .    a planetary embryo larger than @xmath9 earth masses acquires a tenuous atmosphere of gas from the disk",
    "fragments are captured by the atmosphere even if they do not collide directly with the embryo , implying that the collisional cross section of the embryo is enhanced .",
    "this effect advances the growth of mars - mass or larger embryos @xcite .",
    "embryos with the atmospheres accrete fragments prior to their drift inward and can acquire more than @xmath10 earth masses starting from 10km - sized planetesimals @xcite .",
    "however , erosive collisions and initial planetesimal sizes strongly affect final embryo masses @xcite .",
    "this paper investigates the embryo growth taking into account erosive collisions and embryo s atmosphere .",
    "although growing embryos may fall into a central star due to the type i migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
