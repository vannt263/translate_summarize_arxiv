    "many studies have demonstrated that transport properties of condensed matter with nanometer size range and low dimensionality can exhibit interesting features .",
    "for example , the electron transport through a nanoobject ( i.e. a small molecule , nanowire or atomic chain ) shows novel features@xcite owing to two facts : ( 1 ) the electronic states confined in directions which are perpendicular to the one for the current flow are quantized .",
    "the level spacings@xcite , @xmath0 , of the quantized states of the nanoparticle are finite but strongly size and geometry dependent .",
    "( 2 ) the mean distance , @xmath1 , traveled by an electron between two terminals is smaller than the phase breaking length , @xmath2 , ( i.e. @xmath3 ) .",
    "consequently , a stepwise behaviour in the electrical conductance is observed under ballistic transport through a point contact created by an stm tip@xcite ( or through a narrow constriction between two reservoirs of two - dimensional electron gas in high mobility gaas - gaalas heterostructures@xcite ) , because the quantization and coherence of electronic states become pronounced .",
    "the ballistic electrical conductance @xmath4 was found@xcite to vary with the radius of contact , @xmath5 , ( or with the width of the constriction , @xmath6 ) in quantized steps of approximately @xmath7 , when @xmath5 or @xmath6 is in the range of fermi wave length @xmath8 . +   + in view of the interesting physics underlying the ballistic electron transport through a nanoobject between two electrodes , we conjectured@xcite earlier that similar effects should occur also in the heat conduction _ via phonons_. similar to a constriction in electrical conduction , we expect that a nanoobject has a discrete vibrational frequency spectrum with finite spacings , @xmath9 , determined by its atomic configuration and size .",
    "furthermore , when a nanoobject is placed between two reservoirs , collective vibrational modes ( phonons ) which involve the coherent vibrations of the atoms in the nanoobject and reservoirs can be developed , leading to the process of ballistic thermal conductivity .",
    "the thermal conductance , @xmath10 , depends on the available number of channels and hence it is expected to increase in discrete values each time a new ballistic channel is included in the heat transfer .",
    "each vibrational mode contributes to the heat transfer , but its contribution is weighted by planck s distribution @xmath11 . therefore , @xmath12 is determined by phonons with energies up to thermal energy ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this may lead to smearing of the step structure of @xmath12 .",
    "this feature of quantization of thermal conduction differs from that of electrical conduction , because the former complies with bose - einstein statistics .",
    "+   + heat transfer through a nanoobject is also related to the atomic scale dry friction and lubrication@xcite . when two objects move relative to each other , they engage in contact through various atomic scale asperities or lubricant molecules . in these studies ,",
    "the emphasis is placed on the energy dissipation .",
    "the mechanical energy of the relative motion is dissipated by ( a ) the creation of electron - hole pairs , and ( b ) by the creation of non - equilibrium phonon distribution at the close proximity of the asperity@xcite . in the latter case , the main issue is the thermal conductance related to the heat transfer between the vibrational modes of the asperities ( or lubricant molecule ) and those of the objects , that leads to the energy dissipation@xcite .",
    "in addition , the heat transfer is also an interesting issue in nanodevices@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the thermal conduction through a nanoobject .",
    "+   + the objective of this work is to investigate the effects of the quantized nature of vibrational modes of a dielectric wire on _ phononic _ heat transfer between two reservoirs . to this end",
    ", the ballistic heat transfer through a uniform dielectric wire is investigated first .",
    "we also studied the thermal conduction through a finite atomic wire .",
    "as an example , the heat transfer through a three - atom chain placed between two reservoirs with large cross section are examined by performing numerical calculations on a model system@xcite .",
    "we found that the thermal conductance of a uniform atomic wire at low temperature is independent of material and increases linearly with temperature . for finite atomic wire",
    "both longitudinal acoustic and optical modes contribute to the thermal conductance ; the latter modes may lead to stepwise behavior .",
    "the system of interest is schematically described in the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 . heat flows from the left ( l ) to the right ( r ) through a nanoobject ( c ) . here",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 can be sections of nanoobject itself or heat reservoirs .",
    "the temperature of l and r , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively are kept constant , so that the steady state of the transport is considered . for this system",
    "we investigate the thermal conduction by using a model hamiltonian approach . to find the modes which are responsible for the ballistic transport of heat ,",
    "we specify first a zero order vibrational hamiltonian which characterizes the possible modes in the three regions,@xmath18 , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the momentum quantum numbers for vibrational mode @xmath21 belonging to the branch @xmath22 in one of the three regions ( @xmath23 ) , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the corresponding annihilation ( creation ) operator .",
    "the heat transfer via phonons is realized when @xmath14,@xmath26 , and @xmath15 are coupled and @xmath27 .",
    "the coupling can be described by an interaction hamiltonian , @xmath28 in terms of the harmonic @xmath29 and anharmonic @xmath30 coupling coefficients .",
    "this hamiltonian has been used to predict localized and extended vibrational modes in molecular crystals@xcite .",
    "the present application is similar to the transfer hamiltonian approach@xcite . as we emphasized earlier , we consider only the thermal conduction mediated by phonons . the electronic states , as well as the electron - phonon interactions are not included in eq.(1 ) and eq.(2 ) .",
    "+   + the modes responsible for the ballistic heat transport are provided mainly by the harmonic couplings . before discussing the effects of the harmonic coupling , we comment on the anharmonic terms .",
    "the anharmonic couplings describe the phonon - phonon interactions which are the mechanism responsible for several dissipative processes , such as energy loss to local modes of the nanowire and thermal resistance due to umklapp process . depending on the strength of the anharmonic coupling , the continuing energy transfer to the localized modes may result in _ energy discharge _ to the heat transporting states , or _",
    "desorption _ or migration of an atom .",
    "the former event , i.e. the excitation of a local phonon , followed by deexcitation can occur periodically and can be manifested in the time variation of the conductance , @xmath31 .",
    "the detail of the anharmonic effects will not be discussed further in this paper . in what follows",
    "we apply the above approach to calculate the thermal conductance of a uniform dielectric wire ( sec .",
    "iii ) and also of a finite atomic chain ( sec .",
    "we now consider three sections on a uniform wire . owing to the uniformity of the sections ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the phonon modes are the normal modes of the system , hence @xmath33 , and also @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath35 .",
    "if the effect of mode decay is considered , the rate of the heat transfer from @xmath14 to @xmath15 in this 1d system is given by @xmath36 by using the decay rate expression@xcite for a given @xmath22 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 with @xmath39 . by symmetry @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the planck s distribution @xmath44^{-1}$ ] given in terms of the frequency of the mode and temperature of the section , @xmath45 . hence @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "are expressed in terms of planck s distribution functions .",
    "the net rate of heat transfer through the chain is @xmath48 . since @xmath49 and @xmath50 at low temperature ,",
    "@xmath51 is expressed in the following form @xmath52\\,\\omega \\,d\\omega\\ ] ] here index @xmath22 of the summation sign specifies the branches for @xmath49 and @xmath53 . note that eq.(5 ) yields exactly the same expression of current one obtains from the phenomenological approach@xcite by assuming the transmission coefficients , @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the present approach justifies the landauer type expression of heat current by deriving it from the model hamiltonian specified by eq.(1 ) .",
    "now , we consider first an atomic chain that has only three branches and evaluate eq.(5 ) for @xmath55 .",
    "we take @xmath16 and @xmath17 small so that the upper limit of the integral in eq.(5 ) is justified . defining @xmath56 , the following expression for the ballistic thermal conductance , @xmath57 ,",
    "is obtained , @xmath58 according to this interesting result the ballistic conductance of each branch @xmath22 of the uniform and harmonic atomic chain is limited by the value @xmath59 .",
    "it is independent of any material property , and is linearly dependent on @xmath60 .",
    "the total thermal conductance becomes @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the total number of branches .",
    "for an ideal 1d atomic chain @xmath63 , if the transverse vibrations are allowed .",
    "the result agrees with the well - known expression derived earlier for dielectric bridges@xcite . for a homogeneous wire that has a larger cross section , more subbands can now be present due to the transverse confinement of the vibrational motions in the direction perpendicular to the propagation . in this case , the ballistic thermal conductance of a branch with @xmath64 is smaller than @xmath65 due to the finite frequency of a subband through the occupancy of planck s distribution .",
    "for example , with two subband frequencies , @xmath66 and @xmath67 at @xmath68 , the thermal conductance of each channel at @xmath69 is calculated from eq.(5 ) to be @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . at @xmath72 ,",
    "these contributions increase to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "consequently , one expects that each subband in the wire having @xmath64 , that formed by increasing the cross section , leads to a jump in @xmath12 as in the electrical conduction .",
    "however , the amplitude of steps decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath75 at given low temperature t. furthermore , an important difference between the electrical and thermal conductance is that all the modes of a given branch @xmath22 contribute to @xmath65 , whereas the quantum ballistic electrical conduction in the 1d channels@xcite is governed by the fermi - dirac distribution . +   + recently , greiner et al.@xcite calculated the thermal conductance of free electrons for 1d ballistic and diffusive transport in the linear response regime by using the correlation function formalism .",
    "they derived a universal expression for the electronic thermal conductance of a degenerate electron gas , @xmath76 , that is the same as @xmath65 found for the phononic thermal conductance in eq.(6 ) .",
    "interestingly , electrons and phonons have the same universal value for their thermal conductance at low temperature , in spite of the different statistics they obey .",
    "we believe that this situation originates from the fact that both systems follow the same distribution , @xmath77 for @xmath78 . here , @xmath79 for phonons , and @xmath80 for electrons , @xmath81 and @xmath82 being electron energy and chemical potential .",
    "the quantum heat transfer through a uniform and harmonic atomic wire is an idealized situation .",
    "a more realistic system consists of a finite atomic wire , @xmath26 coupled to reservoirs @xmath14 and @xmath15 . here",
    "the finite atomic wire has discrete vibrational frequency spectrum , while those of reservoirs are continuous . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 the corresponding densities of states , @xmath83 , are schematically described .",
    "it is also noted that cross sections change abruptly where the atomic wire is connected to the reservoirs . as a result , the transmission coefficient , @xmath84 because of reflections . on the other hand ,",
    "the application of the continuum theory to determine the transmission coefficients as in the case of dielectric wires@xcite having cross section ( 50 nm x 50 nm ) is not justified here owing to the discrete character and small size of the finite atomic wire .",
    "moreover , the modes of wire differ from those of the reservoirs ; @xmath26 itself is not uniform in the sense that the atoms near the boundary experience different force constants .",
    "we now treat such a general non - uniform dielectric wire .",
    "+   + in order to analyze the character of the modes of a finite wire and to present an example we carried out numerical calculations on a prototype model that consists of a chain of 3 atoms placed between two reservoirs .",
    "each reservoir ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) is modeled by 7 ( 001 ) atomic planes of the fcc structure .",
    "the whole system ( @xmath85 ) comprises 451 atoms .",
    "the interatomic distances between an atom in the chain and nearest slab - atoms and between its adjacent chain atoms are taken , 2.7 , 2.6 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the electrical conduction through these atoms is zero , and hence the energy transfer through electrons is not allowed .",
    "since we are concerned with the vibrational modes of the system , which are responsible for the energy transfer , we express the interatomic interactions by a prototype empirical , morse - type two - body potential .",
    "then , we set up the dynamical matrix of the system and calculate the normal modes and their frequencies @xmath86 .",
    "+   + our analysis distinguished three different types of modes : i ) modes localized strongly in the chain .",
    "ii ) modes confined to the reservoir(s ) .",
    "iii ) current - transporting resonant modes .",
    "note that only confined modes would appear if the coupling between the chain and the reservoirs were weak .",
    "the modes in the first two categories ( i , ii ) can not be involved in the heat transfer , but they affect the thermal conduction by increasing the thermal resistance through anharmonic couplings .",
    "the transverse modes of the finite chain are well localized owing to the different coupling constants and different number of neighbors as compared to the atoms in the reservoirs . on the other hand ,",
    "the longitudinal modes are coupled to those of the reservoirs and form resonant modes .",
    "figure 2 illustrates three resonant modes of the atoms .",
    "their relative motions are indicated by the arrows .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) can be considered as longitudinal optical branches and ( c ) the acoustic branch .",
    "therefore , the resonant modes can be also contributed by the optical branches .",
    "figure 2 also shows that the local densities of states within the chain , @xmath87 , associated with these modes , @xmath88 , which are calculated from the spectrum of the dynamical matrix .",
    "we now consider the ballistic heat transfer through resonances .",
    "starting from the rate expression given in sec .",
    "iii , the ballistic thermal conductance for a single resonant mode @xmath89 , is given by , @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "for large @xmath92 , @xmath93 . on the other hand @xmath94",
    "if @xmath92 is small . in view of the analysis in ref",
    "[ 25 ] , the thermal conductance of a finite atomic chain due to all resonance modes can be obtained from the sum over these modes , @xmath88 , @xmath95^{-2}\\,d\\omega\\ ] ] here @xmath96 is the local density of states for the resonant modes derived from the mode @xmath88 and @xmath97 is average velocity associated with the same mode .",
    "this density of states modifies the ideal ballistic transmission as @xmath98 does to @xmath51 in ref [ 23 ] .",
    "if @xmath96 in eq.(8 ) is replaced by @xmath99 corresponding to a branch of uniform atomic chain , the thermal conductance @xmath12 in eq.(8 ) yields the universal value @xmath65 . by using a value of @xmath100 deduced from the slab calculations , we calculate @xmath101 due to resonance in fig .",
    "2(c ) and illustrate it in inset in the same panel .",
    "for @xmath102 k , @xmath12 increases with @xmath60 , then @xmath12 saturates as @xmath103 k. this latter fact is the consequence of @xmath104 at small @xmath92 discussed above .",
    "+ we shall emphasize an interesting feature of @xmath12 that can be revealed from eq.(8 ) .",
    "each atom incorporated in the finite chain between two reservoirs adds 3 ( optical ) modes .",
    "so as the chain becomes longer by including new atoms , the number of longitudinal optical modes which may give rise to resonant modes increases .",
    "accordingly , each resonant mode labeled by @xmath88 that can lead to a current transporting channel , shall give rise to a step increase in @xmath12 by increasing the temperature .",
    "apparently , the step behavior can occur without having subbands in the transverse direction .",
    "this situation is relevant for the energy transport through molecules attached ( i.e chemisorbed or physisorbed ) to the surfaces .",
    "the thermal conductance associated with the phononic heat transfer for a molecule having discrete vibrational frequency spectrum may exhibit at least non - monotonic variation with temperature . whether the step behavior of thermal conductance can be resolved depends on the frequency and level spacing of the resonance modes . according to a criterion put forward by blencowe@xcite , @xmath105 in order to resolve the quantum features of @xmath101 . as for the question whether @xmath12 of a molecule or an atomic chain between two reservoirs increases by incorporating new atoms , the answer is not straightforward .",
    "it depends on the new modes yielding new resonance mode , and also @xmath106 and @xmath97 associated these modes .",
    "nevertheless , this is an interesting issue that deserves further study .",
    "the contacts to the reservoirs by themselves can set a resistance .",
    "it should also be noted that increasing the length of the chain by including more atoms can lead to the possibility of introducing imperfections in the structure .",
    "the phonon - phonon interaction due to anharmonic coupling ( that is not considered here ) can also contribute to the resistance of the wire .",
    "hence the probability of observing such coherent conductance decreases . as a result , the resistance to heat current increases .",
    "in this work we analyzed important features of the heat conduction via phonons through a dielectric wire . in particular , we investigated the ballistic heat transfer through a uniform and harmonic wire and also through a finite atomic chain . by using a model hamiltonian approach we showed that the conductance of a uniform atomic chain at low temperature is consistent with the well - known universal value , and",
    "varies linearly with temperature .",
    "as the cross section of the wire becomes larger to include several subbands due to the confinement of the transverse motion of ions , each subband contributes to the ballistic thermal conductance by an amount that depends on @xmath60 and the threshold frequency of the subband , @xmath75 .",
    "the higher the frequency of the mode , the less its contribution to @xmath12 . the resulting step behavior shall be observable , if they are not smeared out .",
    "we analyzed also the nature of modes for a finite atomic chain placed between two reservoirs .",
    "we found resonance modes originating from longitudinal optical modes , which can contribute to the ballistic thermal conductance .",
    "they differ from the subbands due to lateral confinement but should also exhibit stepwise behavior in @xmath12 .",
