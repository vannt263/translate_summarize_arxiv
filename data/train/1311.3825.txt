    "tensor effects in mean  field  based theories with effective interactions have been extensively studied by several groups in the last decade .    an early attempt to adjust the tensor parameters",
    "was performed in the 70s by stancu et al .",
    "@xcite on top of the skyrme parametrization siii @xcite and provided indicative boundaries for the values of the tensor parameters , that constitute the so  called stancu  brink  flocard ( sbf ) triangle . recently , more modern and upgraded parametrizations were proposed , some of them going beyond the limits fixed by the sbf triangle .",
    "tensor parameters were introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the skyrme parametrization skx @xcite .",
    "brink and stancu reconsidered their previous adjustment and provided new tensor parameters by including this time also single  particle observables of exotic nuclei in the adjustment procedure @xcite .",
    "col et al .",
    "introduced tensor parameters @xcite on top of the skyrme interaction sly5 @xcite .",
    "lesinski et al . adjusted 36 parametrizations by performing a global fit of all the skyrme parameters including the tensor contribution @xcite .",
    "new tensor parameters were proposed also in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a special emphasis has been put on the importance of using single  particle properties in the adjustment of the parameters .    much less work has been published for finite  range interactions . in the interactions introduced by nakada , a finite  range ( yukawa form ) tensor term",
    "is included @xcite .",
    "on the other side , the tensor contribution is systematically disregarded in the currently used gogny interactions @xcite , like d1s @xcite and d1 m @xcite . in the pioneering study of onishi and negele ,",
    "a gaussian tensor term was added to a gaussian central term and its effects were analyzed @xcite .",
    "the first parametrization in the framework of the full gogny interaction was introduced only very recently by otsuka et al .",
    "@xcite , by including a gaussian tensor  isospin term and by refitting all the other gogny parameters together with the tensor parameter .",
    "also co et al .",
    "introduced a finite  range tensor ",
    "isospin term @xcite , but the tensor contribution was added on top of the existing d1s and d1 m gogny interactions .",
    "more recently , a pure gaussian tensor term was included together with a tensor ",
    "isospin term of the same type to allow the authors to adjust in a separate and independent way the neutron ",
    "proton and the like  nucleon tensor contributions in the gogny framework , as is commonly done in the skyrme case @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the neutron ",
    "proton and the like  particle contributions are indeed proportional and have the same sign if only a tensor ",
    "isospin term is included .    in this work ,",
    "we start from some existing parametrizations with the objective of putting global phenomenological boundaries for the acceptable values of the parameters governing the neutron ",
    "proton and the like  particle contributions of the skyrme and gogny tensor forces .",
    "for the skyrme case , the existing parametrizations of col et al .",
    "( that we call sly5@xmath4 ) and brink et al . @xcite ( siii@xmath4 ) , as well as four parametrizations taken from the work of lesinski et al .",
    "@xcite will be considered . as an illustration ,",
    "we have chosen t@xmath5 , t@xmath6 , t@xmath7 and t@xmath8 because each of these parametrizations explores one of the possible signs of the two tensor parameters . for the gogny case ,",
    "there is only one study where the two tensor contributions have been studied independently @xcite .",
    "our starting point for the gogny case will be the interaction d1st2a introduced in ref . @xcite .",
    "we follow the same idea as in refs . @xcite and analyze the neutron @xmath9 spin  orbit splittings in the three nuclei @xmath1ca , @xmath2ca and @xmath3ni .",
    "first , we check the @xmath0 spin ",
    "orbit splitting in the spin  saturated nucleus @xmath1ca and modify the spin  orbit parameter to better reproduce this quantity .",
    "we then check how well the neutron @xmath0 spin ",
    "orbit splitting is reproduced in the nucleus @xmath2ca . in this case , only the like  particle contribution enters into play because this nucleus is spin  saturated in protons .",
    "we mention that this spin ",
    "orbit splitting has already been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to adjust the like  particle part of the gogny tensor term . in this second step ,",
    "the parameter governing the like  particle contribution is modified .",
    "finally , we check the neutron ",
    "proton contribution of the tensor term in the nucleus @xmath3ni where both contributions are active and we adjust the corresponding parameter ( the like  particle part , already fixed in the previous step , is kept fixed ) .",
    "this procedure follows what has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in the context of the energy density functional ( edf ) , the isoscalar tensor coupling constant @xmath10 has been adjusted on the @xmath0 spin ",
    "orbit splitting of the nucleus @xmath3ni and the isovector tensor coupling constant @xmath11 has been adjusted on the same spin ",
    "orbit splitting in the nuleus @xmath2ca .",
    "it has to be mentioned that , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the single  particle energies are evaluated for even nuclei by using the theoretical mass of such nuclei and the masses of the neighboring odd nuclei .",
    "this allows the authors to perform a more meaningful comparison with the corresponding experimental single ",
    "particle energies that are extracted in the same way from the experimental masses . to do this",
    ", a correct treatment of odd nuclei has to be done by breaking the time  reversal symmetry . to compare with the experimental values we treat in this work only even nuclei , we keep the spherical symmetry and we use the single  particle hartree ",
    "fock ( hf ) energies .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the meaning of the tensor parameters in the skyrme and gogny cases is briefly recalled . in sec .",
    "iii the @xmath0 spin  orbit splittings are analyzed in the three nuclei @xmath1ca , @xmath2ca , and @xmath3ni and the tensor effects related to each parameter are studied .",
    "orbit paramater ( tensor ) parameters are modified to better reproduce the experimental values in @xmath1ca ( @xmath2ca and @xmath3ca ) .",
    "regions for acceptable values of the parameters are identified .",
    "conclusions are reported in sec .",
    "in the following , we assume for simplicity spherical symmetry and perform hf calculations by neglecting pairing correlations . the correlations associated to the particle  vibration coupling are also neglected .",
    "the objective is not to perform accurate adjustments , but to provide some trends and to exclude , on the basis of phenomenological arguments , regions of parameter values that lead to an incorrect description of the tensor effects .      by considering the zero  range tensor term already included in the original work of skyrme @xcite ,",
    "the so  called @xmath12 terms appear in the mean  field hamiltonian density , where @xmath13 is the spin  orbit density . the two parameters governing these terms",
    "are often called @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "they contain both a central  exchange contribution ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and a tensor contribution ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are expressed in terms of the skyrme parameters of the velocity  dependent terms : @xmath21 the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are written as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the strengths of the skyrme zero  range tensor force in even and odd states of relative motion , respectively @xcite ; @xmath18 describes the like  particle and @xmath19 the neutron ",
    "proton tensor contributions .",
    "the hamiltonian density that is obtained within the variational hf scheme by starting from the skyrme ",
    "hamiltonian represents the so  called skyrme energy functional , that is a functional of the local density .",
    "the coupling constants of this density functional are expressed in terms of the skyrme parameters . on the other side , within an edf perspective , by writing down a functional of the local density in its most general form",
    ", the tensor contribution is governed by the so  called isoscalar @xmath10 and isovector @xmath11 coupling constants , that are related to the above mentioned parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 as follows : @xmath25      we consider a gaussian tensor term like in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the isospin exchange operator and @xmath28 the usual tensor operator .",
    "the range @xmath29 of this force has been chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite equal to the longest range of the d1s gogny interaction , that is @xmath30 fm .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the strengths of the tensor force . in particular , @xmath33 is the strength of the force acting in like - nucleon pairs whereas @xmath32 represents the strength for the neutron ",
    "proton contribution .",
    "let us consider first the fully spin - saturated nucleus @xmath1ca .",
    "the @xmath0 spin ",
    "orbit splitting is not dependent on the tensor part of the force for this nucleus .",
    "this guarantees that the spin ",
    "orbit parameter can be tuned in a clean and proper way because it represents the only contribution to the spin  orbit potential . in the upper panels of fig .",
    "1 we show the neutron @xmath9 spin ",
    "orbit splitting for the three nuclei @xmath1ca ( a ) , @xmath2ca ( b ) , and @xmath3ni ( c ) obtained with the chosen skyrme forces and the gogny interaction of ref .",
    "the experimental values are taken from ref .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the neutron @xmath34 state is strongly fragmented in the nucleus @xmath1ca . for our adjustment",
    ", we have used the cetroid energy that is equal to 6.8 mev and that is evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite by taking 24 states between 4.9 and 9.1 mev .",
    "this centroid value is coherent with that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we observe in panel ( a ) that the spin ",
    "orbit splitting is systematically larger than the experimental value with all the used effective interactions for the nucleus @xmath1ca .",
    "we thus reduce in all cases the spin ",
    "orbit parameter of the force to obtain a value closer to the experimental splitting ( d ) .",
    "the reduced spin  orbit parameters @xmath35 are reported in table i. for simplicity , we employ along this work the same names for the forces , even if the parameters are refitted .    .upper line : standard spin  orbit parameters @xmath35 associated to each force .",

    "in this work we have used a fitting protocol introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite starting from existing skyrme and gogny effective interactions that include a tensor force .",
    "first , the spin ",
    "orbit parameter of the chosen existing parametrizations ( six skyrme and one gogny sets of parameters ) is modified ( reduced in all cases ) to reproduce the neutron @xmath0 spin ",
    "orbit splitting in the fully spin  saturated nucleus @xmath1ca .",
    "this case of @xmath1ca has been chosen as an example of isotope where the standard spin ",
    "orbit strength does not provide the correct splitting and the tensor force has no effects .",
    "this indicates the necessity of checking the spin  orbit strength before performing the adjustment of the tensor parameters .    by employing this parameter ,",
    "the like  particle tensor effect is tuned on the nucleus @xmath2ca to reproduce the neutron @xmath0 spin ",
    "orbit splitting .",
    "this nucleus is spin  saturated for protons and the neutron ",
    "proton tensor effect is thus negligible .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 ( @xmath38 ) for the skyrme ( gogny ) case is readjusted for those interactions where these parameters are negative . on the other side ,",
    "the skyrme interactions where @xmath14 is positive are excluded because they do not provide the correct behavior with respect to the experimental values .",
    "finally , by keeping the new spin  orbit and like  particle tensor parameters , we tune the neutron ",
    "proton tensor contribution on the nucleus @xmath3ni that is spin  unsaturated .",
    "only the skyrme interactions where @xmath15 is positive are retained because @xmath39 leads to a wrong tensor effect .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath32 are then modified to reproduce the experimental splitting . in some cases these parameters",
    "are reduced and in other cases increased with respect to their original values .",
    "the general result is that these parameters have to be positive .",
    "it is worth observing that the signs of the tensor skyrme parameters are the same as the corresponding gogny parameters , in spite of the fact that the range of the tensor force is different in the two cases .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that , in the cases sly5@xmath4 and d1st2a , the ratio between the parameters that governs the like  particle and the neutron ",
    "proton channels is very similar ( -1.4 and -1.2 , respectively ) .    with the present phenomenological arguments , based on the fitting protocol of refs .",
    "@xcite , all the skyrme parametrizations of ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath14 is positive or @xmath15 is negative have to be excluded . the found regions of acceptable values for the parameters in the gogny case can be a very useful starting point for a future full adjustment of the gogny interaction in cases where a complete ( pure tensor plus tensor  isospin ) tensor force is included .",
    "the objective of this global fit would be to provide reasonable values for the binding energies by keeping reasonably good properties related to the tensor contribution .",
