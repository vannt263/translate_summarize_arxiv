    "wireless mesh networks are currently being investigated for their potential to resolve the performance limitations of both infrastructure ( cellular ) and multi - hop ( ad hoc ) networks in terms of quality - of - service and coverage mesh .",
    "basically , mesh networks prescribe the combination of communication via direct transmission to infrastructure nodes ( base stations ) and via multi - hop transmission through intermediate nodes ( relay stations )",
    ". the latter can generally be mobile terminals , or fixed stations appropriately located by the service provider .",
    "the assessment of the performance of such networks is an open problem that has attracted interest from different communities and fields , especially information - theory @xcite hybrid and networking @xcite .",
    "recently , there has also been considerable interest in further enhancing the performance of infrastructure or mesh networks by endowing the system with a central processor able to pool the signals received by the base stations and perform joint processing ( this scenario is usually referred to as distributed antennas or multi - cell processing ) @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on a linear mesh network as sketched in fig .",
    "it is assumed that one  mobile terminal ( mt )  is active in each cell in a given time - frequency resource ( as for intra - cell tdma  or fdma ) and that each active mt communicates with the same - cell base station ( bs ) via a dedicated relay station ( rs ) ( two - hop transmission ) . in order to allow meaningful analysis and insight ,",
    "this scenario is modelled as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ topology2 ] , where symmetry is assumed in the channel gains , i.e. , every cell is characterized by identical intra- and inter - cell propagation conditions .",
    "this framework follows the approach of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which extends the model of @xcite to mesh networks .",
    "the basic premise of this work is that the model in fig .",
    "[ topology2 ] can be seen as the cascade of two interference channels , one for each hop , with many sources and corresponding receivers ( border effects are neglected ) .",
    "therefore , from the literature on interference channels , a promising approach is that of employing rate splitting with successive interference cancellation at the receivers @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is recalled that the rationale of rate splitting is that joint decoding of ( at least part of ) the transmitted signals at the receivers has the potential to improve the achievable rates with respect to single - user decoders that treat signals other than the intended as noise .",
    "the main contributions of this work concerning the analysis of a mesh network modelled as in fig .",
    "[ topology2 ] are :    * derivation of the performance of rate splitting applied to both hops with decode - and - forward relaying ( sec .",
    "[ sec_transmission ] ) ; * proposal of a cooperative transmission scheme for the rss that leverages the common information obtained by the relays as a by - product of the use of rate splitting in the first hop ( sec . [ sec_second ] ) ; * analysis of the cooperative transmission scheme above in the presence of multi - cell processing ( sec . [ sec_second ] ) ; and * performance evaluation of rate splitting , with possible relay cooperation in the second hop , via numerical simulations ; comparison with the reference cases of single - rate transmission and multi - cell processing is provided as well ( sec . [ sec_numerical ] ) .",
    "related work was recently reported in @xcite @xcite simeone - df , where a cellular model similar to the one in fig .",
    "topology2 was addressed under the assumption of amplify - and - forward simeone twc @xcite or decode - and - forward ( df )  relaying simeone - df with single - rate transmission .",
    "we study the abstraction of the two - hop mesh network of fig .",
    "[ topology1 ] as sketched in fig .",
    "[ topology2 ] .",
    "cells are arranged in a linear fashion , one user transmitting on a given time - frequency resource in each cell .",
    "moreover , we focus on non - faded gaussian channels and assume homogeneous conditions for the channel power gains so that the intra - cell ms - to - rs ( first hop ) and rs - to - bs ( second hop ) power gains are @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , for all cells , and , similarly , the inter - cell power gains between adjacent cells are @xmath2 and @xmath3 for first and second hop , respectively .",
    "notice that as in @xcite each cell receives signals only from adjacent cells .",
    "moreover , here there exist no direct paths between mts and bss and no relevant inter - channels between rss in adjacent cells . because of the latter assumptions",
    ", we can deal with either full duplex or half duplex transmission at the relays with minor modifications , as explained below .",
    "considering , for simplicity of exposition , full - duplex transmission ( by means of perfect echo - cancellation ) , the signal received at each time by the @xmath4th rs ( first hop ) can be written as @xmath5where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ( real ) channel gains , and we assume the symbols transmitted by the mts , @xmath8 to be drawn from a circularly symmetric complex gaussian distribution with power @xmath9=p_{1}.$ ] moreover , the additive noise @xmath10 is complex gaussian with @xmath11=1.$ ] similarly , the signal received by the @xmath4th bs is @xmath12where the symbols transmitted by the rss satisfy @xmath13=p_{2}$ ] and the additive gaussian noise is such that @xmath14=1.$ ]    by symmetry , we are interested in evaluating the common rate achievable by all of the mts over the network described by fig . [ topology2 ] and equations ( [ rx signal relay])-([rx signal bs ] ) . in order to simplify the treatment , we will assume that the number of cells is large enough in order to neglect border effects ( see @xcite for further discussion on this point in the context of the cellular model of @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , in this paper we focus for simplicity of exposition on full - duplex rss . accordingly , we assume a delayed block - by - block transmission strategy whereby the information is transmitted through multiple blocks , and the number of blocks is large enough so that we can neglect the loss in spectral efficiency associated with the transmission of first ( mt  to rs ) and last ( rs to bs ) blocks .",
    "more specifically , in each block , the mts communicate new information to the rss , and , at the same time , the rss forward ( after decoding ) the information received in the previous block to the bss .",
    "the absence of a direct path between mts and bss allows rss and bss to perform block - by - block decoding without resorting to more complicated decoding strategies @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the same reason , the full - duplex coding schemes considered in this paper can be easily adapted to half - duplex rss by simply alternating transmission from mt or rs in each block . in the case of half - duplex then , since the mts transmit new information only once every two blocks , the corresponding achievable rates are easily seen to be just half of the corresponding rates with full duplex derived here .    in this section ,",
    "we first review the basic reference case of single - rate transmission ( sec .",
    "[ sec_single rate ] ) and then evaluate the achievable rate with rate splitting in both hops ( sec .",
    "[ sec_rs_region ] and sec_rs ) .      as a preliminary example and reference case ,",
    "consider the following simple coding scheme based on df relaying ( further analyzed in a more general framework in @xcite ) . in every block",
    ", each mt  transmits to the same - cell rs a gaussian codeword taken from a rate-@xmath15 codebook .",
    "the rs decodes the message treating the signals from adjacent cells as gaussian interference ( single - user decoding ) , and forwards it in the next block to the same - cell bs , that finally performs single - user decoding . the maximum achievable rate per user of this scheme is easily shown to be@xmath16where we have defined the function @xmath17 and the two terms inside the inner parentheses correspond to the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratios ( sinrs ) at the rs and bs , respectively .",
    "the performance of this scheme is poor when the inter - cell interference , i.e. , the value of parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 is large . in the next section",
    ", we attempt to alleviate this problem by leveraging on the idea of rate splitting with multiple access channel ( mac ) decomposition , first employed in @xcite in the context of the conventional ( @xmath20 interference channel ( see also @xcite ) .      in this section ,",
    "we focus on the first hop , between mts and rss , and propose a coding scheme based on the principle of rate splitting for the interference channel @xcite .",

    "<S> a linear mesh network is considered in which a single user per cell communicates to a local base station via a dedicated relay ( two - hop communication ) . </S>",
    "<S> exploiting the possibly relevant inter - cell channel gains , rate splitting with successive cancellation in both hops is investigated as a promising solution to improve the rate of basic single - rate communications . </S>",
    "<S> then , an alternative solution is proposed that attempts to improve the performance of the second hop ( from the relays to base stations ) by cooperative transmission among the relay stations . </S>",
    "<S> the cooperative scheme leverages the common information obtained by the relays as a by - product of the use of rate splitting in the first hop . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results bring insight into the conditions ( network topology and power constraints ) under which rate splitting , with possible relay cooperation , is beneficial . </S>",
    "<S> multi - cell processing ( joint decoding at the base stations ) is also considered for reference . </S>"
