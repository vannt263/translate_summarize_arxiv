    "the electron - doped infinite - layer compounds ( sr@xmath4ln@xmath5)cuo@xmath2 ( ln = la , sm , nd , gd , etc . ) consist of an infinite stacking of cuo@xmath6 planes and metallic ( sr ) layers.@xcite this is the simplest structure that contains only the key ingredients of all high-@xmath7 cuprates . the charge reservoir block common to other cuprate superconductors does not exist in this compound .",
    "superconductivity in the infinite - layer compounds was first observed by smith _",
    "et al_. for ( sr@xmath8nd@xmath9)cuo@xmath2.@xcite since the structure is so simple , it provides a unique opportunity to explore superconductivity unscreened by  the charge reservoir block .",
    "several interesting properties have been observed for infinite - layer compounds . since the average distance between cuo@xmath2 planes",
    "is reduced due to the absence of the charge reservoir block , the interlayer coupling is expected to be very strong , which should strengthen the superconductivity .",
    "however , @xmath7 is only about 43 k,@xcite and neither the size of ionic radius , the magnetic moment , nor the concentration of ln ions at sr sites affects @xmath7.@xcite moreover , the oxygen is very stoichiometric ; neither vacancies nor interstitial oxygen exists.@xcite    so far , the study of superconductivity in these compounds has been hindered by the lack of high quality bulk samples .",
    "however , in the case of infinite - layer superconducting films , superconducting transition temperature is much lower than those of bulk samples . for an infinite - layer superconducting film of ( sr@xmath8nd@xmath9)cuo@xmath2 , the @xmath7",
    "is reduced by about one half.@xcite high - pressure synthesis is a unique method that now allows infinite - layer compounds to be made in bulk form with various lanthanide ions doped into sr sites with larger superconducting volume fractions.@xcite    in this paper , we report the high - pressure synthesis of  the infinite - layer superconductor sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( sr(la)-112 ) .",
    "to identify the superconductivity , we measured the low - field magnetization .",
    "the resulting superconducting volume fraction was found to be greatly improved compared to the results reported so far .",
    "the high purity of the samples was confirmed by a rietveld analysis of the x - ray powder diffraction data .",
    "the high - field magnetization curves , along with the resulting irreversibility line showed , that the pinning was unusually high compared to that for hole doped cuprates .",
    "a cubic multi - anvil - type press was used to synthesize sr(la)-112.@xcite the precursors were prepared by using the solid state reaction method.@xcite starting materials of la@xmath2o@xmath10 , srco@xmath10 , and cuo were mixed to the nominal composition of sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath6 .",
    "the mixture was then calcined at 950 @xmath11c  for 36 hours with several intermittent grindings .",
    "the pelletized precursors sandwiched by ti oxygen getters were put into a au capsule in a high - pressure cell .",
    "a _ d_-type thermocouple was used to monitor the temperature .",
    "the pressure cell was compressed up to 4 gpa and then heat - treated with a graphite - sleeve heater .",
    "the temperature of the au capsule was calibrated to the heating power , and that data allowed us to use the heating power to control the sample - cell temperature .",
    "however much of the power from the power - supply was lost to the stray resistance ( _ r_@xmath12 ) between the power - supply and the graphite heater ( _ r_@xmath13 ) .",
    "even though the power was constantly supplied from the power - supply , the actual heating power of the sample fluctuated because _ r_@xmath14 changed during the synthesis ; @xmath15_r_@xmath16_r_@xmath17 .",
    "the amount of fluctuation was roughly proportional to _ r_@xmath18/_r_@xmath14 . to solve this problem , we controlled the heating power across the sample instead of the main power . with this method ,",
    "a temperature stability of @xmath19 2 @xmath11c was obtained for a two - hour heating time under high - pressure conditions .",
    "the heating power was increased linearly and then maintained constant for 2 hours .",
    "the synthesizing temperature was about @xmath20 @xmath11c .",
    "then , the sample was quenched to room temperature after an additional postannealing at @xmath21 @xmath11c for 4 hours .",
    "two conditions were important in obtaining higher quality samples .",
    "one was the long - term stability of the synthesizing temperature , and the other was the uniformity of the temperature inside the sample cell , the former being more important .",
    "the pressure cell and the heating conditions were optimized after hundreds of trials , very homogeneous samples larger than @xmath22 mg were obtained .",
    "the samples were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements using cu _",
    "k_@xmath23 radiation and a squid magnetometer ( mpms_xl _ , quantum design ) .",
    "scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and optical microscopy were also used .",
    "zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) magnetization @xmath24 curves were measured .",
    "the structural characterization at room temperature was carried out by using the rietveld refinement method to analyze the x - ray powder diffraction data .",
    "the sem image showed closely  packed grains of uniform size .",
    "it is known that the phase purity obtained from x - ray or neutron powder diffraction does not represent the purity of a superconductor .",
    "previously , it was claimed , based on the xrd data , that infinite - layer compounds were in a pure phase , but with a widely distributed superconducting volume fraction .",

    "the value of @xmath27 was varied from 20@xmath11 to 140@xmath28 in steps of 0.02@xmath11 , and the integration time was 15 seconds at each point",
    ". the rietveld refinement program rietan-94 by f. izumi with 50 parameters was used for the analysis.@xcite    the rietveld refinement profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ xrd ] . in that analysis ,",
    "the thermal factors were assumed to be isotropic , and the coordination of each atom was fixed .",
    "we constrained the sr : la ratio to the nominal stoichiometry of the precursor.@xcite the obtained values of the lattice constants agree quite well , within 0.001  , with those obtained by neutron powder diffraction.@xcite this refinement could not identify , within the resolution , any discernible amount of impurities .",
    "the agreement factors , @xmath29 , between the measured and the calculated diffraction intensities were quite small , and goodness of fit was excellent @xmath30 .",
    "the refined structural parameters are summarized in table [ refinement ] .",
    "the structural analysis of an infinite - layer compound can also give valuable information about the doping concentration because the lattice constant is sensitive to the doping concentration.@xcite note the opposite behavior of the lattice constants with doping ; the _ a-_axis expands while the _ c_-axis shrinks .",
    "the rietveld refinement showed that the doping concentration in our sr@xmath8la@xmath9cuo@xmath2 was approximately @xmath31 , which is same as the nominal composition .",

    "@xcite    the superconducting transition onset in fig .",
    "[ lowfieldmt ] appears at 43 k , which is the value typically reported for the sr(la)-112 compound.@xcite however , we can see some notable differences from the previous reports .",
