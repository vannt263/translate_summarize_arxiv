    "the relevance of properly understanding qcd is difficult to overestimate . however , due to the known difficulties associated to its strong interaction properties , the predictions of qcd are also extremely far from a satisfactory knowledge .",
    "thus , the investigation of the properties of the theory should be attacked from all possible angles , as it has been undertaken along many years @xcite .",
    "the motivations for considering this work ( and a few of previous ones done in the theme in conjunction with other colleagues @xcite ) can be resumed as follows : firstly , to consider that within modern views in high energy physics , the masses are normally searched to appear as generated by a spontaneous or dynamical symmetry breaking in starting mass less theories .",
    "then , the circumstance that the qcd conveys the strongest forces of nature , in combination with the fact that the mass less version of the theory has not a definite mass parameter , directly leads to the physical relevance of examining the scales of dynamical mass allowed by symmetry breaking processes in mass less qcd @xcite . in former works",
    "we have got indications about the possibility of generating masses in qcd @xcite . in @xcite",
    "modified feynman rules were employed for evaluating the quark masses from the dyson equation in which the simplest corrections to the self - energy determined by the condensates were retained . for this purpose",
    "the gluon condensate parameter @xmath2 was evaluated by fixing the mean value of the gluon lagrangian ( a quantity which in the proposed picture is non - vanishing in the lowest approximation ) to its estimated value in the literature .",
    "the result for initially massless quarks , surprisingly gave a value of one third of the proton mass @xcite .",
    "that is , a prediction of the constituent quark masses followed .",
    "motivated by this result , in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered similar evaluations assuming also the presence of a quark condensates for any flavour @xmath3 , @xmath4 and for the gluons @xmath2 . in this case , by properly selecting the coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath2 , it was possible to obtain the quark masses as singularities of the propagator for the six quarks , also in the simplest approximation .",
    "thus , the question emerged about the possibility for those condensate values to be generated as the result of a dynamical symmetry breaking in mass less qcd . in ref .",
    "@xcite this issue was started to be considered by evaluating particular summations of one loop diagrams .",
    "the results were positive in the direction of supporting the generation of the gluon as well as the quark condensates . however , the instability of the potential at zero value signaling the production of the quark condensate , had not a bounded from below form .",
    "this fact did not allowed to predict a concrete mean value of the condensate to be approached by the system after stabilization .",
    "however , this result could be a consequence of @xmath5first evaluations in a scheme in which the renormalization was not yet implemented or of the low order corrections which were calculated .",
    "therefore , in this work we start considering the renormalization of the proposed expansion and its application to evaluate the first order contributions to the effective action in terms of the quark and gluon condensates . for this purpose ,",
    "we are already supported by the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the gauge invariance of the proposed feynman expansion was argued .",
    "also and importantly , a procedure was devised for eliminating the apparent singularities appearing in the graph expansion due to the presence of dirac delta functions of the momenta @xcite .    here",
    "we start by introducing the renormalization prescription in the euclidean version of the generating function of the green functions @xmath6 depending of the external sources , which also will be a function of the condensate parameters for quarks and gluons .",
    "multiplicative renormalization is implemented for the fields and coupling constants in the wick expansion .",
    "however , it should be noticed that mass counter - terms will be also added , although the bare theory before the adiabatic connection of the interaction is being assumed mass less qcd .",
    "this assumption is essential : we are considering that the mass counter - terms will be automatically generated by the interactions , although they can not be implemented by the multiplicative scaling of the fields and parameters .",
    "the effective action is then introduced as usual , as the legendre transform over the external sources in favour of the mean values of the quantum fields .",
    "the effective potential determined by it , is also a function of the gluon and quark condensates and naturally it should show a minimum with respect to these quantities at the ground state . here",
    ", the fields values are fixed to vanish in the ground state assuming the lorentz invariance of the vacuum from the start .",
    "all the generating functionals defined are considered as expanded in power series of the coupling constant @xmath7 , and the two defined mass parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this reordering of the expansion of the physical quantities allows to implement the dimensional transmutation effect in the considered mass less qcd .",
    "the generating functional @xmath10 is obtained in a form that resumes the effect of the condensates as generated by gaussian weighted averages over constant homogeneous background gauge fields for gluons and quarks , respectively .",
    "these formulae are expected to be considered for detailed calculations elsewhere .",
    "finally , the lowest order correction to the potential is evaluated in more detail for the case of the single presence of the quark condensate .",
    "the dependence of the potential indicates a tendency to the dynamical generation of the condensate in the lowest order .",
    "the work will proceed as follows . in section 2 , the feynman expansion for qcd in euclidean variables and the conventions to be used ,",
    "will be described .",
    "next , in the section the renormalized generating functional expressing the feynman expansion in momentum space is written .",
    "section 3 considers the calculation of the effective potential in zero order in @xmath7 for the case of the single presence of the quark condensate .",
    "finally , the results are reviewed and commented in the summary .",
    "as remarked in the introduction the purpose of the this section is to present a renormalized version of the proposed perturbative expansion . for this aim",
    "the starting action for mass less qcd in euclidean variables will be taken in the form @xmath12 where the field intensity , and covariant derivatives follow the conventions @xmath13=if^{abc}t_c .",

    "the usual feynman propagators are regularized in the neighborhood of zero momentum by multiplying them by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the heaviside function and @xmath20 is an infinitesimal momenta cutoff , that we will call as the nakanishi parameter . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this regularization naturally arise when gauge theory propagators are properly defined .",
    "here we assumed that upon passing to the euclidean version of the theory , the prescription can be translated to eliminate a neighborhood of the momentum space near the zero momentum point .",
    "this infrared regularization in combination with a dimensional regularization rule for products of dirac delta functions evaluated at zero momenta , allowed in ref .",
    "@xcite to eliminate the singularities appearing in the perturbative series by the presence of products of delta functions evaluated at zero momenta and of them with propagators evaluated also at vanishing momenta .",
    "the vertices defining the interaction in the wick expansion formula ( [ wick ] ) have the decomposition @xmath21 where the superindices indicate the order the coupling constant associated to the original vertices in the bare action . as usual",
    "the unrenormalized bare fields ( signaled with a superindex @xmath22 will be related to their renormalized counterparts through the factors @xmath23 as @xmath24 with the also usual correspondence between the sources @xmath25 it should be underlined that the bare condensate parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 appear in the free propagators because , these constants had not been expanded yet in their renormalized and counterterm contributions .",
    "this will be performed later within what we think is a more convenient representation for this purpose .",
    "it is also assumed that the scale parameter @xmath28 of dimensional regularization links the dimensional coupling @xmath7 with its dimensionless value @xmath29 as @xmath30 the expressions for each of the vertices entering @xmath31 in ( [ vint ] ) are given in the appendix a. let us examine more closely the vertex @xmath32 associated to the mass and wave function renormalization of the bare theory .",
    "it should be first recalled that the modified expansion under consideration was motivated by deriving the wick expansion for a mass less qcd in which the mass parameter is absent .",
    "then , the renormalization procedure being investigated is consequently assumed to represent the physics of an adiabatic connection of the interaction from an originally mass less theory .",
    "therefore , we estimate as the most natural procedure to fix the bare masses of gluons and quarks as vanishing . however , it is clear that since the theory has been argued to generate mass @xcite , the connection of the interaction should be expected to produce mass counterterms in the renormalized action .",
    "these terms will also assumed to appear among the quark counterterm vertices @xmath33 in appendix a with the form : @xmath34 & = & \\int \\int dk_1dk_2(2\\pi ) ^d\\delta ^d(k_1+k_2)\\times \\\\ & & \\frac \\delta { \\delta \\eta ( k_2)}\\left ( ( z_2 - 1)k_{1\\mu } \\gamma _ \\mu + \\delta m(g_0,m_q , m_g)\\right ) \\frac \\delta { \\delta \\overline{\\eta } ( k_1)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although a non vanishing @xmath35 mean a break of pure multiplicative renormalization .",
    "this seems to be not a complication since multiplicative ; renormalization is known to be broken when the theory has no symmetries that enforces the vanishing of allowed counterterms having no counterpart in the original bare action .",
