    "over the past years , many lattice studies have been oriented towards obtaining the static potential from the wilson loop average in pure yang  mills ( ym ) theories , for quarks in different representations .",

    "this third one refers to the fact that string tensions depend on how the center @xmath4 is realized in a given @xmath0 quark representation .",
    "based on the idea of dual superconductivity @xcite-@xcite , these properties have been explored by means of lattice calculations and effective models in a higgs phase . in the former , the possibility to capture the path - integral measure by quantum ensembles of magnetic configurations",

    "phenomenological dimensionful scales are introduced from the beginning , proposing a dual superconductor where the confining string is a smooth vortex solution to the classical equations of motion .",
    "this is a magnetic object in the dual description , that is supposed to effectively represent the chromoelectric confining string . in this context ,",
    "gauge models based on the @xmath5 spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) pattern are attractive ( see @xcite-@xcite , and refs . therein ) . in this case , the manifold of vacua is the coset @xmath6 ( the adjoint representation of @xmath0 ) , whose first homotopy group is @xmath7 .",
    "then , the confining string would be represented by a smooth _ center _ vortex , thus naturally leading to @xmath3-ality .",
    "furthermore , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lack of _ isolated _ monopoles , due to the trivial @xmath8 of the compact group @xmath9 , can be interpreted as the absence of gluons in asymptotic states . however , monopoles may interpolate center vortices with different fundamental weights to form hybrid mesons , that is , a colourless quark / valence gluon / antiquark confined state .",
    "the detailed knowledge we have about interquark lattice potentials , for different groups and representations , makes us wonder what the natural dual superconductor could be . with this idea in mind ,",
    "the initial objective of this work is to look for and test appropriate numerical methods to solve the center vortex field equations .",
    "these tools will permit , in a forthcoming work , to contrast different proposals with existing lattice data , obtained from monte carlo simulations .",

    "this special point in parameter space will certainly serve as a place to start exploring the model , and verify its suitableness to accommodate the various lattice data .",
    "bps bounds in a non abelian context were previously obtained in the bosonic sector of @xmath13 supersymmetric theories . for the embedding of @xmath14-vortices , a @xmath15 gauge field coupled to one adjoint and @xmath3 fundamental scalar fields was considered @xcite . for relativistic center vortices ,",

    "as a consequence , in that work , all bps solutions had zero energy . here , we have shown that to get a bps bound at @xmath343 , @xmath342 , the model requires no alignment term .",
