    "the explosive large - scale northwest - southeast outflow in the orion - kl region is one of the best studied but probably also least understood outflows in the sky .",
    "no other region shows that many h@xmath2 bow shocks distributed in a fan - like fashion with red- and blue - shifted emission features on both sides of the central region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the molecular emission as traced in co shows extremely broad line - wings up to @xmath3kms@xmath4 , but the morphological structure has so far been unclear and difficult to match closely to the h@xmath2 outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to this outflow , also known as the high - velocity outflow , there exists a second outflow in the northeast - southwest direction which was first detected by h@xmath2o maser emission and which is often labeled as the low - velocity outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the major question is which sources drive the different outflows .",
    "while originally the infrared source irc2 was a suspect , it was soon realized that one of the prime powering sources of the region is the very close - by radio source _ i _",
    "this source is the site of vibrationally excited sio maser emission , and the orientation of these masers allowed different interpretations of the associated outflow direction . while early work favored source _",
    "i _ to drive the large - scale northwest - southeast outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) , more recent work on the maser data indicates that it rather belongs to the low - velocity northeast - southwest outflow @xcite .",
    "the latter interpretation finds additional support in thermal sio observations that show an elongated structure centered on source _ i _ with an orientation also in the northeast - southwest ( @xcite , see also fig .",
    "[ sio ] ) . since thermal sio emission",
    "is usually attributed to shocks within outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the combination of the thermal and maser sio emission strongly favors source _ i _ as the driving source of the low - velocity northeast - southwest outflow .",
    "n _ has also been discussed as a possible driving source of the northeast - southwest low - velocity outflow .",
    "it shows an elongation along position angle 100130@xmath5 in the mid - infrared which could be due to a disk @xcite , and a roughly perpendicular elongation in the radio at 8.4ghz which may be caused by an outflow @xcite .",
    "the relationship between sources _",
    "i _ and _ n _ in driving the northeast - southwest outflow(s ) is unknown ( for a discussion see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "that leaves as an open question which source is the culprit for driving the large - scale high - velocity northwest - southeast outflow ?",
    "@xcite recently suggested that this outflow may be powered by the dynamical decay of a massive star system , but other scenarios are possible as well .",
    "based on low - resolution data , @xcite proposed the existence of another luminous source approximately @xmath6 south of source _ i_.",
    "this source was unambiguously identified in the first sub - arcsecond resolution 865@xmath7 m submm continuum image obtained with the submillimeter array ( sma ) , and henceforth labeled sma1 ( @xcite , see also fig .",
    "[ sio ] ) .",
    "follow - up sma observations at 440@xmath7 m detected the source at these shorter wavelengths as well @xcite . in this work",
    "we show that the high - velocity gas , as traced by c@xmath0o , apparently traces back to this relatively unknown source rather than to sources _",
    "orion - kl was observed with the sma in the compact configuration simultaneously at 690ghz and 230ghz on 2005 february 19th . to accomplish the high - frequency observations the weather conditions were excellent with zenith opacities @xmath8 between 0.03 and 0.04 throughout the night .",
    "the phase center was the nominal position of source _ i _",
    "r.a.(j2000 ) 05h35m14.50s and decl.(j2000 ) 05@xmath9 , and the @xmath10 was @xmath115kms@xmath4 .",
    "the double - sideband receivers covered the frequency ranges 218.85 to 220.85ghz and 228.85 to 230.85ghz .",
    "the phase was calibrated with regularly interleaved observations of the quasar 0607 - 157 , flux and bandpass calibration were performed with callisto observations . the high - frequency data along with more observational details are published in @xcite , here we are only interested in a small subset of the low - frequency data .",
    "complimentary c@xmath0o(21 ) data were obtained with the 9 pixel hera array on the iram 30 m telescope in september 2007 .",
    "the observations covered a region of @xmath12 around source _ i _ and were conducted in the on - the - fly mode with on - source integration times per position of @xmath113.7secs .",
    "the off - source reference position was @xmath13 east of source _ i_. the single - dish data were converted to visibilities and subsequently processed with the sma data within the miriad package using standard tools ( e.g. , uvmodel ) .",
    "the weighting of the two datasets was chosen to recover large - scale emission but maintain at the same time the high spatial resolution to resolve small - scale structure .",
    "the synthesized beam of the combined data is @xmath14 , and the @xmath15 rms per 5kms@xmath4 channel is @xmath1150mjybeam@xmath4 .",
    "the whole low - frequency sma dataset will be presented in a forthcoming publication by nissen et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , here we are only interested in the c@xmath0o(21 ) emission . although the sma and iram30 m observations also covered the more abundant isotopologues @xmath16co(21 ) and @xmath17co(21 )",
    ", in orion - kl it turns out that because of their high optical depth these two lines strongly suffer from confusion problems with the ambient cloud complicating any interpretation of the data .",
    "in contrast to that , the rarer isotopologue c@xmath0o(21 ) penetrates the ambient cloud more deeply and hence traces the outflow associated gas far better , allowing us a deeper analysis of the outflow structure , its mass flow rate , kinematics and energetics , as well as pinpointing the likely driving source .",
    "[ channel ] presents the combined sma+30 m c@xmath0o(21 ) channel map . excluding the channels with strongest emission closest to the @xmath10 ( approximately four channels between 0 and 15kms@xmath4 ) , two main features can be distinguished in the remaining channels :    \\(1 ) the large - scale gas emission exhibits a v - shaped cone - like open structure to the northwest , particularly prominent in the red - shifted channels @xmath18kms@xmath4 but also visible in the blue - shifted channels between @xmath19 and @xmath20kms@xmath4 .",
    "this cone - like structure approximately encompasses the main features of shocked strong h@xmath2 emission in this direction ( fig .",
    "[ c18o_h2 ] ) .",
    "finding both blue- and red - shifted gas to the northwest indicates a wide opening angle of the flow where the main outflow axis is not too far from the plane of the sky .",
    "the less pronounced emission to the southeast was already previously observed , and @xcite argue that the outflow may be blocked in this direction by the hot core @xcite actually extends further southeast of sma1 than indicated by the hot core continuum peak in fig .",
    "the proposed blocking of the outflow by the hot core may also be responsible for some of the large - scale asymmetries of the h@xmath2 emission . ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the main southeastern emission features are well correlated with a lack of h@xmath2 emission indicating particularly high column densities in this direction .",
    "furthermore , we find high - velocity gas toward the southwest and northeast ( fig .",
    "[ c18o_h2 ] ) .",
    "since @xcite find h@xmath2 emission with velocities up to 40kms@xmath4 toward the southwest as well , it is likely that this high - velocity gas is associated with the low - velocity outflow .",
    "\\(2 ) we find that the high - velocity gas on the blue- and red - shifted side of the spectrum traces back to the source sma1 .",
    "although the synthesized beam is larger than the spatial separation of source _ i _ and sma1 ( @xmath21or @xmath11830au ) , the peak positions can be determined with a much higher spatial accuracy depending on the signal - to - noise ratio s / n . for point sources , one can in principle achieve an accuracy of 0.45hpbw/(s / n ) @xcite , however , this may be less applicable for extended emission like c@xmath0o in this case .",
    "the channel with the lowest s / n ratio still detects the main peak position toward sma1 at higher than @xmath22 values ( at @xmath23kms@xmath4 ) . for a point source , this would imply that the peak positions could be determined to better than @xmath24 .",
    "although the c@xmath0o emission is more extended , the shape of the high - velocity gas close to sma1 can to first order be described by a two - dimensional gaussian .",
    "therefore , being more conservative for the c@xmath0o high - velocity gas , it should still be possible to infer the emission peak positions to an accuracy of better than @xmath25 . based on this ,",
    "the blue- and red - shifted high - velocity gas is spatially mainly associated with sma1 , and not with the previously often discussed sources _ i _ or _",
    "n_.    the blue- and red - shifted maps shown in figure [ c18o_h2 ] ( integrated from @xmath26 to @xmath19 and from 22.5 to 37.5kms@xmath4 , respectively ) can be used to calculate the masses , kinematic and energetic parameters of the outflow following @xcite ( time - scale @xmath27 , outflow rate @xmath28 , momentum rate @xmath29 , and energy @xmath30 ) .",
    "assuming optically thin c@xmath0o(21 ) emission at 30k with a c@xmath0o / h@xmath2 conversion factor of @xmath31 @xcite , the derived values are given in table [ parameters ] . while the masses have uncertainties of approximately a factor 5 , the kinematic and energetic values are uncertain within an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the derived masses , outflow and momentum rates are at the upper end of typically found massive outflows , whereas the time - scale is relatively short ( compared with the outflow sample in @xcite ) .",
    "the large - scale cone - like morphology of the c@xmath0o outflow approximately following the h@xmath2 bow - shock emission in the northwest direction suggests that c@xmath0o and h@xmath2 are tracing the same outflow .",
    "furthermore , the spatial association of the c@xmath0o high - velocity emission with the submm source sma1 indicates that sma1 may harbor the driving source of the enigmatic large - scale orion - kl outflow .",
    "only the combination of the single - dish 30 m data , tracing the large - scale structure , with the sma high - spatial - resolution observations allows us to see all relevant structures and to trace the outflow back to pinpoint its origin .    in combination with the thermal and maser sio data , we suggest that the two driving sources of the two known outflows can be identified : ( 1 ) sma1 may host the driving source of the large - scale northwest - southeast high - velocity outflow , whereas ( 2 ) source _ i _ is likely the origin of the northeast - southwest low - velocity outflow .",
    "the nature of source _ i _ has been subject to many investigations for more than a decade ( e.g. , @xcite ) , however , we do not know much about sma1 .",
    "so far sma1 has only been detected at submm wavelengths ( 865 and 440@xmath7 m , @xcite ) but neither at shorter infrared nor at longer cm wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the submm - only detection is indicative of a very young age of the source which is supported by the short dynamical time - scale of the molecular outflow .",
    "although deriving a luminosity with just two data - points is impossible , based on the large outflow masses , it is likely that sma1 is in the process of forming a massive star .",
    "the non - detection at cm wavelengths could either be due to quenching of an underlying hypercompact hii region by very high accretion rates and/or gravitational trapping of the ionized gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or the source is still in such a young evolutionary phase that the central object has not yet enough ionizing flux to produce a detectable hypercompact hii region . in the framework of the recently proposed evolutionary sequence by @xcite , it may be an intermediate - mass protostar destined to become massive in the future .    assuming optically thin dust emission at 100k with a dust opacity index @xmath32 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the spatially resolved submm fluxes @xcite correspond to a gas mass and column density of @xmath110.1m@xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . while the large column densities confirm that this source is undetectable at near - infrared wavelengths with current instrumentation , at first sight the mass appears small",
    ". however , as discussed in @xcite , more than 90% of the total flux is filtered out by the sma observations , and hence the mass estimates are correspondingly unreliable .",
    "the total luminosity of the region of about @xmath35l@xmath33 ( e.g. , @xcite ) can not be produced by the sources previously discussed in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and it is well possible that sma1 contributes a significant fraction of the overall orion - kl luminosity .",
    "we note that the short dynamical outflow time - scale of the order @xmath1yrs is consistent with both recently discussed scenarios for the proper motions in this region : @xcite proposed that the recent passage of the bn - object has triggered the outflow burst in this region , whereas @xcite and @xcite suggest that a dynamically decaying multiple system is at the root of the observed proper motions .",
    "both events are suggested to have taken place about 500yrs ago .",
    "our data do not allow to differentiate between these scenarios , however , it is interesting that all recent observations are indicative of strong activity within the last @xmath1yrs ."
