    "the exciting discovery of a new particle at the lhc  @xcite raises many questions and creates new challenges .",
    "although current data indicate that the particle has properties close to what is expected from the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) , much larger data sets will be needed to determine whether it really is the higgs boson that completes the standard model or a particle that points to a new physics .",
    "a significant deviation in production cross sections or branching ratios in various channels from those predicted by the sm can be observed at any point .",
    "in addition , this particle could be accompanied by more higgs states .",
    "in well motivated theories beyond the sm the higgs sector is typically more complicated .",
    "models with two higgs doublets , for example the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) , contain five higgs bosons in the spectrum : light and heavy cp - even higgses , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the cp - odd higgs , @xmath0 , and a pair of charged higgs bosons , @xmath12 .",
    "singlet extensions of the two higgs doublet models , for example the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) , contain three cp - even higgs bosons , two cp - odd higgs bosons , and a pair of charged higgs bosons , and there are many simple models with even more complicated higgs sectors .",
    "it is usually the case that there is one higgs boson with properties ( couplings to @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons ) of the sm higgs , we refer to it as the sm - like higgs .",
    "however , such a higgs does not necessarily decay in the same way as the sm higgs , and a significant model dependence of decay modes applies to other higgses as well .",
    "it is well known that the presence of a light cp - odd higgs boson can modify the decay modes of heavier higgses .",
    "we study a scenario with the charged higgs lighter than the top quark , so that @xmath1 decay mode is present , and a light cp - odd higgs so that @xmath2 decay mode is open and can dominate .",
    "this scenario generically appears and is phenomenologically viable in singlet extensions of the two higgs doublet model with or without supersymmetry  @xcite . in order for our study to be applicable to a variety of models",
    "we only assume couplings of higgs bosons originating from doublets to fermions , gauge bosons , and other higgses according to the two higgs doublet model type ii ( supersymmetric models are of this type ) .",
    "the two cp - odd higgses originating from doublets and the singlet can mix , and thus the light cp - odd higgs is allowed to have an arbitrary doublet fraction .",
    "we do not assume any specific mass relations in higgs spectrum , and we do not include any kind of corrections originating from additional particles in specific models , such as susy corrections .",
    "we summarize experimental constraints from direct searches for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath2 followed by @xmath17 , and show that , as a result of @xmath2 dominance , this scenario is not constrained in a large range of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the doublet fraction of the cp - odd higgs .",
    "we do not impose any constraint from flavor changing rare decays ( e.g. @xmath18 , @xmath19 , etc . ) as they may strongly depend on other sectors of a complete model .",

    "the lhc study of search strategies based on leptonic decays of @xmath22s from @xmath17 , and a subleading decay mode of the cp - odd higgs , @xmath26 , is presented in section  [ sec : lhc ] .",

    "we conclude and discuss possible improvements of the analysis in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "formulas for decay widths are summarized in the appendix .",

    "this is because the strength of the @xmath37 interaction is given by the gauge coupling @xmath38 of @xmath39 which is much larger than yukawa couplings of the charm and strange quarks and of the tau lepton that control the decays modes to fermions . in models with more than one cp - odd higgs boson , _",
    "e.g. _ in singlet extensions of the two higgs doublet model , the @xmath37 coupling is proportional to the doublet component of the corresponding mass eigenstate : @xmath40    the partial width of the charged higgs boson decaying into tau lepton and neutrino is given by ( neglecting the mass of the tau ) @xmath41 while the partial width of the charged higgs boson decaying into @xmath13 boson and the cp - odd higgs , when kinematically possible , is given by ( neglecting the mass of the cp - odd higgs ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the doublet component of the cp - odd higgs mass eigenstate ( at the amplitude level ) .",

    "the @xmath2 mode is sizable only if the cp - odd higgs has a significant doublet component ; however as @xmath46 approaches 1 , @xmath2 dominates even if the cp - odd higgs has only @xmath47 doublet component ( i.e. @xmath48 ) . for @xmath49",
    "also the @xmath16 decay becomes relevant ; this , however , does not change our conclusions .",

    "we do not consider corrections to higgs couplings and masses that occur in specific models , e.g. in supersymmetric models . by minimizing the model dependence of our study ,",
    "all the results we obtain can be easily reinterpreted in a variety of models .",
    "nevertheless , in order to further motivate this scenario we demonstrate , in the following subsection , that it is also viable in supersymmetric models in which the higgs sector is more constrained .",
    "the scenario we discussed in the previous section occurs and is phenomenologically viable in the simplest extension of the mssm , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) , which adds only one singlet chiral superfield , @xmath52 .",
    "its particle content differs from the mssm by the addition of one cp - even and one cp - odd state in the neutral higgs sector ( assuming cp conservation ) , and one additional neutralino .",
    "apart from the usual quark and lepton yukawa couplings , the scale invariant superpotential @xmath53 depends on two dimensionless couplings @xmath54 and @xmath55 beyond the mssm .",
    "the associated soft susy breaking trilinear terms are @xmath56 ( hatted letters denote superfields , while unhatted correspond to their scalar components ) .",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm is described by these trilinear and soft trilinear couplings , together with two further input parameters , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the scenario that we consider hinges on several properties of the lightest cp - odd higgs .",
    "first of all , we need a cp - odd higgs lighter than @xmath62 gev so that it dominantly decays into @xmath63 .",
    "this can be achieved by approximate global symmetries ; for instance , in the @xmath64 symmetry limit of the nmssm , @xmath65 , the cp - odd higgs is exactly massless ( for more details and formulas , see e.g. ref .",
    "the second important property is the strength of its couplings to other higgses , gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "this is controlled by the doublet component of the lightest cp - odd higgs mass eigenstate , @xmath66 : @xmath67 for example , in the limit @xmath65 we find @xmath68 .",

    "( [ eq : h_to_aa ] ) depends strongly on the choice of parameters : it can be very small , or it can easily make @xmath20 to dominate for any @xmath35 even for very singlet - like cp - odd higgs boson .",
    "this was investigated in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite where the conditions under which @xmath20 dominates were studied .",
    "it was found that a non - zero soft trilinear couplings , especially @xmath81 , was crucial .",
    "for example , in the limit @xmath82 , the branching ratio @xmath20 is at most of order 10% while @xmath68 .",
    "this is an example of the parameter space in which the doublet component of the cp - odd higgs can be large enough for @xmath2 to dominate while @xmath83 is small .",

    "these choices are no longer phenomenologically viable . however , rising the superpartner masses above limits and increasing stop masses and mixing that would make the sm like higgs boson sufficiently heavy does not change our discussion since these parameters do not enter in branching ratios of the cp - even or charged higgs bosons .",
    "in addition , some scenarios in ref .",
    "@xcite had negligible @xmath83 , dominant @xmath2 , and a sm - like higgs in @xmath85 gev mass range . ]",
    "constraints on a light cp - odd higgs scenario come also from b factories and lhc data .",
    "these two sets of experimental results provide the strongest limits and thus we will not discuss other experimental constraints .    at b factories a light cp - odd higgs can be produced in upsilon decays , @xmath86 , with sizable rates in the nmssm  @xcite . at present , the strongest constraints come from babar  @xcite that sets limits on @xmath87 with @xmath6 at the level of @xmath88 and @xmath89 at the level of @xmath90 ( these are the strongest limits , the exact exclusion limits depend on the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson and are typically weaker as @xmath91 increases ) .    in addition , a cp - odd higgs can be directly produced at the lhc in the gluon fusion channel  @xcite .",
    "this search strategy has several advantages .",
    "a possible discovery does not rely on searches in higgs decays , for which the branching ratios are highly model dependent .",
    "moreover , this mode does not suffer from phase space limitations of searches in upsilon decays ( for @xmath91 approaching the mass of the upsilon ) . in spite of the large production cross section ,",

    "stronger limits come from cms which sets upper limits on the production cross section times decay branching ratio @xmath96 in the range of 1.57.5 pb  @xcite .",
    "both searches , @xmath97 with @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , are mainly sensitive to the coupling of the cp - odd higgs to down type fermions which is given by @xmath100 .",
