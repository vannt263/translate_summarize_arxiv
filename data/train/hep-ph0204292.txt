    "if the higgs mechanism is realized in nature , a complete determination of its properties is among the central tasks for future colliders . in particular , determining the @xmath13 properties of the higgs boson is one of the important goals of a future @xmath14 linear collider operating at a center - of - mass energy between @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 gev @xcite .",
    "different models , such as the standard model ( @xmath18 ) , the general two higgs doublet models ( 2@xmath19 ) , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( @xmath20 ) , and others predict different properties for the details of the higgs boson signature .",
    "it is of great importance to verify that , whatever scenario is realized in nature , the scientific program of a linear collider will be able to distinguish among these models .",
    "several methods have been proposed to distinguish between a scalar ( @xmath21 ) and a pseudoscalar ( @xmath22 ) spin zero higgs particle @xcite . in this study",
    "we investigate the case of a higgs boson which is light enough that the @xmath23 decay channel remains closed .",
    "then the most promising decay channel for the model independent parity determination is @xmath24 .",
    "it was previously proposed @xcite that the best @xmath1 decay channel for parity determination would be @xmath25 .",
    "the weakness of this method is that the higgs boson rest frame needs to be precisely reconstructed .    to address resolution issues",
    "it is necessary to perform monte carlo studies where the significant details of theoretical effects and detector conditions can be included . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have extended the algorithm of refs .",
    "@xcite for generating higgs decay ( independently from its production mechanism ) to the pair of @xmath1-leptons including the complete spin correlation matrix used in the subsequent decay of the @xmath1 leptons .",
    "the reaction chain @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; @xmath28 was studied .",
    "it was found that even small effects of smearing seriously deteriorate the measurement resolution .",
    "an independent study @xcite , using the pandora monte carlo generator of ref .",
    "@xcite confirms that result .",
    "this leaves no doubt that if we want to use the higgs boson @xmath1 decay channel for the measurement of the higgs parity , a better technique is required .    in this paper",
    "we continue to investigate higgs decay into a @xmath29 pair .",
    "we extend our study to the @xmath30 decay with @xmath31 ( _ i.e. _ the channel with the largest branching ratio ) and then @xmath32 .",
    "spin correlations are distributed over _ three _ levels of the decay chain .",
    "complicated geometrical distributions need to be defined .",
    "we have found the monte carlo method particularly useful already at the level of defining the observables .",
    "all of the main results are cross - checked using two independent analyses based on an extension of universal interface ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) for tauola , and with the pandora monte carlo generator  @xcite which is interfaced to pythia 6.1 @xcite for fragmentation and decay processes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical considerations which are used to understand the decay chain of the higgs particle are explained in section 2 where we also give some details of the tauola monte carlo simulation . in section 3",
    "we define the observable we use to distinguish between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs boson . in section 4",
    "we list our assumptions on smearing and we discuss imposed cuts , detector effects and necessary adaptations introduced into our observables .",
    "main numerical results are also given in this section .",
    "section 5 , a summary , closes the paper .",
    "the @xmath33 parity information must be extracted from the correlations between @xmath34 and @xmath35 spin components which are further reflected in correlations between the @xmath1 decay products in the plane transverse to the @xmath29 axes .",
    "this is because the decay probability , see @xcite , @xmath36 is sensitive to the @xmath37 polarization vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( defined in their respective rest frames ) .",
    "the symbols @xmath40/@xmath41 denote components parallel / transverse to the higgs boson momentum as seen from the respective @xmath37 rest frames .",
    "this suggests that the experimentally clean @xmath29 final state may be the proper instrument to study the parity of the higgs boson .",
    "the spin of the @xmath1 lepton is not directly observable but it manifests itself in the distributions of its decay products . depending on the decay channel , the polarimetric strength is different . the first monte carlo program for @xmath2 colliders where the density matrix of the @xmath1 lepton pair was used was koralb @xcite .",
    "let us recall some basic properties of that solution , which we have adopted to the case of the higgs boson decay in ref .",
    "the algorithm is organized in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "the @xmath1 lepton pair is generated and the @xmath1 leptons are decayed in their respective rest frames as if there were no spin effects at all . in the second step , the spin weight is calculated and rejection is performed . if the event is rejected , only the generation of the @xmath1 lepton decays is repeated .",
    "the spin weight is given by the following formula @xmath42 where , as a consequence of formula ( [ densi ] ) , the components @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( respectively for scalar and pseudoscalar ) and all other components are zero and @xmath46 . ] .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath47 decay channel .",
    "it is interesting because it has , by far , the largest branching ratio ( 25% ) .",
    "however , in comparison to @xmath48 decay , its polarimetric force is more than a factor of 2 smaller .",
    "it was found , see _ e.g. _ @xcite , that in many cases this can be improved if information on the @xmath49 decay products , _ i.e. _ on details of the decay @xmath50 , are used .",
    "this is of no surprise because the polarimetric vector is given by the formula @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a normalization function , @xmath53 is the difference of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 four - momenta and @xmath56 is the four - momentum of the @xmath1 neutrino ( all defined in the @xmath1 rest frame ) see , _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "obviously , any control on the vector @xmath53 can be advantageous .",
    "it is of interest to note that in the @xmath1 lepton rest frame , when @xmath57 is assumed , the term @xmath58 thus , to exploit this part of the polarimetric vector , we need to have some handle on the difference of the @xmath59 and @xmath55 energies in their respective @xmath1 leptons rest frames .",
    "otherwise , the effect of this part of the polarimetric vector cancels out and one is left with the part proportional to the @xmath49 ( equivalently @xmath60 ) momentum . without using the energy difference we would arrive at a case nearly identical to the one where the @xmath1 decays to a single @xmath61 except with the disadvantage that the coefficient diminishes the spin effects by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "already from this preliminary discussion we realize that the appropriate observable must rely on a distribution constructed out of at least 4 four - vectors .",
    "the monte carlo method is already essential at the level of designing the observable .",
    "our search for improvements of the results obtained in @xcite began with a study of acollinearity distributions defined in the higgs boson rest frame , when instead of the @xmath62 decay mode the mode @xmath63 was used .",
    "the difference between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs particle which was still visible for @xmath62 turned out to be practically invisible in the case of @xmath63 once detector smearings were introduced .",
    "we found these results rather discouraging , and we have turned our attention to another possibility . as inspiration we have used two methods , one used at lep 1 for the measurement of the @xmath1 polarization and another one , proposed for low energy @xmath2 colliders , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .      for the following discussion all the monte carlo samples have been generated with the tauola library @xcite .",
    "the photos @xcite monte carlo program could be used for generating radiative corrections in the decays of the higgs boson and @xmath1 leptons , but it was switched off . for the production of the @xmath1 lepton pairs",
    "the monte carlo program pythia 6.1 @xcite is used .",
    "the production process @xmath64 has been chosen with a higgs boson mass of @xmath65 @xmath66 and a center - of - mass energy of @xmath67 @xmath66 .",
    "the effects of initial state bremsstrahlung were included in the pythia generation .    for the @xmath1 lepton pair decay with full spin effects included in the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 chain ,",
    "the interface explained in ref .",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "it is an extended version of the standard universal interface of refs .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of confidence",
    "we have confirmed all numerical results presented in this paper with the second simulation using the pandora monte carlo generator  @xcite .",
    "in this section we advocate a new observable where we ignore the part of the polarimetric vector proportional to the @xmath49 ( equivalently @xmath60 ) momentum in the @xmath1 rest frame .",
    "we rely only on the part of the vector due to the differences of the @xmath59 and @xmath55 momenta , which manifests the spin state of the @xmath70 .    in the higgs rest frame",
    "the @xmath49 momentum represents a larger fraction of the higgs s energy than the neutrino .",
    "therefore , we abandon the reconstruction of the higgs rest frame and instead we use the @xmath71 rest frame which has the advantage that it is built only from directly visible decay products of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 . and higgs ( or @xmath74 ) rest frames which are difficult to measure . in our approach",
    ", these frames are replaced by others which are easily measured and yet retain significant sensitivity to the higgs parity . in some special cases",
    "our approach may open the way to studying the higgs parity at hadron machines such as the tevatron or the lhc . ]",
    "we take for both @xmath49 s the @xmath75 decay channel . in the rest frame of the @xmath71 system",
    "we define the acoplanarity angle , @xmath76 , between the two planes spanned by the immediate decay products ( the @xmath59 and @xmath55 ) of the two @xmath49 s .",
    "the variable @xmath76 alone does not distinguish the scalar and psuedoscalar higgs .",
    "to do this we must go further .",
    "the @xmath77 spin sensitivity is proportional to the energy difference of the charged and neutral pion ( in the @xmath1 rest frame ) , see formula ( [ formula ] ) .",
    "we have to separate events into two zones , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ,    @xmath80 @xmath81 where , @xmath82 + @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the @xmath85 energies in the respective @xmath37 rest frames .",
    "if the cuts are applied using the four - momenta from the generation level boosted to the @xmath1 rest frame without any smearing then we call them respectively @xmath86 and @xmath87 . if the cuts are applied using the smeared four - momenta boosted to the replacement @xmath37 rest frames ( defined below ) , then they are called @xmath88 and @xmath89 .

    "the right hand plot contains the events with the opposite signs for the two energy differences ( selection @xmath87 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the differences between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs boson are large .",

    "an event selection will be made from the data set to isolate higgsstrahlung events where the process @xmath0 occurred .",
    "this sample will be reconstructed and the distribution of the measured variable , @xmath106 , defined in sections 3 and 5 , will be compared with simulated reconstructed distributions for a scalar and a pseudoscalar higgs such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ acosm2 ] . a goodness of fit test such as an unbinned maximum likelihood will be performed for both hypotheses .",
    "one hypothesis will be favored over the other and statistical techniques will be applied to estimate the confidence level of the conclusion .",
    "for present purposes , it is important to note that the level of certainty obtained will depend upon the specific sample collected .",
    "another run under the same conditions with the same integrated luminosity would , in general , result in a sample of a different size and with different fit results due to the random sampling effects inherent in all measurements .",
    "thus , we can not a priori predict the level of certainty that will be achieved when the measurement is eventually made .",
    "however , we can simulate a large set of possible data samples that might be collected and gather some insight into the range of certainties possible .",
    "we have applied a binned maximum likelihood technique to a set of approximately 1300 simulated data samples where half the samples were derived from a @xmath13 even higgs and half from a @xmath13 odd higgs . the higgs mass was taken to be 120 gev , the beam energy was 250 gev per beam .",
    "the @xmath70 were reconstructed from their gammas and @xmath59 decay products .",
    "the @xmath59 were smeared 0.1@xmath107 in energy and direction , the gamma energy was smeared 15% and their direction by 2@xmath61/1800 , a typical calorimeter cell size .",
    "we assumed an integrated luminosity of 500 @xmath108 .",
    "beamsstrahlung and isr effects are included . to account for detector acceptance effects , event selection efficiency and impurity",
    "we assumed an overall efficiency of 60% .",
    "studies @xcite have shown these are realistic estimates of event selection efficiencies and purities .    based on these assumptions , using a binned likelihood fit and comparing each data sample with the distributions for a @xmath13 even and a @xmath13 odd higgs and comparing the resulting fits",
    ", we find that every data sample will identify the correct parent distribution with a confidence level of at least 95@xmath107 and 86@xmath107 of all samples will make the correct identification above the 3@xmath109 confidence level .",
    "thus , we see that we have an excellent chance of correctly determining the @xmath13 of the higgs with this technique .",
    "the technique is quite robust relative to the measurement resolutions of the charged pions and the gammas ( from the neutral pions ) .",
    "for example , decreasing the direction resolution of the gammas even by a factor up to six has a negligible effect on the overall measurement resolutions cited above .",
    "the @xmath76 plots show that the odd and even states have on average large angular differences , thus small errors in particle resolutions will not change @xmath76 of an event enough , to make a significant impact on the overall distribution .",
    "we have studied the possibility of distinguishing a scalar from a pseudoscalar couplings of light higgs to fermions using its decay to a pair of @xmath1 leptons and their subsequent decays to @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we have discussed an observable which is very promising . using reasonable assumptions about the @xmath112 production cross section and about the measurement resolutions we find that with 500 @xmath108 of luminosity at a 500 gev @xmath2 linear collider the @xmath13 of a 120 gev higgs can be measured to a confidence level greater than 95% . to confirm the method we have used two distinct monte carlo programs @xcite and @xcite and",
    "the observables were coded independently .",
    "we emphasize that the technique is both model independent and independent of the higgs production mechanism and depends only on good measurements of the higgs decay products .",
    "thus , this method may be applicable to other production modes including those available at proton colliders as well as at electron colliders .",
    "finally we note that several improvements are still possible . if , instead of unweighted events in our distributions as given in fig .",
    "[ acosm2 ] we use events weighted with @xmath113 ( see formula [ e - zone ] ) the statistical significance will increase , @xmath114 , @xmath115 . ] by a factor of about 1.5 . other multi - meson final states such as @xmath116 can be used to increase the statistical samples . as argued in",
    "@xcite they should lead to additional data of spin significance comparable to our @xmath117 channel ( if the appropriate observables are found ) .",
    "finally , we may expect that a measurement of the @xmath1 flight direction may turn out to be helpful , similarly as it was the case for the @xmath1 polarization measurement at lep 1 @xcite .",
    "for each new production mode that can be analyzed using this technique the sample size increases accordingly .",
    "we may expect the final statistical significance for the parity measurement to be at least factor of 2 - 3 times better than in our conclusions .",
    "such improvements will lead to more complex observables with many special cases and require good control of the systematic errors .",
    "we leave them to future studies but we think that , because of such possibilities , our estimation of the parity resolution will turn out to be largely conservative .",
    "discussions over the years with the experimental / phenomenological community analyzing @xmath1 lepton data were essential for creating the necessary background to start this work and we acknowledge the work of people involved in the tauola project , in particular p. golonka , s. jadach , j. khn and e. richter - was .",
