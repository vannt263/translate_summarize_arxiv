    "<S> we discuss resonance recombination for quarks and show that it is compatible with quark and hadron distributions in local thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate realistic heavy quark phase space distributions in heavy ion collisions using langevin simulations with non - perturbative @xmath0-matrix interactions in hydrodynamic backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> we hadronize the heavy quarks on the critical hypersurface given by hydrodynamics after constructing a criterion for the relative recombination and fragmentation contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the influence of recombination and flow on the resulting heavy meson and single electron @xmath1 and elliptic flow . </S>",
    "<S> we will also comment on the effect of diffusion of open heavy flavor mesons in the hadronic phase .    </S>",
    "<S> quark recombination has been identified as an important mechanism of hadronization in high energy nuclear collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for recombination can be seen in the large baryon / meson ratios and the quark - number scaling of elliptic flow @xmath2 at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first - generation recombination models that could explain these phenomena at intermediate transverse momenta @xmath3 gev/@xmath4 were based on so - called instantaneous quark coalescence . </S>",
    "<S> they lack explicit energy conservation and serious concerns arise if they are applied to low @xmath5 where the bulk of hadrons are produced .    </S>",
    "<S> hence it is important to understand how quark recombination in local kinetic equilibrium can be described . </S>",
    "<S> a promising formalism was put forward in @xcite based on a boltzmann equation for quarks and antiquarks scattering through resonances which resemble mesons . this resonance recombination model ( rrm ) </S>",
    "<S> conserves 4-momentum and exhibits detailed balance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the long - time limit of the boltzmann dynamics the mesons should acquire local thermal equilibrium with temperature and flow fields given by those of the equilibrated quark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we have numerically confirmed this assertion both for simple blastwaves with constant hadronization time @xcite , and for the non - trivial hadronization hypersurface of a hydrodynamic evolution of the quark phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence resonance recombination preserves local thermal equilibrium for arbitrary flow fields and for any realistic hypersurface . </S>",
    "<S> an important corollary is the fact that any quark - number or kinetic energy scaling at _ low _ hadron-@xmath5 is not due to quark recombination . </S>",
    "<S> local equilibration would not allow any microscopic information about hadronization to be detected , and we explicitely show in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite how a realistic flow field together with a reasonable freeze - out hierarchy for hadrons can mimic quark number- and kinetic energy scaling at rhic at _ low _ @xmath5 to good accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> heavy charm ( @xmath4 ) and bottom ( @xmath6 ) quarks have been widely discussed as ideal internal probes for quark gluon plasma , see @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> the large masses increase their thermalization times , and the degree of thermalization in heavy ion collisions encodes valuable information about their interactions with quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on our effort to set up a formalism that is consistently based on the notion of strongly coupled qgp , both for the diffusion of heavy quarks through qgp , and their hadronization through an appropriate superposition of recombination and fragmentation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter provides an opportunity to extend the resonance recombination formalism to quark distributions away from local thermal equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the heavy quarks in a background medium can be described by a relativistic implementation of the langevin equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the ideal , 2 + 1-d , boost - invariant hydro code azhydro @xcite to model the locally equilibrated background qgp medium . </S>",
    "<S> the drag and diffusion coefficients of the heavy quarks in the medium are calculated from non - perturbative @xmath0-matrix results on heavy - light quark interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-matrix approach exhibits feshbach resonances both in the color - singlet and color - triplet channel and leads to resonant interactions up to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant relaxation rates are substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding perturbative elastic rates . </S>",
    "<S> the initial heavy quark momentum spectra are taken from perturbative calculations cross - checked with measured @xmath8 semi - leptonic decay spectra @xcite , while the spatial distribution is determined by the binary collision density .    - and @xmath9-meson nuclear modification factors for semi - central au+au collisions at rhic compared to the @xmath4 and @xmath6 quark @xmath1 from which they originate.,width=283 ]    we employ a test particle method for our langevin simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that in the limit of very large ( unphysical ) relaxation rates our charm quark distributions approach the equilibrium given by the hydrodynamic background . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig:1 ] shows the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 for @xmath4 and @xmath6 quarks on the hadronization hypersurface ( given by azhydro ) calculated from our langevin with non - perturbative @xmath0-matrix coefficients for semi - central collisions at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> we observe about 60% quenching for charm quarks at large momenta @xmath10 which is reflected in an excess at small @xmath10 due to conservation of heavy quarks . </S>",
    "<S> suppression for @xmath6 is significantly smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> hadronization of heavy quarks should proceed through coalescence with light quarks from the medium if heavy - light scattering rates are large enough to allow for such interactions in the color - singlet channel during the pertinent time interval ( e.g.  the duration of the mixed phase ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if such heavy - light interactions are rare , e.g.  at large @xmath10 , independent fragmentation of the heavy quark should occur . for a given heavy quark momentum in its local fluid rest frame we estimate the scattering rate @xmath11 in the color singlet channel in the @xmath0-matrix approach at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we approximate the coalescence probability through @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 if the product exceeds one ) . in practice </S>",
    "<S> we boost the rates into the lab frame and apply them as a function of heavy quark @xmath10 with @xmath15 fm/@xmath4 ( motivated by the fact that this time interval is well below the duration of the mixed phase in azhydro ) which leads to @xmath16 at vanishing @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this approach treats the interactions of heavy quarks in the medium and their hadronization using the same non - pertrubative dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it also ensures that @xmath17 for very large @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate @xmath18 for each test particle and apply fragmentation or resonance recombination accordingly .    </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig:1 ] provides @xmath1 for both @xmath19 and @xmath9 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that resonance recombination provides a significant enhancement of both radial and elliptic flow . </S>",
    "<S> the former can be seen from the prominent flow `` bump '' developing in @xmath1 for @xmath19 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> resonance recombination acts as an additional interaction of heavy quarks with the medium , making a noticeable contribution to further equilibration . in figure [ fig:3 ] </S>",
    "<S> we display @xmath1 and @xmath2 of electrons from semi - leptonic decays of @xmath19 and @xmath9 mesons , compared to experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with data is favorable if one keeps in mind two facts : azhydro is tuned to kinetic freeze - out and exhibits too little radial flow around @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes obvious if the results with azhydro are compared to those using a fireball parameterization with the correct radial flow at @xmath12 ( see @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we expect an increase in elliptic flow of about 20 - 30% in the hadronic phase . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently calculated relaxation rates of charm in a hadron gas and have found that at @xmath12 the results tend to be close to those of the @xmath0-matrix calculation in qgp @xcite . </S>",
