    "on 27 october 2000 , the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory detected a highly variable x - ray flare coincident with the position of sagittarius a * ( baganoff et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the transient lasted a couple of hours , with a peak luminosity @xmath0 times greater than the quiescent emission .",
    "even more surprising was the realization that during the event , the x - ray output dropped abruptly by a factor of five in under ten minutes , recovering just as quickly .",
    "light travel - time arguments therefore place the source of this unusual radiation within a region no bigger than about 10 light - minutes or @xmath1 cm across .",
    "sagittarius a * , a compact radio source at the galactic center , is thought to be the radiative manifestation of a @xmath2 supermassive black hole with the schwarzschild radius @xmath3 cm , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the gravitational constant , the black hole mass and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "earlier theoretical modeling of its spectrum and polarization properties ( melia , liu , and coker 2000 , 2001 ; see also falcke and markoff 2000 for an alternative model in which this emission is produced within a jet ) had already anticipated an emission region within the inner ten schwarzschild radii of a hot , magnetized keplerian flow .",
    "not long after _",
    "chandra s _ first detection of the x - ray flare , xmm-_newton _ followed with its own measurements , including the discovery of two unusually strong bursts a couple of years later ( goldwurm et al .",
    "2003 ; porquet et al .",
    "none of the previous x - ray satellites had the sensitivity and spatial resolution to identify such low - luminosity events at the distance of the galactic center .",
    "_ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ now detect them at a rate of about one per day , most of which are usually weak and last tens of minutes .",
    "the best - fit photon index during the majority of these bursts is @xmath7 , representing a flattening of about 1 compared to sagittarius a * s spectrum in the quiescent state , which includes a significant contribution from thermal emission at large radii ( melia 1992 ; baganoff et al .",
    "in addition , the 27 october 2000 event appears to show a soft - hard - soft spectral evolution .",
    "but the most intriguing x - ray flare of all may actually be the most recently detected event , in which an unambiguous modulation with an average period of @xmath8 minutes was seen over the course of its @xmath9 hour duration ( belanger et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the separation between the flux minimums actually decreases from about @xmath10 down to @xmath11 minutes as the flare evolves , corresponding to the passage of an emitting plasma in a keplerian motion from a radius @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "this region therefore appears to lie somewhat below the marginally stable orbit ( mso ) for a non - spinning black hole ; it would , however , be outside the mso for a kerr black hole with a large spin .",
    "the monotonic decrease of the x - ray period is strongly reminiscent of what was seen in near - ir ( nir ) flares detected just a few years earlier , where an average period of @xmath14 minutes was associated with a similar chirping behavior with the period decreasing from 23 to 13 minutes ( genzel et al .",
    "2003 ) . these two sets of observations ",
    "one ground - based in the nir , the other at x - ray energies from space  support the view that we are probably witnessing the evolution of an event moving inwards through the last portion of the accretion disk inside or very near the mso .",
    "the inferred radial velocity @xmath15 cm s@xmath16 is consistent with an accretion driven by the magnetic viscosity of the turbulent keplerian flow .",
    "not surprisingly , previous speculation on the underlying mechanism for these events ( liu and melia 2002 ) focused on the view that such x - ray flares might be driven by an accretion instability . while this may still be true in light of all the more recent observations , the process by which the actual emission occurs is uncertain .",
    "however , the fact that the nir spectrum ( eisenhauer et al . 2005 ) is much steeper than that of its x - ray counterpart excludes a direct extrapolation of the spectrum ( see liu and melia 2001 and fig .",
    "[ fig2.ps ] below ) .",
    "the currently favored scenario is one in which the mm / sub - mm to nir portion of the spectrum is due to synchrotron , whereas the x - rays are produced by synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) .",
    "( this constraint is empirically motivated , and is independent of whether the emission occurs within a disk or a jet . )",
    "it turns out that producing the right blend of physical conditions to fit both the nir and x - ray flare emission ( under the assumption that the two occur more or less simultaneously  a concept that is yet to be confirmed compellingly ) is not trivial . in the next section",
    "we describe the observational constraints on the model parameters under this scenario .",
    "our work with stochastic acceleration ( sa ) in producing sagittarius a * s quiescent spectrum ( liu , petrosian , and melia 2004 , lpm04 hereafter ; liu , melia , and petrosian 2005 ) motivates us to consider a picture in which the flare itself is produced by a magnetic event , possibly driven by an accretion instability . a toy model of this acceleration and its fit to the flare spectra",

    "the nir and x - ray flares in sagittarius a * have peak luminosities as high as @xmath17 ergs s@xmath16 ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 ; ghez et al .",
    "several relatively long duration flares , two in the nir ( genzel et al . 2003 ) and another in x - rays ( belanger et al .",
    "2005 ) , also displayed quasi - periodic modulations with a period decreasing from @xmath18 to @xmath19 minutes as the flare evolved .",
    "assuming keplerian motion , this corresponds to a transition in radius from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "two flares have also been observed simultaneously in the nir and x - ray bands , with a peak x - ray luminosity , respectively , 3 and 18 times the quiescent level of @xmath22 ergs s@xmath16 and their spectroscopy still being processed ( eckart et al .",
    "2004 ; baganoff et al .",
    "the first nir spectroscopy was completed in july 2004 : a power - law fit to the power spectrum @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 the emission frequency ) yields @xmath25 during the peak of the flare observed july 15 , 2004 , and @xmath26 during the rising and decay phases . for the flare of july 17 , 2004 , @xmath27 ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "if the nir emission is produced via the synchrotron process , the radiating electron distribution @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 the lorentz factor ) must have an index @xmath30 , suggesting an exponential cutoff of the electron distribution presumably dictated by the acceleration process , at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the electron gyrofrequency , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the electron charge , mass and the perpendicular magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the x - ray flares , on the other hand , often display a very hard spectrum with @xmath36 ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 ; goldwurm et al .",

    "( this is different from a power - law commonly assumed , or a broken power - law distribution caused by radiative cooling . ) at the longer sub - mm wavelength the flares usually have a much smaller flux increase above their quiescent value than the nir flares , which suggests a photon spectral index @xmath38 , requiring a flattening of the electron distribution at lower energies . as we shall show below a fairly flat power - law spectrum with an exponential cutoff @xmath39",

    "the observed emission characteristics can then set strict limits on the model parameters , such as the source size @xmath43 , the magnetic field @xmath44 , the gas density @xmath45 , and @xmath40 .    before describing the acceleration model",
    "we discuss how the existing observations limit the possible ranges of these parameters . as mentioned above the very steep nir spectrum",
    "requires the cutoff frequency of the synchrotron emission @xmath46 hz in the sub - mm to nir range ( eisenhauer et al . 2005 ) .",

    "flares are likely triggered by some plasma instability , or by changes in the dynamics of the accretion flow  for example , the dissipation of angular momentum is different above and below the mso , which may lead to a strong gravitational dissipation and acceleration of electrons .",
    "it is important to note that the total number of energetic electrons required to produce these bright flares can set a limit on the mass accretion rate @xmath83 and accretion time @xmath84 @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the proton mass .",
    "if @xmath87 , then @xmath88 which is consistent with the value inferred from sagittarius a * s quiescent state spectrum and can account for the observed flares for a radiation efficiency of @xmath89 .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the sa of electrons and examine how this process meets the challenges posed by the above constraints .",
    "electrons can be accelerated by turbulent plasma waves via the transit - time damping process and cyclotron resonances .",
    "the former dominates in plasmas where the gas pressure is higher than the magnetic field pressure ( yan & lazarian 2004 ) , and the pitch angle scattering rate is higher than the acceleration rate when the alfvn velocity @xmath90 ( schlickeiser & miller 1998 ) , resulting in an isotropic electron distribution . the corresponding acceleration rate is proportional to the electron energy , giving rise to an energy independent acceleration time : @xmath91 which is determined by the turbulence generation length @xmath92 , @xmath60 , and @xmath93 ( miller , larosa , & moore 1996 , where the acceleration rate @xmath77 ( not to be confused with the source surface area defined above ) is given by equation 2.4a in the paper . ] ) .",
    "the sa can therefore be addressed by solving the following kinetic equation for the spatial and pitch angle integrated electron distribution function @xmath94 ( petrosian and liu 2004 ) @xmath95-{n\\over t_{\\rm",
    "esc}}+ \\dot{q}\\,,\\ ] ] where the source term @xmath96 and @xmath97 give the rate of particles entering and escaping from the acceleration site , which we identify as the emission region . as we shall see below , the energy density of energetic electrons is at least one order of magnitude higher than the magnetic field energy density .",
    "we therefore envision that the plasma is excited by certain internal instability . in such a scenario , the escape time @xmath98 can be much longer than the duration of the flare . for a constant injection rate @xmath99 with @xmath100 ,",
    "where @xmath101 the steady - state spectrum cuts off exponentially above @xmath40 but is different from the maxwellian one ( park & petrosian 1995 ; schlickeiser 1984 ) : @xmath102 the left panel of figure [ fig2.ps ] shows this distribution for @xmath103 and for several values of @xmath104 as indicated .",
    "the solid line gives the maxwellian distribution .",

    "the simplest model for production of x - ray is ssc model , but it faces several challenges . in this paper we have shown how the simultaneous observation of nir and x - ray flares may be used to determine the source size , the magnetic field , and the distribution of electrons , should the nir and x - ray emission be produced , respectively , via synchrotron and ssc .",
    "we have shown that the emission characteristics suggest an electron distribution cutting off at @xmath133 .",
    "the size of the source must be a fraction of a schwarzschild radius in order to produce prominent x - ray flares .",
    "the rapid rise in the nir emission suggests a magnetic field of a few tens of gauss .",
    "a lower magnetic field is required should the source be doppler - boosted , producing flares with soft nir and hard x - ray spectra .",
    "we have demonstrated that the sa model we proposed previously is fully consistent with the current observation of flares from sagittarius a * , and with the transit - time damping acceleration taking the place of the parallel propagating waves we used before , the acceleration only depends on the turbulence energy density .",
    "however , depending on details of the flare excitation mechanism , the electron distribution below @xmath40 can be quite different .",
    "this model therefore can be a powerful tool in probing the plasma energization and particle acceleration processes near the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "the rest frame acceleration time is slightly longer than the typically observed rise time .",
    "this suggests that a time - dependent treatment of the sa model is necessary unless the emitting plasma is doppler - boosted by a boosting factor @xmath134 .",
    "however , our main conclusions still hold  current observations can not yet distinguish the subtle difference .",
    "nevertheless , such a calculation is clearly warranted with the acquisition of new data , particularly as flares continue to be observed simultaneously across the spectrum .",
    "it is also interesting to note that should the magnetic field be anchored to a slow large scale flow , it will exert a stress on the plasma .",
    "this stress causes transport of the angular momentum of the emitting plasma . in a newtonian potential where the angular momentum density in a keplerian orbit is given by @xmath135",
    ", we have @xmath136 or @xmath137 which is comparable to the keplerian velocity at @xmath138 and is much higher than the radial velocity @xmath139 cm s@xmath16 suggested by the chirping behavior of the x - ray and nir flares , indicating that the variation length scale of this external magnetic field should be much longer than @xmath43 , or that most of the magnetic field is generated within the plasma itself . should neither of these scenarios be viable , a large black hole spin would then be required .",
    "this model is also in line with our previous study of sagittarius a * s emission in the quiescent state ( lpm04 ) , and with our study of proton and electron acceleration on larger scales ( @xmath140 ; liu , melia , and petrosian 2005 ) .",
    "clearly an appropriate modeling of the magnetic field structure in the accretion flow of sagittarius a * , and in any possible outflow , is required in order for us to have a complete understanding of this intriguing object . with it",

    "<S> recent near - ir ( nir ) and x - ray observations of sagittarius a * s spectrum have yielded several strong constraints on the transient energization mechanism , justifying a re - examination of the stochastic acceleration model proposed previously for these events . we here demonstrate that the new results are fully consistent with the acceleration of electrons via the transit - time damping process . but more importantly </S>",
    "<S> , these new nir and x - ray flares now can constrain the source size , the gas density , the magnetic field , and the wave energy density in the turbulent plasma . </S>",
    "<S> future simultaneous multi - wavelength observations with good spectral information will , in addition , allow us to study their temporal evolution , which will eventually lead to an accurate determination of the behavior of the plasma just minutes prior to its absorption by the black hole . </S>"
