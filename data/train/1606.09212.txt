    "the existence and uniqueness of measure for the navier - stokes equations has been the subject of much recent research , with the main focus being unique time - invariant measure .",
    "a major advance was achieved in @xcite where it was shown that , under a random bounded kick - type force , the navier - stokes system on the torus ( bounded domains with smooth boundaries and periodic boundary conditions ) has a unique time - invariant measure . in subsequent publications ( see @xcite ) the argument was refined to a more flexible coupling approach , which has extended the argument to white noise case , time - periodic cases ( see @xcite ) and the equations on the sphere ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , for true meteorological considerations it is also necessary to consider the equations under a fully time - dependent deterministic forcing .",
    "while this does , in general , negate the question of existence of time - independent measure , the question of uniqueness and the rate of convergence is still of interest .    in this paper",
    "the previous results mentioned are extended to include time - dependent deterministic forces . in order to keep the presentation simple and to highlight similarities between the time - dependent case and previous work ,",
    "we use a random perturbation activated by a dirac function as in @xcite instead of a random perturbation activated by an indicator function as in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we include a more general case of a squeezing - type property of the deterministic equations similar to one used in @xcite , which can allow for more general time - dependent deterministic forces .",
    "the first section presents the main result of the paper , proving a theorem that extends the coupling argument in @xcite to time - dependent forces .",
    "in particular , it is shown that for an inhomogeneous markov process that has nonzero probability of coming arbitrarily close together in finite time ( see condition [ controllability ] ) and has a coupling between each time step that has a positive probability of being half the initial distance apart ( see condition [ thisisacouplinglemma ] ) then the associated probability measures are exponentially mixing ( converge exponentially ) .",
    "thus , regardless for any initial distribution , there is only one limiting measure .",
    "it should be mentioned that different but equivalent conditions are used to show uniqueness of measure in @xcite .",
    "the conditions chosen here are to highlight the dependence on the behavior of the underlying deterministic system .",
    "the second section presents an application of the main result to the navier - stokes equations on the sphere .",
    "a combination of the approaches in @xcite are used to first define the deterministic navier - stokes equations in the navier - stokes equations on the sphere , giving special attention a couple of specific examples of deterministic forcing that guarantee that condition [ controllability ] holds .",
    "the perturbed equations are then described and conditions are given that guarantee condition [ controllability ] without the necessity of a globally attracting solution are presented .",
