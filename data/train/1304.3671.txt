    "the best known quadratic lower bound  @xcite . closing",
    "this gap has been in the computational geometry lore for many years , and is considered as one of the major ( and very difficult ) problems in the field ; see @xcite .",
    "the instances of the general problem for which the number of discrete changes in @xmath4 is provably sub - cubic , are strikingly few .",
    "it is worth mentioning the result of koltun @xcite which deals with sets of points moving along straight lines with equal speeds such that all points start their motion from a fixed line . in this particular case",
    "one can show that any four points are co - circular at most twice , and any three points are co - linear at most once .",

    "we believe that our results constitute a substantial progress towards establishing nearly quadratic ( or just sub - cubic ) bounds for more general instances of the problem , such as the simple and natural instance of points moving along straight lines with equal speeds . in this case",
    "any four points admit at most _ three _ co - circularities , and any triple of points can be collinear at most twice .",

    "informally , this happens because the delaunayhood of @xmath26 is violated by @xmath27 and @xmath28 : any disc whose boundary contains @xmath10 and @xmath13 contains at least one of the points @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath26 does not re - enter @xmath4 after time @xmath22 , we can charge the event at time @xmath22 to the edge @xmath26 .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath26 is again delaunay at some moment @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , at that moment the delaunayhood of @xmath26 is no longer violated by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "before this happens , either at least one of @xmath27 or @xmath28 must hit @xmath26 , or an additional co - circularity of @xmath31 must occur during @xmath32 . using our assumption that @xmath31 induce at most two co - circularity events ,",
    "we can guarantee ( up to a reversal of the time axis ) that the co - circularity at time @xmath22 is the last co - circularity of these four points .",
    "thus , one of @xmath29 , let it be @xmath27 , must cross @xmath26 during @xmath32 .",

    "this is done in a fairly general setting , where any four points of @xmath0 can be co - circular , and any three points of @xmath0 can be collinear , at most constantly many times . along the way , we establish several structural results which ( as we believe ) are of independent interest .    in section [ sec : delcocircs ] we use the general machinery of section [ sec : prelim ] to obtain a recurrence formula for @xmath33 in the case where any four points of @xmath0 are co - circular at most twice . recall that @xmath26 leaves @xmath4 at such a delaunay co - circularity , at some time @xmath22 , in order to re - enter @xmath4 at some later time @xmath30 , and @xmath26",

    "such delaunay co - circularities contribute a nearly quadratic term to the overall recurrence formula ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . similarly , if we find a  shallow \" collinearity of @xmath38 and another point ( one halfplane bounded by the line of collinearity contains at most @xmath36 points ) we charge the disappearance of @xmath26 to this collinearity . a combination of the clarkson - shor technique with the known near - quadratic bound on the number of topological changes in the convex hull of @xmath0 ( see ( * ? ?",
    "* section 8.6.1 ) ) yields a near - quadratic bound in this case .",
    "it thus remains to bound the number of delaunay co - circularities for which @xmath10 and @xmath13 participate in fewer  shallow \" co - circularities and in no  shallow \" collinearity during @xmath32 . in this case , using the general properties established in section [ sec : prelim ] , one can restore the delaunayhood of @xmath26 throughout @xmath32 by removal of some subset @xmath39 of @xmath40 points of @xmath0 . in particular , the point @xmath27 , which crosses @xmath26 , must belong to @xmath39 .",
