    "the connection between bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking ( gsb ) is often taken for granted , usually with the following argument that appeals to bogoliubov s pioneering work @xcite : bec means that in the thermodynamic limit the density @xmath3 of particles in the mode of lowest momentum @xmath1 is different from zero .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry , on the other hand , is associated with the non - vanishing of @xmath4 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "here it is important that the expectation value is understood in the sense of bogoliubov s quasi averages , i.e. , with a symmetry breaking field that is taken to zero _ after _ the thermodynamic limit . by the cauchy - schwarz inequality",
    ", we always have @xmath5 .",
    "thus gsb implies bec . on the other hand ,",
    "if bec holds , the macroscopic occupation of the zero mode is claimed to justify the replacement of the operators @xmath2 and @xmath6 by c - numbers and hence equating @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "therefore bec and gsb are equivalent .",
    "a rigorous justification of of bogoliubov s @xmath0-number substitution is not a trivial matter , however , and the reasoning above is clearly not a mathematical proof . in a classic paper @xcite , that is less known in the physics community than it deserves ,",
    "ginibre established the validity of the substitution as far as the computation of the pressure in the thermodynamic limit is concerned . as ginibre pointed out , it is not necessary to assume macroscopic occupancy of the zero mode ( although the substitution is only a useful computational tool if this is the case . ) in a recent paper @xcite ( see also @xcite , appendix d ) we presented a simple and general proof of the exactness of @xmath0-number substitutions in bosonic hamiltonians in the thermodynamic limit , using the berezin - lieb inequality @xcite ( which was only derived after ginibre s paper appeared ) .",
    "we then proved the equivalence of gsb and bec , where the expectation values are defined as quasi averages in the sense of bogoliubov , and moreover that bec in the standard sense _ without _ a symmetry breaking field implies bec in the quasi average sense and hence gsb .",
    "this last statement , although intuitively plausible @xcite , does not seem to have been rigorously verified before . in brief",
    ": @xmath9 the present contribution to the proceedings of the 21st max born symposium gives an account of the proof . for comparison and for pedagogical reasons",
    "we start by recalling briefly the connection between spontaneous symmetry breaking and off - diagonal long range order for a model of a ferromagnet .",
    "an important difference between this case and that of a bose gas is that the symmetry breaking term in the latter case does not commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "another proof of @xmath10 , based on ginibre s original results about the @xmath0-number substitutions , was given by st in @xcite .",
    "a rather different approach , with focus on operator algebraic aspects and correlation inequalities , can be found in a 1982 paper by fannes , pul and verbeure @xcite , see also a recent generalization to nonhomogeneous systems by pul , verbeure and zagrebnov @xcite . in these papers",
    "the equilibrium states on the weyl algebra for the infinite system and their decomposition into symmetry breaking states are studied .",
    "some technical assumptions about these states are required in @xcite and @xcite but in remark 2.1 in @xcite it is claimed that the conclusions are valid under weaker assumptions .",
    "the algebraic approach sheds a different light on the problem and is complementary to our method where essentially the only prerequisites are the existence of the thermodynamic limit of the grand canonical pressure and average density .",
    "finally we remark that the berezin - lieb inequality used in our approach gives explicit error bounds that allow us to go beyond @xcite and make @xmath0-number substitutions for _ many _ @xmath11-modes at once , provided the number of modes is lower order than the particle number .",
    "this method , that was used in a different context in @xcite , has recently proved to be a powerful tool for solving other problems about the bose gas @xcite .",
    "the concept of _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ means quite generally that a symmetry of the hamiltonian or lagrangian of a system is not present in the state under consideration ( usually a ground state or a thermal equilibrium state ) .",
    "a heisenberg ferromagnet with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath12 provides a well known example to illustrate this phenomenon . here",
    "@xmath13 is a lattice cube of finite size @xmath14 and periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the spin operators @xmath15 with @xmath16={\\rm i } s^{(3)}$ ] etc act on a copy of @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 ) at each lattice site and operators on different sites commute . the coefficients @xmath19 measure the interactions between different sites and @xmath20 denotes the strength of a magnetic field in the 3-direction . if @xmath21 the hamiltonian is invariant under the transformations @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian explicitly breaks this symmetry if @xmath24 .",
    "the thermal equilibrium state at temperature @xmath25 in the finite lattice is defined by @xmath26 and the magnetization , i.e. , the thermal average of the magnetic moment per spin , is @xmath27 the gibbs free energy per spin , @xmath28 is a concave function of @xmath20 with @xmath29 since @xmath25 may be regarded as fixed in the following we shall drop it in the notation , and in order to avoid irrelevant factors , choose energy units so that @xmath30 .    for a finite @xmath31 , @xmath32 is continuous in @xmath20 , and for @xmath21 we always have @xmath33 because the state is invariant under a unitarily implemented rotation that takes @xmath34 . on the other hand , the thermodynamic limit of the magnetization @xmath35 may break the symmetry for sufficiently low @xmath25 , i.e. , it is possible that @xmath36 since the hamiltonian is invariant under simultaneous flipping of the spins and @xmath20 we always have @xmath37 , so if @xmath38 the gibbs free energy in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath39 , is not differentiable at @xmath21 . as a concave function",
    "it is , however , differentiable almost everywhere .",
    "we may also consider the average of the square of the magnetic moment per spin , i.e. , @xmath40 with a corresponding thermodynamic limit @xmath41 . by the cauchy - schwarz inequality we always have @xmath42 hence , _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ in the sense that @xmath43 , implies _ off - diagonal long range order _ in the sense that @xmath44 it is important to note , however , that it is _ a priori _ not clear that this implies @xmath45 for reasons explained further below .",
    "on the other hand , a general argument due to griffiths @xcite shows that @xmath46 the argument is based on two facts .",
    "the first is the commutativity of the symmetry breaking term , @xmath47 , with the other part , @xmath48 , of the hamiltonian .",
    "this allows a simultaneous diagonalization of the two parts .",
    "the second fact is _",
    "griffith s lemma _ that we recall for completeness ( for a proof see @xcite or @xcite ) : + * griffith s lemma*@xcite _ let @xmath49 be a sequence of probability measures on @xmath50 such that @xmath51 exists for all @xmath52 in an interval around 0 .",
    "define @xmath53 then there is a @xmath54 such that , for any @xmath55 , @xmath56 . _",
    "+ in other words : the scaled measure , @xmath57 , is supported in @xmath58 , with exponential accuracy , as @xmath59 .    to apply this lemma to the situation under consideration we take @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath63 the probability distribution at @xmath21 for the magnetic moment per spin , @xmath64 . then @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , @xmath66 is a convex function of @xmath20 so the derivative with respect to @xmath20 is monotonously increasing .",
    "we can now conclude two things : 1 ) at points where @xmath66 is differentiable , i.e. , for almost all @xmath24 , the probability distribution of the magnetization is a delta function concentrated at @xmath67 and hence @xmath68 .",
    "2 ) the probability distribution for the magnetization at @xmath21 in the thermodynamic limit is concentrated in the interval @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "since by convexity of @xmath66 we have @xmath70 for all @xmath71 , the statements 1 ) and 2 ) together imply @xmath72 for @xmath71 . altogether eq .",
    "( [ grmagn ] ) is thus established .",
    "it is also clear that unless the probability distribution is concentrated at the end points of the interval @xmath69 $ ] the inequality @xmath72 is strict .",
    "this is exactly what happens for the heisenberg ferromagnet because as remarked in @xcite the probability distribution is a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath73 .",
    "we start with the well - known hamiltonian for bosons in a large box of volume @xmath74 , expressed in terms of the second - quantized creation and annihilation operators @xmath75 satisfying the canonical commutation relations , @xmath76 ( with @xmath77 ) . here , @xmath78 is the fourier transform of the two - body potential @xmath79 .",
    "we assume that there is a bound on the fourier coefficients @xmath80 .",
    "the case of hard core potentials can be taken care of by cutting off the potential at some finite value that is taken to infinity at the end of the calculations .",
    "we shall work in the grand canonical ensemble and hence define @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a chemical potential and @xmath83 the number operator that generates the gauge symmetry .",
    "we also add a gauge symmetry breaking term and define @xmath84 with a complex parameter @xmath85 that we can take to be a real number without loss of generality . while @xmath86 commutes with @xmath87",
    "this is no longer the case for @xmath88 if @xmath89 .",
    "we now come to the @xmath0-number substitution for @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath90 be a complex number , @xmath91 the coherent state vector in the @xmath2 fock space and let @xmath92 be the projector onto this vector .",
    "there are six relevant operators containing @xmath2 in @xmath88 , which have the following expectation values @xcite ( called _ lower symbols _ ) @xmath93 each also has an _ upper symbol _",

    "these symbols are @xmath99 we denote by @xmath100 and @xmath101 the operators obtained from @xmath88 by replacing the polynomials in @xmath2 und @xmath6 by their lower and upper symbols respectively .",
    "these operators act on the fock - space of all the modes other than the @xmath2 mode .",

    "the functions @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the corresponding finite volume pressures and we shall soon see that in the thermodynamic limit they all coincide .",
    "this follows from the inequalities @xmath110 which we now prove .",
    "the first step is @xmath111 which is a consequence of the following two facts : the completeness property of coherent states , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 where @xmath114 is any normalized vector in @xmath106 .",
    "this is jensen s inequality for the expectation value of a convex function ( like the exponential function ) of an operator . to prove ( [ clowerbound ] )",
    "we take @xmath114 in ( [ jensen ] ) to be one of the normalized eigenvectors of @xmath115 , in which case @xmath116 .",
    "we then sum over all such eigenvectors ( for a fixed @xmath90 ) and integrate over @xmath90 .",
    "the left side is then @xmath117 , while the right side is @xmath118 .",

    "their difference , in fact , is at most @xmath155 .",
    "this is the result obtained by ginibre in @xcite by more complicated arguments , under the assumption of super - stability of the interaction , and without the explicit error estimates obtained here .",
    "to summarize the situation so far , we have four expressions for the grand - canonical pressure and they are all equal in the thermodynamic limit @xmath156 when @xmath157 is not a point at which the density can be infinite .",
    "+ the expectation values @xmath158 and @xmath159 are obtained by integrating @xmath160 and @xmath90 , respectively , with the weight @xmath161 , given by @xmath162 we will show that for almost every @xmath85 , the density @xmath163 converges in the thermodynamic limit to a @xmath164-function at the point @xmath165 , where @xmath166 maximizes the partition function @xmath167 .",
    "that is , @xmath168 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this holds for those @xmath85 where the pressure in the thermodynamic limit is differentiable ; since @xmath107 is convex ( upwards ) in @xmath85 this is true almost everywhere .",

    "@xmath172 is not of this product form .",
    "however , the weight for @xmath141 , which is @xmath173 does have the right form . in the following we shall show that the two weights are equal apart from negligible errors . equality ( [ equality ] ) holds also for all @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath174 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact , since the upper and lower symbols agree for @xmath2 and @xmath6 , the error estimates above remain unchanged .",

    "( the original griffiths argument can easily be extended to two variables , as we have here .",
    "because of radial symmetry , the derivative of the pressure with respect to @xmath181 is zero at any non - zero real @xmath85 . )",
    "moreover , by comparing the derivatives of @xmath182 and @xmath153 we see that @xmath183 , since @xmath184 is contained in the interval between the left and right derivatives of @xmath185 with respect to @xmath85 .    we shall now show that the same is true for @xmath172 . to this end",
    ", we add another term to the hamiltonian , namely @xmath186 , with @xmath187 and @xmath66 real . if @xmath188 is a nice function of two real variables with bounded second derivatives , it is then easy to see that the upper and lower symbols of @xmath95 differ only by a term of order @xmath189 .",
    "namely , for some @xmath190 independent of @xmath191 and @xmath74 , @xmath192 hence , in particular , @xmath193 in the tl . moreover , if @xmath194 for @xmath195 , then the pressure is independent of @xmath187 for @xmath196 small enough ( depending only on @xmath164 ) .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "we have @xmath197 where the last expectation is in the @xmath198 ensemble at @xmath199 .",
    "the corresponding distribution is exponentially localized at @xmath200 by griffiths lemma , and therefore the right side of ( [ c21 ] ) goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit for small enough @xmath187 . in particular , the @xmath187-derivative of the thermodynamic limit pressure at @xmath199 is zero . by convexity in @xmath187",
    ", this implies that the derivative of @xmath154 at finite volume , given by @xmath201 , goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since @xmath66 was arbitrary , @xmath202 as @xmath203 .",
    "this holds for all @xmath176 , and therefore proves the statement .",
    "our method also applies to the case when the pressure is not differentiable in @xmath85 ( which is the case at @xmath177 in the presence of bec ) . in this case , the resulting weights @xmath172 and @xmath204 need not be @xmath164-functions , but as in the argument for ( [ grmagn ] ) in the previous section griffiths method implies that they are , for @xmath89 , supported on the real axis between the right and left derivative of @xmath154 and , for @xmath177 , on a disc ( due to the gauge symmetry ) with radius determined by the right derivative at @xmath177 .",
    "convexity of the pressure as a function of @xmath85 thus implies that in the thermodynamic limit the supports of the weights @xmath172 and @xmath204 for @xmath89 lie outside of this disc .",
    "hence @xmath205 is monotone increasing in @xmath85 in the thermodynamic limit . in combination with ( [ 19 ] )",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath206 hence ( [ mainstatement ] ) is established .",
    "we note that by eq .",

    "note , however , that a non - vanishing of the right side of ( [ roep ] ) does not _ a priori _ imply a non - vanishing of the left side .",
    "i.e. , it is _ a priori _ possible that bec only shows up after introducing an explicit gauge - breaking term to the hamiltonian . while it is expected on physical grounds that positivity of the right side of ( [ roep ] ) implies positivity of the left side , a rigorous proof is lacking , so far . in the example of the heisenberg magnet discussed in the previous section , equality in ( [ roep ] )",
    "does not generally hold , but still both sides are non - vanishing in the same parameter regime .",
    "to illustrate what could arise mathematically , in principle , consider a weight function of the form @xmath207 this distribution converges for @xmath203 to a @xmath164-function at @xmath208 , and consequently there is no bec at @xmath177 . on the other hand ,",
