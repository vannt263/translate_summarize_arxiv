    "carbon dioxide ( co@xmath8 ) is an abundant and important constituent in planetary atmospheres as well as cometary comae , and is considered to be a key species which links between interstellar chemistry and planetary chemistry . so far solid co@xmath8 was found ubiquitously toward intermediate- to high mass star - forming regions through observations of its vibrational bands with infrared space observatory ( iso ) and spitzer space telescope ( e.g. de graauw et al .",
    "1996 ; grakines et al . 1999 ; nummelin et al . 2001 ; sonnentrucker et al .",
    "a typical abundance of solid co@xmath8 relative to h@xmath8 is as high as 10@xmath12 to 10@xmath13 ( gerakines et al .",
    "furthermore , dartoris et al .",
    "( 2005 ) discovered huge amount of solid co@xmath8 even toward the low - mass class 0 protostar , l723 , by observations with spitzer space telescope .",
    "gaseous co@xmath8 was also detected in hot regions around several massive young stellar objects , where a typical abundance relative to h@xmath8 was reported to be an order of 10@xmath14 ( e.g. van dishoeck et al .",
    "1996 ; boonman et al .",
    "2003b ; sonnentrucker et al .",
    "these observations clearly indicate that co@xmath8 is a major chemical component in molecular clouds .",
    "however , the formation processes of co@xmath8 are not well understood .",
    "in particular , a contribution of the gas phase production of co@xmath8 is quite uncertain .",
    "although the gas - phase chemical models predict the co@xmath8 abundance relative to h@xmath8 of about 10@xmath14 ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "1997 ) , this has not been confirmed observationally in cold molecular clouds and low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "a difficulty in measuring the abundances of gaseous co@xmath8 in these regions comes from a lack of a permanent dipole moment of co@xmath8 .",
    "because of this , radio observations of the rotational emission lines are impossible .",
    "infrared observations of its vibration - rotation transitions would also be difficult because of insufficient brightness of background infrared sources or even of a lack of the sources .",
    "an alternative way is to observe the rotational emission lines of protonated carbon dioxide , hco@xmath2 , in the millimeter - wave region , because its abundance is directly related to the abundance of co@xmath8 .",
    "however , hco@xmath2 has never been detected in any cold molecular clouds and any star - forming regions except for the galactic center clouds like sgr b2 and sgr a ( thaddeus et al . 1981 ; defrees et al . 1982 ; minh et al . 1991 ) .",
    "it has been thought that hco@xmath2 is produced only under a specific condition in the galactic center region , where shock chemistry would play an important role ( e.g. minh et al .",
    "1988 ; charnley et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "an important breakthrough to this situation came from our preliminary line survey toward a low - mass protostar iras 04368 + 2557 in l1527 with the nobeyama 45 m radio telescope ( nro 45 m ) , by which peculiar carbon - chain chemistry in this source ( sakai et al .",
    "2007 , 2008a , 2008b ) was being explored . with a very sensitive observation , we recently found a weak emission line at the frequency of the @xmath0 line of hco@xmath2 .",
    "iras 04368 + 2557 is a low - mass protostar in a transient phase from class 0 to class i , which has extensively been studied by many researchers ( e.g. ohashi et al .",
    "1997 ; hogerheijde et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) . hence",
    ", this discovery , if confirmed , is very important for understanding of the behavior of co@xmath8 during chemical evolution from molecular clouds to protoplanetary disks .",
    "then we carried out more sensitive observations with the iram 30 m telescope ( iram 30 m ) and firmly confirmed our detection of hco@xmath2 . in this letter , we report the first detection of hco@xmath2 in the star - forming region , l1527 , and discuss its astrochemical implication .",
    "observations of the hco@xmath2 lines toward iras 04368@xmath42557 in l1527 were carried out with nro 45 m and iram 30 m in 2007 .",
    "we observed the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 lines , whose frequencies are listed in table 1 .",
    "the observed position was @xmath15 .    in the observation with nro 45 m , we used two sis mixer receivers ( s80 and s100 ) simultaneously ,",
    "whose typical system temperature was about 300 k. the main beam efficiency and the beam size of the telescope are 0.51 and 20@xmath5 , respectively , at 85.5 ghz .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked by observing the nearby sio maser source ( nml tau ) every hour .",
    "the pointing accuracy was better than 8@xmath5 .",
    "the position - switching mode was employed for the observations , where the off position was taken at @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the backend was an acousto - optical radiospectrometer ( aos - w ) , whose bandwidth is 250 mhz .",
    "the velocity resolution is 0.87 km s@xmath18 at 85.5 ghz .",
    "the intensity scale was calibrated by the chopper wheel method .    in iram",
    "30 m observations , the 3 mm sis receivers ( a100 and b100 ) were used as front ends , whose system noise temperatures ranged from 75 k to 105 k for a100 and from 90 k to 130 k for b100 . the beam size and the main beam efficiency",
    "are 29@xmath5 and 0.78 , respectively , at 85.5 ghz .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every hour by observing nearby continuum sources , and was maintained to be better than 4@xmath5 .",
    "the backend was an autocorrelator , vespa .",
    "we set the bandwidth and resolution of the individual window to be 20 mhz and 20 khz , respectively .",
    "the frequency resolution corresponds to the velocity resolution of 0.07 km s@xmath18 at 85.5 ghz .",
    "the observation was made in the frequency switching mode with a frequency offset of 2 mhz .",
    "the @xmath0 line of hco@xmath2 was first recognized toward l1527 during our preliminary line survey with nro 45 m. although the line width is slightly broad due to the insufficient velocity resolution , the line was detected with the 5.0 @xmath19 confidence level in integrated intensity ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , it was still necessary to confirm this detection by observing multiple rotational transitions .",
    "then , we made further observations with iram 30 m. as a result , we successfully detected the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio of the @xmath1 line is not very good , it was detected with 4.7 @xmath19 confidence level in integrated intensity .",
    "the line parameters derived from gaussian fitting are summarized in table 1 , and the line profiles are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the @xmath20 values are consistent with those of other molecules in this region ( e.g. sakai et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) , no significant velocity shift being observed .",
    "the line widths are slightly narrower than those of the other molecules ( @xmath21 0.5 km s@xmath18 ) . because of the narrow line width and sparse spectral density , accidental matching of other lines is unlikely ( cf .",
    "sakai et al .",
    "2008b ) .",
    "the beam averaged column density of hco@xmath2 is determined from the observed intensities by the least - squares method .",
    "we assume the lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) condition and take the effect of the optical depth into account .",
    "details of the procedure are described elsewhere ( sakai et al .",
    "the lte assumption is justified because the density of the l1527 core ( @xmath2210@xmath23 @xmath24 for @xmath25 scale ) ( sakai et al .",
    "2008a ) is higher than the critical density of the observed hco@xmath2 transitions ( @xmath26 @xmath24 ) , where the collisional cross sections are taken from hammami et al .",
    "since the upper state energies of the two observed transitions are not very different from each other , it is difficult to determine the rotational temperature of hco@xmath2 significantly .",
    "therefore , we assume the rotational temperature of 12.3 k , which is the typical value in l1527 ( e.g. sakai et al .",
    "the column density of hco@xmath2 is determined to be @xmath6 @xmath7 , where we employ the dipole moment along the a - axis of 2.85 d calculated by the b3lyp/6 - 311g(d , p ) method ( y. osamura , 2008 , private communication ) .",
    "even when the assumed excitation temperature is changed to 30 k , the derived column density increases only by a factor of 1.8 .",
    "the optical depth is 0.006 and 0.005 for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines , respectively , if the beam dilution effect is not taken into account .",
    "the source size of hco@xmath2 is unknown , but we could put a constraint on it from our observations .",
    "the integrated intensity ( @xmath27 ) of the @xmath0 line observed with nro 45 m seems to be higher than that observed with iram 30 m in spite of a large uncertainty of the nro 45 m data ( table 1 ) .",
    "this implies that the hco@xmath2 distribution is at least smaller than the beam size of iram 30 m ( 29@xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore the peak column density of hco@xmath2 would be higher than the beam averaged value obtained above .",
    "the present result shows the existence of hco@xmath2 in the low - mass star - forming core . the column density of hco@xmath2 in l1527 is less than those toward sgr b2 and sgr a ( e.g. minh et al .",
    "1988 ; deguchi et al .",
    "2006 ) by almost three orders of magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the hco@xmath2 lines were not detected in other regions including star - forming cores such as orion kl and b335 in spite of extensive searches ( minh et al .",
    "one possible explanation of the none - detection would be insufficient sensitivity of the previous observations .",
    "in fact , the column density of hco@xmath2 in l1527 is lower than the upper limits reported by minh et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ( @xmath28 @xmath7 )",
    "in this section , we derive the fractional abundance of the gaseous co@xmath8 with an aid of a simplified chemical model . the abundance of hco@xmath2 is related to that of co@xmath8 through the following reactions ; @xmath29 @xmath30 where h@xmath31 is formed by the cosmic - ray ionization of h@xmath8 and subsequent reaction of h@xmath2 + h@xmath8 , and is destructed by @xmath32 the electron recombination is less important as destruction processes of hco@xmath2 and h@xmath31 , and is ignored . when we assume the steady - state condition , ratio of the number density , @xmath33(hco@xmath2)/@xmath33(co@xmath8 ) , can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 represent the rate coefficients for reactions ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) , respectively , and @xmath38 represents the cosmic ray ionization rate , @xmath39 s@xmath18 ( e.g. aikawa et al . 2008 ) . here the unit of @xmath33(x ) is @xmath24 , and the fractional abundance of co relative to h@xmath8 is denoted as @xmath40 .",
    "we employ the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 values of @xmath41 @xmath42 s@xmath18 ( burt et al .",
    "1970 ) , @xmath43 @xmath42 s@xmath18 ( umist data base ) , and @xmath44 @xmath42 s@xmath18 ( kim et al .",
    "1975 ) , respectively .",
    "the numerical factor in equation ( 4 ) could be larger or smaller by a factor of 3 .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath33(hco@xmath2)/@xmath33(co@xmath8 ) ratio is inversely proportional to the h@xmath8 density , as far as @xmath40 is constant . in other words ,",
    "the fractional abundance of co@xmath8 relative to h@xmath8 ( @xmath45 ) is simply proportional to @xmath33(hco@xmath2 ) ; @xmath46 if co@xmath8 exists only within the sphere with a radius of @xmath47 around the protostar , with the constant @xmath45 , @xmath33(hco@xmath2 ) is also constant and is related to the beam averaged column density @xmath48(hco@xmath2 ) as @xmath49 assuming the gaussian - shaped telescope beam with an e - fold beam radius of @xmath50 .",
    "note that the right - hand side of equation ( 6 ) approaches to @xmath51(hco@xmath2 ) for @xmath52 and to @xmath33(hco@xmath2)@xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "with equation ( 6 ) , we can derive @xmath45 directly from the observed @xmath48(hco@xmath2 ) without any assumptions on the h@xmath8 density and the h@xmath8 column density .",
    "we calculate @xmath45 as a function of @xmath47 , as shown in figure 2 , where we employ the @xmath40 value of @xmath55 reported by j@xmath56rgensen et al .",
    "the half - power beam radius ( @xmath57 ) for iram 30 m is 2000 au , where the distance to l1527 is assumed to be 140 pc .    according to maret et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the size of the hot region where co@xmath8 can be evaporated ( 50 k ) is estimated to be smaller than 140 au for l1527 . if gaseous co@xmath8 traced by our hco@xmath2 observation are confined to this small radius , @xmath45 should be evaluated to be higher than @xmath10 by using figure 2 . in the ice evaporation region(100 k ) ,",
    "h@xmath8o and nh@xmath58 would become very abundant and contribute to further destruction of hco@xmath2 in the innermost region .",
    "this effect can be involved as an effectively larger @xmath40 value in equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "then @xmath45 is comparable to the elemental abundance of carbon in interstellar clouds ( @xmath59 ) . on the other hand , furlan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) recently reported the mass fractional abundance of solid co@xmath8 relative to the gas in l1527 to be @xmath60 with the spitzer observation , which corresponds to the fractional abundance of solid co@xmath8 relative to h@xmath8 of @xmath61 .",
    "this is much lower than the @xmath45 value derived from our observation .",
    "hence , the direct evaporation of co@xmath8 is very unrealistic as a major source of gaseous co@xmath8 traced by hco@xmath2 in l1527 .",
    "this would further be supported by the narrow line width ( 0.57 km s@xmath18 ) of hco@xmath2 in comparison with the line width of the very high excitation line of hc@xmath62n ( @xmath63 , 85.2 ghz , @xmath64=67 k ) observed with iram 30 m in l1527 ( sakai et al . in preparation ) .    if we assume @xmath45 of @xmath65 , which is close to the value reported in orion - kl irc2 by the infrared observation ( boonman et al .",
    "2003a ) , @xmath47 is derived to be 1600 au . on the other hand , @xmath45 is still as high as @xmath11 , even if hco@xmath2 is extended over the beam size of iram 30 m. therefore , substantial amount of co@xmath8 exists even in the low temperature region where thermal evaporation of co@xmath8 from grain mantles is very inefficient . it should be noted that the interaction between outflows and ambient gas would not be responsible for the co@xmath8 production in l1527 , because the line width of hco@xmath2 is narrow and no velocity shift is observed .",
    "as described above , most of gaseous co@xmath8 in l1527 does not originate from direct evaporation of solid co@xmath8 , but from gas - phase reactions .",
    "since the gas phase production of co@xmath8 is not well understood observationally ( e.g. van dishoeck et al . 2004 ) , we discuss a few possibilities .",
    "first we compare our result with the chemical model calculation by lee et al .",
    "according to their new standard model , the gas phase abundance of co@xmath8 is expected to be @xmath66 and @xmath67 at @xmath68 yr and the steady state , respectively , for the h@xmath8 density of 10@xmath69 @xmath24 .",
    "this is almost consistent with our result in l1527 , if the co@xmath8 distribution is extended over the beam size of iram 30 m.    secondly , co@xmath8 might be produced in a hot region through a reaction of oh and co. since this reaction has activation barrier of 176 k ( umist data base ; see also talbi and herbst 2002 for the potential energy surface . ) , it is efficient in a small region near the protostar , like a hot core or a hot corino . in such a hot region ,",
    "the abundance of h@xmath8co is enhanced due to mantle evaporation , which would supply hco through the electron recombination reaction of h@xmath8coh@xmath3 formed from h@xmath8co and h@xmath31 .",
    "then , co@xmath8 will be produced through the hco @xmath4 o reaction ( e.g. snyder et al .",
    "however , these high temperature mechanisms occur in a much smaller region than the co@xmath8 evaporation region , and hence , they can not be major contributors .",
    "since l1527 shows warm carbon - chain chemistry ( wccc ) ( sakai et al .",
    "2008a ) , we finally consider a possible co@xmath8 formation related to the wccc . in the wccc",
    ", ch@xmath70 evaporated from grain mantles drives the carbon - chain chemistry . at the same time",
    ", hco would be produced by various reactions , which successively forms co@xmath8 by the reaction with the atomic oxygen .",
    "the warm region , where ch@xmath70 can be evaporated , is substantially larger than the region where co@xmath8 can be evaporated , and hence , co@xmath8 would be distributed over the size of wccc ( sakai et al .",
    "rather compact distribution of hco@xmath2 inferred from the beam dilution effect , if correct , favors this scenario rather than the production of co@xmath8 in a cold cloud . in this relation , the hco ( @xmath71",
    ", 86.7 ghz ) line is detected toward l1527 in our preliminary line survey , which may also support the above idea .",
    "furthermore , an enhancement of gaseous co@xmath8 in the warm region , where ch@xmath70 is evaporated , is predicted in a chemical model of a dynamically evolving cloud by aikawa et al .",
    "( 2008 , figs . 6 and 10 ) . in order to establish the formation pathway of co@xmath8 , distribution of hco@xmath2 in l1527 is a key .",
    "a high spatial resolution observation with an interferometer would be necessary . by comparing the result with the detailed chemical model calculations",
    ", we will be able to investigate the contributions of cold gas phase chemistry and wccc to the formation of co@xmath8 .",
    "sensitive observations of hco@xmath2 toward various clouds would also be needed to understand the origin of gaseous co@xmath8 .",
