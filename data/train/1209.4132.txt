    "a vast majority of bacteria and archaea can grow in diverse environmental conditions .",
    "the range of those conditions include high pressures  @xcite , high temperature  @xcite , low temperature  @xcite , high salinity , low  @xcite and high ph  @xcite etc .",
    "since these conditions are not hospitable for other life forms hence these organisms are named extremophiles  @xcite .",
    "one of the first isolated extremophile _ thermus aquaticus _",
    ", a thermophilic bacteria can survive at near - boiling temperatures  @xcite .",
    "adaptation of these organisms to such harsh conditions raises many interesting questions  how do they adapt to these conditions ? does the adaptation occur at single component level such as mutations in proteins leading to their barostability and thermostability , or the adaptation to these conditions has a collective nature whereas more than one cellular components act in compliance to preserve the functionality of each other .",
    "recent studies on various aspects - such as taxonomy , ecology , enzymology of these microorganisms have provided insights on the adaptation of these organism to their environmental conditions  @xcite .",
    "for example , the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane must maintain its liquid - crystalline structure and semipermeability with changing conditions  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that bacterial membrane adapt to the temperature changes by changing their lipid composition  @xcite .",
    "adaptation of a protein to non - ambient conditions requires that it maintains its catalytic activity as well as its structure  @xcite .",
    "most globular proteins denature both at high as well as low temperatures .",
    "moreover , even if a protein does not denature at low temperature , small thermal fluctuations will lead to decreased catalytic activity at low temperatures .",
    "indeed in few studies on proteins from psychrophilic organisms , it was found that proteins are more flexible  @xcite .",
    "however , increase of flexibility also leads to high propensity of unfolding of the protein .",
    "hence a fine balance between the structural flexibility and stability is required  @xcite .",
    "recent comparative study of an essential recombination protein reca from mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria suggests that its function of binding to single stranded dna is adapted to the conditions in which organisms grow  @xcite .",
    "a study of ssb , a single - stranded dna binding protein , from mesophilic and piezophilic bacteria show similar adaptation  @xcite .    while there is a large body of work on the stability and kinetics of proteins and adaptation of different components of prokaryotes obtained from extremophiles , the growth of bacteria",
    "is only approached using conventional methods such as plate counting .",
    "such studies have provided killing curves of saturated bacterial solutions upon increasing pressures and hence a pressure - temperature phase diagram of the bacterial survival is obtained  @xcite .    in order to understand the adaptation of bacterial cells to extreme pressure and temperature ,",
    "an understanding of growth bottlenecks and physical changes of bacterial growing at ambient conditions induced by different thermodynamic conditions is important . in this paper",
    ", we study the pressure - temperature dependence of growth and phenotypic changes of a mesophilic bacterium , _",
    "e. coli _ , using an optical method which allows us to measure the growth of bacterial in real time at different pressures and temperatures .",
    "we have investigated the growth and morphological changes in a wide range of pressure and temperature . in `` methods '' ,",
    "we describe our experimental setup and protocol to measure growth of bacteria . in `` results '' ,",
    "we summarize the results of the pressure - temperature dependence of growth followed by a stochastic model to account for the morphological changes induced by high pressure .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in `` summary and discussions '' .",
    "measurement of growth at normal conditions is rather easy as there are many commercial photometers available .",
    "high pressure and temperature require that a photometer optics is built around a high pressure cell in order to obtain the growth curve .",
    "below we describe our experimental setup to measure the growth .",
    "bacteria absorb and scatter light with intensity which depends on the scattering angle and absorption coefficient  @xcite .",
    "the most common method of measuring bacterial concentration in a solution is turbidity method where the extinction of the light is measured at a fixed angle , usually in forward direction .",
    "the method relies on many assumptions including ( i ) each bacterial cell is an independent scatterer ( ii ) the shape of bacterial cell is uniform ( iii ) multiple scattering is negligible .",
    "the extinction cross section @xmath7 is a sum of cross section due to scattering @xmath8 and due to absorption @xmath9 , and can be written as @xmath10 then the coefficient of extinction @xmath11 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number density of bacterial cells . the intensity @xmath14 detected by a light detector after the incident light traverses a distance @xmath15 in the scattering medium is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the intensity of the light incident on the medium .",
    "hence the difference of the logarithm of the intensities of incident and the transmitted light is proportional to the concentration of scatterers in the medium . the optical density ( od ) of the medium",
    "is thus defined as @xmath18 a schematic of our experimental setup to measure pressure temperature dependence of growth is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "a sample of bacteria with lb medium is contained in a rectangular cuvette ( spectrocell ; volume : 400@xmath19 ) made up of fused silica and having a square cross - section ( 6mmx6 mm ) .",
    "the cuvette with a flexible movable teflon cap is loaded into the high pressure cell ( iss , illinois , usa ) .",
    "a piston is used to pressurize the water inside the pressure cell , and the pressure is measured by a pressure gauge .",
    "the growth of the bacteria is measured in real time by shining a white light ( xenon lamp ) which passes through an excitation bandpass filter ( semrock , ff01 - 586/15 - 25 ) and is focused onto the cuvette holding the sample .",
    "we chose light with @xmath20  nm wavelength to keep our measurements consistent with measurements done with most of the commercially available photometers .",
    "the transmitted light is focused on a light detector on the other side of the cuvette which measures the intensity of the transmitted light .",
    "the light detector is built around photo sensor chip tsl230r ( taos ) .",
    "tsl230r photo sensor consists of a silicon photodiode with a current to frequency converter built into it .",
    "the nonlinearity error is typically 0.2% at 100khz .",
    "the frequency of the ttl signal from the detector proportional to the incident light intensity is measured using mio16 frequency counter chip interfaced to labview software ( national instruments ) .",
    "we maintain the intensity of the light source such that all our experiments fall into the linear regime of the sensor .",
    "the distance between the light sensor and the cuvette was @xmath21  cm .",
    "distance between the detector and the sample dictatates the angular integration of the scattered light incident on the sensor .",
    "the temperature of the high pressure cell is regulated using a circular water bath thermostat .",
    "the time for growth measurement ranged between @xmath22 and @xmath23  mins , depending on the pressure - temperature dependent growth rate of bacteria .",
    "the entirely closed structure of our experimental setup imposes a major limitation on the regulation of oxygen in our experiments .",
    "the growth measurements were done in oxygen limited conditions .",
    "the partial pressure of oxygen in lb medium was @xmath24kpa .",
    "for all the experiments reported here , dh@xmath25 strain of _",
    "e. coli _ was used .",
    "while other wild type strains of e. coli such as mg1655 ( k-12 ) or mc1000 are common for studying the physiology of bacterial cells due to least amount of genetic mutations , dh5@xmath11 offers certain advantages for our studies .",
    "earlier studies have shown that a major effect of the pressure on the morphology is elongation of cells .",
    "due to cell elongation , sos system is implicated in the change of morphology at high pressures .",
    "the reca1 mutation in dh5@xmath11 causes the elimination of the homologous recombination , an initiatiator process for sos pathway upon uv irradiation  @xcite .",
    "lack of reca mediated recombination in dh@xmath11 removes the effect of pressure on the sos pathway .",
    "hence our experimental results would be able to distinguish the high pressure effects where recombination system is not involved ( discussed in the summary and dicussion section ) .",
    "the drawback of using dh@xmath25 is that since it lacks the homologous recombination system , the cell are sickly and the growth is slower compared to other wild type strains . due to its slow growth ,",
    "cells were grown in standard luria broth ( lb ) medium  @xcite , which is a rich medium for bacterial growth .",
    "the ph of the growth medium was kept to @xmath26 by adding naoh to the solution . for the consistency of the experiments ,",
    "cells were first grown on a lb plate for about 10 hours and then subsequently used for experiments as described below .    * _ growth conditions and measurements .",
    "_ * bacterial cells picked from lb plate were first grown in lb medium at atmospheric pressure and @xmath27c in an incubator until the optical density ( od ) of the solution is about @xmath28 .",
    "a small amount of freshly grown bacterial cells was then added to a cuvette containing @xmath29  l of medium to bring the initial od to @xmath30 and was used as the starting point for all the pressure temperature measurements . the final bacterial solution with lb medium",
    "was then transfered to a high pressure cuvette at room temperature and pressure and was closed with a teflon cap .",
    "the cuvette with the bacterial solution was then put into the high pressure chamber ( see the experimental setup ) equilibrated at the temperature of interest and the piston of the high pressure setup was slowly increased until the pressure gauge reading reaches the desired value of the pressure .",
    "the growth of the bacterial cells then was assessed by measuring extinction of light as described in our experimental setup .",
    "growth measurements were done in a sealed high pressure cell .",
    "images were taken using sensicam cooled ccd camera connected to zeiss axiovert 35 microscope with a 40x olympus objective .",
    "image analysis of bacterial cells was done using imagej software  @xcite .",

    "we find that the low pressure regime of increase of division time with pressure can be fit by an exponential function where the exponent increases with decreasing temperature . the discontinuous change in @xmath41 coincides with departure from exponential behavior .",
    "pressure and temperature do not only affect the structural stability of biomolecules but can also affect the thermodynamic force driving different biochemical processes inside the cell .",
    "in general , the time scale of a given chemical reaction is proportional to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath47 is the volume change across the chemical reaction .",
    "it is easy to see that any chemical reaction accompanied by a positive volume change will exponentially slowdown with pressure . in this context ,",
    "the exponential dependence of @xmath41 with pressure  ( fig.[fig : fig4 ] ) is not a surprise .",
    "note that it is a very simple consideration as most of the biochemical processes are not invidividual but usually involve a cascade of chemical reacations corresponding to any cellular module .",
    "nonetheless , the exponential dependence of the division time with pressure does suggest an overall positive volume change .",
    "furthermore , @xmath47 itself is a function of pressure and temperature . at moderate pressures and temperature",
    "one may assume it to be a constant .",
    "it is hard to speculate the mechanisms responsible for slow growth and further experiments must be carried out to precisely figure out the decrease of growth rate at high pressure .",
    "the other remarkable feature of the pressure dependence of division time is the abrupt increase of @xmath41 in the range of pressures 200 - 400  atm for all the temperatures studied here .",
    "where does this discontinuity in the pressure dependence of growth come from ?",
    "discontinuity in the growth as a function of pressure suggest that something abrupt must happen in these range of pressure .",
    "the range of pressures where we see a discontinous jump in the division time can not be attributed to protein denaturation as the pressure is not high enough to denature the proteins .",
    "while the proteins stability is rather unaffected , the functionality of proteins may show a large variability in this range of pressures  @xcite .",
    "we hypothesize that the discontinuous jump in the division time stem from functional changes in biomolecules .     for two different temperatures @xmath33  c and @xmath27  c on a linear - log plot .",
    "the low pressure linear depedence on a linear - log plot suggests that @xmath41 follows an exponential behavior .",

    "smooth change as a function of pressure and temperature but high pressures as well as low temperatures growth are marked by sharp change in @xmath38 .",
    "we further find that the slope of the locus of the points in the ( p , t ) plane where @xmath48 shows sharp transition with respect to pressure resembles the functional phase diagram of a typical protein ( shown as dotted white curve in fig .",

    "besides the slow growth of the population of bacterial cells at high pressures , the other interesting features of the response to high pressure is found in the morphological changes in bacterial cells  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) . while the bacterial cell elongation at high pressure is known , the sharp transition at high pressure is new . furthermore , we find that the pressure and temperature where the growth is marked by a sharp increase in division time correlates well with sharp changes in bacterial cell length . the exponential increase of division time with pressure as we saw in the earlier section can be interpreted as exponential decrease of overall kinetics leading to slow growth due to cell elongation at high pressure . while the increased cell length upon increasing pressure would explain the decreased rate of growth , it is not clear if the elongated cells would grow slower than the cells with normal morphology .",
    "for example , if the elongated cells just lack the ability of cell division but replicate their genome normally then one would expect the growth rate per unit cell size not to change unless other kinetic processes also get affected by the increase of pressure .     as a function of pressure at @xmath33  c.",

    "a quick overview of figs .  [ fig : fig6 ] and  [ fig : fig7 ] suggests that while the average length of the bacterial cells undergoes a sharp transition at high pressures , a major fraction of bacterial still retain the morphology of a normal cell .     or switch to a filamenting phenotype with a probability @xmath62 .",
    "once a bacterial cell s fate changes to filamentation , it just grows without dividing.,width=302,height=151 ]    the change of morphology can be thought of as an irreversible switch of bacterial morphology during the course of growth of the bacterial cell where the rate of switching will depend on the pressure .",
    "let us assume that we start with @xmath63 cells at time @xmath64 .",
    "let s further assume that the cells either decide to divide into two identical cells with probability @xmath11 or grow irreversibly to a filamenting bacteria with probability @xmath65 .",
