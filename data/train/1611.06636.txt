    "recently , monolayer fese grown on srtio@xmath2 substrate has attracted a lot of attention for its high-@xmath3 superconductivity , which has not been found in bulk fese in spite of similar structures @xcite .",
    "some researches demonstrate that the different superconductive behaviours of monolayer fese and bulk fese are due to the influence of the srtio@xmath2 substrate and the interface between fese and srtio@xmath2 @xcite , while the mysterious antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structures of fese also paly a major role .",
    "therefore , theoretical studies on the magnetic property of fese have been intensively carried out , and a variety of afm orders , including checkerboard ( cb ) afm @xcite , collinear ( col ) afm @xcite and pair - checkerboard ( pcb ) afm orders @xcite , have been investigated .",
    "a novel nematic afm phase is also proposed theoretically @xcite . however , the magnetic measurements such as neutron scattering @xcite and superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) @xcite , can only detect the magnetic signal of bulk fese rather than the fese monolayer . in monolayer fese ,",
    "only the electronic structure can be obtained via , for example , the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the comparison between experimental and theoretical achievements are confusing . on one hand ,",
    "the band structures of cb - afm and pcb - afm ordered fese resemble the results from the arpes experiments @xcite . on the other hand , col - afm order is the ground - state afm order from first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "these controversial results suggest that the magnetic structure of monolayer fese is intriguing , and still needs to be further confirmed .    in bulk fese ,",
    "the te substitution for se atoms can enhance the critical temperature from 9 k @xcite to more than 14 k @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that the monolayer fese@xmath4te@xmath5 also has high-@xmath3 superconductivity .",
    "indeed , some experiments have demonstrated the high-@xmath3 superconductive behaviour in fese@xmath4te@xmath5 and the critical temperature is found to be dominated by grown conditions and in - plane strain @xcite .",
    "moreover , fese@xmath4te@xmath5 , as well as fese , is a topological insulator @xcite .",
    "the topological character combined with afm structures and superconductivity could give rise to a rich variety of novel physical phenomena .",
    "but a systematical analysis of the magnetic properties and band structures of fese@xmath4te@xmath5 in theory is still lacked .",
    "bearing this in mind , we aim at providing a comprehensive study on the electronic property of fese@xmath4te@xmath6 with different magnetic orders .    in this paper , we calculate the electronic band structures of monolayer fese and typical te - substituted monolayer fese@xmath0te@xmath0 with different magnetic orders using first - principles tools , and search the magnetic ground state for both monolayer fese and fese@xmath0te@xmath0 .",
    "the direction of the magnetic moments can make a big difference on the band structures due to the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "besides , since te - substitution breaks the space symmetry to some extent , the band structures of fese@xmath0te@xmath0 have a novel rashba - dresselhaus splitting .",
    "but the band gaps are either only slightly enlarged ( with pcb order ) or even much shrunk ( with col order ) in fese@xmath0te@xmath0 compared with those in fese .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we describe the calculational details and geometries of different structures .",
    "then we present our results for pristine monolayer fese , followed by our main results in fese@xmath0te@xmath0 . at last",
    ", there is a summary .",
    "we have performed spin - polarized first - principles calculations on the total energy , magnetic and electronic structures of fese and fese@xmath0te@xmath0 with the project augmented wave method @xcite as implemented in the vasp code @xcite . plane waves less than 400 ev",
    "were used to expand the wave functions . for the exchange - correlation potential ,",
    "we have adopted the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) type @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effect was included all through the calculations ; meanwhile we have also performed normal calculations without soc for comparison .",
    "since soc distinguishes the direction of the electron spins , the magnetic moments can thus rotate three - dimensionally . in view of this , both situations in which the magnetic moments are parallel to the monolayer ( in - plane ) and perpendicular to the monolayer ( out - of - plane ) were considered .",
    "the structural optimization has employed the conjugate gradient algorithm @xcite and the residual forces on all relaxed atoms were smaller than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the monolayer fese and fese@xmath0te@xmath0 were both stacked with a vacuum layer of 20   thick to eliminate the coupling between periodic monolayers . during the structural relaxation ,",
    "the lattice parameters were fixed at @xmath7 3.9015   to mimic the confinements of srtio@xmath2 substrate . in the simplest",
    "afm ordered fese , i.e. fese with the cb order , the magnetic unit cell is @xmath8 of the original non - magnetic unit cell and contains 4 atoms . for fese with col and pcb orders ,",
    "the magnetic unit cells are @xmath9 of the original unit cell containing 8 atoms and @xmath10 enlarged cell containing 16 atoms , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . accordingly , the k - grids for cb- , col- and pcb - afm phases are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in a monkhorst - pack grids , respectively . besides , a paramagnetic ( pm ) monolayer is also investigated with the same unit cell as cb ordered monolayer for reference .",
    "te@xmath0 configurations in ( a ) paramagnetic ( pm ) state and cb - afm order , ( c ) col - afm order and ( d ) pcb - afm order .",
    "the distance between the se ( te ) atom and the fe - plane is denoted as @xmath14 ( @xmath14 ) as shown in ( b ) .",
    "the te - substituted configurations in the left panel , middle panel and right panel of ( c ) , are denoted as struc.1 , struc.2 and struc.3 for the col ordered system .",
    "the same goes to ( d ) . ]    for te substitution , considering that fe ions with antiparallel magnetic moments are not equivalent , there could be more than one configurations as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "paramagnetic fese@xmath0te@xmath0 and cb - afm fese@xmath0te@xmath0 each have only one configuration , in which all se atoms are on top of the fe - layer and all te atoms are below the fe - layer , or the other way around , as shown in fig .",
    "for fese@xmath0te@xmath0 with col and pcb orders , besides the configuration mentioned above as shown in the leftmost panel of fig .",
    "2(c , d ) , te atoms can both take the top - layer and bottom - layer positions simultaneously .",
    "since fe ions with magnetic moments in different directions are not equivalent , the substituted te atoms can align along @xmath15-axis or @xmath16-axis .",
    "therefore , with col order or pcb order , there are 3 types of te - substituted fese@xmath0te@xmath0 configurations which for the later convenience are denoted as struc.1 , struc.2 and struc.3 .",
    "for the monolayer fese , the lattice constant is fixed at the calculated lattice parameter of srtio@xmath2 , which is @xmath7 3.9015  .",
    "the total energies for monolayer fese with different magnetic orders are listed in tab.[tab : table 1 ] , which clearly shows that fese with col - afm order is more stable than other calculated magnetic states , in accordance with previous first - principles calculations . including the soc effect , the total energies for all the magnetic states are lowered by around 60 mev and fese with col - afm order still being the most stable one . in the afm",
    "ordered monolayer fese , the energy difference between fese with in - plane magnetization and out - plane magnetization is no more than 1 mev , as presented in the last two columns of tab.[tab : table 1 ] , revealing that the magnetic anisotropy energy should be quite small .",
    "however , the magnetization still tends to be parallel to the fe - plane rather than perpendicular to it , by a tiny energy difference varying from 0.4 mev to 1 mev depending on the particular afm order .",
    ".[tab : table 1 ] the total energies of monolayer fese with different magnetic orders .",
    "( the energies are in units of ev averaged on per fese formula cell ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      te@xmath0 calculated ( a ) with no soc and ( b ) including soc . ]",
    "next , we come to the electronic band structures of fese@xmath0te@xmath0 .",
    "figure 4 shows the band structures of paramagnetic fese@xmath0te@xmath0 , which resemble those of pure paramagnetic fese except that some degeneracy has been lifted . especially at m point , the band - splitting is conspicuous , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "the valence bands in pure paramagnetic fese at m only have one maximum ; in contrast , in fese@xmath0te@xmath0 the valence bands have a maximum on each side of the m point , i.e. along m - x path and m - x path the valence bands have symmetrical maximal points . besides , above the valence band maximum at m , the conduction bands also have an energy - splitting in fese@xmath0te@xmath0 .",
    "the different characters of bands near the m point is undoubtedly a consequence of the te - substitution . for a certain fe",
    "atom , m - x direction and m - x direction are not equivalent , since a se atom lies on one path above fe - plane while a te atom lies on the other path below fe - plane .",
    "including soc , the degeneracy is further lifted in the whole spectra , since soc impacts fese@xmath0te@xmath0 more than fese because a te atom is much heavier than a se atom , as mentioned before .",
    "te@xmath0 in cb - afm order .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) are band structures composed of electrons from different spin channels calculated without soc .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) are calculated including soc with in - plane magnetization and out - of - plane magnetization , respectively . ]    before moving to the afm ordered fese@xmath0te@xmath0 , we recall that in pristine fese the two spin channels have identical band structures .",
    "but in fese@xmath0te@xmath0 with cb - afm order , things are different . as shown in fig",
    ".  5(a ) and ( b ) , in each spin channel , there is a flat band below the fermi level forming a dirac cone which slightly deviates from m point .",
    "however , the dirac cones are on the different sides of the m point : it is on the m - x path for one spin channel while on the m - x path for another spin channel . these results can be explained in a similar way as comprehending the feature of the band structure of paramagnetic fese@xmath0te@xmath0 . there are two fe ions which have opposite magnetizations in a unit cell , meaning that one fe ion has more _ spin - up _ electrons and the other has more _ spin - down _ electrons .",
    "starting from the m point , we assume that the on - top se atoms are at the x direction of a fe atom with more spin - up electrons . accordingly , at the x direction of a fe atom with more spin - down electrons lie the bottom te atoms . as a result , for different spin channels , bands along m - x path will be different . nevertheless , the on - top se atoms are at the x direction of the fe atom with downward magnetization .",
    "thus the m - x path for spin - up electrons should be similar to the m - x path for spin - down electrons .",
    "but soc diminishes the above asymmetry along x - m - x path since the contributions from different spin channels have been added up .",
    "the flat band is split and there are gap - opening phenomena at the dirac cones for both in - plane and out - of - plane magnetizations .",
    "moreover , for the in - plane magnetization , the valence bands at @xmath17 point are pushed up to contact the fermi level .",
    "therefore , soc with in - plane magnetization has altered the band structures more remarkably than soc with out - of - plane magnetization .",
    "the band structures of fese@xmath0te@xmath0 with col - afm order are presented in fig .",
    "6 . compared with fig .",
    "3(f - h ) , te - substitution has not brought any essential changes . especially for band structures calculated without soc ,",
    "the three substitutional structures possess very similar band structures in which the dirac cone emerges in the middle of @xmath17-x path . as in pure fese with col - afm order , including soc effect with in - plane magnetization can open a band gap at the dirac cone , but soc together with out - of - plane magnetization can not open any gap in col - afm fese@xmath0te@xmath0 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "6(d - i ) .",
    "however , the band gaps in fese@xmath0te@xmath0 with col - afm ( 5.4 mev and 5.8 mev ) order are smaller than the band gap in pure fese ( 8.3 mev ) .",
    "in fact , the soc effect leads to various results in struc.1 to struc .",
    "3 . for example",
    ", the bands of struc.2 at the dirac cone have been merely pulled open at the fermi level without any splitting .",
    "but a rashba - dresselhuas splitting is observed at the same position in band structures of struc.1 and struc.3 .",
    "particularly , in struc.1 the splitting is so strong that the gap is actually closed again . as to the magnetization normal to fe - plane , the degeneracy of bands are different in the three configurations , but the dirac cones are all preserved .            finally , the band structures of fese@xmath0te@xmath0 with pcb - afm order are demonstrated .",
    "not including soc , the band structures of fese@xmath0te@xmath0 are similar to those of fese except for the valence bands at @xmath17 point .",
    "but these diversifications are not of major importance since they occur deep below the fermi level . on the other hand , including soc , the band structures manifest an insulating gap at the dirac cone in all three substitutional structures no matter whether the magnetization is in - plane or out - of - plane , as shown in fig .",
    "7(d - i ) . when the magnetic moments are in - plane , the band gap in struc.2 is the largest , which is 7.1 mev . in both struc.1 and struc.3 , there are rashba - dresshaus splittings which lead to band gaps of 4.6 mev and 2.7 mev , respectively .",
    "if the magnetization is normal to the fe - plane , the band gaps are larger than the gap in pure pcb - afm fese by several mev . comparing fig .",
    "7(d - f ) with fig . 7(g - i ) , one will find that soc with out - of - plane magnetization can open band gaps which are an order of magnitude larger than the gaps opened by soc with in - plane magnetization .",
    "however , except for the values of the band gap , the direction of the magnetization can not influence other part of the band structures much . in summary , with the pcb - afm order and out - of - plane magnetization , soc effect can open sizeable band gaps in fese@xmath0te@xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated the total energy , atomic structures and electronic band structures of monolayer fese@xmath0te@xmath0 as well as monolayer fese with paramagnetic state and different antiferromagnetic orders using first - principles calculations .",
    "the collinear ( col ) afm order is found to be the magnetic ground state for pure fese monolayer .",
    "for the te - substituted configurations , i.e. fese@xmath0te@xmath0 , the pair - checkerboard ( pcb ) afm order is always the most stable magnetic state .",
    "the band structures of afm ordered fese and fese@xmath0te@xmath0 all have dirac - cone - like features . including spin - orbit coupling , the dirac cones could be opened or could not , determined by the direction of the magnetic moments ( in - plane or out - of - plane ) .",
    "it is clear that soc effect is stronger in fese@xmath0te@xmath0 since te atoms are heavier than se atoms . besides , because of the symmetry breaking brought by te - substitution , the band structures have new characters of rashba - dresselhaus splitting in fese@xmath0te@xmath0 with col - afm and pcb - afm orders . but the band gaps of fese@xmath0te@xmath0 are not enlarged much compared to fese , which is in accordance with experiments where the superconductor gap and @xmath1 are not enhanced in fesete .",
