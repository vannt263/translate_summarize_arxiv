    "the star kuv 01584 - 0939 ( hereafter referred to as cet3 , as in the downes , webbink & shara ( 1997 ) catalogue of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ) was discovered during the kiso survey ( kondo , noguchi & maehara 1984 ) for ultraviolet rich objects .",
    "a spectrum of cet3 covering the wavelength range 4000  7100  was obtained by wegner , mcmahan & boley ( 1987 ) who drew attention to the great strength of heii emission and the weakness of the balmer emission lines .",
    "we have observed cet3 as part of a high time resolution photometric survey of faint cvs ( woudt & warner 2001 ) .",
    "our high speed photometric observations were made with the university of cape town ccd photometer ( odonoghue 1995 ) mounted on the 74-in radcliffe reflector at the sutherland site of the south african astronomical observatory on the nights of 18  21 october 2001 .",
    "cet3 is quite faint ( @xmath0 ) so we used ` white light ' , counting all photons detected by the ccd .",
    "the light curves for the three long observing runs , obtained on consecutive nights , are shown in figure  [ lccet3 ] .    from our observations",
    "we find that cet3 is a variable star with a period of 620.26 @xmath1 0.02 secs and a peak - to - peak range of @xmath20.15 mag .",
    "the fourier transform ( ft ) of our brightness measurements shows a fundamental and its harmonics .",
    "the presence of harmonics implies that the modulation is not sinusoidal . in figure  [ ftcet3 ]",
    "we present a compact view of the fts and the mean pulse profiles for each of the 4 observing runs .",
    "the mean pulse profiles are phased according to the ephemeris given in eqn .  1",
    ". there are only small changes in average profile from night to night , but individual pulse profiles vary as though there is some rapid flickering present . in figure  [ lccet3 ]",
    "it can also be seen that slow changes in mean brightness can also occur .",
    "we have found no persistent features in the fts other than the 620 s fundamental and its harmonics .",
    "the ephemeris for maximum light of cet3 , derived from a non - linear fit of sinusoids to the fundamental and the first two harmonics , is    @xmath3    photometric periods of 10@xmath4 ",
    "10@xmath5 s in stellar sources can originate from a number of different structures : including , e.g. , orbital periods of low mass x - ray binaries ( bradt & mcclintock 1983 ) containing a neutron star , or of the am cvn stars mentioned above , or the rotation periods of magnetic white dwarfs in cvs ( known as intermediate polars ( warner 1995a ) ) .",
    "we can exclude a number of other possibilities ( e.g. , pulsations ) because of the exceptional nature of the spectrum of cet3 .",
    "the latter also helps us to select from among the orbital or rotational options .    the most striking feature of the optical spectrum ( wegner et al .",
    "1987 ) of cet3 is the strength of the heii lines at 4026 and 4686  , and their presence at 4100 , 4199 and 5412  .",
    "the civ emission line at 5802  and the very blue continuum emphasize that the source is very hot .",
    "these identifications raise the possibility that the weak apparent balmer emission is not from hi : it is more probably the pickering series of heii , in which case cet3 is hydrogen deficient , probably belongs to the am cvn class of helium transferring interacting binaries , and the very blue continuum is that of an accretion process .",
    "no low mass x - ray binary or intermediate polar has a spectrum resembling that of cet3 .",
    "the slow changes in mean brightness and the presence of flickering are characteristics of a mass - transferring close binary system .",
    "am cvn stars evolve from normal composition binaries which have experienced two phases of mass exchange , exposing the helium cores of the original stars . during their orbital evolution such systems",
    "pass through a minimum period near 4 mins and thereafter evolve to longer periods ( tutukov & yungelson 1996 ) .",
    "the driving mechanism for orbital evolution in such short period binaries is loss of angular momentum through emission of gravitational radiation ( paczynski 1967 ) .",
    "this determines the rate of mass transfer , @xmath6 , and predicts ( warner 1995b ) values @xmath7 m@xmath8 y@xmath9 at @xmath10 = 10 min , decreasing steeply to @xmath11 m@xmath8 y@xmath9 at @xmath10 = 40 min .",
    "these rates are compatible with the range of observed properties of the seven optically observed ( warner 1995b ; ruiz et al .",
    "2001 ) am cvn stars and the x - ray system ( cropper et al .",
    "the latter ( v407 vul = rxj1914 + 24 ) has @xmath10 = 569 s , is thought to be a polar ( i.e. , the primary is strongly magnetic , so its rotation is synchronised with the revolution of the secondary ) , but is very faint optically because it is obscured by an interstellar cloud . in contrast",
    ", cet3 has a similar period and is relatively accessible at @xmath12 .",
    "if cet3 has @xmath13 m@xmath8 y@xmath9 , its accretion luminosity will be @xmath2 5 l@xmath8 for a 0.7 m@xmath8 white dwarf primary .",
    "most of this will be radiated at the inner boundary layer of the accretion disc at a temperature of @xmath14 k , so cet3 should be a soft x - ray source of high intrinsic luminosity .",
    "this also accounts for the strength of the helium and carbon ionic spectra in cet3 .",
    "we calculate that d@xmath10/d@xmath15 @xmath16 , which implies that d@xmath10/d@xmath15 should be measurable in only a few years of observations if the modulation indeed has an orbital origin .",
    "we have no means at present to estimate the distance of cet3 , but we expect it to be a strong source of gravitational radiation ( warner 1995b ; hils & bender 2000 )",
    ".    we can estimate parameters for cet3 in the following way .",
    "as the secondary must fill its roche lobe , a @xmath10 of 620 s implies a mean density @xmath17 gm @xmath18 ( see equation 2.3b of warner 1995a ) . from the mass - radius relation for low mass white dwarfs ( tutukov & yungelson 1996 )",
    ", this gives a mass for the secondary @xmath19 = 0.066 m@xmath8 .",
    "for an assumed primary mass @xmath20 = 0.7 m@xmath8 , we have @xmath21 = 0.094 and a binary separation of @xmath22 cm .",
    "cet 3 is a very compact system : from standard formulae ( warner 1995a ) we find an accretion disc radius @xmath23 cm , the radius @xmath24 of the secondary @xmath25 cm , and the radius of the primary @xmath26 cm .",
    "the accretion disc therefore extends only @xmath27 above the surface of the primary and will be strongly irradiated by the @xmath14 k source at the inner edge of the disc .",
    "in addition , for @xmath13 m@xmath8 y@xmath9 the maximum temperature in the disc itself is @xmath28 k. the surface of the secondary intercepts @xmath2 1% of the soft x - ray emission and , with allowance for shielding by the accretion disc , the side facing the primary will as a result be heated to @xmath29 k.    these parameters are of use in attempting to understand the modulation profile in cet3 . for a very small mass - ratio ( @xmath30 = 0.094 ) the accretion disc nearly fills the roche lobe of the primary ( warner 1995a ) and partial",
    "eclipses of the disc are quite probable .",
    "the shallow but wide minima in the cet3 light curve could therefore be eclipse features .",
    "the profile could alternatively be a combination of reflection effects from the secondary and aspect effects of the disc and bright spot .",
    "however , a small mass ratio @xmath30 and high @xmath6 usually result in perturbation of the accretion disc into an elliptical form with consequent precession ( warner 1995a ) .",
    "the am cvn stars with high @xmath6 show ` superhumps ' with periods a few percent longer than @xmath10 , which result from the tidal stresses in a precessing disc ( patterson et al .  2001 ) .",
    "it is probable , therefore , that the modulation in cet3 is a permanent superhump , in which case @xmath10 will be slightly shorter than the period we have measured .",
    "alternatively , cet3 may be a polar like v407 vul ( the absence of two distinct periods disfavours an intermediate polar interpretation ) .",
    "it should be possible to distinguish between these various interpretations when high time resolution spectroscopy is available .",
