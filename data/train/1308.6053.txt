    ", ir , and uv were comparable around log(t)=6.8 and log(mass)=4.3 in geneva model for har-2 , har-3 , and har-4 , while i has an offset by @xmath8 0.4 dex , which corresponds to @xmath81 magnitude and a factor of @xmath82.5 .",
    "though the consistency in the padova model was not as good as that of the geneva model , the best - fit mass and age were comparable .    the disagreement of the estimated mass and age among the data might be explained partly by the difference in aperture sizes .",
    "as uv resolution was worse , it required the largest aperture ( r=6 arcsec ) , and may include contaminants , which made the observed luminosity larger and shifted the lines in figure [ fig : sb99 ] upward .",
    "however , ir had a smaller aperture ( r=3 arcsec ) than uv , and  is based on na659 photometry , which was aperture photometry of 2.5 @xmath16 kron radius ( @xmath27 ) .",

    "the disagreement also could come from model uncertainties and adopted assumptions , such as initial mass function ( imf ) , instantaneous star formation , and/or dust extinction model .",
    "a possible model is to divide the region into several sub - regions and to assume different extinctions .",
    "for example , if some part has a large extinction , uv is suppressed and optical and ir fluxes could be larger relative to uv and .",
    "in fact , har-2 consisted of sub - clumps with various extinctions . though we can consider various star - formation histories and models , it is beyond the scope of this study",
    "we do not go further to tune the star - formation histories and the models .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sb99 ] , har-1 shows large disagreement of the mass and the age among the data .",
    "since har-1 would have a smaller mass , which was expected from fainter i - band magnitude , it may have suffered a stochastic effect on imf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in table [ tab : redshift ] , har-1 and 2 are 66 kpc and har-3 and 4 are 35 kpc away from ngc  4388 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite assumed that the age of the  cloud is @xmath8 200  myr , and estimated the projected velocity of ngc  4388 to the cloud was 500 km s@xmath11 if we adopt the value as the relative velocity of hars to ngc  4388 , it should take 130  myr ( har-1 and 2 ) and 70  myr ( har-3 and 4 ) to reach the distance .",
    "since the time - scales are longer than the stellar age estimated above , it suggests that the star formation in hars began after the gas left the host galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction by @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : sfregions ] summarizes the literature concerning a stripped tail in nearby clusters of galaxies . since the environment and physical condition of the tails ( the ambient gas temperature and density , the relative velocity",
    ", the density of the tail , etc ) shows a variety . we can not compare them directly .",
    "we can at least say that har-1 and 2 are the most distant star - forming regions in the table , and har-1 may be the least massive region .",
    "also , we can say that @xmath28 m@xmath4 and @xmath6 yr star - forming regions in a stripped tail are not peculiar objects .",
    "the age of the regions in @xcite is substantially larger than the others probably because a different model of the star - formation history was adopted .",
    "the mass estimation is not affected by the different star - formation history .",
    "the detection of the star - forming regions was based on   and/or uv emissions , and therefore the sampling should be biased to the younger age .",
    "the detailed heliocentric velocity distributions of   showed that the intensity of the  at the har-1,2 field had a wide peak around the recession velocity @xmath8 2240 km s@xmath11 ( intensity - weighted mean ) with width @xmath8 150 km s@xmath11 .",
    "har-1 and 2 are just on the peak .",
    "this means that the star - forming regions had only small peculiar velocity relative to the ambient   cloud along the line of sight .",
    "meanwhile , hi at har-3,4 field showed no significant peak . since the star formation in stripped tail",
    "is thought to occur in the highest - density regions @xcite , it is puzzling that the   flux at har-3,4 field was low .",
    "as we reported in paper i , the tail of ngc  4388 is accompanied by a relatively cool x - ray gas , and the distribution of x - ray emission showed a marginal enhancement at the downstream of har-3,4 .",
    "the   gas around har-3 and 4 might already have evaporated , except for the densest region .",
    "another possibility is that such dense clouds are less affected by ram pressure , and left behind the   gas @xcite .",
    "the 2d spectrum and the slit profile of har-2 ( figures [ fig:2dspec],[fig : xprof ] ) shows that the -strong region ( har-2a ) appears left to the continuum regions ( har-2b ) .",
    "they resemble the _ fireballs _ found in the ram - pressure stripped tail in rb199 in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "if the gas cloud ( har-2a , 2c ) is now free from the ram pressure , the gas and stars would move similarly . on the other hand , because the ram pressure affects differently the stars and the gas , it would cause a differential movement between the gas and the stars .",
    "the positional shift between the gas and the stars implies that ram - pressure deceleration is still working here , 66 kpc away from the host galaxy .",
    "another possible explanation for the offset is that the gas has been consumed from the leading edge of the cloud , and the star formation is propagated to the following regions .    in har-4 ,",
    "a plume also existed on the other side of the parent galaxy . in har-3 , however , the tail appeared on the side of the parent galaxy .",
    "the direction was coincident to har-4 .",
    "the projected distance between har-3 and har-4 was about 1.0 kpc and the difference of the recession velocity was 30 km s@xmath11 .",
    "if their mass is @xmath29 m@xmath30 , the velocity difference is so large that they can not be gravitationally bound .",
    "if har-3 and har-4 had experienced an encounter in the past , it means that such a small - scale motion existed in the tail .    illuminated by the stars of the m86 envelope , a dark filamentary cloud was recognized around har-1 and har-2 .",
    "a high contrast image in v - band is shown as figure [ fig : dc ] . in optical bands of figure [ fig : stamps12 ] ,",
    "the cloud was also recognized .",
    "the dark cloud shows an elongated and twisting shape .",
    "the length was @xmath8110 arcsec ( 7 kpc ) and the width was @xmath87 arcsec ( 600 pc ) around har-2 .",
    "it is uncertain whether the dark cloud is associated with the ngc  4388 tail , an accidental overlap of a dark cloud of m86 , or even if it is another dark cloud .",
    "however , as such filaments of the dark cloud are only recognized along the   tail of ngc  4388 , it is likely that the dark cloud is associated with the ngc  4388   tail .",
    "these filaments of the dark cloud do not show any  emitting regions except that with har-1 and har-2 .",
    "as there are only few star - forming regions along the tail , it is unlikely that the dusts were created in the tail , and the origin of the dusts should be ngc  4388 .",
    "it implies that the dusts were affected by the ram - pressure .",
    "the ram - pressure stripping of dusts from disk of galaxies in the virgo cluster was suggested by several authors ; ngc  4402 by @xcite , ngc  4438 by @xcite , and ngc  4330 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied hi - deficient galaxies in the virgo cluster , and found that dust is stripped in the cluster environment as well as gas .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the coincidence of the ram - pressure stripping of hi ,  and the dust in ic  4040 .",
    "the elongated and twisting shape of the dark cloud downstream of har-1 and har-2 may also be explained as a result of the ram pressure which is still effective around the regions .    in paper",
    "i , we showed evidence that m86 is more distant than the ngc  4388 tail .",
    "the total extinction of the cloud was estimated by assuming that the background m86 light was smooth .",
    "the estimated extinction at a region between har-1 and har-2 was @xmath8 15% and @xmath8 10% in v - band and in r - band , respectively .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath31 . as the @xmath32 estimated from the balmer decrement in har-1",
    "is much larger as @xmath32= 0.59@xmath33 , it is suggested that the dust in the dark filament would be locally dense around the star - forming regions .",
    "based on the argument by @xcite , we discuss the star formation in the molecular clouds that later shine as the observed  emitting regions .",
    "@xcite derived the relation between the mass of a cloud @xmath34 and the star - formation efficiency @xmath35 when the cloud is under pressure @xmath36 .",
    "we estimate in paper i that the ram - pressure on ngc  4388 and the clouds should be @xmath37 . in section [ sec : mass - age ] , we found that the total mass of stars in each  emitting region is @xmath38@xmath39 . assuming that @xmath40 , the mass of the molecular cloud before the stars were born is @xmath41 because @xmath42 ( lower part of figure  4 in @xcite ) . for this mass and pressure ,",
    "the time - scale of star formation in the cloud is @xmath43  yr ( upper part of figure  4 in @xcite ; they referred to the time - scale as disruption time ) , which is consistent with the age of the stars in the regions ( @xmath5  yr ) .",
    "@xcite also discussed the disruption of the clouds by kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability via interaction with the ambient icm .",
    "the relation among @xmath34 , @xmath36 and the cloud radius @xmath44 before star formation starts is given by @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath34 and @xmath36 we estimated , the cloud radius was @xmath46  pc .",
    "the time - scale of the development of kh instability is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the density inside the cloud , and @xmath49 is the relative velocity between the cloud and the icm @xcite .",
    "we estimate in paper i that @xmath50 , and thus we obtain @xmath51  yr . since @xmath52 , the cloud could marginally produce the stars before kh instability develops .",
    "this may indicate that no magnetic fields are required to protect the cloud from the development of kh instability @xcite .      from the  luminosity , the  ionizing photon emission rate of har-1 was 10@xmath53 s@xmath11 .",
    "assuming case - b recombination , the logarithm of the total hydrogen ionizing photon emission rate @xmath54 was @xmath55 . according to @xcite ,",
    "a single b0v dwarf is enough to produce the photon rate , and other stars such as b giants and o dwarfs would make too much .",
    "however , a single b0v star is insufficient to reproduce the observed nuv magnitude .",
    "the absolute v magnitude of b0v star is -4 ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nuv - v color of b0v was calculated with empirical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) by @xcite as -1.0 mag .",
    "the absolute nuv magnitude is therefore @xmath56 .",
    "meanwhile , the absolute magnitudes of har-1 converted from observed nuv magnitudes and the internal extinction correction was -8.8@xmath100.7 mag .",
    "the observed uv magnitudes were @xmath57 mag brighter .",
    "the uv - optical color was also inconsistent with the following models .",
    "we calculated the @xmath58 color of various seds , and found that the bluest stars are o9v ",
    "b0v ( nuv - i@xmath8 - 1.7 ) . the observed lower limit of nuv - i color of har-1 was @xmath59 , and if we correct the internal extinction of @xmath60 , the color is @xmath61 .",
    "the model seds , internal extinction estimated from the balmer decrement , the extinction law , and the factor of 0.44 were therefore inconsistent with the observed color .",
    "in the   tail of ngc  4388 in the virgo cluster , we identified four star - forming systems at a projected distance of 35 kpc and 66 kpc away from the parent galaxy .",
    "main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the line ratios show typical  regions of solar metallicity , with recession velocity comparable to that of  tail , which supports the idea that they are associated with the tail .",
    "2 .   the  luminosity and multiband photometry are fit with a burst model ( starburst99 ) , and we obtained reasonable solutions within 0.3 dex . from the fitting ,",
    "the mass is 10@xmath62 m@xmath4 and the age is @xmath5 years , except for the faintest one ( har-1 ) .",
    "the faintest one would have mass smaller than @xmath63 m@xmath4 , and was not fitted well , possibly because of the stochastic effect .",
    "their young age and large projected distance means that they were formed after they were removed from the parent galaxy .",
    "this supports the theoretical prediction by @xcite .",
    "the estimated age and mass , and the ram - pressure estimated in paper i suggested that a magnetic field to protect the cloud from kelvin - helmholz instability @xcite may not be necessary for the clouds .",
    "one of the regions at 66 kpc away from ngc  4388 ( har-2 ) shows an offset of  emission from stars ( fireball feature ) .",
    "this implies that ram - pressure is still effective here .",
    "5 .   two of the regions ( har-3,4 ) exist out of  distribution .",
    "evaporation of the   and/or the different deceleration by ram - pressure between the   gas and the condensed region may explain the result .",
    "two of the regions ( har-1,2 ) lay at a leading edge of a filamentary dark cloud .",
    "the cloud would have been stripped from ngc  4388 by the ram - pressure .",
    "the extinction of the dark cloud is smaller than the internal extinction of the regions .",
    "the dust in the dark cloud would be locally dense around the star - forming regions .",
    "as the spectroscopic observation of this study was not a complete sampling of the  emitting regions along the tail , we did not investigate the global features in the tail such as total star - formation rate .",
    "a future complete survey of the candidates of the star - forming region will quantitatively set the constraints on the star - formation models in the tail .",
