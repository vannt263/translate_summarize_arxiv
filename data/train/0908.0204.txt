    "there is nowadays compelling evidence that the processes of the formation and evolution of galaxies and the nuclear activity are intimately linked .",
    "the most direct link at low redshift is the correlation of the mass of the central black holes with the luminosity ( mass ) and the stellar velocity dispersion of the spheroids where they reside , in both inactive and active galaxies ( see ferrarese 2006 for a review ) .",
    "if this link holds also at higher redshift , the observed population of high redshift quasars traces the existence of @xmath3 m@xmath4 supermassive bhs and massive spheroids at very early ( @xmath5 1 gyr ) cosmic epochs @xcite .",
    "moreover , the strong cosmological evolution of the quasar population @xcite is similar to the star formation history in the universe ( madau et al .",
    "1998 ; see also lapi et al . , 2006 ) . according to the hierarchical merging scenarios for structure formation and evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the massive spheroidals should be the products of successive merger events , and the properties of quasar hosts ( mass , luminosity , size ) should show a redshift dependence .",
    "moreover , the quasar activity is expected to deposit large amounts of energy in the spheroid , possibly suppressing star formation ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ) .    in this context , the direct detection and characterization of high redshift quasar host galaxies is crucial to understand the joint cosmic assembly and evolution of bulges of galaxies and their central black holes . in particular ,",
    "a key point is to probe the quasar host properties up to and beyond the epoch of the peak of quasar activity ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "low redshift ( @xmath7 ) quasars are hosted in galaxies containing a luminous , massive bulge component that becomes dominant in radio - loud objects and at high nuclear luminosity @xcite .",
    "their stellar populations are believed to be relatively old , especially in _ very luminous _",
    "agn compared to their inactive counterparts @xcite . however , there is some imaging and spectroscopic evidence for relatively young / intermediate age stellar populations in some low redshift agn host galaxies , even in apparently quiescent ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the detection and characterization of the host galaxies of high redshift quasars is challenging since the quasar luminosity overwhelms the extended emission from the galaxy , especially in optical imaging , corresponding to rest - frame uv emission .",
    "furthermore , the host galaxy surface brightness decreases rapidly with redshift . in order to cope with these difficulties , imaging with high spatial resolution and s / n together with a well defined point spread function ( psf ) are essential .",
    "systematic reliable studies of the host galaxies of @xmath8 quasars have thus became available only recently thanks to the use of near - infrared ( nir ) imaging , where the nucleus - host luminosity ratio is more favourable , allowing to detect the old stellar population at high redshift .",
    "concerning the stellar population , only few studies have been performed at high redshift ( z @xmath9 0.5 ) so far .    in the largest study of quasar host galaxies available up to now",
    "@xcite , we carried out systematic imaging with the 8 m very large telescope ( vlt ) and the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( hereafter , isaac ) of 32 quasars in the redshift range @xmath10 , to characterize their host galaxies .",
    "the sample includes both radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) and radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , and it covers a wide range of the quasar luminosities .",
    "we found that the luminosity evolution of both rlq and rqq hosts is consistent with that of massive inactive ellipticals undergoing passive evolution .    beyond @xmath1 , detecting the host galaxies",
    "becomes extremely difficult , even with the state - of - art observational techniques .",
    "so far , only a few individual objects have been reported to be resolved @xcite mainly following three different approaches : * ( 1 ) * observations from space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , provide an excellent narrow psf but are usually limited by the small collecting area of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "furthermore , the psf of the images taken with the hst wfpc2 are undersampled , leading to a systematic overestimate of the flux from the host galaxy ( see kim et al .",
    "note that this undersampling does not apply to images taken with acs and nicmos . *",
    "( 2 ) * the extended emission from the host galaxies is naturally magnified in gravitationally lensed quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the drawback in this approach is that the psf of the lensed targets is difficult to characterize , and the lens galaxy may contaminate the emission from the quasar host , making its detection extremely uncertain . *",
    "( 3 ) * ground - based imaging with adaptive optics ( ao ) @xcite usually satisfies the severe constrains in the spatial resolution required to disentangle the extended emission of the host galaxies from the nuclear one . in our previous studies @xcite , we obtained ks - band images of quasars in the redshift range @xmath0 using the ao system naco at eso vlt , which allowed us to clearly resolve two rlqs and two rqqs .",
    "the drawback in this approach is of statistical nature .",
    "in fact all current ao systems require a very bright star to be present close to the target .",
    "this therefore strongly limits the number of observable objects .",
    "this limitation should be overcome with the next generation of ao systems using artificial guide stars . * ( 4 ) * another possibility , that we shall address in this paper , is to focus on high-@xmath11 quasars of low luminosity where the nuclear - to - host luminosity ratio is more favorable .",
    "this ensures that , even without ao , the host galaxies can be detected and characterized from deep , nir ground - based observations obtained in excellent natural seeing conditions .",
    "moreover , the much larger field of view of non - ao images allows a significantly better characterization of the psf from field stars .    in this paper",
    ", we present a deep , high resolution imaging study with vlt / isaac of a sample of @xmath6 radio - quiet quasars with relatively _ low nuclear luminosity _ , aimed at the study of their host galaxies .",

    "with these constrains , the search produced @xmath21 quasars , from which we extracted a sample of 16 rqqs with the most favourable observability from paranal ( chile ) , covering the full redshift range .",

    "isaac is equipped with a 1024 @xmath23 1024 pxl hawaii rockwell array , with a pixel scale of 0148 px@xmath13 , giving a field of view of @xmath24 arcsec@xmath20 .",
    "the observations were performed in service mode under photometric conditions in the period between 2006 march and september .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table [ tabjournal ] .",
    "the seeing , as derived from the fwhm size of stars in each frame , was mostly excellent during the observations , ranging from @xmath2504 to @xmath2506 ( average and median fwhm @xmath2505 , see table [ tabjournal ] ) .",
    "note that at the redshift of the targets , observations in the ks - band probe the host galaxy at rest - frame 5500  7000  , roughly the r - band , thus allowing an easy comparison with optical studies at lower redshift .",

    "all targets but one ( 2qzj124029 - 0010 ) were observed in two or three obs of equal length . since",
    "no significant discrepancy were found in the sky surface brightness and the seeing from the psf of field stars between the different obs for each target , we opted to combine all the individual images of each target .",
    "data reduction was performed using our own improved version of the eso pipeline for jitter imaging data @xcite .",
    "each frame was dark  subtracted and flat  fielded by a normalized flat field obtained from twilight sky images .",
    "sky subtraction was performed using median averaged and scaled sky frames obtained combining jittered exposures of the same field .",
    "subtracted images were aligned to sub  pixel accuracy , and co  added .",
    "combined images are trimmed into a @xmath26 pixel ( @xmath27 arcmin@xmath20 ) frame , covered by all the individual exposures .",
    "finally , a polynomial surface was fitted to the combined image , after masking main sources , in order to remove spurious gradients in the background counts due to sky variations during the integration .",
    "photometric calibration was performed from comparison with 2mass magnitudes of bright stars available in the field .",
    "the estimated internal photometric accuracy is @xmath28 mag .",
    "data analysis was carried out using aida ( astronomical image decomposition and analysis ; uslenghi & falomo , 2008 ) , an idl - based software package designed to perform two  dimensional model fitting of quasar images , providing simultaneous decomposition into nuclear and host galaxy components .",
    "the applied procedure is described in detail in kotilainen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and briefly summarized here .      the most critical part of the analysis is the determination of the psf model and the estimate of the background level around the target , which may strongly affect the faint signal from the object . to model the psf shape ,",
    "we used field stars in each frame , selected on the basis of their fwhm , sharpness , roundness and s / n ratio , including bright , slightly saturated stars , in order to properly model the faint wing of the psf . a careful check of the light profiles and contour plot of each star let us exclude marginally resolved galaxies and stars with close companions .",
    "each star was then modeled with four two - dimensional gaussians , representing the core of the psf , and an exponential feature , representing the extended wing of the psf .",
    "regions contaminated by nearby sources , saturated pixels and other defects affecting the images were masked out .",
    "the local background was computed in a circular annulus centered on the star , and its uncertainty was estimated from the standard deviation of the values computed in sectors of concentric sub - annuli included in this area .",
    "finally , the region used in the fit was selected by defining an internal and an external radius of a circular area , allowing the exclusion of the core of bright , saturated stars .",
    "> from the comparison of the resulting light profiles ( see fig . [ figprofpsf ] ) , no systematic dependence of the psf was observed in the field of view .",
    "thus , the same model was fitted simultaneously to all the usable stars of the image .",
    "the uncertainty of the psf model was estimated by comparing the analytical fit with the individual observed star profiles , and adding a fixed term ( @xmath29 mag / arcsec@xmath20 ) to account for possible systematic effects due to underlying assumptions in the data reduction ( e.g. zero point and psf stability , and perfect alignments in the de - jitter procedure ) .",
    "panel * e ) * in fig . [ figprofpsf ]",
    "shows the residual of psf modeling together with the estimated uncertainty .      in order to evaluate whether the targets are resolved , we first fitted each quasar image using only the psf model .",
    "if the residuals revealed a significant excess over the psf shape in the @xmath30@xmath31 arcsec range ( where the contribution of the nuclear psf quickly diminishes , while the contribution from the host galaxy signal becomes sufficiently high and detectable ) , the target was considered resolved .",
    "an example of the residuals after the psf subtraction , for a resolved target , is presented in fig .",
    "[ figprofb ] , upper panel .",
    "the resolved targets were then fitted with a two component model ( psf+galaxy ) . at high redshift , it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between bulge and exponential disk models from the luminosity distributions .",
    "we assumed that the host galaxies can be represented as elliptical galaxies with a de vaucouleurs r@xmath32 profile .",
    "this choice is motivated by the strong evidence at low redshift for the predominance of bulge dominated hosts of quasars ( e.g. hamilton et al .",
    "2002 ; dunlop et al . 2003 ;",
    "pagani et al . 2003 ) .",
    "if instead of a bulge - dominated model , we adopt an exponential disk law , all the objects can still be reasonably well fitted .",
    "the main difference is that the host galaxy luminosity become @xmath33 mag fainter for a disk model , but this does not significantly affect the results of this paper .    in only two cases ( 2qzj124029 - 0010 and 2qzj222702 - 3205 ) ,",
    "the host galaxy detection was considered good enough to be able to firmly pin down the effective radius @xmath34 .",
    "for all the other objects in the sample , we opted to set @xmath34 equal to 5 kpc in the modeling , following the indication of previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we note that , within our adopted cosmological framework , 5 kpc corresponds to @xmath35 arcsec at @xmath36 , comparable with the typical angular resolution of our data . in order to evaluate the effect on the host luminosity of assuming a more compact host galaxy , we re - performed the modelling of all the resolved targets assuming @xmath34 = 2.5 kpc . with only two exceptions ,",
    "the host galaxy magnitudes are consistent within 0.3 mag .",

    "the two exceptions are q2125 - 4432 and 2qz231751 - 3147 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively ) , both of which have very faint host galaxies , close to the envelope of the unresolved targets , and therefore are likely to have larger uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , the models of 2qz231751 - 3147 have a highly elongated profile shape , suggesting that this object is peculiar .",
    "the number of unresolved targets remains unchanged irrespective of the assumed @xmath34 , since the resolved / unresolved classification only depends on the comparison between the observed light profile and the modelled psf , independently of any other assumption on the shape of the host galaxy .",
    "targets showing no residuals in the light profile after the psf subtraction exceeding the psf model uncertainty were considered unresolved .",
    "an example of an unresolved target is provided in fig .",

    "2005 ) , in the sense that the more massive elliptical galaxies formed their stars in relatively shorter bursts of intense star formation and at higher redshift ( z @xmath82 ) , compared to less massive galaxies .",
    "recent merger events , if and when they occur , do not significantly affect the content of the stellar population of massive galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the formation of lower luminosity galaxies is shifted toward lower redshifts , having significant star formation present at all epochs ( see e.g. renzini 2006 , scarlata et al .",
    "2007 , vergani et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we stress that while the case of the evolution of a single burst population formed at high redshift provides an adequate explanation for our results , we can not rule out other models , accounting for the accretion of the galaxy mass due to mergers and different stellar history recipes . while a nave model with galaxies experiencing substantial mass accretion is not consistent with the data , a more complex model in which episodic star formation counter - weights the mass accretion of galaxies is formally acceptable .",
    "nevertheless , we prefer an interpretation in which such a coincidence is not necessary .",
    "a more detailed modelling of the evolution and the star formation history of the host galaxies , that takes into account the role of the active nucleus is required . however",
    ", that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finally , we note that the assumption of a different sed of the stellar population does not affect significantly our results , since the rest - frame r ",
    "ks color addressed in this paper is fairly insensitive to the age of the stellar population .",
    "we have presented homogeneous high resolution nir images for a sample of 16 low luminosity rqqs in the redshift range @xmath0 , to characterize the properties and the cosmological evolution of their host galaxies , in conjunction with data at lower redshift .",
    "the host galaxy was resolved in eleven quasars out of the 16 , while the remaining were unresolved .",
    "the rqqs in our sample have @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "comparing our new data with literature data at @xmath6 and at lower redshift , we found that the quasar host galaxies follow the trend in luminosity of massive inactive ellipticals ( with m(r ) ranging between @xmath46 and @xmath83 at @xmath6 , or @xmath84 and @xmath85 at z=0 ) undergoing passive evolution .",
    "this represents a fundamental constraint for models of galaxy formation and evolution and throws new light on our understanding of the interplay between the black holes , nuclear activity and the host galaxy evolution .    to definitely pin down the host galaxy assembly history , a large observational effort in increasing the sample of resolved host galaxies at @xmath86",
    "is required , in order to increase the statistical significance of the present results and to sample a wider parameter space , whether in the n / h ratio , in the host galaxy luminosity , or in the level of quasar radio emission .",
    "further observations with very high s / n and a very narrow , extremely reliable psf , eventually thanks to laser guide star assisted ao in nir will play a crucial role .",
    "improved knowledge about the colours and environments of quasar host galaxies will also be needed to test the predictions of galaxy formation models . finally , in a forthcoming paper ( decarli et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , we will compare the luminosity of the host galaxies of high redshift quasars with their black hole masses , as derived from the spectroscopy of their broad emission lines .",
    "this will enable a direct test of the evolution of the black hole mass  host galaxy relations up to @xmath87 .",
