    "the chermnykh s problem is new kind of restricted three body problem which was first time studied by @xcite . given numerical exploration of chermnykh s problem , in which the equilibrium points and zero velocity curves studied numerically also the non - linear stability for the triangular lagrangian points are computed numerically for the earth - moon and sun - jupiter mass distribution when the angular velocity varies .",
    "the mass reduction factor @xmath0 is expressed in terms of the particle radius @xmath1 , density @xmath2 radiation pressure efficiency factor @xmath3 ( in c.g.s .",
    "system):@xmath4 . where @xmath5 is solar radiation pressure force which is exactly apposite to the gravitational attraction force @xmath6 and change with the distance by the same law it is possible to consider that the result of action of this force will lead to reducing the effective mass of the sun or particle .",
    "@xcite examined the linear stability of triangular equilibrium points in the generalized photogravitational restricted three body problem with poynting - robertson drag , @xmath7 and @xmath8 points became unstable due to p - r drag which is very remarkable and important , where as they are linearly stable in classical problem when @xmath9 .",
    "further the normalizations of hamiltonian and nonlinear stability of @xmath10 in the present of p - r drag has been studied by    normal forms are a standard tool in hamiltonian mechanics to study the dynamics in a neighbourhood of invariant objects .",
    "usually , these normal forms are obtained as divergent series , but their asymptotic character is what makes them useful . from theoretical point of view , they provide nonlinear approximations to the dynamics in a neighbourhood of the invariant object , that allows to obtain information about the real solutions of the system by taking the normal form upto a suitable finite order . in this case , it is well known that under certain(generic ) non - resonance conditions , the remainder of this finite normal form turns out to be exponentially small with respect to some parameters .",
    "those series are usually divergent on open sets , it is still possible in some cases to prove convergence on certain sets with empty interior(cantor - like sets ) by replacing the standard linear normal form scheme by a quadratic one .    from a more practical point of view , normal forms can be used as a computational method to obtain very accurate approximations to the dynamics in a neighbourhood of the selected invariant object , by neglecting the remainder .",
    "they have been applied , for example , to compute invariant manifolds or invariant tori . to do that",
    ", it is necessary to compute the explicit expression of the normal form and of the ( canonical ) transformation that put the hamiltonian into this reduced form .",
