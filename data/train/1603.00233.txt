    "the most fascinating aspect of the casimir effect is that it attributes a physical significance to the vacuum zero - point energy of electromagnetic radiation  @xcite .",
    "this is all the more surprising as electromagnetic zero - point energy seems initially to be a theoretical malfunction , a spurious divergence that should be ignored .",
    "an infinite zero - point energy for quantum fields is a simple consequence of their description as a continuum of quantum harmonic oscillators , where all oscillation frequencies may occur  @xcite .",
    "casimir theory attributes a real existence to a finite part of the electromagnetic zero - point energy and pressure , a part that is determined by macroscopic objects and that in turn exerts forces on those objects  @xcite .",
    "experimental confirmation of casimir forces allows us to take seriously an electromagnetic vacuum state whose energy density and pressure have a spatial and frequency structure that is determined by the electromagnetic susceptibilities of macroscopic materials .",
    "but the detailed structure of the electromagnetic vacuum state is not usually described in casimir calculations because only the total vacuum energy , or total vacuum pressure at material boundaries , is required to find the forces .",
    "moreover the sum over all frequency contributions to the force is invariably carried out as a sum over imaginary frequencies , which obscures the spectrum of the vacuum state since each imaginary - frequency component has contributions from all real frequencies . here",
    "we study the electromagnetic vacuum state in the simplest non - trivial case and show that individual modes of light can have zero - point energies that are damped ( decreased ) by coupling to macroscopic materials .",
    "these damped vacuum states of light are an interesting addition to the single - mode states routinely discussed in the quantum - optics textbooks  @xcite .",
    "most treatments of casimir energy are focussed on the total energy rather than on the energy of individual modes  @xcite",
    ". moreover idealized boundary conditions are often assumed  @xcite . in  @xcite the casimir energy and stress of individual frequencies",
    "was studied but only by making use of idealized material properties that violate kramers - kronig relations .",
    "here we consider dielectric functions that exhibit dispersion and absorption consistent with kramers - kronig relations , as is required for accurate theoretical predictions of the casimir effect .",
    "casimir energy quantifies forces between objects through its derivative with respect to the separation distances of the objects .",
    "the casimir force is also determined by the zero - point electromagnetic stress tensor , which is the most common method for computing the force  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the casimir energy can be calculated separately from the stress tensor , by means of the conserved quantity associated with time - translation symmetry ( for non - moving materials )  @xcite . the casimir energy obtained in this manner",
    "gives a force that agrees with that obtained from the stress tensor  @xcite , but part of the energy does not contribute to the force .",
    "this last fact is due to a self - energy contribution from material inhomogeneities ( including sharp boundaries ) that does not cause a force between separated objects .",
    "a complete description of casimir energy must include such self - energy contributions , as they are necessarily present if one adopts the standard view that time - translation symmetry gives energy through noether s theorem .",
    "the role of self - energy contributions has been recognised in discussions of the gravitational effects of casimir energy  @xcite . here",
    "we will consider the zero - point energy of individual ( real ) frequencies , including self - energy contributions .",
    "a regularization of the zero - point energy is required to obtain the physical casimir energy as the total zero - point energy always diverges . as we consider realistic materials that obey kramers - kronig relations , the regularizaton is the standard one employed in the prediction of casmir forces through the stress tensor  @xcite .",
    "casimir forces are intimately connected to thermal radiation  @xcite and our approach here is similar to investigations of the effect of material boundaries on the thermal spectrum  @xcite .",
    "also closely related are studies of the spatial variation in the local electromagnetic density of states caused by materials , an effect that can be probed by spontaneous emission  @xcite . in those investigations , it is the properties of light outside the materials , including close to the boundaries , that are relevant .",
    "our interest here however is in the energy density of each mode throughout space , which crucially includes the regions inside the materials .",
    "we are also motivated by the developing subject of nanomechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "the physics of such systems may be modelled as quantum oscillators that are damped by coupling to reservoirs representing the environment .",
    "although the link to nanomechanical systems is not often made , the quantum theory of macroscopic electromagnetism is also a theory of quantum damped harmonic oscillators and can be formulated exactly as a quantized theory of light coupled to a reservoir  @xcite .",
    "results for the behavior of quantum light modes in macroscopic electromagnetism are therefore instructive for studies of nanomechanical systems .     and magnetic permeability @xmath0 .",

    "the surrounding region is vacuum , written as the vacuum limit @xmath5 of another material .",

    "the block has boundaries at @xmath3 and @xmath4 and is surrounded by vacuum , but for technical reasons ( see below ) the vacuum region is represented as the vacuum limit @xmath5 of a different dielectric .",
    "our interest is in the effect of this block on the quantum vacuum state of light , and to simplify the analysis as much as possible we consider only light modes linearly polarized in the @xmath1-direction and propagating in the @xmath6-direction .",
