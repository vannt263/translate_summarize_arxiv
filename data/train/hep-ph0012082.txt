    "the last supernova in our galaxy that was visible on earth was observed in 1604 .",
    "back then , astronomers marveled at `` kepler s star '' in ophiuchus and studied the light curve from the colossal explosion .",
    "the next galactic supernova will differ from previous ones in human history .",
    "not only will astronomical observations be made across the electromagnetic spectrum ; it is likely that several neutrino detectors will detect the burst of neutrinos emerging from the stellar gravitational collapse . indeed",
    ", it may turn out that the next galactic supernova will not be seen optically , due to obscuration ( as was probably the case for the radio source supernova remnant cassiopeia a ) , and that supernova neutrino detection will signal the astrophysical event , triggering its search in electromagnetic bands .",
    "the field of extrasolar neutrino astrophysics was born when neutrinos from sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud were detected by the imb  @xcite and kamiokande  @xcite neutrino detectors .",
    "these pioneering observations contributed significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in a supernova explosion , as well as providing interesting limits on neutrino properties .",
    "the next galactic supernova will prove even more valuable owing to the abundance of neutrino events produced by the closer source and the variety of reactions that will be available to study these neutrinos .",
    "superkamiokande  @xcite and sno  @xcite will be the largest supernova neutrino detectors in the foreseeable future .",
    "superkamiokande contains about 50,000 tons of water , providing proton targets for the inverse @xmath6 decay reaction .",
    "the sno detector is filled with a kiloton of heavy water that offers deuterons for neutrino interactions .",
    "detectors employing liquid scintillator that will be capable of detecting supernova neutrinos include baksan  @xcite , lvd  @xcite , macro  @xcite , borexino  @xcite , and kamland  @xcite . in a liquid scintillator ( typical composition ch@xmath7 )",
    ", the antineutrino - proton reactions will still constitute the majority of the detected supernova neutrino events .",
    "nevertheless , the abundance of carbon in an organic liquid scintillator provides an additional , interesting target for neutrino interactions  @xcite .",
    "neutrino reactions on the @xmath2c nucleus @xmath8 include the superallowed transitions to the a=12 triad @xmath9 of @xmath2b ( ground state ) , @xmath10 ( @xmath11mev ) and @xmath2n ( ground state ) .",
    "the cross sections for these reactions are reasonably large , for neutrinos above the reaction thresholds of 14.4 , 15.1 , and @xmath12mev , respectively .",
    "this system is in many ways ideal for investigating neutrino physics since it offers charged - current and neutral - current neutrino reactions , allowing one to probe for potential neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "in addition , each of the above reactions has a distinguishing detection signature . in the case of the charged - current reactions ,",
    "the signature is the electron ( or positron ) emitted in the prompt reaction , followed tens of milliseconds later by the @xmath13 decay ( or @xmath14 decay ) back to @xmath2c  a delayed coincidence that enables identification of these specific interactions from background . for the neutral - current excitation of @xmath2c , the @xmath11mev gamma following",
    "de - excitation is the signature .    in a type ii supernova ,",
    "neutrinos are emitted with a thermal spectrum .",
    "the average neutrino energy depends upon the species of neutrino , since decoupling in the neutrinosphere occurs at different temperatures for the different species .",
    "typical values for the average neutrino energies are  @xcite : @xmath15mev for @xmath16 , @xmath17mev for @xmath18 , and @xmath19mev for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "this energy hierarchy enhances the sensitivity of the neutrino - carbon reactions to non - standard neutrino physics .",
    "the @xmath20 s and @xmath21 s are more energetic than electron neutrinos .",
    "they dominate the neutral - current reaction @xmath24 with an estimated contribution of around 90% .",
    "this allows the @xmath2c @xmath11mev events to be closely identified with the `` heavy flavor '' species .",
    "additionally , since the average energy of the @xmath16 or @xmath18 from the supernova is at or below their charged - current reaction thresholds , the total number of these events will be small .",
    "this provides a pseudo - appearance opportunity for observing neutrino flavor oscillations .    in order to exploit these aspects for exploring non - standard neutrino physics",
    ", a liquid scintillator supernova neutrino detector needs to be able to cleanly detect the @xmath11mev @xmath25 ray from the neutral - current reaction .",
    "this implies that the detector requires a large volume to contain this energetic @xmath25 ray . additionally , good energy resolution is necessary for resolution of the peak produced by these events in the energy spectrum .",
    "the lvd and macro experiments are existing scintillator detectors , but their @xmath11mev @xmath25 ray capabilities are somewhat limited since they are both segmented detectors .",
    "borexino and kamland will have excellent efficiency for detecting and resolving the @xmath11mev signal , as they will both feature large , homogeneous volumes of liquid scintillator .    in this paper",
    ", we present calculations of the neutrino event rates in borexino for a hypothetical type ii supernova at a distance of @xmath0kpc , with a typical binding energy release of @xmath26ergs .",
    "we illustrate the neutral - current capability of borexino , via detection of the @xmath11mev @xmath25 ray .",
    "finally , we describe the capabilities of borexino for exploring supernova neutrino oscillations and setting stringent neutrino mass limits , based upon the delayed arrival of a heavy @xmath21 . despite being a much smaller detector , the neutrino mass limits to",
    "which borexino is sensitive are comparable to what might be achieved by super - kamiokande and sno , in the event of a galactic supernova .",
    "the borexino experiment  @xcite is under construction at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso underground facility , in italy .",
    "its main physics goal is the detection of the 0.86 mev @xmath16 from electron - capture decay of @xmath27be in the sun .",
    "the detector has a central volume containing @xmath28tons of liquid scintillator ( pseudocumene plus fluor ) , contained in a spherical nylon bag and viewed by 2,200 photomultiplier tubes .",
    "supernova neutrinos will interact in the liquid scintillator via electron scattering , inverse @xmath6 decay of the proton and reactions on @xmath2c . constructed as a low - background solar neutrino detector , borexino will be able to cleanly detect all of these supernova neutrino interactions , with the exception that the handful of electron scattering events have no clear distinguishing signature .",
    "we start by considering a stellar gravitational collapse releasing @xmath29ergs binding energy  @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 of this binding energy comes off in the form of neutrinos , most of which originate from @xmath31 pair production .",
    "only a small fraction ( a few percent ) of the neutrinos are produced in other processes , such as the neutronization during core collapse .    at core collapse temperatures and densities exceeding @xmath32 , matter is not transparent to neutrinos .",
    "scattering interactions thermalize the neutrinos though their mean free path remains large ; in effect , neutrinos become the energy transport agents in the collapsed stellar core .",
    "they emerge from the cooling core or `` neutrinosphere '' after they decouple .",
    "the temperature at the time of decoupling determines the energy distribution of the emitted neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos of @xmath33 and @xmath34 flavor decouple at higher temperature , since they interact in ordinary matter only via the neutral - current weak interaction , whereas charged - current scattering can occur for @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the neutrino decoupling takes place in neutron rich matter , which is less transparent to @xmath16 than @xmath18 .",
    "the temperature hierarchy is , then : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "each spectrum can be considered as a fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential  @xcite : @xmath39 with the following parameters : @xmath40    based upon equipartition , the prediction is that all of the neutrino species are produced in the cooling core with the same luminosity  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the number of @xmath16 s will be greater than @xmath41 and @xmath42 , since their average energy is lower .",
    "the expected event rates for each of the reactions in borexino were calculated by integrating the cross sections as functions of energy over the fermi - dirac spectra for the relevant neutrino species .",
    "the total number of neutrinos of each type was estimated by dividing the binding energy equally between the six @xmath43 or @xmath44 species , and then dividing by the average energy @xmath45 of each species .",

    "<S> we calculated the expected neutrino signal in borexino from a typical type ii supernova at a distance of @xmath0kpc . </S>",
    "<S> a burst of around 110 events would appear in borexino within a time interval of about @xmath0s . </S>",
    "<S> most of these events would come from the reaction channel @xmath1 , while about 30 events would be induced by the interaction of the supernova neutrino flux on @xmath2c in the liquid scintillator . </S>",
    "<S> borexino can clearly distinguish between the neutral - current excitations @xmath3 and the charged - current reactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , via their distinctive event signatures . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the charged - current to neutral - current neutrino event rates and their time profiles with respect to each other can provide a handle on supernova and non - standard neutrino physics ( mass and flavor oscillations ) .    </S>",
