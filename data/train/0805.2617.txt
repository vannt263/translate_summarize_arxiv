    "dark matter ( dm ) is understood to comprise @xmath8 of the material universe ( fukugita & peebles 2004 ) , in the form of massive halos around galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the density profile of a dark halo depends on the unknown nature of the dm and the way structure develops over cosmic time .",
    "galaxy halos may be modified significantly when gas associated with the disk of a galaxy cools and condenses during its formation .",
    "in contrast , clusters are so massive that the virial temperature of the gas ( typically , @xmath9 kev ) is too high for efficient cooling and hence the cluster potential reflects the dominant dm .",
    "models for the development of structure now rest on accurate measurements of the power spectrum of mass fluctuations , the cosmological density of dm , and the contribution of a cosmological constant , @xmath2 ( spergel et al . 2007 ;",
    "komatsu et al .",
    "this framework is the standard `` @xmath2cdm '' cosmological model , with the added simple assumptions that dm is collisionless , reacts only gravitationally , was never relativistic ( cold ) , and with initially gaussian - distributed density perturbations . in this context",
    ", detailed @xmath10-body simulations have established a clear prediction that cdm - dominated cluster halos should have relatively shallow , low - concentration mass profiles , where the logarithmic gradient flattens continuously toward the center with a central slope tending towards @xmath11 , interior to a characteristic radius , @xmath12 ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , nfw , hereafter ; bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; maccio et al 2006 ; hennawi et al .",
    "2007 ; neto et al . 2007 ; duffy et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this `` nfw '' profile is characterized by the ( total ) mass , @xmath13 , within the virial radius , @xmath14 , and by the concentration parameter , @xmath15 .",
    "interaction between clusters indicates dm is collisionless , in particular the `` bullet cluster''(markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ) - where shocked gas lies between two substantial galaxy clusters , implying these clusters passed through each other recently ( markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ) . here",
    "the weak lensing signal follows the bimodal distribution of member galaxies reflecting substantial dm associated with each cluster component ( clowe et al .",
    "2006 ) and that this dm is relatively collisionless like the galaxies .",
    "these observations disfavour the class of alternative gravity theories for which the lensing signal is expected to trace the dominant baryonic contribution of the gas ( clowe et al .",
    "other cases of interaction show that in general displacement of the gas relative to the dm is typically related to interaction ( jee et al .",
    "2006 ; okabe & umetsu 2008 ) .    for many clusters",
    "no obvious evidence of recent interaction is seen as the gas and member galaxies follow a symmetric , structureless distribution .",
    "measurements of the mass profiles of these relaxed clusters may help in understanding the nature of dm , preferably relying on gravitational lensing signals where model - dependent assumptions are not required .",
    "for a1689 , over 100 multiply - lensed images have been used to derive the inner mass profile ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2005a ) , with the outer profile determined from weak lensing ( broadhurst et al .",
    "together , the full profile has the predicted nfw form , but with a surprisingly high concentration when compared to the shallow profiles of the standard @xmath2cdm model ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2005b ; umetsu & broadhurst 2008 ) .",
    "furthermore , good consistency is also found between the lensing based mass profile and the x - ray and dynamical structure of this cluster in model independent analyses ( lemze et al .",
    "2007 ; lemze et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "a similar discrepancy is also indicated by lensing observations of other clusters e.g. , ms2137 - 23 ( gavazzi et al . 2003 ) and cl0024 + 16 ( kneib et al . 2003 ) .    here",
    "we examine a sample of relaxed , high - mass clusters , to test the distinctive prediction of @xmath2cdm , and to settle empirically whether the mass profile of a1689 is unusual . in section ",
    "1 we describe the data reduction in  3 we present the weak lensing analysis and the magnification profiles derived from background number counts and make comparison with the prediction of the @xmath2cdm ; in  4 we discuss our results and conclusions .",

    "we use either the r or i bands for our weak lensing measurements ( described below ",
    "3 ) for which the instrumental response , sky background and seeing conspire to provide the best images .",
    "all the available bands are used to define colours with which we separate cluster members from the background in order to minimise dilution of the weak lensing signal by unlensed objects .    the standard pipeline reduction software for suprime - cam ( yagi et al .",
    "2002 ) is applied for flat - fielding , instrumental distortion correction , differential refraction , psf matching , sky subtraction and stacking .",
    "photometric catalogs are constructed from stacked and matched images using sextractor ( bertin & arnaut 1996 ) .",
    "we select red galaxies with colours redder than the colour - magnitude sequence of cluster e / so galaxies .",
    "the sequence forms a well defined line due to the richness and relatively low redshifts of our clusters .",
    "these red galaxies are expected to lie in the background by virtue of k - corrections which are greater than for the red cluster sequence galaxies and convincingly demonstrated spectroscopically by rines & geller ( 2008 ) .",
    "we also include very blue galaxies falling far from the cluster sequence,@xmath41 , depending on the passbands available for each cluster ( listed in table 1 ) , to minimise cluster contamination ( see medzinski et al .",
    "typically the proportion of blue galaxies used is around 50% of the red background .",
    "in addition , we adopt a conservative magnitude limit of @xmath42 , depending on the depth of the data for each cluster , to avoid incompleteness . imposing these strict limits",
    "is a necessary precaution against the diluting effect that unlensed cluster and foreground galaxies will otherwise produce , leading to spuriously shallow central mass profiles , as shown in broadhurst et al .",
    "2005b and medezinski et al .",
    "these data permit high quality weak lensing measurements , following established methods required to deal with instrumental and atmospheric effects following the formalism outlined in kaiser , squires , & broadhurst ( 1995 ) , with modifications described in erben et al .",
    "the mean residual stellar ellipticity after psf correction is less than , @xmath43 , in all fields , averaged over 400 - 600 stars and consistent with the standard error on this measurement , @xmath44 .",
    "note also the lack of any systematic deviation from zero in the b - mode , @xmath45 , shown in figure 2a .",
    "full details of the methods are presented in umetsu & broadhurst ( 2008 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the gravitational shear field by locally averaging the corrected distortions of colour - selected background galaxies of each cluster .",
    "this is compared to the distribution of color - selected cluster sequence galaxies . in each case , one large symmetric cluster is visible around which the lensing distortion pattern is clearly tangential , with little significant substructure .",
    "the derived radial profiles of the lensing distortion are seen to be very similar in form ( left panel of figure 2 ) , with differing amplitudes reflecting a range of mass .",
    "the nfw profile fits well each cluster ( figure 2 ; table 1 ) , but surprisingly the derived concentrations lie well in excess of the standard @xmath2cdm model ( figure 3 ) . for",

    "our measurements also imply a370 is the most massive cluster now known , @xmath50 , with a virial mass twice that of rxj1347 - 11 , the most x - ray luminous cluster known .",
    "our estimate of the virial mass of rxj1347 - 11 is in very good agreement with independent x - ray and lensing analyses ( miranda et al .",
    "2007 , kling et al . 2005 ) . for a1689",
    ", a somewhat lower concentration parameter is derived by limousin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , @xmath51 , from independent weak lensing measurements , which is consistent with our findings at the @xmath52 level , whereas the observed einstein radius of approximately 52is under - predicted by the nfw parameters obtained by limousin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , @xmath53 ( see umetsu & broadhurst 2008 ) .",
    "note , when model fitting an estimate of the background depth is required .",
    "the mean depth is sufficient for our purposes as the variation of the lens distance ratio , @xmath54 , is slow for our sample because the clusters are at relatively low redshift compared to the redshift range of the background galaxies .",
    "the estimated mean depth of the combined red+blue background galaxies is listed in column 5 , which we obtain by applying our colour - magnitude selection to subaru imaging of the hdf region ( capak et al .",
    "2004 ) , where photometric redshifts are reliable for red galaxies , with a mean redshift close to @xmath55 depending on the details of the colour magnitude selection .",
    "for the blue galaxies we may rely on the zcosmos deep redshift survey ( lilly et al .",
    "2008 ) where our mean depth is typically @xmath56 .",
    "lensing measures projected mass and so a statistical bias arises from the triaxiality of clusters in cases where the major axis lies along the line - of - sight .",
    "this leads to an @xmath57 increase in the mean value of lensing derived concentrations based on @xmath2cdm ( oguri et al .",
    "2005 ; hennawi et al . 2007 ) , and an overall discrepancy in @xmath58 of @xmath59 with respect to the predictions . a larger bias is inferred for clusters selected by the presence of large arcs , @xmath60 , representing the most triaxial cases ( hennawi et al .",
    "our sample is defined by the quality of available imaging and includes clusters observed for reasons other than lensing , hence it is unlikely that these clusters are all particularly triaxial with the long axes pointing to the observer .",
    "even so , applying the maximum estimated bias ( @xmath61 , oguri & blandford 2008 ) can not account for our measurements ( figure 3 ) .",
    "multiply - lensed images are visible in all our clusters , from which the inner mass distribution may be determined ( broadhurst et al . 2005a ; halkola et al . 2008 ; hennawi et al . 2008 ) and an equivalent einstein radius derived by averaging azimuthally ( figure 2 ) which for most cases is close to the observed radius . for a1703 and a370 , the tangential critical curves are significantly elongated , for @xmath62 ( limousin et al . 2008 ; kneib et al . 1993 ) although in general the mass distribution is always less elliptical than the critical curve .",
    "x - ray observations of a370 show the inner region has some substructure ( eg .",
    "shu etal 2008 ) , but beyond @xmath63 the weak lensing pattern and the distribution of galaxies is symmetrical , as seen in figure 1 . for each cluster",
    "the nfw parameters derived with or without the einstein radius constraint are found to be closely consistent and in combination they are more precisely determined - see table 1 .",
    "we also examine the magnification profile , @xmath64 , via the surface number density of background galaxies ( broadhurst , taylor , & peacock 1995 ) . at faint fluxes where the counts follow a power - law slope , @xmath65",
    ", lensing modifies the true density above the magnitude limit , @xmath66 , by , @xmath67 , implying competition between the magnified sky , which reduces the surface density , and an increase of galaxies magnified above the flux limit .",
    "here we use only galaxies lying redward of the cluster sequence because for these the intrinsic count - slope of faint red galaxies is relatively flat , @xmath68 , so a net count depletion results , which we readily detect for each cluster , increasing towards the center ( figure 2 ) . for each cluster",
    "we calculate the depletion of the counts expected for the the best fitting nfw profile derived from the corresponding distortion measurements above ( figure 2 , right panel , with same colour code ) , finding clear consistency , which considerably strengthens our conclusions , and also establishes the utility of the background red galaxies for measuring magnification .",
    "the variation in the total number of background counts seen in figure 2 simply reflects the relative depth of the imaging data and also to some extent the redshift of the cluster , which lies redder in colour space with increasing cluster redshift , thereby reducing the numbers of background galaxies which can be selected to lie redward of the sequence for our purposes .",
    "note , absolute counts are not used here , the models are instead normalised to the observed density when comparing with the model to avoid reliance on control fields .",
    "we have shown that the mass distribution of a sample of the most massive clusters follow a very similar form in terms of the observed lensing based profiles .",
    "the distortion profiles measured are amongst the most accurate constructed to date and the great depth of the subaru imaging permits magnification profiles to be established with unprecedented detail using the background red galaxy counts .",
    "the magnification and distortion profiles are fitted well by the general nfw profile for cdm dominated halos , which continuously steepens with radius , but the profiles derived are more concentrated than predicted by @xmath2cdm based simulations for which clusters of @xmath69 , form late ( @xmath7 ) with low concentrations , reflecting the low mean cosmological mass density today .",
    "tension with the standard @xmath2cdm model is also indicated by the observed einstein radii of very massive clusters , including those studied here , which lie well beyond the predicted range derived from massive halos generated in @xmath2cdm based simulations ( broadhurst & barkana 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , a significant discrepancy is also claimed for x - ray derived cluster concentrations , with respect to the @xmath2cdm based on wmap5 parameters ( duffy et al .",
    "the combined x - ray and lensing based concentrations compiled by comerford and natarajan ( 2008 ) also exceeds somewhat the standard expectation , despite including x - ray based concentrations that are found to be systematically lower than for lensing ( comerford and natarajan 2008 ) .",
    "the mass - concentration relation of mandelbaum etal ( 2008 ) is claimed to be more consistent with @xmath2cdm .",
    "here allowance is made for the smoothing of the central lensing signal when stacking many sdss clusters , relying on the brightest cluster galaxy to define the center of mass .",
    "cluster members misclassified as background galaxies when estimating photometric redshifts will also act to reduce the derived concentrations , diluting the central lensing signal .    without resorting to radical proposals regarding the nature of dm ,",
    "our findings imply the central region of clusters collapsed earlier than expected . assuming the simple redshift relation @xmath70 ( e.g. , wechsler et al .",
    "2006 ) , relating central cluster densities to the cosmological mean density , then the formation of clusters with @xmath71 corresponds to @xmath72 , significantly earlier than in the standard @xmath2cdm , for which clusters form today with @xmath73 .",
    "the presence of massive clusters at high redshift ( @xmath74 ) , and the old ages of their member galaxies ( zirm et al . 2008 ; blakeslee et al .",
    "2003 ) , may also imply clusters collapsed at relatively early times(mathis , diego , & silk 2004 ) , for which accelerated growth factors have been proposed , adopting a generalised equation of state ( sadeh & rephaeli 2008 ) .",
    "alternatively , since clusters correspond to rare density maxima , then any non - gaussianity in the early fluctuation spectrum may advance cluster formation ( matthis , diego , & silk 2004 ; sadeh , rephaeli , & silk 2007 ) .",
    "our results present a challenge to some of these models , since earlier cluster formation must not also enhance significantly the abundance of clusters .",
