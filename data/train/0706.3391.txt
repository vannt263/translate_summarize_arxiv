    "a number of studies have noted that there are more spheroid stars in the virgo constellation than were expected from smooth spatial models of the spheroid star density .",
    "the first indication of spheroid substructure in this region of the sky came from the @xcite discovery of five excess rr lyrae stars from quasar equatorial survey team ( quest ) survey data .",
    "although a small number , it was a significant overdensity in a small area .",
    "the quest collaboration later identified an excess of 23 rr lyrae variables with this clump .",
    "these rr lyrae stars have apparent magnitudes @xmath3 , and are within the galactic coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the collaboration later dubbed this feature the ",
    "@xmath6 clump \" @xcite .",
    "subsequent spectra of the rr lyraes and bhb stars in this clump @xcite revealed a moving group at ( ra , dec ) @xmath7 with a line - of - sight , galactic standard of rest velocity of @xmath8 and a distance of 19 kpc from the sun .",
    "they suggest that this moving group be called the virgo stellar stream ( vss ) .",
    "the existence of an overdensity of stars in the stellar spheroid near @xmath9 was independently confirmed by @xcite using measurements of blue turnoff stars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , and identified as s297 + 63 - 20.5 . turnoff . in the present paper",
    "we correct the name to be s297 + 63 - 20.5 ; both names will refer to the same overdensity of stars . ]",
    "the estimated distance of this structure from the sun , calculated from @xmath10 turnoff stars , is @xmath11 kpc , but the color - magnitude diagram of this region does not have a tight main sequence , indicating that the structure is likely to be dispersed in distance .",
    "this overdensity appears to match the position of the  @xmath6 clump \" , but is somewhat offset from the vss , which is at @xmath12 .    because the mapping between the physical structure on the sky and its nomenclature in the literature for the apparent excess in the number of spheroid stars in the virgo constellation is unclear , we will refrain for now from identifying the s297 + 63 - 20.5 stars with the vss , though they are at about the same distance and position in the sky .",
    "we will return to the question of which named spheroid structures are related to each other in the discussion section of this paper .",
    "@xcite also identify a structure in virgo using the stellar catalogs from the 2mass survey , and connect it to  m giants tens of kiloparsecs above the galactic plane that are in the heart of the descending , foreshortened northern loop , \" which is their terminology for the leading tidal tail of the sgr dwarf galaxy .",
    "any overdensity in this part of the sky is close to the orbital plane of the sgr dwarf galaxy , and might be related to the sgr dwarf tidal debris .",
    "later papers , for example @xcite , show both the leading and trailing tidal tails of the sgr dwarf looping around through a similar position on the sky , near the identified overdensities in virgo , before passing through the galactic plane very close to the sun . since the sagittarius tidal tails are quite prominent in the spheroid , and the observed overdensity or overdensities in the virgo region are near the orbital plane of the sagittarius dwarf , a connection between these structures is worthy of exploration .    @xcite identify a large overdensity ( the virgo overdensity , vod ) in the virgo constellation , which may or may not be related to the previously named substructures . using photometric parallaxes for a large number of sdss stars , they show that this large overdensity is @xmath13 kpc above the plane and covers @xmath14 sq . deg . of sky .",
    "they detect no downturn in the star counts toward lower galactic latitudes , indicating that the structure could continue further into the galactic plane than the sdss observations probe . at that time",
    "the sdss had not yet probed galactic latitudes lower than about @xmath15 near @xmath16 . @xcite",
    "interpret the overdensity as a significant spheroid substructure that might be an invading dwarf galaxy .",
    "the estimated distance to the vod is smaller than the distance to the vss or s297 + 63 - 20.5 .",
    "it is unclear whether the nearer distance is real , or if distance uncertainties are large enough that the vod , vss , and s297 + 63 - 20.5 could describe the same physical structure . in",
    " 2 and  3 of this paper we will discuss s297 + 63 - 20.5 only ; the relationship of this overdensity to the vod and vss will be deferred to the discussion .",
    "more recently , @xcite suggest that the invading dwarf galaxy might be the sgr dwarf galaxy leading tidal tail , and show that the @xcite model passes through the observed location of the vod , and that the stellar density of the vod is similar to the model predictions .",
    "they suggest that if the sgr dwarf tidal stream passes through the solar neighborhood , it will be detected as an excess of stars with negative radial velocities in the northern galactic hemisphere .",
    "this paper treats the vod as a separate entity from the vss , but located in a similar position in space .",
    "the vod is described by these authors as likely to be associated with the sgr leading arm , and therefore infalling , and the vss is a group of stars nearly coincident in sky position , but with a different vertical and kinematic structure .    because the sgr dwarf galaxy tidal tails can help constrain the shape of gravitational potential of the milky way and its dark matter halo , they are the topic of considerable study , independent from their possible connection with the observed overdensity in virgo .",
    "one can in principle , by building ever more sophisticated equipment , know the position and velocity of every star in the milky way .",
    "stars in tidal streams are the only stars which one can even in principle know about their positions and velocities in the past .",
    "stars in tidal streams all resided , at one time in the past , in the progenitor satellite dwarf galaxy or star cluster .",
    "it is this property of tidal streams that allows us to use them to constrain the milky way potential .    because the sgr dwarf tidal tails are the most prominent tidal debris in the spheroid , and because the sgr dwarf orbital plane is approximately perpendicular to the galactic plane",
    ", observations of the sgr tidal debris potentially provide a strong indication of the shape of the gravitational potential surrounding the milky way .",
    "interestingly , a comparison of disruption models with stellar positions and velocities in the sgr tidal tails has produced a contradictory result .",
    "the leading and trailing sgr tidal tails do not lie on the same plane @xcite ; they are tilted in opposite directions with respect to the orbital plane of the sgr dwarf galaxy .",
    "their tilt suggests that the galactic potential is oblate @xcite .",
    "however , the radial velocities of what appear to be some leading tidal tail stars can only be fit to disruption models with prolate galactic potentials @xcite .",
    "the leading tidal tail stars that are not compatible with oblate galactic potentials are near the various identified substructures in virgo .",
    "one must consider the possibility that the milky way potential is more complex than the models , or that some sgr leading tidal tail stars might be misidentified .",
    "@xcite seems to suggest the latter .",
    "figure 3 of their paper shows radial velocities for leading tidal tail debris that has @xmath17 measurements like those of an oblate dark matter halo , and stars with @xmath18 km s@xmath19 that they interpret as arising from an ancient episode of tidal stripping .",
    "@xcite , however , show the leading tidal stream from sgr transitioning seamlessly into a clump of stars with @xmath20 km s@xmath19 .",
    "it is this latter clump of sgr leading tidal tail stars that can only be fit with a prolate halo model .",
    "the data in both papers come from 2mass selected m giants , and the velocity dispersions of the stars in the vicinity of the virgo constellation , with @xmath20 km s@xmath19 , are much larger than other places along the tidal debris stream .",
    "another complication that potentially blurs our understanding of the nature and extent of the overdensity ( or overdensities ) in virgo is the suggestion that the smooth population of stars in the spheroid might be triaxial @xcite .",
    "a triaxial spheroid can produce a stellar density that is not symmetric around the center of the galaxy , as viewed from our vantage point near the sun .",
    "this idea was proposed because several authors see more spheroid stars in quadrant iv ( @xmath21 ) than we see in quadrant i ( @xmath22 ) , and because the lowest density of spheroid stars appears to be at a galactic longitude slightly less than @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "a triaxial spheroid might explain how an overdensity could cover a large region of the sky and not immediately disperse ; the overdensity in virgo might be partially composed of an increased density of spheroid stars from the smooth component .",
    "figure 3 of @xcite shows that no model has been found that completely accounts for the observed overdensity of stars near s297 + 63 - 20.5 , so although a triaxial spheroid might fit the tails of an overdensity in virgo , we would still expect to find a more spatially concentrated component of tidal debris with coherent velocities .    a key distinction between explaining an asymmetry with a ` local ' stream vs. a ` global ' structure such as a triaxial spheroid is the difference in observed velocity dispersion of member stars .",
    "stars in a stream must have a relatively small velocity dispersion ( @xmath24 ) , given the origin of the stream and given the fact that stream remains coherent as it moves through the galaxy s potential .",
    "on the other hand , a triaxial spheroid structure in the halo may have a very large velocity dispersion ( @xmath25 ) , but evidence for its member stars will be spread around the whole of the halo .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to disentangle the components of the spheroid substructure in virgo using sdss photometry of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) and f turnoff stars to build density maps of the tidal streams and the stellar spheroid itself .",
    "we show that the sgr dwarf leading tidal tail , which is in the north galactic cap , arcs over ( farther from the galactic plane ) the s297 + 63 - 20.5 overdensity , and over the position of the sun in the galactic plane .",
    "if one extrapolates the path of the sgr leading tidal tail below @xmath26 , it passes through the galactic plane 15 kpc or more outside the solar circle .",
    "this calls into question both the identification of s297 + 63 - 20.5 stars with the sgr leading tidal tail and the identity of the m giant stars identified with the leading tidal tail of sagittarius that have velocities in conflict with oblate models of the galactic potential .",
    "we show that there is a clear peak in the density of @xmath27 f turnoff stars near @xmath28 that is at least @xmath29 across , but the total extent on the sky and distance range can not be constrained by photometry alone .",
    "the densities of f turnoff stars over a four magnitude range ( @xmath30 ) are not consistent with an axisymmetric spheroid .",
    "if the absolute magnitude range of the f turnoff stars is 1.5 magnitudes , the spread in distance is a factor of 3 , or in this case 10 - 32 kpc . in every direction that we probe at these implied distances ,",
    "there are more stars in quadrants iii & iv than there are in the symmetric position ( with the same galactic latitude but with longitude @xmath31 ) in quadrants ii & i. if the spheroid is axisymmetric , then the number counts should differ only where there is a significant tidal substructure .",
    "either there is an enormous substructure centered in virgo but covering a large fraction of the galaxy or the smooth portion of the spheroid is not axisymmetric .",
    "we then measure the velocities of the f turnoff stars associated with s297 + 63 - 20.5 and find that their line - of - sight , galactic center of rest velocity is @xmath32 . throughout this paper ,",
    "the symbol @xmath17 will refer to the line - of - sight component of the velocity , as determined from radial velocity , transformed to the galactic standard of rest , using a solar motion of @xmath33 km s@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath17 is not consistent with the leading tidal tail of sgr , which has negative @xmath17 , in support of our claim that s297 + 63 - 20.5 is not spatially coincident with the sgr stream .",
    "this velocity is significantly higher than the measured @xmath17 for the vss , but not so different that the two structures could not be related in some way .    in the direction @xmath34",
    ", we see evidence for peaks with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the first of the two peaks appears to have a bluer turnoff than the latter peak , and could potentially be related to the 2mass m giant stars that have previously been assigned to the sgr leading tidal tail .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that both the leading and trailing tails of the sgr dwarf spheroidal galaxy can be traced in sdss color - selected bhb and f turnoff stars . since this work ,",
    "much more sdss data have become available , covering nearly the entire north galactic cap .",
    "we will use the bhb and f turnoff stars in these data to trace the sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal tails , and explore their connection with the s297 + 63 - 20.5 overdensity in virgo .",
    "the data presented in this paper come from the sdss dr5 @xcite plus about 200 square degrees of imaging data from sdss ii that fills in the gap in dr5 photometry near the galactic pole ( to be released as part of sdss - ii dr6 ) .",
    "we will be analyzing @xmath37 photometry @xcite of 8500 sq .",

    "other sdss technical information can be found in : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars are important for tracing spheroid structure because they are intrinsically bright and because they are all approximately the same absolute magnitude so their distances can be estimated from apparent magnitudes to create a three dimensional picture of the spheroid .",
    "bhb stars are typically found in older stellar populations such as are found in the spheroid , but are not found in all old populations . even in the spheroid , there are a significant number of high surface gravity stars with colors that suggest a spectral type of a. these stars are either blue stragglers or young stars that have been stripped from a star - forming region such as a dwarf galaxy , and are approximately two magnitudes fainter than bhb stars . from sdss",
    "photometry we can select stars with colors consistent with spectral type a , and then we further divide this sample into the stars whose photometry is more consistent with high surface gravity and the stars whose photometry is more consistent with a bhb star .",
    "the photometric separation of a stars by surface gravity is not perfect , but is good enough to reveal important spheroid substructures .",
    "photometrically selected a - colored stars were chosen from the sdss database in a similar manner to @xcite .",

    "the leading tidal tail appears unexpectedly broad in this projection as it arcs over the sun , and the extrapolation of the leading tidal tail toward the galactic plane is somewhat ambiguous .    since viewing the data in the observed ( magnitude ) rather the derived ( distance ) space often yields higher contrast on any structures present in the halo , we show in figure [ glambda ] the @xmath46 magnitude vs. @xmath47 angular position along the sgr tidal stream , separately for bhb and bs stars within 15 kpc of the sgr dwarf orbital plane .",

    "since the leading tidal tail arcs past this angle , it likely passes through the galactic plane outside the solar circle .",
    "since there are many more f turnoff stars in any stellar population than there are bhb stars , these f stars are in principle better tracers of substructure .",
    "the disadvantages of using f turnoff stars is that they are 3 or 4 magnitudes fainter than the horizontal branch , and have a broader spread in absolute magnitude ( so they are less accurate distance indicators ) .",

    "the mean velocity in the galactic rest frame of these stars is 99.8 km s@xmath19 .",
    "additional stars as close as 16 kpc and as distant as 24 kpc have similar enough radial velocities that they might be considered to be part of the same kinematic structure .",
    "the remaining stars are not consistent with a gaussian distribution , and we note that there is a very significant peak in the lower panel of their figure 2 that is very near @xmath173 . if one considers all of the radial velocities obtained by @xcite , there are 12 stars in a peak at nearly 100 km s@xmath19 , nine stars in a peak at @xmath174 km s@xmath19 , and 7 stars with very large negative or positive radial velocities that are consistent with neither peak , nor with any existing model of spheroid kinematics .",
    "there is insufficient information in the @xcite paper to adequately analyze the nine stars with velocities toward the sun , but they likely cover an area @xmath29 on the sky or larger , and at least the distance range @xmath175 kpc .",
    "these stars are very likely associated with our f turnoff star peak at @xmath169 and with the stars that @xcite assigns to the sgr leading tidal tail .",
    "figure 3 of @xcite also show stars in the same part of the sky , @xmath176 , and with similar velocities , @xmath177 km s@xmath19 .",
    "interestingly , they identify these stars as part of an ancient tidal debris stream that was stripped from sgr @xmath178 gyr ago . although this presents a possible explanation , it does not explain why the dispersion of the stars appears so large in this portion of the sky , and is at odds with the general assumption that 2mass giants favor younger , more recently stripped portions of the debris .",
    "figure 12 of @xcite shows a subset of stars in this region that have a very narrow velocity dispersion and very nearly match the expected position of the ancient tidal debris if one assumes an oblate dark matter halo . one wonders whether a simpler explanation for the debris with @xmath20 km s@xmath19 might be the presence of a previously unidentified spheroid component .",
    "the fact that the stars in this infalling structure have a blue turnoff supports , but does not prove , the claim that they are part of the sgr dwarf tidal stream .",
    "however , they appear to be closer than the main part of the tidal tail . further investigation is required to determine whether they are part of the sgr dwarf tidal debris , and whether they represent the population of stars they are being compared to in the tidal disruption models .",
    "if we knew the spatial position of every spheroid star , or at least a representative sample of spheroid stars , we could use this information to construct a density model for this milky way component . but",
    "given that there are very large known overdensities in the spheroid , what would the parameters in this model be ?",
    "@xcite show that all smooth models are poor fits to the distribution of stars in the spheroid .",
    "we have chosen to model the spheroid as a set of significant overdensities that are coherent in position and velocity , plus a roughly smooth spheroid distribution .",
    "overdensities include globular clusters , dwarf galaxies , and large chunks of associated debris from these objects .",
    "thus , we are now in the process of identifying large , coherent debris structures so that we can fit the remaining stars to a smooth spheroid model ; and fitting smooth spheroid models so we can identify overdensities that might be large , coherent debris structures .",
    "there is no controversy over the asymmetry of the star counts in the stellar spheroid stars in the north galactic cap @xcite , though there is a question of whether there is an asymmetry in the south @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether the asymmetry is due to a single large debris structure added to an otherwise axisymmetric distribution of stars .",
    "the data in this paper suggest that is not the case .",
    "the s297 + 63 - 20.5 is a very significant , coherent overdensity that contains about half the spheroid stars at @xmath93 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , we have shown that it is localized in magnitude and velocity , and does not explain the asymmetry at brighter magnitudes .",
    "it is possible that there is more than one structure , or maybe a set of structures , that conspire to make the north galactic cap appear asymmetric .",
    "it seems at least as likely that the spheroid itself is not symmetric about an axis through the center of the milky way and perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "we have shown that our existing triaxial spheroid model is not perfect , but goes some way toward predicting the number of spheroid stars in the observations .",
    "we hope the model will improve as more large , coherent spheroid substructures are identified and as our fitting procedures evolve .",
    "the sgr leading tidal tail is traced through the north galactic cap over the center of the milky way , over s297 + 63 - 20.5 , over the sun , and at @xmath26 it is heading toward the galactic plane at a galactic longitude of @xmath92 .",
    "we expect that it pierces the galactic plane well outside the solar circle .",
    "we question whether some of the m giant stars that have been compared to sgr dwarf disruption models are at the right distance to be members of the sgr dwarf leading tidal tail .",
    "the main part of the sgr dwarf leading tidal tail is not spatially coincident with the s297 + 63 - 20.5 overdensity in virgo .",
    "the stars in s297 + 63 - 20.5 have line - of - sight , galactic standard of rest velocities @xmath179 .",
    "the velocity dispersion is difficult to estimate because we do not know for sure which stars are part of the structure , but velocity dispersions of 10 @xmath180 to 30 @xmath181 are not unreasonable .",
    "since the sgr dwarf tidal tail would have negative velocities in this part of the sky , we determine that s297 + 63 - 20.5 is not associated with the leading tidal tail . because the color of the turnoff , the density structure , and the @xmath17 velocities do not match any known or expected sgr debris , we suggest that it is instead part of a distinct merger event .",
    "the virgo stellar stream ( vss , duffau et al . 2006 ) is at the same distance from the sun as s297 + 63 - 20.5 and has a similar but not identical position in the sky and in @xmath17 .",
    "it could be a the same as s297 + 63 - 20.5 or a structure within s297 + 63 - 20.5 , but the relationship is not certain .",
    "the virgo overdensity ( vod , juri et al . 2006 ) and s297 + 63 - 20.5 are in the same position in the sky and have a similar number of stars in excess of the smooth spheroid , but they are at a different distances from the sun .",
    "probably , there is a scale difference between our distance measurements and the vod is the same as s297 + 63 - 20.5 .",
    "we show that the number densities of f turnoff stars are not symmetric about the galactic center at @xmath182 , and that this discrepancy is not due to s297 + 63 - 20.5 . either the spheroid is asymmetric about the galactic center , or there are additional substructures that conspire to be on the same side of the galaxy as s297 + 63 - 20.5 .",
    "finally , we note that in every figure showing the spatial and velocity distribution in the spheroid , there are hints of extra unidentified substructure . in particular , we note an unexplained overdensity of bhb stars at @xmath183 , and two additional moving groups near s297 + 63 - 20.5 with velocities @xmath184 and @xmath35 .",
