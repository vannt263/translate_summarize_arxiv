    "the pattern by which disks fade over their first @xmath0 100 myr provides clues to these processes , including dispersal by viscous accretion and photoevaporation , loss of dust grains by photon pressure and poynting - robertson drag , and through the consequences of the formation and migration of planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    over this entire time span",
    ", disks are marked by strong optical scattering and infrared and submillimeter emission by dust , which arises from primordial dust in the protoplanetary disks that are prominent for the first @xmath0 5 - 10 myr , and from second generation dust in the debris disks that come to the fore later .",
    "different disk zones and particle sizes are probed in these dusty disks at different wavelengths , e.g. , in optically thin ( debris ) disks sub-@xmath4 particles are most efficient at scattering , and small particles in the inner disk are also dominant in the near - infrared emission , while the far infrared reveals disk components at tens of au from their stars , and the submm is the realm of larger grains that mark the positions of the parent bodies whose collisions yield the dust seen at shorter wavelengths . imaging in the optical with _",

    "* ) has mapped disks in scattered light .",
    "infrared observations with iras , iso , wise , _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , and in the brightest cases from the ground , have made substantial contributions to our understanding of disk evolution as seen in the emitting dust .",
    "millimeter - wave facilities such as scuba , sma , and alma have provided insights to the location of the parent bodies from which the grains seen at shorter wavelengths are generated .    a critical parameter to characterize disk dissipation and planet formation is the time evolution of these various disk components .",
    "statistical studies , mostly in the wavebands from 2 @xmath4 to 8 @xmath4 , have constrained the dissipation timescale of the inner zones of protoplanetary disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "starting with the pioneering study by @xcite , all of this work has converged on the conclusion that the fraction of disks above a given detection threshold decays exponentially with a decay timescale of @xmath0 3 myr .",
    "the 10 @xmath4 observations , though with poorer statistics , are consistent with this timescale @xcite . a similar timescale is deduced for the outermost disk regions from the general absence of sub - mm emission from systems that do not also have near infrared excesses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the disk lifetime for higher mass stars is even shorter @xcite .",
    "it has been assumed that disk dissipation in the giant planet forming zones that dominate disk emission between 20 and 40 @xmath5 m follows a similar timeline @xcite .",
    "this is a demanding constraint on theories of giant planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the physical evolution in this region could well differ from that in the regions that dominate at shorter and longer wavelengths .",
    "models of viscous accretion and photoevaporation predict that the mid - disk region , roughly coincident with the range for giant planet formation , should be the slowest to dissipate @xcite . after the primordial disks have faded",
    ", the growth of oligarchics and their subsequent merger into terrestrial planets should also produce copious dust in dense debris disks .",
    "the best available means to explore these processes is the sensitive measurements at 22 and 24 @xmath5 m with wise and _",
    "spitzer_. however , such studies have been hampered by the need to extend them to relatively distant clusters and associations where the measurements do not reach the photospheres of most of the target stars .",
    "the most ambitious effort @xcite assumes an exponential decay at 22 - 24 @xmath4 as has been found at the shorter wavelengths , but the uncertainties in the fitting parameters are large and the possibility of a different decay behavior is not excluded .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that an exponential decay similar to that at shorter wavelengths is followed by a second peak in disk incidence , attributed to the development of massive debris disks , whereas @xcite fit the behavior with a single exponential with a longer time constant than applies at the shorter wavelengths .    in this paper",
    ", we explore disk evolution at 24 @xmath4 , introducing three innovations to improve on previous studies : 1 . )",
    "we introduce a digital filtering approach to eliminate from the study stars with potentially contaminated 24 @xmath5 m data ; 2 . )",
    "we use a statistical method to constrain the number of faint sources below the detection limit for individual objects as a way to mitigate the inability of _ spitzer _ to probe enough clusters to the deep limits desired ; and 3 . )",
    "we use the behavior of transitional disks , the final stage of evolution of protoplanetary disks prior to their dissipation , as an additional constraint on disk behavior .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our sample and age estimates .",
    "appendices a and b provide more details on the clusters and associations from which we have drawn samples of stars for the study .",
    "section 3 introduces the 24 @xmath5 m data reduction and matching of infrared sources to cluster members .",
    "this section also introduces the digital filtering approach , which is described in more detail in appendix c. in section 4 , we discuss the 24 @xmath5 m excesses associated with disks and their time evolution , including use of statistical methods to extend the treatment to levels of disk emission below the individual - source detection limit . in this section ,",
    "we also introduce the use of the transitional disk evolution as an additional constraint on the overall decay of disk incidence , requiring this decay to be non - exponential .",
    "section 5 expands on these results , showing how the decay of 24 @xmath5 m excesses is consistent with theoretical models of dissipation in the giant - planet - forming zones , and that there is a longer - lasting population of prominent disks possibly associated with giant collisions in the olligarchic / chaotic phase of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "section 6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "for our study , we first identified young clusters and associations with a significant number of members and high - quality _ spitzer _ observations . at the older ages , we supplemented this list with a small number of cases where wise data have adequate sensitivity .",
    "we proceeded to analyze only those clusters where high - quality membership lists were available from the literature , as discussed individually in appendix  a. in the case of ngc 2244 , we assembled existing material into a comprehensive membership list for this work ( see appendix  b ) .    our results would be undermined if the memberships had a significant number of stars with incorrectly identified infrared excesses .",
    "therefore , we applied a digital filter to identify and eliminate cluster members on complex backgrounds that would significantly reduce the accuracy of the 24 @xmath5 m photometry ( and potentially yield false excesses at this wavelength ) .",
    "our approach is similar to a selection method used previously on the basis of root median square deviation by e.g. , @xcite , with some additional criteria .      a recent revision of age estimates ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has resulted in larger values for most stars younger than 15 myr than had been derived previously .",
    "we will distinguish this revised age scale from the traditional one .",
    "for ages @xmath6 15 myr , there is general agreement on ages as based on lithium absorption @xcite .",
    "we discuss the age estimates for each cluster / association in appendix a. to obtain a homogeneous set of traditional ages , we gave priority to those listed in the review by eric mamajek @xcite .",
    "when necessary , we have assigned ages on the revised scale according to similarity in published hr diagrams with clusters / associations with directly determined ages .",
    "the two scales place the clusters / associations in a similar order but differ by up to a factor of two in the absolute values .",
    "we carry out our analysis on both scales to demonstrate that our conclusions are independent of which is used .",
    "an inherent issue with studies of stellar clusters is the large range of distances and the resulting range of detection limits when converted , e.g. , to stellar mass . the stellar clusters / assocations in this work span nearly two orders of magnitude in distance , from nearby moving groups with member stars within 20 pc to the farthest cluster at 1.5 kpc .",
    "two types of  limits \" are relevant in considering the effective range of our disk census . given the membership list of a cluster or an association , first , we have a completeness in stellar mass , @xmath7 , above which all member stars are likely already identified and included in the list . to determine the completeness limits of the photometry , we constructed luminosity functions in terms of the irac 3.6 @xmath4 magnitudes and estimated the limits as the magnitude where the functions turn over .",
    "converted to masses , the limits are @xmath00.5 m@xmath8 at 300 pc and @xmath9 1 m@xmath8 at 1.3 kpc . because of the shallow dependence of absolute k ( and irac ) magnitude on stellar mass , the resulting range in @xmath7 is modest and the trend nearly monotonically depends on cluster distance .",
    "second , depending on the distance and the depth of the mips image , there is a mass limit for each cluster to which the 24 @xmath5 m measurements can detect stellar photospheres , @xmath10 .",
    "although this mass is sometimes taken to limit 24 @xmath5 m disk detections , studies focussing on large excesses are limited at a somewhat lower mass limit so long as @xmath7 @xmath11 @xmath10 .",
    "that is , in this case all of the disks can be detected to a lower mass limit than applies to the photospheres alone . in section 4.1 , we introduce a new method to estimate , on a statistical basis , the disk brightnesses around member stars that are not individually detected at 24 @xmath4 . with the new method",
    ", we can extend the mass limit for disk detection at our adopted excess level down to @xmath0 1.2 @xmath12 even in the least favorable clusters , e.g. , ngc 1960 .",
    "for jhk and irac bands 1 - 4 , we used publicly available / published measurements . however , we utilized approaches at 24 @xmath5 m that required high quality new reductions .",
    "we re - measured mips 24 @xmath5 m photometry for all the clusters except for a few noted in appendix a. we obtained the 24 @xmath5 m data from the _ spitzer _ heritage archive as summarized in table 1 . to extract the best possible photometric precision , throughout this work",
    ", we use only the mosaic images prepared by the mips data analysis tool @xcite with post - pipeline processing to improve the flat fielding and to remove instrumental artifacts @xcite .",
    "the pixel scale in the final mosaics is 1.245  pixel@xmath13 .",
    "this improved pipeline and calibration procedure produces high - quality mosaics with uniform photometric properties ; the rms systematic photometric errors are well below 2% ( see appendix c.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the open cluster ic 348 was observed in 8 epochs to search for variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the depths of the images captured in each epoch are nearly identical . in this work",
    "we make measurements of stars on each image separately .",
    "the final photometry adopted is the average of all 8 measurements , and the error is their standard deviation .",
    "a fraction of sco - cen members were also observed in multiple epochs , where the same treatment is applied .    to associate 24 @xmath4 detections with those at shorter wavelengths , we start with the 2mass ( or [ 3.6 ] ) positions for the member stars ( whether the source is detected or not at 24 @xmath4 ) , and convert them to image coordinates based on the standard world coordinate system ( wcs ) pointing information in the mips image headers .",
    "the astrometric error is expected to be on the sub - arcsecond level in 2mass , and no worse than 1  in the mips images for stars with a high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio . in identifying detections , a tolerance of 1.6 pixels (= 2.0 )",
    "is allowed to accommodate the lower s / n for many sources .",
    "this matching radius was selected to include virtually all of the _ bona fide _ matches but to minimize contamination by background sources ; the study by @xcite demonstrates this performance .",
    "since the members are identified in the optical and near - infrared where stellar photospheres are brighter , many stars in the membership lists are not individually detected at 24 @xmath4 .",
    "the sources that are detected individually make up our `` primary sample '' .",
    "classical psf - fitting photometry was performed on the primary - sample cluster members with the daophot package in iraf . because the mips 24 @xmath5 m psf is very stable among data obtained at different times , instead of constructing a psf from real stars in the images , we use a smoothed stinytim simulated psf @xcite for all the photometry @xcite .",
    "we have found this procedure to give very accurate photometry .",
    "the psf fit was optimized within the 2  positional uncertainty . to avoid interference from nearby bright sources or nebulosity ,",
    "the psf fitting was confined within fixed apertures with aperture correction factors determined from the simulated psf . after some tests an aperture radius of four pixels ( 5@xmath14 ) was adopted for all clusters . to estimate the sky emission level under the psf",
    ", sky annuli were determined cluster by cluster depending on the overall complexity of their respective sky backgrounds . as a general strategy we used small sky annuli to avoid serious background interference ( see table 1 ) .",
    "for each cluster , stars with low fluxes at 24 @xmath4 were inspected to determine the detection limits at which a stellar psf became apparent in the images . since the youngest clusters often have nebulous sky background , these limits vary significantly depending on the local sky appearance , typically corresponding to a nominal s / n @xmath0 3 - 4 for areas with clear and stable background , and up to @xmath158 for clusters on very complicated background , like ic 348 .",
    "table  [ list ] lists the mips observations , as well as the photometric parameters used and the detection limits for each of the clusters .",
    "we consider stars with psf - fitted flux densities lower than these image detection limits as undetected .",
    "however , some stars on complicated sky background with low psf - fitting s / n ratios appear to have large measured flux densities in aperture photometry .",
    "the photometry in such areas is mostly unreliable , and is dealt with using a filtering process introduced in appendix  [ filter ] .",
    "this filtering is similar to that used by @xcite but with additional criteria to make it more selective .",
    "the basic idea of the filtering with both approaches is to eliminate the photometry on `` bad '' sky background .",
    "such a position - based process is expected only to scale down the population of our sample , but to introduce no selection effects in terms of the statistical properties of the stars .",
    "cluster members on clean background but not detected at 24 @xmath4 comprise our `` secondary sample . '' for them , we obtain aperture photometry at the 2mass positions with no recentering .",
    "negative flux densities are allowed , since they could be natural results of statistical noise for non - detections and of unfavorable positions with respect to local bright regions on sky background .",
    "our photometry is summarized in table 2 .      with",
    "the population of member stars ( filtered to remove cases likely to be contaminated by complex backgrounds ) , we can determine the fraction of cluster and association members with 24 @xmath4 excesses .",
    "we define `` relative excess '' , or the excess - to - photosphere flux ratio , as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the observed flux density , @xmath18 is that expected from the stellar photosphere , and @xmath19 is the deduced contribution from the disk .",
    "that is , @xmath20 is the 24 @xmath4 excess emission in units of photospheric brightness .",
    "such relative measurements have the important advantage that they are not a strong function of stellar mass , and thus have been widely used in previous studies of circumstellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the photospheric brightnesses at 24 @xmath4 are extrapolated from irac 3.6 @xmath4 photometry , except for the @xmath1 pic moving group ( bpmg ) and the three subassociations of sco - cen where the extrapolations are based on the 2mass @xmath21 photometry because it is more complete .",
    "we adopt 3.6 @xmath4 because data at longer wavelengths are more likely to have excess emission that is correlated to the 24 @xmath4 photometry and thus may not be indicative of the bare stellar photospheres , while the radiation at shorter wavelengths is likely to have suffered from more severe interstellar extinction that is nonuniform even within the same cluster .",
    "however , some young stars also have infrared excess at this wavelength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these 3.6 @xmath4 relative excesses are generally much smaller than their 24 @xmath4 counterparts , and mostly fade out in a few myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we treat the 3.6 @xmath4 photometry differently for clusters younger than and older than 6 myr old ( on the revised scale , corresponding to @xmath0 3 myr on the traditional one ) .",
    "we discuss these two cases next .",
    "we include six clusters / associations younger than 6 myr ( 3 myr on the traditional scale ) , where we need to take account of possible excesses at 3.6 @xmath4 : taurus , @xmath2 oph , cha i , ngc 1333 , ngc 2244 , and ic 348 .",
    "the first three are relatively large associations with reasonably well - behaved backgrounds ; we adopt their 24 @xmath5 m photometry directly from the literature , as introduced in appendix  [ cluster_list ] . the latter three , however , required new reductions and analyses of the mips data .",
    "we discuss our procedure for these three clusters in this section .",
    "the first step in analyzing these results was to apply the digital filter ( appendix c ) to eliminate all measurements likely to be contaminated significantly by diffuse emission .",
    "the second step is to estimate the extinction levels .",
    "the extinction , @xmath22 , of ic 348 has been fitted for most member stars based on their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the optical and near infrared @xcite . for ngc 1333 where most stars ( and all post - filtering members ) are",
    "later than k4 , we use the a@xmath23 values in @xcite . for ngc 2244",
    ", we find no optical observations for most of the stars in our membership lists observations for the field of .",
    "however , out of 369 stars in our membership list , only 67 are identified with sources in their optical catalog with a matching radius of 3 . ] , and we have to use @xmath24 vs @xmath25 to determine the extinction . for the extinction law , we adopt @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we adopt @xmath29 for @xmath30 between 3.6 @xmath4 and 24 @xmath4 @xcite . the approximation is valid because the extinction curve is almost flat from the irac bands to 24 @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we then use the extinction - corrected measurements in a color - magnitude diagram to identify and estimate any excesses at 3.6 @xmath4 , and correct our estimates of the excesses at 24 @xmath4 accordingly . for young stars with 3.6 @xmath4 excess , a conventional way to obtain the photospheric output is to examine a color - color diagram in the @xmath24 , @xmath31 , and 3.6 @xmath4 wavebands .",
    "however , color - color diagrams are not monotonic with stellar type in the jhk[3.6 ] range , so we turn to the color - magnitude diagram @xmath24 vs. @xmath32 $ ]",
    ". since all stars in a cluster have practically the same distance from us , their dereddened magnitudes are mutually comparable . the @xmath24 magnitude , as well as the @xmath33 $ ] color , are both monotonic with stellar mass .",
    "hence , this color - magnitude diagram provides a valid relation to determine the 3.6 @xmath4 photospheric output .",
    "there are a small number of stars ( @xmath34 10% of the total in any cluster ) for which we are unable to determine 3.6 @xmath5 m excesses ( e.g. , stars without 2mass detections ) . to reduce any resulting bias in our results",
    ", we estimate the photospheric levels for these stars assuming that they all have excesses that are the same as the average for the stars where we can determine the excesses individually .",
    "this may underestimate or overestimate the 3.6 @xmath4 photospheric output of individual stars .",
    "however , for the stars with individually estimated 3.6 @xmath4 photometry , the resulting correction to the excess at 24 @xmath4 is small , so the necessary scatter around the average for the remaining small number of stars will have little effect on our results .    with these corrections",
    ", we derive the 24 @xmath4 flux density of the stellar photospheres , @xmath18 , by the rayleigh - jeans relation from the 3.6 @xmath4 values .",
    "we use this approach because we do not have spectral types for the majority of the stars .",
    "we have found that the measured @xmath35 - [ 24]$ ] color is within 10% of the rayleigh - jeans value for stars earlier than m - type , and the maximum offset for stars in our samples ( @xmath0 m6 ) is @xmath0 30 % @xcite . in comparison",
    ", we will be analyzing excesses at the @xmath0 300% level ( see  4.1 ) , i.e. , small errors in the extrapolated photospheric values have little effect on the derived excesses .",
    "the excess disk emission at 24 @xmath4 , @xmath19 , is then obtained from equation  [ eq1 ] .",
    "the difference between considering the 3.6 @xmath4 excess and ignoring it becomes smaller as the clusters get older .",
    "for example , the corrections for 3.6 @xmath4 excesses for ngc 2362 affect the disk frequency ( defined in  4 ) by only 0.7% , lower than the poisson counting uncertainty by a factor of @xmath06 .    for sco - cen ( including upper sco ) and the bpmg , rather than extrapolating from 3.6 @xmath5 m we utilized the 2mass @xmath21 photometry because it is more complete .",
    "we first dereddened all the member stars with the extinction found in the literature , and then used the dereddened @xmath21 brightnesses of the stars to extrapolate to their 24 @xmath4 photospheric flux densities .",
    "this procedure should be accurate because the extinction levels are modest and the @xmath36 $ ] color depends only weakly on the spectral type for sources hotter than early m @xcite .",
    "similar extrapolation of the photospheric output from @xmath37-band to 24 @xmath5 m has been found to be accurate at the @xmath11 10% level @xcite .",
    "we have added the pleiades based on the study of @xcite . with an age of 126 myr @xcite at 136 pc @xcite ,",
    "it is near the end of the expected age range of terrestrial planet formation around solar - like stars , and provides a reference for the end state of disk frequency in that era .",
    "disk frequency , defined as the fraction of stars with infrared excesses within a cluster , has been widely employed in previous studies as a statistical measurement of disk evolution . for this study , the disk frequency , @xmath38 , at a relative excess threshold of @xmath39",
    "can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of filtered member stars satisfying the limits indicated , and @xmath42 is the total filtered population of the cluster .",
    "the error in @xmath43 is determined from the numbers of stars used in its calculation at any value of @xmath39 .    to define `` qualified disks , '' throughout this work",
    "we adopt a relative excess threshold of @xmath44 given the limited signal to noise , the distribution of detection levels may include some with excesses boosted above @xmath39 by noise .",
    "equation ( 2 ) allows us to correct for this effect on a statistical basis by subtracting those more negative than @xmath45 .",
    "as discussed below , we use this approach to extend our survey to sources below the conservative single - source detection limit .",
    "the threshold @xmath46 roughly corresponds to fractional luminosity @xmath47 , close to the maximum dust luminosity that a steady state debris disk is expected to reach ( @xmath48 a few @xmath49 in the age range considered in this work , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "debris disks typically have much lower fractional luminosities than primordial protoplanetary disks ( @xmath50 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , with this threshold most primordial disks should be counted , while only the most extreme debris disks could qualify @xcite .",
    "previous studies using disk counting have mostly been based only on stars bright enough to achieve good detections of their photospheres .",
    "studies in the @xmath51 and through the irac bands reach photospheric detection levels for solar - like stars out to @xmath0 1 kpc , making the identification of members with excess infrared emission straightforward . however , such a method for identifying disks is less feasible at 24 @xmath4 except for the nearest associations . at 24 @xmath4",
    "the mips detection limit is only sensitive enough for solar - like stars with @xmath52 out to @xmath0 600 pc . to extend this limit",
    ", we use an approach analogous to the probability of deflection , @xmath3 , methods originally developed for deep cosmological radio surveys to extract source counts below the threshold for reliable detection of individual objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but which now have found much broader use . for regions clear of background structure as determined by our filtering methods , we assume the intrinsic photometric errors on sky for each cluster are symmetric , i.e. , away from individually detected sources the positive and negative error distributions are the same .",
    "this assumption is supported by @xcite , who showed that the negative side of the error distribution for mips 24 @xmath4 data is well behaved and does not include a significant number of spurious large values . given the symmetric error distribution , we can use the random negative errors to estimate what fraction of the positive fluctuations in the cluster images exceed expectations for statistical errors .",
    "the excess of positive fluctuations should reveal the number of stars with real excesses on a statistical basis , i.e. not individually but through their influence on the spectrum of positive fluctuations .",
    "we apply this method to members of our `` secondary sample '' , i.e. , sources in clean sky but not detected individually . as described in section 3.1 , we obtained aperture photometry at the positions of these sources .",
    "we compare this photometry with the probability distribution of negative signals from similar photometry on the inverted images , i.e. with the negative error distribution .",
    "the excess of positive values at the positions of the sources is then a measure of their brightnesses on a statistical basis .",
    "nonetheless , even this approach can only go into the noise by a modest amount before the errors become overwhelming . to illustrate the range of usefulness , we consider ngc 1960 . because stars fade as they evolve , ngc 1960 , the oldest cluster in our sample farther than 1 kpc ,",
    "should give us a worst - case scenario down to its @xmath7 , the lowest - mass member star known , in this case about 1 m@xmath8 .",
    "the 1-@xmath53 noise level of the 24 @xmath4 mips image of ngc 1960 is 0.072 mjy , compared to the faintest stellar photosphere at 0.020 mjy .",
    "a star with an excess above our threshold of @xmath46 would therefore have a 24 @xmath5 m flux density of @xmath54 0.060 mjy , that is only slightly below the 1-@xmath53 detection limit .",
    "the limit to which our statistical method can be applied depends somewhat on the number of cluster members and of detections expected . in the limit where a large fraction of detections is expected ,",
    "p(d ) can reach well below the single - source detection limit before the uncertainties resulting from its internal statistics rival those in the expected number of sources ; however , if only a small fraction of detections is expected , p(d ) is much less effective . with 132 identified members and detections at the level of 12.9% for ngc 1960",
    ", valid estimates are returned down to about 1.5 @xmath53 of the noise .",
    "therefore , there is only a narrow range of flux density ( 0.06 to 0.11 mjy at 24 @xmath5 m ) , and thus of stellar mass above @xmath7 , over which we do not obtain valid estimates .",
    "this range is could only affect our estimate of the fraction of stars with excesses above @xmath46 if stars in this narrow range had an excess fraction dramatically different from the more massive stars , which is improbable .",
    "we show the overall decay of disk incidence with cluster / association age in figures 1 and 2 . with the exception of the low point for @xmath2 oph ,",
    "both figures indicate an almost constant incidence of qualified excesses for the initial phase of evolution ( up to @xmath0 6 myr on the revised scale , @xmath0 3 myr on the traditional one ) .",
    "although the decay of disk frequency is widely fitted with an exponential function , the behavior at 24 @xmath5 m appears to be inconsistent with this behavior .",
    "another constraint on the decay behavior is provided by transitional disks , which we show in this section argue strongly against exponential decay at 24 @xmath5 m .",
    "@xcite show that among disks with strong 24 @xmath4 excesses , the incidence of transitional disks increases from @xmath55% in stellar clusters between 1 and 6 myr of age to @xmath56% for those 9 - 12 myr in age ] .",
    "it is thought that the transitional stage is the final step before a primordial ( class ii ) disk loses its optically thick zones @xcite and thus its large 24 @xmath5 m excess . @xcite",

    ", the members of this class fall equally into the weak transitional and modest - excess class ii categories in @xcite , and hence these disks also fall within that analysis .",
    "however , whether all of these systems will lose their excesses without ever assuming even a weak transitional form ( as defined by @xcite ) is not clear , since the mechanism(s ) leading to the transitional stage are not well understood @xcite . in the following discussion",
    "we will make the common assumption that all disks _ do _ pass through the transitional stage @xcite .",
    "any disks with a different evolutionary path would presumably also have a different disk fraction decay pattern .",
    "@xcite show that the properties of the transitional disks do not appear to change significantly with cluster / association age .",
    "this behavior supports the view that all transitional disks are a similar phase that marks the loss of the inner disk material , independent of the age of the system .",
    "therefore , the increase in relative numbers of transitional disks indicates that an increasing fraction of the remaining class ii sources are entering the transitional phase with increasing age . the mathematical definition of exponential decay would be that class ii stars lose that status at a constant rate relative to the remaining number .",
    "this is incompatible with the increase in the fraction of transitional disks relative to the combined number of transitional and class ii systems .",
    "even if some systems skip the transitional stage , the large change in the proportion of transitional disks with age will strongly influence the overall disk fraction decay , in the direction just discussed .    in addition , a simple model based on exponential decay only and the best - fit time constant can not fit the transitional disk behavior ; it predicts nearly as large ( i.e. , 2/3 ) a fraction of these systems in the young sample ( 1 - 6 myr on the revised scale ) as in the older one ( 9 - 12 myr ) .",
    "thus , the behavior of the transitional disks indicates that evolution of the 24 @xmath4 excesses deviates significantly from an exponential trend .",
    "given the increase in the proportion of transitional disks with age , the deviation must be in the direction of the fading of class ii sources at larger ages being faster than the best - fit exponential , while the fading is slower than this exponential at smaller ages .      to discuss the non - exponential decay in the simplest possible way",
    ", we will use a heuristic model in which we assume that all stars start with class ii disks and that all disks pass from class ii to transitional to class iii , with the transitional phase having the same duration .",
    "we can take duration of the transitional phase , @xmath57 , to be @xmath0 1 - 1.5 myr under the revised age scale .",
    "we take the 6 @xmath5 m excesses to decay exponentially with a time scale of 5 myr from @xcite and @xcite , the latter as recalculated for the revised age scale in this paper .",
    "we assume that the 24 @xmath5 m excess decay is delayed by the transitional disk lifetime and thereafter decays exponentially with the same time constant as holds for the 6 @xmath5 m excesses , i.e. , 5 myr .",
    "the result for @xmath57 = 1 ( 1.5 ) myr is a prediction of an average fraction of 0.69 ( 0.74 ) excesses in the 1 - 6 myr range and a fraction of 0.17 ( 0.19 ) excesses in the 9 - 12 myr range .",
    "these values are in satisfactory agreement with the data as summarized in figure  [ 1]a .",
    "however , the heuristic model does not include a sufficiently rapid increase in the relative number of transitional disks to match the observations @xcite .",
    "it therefore , at best , provides a very conservative upper limit to the number of primordial disks surviving past 10 myr .",
    "a relatively simple modification to remedy this shortcoming is to assume that the relative rate at which systems enter the transitional stage from the pool of class ii sources increases linearly with time . under the revised age scale ,",
    "a coefficient of 0.04/myr for the fraction of disks entering the transitional stage and a transitional disk lifetime of 1 myr provide a reasonable fit to the data , with fractions of transitional disks of 9.7% and 38% respectively averaged over 0 - 6 myr and over 9 - 12 myr , compared with the observed values of 8.4 @xmath58 1.3% and 46 @xmath58 5% .",
    "this model also yields surviving fractions of disks averaged over 1 - 6 myr of 0.86 and over 9 - 12 myr of 0.18 , similar to the values from the heuristic model .",
    "the evolution under this model is shown as the gray line in figure 1a .",
    "the result is indicative , but not unique ; a variety of assumptions about the rate of entering the transitional stage and its lifetime would be consistent with the constraints , but would all have generally similar decay behavior .",
    "the prediction for the loss of disks in the intermediate wavelength regime would also be modified from an exponential in this model , but given the scatter in the values for clusters as a function of age @xcite , this alternative to exponential decay is allowed .",
    "we will preferably show the evolution of disk frequency on the revised age scale , since it provides a more demanding test of some important points we wish to make .",
    "when appropriate , we will show similar information on the traditional scale to illustrate that our conclusions hold equally well , or are stronger , using it .",
    "figure  [ 1]a shows the disk frequencies of the stellar clusters / associations in this study versus their ages ( on the revised scale ) .",
    "the relevant values are listed in table 3 . for reference",
    ", we show the prediction of our heuristic model , which does not account for the transitional disk behavior , and the fit taking account of the transitional disk behavior . for clarity , we do not show the heuristic model for ages @xmath11 11 myr .",
    "both fits are consistent with the evidence that primordial disks older than 20 myr are extremely rare @xcite .",
    "however , we find a significant fraction of stars with large excesses in this age range .",
    "figure 2 shows the same information as figure 1 but on the traditional timescale .",
    "all the ages @xmath6 15 myr are expected to be the same in both cases @xcite , but the ages less than this value are compressed toward zero . as a result , the enhanced disk incidence around 20 myr becomes very prominent .",
    "the behavior at ages @xmath59 3 myr is similar to that @xmath59 6 myr on the revised scale , although in the figure it is harder to see because of the compression .",
    "unfortunately , given the scatter among the results for the clusters / associations , their small number , and the uncertainties in age , it is not possible to derive a unique functional form for the decay of disk incidence from the 24 @xmath5 m data .",
    "there is also a degeneracy between the duration of the transitional phase and the rate at which systems enter it that makes determination of a functional form from that information difficult .",
    "nonetheless , figures 1 and 2 show that there is a slowly decaying component that persists to @xmath0 35 myr above the level indicated by extrapolation of the behavior of the primordial disks in younger systems , after which the incidence drops to a level similar to that in the pleiades .",
    "this component is apparent even relative to the heuristic model , which should overestimate the primordial disk incidence at these ages .",
    "for comparison with previous work , we begin by fitting the behavior at the shorter wavelengths with exponentials .",
    "assuming an exponential decay of disk frequency from unity at @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the cluster age @xcite , we fitted the evolution of the ten stellar clusters / associations of age 12 myr or younger , since this age range gives us a relatively pure population of primordial disks . on the traditional age scale , we reproduce the values in @xcite well .",
    "similar fits to the summary data in @xcite but with the revised ages give exponential decay time constants of 3.5 and 5.3 myr respectively for the `` short ( @xmath11 6 @xmath5 m ) '' and `` intermediate ( 8 - 12 @xmath5 m ) '' wavelength behavior .",
    "the second value agrees well with the 5.75 myr found by @xcite for irac excesses ( out through 8 @xmath5 m ) using the revised age scale .    at 24 @xmath5 m",
    ", the lifetime of qualified ( @xmath623 ) disks is found to be 6.6 @xmath58 0.4 myr , defined as the exponential time scale .",
    "we carried out a similar fit to the summary data in table a.1 of @xcite but assigning updated ages to the clusters consistent with those in this work , obtaining 7.6 @xmath58 1.3 myr .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory , considering our different disk definitions and functional forms . 1 to a baseline @xmath6 0",
    ", whereas we start at 1 and decay to 0 .",
    "] on the traditional age scale , the exponential time scale is 3.2 @xmath58 0.2 myr .    compared with the previous work @xcite , in addition to the different membership criteria , our approach is different in how `` disks '' are identified and counted .",
    "@xcite fit the seds of spectroscopically confirmed stars to obtain their expected photospheric fluxes at 24 @xmath4 , and they count individual disks based on the significance of excess detection ( @xmath63 above photospheric flux ) .",
    "although they have tried to correct biases @xcite , this criterion is highly dependent on the sensitivity and depth of the observations ( and hence the distance of the cluster ) , and also on the background behavior .",
    "our work provides an independent test of their results , with the advantage that the disk frequencies should be less biased because we account for the net effect of individually undetected sources , and reject stars on noisy backgrounds regardless of the significance of their excess detections .",
    "it is therefore gratifying that the two methods find virtually identical exponential decay behavior at 24 @xmath4 .",
    "however , the exponential fits are largely empirical and do not take account of the actual stages thought to influence disk decay .",
    "our heuristic model , in which the exponential decay is delayed by the time spent in the transitional stage , is a step toward a more realistic picture , and it yields a faster decay after the initial stages ( beyond 10 myr ) .",
    "our model that takes account of the transitional disk behavior in more detail decays even faster .",
    "@xcite also very sparsely sample the 11 - 40 myr interval at 24 @xmath5 m , which is represented only by 6 stars with excesses out of 43 in the bpmg .",
    "@xcite do not include stars older than 14 myr .",
    "thus , neither of these studies provides a good test of the disk behavior at 20 myr and beyond . as shown in figures  [",
    "1 ] and  [ 2 ] , the observed disk frequencies of the clusters older than @xmath020 myr are indeed higher than the extrapolated trends from the younger clusters , even assuming the very conservative heuristic model . for an extremely conservative estimate of the significance of the enhanced incidence of excesses ,",
    "we apply a @xmath64 test to the clusters between 15 and 40 myr ( both inclusive ) with the purely exponential decay ( @xmath65 = 7 myr ) fitted for the first 12 myr on the revised scale .",
    "we find that the probability that the disk frequency of the older clusters follows the same trend as the younger clusters is @xmath11 10@xmath66 , showing the necessity for a second , more slowly decaying disk component to fit the data",
    ". the probability would be substantially lower with the heuristic model , and lower still with the model incorporating the transitional disk behavior .      the evidence for the `` second component '' should not depend critically on our choice of the threshold , @xmath46 .",
    "we tested the robustness of our results by redoing figure  [ 1]a under new thresholds @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the outcomes are shown in figures  [ 1]b and c , respectively .",
    "the exponential decay timescales of disk frequency , with the clusters younger than 12 myr , are @xmath69 myr with @xmath67 and @xmath70 myr with @xmath68 , i.e. not significantly different .",
    "similarly , regardless of the difference in disk definition , the disk frequency starts to level out in the 10 - 15 myr age range and the `` second component '' remains prominent : the stellar groupings older than @xmath015 myr are all above the extrapolated trend .",
    "a potential risk in comparing the clusters over a wide range of distances arises from the different completeness limits in the membership lists .",
    "if the disk presence is correlated with spectral type , we may see different disk frequencies as a result of looking into different mass regimes . to address this issue , we take ngc 1960 as the reference for stellar mass , since it is the farthest cluster older than 20 myr in our sample and appears to lie in the middle of the age of the possible `` second component '' in disk evolution . the faintest detected member in ngc 1960",
    "has an extinction - corrected magnitude of @xmath35 = 14.2 $ ] , corresponding to @xmath01.2 m@xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we cut off the lower part of the membership lists of all nearer clusters and associations , making subsets of their members with this same mass limit cutoff and the general mass function @xcite , we estimate the average stellar masses of the stars in the subsets of all clusters are around 1.5 m@xmath8 . ] . the relation between stellar mass and photospheric brightness is more isochrone - dependent toward younger ages @xcite . for the most robust results",
    ", we only retained the stellar clusters / associations older than 9 myr . the mass cut - off is not applied to ngc 2362 , whose distance and completeness limit are similar to those of ngc 1960 , or to ucl and lcc , whose membership lists are already selected for f- and g - types .",
    "the result based on the trimmed membership lists is shown in figure  [ 2 ] , overplotted on the heuristic and transitional - disk - constrained decay lines obtained from the full membership lists , i.e. , the same decay lines as in figure  [ 1]a .",
    "although the member counts of some clusters have shrunk and thus enlarged the uncertainties , the disk frequencies of all clusters remain consistent within the errors with the results derived from the full membership lists .    to examine the behavior at lower masses , we show in figure  [ 4 ] the behavior for a mass range of 0.5 - 1.2 m@xmath71 , determined from clusters / associations within 400 pc .",
    "the results are very similar .",
    "the number of stars @xmath54 20 myr old with excesses above @xmath46 significantly exceeds the extrapolations from the behavior of primordial disks . to be specific , compared with the heuristic model and on the revised age scale , and assuming a poisson distribution for the excess counts between 20 and 35 myr , they have less than a 1% probability of arising by chance . the likelihood of their arising by chance with the model including the constraint from the transitional disks is much lower .",
    "these arguments are only strengthened under the traditional age scale .",
    "all of the fits ( simple exponential , heuristic , and transitional - disk ) show that the decay at 24 @xmath5 m is significantly slower than at the intermediate infrared wavelengths ( @xmath72 m ) defined by @xcite ( e.g. , from our fits to the summary in @xcite and on the revised age scale , from 5.3 to 7.6 myr respectively at @xmath72 m and 24 @xmath5 m ) .",
    "this general behavior is predicted by photoevaporation models that show erosion from inside and outside with the most durable radial zones lying near those dominating the 24 @xmath5 m emission @xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction is for a delay at 24 @xmath5 m only of order 0.5 myr after the dissipation of the region emitting near 6 @xmath5 m @xcite .",
    "the difference in exponential decay time constants is significantly larger , but the agreement is much better with the two more realistic fits to the decay behavior . with them , the predicted @xmath0 1 myr delay ( on the revised age scale ) in the erosion of the disk component dominant at 24 @xmath5 m compared with those seen at shorter wavelengths is consistent within a factor of two with the theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "we conclude that our analysis supports theoretical work by @xcite that predicts that disks dissipate by photoevaporation from both the inside ( near the star ) and the outside .",
    "that is , the dissipation of the disk zone where giant planets form should proceed under this mechanism more slowly by about 0.5 - 1 myr than that of the zones inside and outside this one .",
    "we now discuss the nature of the systems responsible for the `` second component '' of prominent disks .",
    "we will quantify their behavior for stars more massive than 1.2 m@xmath71 , since this threshold gives us relatively complete samples even for the more distant clusters / associations .",
    "given the difficulty in deriving a functional form for the decay of the protoplanetary disks , we have removed the primordial and transitional disks individually from the counts for the clusters / associations near 10 myr ( revised time scale ) , generally as identified in the papers providing the cluster membership lists .",
    "the resulting counts for disks around @xmath731.2 m@xmath8 stars and from 9 to 40 myr are shown in figure 4 ( the relevant fractions of excesses can be found in table 3 ) .",
    "we find that the evolution of the disk frequency in this age range can be described by a broad peak .",
    "if fitted empirically with a log - normal function and on the revised age scale , the peak frequency of these bright disks above the threshold of @xmath74 is @xmath75 and occurs at @xmath76 myr .",
    "based on the assumption of a log - normal evolution , integrating from the age of the maximum incidence afterwards , the mean duration of the high level of activity of the qualified debris disks is @xmath77 myr .",
    "similarly , if we use the traditional age scale the fitted parameters are peak of @xmath78 at @xmath79 myr , with a nominal post - peak lifetime of @xmath80 myr .",
    "the errors are estimated through a monte carlo simulation of 10,000 runs distributed normally as indicated by the nominal error bars .    in the following sections we consider possible explanations for this component of disk behavior .",
    "we first consider the possible persistence of protoplanetary disks into the 10 - 20 myr range .",
    "@xcite found 24 primordial disks and 2 be stars in upper sco , while @xcite found none .",
    "one of those 26 disks ( hd 142184 ) is below our excess threshold .",
    "that is , there are 23 identified primordial disks in upper sco and above our excess threshold , including 6 with masses higher than 1.2 m@xmath8 . for ngc 2362 , @xcite list 13 disks in their table 3 with primordial - like seds and spectral signatures of accretion .",
    "the current membership lists of ori ob1a and ob1b both have too few stars that are more massive than 1.2 m@xmath8 to contribute to this discussion .",
    "two detected disks in ucl and one in lcc are identified as primordial @xcite .",
    "however , the one in lcc ( hd 101088 ) is a rare case of a very low excess accretion disk that is fainter at 24 @xmath4 than our threshold @xcite .",
    "since it is never counted as a `` disk '' under our definition , we only identify the two ucl primordial disks from the combination of ucl and lcc . in summary , there appears to be a minority population of protoplanetary disks up to @xmath016 myr .",
    "we also investigated the nature of the individually detected disks in the older , 20 - 40 myr age range . in the bpmg , all members",
    "are individually detected and there are 6 qualified ( @xmath74 ) disks : @xmath1 pic ( a6 ) , v4046 sgr ( k5 + k7 ) , hd 172555 ( a7 ) , @xmath81 tel ( a0 ) , hd 181327 ( f6 ) , and hd 191089 ( f5 ) .",
    "the v4046 sgr disk is accreting ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and classified as transitional ( also circumbinary , see * ? ? ?",
    "however , the other five are bright debris disks .",
    "the other clusters in this age range are not known to contain accreting stars at a level that would qualify for our sample .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the general evidence that primordial disks do not survive up to this age range @xcite and therefore can not account for the second disk component .",
    "we next consider whether this peak in disk incidence is the initial starting point of the observed collisional steady - state decay of most known debris disks , such as that shown in @xcite . during the initial",
    "build - up of dust in the systems while they are approaching the quasi - steady - state equilibrium , the infrared emission of a single system peaks .",
    "the peaks of various initial mass and spectral - type systems coincide roughly with the period of oligarchic planet formation .",
    "therefore , simple steady - state decay could conceivably produce the observed peak in disk excess fractions .    to test this possibility ,",
    "we re - analyzed the models in @xcite .",
    "they modeled the 24 @xmath4 excess decay of a sample of 1097 sources with the numerical collisional model code - m via population synthesis . by placing the disks at @xmath05 au for solar - mass stars and @xmath011 au for early - type systems and assuming a log - normal distribution of initial disk masses",
    ", they were able to reproduce the observed fraction of disks with @xmath5410% excesses ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) . in this work ,",
    "we use the population of disks synthesized to match the large sample with low detection levels in @xcite , but set the observational threshold of the population to 300% above the photosphere ( for @xmath46 ) .",
    "this will naturally yield a lower percentage of sources with excesses . in figure [ model ] , we show the results of our modeling for the solar - mass and early - type populations , with the disks placed at 5.5 au from solar - mass stars and 11 au from early - types .",
    "the component from the protoplanetary disks has been removed from the observational data , based on the identifications in the original references , for direct comparison with the models .",
    "we have started the cascades at t = 0 as in @xcite , but with the expanded timescale it would be more appropriate to start them somewhat later , e.g. , t = 5 myr .",
    "however , it is clear that no starting time can fit the full population of large excesses .",
    "our analysis rules out steady - state evolution as the primary source of the peak .",
    "we conclude that the protoplanetary and transitional disks as well as passively evolving debris disks are a minority of the slowly decaying disks .",
    "we now show that these systems are likely to be debris ( i.e. , second - generation ) disks but ones experiencing stochastic events from large impacts that substantially increase their infrared emission .",
    "many studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that there should be copious amounts of debris generated by stochastic events occurring during the oligarchic / chaotic planetary formation phase .",
    "@xcite first suggested that this emission was likely to peak in the 10 - 40 myr period ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found some evidence in support of this suggestion .",
    "the self - stirring models of @xcite also produce broad maxima in the excess emission roughly in this time regime .    the recent detailed smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph )",
    "simulations of this process by @xcite substantially improve on these results .",
    "they model the growth of terrestrial planets through giant impacts of large protoplanets .",
    "each event results in the injection of a large amount of material ( up to @xmath0 1 m@xmath83 ) into orbit around the star , in the form of small fragments that quickly decay into dusty debris and large fragments that disappear much more slowly . as a result ,",
    "between 10 and 100 myr the debris disk around a star has many sharp increases in mass , some of which decay quickly ( direct collision products ) and some of which decay with characteristic time scales of a few million years ( larger collision products that are eroded by collisional cascades ) .",
    "@xcite compute the 24 @xmath5 m emission of the resulting debris system ; it reflects this behavior and often exceeds our threshold of three times the photospheric level .",
    "the level of emission tends to be largest between 10 and 30 myr ( their figure 6 ) , in excellent agreement with the results of our study .",
    "this possibility is also indicated by figure 7 , if the debris disk evolution is initiated at 10 - 15 myr rather than at zero .",
    "we have analyzed the rate at which 24 @xmath5 m excess emission indicative of circumstellar disks fades during the first 40 myr of evolution , based on a study of 15 stellar clusters and associations .",
    "our study focuses on bright disks , with 24 @xmath5 m emission three times or more of the photospheric outputs of the stars . because of uncertainties in age scales for young clusters / associations , we have carried out the analysis for the traditional scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a revised one that proceeds nearly two times more slowly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find that :    * on the traditional age scale for young stars , the exponential time scales for disk fading is @xmath84 myr for 24 @xmath5 m and @xmath0 2.5 myr for wavelengths shorter than 10 @xmath5 m @xcite . on the revised age scale ,",

    "based on the behavior of transitional disks , the fading at 24 @xmath5 m is not accurately exponential , but is slower than the best fit exponential initially but faster by an age of 10 myr .",
    "* taking account of this behavior rather than fitting an exponential indicates a delay of @xmath0 1 myr ( revised age scale ) or less than 1 myr ( traditional scale ) in the dispersion of the 24 @xmath5 m disk component after the dispersion of the component dominant near 6 @xmath5 m , in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical predictions of @xcite .",
    "this delay also agrees well with the lifetime of roughy 1 myr for the transitional disk phase .",
    "this agreement between observation and theory indicates that disks disperse by photoevaporation and from both the inside and the outside , with the zone dominating the 24 @xmath5 m emission being relatively slow to dissipate . * after this initial fading , there is a continuing bright disk population to @xmath0 35 myr .",
    "* this population includes some protoplanetary disks in the 10 - 16 myr range , but is dominated by bright debris disks . * after identifying and excluding the contribution from protoplanetary disks , the incidence of debris disks can be described by a log - normal function with the peak on the revised age scale at 18.1 @xmath58 1.1 myr where it is 12.3% @xmath58 2.9% of the original population .",
    "after the peak , the incidence of debris disks decays with an indicated lifetime of @xmath86 myr .",

    "visual inspection is usually employed for identification of sources where the background is well - enough behaved that reliable photometry can be obtained . however",
    ", this approach favors bright sources that stand out against the background structure , and therefore is biased toward high mass stars and stars with large 24 @xmath4 excesses . to obtain an unbiased sampling of the 24 @xmath4 behavior of members of a cluster requires that the bad photometry be filtered out in a way that does not bias the sample ; that is , on the basis of the background behavior alone , with no influence from the properties of the star .",
    "this appendix discusses our approach to this challenge .",
    "we have developed a digital filter to reject unreliable photometry .",
    "the concept is similar to the filter used by @xcite , with some additional criteria to make the screening more selective .",
    "we take , a cluster with a complicated background , to test and tune the filter .",
    "several metrics describing the sky pixel statistics were tested ; in the end , we settled on three of them . for each of the cluster members , we compute the normalized value for the following three parameters",
    "the first is the average sky brightness , determined by computing the intensity - weighted means of the sky pixel values in sky annuli around a source .",
    "we used different sky annuli for different clusters and the choices are listed in table 1 .",
    "the second is the skewness of the distribution of the sky pixel values , defined within the sky annuli around the sources .",
    "a well behaved background region should show a normal distribution of noise .",
    "the third is the gradient of the local sky brightness in a star s surrounding area , measured for convenience on the basis of the signals in four small ( 4 pixels in radius ) circular regions surrounding the star ( ten pixels distant in each of the cardinal directions ) .",
    "the three parameters are expected to be mutually independent .",
    "therefore , we make each of them a dimension within a three dimensional cartesian parameter space .",
    "since each of the three dimensions has a different unit , we define a scalar threshold in `` distance '' in the parameter space by dividing each by its median for a particular cluster ( we do not use the means because they are more easily affected by a relatively small number of extreme values ) . to evaluate the reliability of the photometry of individual stars , we define a virtual distance in the parameter space as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the @xmath106-th dimensionless parameter .",
    "stars with relatively small values of @xmath107 are on clean and well - behaved backgrounds and should have the most reliable photometry . in few cases ,",
    "one of the parameters has a much wider distribution after normalization , therefore , it dominates the d space .",
    "we then adjust the parameter by multiplying all values in that dimension by a suitable constant ( see figure c.1 for an example ) .",
    "we calibrated this filter on a sample of stars in that were first evaluated visually to set plausible image detection limits .",
    "we obtained aperture photometry for the cluster and looked for stars measured only at a low ratio of signal to noise ( @xmath11 8 in the case of ; clusters with cleaner backgrounds allowed lower signal to noise thresholds ) but that were measured to be brighter than the image detection limits .",
    "a properly tuned digital filter should reject these cases .",
    "we defined the cutoff threshold in @xmath107 at the largest value yielding none of these cases , i.e. examples of stars with poor signal to noise but apparent signals above the image detection limit .",
    "figure  [ filtering ] shows the distribution of sources below the signal to noise threshold ( 8) in in each of the three filter parameters . only stars with @xmath107 below the threshold above which false detections began to occur",
    "were accepted into our study .",
    "we confirmed the operation of the filter by manually inspecting each star that passed its test .",
    "a problem with the filter is that it occasionally rejects very bright stars where the stellar psfs extend at significant levels to the sky annuli and raise the mean brightness therein .",
    "such stars are rare ( @xmath11 2% ) of the accepted stars in general ; we recover them manually .",
    "the recovered stars are selected carefully to minimize the risk of introducing any bias : only very bright stars ( @xmath73 15 mjy ) on low and clean background with non - rejected stars nearby are recovered . since the number of such stars is much fewer than the filtered population in each cluster , the manually recovered stars do not significantly influence our conclusions even if some of them were recovered inappropriately .",
    "since the parameter space and distance cutoff threshold are defined only on the brightness and distribution of sky background , our method should be neither subject to arbitrary human visual selection , nor biased by any source properties .",
    "hence , it only scales down the sample size for each cluster , but should introduce no selection effects .",
    "we ran the following simulation to demonstrate the validity of the filtering with a complex field background .",
    "we based this simulation on the epoch 1 image of ic 348 .",
    "since ic 348 has the most complicated 24 @xmath4 background in all the clusters analyzed in this paper , it provides a worst - case test .",
    "the simulation gives us confidence in both the photometry of individual sources and also the ability of the filter to identify the sources where it is acceptable to consider the noise ( positive and negative ) to be unbiased .",
    "we made five runs of simulations .",
    "for each run , we generated a group of log - normally distributed random numbers as the 24 @xmath4 flux densities of the simulated fake stars .",
    "each fake star was place at random image coordinates .",
    "the psf for the fake stars was the same one that was used to extract our psf - fitting photometry .",
    "the field of ic 348 is not crowded by detected stars at 24 @xmath4 .",
    "this leads us to avoid adding too many fake stars in a single run , because that would make a larger number of overlapped psfs , and potentially induce larger photometric error than in the original field .",
    "after a few tests , we finally chose 200 fake stars for each run , making the total number of test fake stars 1000 .",
    "we reduce and analyze the simulated image of each run like a new cluster by applying identical procedures as for the real cluster .",
    "this includes taking the simulated fake star coordinates as the initial guess for star positions , allowing a maximum shift of 2  for source matching , making psf - fitting photometry , applying the filter , and finally visually inspect the image .",
    "finally , 610 stars pass the filtering process .    after going through the entire data reduction procedure ,",
    "our photometry was compared against the brightness of the fake stars .",
    "since the photometric errors may be correlated with the brightness of the stars , the comparisons were evaluated in units of @xmath53 ( the nominal photometric errors ) , rather than in units of flux density .",
    "the outcomes are shown in figure  [ error ] .",
    "for the unfiltered case , the wide distribution in units of @xmath53 indicates that the photometric errors have been statistically underestimated , probably because the algorithm for error estimation did not work well with such complicated nebulous background .",
    "nevertheless , we find a significant asymmetry in the photometric error distribution in the original 1000 fake stars .",
    "the mean bias is + 2.2-@xmath53 brighter than the input values , with a skewness of 14.1 .",
    "however , after applying the filter , the retained population of 610 stars has a mean bias of + 0.4-@xmath53 and a skewness of 0.8 , which is essentially symmetric with respect to 0 .",
    "in addition , this result supports our assumption of symmetry in the noise , allowing the extraction of excess positive signals on a statistical basis even if they are below the threshold for individual detections .",
    "this conclusion holds because we applied this test at the positions of cluster members identified at shorter wavelengths , but only if they passed the screening for well - behaved background using the digital filter ."
