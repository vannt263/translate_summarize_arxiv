    "core collapse supernovae occur at the end of the evolution of massive stars .",
    "the mechanism of this event is not clearly understood yet because of their intricacies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the underlying problems is the equations of state ( eos s ) of hot and dense matter both at sub- and supra - nuclear densities .",
    "eos provides information on compositions of nuclear matter in addition to thermodynamical quantities such as pressure , entropy and sound velocities .",
    "the compositions play important roles at both pre- and post- bounce phases . in collapsing cores",
    ", they have an influence on the rate of electron captures and neutrino coherent scatterings on nuclei , both of which determine the evolution of the lepton fraction , one of the most critical ingredients for the core dynamics .",
    "after bounce they affect the rates of heating and cooling through the neutrino emission and absorption on nucleons and nuclei .",
    "the eos for the simulations of core collapse supernovae must cover a wide range of density ( @xmath1 ) and temperature ( @xmath2  mev ) , including both neutron - rich and proton - rich regimes .",
    "one of the difficulties in constructing the eos is originated from the fact that depending on the density , temperature and proton fraction , the matter consists of either dilute free nucleons or a mixture of nuclei and free nucleons or strongly interacting dense nucleons .",
    "another complication is the existence of the so - called nuclear pasta phases , in which nuclear shapes change from droplet to rod , slab , anti - rod and bubble ( anti - droplet ) as the density increases toward the nuclear saturation density , at which uniform nuclear matter is realized @xcite . at high temperatures ( @xmath3  mev ) ,",
    "chemical equilibrium is achieved for all strong and electromagnetic reactions , which is referred to as nuclear statistical equilibrium , or nse , and the nuclear composition is determined as a function of density , temperature , and proton fraction @xcite . at lower temperatures , the matter composition is an outcome of preceding nuclear burnings and can not be obtained by statistical mechanics . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the high temperature regime , in which the nuclear composition can be treated as a part of eos .    at present",
    ", there are only two eos s in wide use for the simulations of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "lattimer - swesty s eos is based on skyrme - type nuclear interactions and the so called compressible liquid drop model for nuclei surrounded by dripped nucleons @xcite .",
    "the eos by shen et al . employs a relativistic mean field theory ( rmf ) to describe nuclear matter and the thomas - fermi approximation for finite nuclei with dripped nucleons.@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized here that both eos s adopt the so - called single nucleus approximation ( sna ) , in which only a single representative nucleus is included . in other words ,",
    "the ensemble of nuclei is ignored .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that sna is not a bad approximation for thermodynamical quantities such as pressure .",
    "it is not the case , however , for the weak interaction rates , since the electron capture rates are sensitive to nuclear shell structures and the greatest contributor is not the most abundant nuclei that the single representative nuclei in sna are supposed to approximate @xcite .",
    "in addition to the approximative calculation of heavy nuclei , only alpha particles are included in both eos s as a representative light nucleus . it is predicted that not only alpha particles but deuterons , tritons and helions are also abundant in the cooling and heating regions of cores and envelopes after bounce @xcite .    in this decade ,",
    "some eos s including multi - nuclei have been formulated by different research groups .",
    "although all models assumed nse , models for nuclei are different .",
    "eos @xcite is a generalization of the statistical model , which is one of the most successful models used for the theoretical description of multifragmentation reactions induced by heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the nuclear energies in this model is based on the liquid drop model for the mass number up to @xmath4 .",
    "however they ignored the shell effects of nuclei , which are important for reproducing the abundance of nuclei at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite utilized two mass tables , which are based on experimental data @xcite and theoretical estimation for isolated nuclei @xcite .",
    "due to the limitation of the mass tables , heavy nuclei with proton number @xmath5 are not included in their nse calculations .",
    "they also ignored the high - density and -temperature effects on nuclear bulk and surface energies , which are explained in the later section .",
    "@xcite employed two different theories , the virial expansion at low densities and sna with the hartree approximation at high densities .",
    "the multi - nuclei description is employed only in the low density regime and some quantities such as the mass fraction of free proton are discontinuous at the transition between the two descriptions . @xcite made an equation of state , focusing on light nuclei .",
    "they employed a generalized density - dependent rmf , which is applied not only to protons and neutrons but also to deuterons , tritons , helions @xmath6he@xmath7 and alpha particles .",
    "we constructed an eos @xcite based on the nse description with the mass formula for nuclei up to the atomic number of 1000 under the influence of surrounding nucleons and electrons .",
    "the mass formula is derived from the experimental data of nuclear binding energies and enables us to take into account nuclear shell effects .",
    "the liquid drop model is extended to describe medium effects and , in particular , the formation of the pasta phases .",
    "the free energy thus obtained of the multi - component system can reproduce the ordinary nse results at low densities and make a continuous transition to the eos for supra - nuclear densities .",
    "the details of the model and comparisons with h. shen s eos and hempel s eos are given in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to improve the previous model incorporating some missing important effects and construct a more realistic eos for the core - collapse supernova simulations . as a matter of fact",
    ", our previous eos shows unphysical jumps in the isotope distributions between the nuclei with the experimental mass data and those without them .",
    "this is demonstrated in the paper , in which we compare three different eos s with multi - nuclei handling @xcite .",
    "the main cause for this unphysical behavior is the lack of the temperature dependence in the bulk energies for the nuclei with mass data .",
    "we hence modified the expression of bulk energies so that the temperature dependence could be incorporated in this work . furthermore the shell effects are taken into account only for a limited number of nuclei in our previous eos , since we have used only experimental mass data @xcite to obtain the shell effects . in this work , on the other hand",
    ", we utilize the theoretical mass data @xcite which covers 15134 nuclei that have no the experimental mass data . in our previous eos",
    ", we adopt the liquid drop model even for light nuclei such as deuterons , tritons , helions and alpha particles .",
    "it is known that the liquid drop mass formula poorly reproduces the experimental mass data of the light nuclei with the mass numbers about @xmath8 or smaller @xcite . in this article",
    ", we treat light nuclei as quasi - particles immersed in dense and hot nucleons following @xcite .",
    "other improvements in this article are saturation densities of individual nuclei and the contributions of excited states to partition functions . in the following",
    ", we report on these new ingredients and discuss the differences from the previous version .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we overview the model free energy to be minimized and the details of new developments from the previous eos .",
    "note that the basic formulation of the model free energy and its minimization are unchanged from the previous version .",
    "the results are shown in section 3 , with an emphasis on the differences from the previous eos .",
    "the paper is wrapped up with a summary and some discussions in section  4 .",
    "to obtain the multi - component eos s , we construct a model free energy and minimize it with respect to the parameters included . the matter in the supernova core at sub - nuclear densities",
    "consists of nucleons and nuclei together with electrons and photons .",
    "the latter two are not treated in this paper although the inclusion of them as ideal fermi and bose gases respectively is quite simple and now a routine .",
    "note that the coulomb energies between protons , both inside and outside nuclei , and electrons are contained in the eos and we assume the electrons are uniformly distributed .",
    "neutrinos are not always in thermal or chemical equilibrium with the matter and can not be included in the free energies of nuclei .",
    "their non - equilibrium distributions should be computed with the transport equations .",
    "the free energy is constructed as a sum of the contributions from free nucleons not bound in nuclei , light nuclei defined here as those nuclei with the proton number @xmath9 , and the rest of heavy nuclei with the proton and neutron numbers , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this classification of heavy or light nuclei is based on whether ldm is a good approximation in reproducing the experimental mass data or not .",
    "it is known that the difference between ldm and experimental masses is large for the nuclei with the mass number @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we hence set the light nuclei as those with @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the free nucleons outside nuclei interact with themselves only in the volume that is not occupied by other nuclei ; light nuclei are the quasi particles whose masses are modified by the surrounding free nucleons ; heavy nuclei are also affected by the free nucleons and electrons , depending on the temperature and density , and contact with each other at some density and merge into pastas near the saturation densities .",
    "the free energy of free nucleons is calculated by the rmf theory with the excluded volume effect being taken into account .",
    "the model free energy of heavy nuclei is based on the liquid drop mass formula .",
    "the free energy of light nuclei is approximately calculated by quantum many body theory . in constructing the mass formula of heavy nuclei ,",
    "the following issues are appropriately taken into account : the nuclear masses at low densities and temperatures should be equal to those of isolated nuclei in vacuum and the shell energies of nuclei are crucially important to reproduce the ordinary nse ( e.g. @xcite ) ; one should take into account the effect that the nuclear bulk , shell , coulomb and surface energies are affected by the free nucleons and electrons at high densities and temperatures ; furthermore the pasta phases near the saturation densities should be also accounted for to ensure a continuous transition to uniform matter .",
    "only the bubble phase is explicitly considered in the coulomb and surface energies and other pasta phases are just interpolated between the normal droplet and bubble phases .    in the following subsections , we explain the details of the free energy density expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the free energy densities of free nucleons , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the number density and free energy of individual nucleus , index @xmath17 specifying a light nucleus with the proton number @xmath18 and index @xmath19 meaning a heavy nucleus with the proton number @xmath20 , respectively . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the translational energies and rest masses of heavy and light nuclei .",
    "we begin with the mass evaluation of heavy nuclei @xmath23 focusing on the modifications from our previous eos in section  [ sechn ] .",
    "then we describe the mass estimation of the light nuclei @xmath24 in section [ secln ] .",
    "the translational energies of heavy and light nuclei @xmath25 are explained in section [ sectr ] .",
    "we finally mention the evaluation of thermodynamical quantities from the free energy in section  [ secth ] .",
    "since the free energy density of free nucleons based on the rmf theory @xmath14 and the minimization of the total free energy densities are just the same as in the previous paper @xcite , we briefly describe them below .",
    "the free energy density of free nucleons is calculated by the rmf theory with the tm1 parameter set , which is the same as that adopted in @xcite .",
    "we take into account the excluded - volume effect : free nucleons can not move in the volume occupied by other nuclei , @xmath26 .",
    "then the local number densities of free protons and neutrons are defined as @xmath27 with the total volume , @xmath28 , and the numbers of free protons , @xmath29 , and free neutrons , @xmath30 .",
    "then the free energy densities of free nucleons are defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the free energy density in the unoccupied volume for nucleons , @xmath33 , obtained from the rmf theory at @xmath34 , @xmath35 and temperature @xmath36 .",
    "the abundances of nuclei as a function of @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 are obtained by minimizing the model free energy with respect to the number densities of nuclei and nucleons under the constraints , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are number densities of baryon and electrons and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the mass and proton numbers of nucleus @xmath44 .",
    "the minimization of our free energy density is not the same as that in the ordinary nse . in the latter",
    ", one has only to solve the constraints , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cons ] ) , at a given @xmath45 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 for two variable , i.e. , the chemical potentials of nucleons @xmath46 and @xmath47 , through saha equations . in our case , the free energy density of nuclei depends on the local number densities of proton and neutron @xmath48 as we will describe later .",
    "thus the number densities of nuclei are not determined by @xmath46 and @xmath47 alone but they also depend on @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we hence have to solve the equations relating @xmath49 and @xmath48 as well as the two constraint equations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cons ] ) , to determine the four variables : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the nuclear mass is assumed to be equal to the sum of shell , bulk , coulomb and surface energies : @xmath51 . in this study",
    ", we treat the shell energies separately from the bulk energies for the nuclei with mass data unlike in the previous model , in which the shell effect was included in the bulk energies .",
    "this is because we take into account the temperature dependence of the bulk energies for the nuclei with mass data .",
    "furthermore , we incorporate the dependence of the saturation density @xmath52 of each nucleus @xmath19 on @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the formulation of coulomb and surface energies is just identical to the previous one .",
    "we define the saturation densities of nuclei @xmath53 as the baryon number density , at which the free energy per baryon @xmath54 given by the rmf with @xmath55 takes its minimum value .",
    "thus @xmath56 depends on the temperature @xmath36 and the proton fraction in each nucleus @xmath57 . at high temperatures the free energy , @xmath58 ,",
    "has no minimum because the entropy contribution , the @xmath59 term with @xmath60 being entropy , overwhelms the internal energy . in the previous paper , @xmath52 is set to the saturation density given by h. shen eos at temperatures higher than the critical temperature @xmath61 , above which the free energy , @xmath58 , has no minimum .",
    "this prescription brought unphysical jumps in the mass fraction at the critical temperatures in the previous eos . in order to remedy this artifact",
    ", we assume in the new eos that the saturation density @xmath56 above @xmath61 is equal to the saturation density at the critical temperature @xmath62 . fig .",
    "[ satu ] shows the saturation density @xmath63 for the proton - fractions @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the @xmath66 plane .",
    "we can see that neutron - rich nuclei have lower saturation densities and critical temperatures than symmetric nuclei because of the symmetry energy .",
    "when the saturation density @xmath52 is lower than the baryon number density of the whole system @xmath40 , we reset the saturation density as the baryon number density @xmath67 as shown in fig .",
    "[ satu2 ] .",
    "this prescription approximately represents compressions of nuclei near the saturation densities .",
    "these treatments of the saturation density are important in obtaining reasonable bulk energies at high temperatures and densities .",
    "they are necessary , since it is impossible at the moment to solve nuclear structures and abundance in a self - consistent manner completely .",
    "in fact , the density of each nucleus is not a quantity to be determined by the minimization of the free energy density but a parameter to be set in our model .",
    "we expect , however , that the density of each nucleus is very close to the saturation density , that is , the density , at which the free energy density of uniform nuclear matter becomes minimum for the same temperature and proton fraction except when the saturation density does not exist at high temperatures or when the transition to uniform nuclear matter occurs at a density higher than the saturation density . to these cases",
    "we need special cares as described above .      to calculate the coulomb and surface energies of nuclei we set the wigner - seitz cell ( w - s cell ) for each species of nuclei so that the charge neutrality could be satisfied .",
    "each nucleus is centered in the w - s cell with the volume , @xmath68 .",
    "the cell also contains free nucleons as a vapor outside the nucleus as well as electrons , which are assumed to be uniform in the entire cell .",
    "the charge neutrality in the cell gives the cell volume @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the volume of the nucleus in the cell and can be calculated as @xmath71 .",
    "the vapor volume and nucleus volume fraction in the cell are given by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .    in this eos",
    "we assume that each nucleus enters the nuclear pasta phase individually when the volume fraction , @xmath74 , reaches @xmath75 and that the bubble shape is realized when it exceeds @xmath76 @xcite . the bubbles are explicitly treated as nuclei of spherical shell shapes with the vapor nucleons filling the inside .",
    "this phase is important to ensure continuous transitions to uniform matter as noted in @xcite . the intermediate states ( @xmath77 ) are smoothly interpolated from the normal and bubble states .",
    "the criterion of intermediate states ( @xmath78 ) is admittedly rather arbitrary , although we consulted the literature @xcite in adopting these numbers .",
    "we have hence tried another choice , @xmath79 , and confirmed that the thermodynamic quantities are hardly affected . on the other hand ,",
    "the nuclear composition is rather sensitive to the criterion particularly when the temperature is low and most of nuclei form pastas simultaneously , since the surface and coulomb energies are modified .",
    "since the density region that corresponds to the intermediate states is narrow and the sums of coulomb and surface energies for the drop and bubble states are equal to each other at @xmath80 , the inclusion of the intermediate phase is chiefly meant to ensure the smooth change in mass fractions of nuclei around @xmath80 .",
    "the evaluation of the coulomb energy in the w - s cell is given by the integration of coulomb forces in the cell : @xmath81 with @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the elementary charge .",
    "the surface energy of nuclei is given by the product of the nuclear surface area and the surface tension .",

    "@xmath87 denotes the surface tension for symmetric nuclei .",
    "the surface tension @xmath88 includes the surface symmetry energy , i.e. , neutron - rich nuclei have lower surface tensions than symmetric nuclei .",
    "the values of the constants , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , are adopted from the paper by @xcite .",
    "the appropriate estimation of surface tensions is important , since they have a critical influence on the abundance of nuclei and , as a consequence , on the average mass number of nuclei , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we may choose other values such as those given in @xcite , which include high - order temperature dependences .",
    "we prefer the simpler estimate by @xcite in this work , considering insufficient experimental information on the heavy and/or neutron - rich nuclei that exist in the supernova matter .",
    "the last factor in eq.([eq : surf ] ) , @xmath91 , is assumed to take into account the effect that the surface energy should be reduced as the density contrast decreases between the nucleus and the nucleon vapor .",
    "we use cubic polynomials of @xmath74 for interpolation between the droplet and bubble phases .",
    "the four coefficients of the polynomials are determined by the condition that the coulomb and surface energies are continuous and smooth as a function of @xmath74 at @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we derive the bulk energies from the free energy per baryon of the uniform nuclear matter at the saturation density @xmath52 for the given temperature @xmath36 and proton fraction inside the nuclei @xmath57 as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the free energy per baryon given by the rmf , which is the same as that for the free energy density of free nucleons .",
    "note that this bulk energy includes the symmetry energy of nuclei . in the previous paper , eq.(7 ) is applied only to the nuclei with no experimental mass data . for the nuclei with experimental mass data available , on the other hand ,",

    "( [ eq : bulk ] ) so that the bulk energies of all nuclei would depend on the temperature .",
    "we include the shell effects separately in the mass formula of nuclei by using both experimental and theoretical mass data @xcite to better reproduce the ordinary nse eos results in the low density regime .",
    "the regions , in which the experimental and theoretical mass data are available , are shown in nuclear chart in the fig .",
    "the shell energies are obtained from the experimental or theoretical mass data by subtracting our liquid drop mass formula , which does not include the shell effects , @xmath97 in the vacuum limit as @xmath98_{vacuum}$ ] .",

    "we have observed that at @xmath240  mev the mass fractions of alpha particles given by h. shen s eos are larger than those in our eos and are smaller than the total mass fractions of all light nuclei obtained in our eos .",
    "this result implies that we can not neglect deuterons , tritons and helions and the replacement of the ensemble of light nuclei by alpha particles is a rather poor approximation at high temperatures .",
    "although we can not compare our new eos with other multi - nuclei eos s , it is possible to infer that our new model ( model  2b ) will give the mass fractions of heavy nuclei similar to those obtained in botvina s eos @xcite at high temperatures .",
    "this is because both eos s take into account the temperature dependent bulk energies for all heavy nuclei , as we have described in detail so far in this paper .",
    "there should be , of course , some differences , which could originate from the different estimations of the surface energies and inclusions of the shell energies , which are actually not taken into account in their eos @xcite . at low temperatures",
    ", the new eos may give the abundances of heavy nuclei similar to those obtained by @xcite .",
    "this is because both eos s include the shell effects for the neutron - rich and/or heavy nuclei by using theoretical estimations of nuclear masses .",
    "note , however , the difference between the theoretical mass data provided by @xcite , which are used in @xcite and those provided by @xcite , which are adopted in this paper , may have some influences on the abundances of nuclei . as for the light nuclei abundances",
    ", we believe that our eos is more reliable abundances than others , since ours takes into account the pauli- and self - energies shifts , which could be important in medium .",
    "it is also pointed out that in hempel s eos , @xmath165 , the contribution from the internal degree of freedom to the nuclear partition function , is also applied to light nuclei with the integration range being somewhat limited despite the fact that deuterons have no excited states .",
    "hemepl s eos may hence overestimate the light nuclei abundance in some cases although they found no significant difference from the results in more involved calculations by @xcite and @xcite @xcite .",
    "we infer from @xcite and @xcite that thermodynamics quantities are not so different from different eos s except at high densities , where the treatments of the pasta phase and abundances of light nuclei may make some differences .",
    "there is a room for improvement in our eos .",
    "the interpolation of the shell energy and the treatment of the pasta phase are entirely phenomenological and need justification or sophistication somehow .",
    "we may have to improve the eos of uniform matter , which is needed to evaluate the free energy density of the free nucleons and bulk energies of heavy nuclei .",
    "in fact , the rmf is known to have the symmetry energy larger than the canonical value , which will affect the neutron - richness , @xmath259 , of heavy nuclei . in our formulation , however , it is quite simple to change the eos of uniform nuclear matter , once it is provided .",
    "the combination with another eos for supra - nuclear densities is indeed under progress at present .",
    "the update of the surface tensions of nuclei , especially of neutron - rich nuclei , should be considered according to the progresses in theories and experiments .",
    "the construction of the table based on model  2b in this paper and its application to supernova simulations are also under way .",
