    "the first optical identifications of ( bright ) radio sources with ( faint ) galaxies were made when hy spinrad was still a teenager ( windhorst 1999 ; these proceedings ) .",
    "after that it was soon realized that the ` invisible ' universe of radio sources provided convenient beacons to locate very distant galaxies and thus might be used to study their formation and evolution .",
    "as so eloquently described by several of hy s colleagues , collaborators and ex  students in these proceedings , he became an early key player in these distant galaxy hunts .",
    "for most radio astronomers in those days the universe stopped at the poss limits .",
    "surely , many radio sources could not be identified , but so what ?",
    "it just confirmed that the universe was bigger than the biggest optical telescope , but ... not bigger than the biggest _ radio _ telescope !",
    "occasionally hy would write letters to leiden observatory radio astronomers with requests of radio maps and accurate positions .",
    "when provided he would spend many hours using one of the world s then finest telescopes at lick observatory , to obtain optical identifications and spectra of these hyzrg candidates ( presumably squeezed in between observations of standard stars for jim liebert ; these proceedings ) .",
    "how foolish this seemed , to some of us ( wvb ) .    since then extraordinary progress in the development of optical and near  ir detectors , larger telescopes , and better selection techniques have resulted in discoveries of radio galaxies at increasingly hyer redshifts .",
    "paradoxically this task was eased by the discovery , first by hy and his collaborators , that the ly@xmath0  emission line was very strong in radio galaxies and could easily be detected in @xmath1 hr integrations with 3m  class telescopes ( spinrad et al .",
    "1985 ) , provided that the redshifts would be hy enough ( @xmath2 ) so that ly@xmath0  would enter the observable optical window .",
    "it has now become clear that hyzrgs are both a boon and a curse for students of galaxy evolution .",
    "a boon because the near  ir hubble @xmath3 relation for radio sources appears well represented by the predicted ` passive ' evolution of massive ( @xmath4 l@xmath5 ) galaxies with hy formation redshifts ( lilly & longair 1984 ; eales et al .",
    "1997 ; best et al .",
    "1998 ; van breugel et al .  1999 ) , despite the effects of k  correction and morphological evolution ( van breugel et al .  1998 ) .",
    "no matter the reason for this relationship , it suggests that radio sources might be used to find massive galaxies and their likely progenitors out to very hy redshift .",
    "this method was first successfully used by lilly ( 1988 ) to identify the hyzrg b2  0902@xmath634 at @xmath7 .",
    "deep spectroscopic observations of a few relatively weak radio sources ( but still of the powerful double frii class ! ) , where the agn do not affect the rest ",
    "frame uv as much ( see below ) , have shown directly examples of radio galaxies at @xmath8 with old ( @xmath9 gyr ) stellar populations with implied formation redshifts @xmath10 ( e.g. ,  spinrad et al .",
    "1997 ) .    for galaxy formation studies hyzrgs",
    "are also cursed because their structures are aligned with their associated radio sources , suggesting that the collimated outflow and ionizing radiation from their agn profoundly affect their parent galaxy host appearances at uv , blue and green wavelengths ( mccarthy 1999 , and dey 1999 ; these proceedings ) .",
    "hyzrgs are very well suited for studying the effects of powerful agn on ambient dense gas , including induced star formation ( e.g. ,  bicknell et al .  1999 ) , and may even be used as searchlights to investigate the properties of proto  galactic material in the early universe ( cimatti et al .",
    "1997 ; villar  martn et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "recent cosmological theories are providing additional incentives to use radio galaxies as probes to study the early universe . within standard cold dark matter scenarios",
    "the formation of galaxies is a hierarchical and biased process .",
    "large galaxies are thought to grow through the merging of smaller systems , and the most massive objects form in over  dense regions , which will eventually evolve into the clusters of galaxies seen today ( e.g. ,  white 1997 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that the first massive black holes may grow in similar hierarchical fashion together with their parent galaxies ( e.g. ,  kauffmann and haehnelt 1999 ) or , because of time scale constraints , may precede galaxy formation and be primordial ( e.g. ,  loeb 1993 ) . to confront these theories",
    "it is therefore of great interest to find the progenitors of the most massive galaxies and their agn ( active massive black holes ) at the hyest possible redshifts and to study their properties and cosmological evolution .    while optical , ` color  dropout ' techniques have been successfully used to find large numbers of normal young galaxies ( without dominant agn ) at redshifts even surpassing those of quasars and radio galaxies ( weymann et al .",
    "1998 ; hu et al .  1999 ) , the radio and near  infrared selection technique has the additional advantage that it is unbiased with respect to the amount of dust extinction .",
    "hyzrgs are therefore also important laboratories for studying the large amounts of dust ( e.g. ,  ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) and molecular gas ( papadopoulos et al .  1999 ) , which are observed to accompany the formation of the first forming massive galaxies .",
    "indeed , a significant part of the scientific rationale for building future large mm - arrays is based on the expectation that to understand galaxy formation will ultimately require understanding of their cold gas and dusty environments .    finally , it has been claimed that the ( co  moving ) space densities of the most powerful radio galaxies and quasars were much hyer near @xmath11 , but that they drop off precipitously at even hyer redshifts ( dunlop and peacock 1990 ; shaver et al .",
    "however , using recently completed studies of moderately faint radio galaxies jarvis et al .",
    "( 1999 ; these proceedings ) have argued that here is _ no _ such evidence for a redshift cut  off and that these previous results have been biased due to unknown radio k",
    " correction ( radio spectral index ) trends and associated selection effects .    for all these reasons",
    "hyzrgs have become very useful probes of the early universe .",
    "unfortunately in complete , flux ",
    "limited samples the vast majority of the sources will be relatively nearby , or at only modest hy redshifts . however , by employing the well - known ` red radio color ' selection technique and choosing sources with ultra ",
    "steep radio spectra one can bypass most of the ` local ' radio source population and efficiently identify radio galaxies at extremely hy redshift .",

    "our largest , and most complete sample is based on the wenss survey at @xmath25@xmath13 , together with the nvss and first surveys . in the remaining area covered by the northern hemisphere radio telescopes",
    ", we used the texas survey at low frequencies , which produces a similar sample but at a higher flux density and is less complete .",
    "we also used two southern surveys to construct the first uss sample in the deep southern sky .",
    "more details about the samples are given in de breuck et al .",
    "( 2000@xmath26 ) .",
    "during the course of our optical and near  ir imaging and optical spectroscopy programs we have fine  tuned our selection technique .",
    "previously it had been found that the identification fraction of radio galaxies decreases with spectral index ( tielens et al .",
    "1979 ; rttgering et al .  1995 ) , which provided the rationale for using the uss source selection technique . with our ` hyper - steep ' radio spectrum selection ( @xmath24 ) most sources remain unidentified , at least on the poss ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "only @xmath19 15% of the sources can be identified , usually with bright galaxy clusters , as indicated by the frequent overdensity of galaxies around them , and by x - ray detections ( de breuck et al .",
    "2000@xmath26 ) .",
    "this identification fraction appears to be independent of spectral index ( fig .",
    "3 ) , in support of the idea that these are mostly foreground objects .",
    "this also explained why our initial optical imaging campaign on 3m4m  class telescopes ( @xmath28 ) was not very succesful in finding @xmath29band identifications . furthermore , for the typically expected @xmath30 values of hyzrgs , it would even be a challenge to detect most hyzrgs in the near  ir at lick observatory .",
    "we therefore decided to entirely skip the optical identification program and go straight to near  ir imaging at the keck i telescope .",
    "this has produced , to date , a 100% identification rate with good photometric magnitudes to select hyzrg candidates using the hubble @xmath3 diagram ( fig .",
    "we have now spectroscopically observed 30 faint uss hyzrg candidates with the following results .",
    "only 5 of the sources have @xmath31 , 7 have @xmath32 , 7 have @xmath33 and 2 sources have @xmath34 , including one at @xmath35 .",
    "at least 3 sources failed to yield redshifts , and were not detected in the continuum , despite @xmath19 1 hr integrations with lris , and may be at record hy redshifts , or are extremely obscured .",
    "we also found 6 sources with only a continuum detection and no emission  lines .",
    "these were all extremely compact uss sources , and may be moderately hy redshift ( @xmath36 ) bl lac objects , ` emission  line free quasars ' ( c.f .",
    ",  fan et al .",

    "simple stellar evolution models are shown for comparison . despite the enormous @xmath39correction effect ( from @xmath40 at @xmath38 to @xmath41 at @xmath42 ) and strong morphological evolution ( from radio  aligned to elliptical structures )",
    ", the @xmath3 diagram remains a powerful phenomenological tool for finding radio galaxies at extremely hy redshifts .",
    "deviations from the @xmath3 relationship may exist ( eales et al .",
    "1997 ; but see mccarthy 1999 ) , and scatter in the @xmath3 values appears to increase with redshift , but this may in part be caused by limited signal - to - noise or emission  line contamination .",
