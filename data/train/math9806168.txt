    "the landweber ",
    "novikov algebra @xmath0 was introduced in the 1960s as an algebra of cohomology operations in complex cobordism theory , and was subsequently described by buchstaber and shokurov @xcite in terms of differential operators on a certain algebraic group .",
    "more recently , both @xmath0 and its integral dual @xmath1 have been studied from alternative viewpoints @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , reflecting the growth in popularity of hopf algebras throughout mathematics .",
    "nevertheless , the interpretations have remained predominately algebraic , although the underlying motivations have ranged from theoretical physics to combinatorics .",
    "our purpose here is to provide a purely geometric description of @xmath1 , incorporating its structure maps and certain left and right actions by @xmath0 ; the importance of the latter is their contribution to the adjoint action , which figures prominently in the construction of the quantum ( or drinfeld ) double @xmath3 .",
    "we work in the context of double complex cobordism , whose properties we have developed in a preliminary article @xcite .",
    "so far as we are aware , double cobordism theories first appeared in @xcite , and in the associated work @xcite . to emphasize our geometric intent we return to the notation of the 60s , and write bordism and cobordism functors as @xmath4 and @xmath5 throughout .",
    "the realizations we seek are provided by a family of bounded flag manifolds with various double @xmath6structures .",
    "these manifolds were originally constructed by bott and samelson @xcite without reference to flags or @xmath6structures , and were introduced into complex cobordism theory in @xcite .",
    "we consider their algebraic topology in detail , describing computations in bordism and cobordism theory which provide the essential link with the landweber ",
    "novikov algebra , and are related to the generalized schubert calculus of bressler and evens @xcite .",
    "these results appear to be of independent interest and extend to the topological study of other toric manifolds @xcite , @xcite , as well as being related to magyar s program @xcite for the description of arbitrary bott ",
    "samelson varieties in combinatorial terms .",
    "we hope to record such extensions in a future work .    for readers who seek background information in algebra , combinatorics , and geometry , we suggest the classic books by kassel @xcite , aigner @xcite , and griffiths and harris @xcite respectively .",
    "we begin in  [ dococo ] by summarizing prerequisites and notation connected with double complex cobordism , recalling the coefficient ring @xmath7 and its subalgebra @xmath8 , together with the canonical isomorphism which identifies them with the hopf algebroid @xmath9 and its sub - hopf algebra @xmath1 respectively . in  [ boflma ]",
    "we study the geometry and topology of the bounded flag manifolds @xmath10 , describing their toric structure and introducing the posets of subvarieties @xmath11 which serve to desingularize their cells . in  [ nostdu ]",
    "we define the basic @xmath6 and double @xmath6structures on @xmath11 which underlie the geometrical realization of @xmath8 , and use them to compute @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; the methods extend to double cobordism , although several aspects of duality demand extra care .",
    "we apply this material in  [ ap ] to calculate @xmath7theory characteristic numbers of the @xmath11 , interpreting the results by means of the calculus of  [ boflma ] . under the canonical isomorphism ,",
    "realizations of the relevant structure maps for @xmath0 and @xmath1 follow immediately .",
    "we use the following notation and conventions without further comment .    given a complex @xmath14plane bundle @xmath15 over a finite cw complex , we let @xmath16 denote the complementary @xmath17plane bundle in some suitably high - dimensional trivial bundle @xmath18 .    we write @xmath19 for the algebra of complex cobordism operations , and @xmath20 for its continuous dual @xmath21 , forcing us in turn to write @xmath0 for the graded landweber ",
    "novikov algebra , and @xmath1 for its dual @xmath22 ; neither of these notations is entirely standard .",
    "several of our algebras are polynomial in variables such as @xmath23 of grading @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the identity . an additive basis is therefore given by monomials of the form @xmath26 , which we denote by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the sequence of nonnegative , eventually zero integers @xmath29 .",
    "the set of all such sequences forms an additive semigroup , and @xmath30 . given any @xmath28 ,",
    "we write @xmath31 for @xmath32 , which is the grading of @xmath27 .",
    "we distinguish the sequences @xmath33 , which have a single nonzero element 1 and are defined by @xmath34 for each integer @xmath35 .",
    "it is often convenient to abbreviate the formal sum @xmath36 to @xmath37 , and write @xmath38 for the component of the @xmath39th power of @xmath37 in grading @xmath24 ; negative values of @xmath39 are permissible .",
    "when dualizing , we choose dual basis elements of the form @xmath40 , defined by @xmath41 ; this notation is designed to be consistent with our convention on gradings , and to emphasize that the elements @xmath40 are not necessarily monomials themselves .",
    "the authors are indebted to many colleagues for enjoyable and stimulating discussions which have contributed to this work .",
    "these include andrew baker , sara billey , francis clarke , fred cohen , sergei fomin , sergei gelfand , christian lenart , peter magyar , haynes miller , jack morava , sergei novikov , and neil strickland .",
    "in this section we summarize the appropriate parts of @xcite , concerning the notation and conventions of double complex cobordism , and operations and cooperations in the corresponding homology and cohomology theories .",
    "double complex cobordism is based on manifolds @xmath42 whose stable normal bundles are equipped with a splitting of the form @xmath43 .",
    "we refer to an equivalence class of such splittings as a _ double @xmath6structure _ @xmath44 on @xmath42 , writing @xmath45 if the manifold requires emphasis .",
    "it is helpful to think of @xmath46 and @xmath47 as the _ left _ and _ right normal bundles _ of the structure , respectively .",
    "we may follow stong @xcite and quillen @xcite in setting up the corresponding bordism and cobordism functors geometrically , taking necessary care with the double indexing inherent in the splitting .",
    "cartesian product ensures that @xmath48 is a graded ring for any space or spectrum @xmath49 .",
    "both functors admit an involution @xmath50 induced by interchanging the order of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and we find it convenient to write @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the coefficient ring @xmath7 is the _",
    "double complex cobordism ring_.    we may recombine the left and right normal bundles to obtain a forgetful homomorphism @xmath53 ; conversely , we may interpret any standard @xmath6structure as either of the double @xmath6structures @xmath54 or @xmath55 , thereby inducing multiplicative natural transformations @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which are interchanged by @xmath50 .",
    "all these transformations have cohomological counterparts , and the compositions @xmath58 and @xmath59 reduce to the identity .",
    "given an element @xmath60 of @xmath61 or @xmath62 , we write @xmath63 and @xmath64 as @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively",
    ".    from the homotopy theoretic viewpoint , it is convenient to work in any of the currently fashionable categories which admit well - behaved smash products ; a coordinate - free approach suffices , as described in @xcite , for example .",
    "the pontryagin ",
    "thom construction then ensures that the double complex bordism and cobordism functors are represented by the thom spectrum @xmath67 , which we label as @xmath68 , and the cobordism ring @xmath7 is identified with the homotopy ring @xmath69 .",
    "the transformation @xmath70 is induced by the product map on @xmath71 , whilst @xmath56 and @xmath72 are induced by the left and right inclusion of @xmath71 in @xmath68 respectively , using the unit @xmath73 on the opposite factor .",
    "we may also identify the homotopy ring of @xmath67 with the @xmath74algebra @xmath75 , adopting the convention of @xcite ( and most subsequent authors ) in taking the argument as the second factor .",
    "of course , @xmath75 is also the hopf algebroid @xmath9 of cooperations in complex bordism theory .",
    "the thom isomorphism @xmath76 provides a further description , whose ring structure is induced by the whitney sum map on the grassmannian @xmath77 ; it is commonly used to transfer the standard polynomial generator @xmath78 in @xmath79 to the polynomial generator @xmath80 in @xmath81 , for each @xmath82 .",
    "monomials @xmath83 in the @xmath78 are dual to the universal chern classes @xmath40 in @xmath84 , and monomials @xmath27 in the @xmath80 are dual to the landweber ",

    "we combine our isomorphisms as @xmath89 referring to the first as the _ canonical isomorphism _ , and to the composition as @xmath90 .",
    "an analysis of the pontryagin ",
    "thom construction confirms that @xmath90 maps the double cobordism class of any @xmath45 to the cobordism class of the singular @xmath6manifold @xmath91 .",

    "we obtain mutually inverse expansions @xmath103 in @xmath94 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 lie in @xmath106 for all @xmath39 and are interchanged by the involution @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath107 they are annihilated by the transformation @xmath70 , whilst @xmath108 . as documented in @xcite , the image of @xmath104 under the canonical isomorphism",
    "is @xmath80 , and the isomorphism @xmath90 of therefore satisfies @xmath109 in @xmath110 , for each @xmath82 .",
    "these observations arise from minor manipulations with the definitions , and suggest that we introduce the polynomial subalgebra @xmath8 of @xmath7 , generated by the elements @xmath104 ( or , equivalently , by the elements @xmath105 ) for @xmath82 .",
    "we may then incorporate our previous remarks and formulate the geometric viewpoint ; we also appeal to @xcite , recalling the construction of singular manifolds @xmath111 to represent @xmath78 in @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is an iterated @xmath114sphere bundle which admits a bounding @xmath6structure for each @xmath82 .",

    "equivalently , we may write @xmath121 where @xmath122 , confirming that either of the left or right actions determines ( and is determined by ) the coproduct @xmath88 .",

    "since @xmath0 is cocommutative , the image of the coproduct @xmath136 defines a third subalgebra @xmath137 of @xmath129 .",
    "the canonical isomorphism identifies the resulting _ diagonal action _ of @xmath137 on @xmath8 with the _ adjoint action _ of @xmath0 on @xmath1 ; this is fundamental to the formation of the quantum double @xmath3 @xcite , and underlies the description of @xmath3 as a subalgebra of @xmath129 @xcite , @xcite .    by analogy with standard cobordism theory",
