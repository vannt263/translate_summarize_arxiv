    "variational problems arise from many areas of science and engineering and have a natural formulation with which the governing equation can be derived through minimization .",
    "often , a variational problem can be transformed into a boundary value problem of partial differential equations ( pdes ) and solved by methods specially designed for pdes .",
    "unfortunately , these methods are not designed to take structural advantage of variational problems and many researches argue that the variational formulation should be used as a natural optimality criterion for mesh adaptation ; e.g. , see @xcite . in this article , we consider mesh adaptation based on the variational formulation .",
    "most of the existing work for the adaptive numerical solution of variational problems employs isotropic mesh adaptation where the size of mesh elements varies from place to place according to a certain local error estimate while their shape is kept close to equilateral . on the other hand , the ability to allow the size , shape and orientation of mesh elements to vary can significantly improve the accuracy of the solution and enhance the computational efficiency ; this is especially true for problems exhibiting distinct anisotropic features .",
    "while it has attracted considerable attention from many researchers and been successfully applied to the numerical solution of pdes , anisotropic mesh adaptation has rarely been employed for variational problems , especially when combined with a  posteriori error estimates .    the objective of this article is to investigate the application of a hierarchical basis a  posteriori error estimator ( hbee ) to anisotropic mesh adaptation for variational problems .",
    "we use the _ @xmath0-uniform mesh _",
    "approach @xcite where an adaptive mesh is generated as a uniform mesh in the metric specified by a symmetric and strictly positive definite tensor , @xmath0 .",
    "the key to the success of the approach is to define a proper metric tensor .",
    "recently , huang and li @xcite developed a metric tensor for the adaptive finite element solution of variational problems . in the anisotropic case , @xmath0 is semi - a  posteriori : it involves residual and edge jumps , both dependent on the computed solution , and the hessian of the exact solution , which provides necessary directional information for anisotropic mesh adaptation and is typically approximated using a hessian recovery technique @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an hbee was used by huang et al . @xcite to develop a metric tensor for the adaptive finite element solution of the boundary value problem of a second - order elliptic differential equation . in this paper",
    "we combine the approaches in @xcite and develop a metric tensor for variational problems based on an hbee and the underlying variational formulation .",
    "the obtained metric tensor is a  posteriori in the sense that it is based solely on residual , edge jumps , and an a  posteriori error estimate .",
    "this is in contrast to most previous work where @xmath0 depends on the hessian of the exact solution and is semi - a  posteriori or completely a  priori ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "numerical results show that the new metric tensor works well for all numerical examples and is comparable in performance with those based on hessian recovery .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : fe - approximation ] is devoted to the description of a general variational problem , its finite element approximation , and the general procedure of the @xmath0-uniform mesh approach for mesh adaptation . in section  [ sec : hbee ] , a bound is derived for the variation of the underlying functional .",
    "it involves residual , edge jumps , and an hbee and is minimized on @xmath0-uniform meshes for an optimal @xmath0 .",

    "other boundary conditions can be either converted to the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition @xcite or treated without major modifications .",

    "we also assume that a linearization of the first variation of the functional ( i.e. @xmath10 $ ] , see below ) is convex around the solution of the minimization problem .",
    "the latter is needed for the error problem defined in section  [ ssec : hbee ] to have a unique solution and for its gau - seidel solution to converge .",
    "however , we do not assume that @xmath9 is quadratic although some theoretical analysis in this paper is valid only for convex quadratic functionals .",
    "a necessary condition for @xmath11 to be a minimizer is that the first variation of the functional vanishes .",

    "[ fig : tanh ] ) provides much better mesh alignment with the boundary layer and the shock wave front than isotropic adaptation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tanh : iso ] ) .",
    "once again , it shows that anisotropic adaptation is advantageous and should be favored for such problems .",
    "meshes and the solution errors obtained with anisotropic adaptation are very similar . moreover ,",
    "mesh adaptation by means of the variational formulation and hbee is comparable with those obtained with both the hessian recovery - based method in @xcite and the pde hbee method in @xcite .",
    "one may observe that the pde hbee method produces a slightly smaller error .",
    "the reason for this behaviour can be attributed to the use of the residual and the edge jump in the metric tensor based on the variational formulation : it can be seen as a data smoothing , which prevents the sharp change of the element aspect ratio .",
    "the effect can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanh ] : the maximum aspect ratio for the metric tensor based on the residual and hbee is 33 ( fig .",

    "they all have correct mesh concentration , but the anisotropic metric tensors ( figs .  [",
    "fig : nonlinearexample : qls ] and [ fig : nonlinearexample : hb ] ) provide a much better alignment with the boundary layers .",
    "again , both anisotropic meshes are comparable , although mesh elements near the boundary layer in the hbee - based adaptive mesh have a larger aspect ratio than elements of the mesh obtained by means of the hessian recovery .",
    "this could be due to the smoothing nature of the hessian recovery : usually , it operates on a larger patch , thus introducing an additional smoothing effect , which affects the grading of the elements size and orientation .",

    "again , the hbee - based mesh has a slightly larger maximum aspect ratio .",
    "numerical results confirm the conclusion of @xcite that a global hbee can be a successful alternative to hessian recovery in mesh adaptation ; a fast approximate solution of the global error problem is sufficient to provide directional information for anisotropic mesh adaptation .",
    "they also confirm the conjecture that good mesh adaptation does not require a convergent hessian recovery or an accurate error estimator , but rather some additional information of global nature , although it is still unclear which information exactly is necessary for successful anisotropic adaptation",
    ".    for quadratic functionals , numerical results suggest that algorithms which involve non - directional information such as residual sometime can be slightly disadvantageous for problems with sharp anisotropic features . such algorithms can smooth out the metric tensor and therefore prevent the rapid change of element size and orientation , which is highly desired for this class of problems .",
    "also , as mentioned in @xcite , hessian recovery could result in unnecessarily high mesh density for problems with discontinuities .",
    "global hierarchical error estimation seems less affected by these issues and , depending on the underlying problem , can provide a more robust solution .    *",
