    "the primary goal of the research we present here has been to use computational electrodynamics methods to choose the best mixing rule for different materials ( dielectric , semiconductor and metal ) of inclusions in dielectric matrix .",
    "light scattering computation for composite particles can be made using the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) .",
    "@xcite applied this method to calculate extinction and scattering efficiencies for silicate sphere with embedded graphite inclusions and evaluated interstellar extinction .",
    "@xcite tested the programs ddscat by @xcite and marcodes by @xcite .",
    "the program by @xcite is much faster than the one by @xcite which is very time consuming , however , it is ment to be used mainly for calculating the extinction by sparse clusters , whereas for compact clusters the accuracy of this method is very low .",
    "for this reason the dda methods are not used for mass study of inter- or circumstellar extinction .",
    "this is why , many researchers still consider various models of grains such as host material in which other materials are embedded ( for example @xcite or @xcite ) or core - mantle ( @xcite ) and multilayer spherical particles ( @xcite ) . besides , the use of a particular model compared to observations can provide information about the inhomogeneous grains .",
    "@xcite computed cross section of extinction using : 1@xmath6 dda method assuming cubic lattice with elementary cell treated as inclusion of 10   for spherical grain of radius 100   and 2@xmath6 mie theory for grain with the same radius .",
    "they considered two mixtures : first a matrix of silicate with complex index of refraction proposed by @xcite and inclusions of thaolin ( organic dielectric with imaginary part of refractive index @xmath7 ) and the second case adesite containing inclusions of water ice .",
    "both cases concern only a mixture of dielectrics for two values of volume fraction of inclusions in the infrared region . in their paper",
    "the effective optical constants applied to the mie theory were obtained from the most popular rules in astrophysics : maxwell - garnett s and bruggeman s .",
    "@xcite compared cross sections of extinction obtained by both methods and stated that the application of effective - medium theories ( emt ) to the problem of light scattering by inhomogeneous grains is not straightforward .",
    "other authors ( e.g. @xcite ) compared the dda with emt method but only for very limited range of volume fractions of inclusions , wavelengths and materials .",
    "we limited our study to the grains without electric charge , magnetic suspectibility and considered only two component mixtures where inclusions were monodisperse .",
    "in our investigation we tested six mixing rules , not only the most popular in astrophysics such as maxwell - garnett s and bruggeman s .",
    "the considered mixing rules are presented below .",
    "the maxwell - garnett s @xcite mixing rule , originally , has been applied to metal particles encapsuled in an insulating matrix and for small filling factors , now it is used without restriction .",
    "the following equation is known as the maxwell - garnett formula @xcite : @xmath8 for composite media consisting of spherical particles of both basic components without the requirement of complete encapsulation @xcite has established the following equation @xcite : @xmath9 the bruggeman s equation is symmetrical , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be exchanged .",
    "similar equation , but not for spherical inclusions was derived by @xcite for conductivity of metallic mixtures .    for spherical inclusions and random oriented ellipsoids @xcite and later , along a different way",
    ", @xcite have found the following relation : @xmath12 the hanai - bruggeman equation was originally derived by @xcite for composite dielectric consisting of a host material with spherical inclusions .",
    "hanai in 1961 modified the bruggeman s equation and generalised it for complex dielectric permittivities .",
    "the hanai - bruggeman equation is following ( eq.3.58 in @xcite ) : @xmath13 other mixing law for homogeneous and isotropic systems has been obtained by @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic mixing rule for a mixture of two components has the form of : @xmath14 @xcite reconsidered rayleigh s derivation for a cubical array of spheres @xmath10 enclosed in a medium @xmath15 and obtained an equation that appears to be more satisfactory at high values of @xmath16 .",
    "the following equation describes improved rayleigh s mixing rule @xcite : @xmath17 in all formulas @xmath16 is the volume fraction of inclusions and @xmath18 - the complex dielectric permittivity of a matrix and inclusion , respectively .",
    "the @xmath19 ( without a subscript ) is the complex dielectric permittivity of the mixture .",
    "generally the applicability of all mixing rules is restricted to low concentration of inclusions . in this paper",
    "we have extended the search for the best mixing rule up to 50% of concentration of inclusions .",
    "we examined three different cases of the refractive index for inclusions @xmath20 .",
    "the chosen refractive indices of inclusions refer to those of materials examined by @xcite .",
    "the matrix in all cases was dielectric with refractive index @xmath21 . because the refractive indices are not additive quantities they",
    "have been changed into complex permittivity relative to free space using the following formulae : @xmath22 and @xmath23 where : @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real and imaginary parts of complex refractive index , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real and imaginary parts of complex permittivity .",
    "next , we have calculated the complex permittivities for the mixture based on the above mixing rules .",
    "the computation has been carried out for volume fractions in the range from 0% to 50% with 5% step .",
    "the obtained complex permittivities have been changed into complex refractive indices using the following relations : @xmath28 and @xmath29    the extinction coefficients have been computed using the discrete dipole approximation , first proposed by @xcite .",
    "dda methods divide the particle into numerous polarizable elements of volume .",
    "the induced dipole polarizations in these cubes are determined self - consistently , then properties such as the extinction cross section are determined in terms of the induced polarization . in our study , @xcite approach is used to compute the efficiency factor for extinction .",
    "the refraction indices for each kind of mixture and all considered mixing rules were calculated using the fortran routine ddscat.5a10 given by @xcite .",
    "the efficiency factors for extinction @xmath30 for homogeneous spherical grains ( each element of dda array has the same refractive index calculated for the mixture ) have been computed for the following wavelengths : @xmath31 and grains with radius @xmath32 containing 1791 dipoles .",
    "the location of dipoles in the array for such pseudospherical particle has been obtained using the routine _",
    "calltarget.f _ also made available by @xcite .",
    "the subscript p in the symbol @xmath30 corresponds to the appropriate mixing rule , j - the volume fraction of inclusion and the subscript l corresponds to wavelength .",
    "the determined efficiency factors for extinction have been compared to those computed with the exact mie theory .",
    "it has been found that the differences between the two methods are very small similar to @xcite results .",
    "we have applied a mixture of dda elements with different refractive indices while the ratio of number of dda elements with refractive index of inclusion to all elements in the grain equals the volume fraction of inclusion .",
    "the assumed size of inclusion equals the volume of the dda element ( the size of inclusion can not be smaller than the element volume considered in dda approximation ) .",
    "@xcite considered how surface granularity affects the accuracy of calculations . in our study validity criteria considered by @xcite",
    "are satisfied and furthermore the influence of surface granularity is reduced because it is almost the same in both cases : for elements with mixture of materials and for random mixture of elements with two kinds of materials .",
    "similarly , the departure from sphericity for both pseudospheres is the same and does not influence the difference of extinction in both cases .",
    "the arrangement of inclusions ( dda elements ) is random . in order to obtain random number of dda elements in the discrete dipole arrays we have used random number generator `` research randomizer '' available at _ http://www.randomizer.org_. we have generated 10 series of numbers corresponding to the given volume fractions of inclusions out of all 1791 dipoles .",
    "the generated numbers have been sorted in ascending order .",
    "the location of dipoles in the array for the spherical particle obtained from the routine _",
    "calltarget.f _ was the same as for homogeneous grains with the only difference that for the randomly generated numbers the dda elements had the refractive index of inclusions and for the others the refractive index of a matrix .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents the dependence of efficiency factors for extinction on the volume fraction for inclusions with regular and random locations .",
    "one can see from this figure that the geometrical structure of inhomogeneous grain plays a very important role .",
    "authors of the considered mixing rules have assumed a statistical distribution of inclusions .",
    "therefore , in our calculations the random distributions have been used . because there is a scattering of results for different random distributions the efficiency factors for extinction",
    "have been calculated for 10 different distributions and then averaged .",
    "the dependence curves of extinction on volume fractions of inclusions have been interpolated by 5th degree polynomials . for grains with radii of @xmath33 10 values of efficiency factors for extinction @xmath34 depending on random location",
    "have been calculated for each of 4 wavelengths @xmath35=0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 and 5.0 @xmath3 by using the computer program ddscat.5a10 .",
    "the subscript i in the symbol @xmath34 corresponds to the number of random location of inclusions , j - the volume fraction of inclusion and the subscript l corresponds to wavelength .",

    "the goodness - of - fit of the extinction curve for each mixing rule strongly depends on the wavelength . for @xmath61",
    "the best fit has been obtained for the lichtenecker rule . however , for the whole range of wavelengths the hanai rule gives the best fit for this material .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the value of the fitting coefficient @xmath60 is very small .",
    "it may be necessary to investigate other mixing rules in order to obtain a better fit ; 3 .   for a high volume factor of inclusions",
    "they may be placed so close that , on one hand , they may create inclusions of much bigger sizes and therefore more vulnerable to skin effect , on the other hand they may exceed the percolation threshold .",

    "considering the above results it is possible that different mixing rules should be applied for the same mixture of materials for different wavelengths , especially with higher volume fractions of inclusions . in spite of their deficiencies like simplifying idealisations",
    "while deriving them or basing only upon experiments , the mixing rules are able to provide important information about the inhomogeneous materials . in astrophysics generally",
