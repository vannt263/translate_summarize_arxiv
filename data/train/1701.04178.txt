    "the dense neutron star(ns ) matter shows us an interesting subject to study the properties of nucleon matter with the density higher than nuclear saturation density @xmath3 .",
    "there , it has pointed that the various new degrees of freedom , such as hyperons , quarks and their mixed phases , realize according to the density@xcite .",
    "it is well known that ns matter has the properties of the strong degeneracy and exists the attractive interaction between two baryons , which are the conditions for the occurrence of superfluid states in fermi systems .",
    "thus , ns is already considered as the key laboratories of various superfluidity in nuclear matter@xcite . in recent years",
    ", many studies have been focussing on @xmath0 protonic superfluidity .",
    "since the protonic superfluid states as well as their pairing strength can greatly suppress the neutrino processes involving nucleons about @xmath4 years of ns cooling phases , affect the properties of rotating dynamics , post - glitch timing observations and possible vertex pinning of nss@xcite .",
    "the possibility of protonic superfluid states in ns matter is first suggested by migdal in 1960@xcite .",
    "the interaction between two protons is the combination of strong repulsive short - range interaction and weaker attractive long - range interaction . in proton matter ,",
    "when the interparticle distance is much larger than the range of the repulsive interaction , protons will condense into superfluid states due to the attractive interaction .",
    "for the size of @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap , the calculations based on the microscopic theory have already carried out a great amount of work .",
    "all the numerical calculations yield qualitatively similar ranges for the appearance of @xmath0 protonic pairing .",
    "however , obtaining the exact numerical results for @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap and evaluating its quantitative influence on ns have been proved to be a hard problem , which is due to that there are many uncertainties about the proton - proton(pp ) interactions in ns matter , methods of approximation , paucity of experimental data in extreme conditions and so on . during this period , lots of researches of ns",
    "have been performed adopting various frameworks .",
    "currently , many relativistic models call attention in researches on ns since they are well suited to describe ns in accord with the special relativity .",
    "the most commonly used among them is the relativistic mean field(rmf ) model , extremely successful in nuclear matter studies@xcite .",
    "this article mainly does the following work .",
    "we study ns matter for two cases : ( i)ns is made up of neutron , proton , electron and muon only ( npe@xmath5 ) , ( ii)ns is composed of nucleons , hyperons(@xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , electron and muon ( nphe@xmath5 ) .",
    "our model excludes @xmath8 hyperons on account of the remaining uncertainty of the form of @xmath8 potential in nuclear matter at the saturation density@xcite .",
    "we use the rmf theory to describe the properties of ns .",
    "the @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap is calculated by the reid soft core(rsc ) potential@xcite .",
    "we mainly focus on the influence of hyperon degrees of freedom on @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap in ns matter .",
    "in the rmf theory , baryonic interactions are described by the exchanged mesons including isoscalar scalar and vector mesons @xmath9 and @xmath10 , an isovector vector meson @xmath11 , two additional strange mesons @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the total lagrangian density of ns matter is@xcite , @xmath14\\psi_b   + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu\\sigma\\partial^\\mu\\sigma - m_\\sigma^2\\sigma^2)-\\frac{1}{3}a \\sigma   ^{3}\\\\   -\\frac{1}{4}b \\sigma^4     + \\frac{1}{2}m_\\omega^2    \\omega_\\mu\\omega^\\mu+\\frac{1}{4}c_3(\\omega_\\mu\\omega^\\mu)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_\\rho^2{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}_\\mu{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}^\\mu -\\frac{1}{4}f^{\\mu v}f_{\\mu v}\\\\-\\frac{1}{4}g^{\\mu v}g_{\\mu v}+ + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_v\\sigma^*\\partial^v\\sigma^*-m^2_{\\sigma^*}\\sigma^{*2 } ) -\\frac{1}{4}s^{\\mu v}s_{\\mu v}\\\\+\\frac{1}{2}m^2_{\\phi}\\phi_\\mu\\phi^\\mu+\\sum_l\\overline{\\psi}_l[i\\gamma_\\mu\\partial^\\mu - m_l]\\psi_l.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here the field tensors of the vector mesons , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are denoted by @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the meson fields are seen as classical fields and field operators are instead of their expectation values in the rmf approximation .",
    "the field equations derived from the lagrange function are @xmath17 here @xmath18 denotes baryonic isospin projection . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are baryonic scalar and vector densities , respectively .",
    "they have the following form , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is baryonic spin projection , @xmath23 is baryonic fermi momentum , @xmath24 is baryonic effective mass .    for ns matter consisting of n , p , @xmath6 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , e , @xmath5 , the charge neutrality condition is given by @xmath27 the @xmath28 equilibrium conditions are expressed as @xmath29    at zero temperature the chemical potential of baryon and lepton are written by @xmath30    the @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap @xmath31 can be obtained by solving the bcs gap equation , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is protonic single particle energy . for the pp interaction ,",
    "we adopt the rsc potential which is well suited for applying in ns matter .",
    "@xmath35 is defined the matrix element of @xmath0 component of rsc potential in momentum space ,    @xmath36    here @xmath37 is @xmath0 pp interaction potential in coordinate space . it is expressed in the five - range gaussian and depends on @xmath20 , asymmetry parameter @xmath38 and two - nucleon state @xmath28 and @xmath39 as discussed in refs@xcite , @xmath40    the critical temperature @xmath41 of @xmath0 protonic superfluidity is given by its energy gap @xmath31 at zero temperature approximation@xcite , @xmath42    combining eqs.(1)-(6 ) with the charge neutrality and @xmath28 equilibrium conditions , eqs.(8 ) and ( 9 ) , we can solve the system with a fixed @xmath20 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap @xmath31 and critical temperature @xmath41 can be obtained from eqs.(11)-(14 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the onset of @xmath0 protonic superfluidity is determined by the energy gap function @xmath31 . theoretical calculation of @xmath31 is sensitively dependent on the model of pp interaction and many - body theory adopted . in this paper",
    ", we use the rsc potential as an example to analyze @xmath0 protonic superfluidity in npe@xmath5 and nphe@xmath5 matter , respectively .",
    "we mainly focus on the influence of hyperon degrees of freedom on @xmath0 protonic superfluidity . in order to make the results more clearly , we employ two successful parameter sets of tm1 and tma to calculate separately @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap in ns matter .",
    "the parameter sets are listed in table i and ii . for the vector couplings of hyperons ,",
    "we take the relations derived from su(6 ) quark model(see ref@xcite for details ) , @xmath43    .[tab : table i]the coupling constants of the meson - nucleon of tm1 and tma sets , the masses are unit of mev@xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     up to now , we do not known @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap increase or decrease , if hyperons appear in ns matter . as the uncertainty of the pp interaction ,",
    "we calculate @xmath31 on the basis of the rsc potential .",
    "we concentrate on the influence of hyperon degrees of freedom on @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap in ns matter .",
    "the peak values of @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap @xmath44 and the corresponding critical temperature @xmath45 , baryonic density @xmath20 in npe@xmath5 and nphe@xmath5 matter are listed in table iii , for the tm1 and tma parameter sets .",
    "as shown in table iii , the appearance of hyperons makes @xmath44 and @xmath45 decrease which will inevitably cause the cooling rate of ns changing . in fig.4",
    ", we show @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap @xmath31 as a function of baryonic density @xmath46 in npe@xmath5 and nphe@xmath5 matter , for parameter sets tm1 and tma . as seen from fig.4 , the protonic pairing energy gap @xmath31 as the function of @xmath46 is a typical bell - shaped curve from zero to a maximum value to zero again .",
    "the change of @xmath31 in behavior is due to the reduction of mean interparticle distance . from fig.4 , we also can see that @xmath0 protonic superfluidity appears within the baryonic density range of @xmath20 = 0.0  0.649 ( 0.685 ) @xmath47 and @xmath20 = 0.0  0.953 ( 0.853 ) @xmath47 for parameter sets tm1 ( or tma ) in npe@xmath5 and nphe@xmath5 matter , respectively .",
    "it is clear from these data that the appearance of hyperons makes baryonic density range of @xmath0 protonic superfluidity widen .",
    "such baryonic density ranges can cover or partially cover the cores of nss and are highly relevant to the direct urca processes involving nucleons which play a leading role in ns cooling .",
    "in particular , from fig.4 , the appearance of hyperons also leads to @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap in nphe@xmath5 matter obviously larger than the corresponding values in npe@xmath5 matter when baryonic density @xmath48 0.377 ( 0.409 ) @xmath47 for tm1(or tma ) parameter set ( see the two dots shown in fig.4 ) . according to eq.(14 ) , the critical temperature of @xmath0 protonic superfluidity positively increases which could further suppress the cooling rate of ns .",
    "we study the influence of hyperon degrees of freedom on the size and baryonic density range of @xmath0 protonic paring energy gap by adopting the rmf and bcs theories in ns matter .",
    "it is shown that the appearance of hyperons makes the peak values of @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap and critical temperature decrease . and baryonic density range of existing @xmath0 protonic superfluidity is widen from 0.0  0.649 ( 0.685 ) @xmath47 in npe@xmath5 matter to 0.0  0.953(0.853)@xmath47 for tm1 ( or tma ) parameter sets in nphe@xmath5 matter .",
    "in addition , when the baryonic density @xmath48 0.377 ( 0.409 ) @xmath47 for tm1(or tma ) parameter set , the appearance of hyperons leads to @xmath0 protonic pairing energy gap obviously larger than the corresponding values in npe@xmath5 matter which could further suppress the cooling rate of nss . in our results , the appearance of hyperons in ns matter not only changes the eos and bulk properties but also changes the properties of @xmath0 protonic superfluidity .",
