    "despite their different mathematical structures the analogy between gravitation and electromagnetism has proven to be fruitful .",
    "this analogy is particularly useful in the case of gravitation when we try to relate our 3-dimensional physical intuition and experience on the one hand with the 4-dimensional spacetime events on the other hand .",
    "it is clear that achiveing this goal requires some sort of splitting of spacetime to space and time components . in this letter",
    "we will use this analogy and in particular the quasi - maxwell form of the vacuum einstein equations to find a solution which corresponds to the presence of a line gravomagnetic monopole .. ] in what follows we will use the @xmath0 or the threading formulation ( splitting ) of spacetimes in general relativity introduced by landau and lifshitz [ 6 ] . in this formulation",
    "the fundamental geometrical objects used for splitting spacetime are timelike worldlines ( threads ) and so the formalism is best suited to treating stationary gravitational fields which are characterized by the existence of a timelike killing vector .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is the 4-dimensional manifold of a stationary spacetime with metric @xmath2 and @xmath3 , then one can show that there is a 3-dimensional manifold @xmath4 defined invariantly by the smooth map [ 1,3 ] @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the orbit of the timelike killing vector @xmath7 passing through @xmath8 .",
    "the 3-space @xmath4 along with the 3-dimensional metric @xmath9 ( defined on @xmath10 ) is called the factor space @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the 1-dimensional group of transformations generated by @xmath7 .",
    "one can use @xmath9 to define differential operators on @xmath4 in the same way that @xmath2 defines differential operators on @xmath1 .",
    "for example the covariant derivative of a 3-vector @xmath13 is defined as follows @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the 3-dimensional christoffel symbol cosntructed from the components of @xmath9 in the following way @xmath18 it has been shown that the metric of a stationary spacetime can be written in the following form [ 5 ] @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the spatial distance written in terms of the 3-dimensional metric @xmath9 of @xmath4 . using this formulation for a stationary spacetime one can write the vacuum einstein equations in quasi - maxwell form as follows [ 8 ] @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where the gravitational fields are @xmath27",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 is the 3-dimensional ricci tensor constructed from the metric @xmath30 .",
    "note that all operations in these equations are defined in the 3-dimensional space with metric @xmath31 .      before deriving the spacetime representing a line gravomagnetic monopole",
    ", a simple consideration of line magnetic monoploes would be useful .",
    "suppose that a line magnetic monopole is stretched along the @xmath32-axis in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "using gauss s law and cylindrical symmetry the @xmath33 field produced by this monoploe is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35=const .",
    "is the monopole strength per unit length .",
    "this field can be produced either by the potential @xmath36 or by @xmath37 .",
    "the two potentials are related through a gauge transformation @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "later we will find the gravitational analogue of this gauge transformation .",
    "levi - civita s static cylindrically symmetric solutions of the vacuum einstein equations have the following form [ 7 ] @xmath40 \\eqno ( 9)\\]]where @xmath41 is a constant .",
    "this is a flat metric .",
    "also note that ( 9 ) is identical to kasner solution [ 4 ] . ] to find the stationary cylindrically symmetric solution for empty space ( with a radial gravomagnetic field ) , using equations ( 1 ) and ( 9 ) , we take the following cylindrically symmetric form for the spatial metric @xmath42 for cylindrical symmetry with a radial @xmath43 , gauss s law gives @xmath44 where @xmath45=const .",
    "is the gravomagnetic monople strength per unit length . now substituting ( 7 ) and ( 11 ) into ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) we get the following equation for @xmath46 from ( 5a ) @xmath47",
    "while ( 5b ) is satisfied identically . to construct @xmath29 from equation ( 6 )",
    "we need the 3-dimensional christoffel symbols of the metric ( 10 ) which are +   + @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 using the above results and equations @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we find that the surviving components of the field equation are @xmath53and @xmath54 where the prime denotes @xmath55 .",
    "+ now we proceed to solve equations ( 12 ) for @xmath46 and @xmath56 .",
    "equation @xmath57 can be written in the following form @xmath58 in terms of the variable @xmath59 this becomes @xmath60 which on integration gives the following solution @xmath61 } } = { 4 m \\over l}{1 \\over ( { \\rho / c})^{2m}+ ( { \\rho / c})^{-2 m } } \\eqno(13)\\ ] ] substituting this into @xmath62 one finds @xmath63 = a{\\rho^{2b}}{{({\\rho / c})^{2m}+({\\rho / c})^{-2m}}\\over 2}\\eqno(14)\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants . substituting @xmath67 and @xmath68 in @xmath69",
    "one finds that @xmath70 .",

    "one can see that the potential expression @xmath72 @xmath73 will do the job .",
    "so by substituting this potential expression , the full metric becomes    @xmath74\\hfill ( 15a)\\cr}\\ ] ] regaining the static cylindrically symmetric metric as @xmath75 requires that @xmath76 @xmath77    the behaviour of @xmath78 as a function of @xmath79 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "this spacetime is one of the members of the papapetrou class [ 9 ] and has two event horizons , one at @xmath80 and another at @xmath81 .",
    "if we shift the @xmath32 coordinate in ( 15a ) by a constant @xmath66 we have @xmath82 and @xmath83}^2- e^{2\\lambda(\\rho)}(d{\\rho^2}+dz^2)-{\\rho^2}e^{2\\nu(\\rho)}d\\phi^2\\ ] ] where @xmath84 .",
    "but now one can shift the zero point of the time coordinate in the following way @xmath85 so that @xmath86 has the same form as @xmath87 in terms of the new coordinate @xmath88 .",
    "this shows that @xmath87 is translationally invariant along the @xmath32-direction . in other words , although the metric is not from the mathematical point of view cylindrically symmetric ( i.e. not all the components are @xmath32-independent ) , it is so physically .",
    "this is also clear if one represents the spacetime ( 15a ) by its gravoelectric and gravomagnetic fields which are both explicitly cylindrically symmetric .",
    "+ one can equally well choose as the gravomagnetic potential the expression @xmath89 which leads to the same gravomagnetic field @xmath43 .",
    "but the metric becomes @xmath90\\hfill ( 15b)\\cr}\\ ] ] this metric is explicitly cylindrically symmetric but it suffers from multivaluedness .",
    "if we apply the same reasoning as that we used for the metric @xmath87 above , we can associate this multivaluedness with different choices of the zero point of the time coordinate through the following transformation @xmath91 as in the case of the magnetic monopole ( section 1.2 ) the two different choices for the vector potential @xmath13 correspond to the following gauge transformation between them @xmath38 where @xmath92 .",
    "it is already clear that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are killing vectors of @xmath87 however one can see that the form @xmath95 can be reached alternatively by the transformation @xmath96 . now ,",
    "as is obvious from @xmath95 , @xmath97 is a killing vector in the transformed coordinates and upon converting to the previous coordinates we find that @xmath98 is also a killing vector of @xmath99 .",
    "this is a multivalued killing vector whose interpretation might require the consideration of not just the space itself but also the covering space with the many values of @xmath100 unroled .",
    "to find the connection between this metric and some other solutions , we use the ernst formulation of axially symmetric spacetimes . in this formulation",
    "the vacuum field equations , in the weyl s coordinates @xmath101,.\\ ] ] ] can be written in the following form [ 2,5 ] @xmath102where @xmath103 is a complex potential defined as follows @xmath104 every solution of @xmath105 gives a stationary axially symmetric metric .",
    "one can easily see that the metric @xmath87 is a solution of ( 16 ) with @xmath106 and @xmath107 now the following theorems lead us to some other solutions [ 5 ]    @xmath108 .",
    "given a stationary axisymmetric vacuum solution @xmath109 , the substitution @xmath110 @xmath111 yields another vacuum solution @xmath112 .",
    "and the substitution@xmath114 @xmath115 yields a solution @xmath112 of the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "@xmath116 . for a stationary axisymmetric vacuum solution @xmath117 ( in weyl s coordinates ) one obtains a corresponding cylindrically symmetric einstein - maxwell field @xmath118 by the substitution @xmath119 for example applying ( i ) followed by ( iii ) to ( 15a ) ,",
    "one obtains the rahdakrishna metric [ 10 ] , which is a time dependent cylindrically symmetric solution of einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "one can also obtain metric ( 15 ) by applying the gravitational duality rotation ( sometimes called ehlers transformation ) and later developed by geroch [ 3].]to metric ( 9 ) .",
    "this transformation , in its original formulation , states that if @xmath120 is the metric of a static exterior spacetime , then    @xmath121 [ with @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 would be the metric of a stationary exterior spacetime provided that @xmath125 satisfies @xmath126 } \\eqno(18)\\ ] ] where @xmath127 is the flat space alternating symbol . from equations ( 9 ) and ( 15a )",
    "we see that in this case @xmath77",
    "@xmath128 @xmath129 and @xmath130 + it can easily be seen that equations ( 19 ) satisfy ( 18 ) . in the same way the nut metric has been shown to be the gravitational dual of schwarzschild metric [ 3 ] .",
