    "there are several methods for deriving hawking radiation @xcite-@xcite and for calculating its temperature . _",
    "_ the original method considered the creation of a black hole in the context of a collapse geometry , calculating the bogoliubov transformations between the initial and final states of incoming and outgoing radiation .",
    "the more popular method of analytic continuation to a euclidean section ( the wick rotation method ) emerged soon after**. * * relying on the methods of finite - temperature quantum field theory , an analytic continuation @xmath0  of the black hole metric is performed and the periodicity of @xmath1  ( denoted by @xmath2 ) is chosen in order to remove a conical singularity that would otherwise be present at  fixed points of the @xmath3  isometry generated by @xmath4  ( the event horizon in the original lorentzian section ) .  the black hole",
    "is then considered to be in equilibrium with a scalar field that has inverse temperature @xmath2  at infinity .",
    "recently a semi - classical method of modeling hawking radiation as a tunneling effect was proposed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this method  involves calculating the imaginary part of the action for the ( classically forbidden ) process of  s - wave emission across the horizon ( first considered by kraus and wilczek @xcite-@xcite ) , which in turn is related to the boltzmann factor for emission at the hawking temperature . using the wkb approximation the tunneling probability for the classically forbidden trajectory of the s - wave _ _ coming from inside to outside the horizon is given by:@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the classical action of the trajectory to leading order in @xmath7  ( here set equal to unity)@xcite .  expanding the action in terms of the particle energy ,",
    "the hawking temperature is recovered at linear order .  in other words for @xmath8",
    "this gives@xmath9 which is the regular boltzmann factor for a particle of energy @xmath10 where @xmath2 is the inverse temperature of the horizon .",
    "the higher order terms are a self - interaction effect resulting from energy conservation @xcite,@xcite ; however , for calculating the temperature , expansion to linear order is all that is required .",
    "two different methods have been employed to calculate the imaginary part of the action ",
    "one used by parikh and wilczek @xcite  and the other by angheben , nadalini , vanzo , and zerbini @xcite ( which is an extension from the method used by srinivasan and padmanabhan @xcite ) .",
    "the former method considers a null s - wave emitted from the black hole .",
    "based on previous work analyzing the full action in detail @xcite-@xcite , the only part of the action that contributes an imaginary term is @xmath11 , where @xmath12is the momentum of the emitted null s - wave .  then by using hamilton s equation and knowledge of the null geodesics it is possible to calculate the imaginary part of the action .",
    "we will refer to this approach as the null geodesic method .",
    "the latter method involves consideration of an emitted * *  * * scalar particle , ignoring its self - gravitation , and assumes that its action satisfies the relativistic hamilton - jacobi equation . from the symmetries of the metric one picks an appropriate ansatz for the form of the action",
    ".  we will refer to this method as the hamilton - jacobi ansatz .",
    "*  *    in this paper we examine these two methods in the context of a broader class of spacetimes than has previously been studied .",
    "one of our prime motivations is to understand the applicability of the method to stationary black hole spacetimes such as the kerr - newman and taub - nut spacetimes . * *  * * the taub - nut metric is a generalization of the schwarzschild metric and has played an important role in the conceptual development of general relativity and in the construction of brane solutions in string theory and m - theory .",
    "@xcite the nut charge plays the role of a magnetic mass , inducing a topology in the euclidean section at infinity that is a hopf fibration of a circle over a 2-sphere .  a counter example to almost anything  @xcite ,  taub - nut spaces have been of particular interest in recent years because of the role they play in furthering our understanding of the ads - cft correspondence @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . * *  * * along these lines , the thermodynamics of various taub - nut solutions has been a subject of intense study in recent years .",
    "their entropy is not proportional to the area of the event horizon and their free energy can sometimes be negative @xcite,@xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "solutions of einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant @xmath13  and a nonvanishing nut charge have a boundary metric that has closed timelike curves .",
    "the behavior of quantum field theory is significantly different in such spaces , and it is  of interest to understand how ads / cft works in these sorts of cases @xcite .",
    "all such thermodynamic calculations have thus far been carried out in the euclidean section , using wick rotation methods .  for most taub - nut spaces",
    "the lorentzian section has closed timelike curves . as a consequence , determination of the temperature via the original method of hawking  while mathematically clear  is somewhat problematic in terms of its physical interpretation .",
    "it is straightforward enough to analytically continue the time coordinate and various metric parameters to render the metric euclidean .",
    "regularity arguments then yield a periodicity for the time coordinate that can then be interpreted as a temperature .",
    "however the lorentzian analogue of this procedure is less than clear , though it has been established that a relationship between distinct analytic continuation methods exists @xcite .",
    "an independent method of computing the temperature associated with event horizons in nut - charged spacetimes is certainly desirable .",
    "our goal in this paper is to address this question , and to more generally investigate the tunnelling approach outside of the spherically symmetric ansatz . to this end",
    ", we compare the null geodesic method and the hamilton - jacobi ansatz for obtaining the imaginary part of the action .",
    "we then apply these methods to a variety of spacetimes , and derive a general formula for the temperature from this method .",
    "we then consider specific cases of interest , beginning with rindler space and moving on to charged and rotating black hole spacetimes .  turning to taub - nut spaces ,",
    "we obtain a general expression for the temperature for a subclass of taub - nut spacetimes without closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) that we can compare to those obtained via wick rotation methods .",
    "we find agreement in all relevant cases .",
    "our paper is structured as follows .",
    "the next section will outline the two methods , starting with a discussion and generalization of the null geodesic method and followed by a discussion of the hamilton - jacobi ansatz .",
    "we demonstrate that knowledge of the total mass or energy is not essential by showing the direct application of these methods to rindler spacetime .",
    "we then apply these methods to stationary space - times , considering in turn the kerr - newman class of metrics and then taub - nut spacetimes . in each case",
    "we obtain results commensurate with other methods , concentrating in the latter case on the subclass of taub - nut - ads spacetimes that do not have closed timelike curves @xcite .",
    "we finish with a preliminary discussion of issues that occur when applying the method to extremal black holes , concentrating on the specific case of the extremal reissner - nordstrom spacetime .",
    "we begin by reviewing the null geodesic method @xcite .",
    "the general static spherically metric can be written in the form @xmath14 which covers a broad range of black hole metrics .",
    "we want to write it in painlev form @xcite so that there is no singularity at the horizon .",
    "this is easily accomplished via the transformation @xmath15  yielding @xmath16    this coordinate system has a number of interesting features . at any fixed time",
    "the spatial geometry is flat .  at any fixed radius",
    "the boundary geometry is the same as that of the metric ( [ stat1 ] ) .",
    "the radial null geodesics for this metric correspond to @xmath17 where the plus / minus signs correspond to outgoing / ingoing null geodesics .    the basic idea behind this approach is to regard hawking radiation as a quantum tunnelling process .",
    "however unlike other tunnelling processes in which two separated classical turning points are joined by a trajectory in imaginary time , the tunnelling barrier is created by the outgoing particle itself , whose trajectory is from the inside of the black hole to the outside , a classically forbidden process .",
    "the probability of tunnelling is proportional to the exponential of minus twice the imaginary part of the action for this process in the wkb limit .",
    "because of energy conservation , the radius of the black hole shrinks as a function of the energy of the outgoing particle ; in this sense the particle creates its own tunnelling barrier .    in the spherically symmetric case",
    "the emitted particle is taken to be in an outgoing s - wave mode , and so we use the plus sign in ( [ painrad ] ) . at the horizon ( where @xmath18 ) then @xmath19 provided @xmath20 is well defined there .",
    "the imaginary part of the action for an outgoing s - wave from @xmath21 to @xmath22 is expressed as@xmath23 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the respective initial and final radii of the black hole .",
    "the trajectory between these two radii is the barrier the particle must tunnel through .",
    "we assume that the emitted s - wave has energy @xmath24  and that the total energy of the space - time was originally @xmath25 . invoking conservation of energy , to this approximation the s - wave moves in a background spacetime of energy @xmath26 .  in order to evaluate the integral ,",
    "we employ hamilton s equation @xmath27  to switch the integration variable from momentum to energy ( @xmath28 ) , giving@xmath29 where @xmath30  because total energy @xmath31  with @xmath25  constant .",
    "note that @xmath32  is implicitly a function of @xmath33 . for the special cases where this function is known ( eg . schwarzschild ) the integral in eq .",
    "( [ ssint ] ) can be solved exactly in terms of @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "another generalization of the null geodesic method @xcite spacetimes with a well defined adm mass are considered ( since dependence of @xmath33  is explicitly known ) in order to obtain self gravitation effects ; for our considerations self gravitation will be ignored .",
    "in general we can always perform a series expansion in @xmath34  in order to find the temperature . to first order",
    "this gives * *  * * @xmath35 to proceed further we will need to estimate the last integral .",
    "first we note that @xmath36  because the black hole decreases in mass as the s - wave is emitted ; consequently the radius of the event horizon decreases .",
    "we therefore write @xmath37  and @xmath38  where @xmath39  denotes the location of the event horizon of the original background space - time before the emission of particles .",
    "henceforth the notation @xmath40  will be used to denote @xmath39 .",
    "note that with this generalization no explicit knowledge of the total energy or mass is required since @xmath40  is simply the radius of the event horizon before any particles are emitted .",
    "there is a pole at the horizon where @xmath19 . for a non - extremal black hole @xmath41  and @xmath42",
    "are both finite and non - zero at the horizon , so for these cases @xmath43  only has a simple pole at the horizon with a residue of @xmath44 .",
    "hence the imaginary part of the action will be@xmath45    therefore the tunnelling probability is @xmath46 and so the hawking temperature @xmath47is@xmath48    it is easy to confirm that for a schwarzschild black hole the correct result of @xmath49 follows .",
    "situations in which the horizon does not have a simple pole correspond to extremal black holes , and need to be handled separately .",
    "one conceptual issue that arises when applying either the hamilton - jacobi or null geodesic methods to the extremal case is due to the fact that the model is dynamic , so emission of a neutral particle from the black hole implies a naked singularity , in violation of cosmic censorship",
    ".  we will discuss the extremal case in section 4 .",
    "*  *      we next consider an alternate method for calculating the imaginary part of the action making use of the hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite .",
    "we assume that the action of the outgoing particle is given by the classical action @xmath6 that satisfies the relativistic hamilton - jacobi equation@xmath50 to leading order in the energy we can neglect the effects of the self - gravitation of the particle .    for a metric of the form@xmath51 the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ hjac ] )",
    "is @xmath52 there exists a solution of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 and that the @xmath55 s are constant .",
    "solving for @xmath56 yields@xmath57 ( for an outgoing particle ) and the imaginary part of the action can only come from the pole at the horizon .",
    "it is important to parameterize in terms of the proper spatial distance in order to get the correct result @xcite .     for the first method the painlev coordinate @xmath58 was the proper spatial distance . in this case",
    "the proper spatial distance between any two points at some fixed @xmath59 is given by@xmath60 as with the null geodesic method we are only concerned with radial rays , and so the only proper spatial distance we are concerned with is radial @xmath61    employing the near horizon approximation @xmath62 we find that @xmath63 is the proper radial distance .",
    "so for particles emitted radially@xmath64 and from this point the computation is the same as for the previous method , yielding @xmath65 for the temperature .",
    "we first illustrate how these methods apply for the horizon of an accelerated observer .",
    "we shall employ different coordinate systems for 2d rindler space to show that the same temperature results from applying the two tunneling methods directly .",
    "the forms of the rindler metric being used are : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the proper acceleration of the hyperbolic observer .",
    "here there is no well defined total mass or energy as with schwarzschild , but there are well defined horizons .",
    "the metric ( [ rindler1 ] ) locates the horizon at @xmath68 , whereas for the metric ( [ rindler2a ] ) it is at @xmath69  .",
    "we consider a null particle to be emitted from the rindler horizon , and it is reasonable to assume the emitted particle will have a hamiltonian associated with it .",
    "however providing an explicit definition for the total energy of the space - time is less than clear , though it has been claimed recently @xcite that one can associate a surface energy density @xmath70  with a rindler horizon and a total energy @xmath71  with the spacetime .  in the context of the null geodesic method",
    "we expect that the hamiltonian of the space - time will correspond to the total energy @xmath10  ( perhaps with respect to some reference energy via a limiting procedure ) * *  * * so as long as the emitted particles have @xmath72 , in which case the method is applicable .",
    "we shall proceed under the assumption that we can use hamilton s equation and follow through the derivation for the null geodesic method as before .",
    "we shall find that these assumptions are justified a - posteriori .",
    "*  *    the null geodesics for ( [ rindler2a ] ) in the @xmath73-direction are given by @xmath74 and so @xmath75 yielding a temperature of@xmath76 where the surface gravity at the horizon is @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "we now employ the hamilton - jacobi ansatz for the rindler metric ( [ rindler1 ] ) .    here",
    "@xmath78 and at the horizon @xmath79 so using ( [ formw ] ) @xmath80 again giving a temperature of @xmath81 .",
    "we see that we can recover the expected value for the temperature of rindler space given our assumptions .",
    "this could perhaps be regarded further evidence that a total energy @xmath82  can be associated with rindler space .",

    "this in turn results in the temperature@xmath102 which is the same as the found for the kerr - newman black hole by other means .",
    "the restriction to two specific values of @xmath88  is because of the presence of the ergosphere .",

    "the imaginary part of the action leads to a non - zero finite temperature @xmath192 for any integer @xmath189 .",
    "the extremal temperature is quantized in units of the temperature of a schwarzschild black hole !",
    "note that this result depends crucially on the inclusion of the third order term , whose evaluation depends upon assumptions of the choice of riemannian sheet .",
    "had we expanded the integral for small @xmath193 , we would have obtained a value for the temperature given by @xmath194 in eq .",
    "( [ unphys ] ) , ie a negative temperature for the extremal black hole .    obtaining many ( finite - valued ) results for the temperature is reminiscent of the proposal that an extremal black hole can be in thermal equilibrium at any finite temperature @xcite .",
    "however we can see that these strange results arise due to an inappropriate use of the wkb approximation in the null geodesic method .",
    "although writing @xmath188 is consistent with the the assumptions @xmath37  and @xmath195  ( where @xmath39  denotes the location of the event horizon of the original background space - time ) for a non - extremal black hole , in fact the quantity @xmath22 does not exist , since the extremal black hole can not retain an event horizon upon emitting any neutral quantum of energy  its only option for future evolution would appear to be that of evolving into a naked singularity , which cosmic censorship forbids .",
    "these results seem to imply that for black holes near extremality one must consider the full self - gravitating results , where the emitted particle drives the hole toward extremality .  for an already extremal spacetime",
    "both methods yield a diverging real component in the action .",
    "this could be taken to imply that no particle can be emitted ( since the alternative is creation of a naked singularity ) .",
    "based on the results of this calculation it would be interesting to consider the emission of a specific charged particle that would cause the black hole to go from one extremal black hole to another extremal black hole .  in that case there would be well defined horizons before and after emission .",
    "we have examined and compared the two different approaches to the tunnelling method for finding the black hole temperatures .",
    "our results indicate that the method is particularly robust for non - extremal black holes , yielding results commensurate with other methods for rindler space , rotating black holes , and taub - nut black holes . in this latter instance",
    "we have provided independent verification of the temperatures obtained for taub - nut spaces without ctcs via analytic continuation methods .",
    "indeed it is not too difficult to show that the temperatures even match when ctcs are present , though in this case an a - priori justification for the method is unclear .",
    "we also investigated extremal black holes , for which the tunnelling method is somewhat more problematic due to its dynamic nature .",
    "we found that the temperature is proportional to the energy of the emitted particles for black holes close to extremality .",
    "we also found that both methods yield a divergent real part to the action for extremal black holes , which is suggestive of a full suppression of particle emission .",
    "however the null geodesic method has a nonzero finite imaginary parts , whose values yields a countably infinite number of possible finite temperatures for an extremal reissner - nordstrom black hole .",
    "this rather strange result arises because of a breakdown of the wkb method in the null geodesic approximation .",
    "this suggests limitations on the method , whose study would make an interesting subject for future work .",
    "an interesting test case would be that of emission of charged particles from an extremal black hole .",
    "the presence of closed timelike curves in taub - nut space can be seen by considering the curve generated by the killing vector @xmath196  and by examining @xmath197 @xmath198 so for @xmath199 , and @xmath153 with @xmath200 the quantity @xmath201 , yielding a timelike @xmath202 ; the curve @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath87 becomes a ctc .",
    "however there is a range of hyperbolic taub - nut solutions that occur when @xmath141 that do nt contain ctc s .",
    "now it is possible for @xmath197 to be negative when @xmath205but this occurs for small values of @xmath40 and happens inside the horizon .",
    "explicitly when @xmath153 then @xmath197 is given by@xmath206",
    "so @xmath207 will always be true as long as @xmath208 figures 1 - 3 are plots of @xmath209  for a range of mass and nut - charge .  on the plots the x - axis is @xmath210 .",
    "the @xmath153  case corresponds to hyperbolic solutions whose event horizon has radius @xmath211 .",
    "since @xmath197  only becomes negative when @xmath212  ( within @xmath141 ) any ctcs are contained within the horizon ( provided the mass is positive ) .",
    "so no ctc s are present outside of the horizon for the hyperbolic case when @xmath213            this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
