    "even though investigations started already in 1979 @xcite , cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 still carries key enigmas of heavy fermion ( hf ) superconductivity ( sc ) .",
    "numerous ( pressure ) studies on other ce - based hf compounds , notably concerning the 115-family , focus on the magnetic instability or magnetic quantum critical point as a driving force for exotic behaviors such as unconventional sc .",
    "however , in reference to the case of elementary ce , it is known that the ce valence changes with pressure ( delocalization of the @xmath4 electron ) and that this effect may also play a major role in the determination of electronic properties . as a consequence ,",
    "observations in ce compounds may result from a complex combination of different underlying microscopic phenomena . in this respect",
    ", cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 may be a good candidate to help to disentangle the contributions from the spin and charge degrees of freedom , more intricate in other ce systems ( like the 115-family ) .",
    "in particular , the pressure  ( @xmath5 ) - temperature  ( @xmath6 ) phase diagram ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 deviates from the `` generic '' one in which superconductivity ( sc ) emerges rather close to a magnetic instability , presumably mediated by critical spin fluctuations ( sf ) .",

    "the most elaborate scenario @xcite invokes critical charge or valence fluctuations ( vf ) associated with an underlying valence transition ( vt ) , i.e. delocalization of the ce @xmath4 electron when tuning @xmath5 across the critical region ( @xmath11 ) . in elementary ce ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the first - order valence transition ( fovt ) line ( @xmath12 transition ) , the location of its critical end point ( cep ) and the valence cross - over ( vco ) line have been unambiguously identified by several experiments @xcite . in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 ,",
    "obviously the cep lies at much lower @xmath6 , where the electron delocalization is accompanied in the transport data by a decrease in resistivity , in combination with sc at the lowest @xmath6 .",
    "preceding experiments point towards distinct natures of the two sc phases @xcite ( related to @xmath13 and @xmath11 respectively ) , and have unveiled close to @xmath11 features peculiar to the concept of critical vf , such as a @xmath6-linear resistivity and an increased residual resistivity @xmath14 @xcite . despite such compelling indications for the presence of critical vf in proximity to a cep , additional signatures of the putative vt are still highly desirable , in order to consolidate the decisive role of the @xmath4 electron delocalization in the properties of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 , and accordingly in other ce - based compounds .",

    "such a normalization can be regarded as a simple way to separate the @xmath6-dependent contribution to the scattering rate , in order to better detect the @xmath5-dependence of the drude weight .",

    "second , even more promising , the widespread relevance of the vf scenario should be investigated by applying a similar resistivity analysis to other ce - based compounds , especially to the more common cases where @xmath13 and @xmath11 are not well separated .",
    "indeed , the identification of @xmath11 and the @xmath4 electron delocalization is generally more elusive than that of the breakdown of magnetism , @xmath13 , reflecting the competition between the kondo effect and the rkky interaction .",

    "in other words , the electric field produced by a longitudinal heat current becomes exclusively transverse .",
    "whether this happens accidentally and is simply related to the fact that @xmath18 and @xmath17 probe quite different phenomena in a complex multiband system evolving under @xmath5 , or whether the orthogonal electric field occurs for more profound reasons , possibly linked to the @xmath4 electron delocalization at @xmath11 , is left for further studies . at this stage , we can only make the following comments : a similar trend has been reported in cecoin@xmath133 in the low @xmath30 and @xmath6 limit @xcite ( but it is partly masked by sc ) .",

    "in conclusion , we have performed for the first time a multiprobe study under high pressure on a cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 single crystal with a unprecedented high superconducting @xmath8 and low @xmath14 in order to deepen the understanding of the expected ce @xmath4 electron delocalization at 4  gpa .",
    "a careful resistivity analysis unveils the proximity of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 to the critical end point of the valence transition line , located at @xmath226  gpa and a slightly negative temperature .",
    "this means that cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 lies entirely in the valence cross - over regime and does not exhibit a first - order valence transition down to lowest temperatures .",
    "however , around @xmath11 and below about 30  k the complete @xmath21 data set is governed by this adjacent critical end point , leading to a noteworthy data collapse .",
    "in addition to the critical end point , the experimentally determined valence cross - over line has been added as an important feature to the @xmath2 phase diagram of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    as an extraordinary tool , the new multiprobe setup ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) gives access to a huge parameter space , in which diverse physical quantities like @xmath15 , @xmath19 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath17 can be simultaneously compared on a single sample and under extreme conditions ( low temperatures , high pressures and magnetic field ) .",
    "it should stimulate the detailed exploration of a variety of systems in strongly correlated matter . in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 , apart from resistivity , @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath17 may also be considerably affected by the underlying critical end point since they reveal pronounced anomalies close to @xmath11 ( fig .",

    "it still needs to be elucidated whether these features are solely linked to the ce @xmath4 electron delocalization , or rather specific to the case where valence fluctuation - mediated superconductivity is present , like in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "an extended theoretical framework and more experimental data under pressure from different probes will help to better identify these complex signatures and their relationship to the electron delocalization .",
