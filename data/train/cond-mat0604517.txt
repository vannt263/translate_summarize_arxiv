    "the decoherence and relaxation of an impurity spin is a classic problem in condensed mater physics .",
    "more then 30 years ago , langreth and wilkins developed a theory of spin resonance in dilute magnetic alloys .",
    "@xcite the principal objective was to derive bloch - like equations for the paramagnetic resonance using the kadanoff - baym  @xcite and keldysh  @xcite techniques to nonequilibrium .",
    "this included the description of spin precession and spin relaxation of a finite concentration of magnetic impurities weakly coupled to a metallic host .",
    "the recent advent of quantum - dot devices and their potential application to quantum computing has renewed interest in the spin dynamics of a _ single _ impurity .",
    "in contrast to real magnetic impurities , quantum dots can be controlled in exquisite detail , and can be tuned at will from weak coupling to the kondo regime .",
    "perturbative approaches , such as that of langreth and wilkins ,  @xcite fail to describe the strong correlation that develop in latter regime .",
    "this calls for new theoretical approaches to nonequilibrium dynamics , suitable for treating the strongly correlated state .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the dynamics of a single spin coupled to an infinitely large environment of noninteracting particles , in order to investigate spin - relaxation phenomena at all temperatures and coupling regimes .",
    "relaxation of a single spin is the simplest example for real - time dynamics in a quantum impurity system .",
    "other examples might be qubits , coupled quantum dots , or biological donor - acceptor molecules . in such systems one is generically interested in the dynamics of a finite subsystem interacting with an infinitely large environment .",
    "the nature of the environment may vary from one realization to another .",
    "it can consist of a fermionic bath , as in single - electron and single - molecule transistors , or a bosonic bath , as in the spin - boson model . in certain cases",
    "a combined fermionic - bosonic bath might be in order .",
    "the immense difficulty of treating the real - time dynamics of quantum impurity systems stems from the need to track the full time evolution of the density operator of the entire system  environment plus impurity .",
    "the kadanoff - baym and keldysh techniques  @xcite provide an elegant platform for perturbative expansions of the density operator . in general , however , perturbative approaches are plagued by the infra - red divergences caused by degeneracies on the impurity , making them inadequate for tackling quantum impurities .",
    "here we take an alternative approach to the real - time dynamics based on wilson s numerical renormalization - group ( nrg ) method .",
    "@xcite    the nrg is a very powerful tool for accurately calculating equilibrium properties of arbitrarily complex quantum impurities . originally developed for treating the single - channel kondo hamiltonian ,  @xcite this nonperturbative approach was successfully extended to the anderson impurity model ( symmetric  @xcite and asymmetric  @xcite ) , the two - channel kondo hamiltonian ,  @xcite different two - impurity clusters ,  @xcite and a host of related zero - dimensional problems .",
    "recently , we extended the approach to a certain class of time - dependent problems where a sudden perturbation is applied to the impurity at time @xmath8 .  @xcite similar to the equilibrium nrg , the time - dependent nrg ( td - nrg ) can be applied to all coupling strengths and is not confined to the weak - coupling regime .",
    "it is capable of accessing all time scales , including arbitrary long as well as arbitrary short times .",
    "these appealing properties make the td - nrg a powerful new approach for studying nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum - impurity systems .    in this work",
    ", we present the complete details of the td - nrg , and apply it to the spin dynamics of the kondo model .",
    "a comprehensive analysis is presented for the spin relaxation and spin precession as a function of temperature , magnetic field and coupling strength . both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic",
    "couplings are considered . in the kondo regime ,",
    "spin dynamics is governed by the kondo time scale @xmath9 , where @xmath5 is the kondo temperature of the system . in the ferromagnetic regime ,",
    "the underlying time scale is strongly dependent on temperature , reflecting the fact that the effective equilibrium coupling flows to zero with decreasing temperature .",
    "the idea of applying the nrg to nonequilibrium dynamics dates back to the work of costi .",
    "@xcite in the spirit of the equilibrium nrg , costi evaluated the nonequilibrium spectral functions using an individual wilson shell for each frequency interval .",
    "however , as already recognized by costi ,  @xcite a full multiple - shell evaluation is ultimately required for the correct description of nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "the physical reason is simple : when expanded in terms of the eigenstates of the perturbed hamiltonian , the initial state of the unperturbed system contains contributions from all energy scales .",
    "this calls for an adequate coupling of low- and high - energy scales absent in the equilibrium nrg .    to circumvent this problem",
    ", we construct a complete basis set of the wilson chain using the nrg eigenstates . implementing a suitable resummation procedure , we track all states that contribute to the time evolution of the observables of interest .",
    "@xcite explicitly , we have shown that the time evolution of a general local operator @xmath10 can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dimension - full nrg eigen - energies of the perturbed hamiltonian at iteration @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the matrix representation of @xmath10 at that iteration , and @xmath16 is the reduced density matrix  @xcite in the basis of perturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the restrictive sum over @xmath17 and @xmath18 requires that at least one of these states is discarded at iteration @xmath19 . in context of the equilibrium nrg",
    ", the reduced density matrix has been already used for the calculation of spectral functions .",
    "@xcite    equation  ( [ eqn : time - evolution - intro ] ) is the centerpiece of the td - nrg approach and will be heavily using throughout this paper .",
    "below we present a detailed discussion of its derivation and implementation . here",
    "we only wish to emphasize the following points .",
    "( i ) the reduced density matrix occurs naturally in our formulation .",
    "( ii ) it does not follow a unitary time evolution and , therefore , contains information on dissipation and decoherence .",
    "( iii ) equation  ( [ eqn : time - evolution - intro ] ) arises from summation over the _",
    "complete _ many - body fock space of the wilson chain .",
    "no truncation of states is involved .      as implied above",
    ", this paper has two main objectives : an indepth presentation of the td - nrg and a comprehensive analysis of the spin relaxation for a single spin coupled to a conduction band .",
    "accordingly , the remainder of the paper divides into two major parts .",
    "the following three sections are devoted to an extensive exposition of the td - nrg .",
    "this includes a detailed derivation of the approach , along with benchmark results for both a fermionic and a bosonic bath .",
    "section  [ sec : td - nrg - theory - general ] contains a general formulation of td - nrg for any initial density operator @xmath20 of the system .",
    "in particular , eq .  ( [ eqn : time - evolution - intro ] ) is derived and an explicit definition of the reducted density matrix @xmath21 is given . in sec .",
    "[ sec : reduced - density - matrix ] , we discuss how the reduced density matrix is calculated in practice in the generic case where @xmath20 is the equilibrium density operator for the unperturbed system . the complete td - nrg algorithm is outlined in turn in sec .",
    "[ sec : td - nrg - algo ] . in sections",
    "[ sec : rlm ] and [ sec : spin - boson ] , we compare the td - nrg to exact results for two distinct models : the resonant - level model and a restricted version of the spin - boson model .",
    "these two test cases allow us to establish the accuracy of the td - nrg on all time - scales , and to investigate how well a discretized finite - size system can be used to mimic nonequilibrium dynamics in a continuous bath .",
    "following this detailed exposition of the td - nrg , we proceed in sections  [ sec : kondo - model - analytics ] and [ sec : kondo - model - td - nrg ] to the spin dynamics in the kondo model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : kondo - model - analytics ] , we introduce the model and present some basic analytical considerations . these include an explicit calculation of the short - time response up to second order in the dimensionless exchange coupling .",
    "numerical results for arbitrarily long time scale are covered in turn in sec .",
    "[ sec : kondo - model - td - nrg ] , both for the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes .",
    "different configurations of the magnetic field are also considered . through comparison with the analytical results of sec .",
    "[ sec : kondo - model - analytics ] we are able to establish the accuracy of the td - nrg results at short time scales .",
    "the true power of the numerical solution lies , however , in the long - time behavior not accessible by perturbative techniques .",
    "in the present section we formulate the td - nrg approach in general terms , before turning to concrete examples in sections  [ sec : rlm ] , [ sec : spin - boson ] , and [ sec : kondo - model - td - nrg ] .",
    "hereafter we assume that the initial density operator at time @xmath8 is known , when a sudden perturbation @xmath22 is switch on . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the system evolves in time with the full hamiltonian @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the hamiltonian of the unperturbed system at time @xmath26 . denoting the initial density operator by @xmath20",
    ", the expectation value of any operator @xmath27 at time @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the corresponding time - dependent density operator .",
    "our first goal is to show that expectation value @xmath31 of any local operator @xmath27 can be rewritten in terms of a sum over the contributions of a sequence of reduced density matrices @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite the reduced density matrices are generated by systematically tracing out all environment degrees of freedom .",
    "hence the unitary time evolution of the density matrix of the system as a whole is lost , giving rise to dissipation and decoherence .",
    "although our derivation makes explicit reference to the nrg procedure , it might be applicable to other methods as well .",
    "two key ingredients underlie our approach : ( i ) the identification of a _ complete basis set _ of the many - body fock space of the wilson chain based on the nrg eigenstates at the different iterations ; ( ii ) expectation values are obtained by explicitly tracing over this complete basis set .",
    "this marks a significant departure from the conventional renormalization - group concept , where the relevant physical information is contained in the _ kept states_. here , the _ discarded _ states are solemnly responsible for the time evolution .",
    "this also solves the problem of overcounting excitations encountered by costi :  @xcite each excitation contributes only once to expectation values , at that iteration where the corresponding state is discarded . for the case",
    "where @xmath20 either projects onto a single state or represents the full equilibrium density operator of the unperturbed hamiltonian , we are able give a closed analytical expression for the reduced density matrices .",
    "the hamiltonian of a quantum impurity system is generally given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 models the continuous bath , @xmath35 represents the decoupled impurity , and @xmath36 describes the coupling between the two subsystems .",
    "the entire system is characterized at time @xmath8 by an arbitrary density matrix @xmath20 , when a sudden , time - independent perturbation @xmath22 is switched on : @xmath37 . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the density operator evolves according to @xmath39    in equilibrium , one can solve such a quantum impurity system very accurately using the nrg . at the heart of this approach",
    "is a logarithmic discretization of the continuous bath , controlled by the discretization parameter @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite the continuum limit is recovered for @xmath41 .",
    "using an appropriate unitary transformation ,  @xcite the hamiltonian is mapped onto a semi - infinite chain , with the impurity coupled to the open end .",
    "the @xmath42th link along the chain represents an exponentially decreasing energy scale : @xmath43 for a fermionic bath  @xcite and @xmath44 for a bosonic bath .",
    "@xcite using this hierarchy of scales , the sequence of finite - size hamiltonians @xmath45 for the @xmath42-site chain  -site chain contains the impurity degrees of freedom , as well as the first @xmath46 wilson shells ( labelled by @xmath47 ) . in contrary to the standard nrg notations we consider @xmath48 as dimensionfull hamiltonian in order to emphasize the importance of all energy shells for the real time evolution . ]",
    "is solved iteratively , discarding the high - energy states at the conclusion of each step to maintain a manageable number of states .",
    "the reduced basis set of @xmath45 so obtained is expected to faithfully describe the spectrum of the full hamiltonian on a scale of @xmath49 , corresponding to the temperature @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite    due to the exponential form of the boltzmann factors , the reduced nrg basis set of @xmath45 is sufficient for an accurate calculation of thermodynamic quantities at temperature @xmath51 .",
    "this is no longer the case once the system is driven out of equilibrium .",
    "since the nonequilibrium dynamics involves all energy scales exceeding @xmath51 , and in the absence of a general criterion as to which states contribute to the dynamics , a complete basis set of the fock space @xmath52 of @xmath45 is required . in the following",
    "we identify such a complete basis set of @xmath52 , composed of approximate eigenstates of @xmath45 .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath54 can be viewed either as acting only on the sub - chain of length @xmath19 , or as acting on the full chain of length @xmath42 , but with the hopping matrix elements @xmath55 all set to zero .",
    "the former picture is the traditional one . in this paper",
    "we adopt the latter point of view.,width=302 ]      there are two possible ways to envision the iterative nrg solution of the @xmath42-site chain . in the traditional picture",
    "one starts from a core cluster that consists of the impurity degrees of freedom and the @xmath56 site , and enlarges the chain by one site at each nrg step .",
    "alternatively , one can view the nrg procedure as starting from the full chain of length @xmath42 , but with the hopping matrix elements set to zero along the chain . at each successive step another hopping matrix element",
    "is switched on , until the full hamiltonian @xmath45 is recovered . in this latter picture , to be adopted below , the entire sequence of hamiltonians @xmath54 with @xmath57 act on the fock space of the @xmath42-site chain .",
    "accordingly , each nrg eigen - energy of @xmath54 has an extra degeneracy of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the number of distinct states at each site along the chain .",
    "the extra degeneracy stems from the @xmath60 `` environment '' sites at the end of the chain , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "let us elaborate on the formal connection between the two pictures presented above .",
    "let @xmath61 label the nrg eigenstates of @xmath54 when acting on the @xmath19-site chain , and let @xmath62 denote their corresponding eigen - energies .",
    "enumerating the different configurations of site @xmath63 by @xmath64 , each of the tensor - product states @xmath65 with arbitrary @xmath66 is then a degenerate eigenstate of @xmath54 with energy @xmath62 , when acting on the full @xmath42-site chain .",
    "for brevity , we introduce the shorthand notation @xmath67 , where the `` environment '' variable @xmath68 encodes the @xmath69 site labels @xmath66 . the index @xmath19 is used in this notation to record where the chain is partitioned into a `` subsystem '' and an `` environment '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .    in the conventional nrg picture ,",

    "note that the transition itself from the tensor - product states @xmath71 to the eigenstates @xmath78 involves no truncation of the fock space . however , since the dimension of the fock space grows as @xmath79 , a complete basis set is not manageable for any practical chain length of order @xmath80 . in the equilibrium nrg",
    ", high - energy states are thus discarded after each iteration , as these do not contribute to the equilibrium density matrix .",
    "this latter statement is guarantied by the hierarchy of scales along the wilson chain .",
    "it would not apply to any ordinary tight - binding chain with constant hopping matrix elements .",

    "in the course of the nrg , only the latter states are used to span the hamiltonian @xmath83 within the reduced subspace @xmath84 .",
    "note , however , that the sum of both subsets still constitutes a complete basis set for the @xmath42-site chain . repeating this procedure at each subsequent iteration , we recursively divide the retained subset into a discarded part and a retained part .",
