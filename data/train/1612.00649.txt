    "the transition from centralized electricity power grid toward a more decentralized one is posing different challenges @xcite . in specific terms",
    ", the intermittence of low - carbon renewable sources like wind and solar poses an interesting management task @xcite : periods of high demand might not match with supply .",
    "energy storage then becomes an important capability for managing the possible mismatches . in this letter",
    ", we use the stochastic characterization of both electricity generation and electricity demand in different periods during the day ( e.g. hour - by - hour ) .",
    "we follow the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) and assume that both may be modeled as independent random variables at each period .",
    "depending on surplus / deficit outcome , the storage managing entity shall estimate the situation for next period .",
    "our goal here is to understand the conditions that a system composed by a intermittent source plus a storage device can be self - managed .",
    "we propose an equation to evaluate the probability that the system is not self - sufficient either by generating more electricity than can be stored , or by consuming more than it is supplied .",
    "we numerically demonstrate this procedure using two examples : a virtual utility that aggregates several households with a hydro power plant as storage and wind as generation , and a household with battery and solar panels .",
    "we interpret these results as a promising way to self - manage electricity looking at its use value .",
    "they also indicates promising ways to implement cooperative sharing of surpluses , mainly when weather forecast is available .",
    "consider a scenario composed by : an entity that demands electricity , an entity that generates electricity , and an entity that stores energy to balance possible surpluses / deficits .",

    "the storage situation at time step @xmath6 is given by the realization of supply and demand at @xmath6 , considering the storage situation in previous time step @xmath10 .",

    "equation works regardless since it is based on the realized values .",
    "if the goal is prediction , the storage managing entity can estimate the upcoming conditions @xmath17 if it knows ( i ) the own state @xmath14 and ( ii ) the distributions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . condition ( i ) is straight from the management knowledge about its own state , while ( ii ) can be based on empirical studies as in @xcite or in energy generation forecast based on weather as in @xcite .",
    "the system is said to be self - sufficient at time step @xmath6 if , and only if : @xmath18 .",
    "the probability that this event happens is given in the following corollary .",

    "the storage controller can compute the probabilities of these events only based on the distribution of @xmath8 , which is easily computed from the probability distribution functions @xcite .",
    "we first assume the following system : a virtual utility that aggregates the demand of several households , and has under their use one wind farm as its generator and one hydro power plant as its storage .",

    "therefore , @xmath26 is not anymore a random variable .    as an example , we assume a battery with capacity @xmath27 kwh , and minimum level @xmath28 . the generation at @xmath29kwh ( e.g. in a winter sunny day at 15:00 ) is perfectly estimated by the weather forecast , while the the demand @xmath30 is a weibull distribution @xcite : @xmath31 = f_{d(t+1)}(y ) = 1 - e^{-(y/\\lambda)^k } ,      % \\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the scale and @xmath33 is the shape parameters .",
