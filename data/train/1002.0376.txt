    "taking the 50/50 ( eu , ba)tio@xmath1 ordered alloy as our starting point ( fig .",
    "[ th_phonons ] inset ) , we next calculate its properties using first - principles . for details of the computations see the methods section .",
    "we began by calculating the phonon dispersion for the high symmetry , cubic perovskite reference structure at a lattice constant of 3.95   ( chosen , somewhat arbitrarily , for this first step because it is the average of the experimental batio@xmath1 and eutio@xmath1 lattice constants ) , with the magnetic spins aligned ferromagnetically ; our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ th_phonons ] , plotted along the high symmetry lines of the brillouin zone .",
    "importantly we find a polar @xmath23-point instability with an imaginary frequency of 103@xmath24  @xmath25 which is dominated by relative oxygen ",
    "ti / eu displacements ( the eigenmode displacements for eu , ba , ti , o@xmath26 and o@xmath27 are 0.234 , -0.059 , 0.394 , -0.360 and -0.303 respectively ) ; such polar instabilities are indicative of a tendency to ferroelectricity .",
    "the zone boundary rotational instabilities that often occur in perovskite oxides and lead to non - polar , antiferrodistortive ground states are notably absent ( in fact the flat bands at @xmath1160 @xmath25 are stable rotational vibrations ) .",
    "interestingly we find that the eu ions have a significant amplitude in the soft - mode eigenvector , in contrast to the ba ions both here and in the parent batio@xmath1 .",
    "next we performed a structural optimization of both the unit cell shape and the ionic positions of our eu@xmath0ba@xmath0tio@xmath1 alloy with the total volume constrained to that of the ideal cubic structure studied above ( 3.95@xmath28 @xmath28 per formula unit ) .",
    "our main finding is that the eu@xmath0ba@xmath0tio@xmath1 alloy is polar with large relative displacements of oxygen and both ti and eu relative to the high symmetry reference structure .",
    "using the berry phase method we obtain a ferroelectric polarization value of @xmath29 @xmath12c/@xmath13 .",
    "our calculated ground state is orthorhombic with the polarization oriented along a [ 011 ] direction and lattice parameters @xmath30  , @xmath31   and @xmath32  .",
    "as expected from our analysis of the soft mode , the calculated ground state is characterized by large oxygen ",
    "ti / eu displacements , and the absence of rotations or tilts of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "importantly , the large eu amplitude in the soft mode manifests as a large off - centering of the eu from the center of its oxygen coordination polyhedron in the ground state structure .",
    "the origin of the large eu displacement lies in its small ionic radius compared with that of divalent ba@xmath14 : the large coordination cage around the eu ion which is imposed by the large lattice constant of the alloy results in under - bonding of the eu that can be relieved by off - centering .",
    "indeed , we find that in calculations for fully relaxed single phase eutio@xmath1 , the oxygen octahedra tilt to reduce the volume of the a site in a similar manner to those known to occur in srtio@xmath1 , in which the a cation size is almost identical .",
    "this eu off - centering is desirable for the edm experiment because the change in local environment at the magnetic ions on ferroelectric switching determines the sensitivity of the edm measurement .    .calculated ferroelectric polarizations , p , of eu@xmath0ba@xmath0tio@xmath1 at three different volumes . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that the magnitude of the polarization is strongly dependent on the volume used in the calculation ( table  [ pversusv ] ) . at the experimental volume ( reported in the next section ) , which is only slightly larger than our constrained volume of @xmath33 @xmath28 , we obtain a polarization of 28 @xmath12c/@xmath13 . at full relaxation , where we find a larger volume close to that of batio@xmath1 , we obtain a polarization of 44 @xmath12c/@xmath13 , almost certainly a substantial over - estimate .",
    "this volume dependence suggests that the use of pressure to reduce the lattice parameters and suppress the ferroelectric polarization could be a viable tool for reducing the coercivity at low temperatures .",
    "indeed our computations show that , at a pressure corresponding to 2.8 gpa applied to the experimental volume the theoretical structure is cubic , with both the polarization and coercive field reduced to zero .    finally , to investigate the likelihood of magnetic ordering , we calculated the relative energies of the ferromagnetic state discussed above and of two antiferromagnetic arrangements : planes of ferromagnetically ordered spins coupled antiferromagnetically along either the pseudo - cubic @xmath34 axis or the @xmath35 or @xmath36 axes .",
    "( note that these are degenerate in the high - symmetry cubic structure ) .",
    "for each magnetic arrangement we re - relaxed the lattice parameters and atomic positions . as expected for the highly localized eu @xmath16 electrons on their diluted sublattice , the energy differences between the different configurations are small  around 1 mev per 40 atom supercell  suggesting an absence of magnetic ordering down to low temperatures .",
    "while our calculations find the ferromagnetic state to be the lowest energy , this is likely a consequence of our a - site ordering and should not lead us to anticipate ferromagnetism at low temperature ( note that , after completing our study , we found a report of an early effort to synthesize ( eu , ba)tio@xmath1@xcite in which a large magnetization , attributed to a - site ordering and ferromagnetism , was reported .",
    "a - site ordering is now known to be difficult to achieve in perovskite - structure oxides , however , and we find no evidence of it in our samples . moreover the earlier work determined a tetragonal crystal structure in contrast to our refined orthorhombic structure . )    in summary , our predicted properties of the ( eu , ba)tio@xmath1 alloy  large ferroelectric polarization , reducible with pressure , with large eu displacements , and strongly suppressed magnetic ordering ",
    "meet the criteria for the electron electric dipole moment search and motivate the synthesis and characterization of the compound , described next .",
    "eu@xmath0ba@xmath0tio@xmath1 was synthesized by solid - state reaction using mechanochemical activation before calcination .",
    "for details see the methods section .",
    "the density of the sintered pellets was 86 - 88% of the theoretical density .",
    "x - ray diffraction at room temperature revealed the cubic perovskite @xmath37 structure with a=3.9642(1) . at 100k",
    "we obtain an orthorhombic ground state with space group @xmath38 , in agreement with the gga@xmath39 prediction , and lattice parameters 3.9563(1 ) , 5.6069(2 ) and 5.5998(2 )  .",
    "the final step in our study is the characterization of the samples , to check that the measured properties are indeed the same as those that we predicted and desired .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the temperature dependence of the complex permittivity between 1hz and 1mhz , measured using an impedance analyzer alpha - an ( novocontrol ) .",
    "the low - frequency data below 100khz are affected above 150@xmath40 by a small defect - induced conductivity and related maxwell - wagner polarization ; the high - frequency data clearly show a maximum in the permittivity near @xmath41=213@xmath40  indicating the ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "two regions of dielectric dispersion  near 100@xmath40  and below 75@xmath40   are seen in tan@xmath42 ; these could originate from oxygen defects or from ferroelectric domain wall motion .",
    "measurement of the polarization was adversely affected by the sample conductivity above 150@xmath40 , but at lower temperatures good quality ferroelectric hysteresis loops were obtained ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , inset ) . at 135@xmath40",
    "we obtain a saturation polarization of @xmath118 @xmath12c/@xmath13 .",
    "the deviation from the predicted value could be the result of incomplete saturation as well as the strong volume dependence of the polarization combined with the well - known inaccuracies in gga@xmath39 volumes .",
    "as expected , at lower temperatures the coercive field strongly increases , and only partial polarization switching was possible even with an applied electric field of 18kv / cm ( at higher electric field dielectric breakdown was imminent ) .",
    "the partial switching is responsible for the apparent decrease in saturation polarization below 40k .",
    "time - domain thz transmission and infrared reflectivity spectra ( not shown here ) reveal a softening of the polar phonon from @xmath1140@xmath43 at 300@xmath40  to @xmath1115@xmath43 at @xmath41 , and then its splitting into two components in the ferroelectric phase .",
    "both components harden on cooling below @xmath41 , with the lower frequency component remaining below 20@xmath43 down to 10@xmath40 , and the higher - frequency branch saturating near 70@xmath43 at 10@xmath40 .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the soft - mode behavior in batio@xmath44@xcite .",
    "however , when we extract the contribution to the static permittivity that comes from the polar phonon , we find that it is considerably smaller than our measured value ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) indicating an additional contribution to the dielectric relaxation .",
    "our observations suggest that the phase transition is primarily soft - mode driven , but also exhibits some order - disorder character .    finally , we measured the magnetic susceptibility @xmath45 at various static magnetic fields as a function of temperature down to 0.4k .",
    "( for details see the methods section . )",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath46 peaks at @xmath471.9k indicating an absence of magnetic ordering above this temperature .",
    "the @xmath46 data up to 300k show curie - weiss behavior @xmath48 with @xmath49=-1.63k and @xmath50 emuk/(goe ) .",
    "the peak in susceptibility at 1.9k is frequency independent and not influenced by zero field heating measurements after field cooling , confirming antiferromagnetic order below @xmath51k . as in pure eutio@xmath1 , the @xmath46 peak is suppressed by a static external magnetic field , indicating stabilization of the paramagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "magnetization curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] inset ) show saturation above @xmath52 oe at temperatures below @xmath53 and slower saturation at 5k .",
    "no open magnetic hysteresis loops were observed .",
    "in summary , we have designed a new material ",
    "eu@xmath0ba@xmath0tio@xmath1  with the properties required to enable a measurement of the edm to a higher accuracy than can currently be realized .",
    "subsequent synthesis of eu@xmath0ba@xmath0tio@xmath1 ceramics confirmed their desirable ferroelectric polarization and absence of magnetic ordering above 1.9k .",
    "the search for the permanent dipole moment of the electron using eu@xmath0ba@xmath0tio@xmath1 is now underway .",
    "initial measurements have already achieved an edm upper limit of 5 @xmath54 e.cm , which is within a factor of 10 of the current record with a solid - state - based edm search @xcite .",
    "we are currently studying a number of systematic effects that may mask the edm signal .",
    "the primary error originates from ferroelectric hysteresis - induced heating of the samples during polarization reversal .",
    "this heating gives rise to a change in magnetic susceptibility , which , in a non - zero external magnetic field , leads to an undesirable sample magnetization response .",
    "we are working to control the absolute magnetic field at the location of the samples to the 0.1 @xmath12 g level .",

    "<S> this technique rests on the fact that , since spin is the only intrinsic vector associated with the electron , a non - vanishing electron edm is either parallel or antiparallel to its spin and hence its magnetic moment . as a result , </S>",

    "<S> first , the solid must contain magnetic ions with unpaired spins , since the equal and opposite spins of paired electrons have corresponding equal and opposite edms and contribute no effect . </S>",
    "<S> second , it must be engineered such that the _ conventional _ linear magnetoelectric tensor is zero ; our approach to achieving this is to use a paramagnet in which the conventional effect is forbidden by time - reversal symmetry@xcite . to reach the required sensitivity , </S>",
