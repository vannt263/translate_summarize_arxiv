    "recently , the presence of an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) quantum critical behavior near the superconducting ( sc ) depairing field ( or , the mean field upper critical field ) @xmath5 at low temperatures has been commonly found in several unconventional superconductors such as cecoin@xmath4 @xcite , pressured cerhin@xmath4 @xcite , nppd@xmath6al@xmath4 @xcite , ce@xmath6pdin@xmath7 @xcite , and tl - compounds of cuprates @xcite .",
    "most of these materials belong to the so - called heavy - fermion superconductors and hence , are expected to have a large zeeman term , i.e. , remarkable pauli paramagnetic pair breaking ( ppb ) effects . conventionally , an afm order is expected to be suppressed by the presence of a finite sc energy gap @xmath8 @xcite below the mean field sc phase transition , indicating a possibility of enhancement of afm fluctuation or order _ above _ @xmath5 .",
    "however , a closer examination of the afm critical behavior suggests the presence of an afm quantum critical point ( qcp ) _ below _",
    "in fact , measurements in the sc state of the heavy fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath4 showing a remarkably large ppb @xcite in finite magnetic fields ( @xmath9 ) clearly show the presence of afm fluctuation in the sc state which is enhanced with _ increasing _",
    "@xmath10 up to @xmath2 @xcite . a schematic picture on the afm critical fluctuation near @xmath5",
    "is represented in fig.1 .",
    "the incommensurate afm _ order _ discovered recently through neutron scattering measurements @xcite at the high field corner of the @xmath10-@xmath11 sc phase diagram of cecoin@xmath4 in @xmath12 will not be an independent event of the above - mentioned field - induced enhancement of incommensurate afm fluctuation below @xmath2 .",
    "this afm order has been detected just in the so - called high field low temperature ( hflt ) phase of this material in @xmath13 which has been previously identified @xcite with the long - sought spatially _ modulated _ fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) sc state @xcite . if focusing only on the magnetic properties seen through , e.g. , the neutron scattering data @xcite , it might be natural to identify the hflt phase with an incommensurate afm phase coexisting with the spatially uniform @xmath0-wave sc order . however , the fact that the hflt phase is destabilized by quite a small amount of not only magnetic impurities @xcite but also nonmagnetic ones @xcite is incompatible with the picture @xcite favoring the presence of the uniform @xmath0-wave sc order in the hflt phase .",
    "in fact , it has been found @xcite that such an unexpected impurity effect is consistent only with the picture identifying the hflt phase with a sc state with one - dimensional modulation parallel to @xmath14 @xcite , such as a kind of the fflo state .",
    "then , it is necessary to clarify how this fflo picture on the hflt phase is compatible with the presence of the afm order detected in the same phase .    [ 0.6 ] described schematically . for simplicity",
    ", the presence of a narrow hflt phase just below @xmath2 is neglected here ( see sec.v and vi ) .",
    "the @xmath15 ( solid ) curve below @xmath2 reflects the ppb - induced afm ordering , while the solid curve above @xmath2 results purely from the afm fluctuation in the normal state .",
    "the dotted curve below @xmath2 is the extrapolation of the high field curve to lower fields .",
    "if the @xmath2-transition ( the mean field sc transition ) is of second order so that the sc fluctuation is not negligible above @xmath2 , the growth of @xmath15 upon decreasing the field in @xmath16 should , as indicated by the dashed curve , become sharper as a consequence of the coupling between the two orderings ( see eqs.(29 ) and ( 31 ) below ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in the present work , we develop a theory comprehensively explaining the above - mentioned phenomena occurring at the high field side of the @xmath10-@xmath11 sc phase diagram of a @xmath0-wave superconductor with strong ppb such as cecoin@xmath4 . to be specific , the favorable direction of the expected staggered moment is assumed throughout this paper to be perpendicular to the basal plane , i.e. , parallel to the @xmath17-axis of the tetragonal structure of the quasi 2d sc materials according to an observation ref.@xcite on cecoin@xmath4 .",
    "it is found by extending the conventional model on coexistence of sc and afm orders to the nonzero field ( @xmath9 ) case with strong ppb that , in @xmath0-wave superconductors with strong ppb , an incommensurate afm order tends to be realized in higher fields but below @xmath5 if the afm @xmath1-vector in the commensurate limit , called @xmath18 hereafter , is parallel to the nodal direction of the sc energy gap . throughout this paper ,",
    "the component of @xmath18 in the @xmath19-@xmath20 plane of a tetragonal crystal is ( @xmath21 , @xmath21 ) so that the sc pairing state with a gap node parallel to @xmath18 is inevitably the @xmath22-paired one .",
    "this ppb - induced afm ordering or fluctuation has two crucial implications .",
    "first of all , the present afm order occurs more easily in the sc phase with finite sc energy gap than in the normal state and thus , clarifies why no situation with afm order only in the normal phase above @xmath5 is seen in those materials @xcite with an afm critical behavior around @xmath5 .",
    "second of all , since the presence or absence of the field - induced afm ordering or fluctuation strongly depends on the relative orientation between the gap node direction and @xmath18 , the present theory is also useful for addressing the pairing symmetry of those sc materials including cecoin@xmath4 : in the case with @xmath18 parallel to ( @xmath21 , @xmath21 ) , the presence of the field - induced afm fluctuation near @xmath5 implies the @xmath22-pairing symmetry of the sc material .",
    "the present field - induced afm ordering is a characteristic property of superconductors with strong ppb together with the fflo sc state and the first order @xmath2-transition @xcite , and hence , a consistent emergence of both this afm order and the fflo sc order in the same material is naturally expected .",
    "in fact , a couple of observations @xcite in the hflt phase of cecoin@xmath4 have been done so far which support identification between the hflt phase of this material and a fflo state with a modulation parallel @xcite to the applied field @xmath14 , which will be called a longitudinal fflo state hereafter @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we also examine the field - induced afm ordering in the longitudinal fflo state by invoking the pauli limit , in which the orbital pair - breaking inducing the vortices is neglected , to evaluate thermodynamics and construct a @xmath10-@xmath11 phase diagram .",
    "it is found that the fflo spatial modulation significantly extends the afm ordered region so that the situation in which the afm order is absent outside the fflo state in the phase diagram is easily realized .",
    "the obtained results on the phase diagram will be compared with recent nmr data @xcite presenting a firm evidence of _ both _ the longitudinal fflo structure and the afm order in the hflt phase of cecoin@xmath4 in @xmath13 .",
    "a preliminary report of the present work can be found in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that the presence of ppb - induced afm fluctuation has been first noticed through our numerical studies of effects of an afm quantum critical fluctuation on the vortex form factor @xcite .",
    "when we discuss the phase diagram including a field - induced afm ordering in the text , a situation with an indication of the presence of an afm qcp @xmath23 will not be distinguished from the case with a finite afm transition temperature in some field range .",
    "in fact , the field at which the afm transition temperature is the highest in the latter situation would correspond to @xmath23 if the former situation is realized , and the former is easily realized from the latter , i.e. , by reducing the strength of the electron repulsion leading to the afm ordering in the normal state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , two theoretical methods for studying the afm ordering in the @xmath0-wave superconductors are explained in details . in sec.iii and iv ,",
    "numerical results on the afm ordering following from them are presented , and their implications are explained by assuming the @xmath0-wave sc phase not to include a fflo spatial modulation . the corresponding results in a fflo phase are considered in sec.v .",
    "section vi is devoted to a summary of the present work and final remarks .",
    "in the present study , we have examined a possible afm ordering according to two approaches to be explained below . in zero magnetic field ( @xmath24 ) , our starting electronic model is the same in the two approaches and can be expressed by the hamiltonian including just the two interaction channels of a @xmath0-wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism @xmath25 , where @xmath26^\\dagger \\ , \\varepsilon_\\perp(-i \\nabla_\\perp )   \\psi_j^{(\\sigma ) } ( { \\bf r}_\\perp ) - \\frac{j}{2 } \\biggl ( [ \\psi_j^{(\\sigma)}({\\bf r}_\\perp ) ] ^\\dagger \\psi_{j+1}^{(\\sigma)}({\\bf r}_\\perp ) + { \\rm h.c . }",

    "implication of this assumption on the fixed @xmath46 will be commented on in sec.iii .",

    "\\label{mfsc}\\ ] ] here , the sc order parameter satisfying the gap equation @xmath50 was , for convenience of description , assumed to be spatially uniform .",
    "we perform the mean field analysis of @xmath51 in the following two approaches separately .",
    "one is a perturbative approach based on the microscopic derivation of a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy of a form expanded in powers of _ both _ the sc and afm order parameters .",
    "this method is useful in discussing , at least , the case with a relatively weaker ppb in which the @xmath2-transition remains second order , because the orbital pair - breaking effect of the magnetic field inducing the vortices , necessary for obtaining the second order @xmath2-transition , is included in the familiar manner .",
    "we note that the second order @xmath2-transition is not a consequence of the gl expansion in the sc order parameter , as have been demonstrated through a derivation of the first order @xmath2-transition @xcite .",
    "however , this method is insufficient for examining the detailed structure of the afm order reflecting the quasiparticle s dispersion relation .",
    "another approach is to focus on the pauli limit in which the field - induced vortices are completely neglected .",
    "the neglect of the vortices is inappropriate for considering response properties in the sc phase such as the vortex elasticity , while it may not affect evaluation of thermodynamic quantities of superconductors with strong ppb significantly .",
    "rather , the details of the afm order can be examined numerically within this approach .",
    "note that these two approaches are complementary with each other .",
    "first , let us start with explaining the perturbative approach . the quasiparticle energy incorporated in @xmath52",
    "is assumed in this approach to satisfy @xmath53 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath54 measures the incommensurability , i.e. , the deviation from the perfect nesting condition for a spin - density - wave or afm ordering , @xmath55 with the lattice constants @xmath19 ( in the @xmath56 direction ) and @xmath0 ( in the @xmath17-direction ) is the commensurate afm modulation wavevector .",
    "note that , here , @xmath54 is assumed to be a constant .",
    "the general case in which @xmath54 is @xmath57-dependent will be studied in the pauli limit approach to be given later .",
    "further , the opened fermi surface in the @xmath17-direction , i.e. , the quasi 2d nature , might become important in some electronic processes , while it is safely negligible in considering spatial variations of the order parameter fields @xmath3 in a vortex state and of @xmath39 as far as the spatial anisotropy of the sc material to be defined later is relatively small .",
    "for this reason , the order parameter fields will be assumed @xcite to be functions of a continuous spatial coordinate @xmath58 by replacing @xmath59 by @xmath60 .    regarding the green s function @xmath61 \\rangle$ ] defined in the _ normal _ state , the quasi classical approximation for @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 will be used , where @xmath64 is a fermion matsubara frequency , and @xmath65 is the inverse temperature .",
    "in diagrammatic calculations , the formula @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 will be used .",

    "is favored , or an afm qcp becomes closer with increasing @xmath10 or by an enhancement of ppb .",
    "this conclusion is not limited to the @xmath22-pairing case and is satisfied for any pairing state .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding mechanism of a ppb - induced afm ordering in the sc state in @xmath84 is peculiar to the @xmath22-pairing case and will be explained later .    to perform the @xmath57-integrals ,",

    "first , it will be clarified how spatial variation of @xmath39 should be realized in the lo structure , eq.([lodelta ] ) , of @xmath3 .",
    "it is easily understood by recalling the role of the coupling term @xmath145 in the perturbative approach that , when @xmath273 ( @xmath274 ) , the structure of the afm order parameter showing the our - of - phase ( in - phase ) modulation for the sc order parameter is the most stable , and that the spatially uniform afm order is unstable in the fflo state .",

    ", we have a couple of candidates of possible phase diagrams , and it is not easy to predict which of them should be realized in a particular material .",
    "in fact , to clarify the best candidate for cecoin@xmath4 , extensive consideration is necessary as follows .",
    "first , an experimental fact @xcite that the anomalous doping ( impurity ) effect on the second order transition in cecoin@xmath4 @xcite , indicating the presence of the fflo state above the transition @xcite , is seen entirely over the field range occupied by the hflt phase implies that cecoin@xmath4 at ambient pressure does not show realization of the phase diagram of the type of fig.12 in which a direct transition between the afm and the uniform sc phases occurs _ without _ the fflo state at lower temperatures . on the other hand , it is not easy to theoretically justify a simultaneous disappearance of the in - phase afm order , sketched in fig.11 ( 2 ) , and the fflo one at the same _ second order _",
    "transition where @xmath189 diverges : within this scenario , a simultaneous disappearance of the two orders would require a discontinuous vanishing of the afm order parameter @xmath275 in contrast to the observations in cecoin@xmath4 . for this reason , we propose two candidates , following from our microscopic calculations , of the high field phase diagram of cecoin@xmath4 in fig.10 . in ( a ) , the ppb - induced in - phase afm order , sketched in fig.11 ( 2 ) , is lost within the fflo state just above the second order transition , while the longitudinal modulation of the afm order changes from the in - phase modulation to the out - of - phase one sketched in fig.11 ( 1 ) on approaching the second order transition , as a result of the reduction of ppb .",
    "the out - of - phase afm modulation is consistent with the conventional picture @xcite that a spatial region where @xmath8 is small is occupied by a competitive non sc order . in this case , the afm order rides on the nodal planes and thus , is continuously lost through the continuous disappearance of the fflo nodal planes , while the ppb mechanism of the afm order favors the _ local _ coexistence with the sc order , i.e. , a structure like fig.11 ( 2 ) . in any case",
    ", an additional continuous transition @xcite inevitably appears within the resulting hflt phase of the theoretical phase diagrams appropriate for cecoin@xmath4 . if taking account of the consistency on the direction of afm-@xmath1 vector between the experiment @xcite and our results , fig.10 ( b ) with the diagonal @xmath42 shown in fig.8 , becomes the best candidate as the phase diagram of cecoin@xmath4 , while the electronic parameters ( see the caption of fig.10 ) resulting in fig.10 ( a ) never leads to a @xmath42 in the diagonal direction",
    "however , this correspondence between the longitudinal structure of the afm order and the detailed direction of the afm @xmath1-vector is quite a subtle issue and might be changed due to a further refinement of the starting electronic model . for this reason",
    ", it appears that we should not conclude here which of the two figures in fig.10 is more appropriate for cecoin@xmath4 .",
    "the presence of the wide fflo phase with _ no _ afm order at higher temperatures in fig.10 might indicate that the present picture on the hflt phase of cecoin@xmath4 is insufficient , because such a nonmagnetic fflo region has not been identified so far in experiments on this material .",
    "however , the present analysis in the pauli limit where @xmath276 certainly overestimated the temperature region of the fflo phase . in an improved analysis for finite @xmath224-values to be performed in future works , the fflo region unaccompanied by the afm order is certainly expected to be narrower if taking account of the orbital pair - breaking within the present approach .    here , we comment on justification of our use of the local approximation on the afm modulation .",
    "as far as the transition between the fflo and uniform sc states is of second order , this local approximation is always justified at least just above the transition because the order parameter @xcite of this transition , @xmath263 , is inversely proportional to the distance between the neighboring nodal planes which diverges at the transition . at higher fields , however , @xmath263 grows so that the neglect of the gradient terms may not be justified in general .",
    "if so , the above results in the local approximation would be quantitatively changed by the gradient terms . in the case of cecoin@xmath4",
    ", however , the presence of the strong ppb - induced afm fluctuation induces @xcite a quasiparticle damping which destabilizes the transverse fflo states to be described by _ higher _ landau level modes of the sc order parameter compared with the longitudinal fflo state , eq.([lodelta ] ) .",
    "further , this increase of the quasiparticle damping even weakens effects of ppb and results in a reduction of @xmath263 .",
    "we expect the use of the local approximation for the afm ordering to be justified in this sense .",
    "it should also be noted that the spatial variation due to the vortices in the real systems with the orbital pair - breaking has not been incorporated in this section .",
    "in fact , as in the afm ordering detected in the vortex core of high @xmath277 cuprates @xcite , it is natural to expect appearance of an afm order in the spatial region where the sc order is weaker like the vortex core . even in the present case with strong ppb ,",
    "the spatial modulation perpendicular to @xmath14 of the sc order parameter due to the vortex structure assists the afm ordering , although its effect is found to be weaker than that of the fflo modulation . on the other hand ,",
    "contrary to the event seen in cuprates @xcite , the present ppb - induced afm order tends to coexist with the sc order so that the afm order parameter value @xmath275 is maximal _ outside _ the vortex core . details of this issue will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams shown in fig.10 are comparable with that following from a recent experiment @xcite . in the nmr measurement in ref.@xcite , the presence of _ both _ the afm order and the normal state region has been detected in the hflt phase of cecoin@xmath4 at @xmath278 ( mk ) in @xmath13 , and the square - root field dependence of the quasiparticle number consistent with that of the fflo order parameter , i.e. , @xmath279 , has been found , where @xmath280 is the field at which the second order transition to the ordinary vortex lattice phase ( the uniform sc phase in the present fig.10 ) occurs .",
    "another crucial observation in ref.@xcite is that , in contrast to the picture in ref.@xcite , the observed afm order is extended spatially without being localized in a narrow spatial region .",
    "it appears that the in - phase structure in fig.11 ( 2 ) , i.e. , the coexistence of the afm and sc orders induced by ppb , is the consistent picture with this experimental fact .    in sec.iv",
    ", we have examined the direction of the modulation wave vector @xmath1 of the stable afm order originating from the ppb - induced mechanism and have found that , including its incommensurate component @xmath42 , @xmath1 can take the orientation parallel to the direction of the gap node irrespective of the @xmath14-direction in the @xmath19-@xmath20 plane . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first study giving a consistent calculation result on @xmath42 with the data @xcite in the hflt phase of cecoin@xmath4 . in relation to this",

    "recent neutron scattering experiments @xcite on cecoin@xmath4 in the field directions tilted from the @xmath19-@xmath20 plane have shown that just 17 degrees tilt of the applied field results in disappearance of the afm order present in @xmath13 .",
    "note that the focus of this experiment is the afm order and not the tilt direction signaling disappearance of the hflt phase , i.e. , of the fflo order .",
    "it is interesting to note that , according to another observation @xcite resulting from the field tilt , the hflt phase survives up to 20 degrees , suggestive of the presence of the fflo state with no afm order in a narrow high angle region . in relation to this , we point out that such an afm order disappearing separately from the fflo order due to the field tilt is not surprising from the view point of the present theory , because , as is seen by comparing fig.3 with fig.4 , the ppb - induced afm ordering in @xmath120 is much weaker than that in @xmath13 as far as , as have been assumed throughout this paper , @xmath46 is locked to the @xmath17-axis",
    ". a further theoretical study on this issue may be useful for confirming the genuine picture on the hflt phase .    in relation to this disappearance of the afm order due to the field - tilt ,",
    "a mechanism of afm ordering of cecoin@xmath4 below @xmath2 has been argued in ref.@xcite where it results from the four - fold symmetric enhancement of the density of states in the vortex lattice .",
    "however , the fermi surfaces assumed there @xcite to support the afm order are the nearly cylindrical band 15-electron ones , in the notation of ref.@xcite , with a smaller density of states , while the origin of the @xmath0-wave superconductivity and the fflo state in @xmath120 @xcite is the noncylindrical ( 3d - like ) @xcite band 14-electron fermi surface @xcite corresponding to that of fig.7 ( see the text of sec.iv ) .",
    "it is unreasonable for the fermi surface relevant to superconductivity to change with tilting the magnetic field . while preparing the final version of our manuscript , we were aware of another proposal @xcite on the afm ordering in @xmath13 below @xmath2 in which attention is paid to the zeeman - splitted nodal quasiparticles as the origin of the afm order .",
    "judging from the similarity on the starting model , the contribution mentioned in ref.@xcite to the afm ordering should be already included in the present theory with no limitation on the quasiparticles close to the gap nodes .",
    "however , we remark that focusing @xcite on the zeeman - splitted nodal quasiparticles would result in a remarkable field dependence of the incommensurate component @xmath42 of the afm wave vector @xmath1 , in contrast to our result in fig.8 consistent with the observation @xcite .",
    "further , we stress here that the argument in ref.@xcite , given in relation to fig.2 there , is also applicable to any picture @xcite identifying the experimental second order transition with a pure afm transition and thus that the doping effect @xcite leading to an extremely dramatic suppression of the transition with _ no _ notable change of the transition point to the hflt phase is incompatible with such purely afm scenarios on the second order transition ( see also sec.i ) .    in this manuscript ,",
    "we have also stressed a close relation between the @xmath1-vector of the afm order or fluctuation enhanced close to @xmath5 and the nodal direction of the @xmath0-wave sc energy gap .",
    "thus , if a novel sc material is accompanied by such an afm ordering in high fields , it may become a useful method for obtaining information on the nodal direction of the sc pairing symmetry .",
    "we wish to stress that , in contrast to measurements of the thermal conductivity @xcite and the specific heat @xcite in which experiments at very low temperatures have been necessary to determine the pairing symmetry , the present method does not require measurements at such low enough temperatures to obtain knowledge on the pairing symmetry .",

    "<S> it is theoretically shown that , in the four - fold symmetric @xmath0-wave superconducting phase , a paramagnetic pair - breaking ( ppb ) enhanced sufficiently by increasing the applied magnetic field induces not only the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) superconducting state but also an incommensurate antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order with @xmath1-vector _ parallel _ to a gap node . </S>",
    "<S> this afm ordering tends to occur only below @xmath2 at low temperatures , i.e. , in the presence of a nonvanishing superconducting energy gap @xmath3 rather than in the normal phase . through a detailed study on the resulting afm order and its interplay with the fflo spatial modulation of @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , it is argued that the strange high field and low temperature ( hflt ) superconducting phase of cecoin@xmath4 is a coexisting phase of the fflo and incommensurate afm orders , and that this ppb mechanism of an afm ordering is also the origin of the afm quantum critical fluctuation which has occurred close to @xmath5 in several unconventional superconductors including cecoin@xmath4 . </S>"
