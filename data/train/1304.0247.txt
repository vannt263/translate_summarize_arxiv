    "let @xmath0 be a set of @xmath1 points in @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the largest - empty - convex - subset problem",
    "we want to decide whether there is a set @xmath4 of @xmath5 points in convex position whose convex hull does not contain any other point of @xmath0 .",
    "we show that largest - empty - convex - subset is w[1]-hard with respect to the solution size @xmath5 , under the extra condition that the solution set is _ strictly _ convex , i.e. , the interior of the convex hull of any of its subsets is empty .",
    "this means that ( under standard complexity - theoretic assumptions ) the problem is not fixed - parameter tractable with respect to @xmath5 , i.e. , it does not admit an @xmath6-time algorithm for any computable function @xmath7 and any constant @xmath8 .",
    "see  @xcite for basic notions of parameterized complexity theory and  @xcite for survey of parameterized complexity results on geometric problems .",
    "largest - empty - convex - subset has been shown to be np - hard in last year s eurocg @xcite .",
    "( in that paper , np - hardness has been shown also for the more general version where the emptiness condition is dropped . )",
    "several interesting questions were also raised such as whether the problem is fixed - parameter tractable with respect to the solution size and whether it admits a polynomial @xmath9-approximation algorithm .",
    "here , we give a negative answer to the first question . note that in the plane , the problem is solvable in polynomial time ; see , for example , @xcite ,  @xcite .    from a combinatorial point of view",
    ", there is a long history of results starting with the famous erds - szekeres theorem @xcite , which states that for every @xmath5 there is a number @xmath10 such that every planar set of @xmath10 points in general position contains @xmath5 points in convex position .",
    "horton @xcite showed that this is not true when the emptiness condition is imposed : there are arbitrarily large sets that do not contain empty @xmath11-gons .",
    "results of this type exist also for higher dimensions ; see  @xcite .",
    "we show that largest - empty - convex - subset is w[1]-hard by an _",
    "fpt_-reduction from the w[1]-hard @xmath5-clique problem @xcite : given a graph @xmath12 , e)$ ] and @xmath3 , decide whether @xmath13 contains a clique of size @xmath5 .",
    "we begin with a high - level description of the construction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : high_level_construction ] .",
    "initially , the construction will lie on the plane ; later on , it will be lifted to the elliptic paraboloid with a ( more or less ) standard transform .",
    "the construction is organized as the upper diagonal part of a grid with @xmath5 rows and @xmath5 columns .",
    "the @xmath14th row and column represent a choice for the @xmath14th vertex of a clique in @xmath13 and are made of @xmath15 and @xmath16 gadgets respectively .",
    "there are @xmath1 choices and each choice is represented by a collection of empty convex subsets of points ",
    "one subset with a constant number of points from each gadget .",
    "each gadget consists of @xmath17 points within a rectangular region , which are organized in sets ( of pairs ) of collinear points .",
    "there is a constant number of such sets and , since we are looking for strictly convex subsets , only one pair of consecutive points per set can be chosen at any time .",
    "certain choices are rendered invalid by additional points .",
    "neighboring gadgets share the points on their common rectangle edge , see the zoomed - in area in fig  [ fig : high_level_construction ] . through these common points ,",
    "the choice of subsets is made consistent among the gadgets .",
    "in particular , the choice in the @xmath14th row is made consistent with the choice in the @xmath14th column via the ` diagonal ' , @xmath18{$\\righthalfcup$}}\\vskip-.9ex\\hbox{$\\boxvoid$}}}}$ ] gadget in their intersection corner ; consistency here means that they both correspond to the same choice of a vertex of @xmath13 . on the other hand , in the intersection of the @xmath14th column with the @xmath19th row , for every @xmath20",
    ", there is a ` cross ' , @xmath21 gadget , which ensures that the choice in the column is propagated independently of the choice in the row and vice versa .",
    "finally , the @xmath19th column is ` connected ' to the @xmath14th row , for every @xmath22 , by three additional gadgets .",
    "one of them , the ` star ' , @xmath23 gadget , encodes graph @xmath13 , i.e. , it allows only for combinations of choices ( in the column and the row ) that are consistent with the edges in @xmath13 .    locally , every valid subset from a gadget consists of points that are in strictly convex position and whose convex hull is empty . by lifting the whole construction to the paraboloid appropriately , we make sure that this property is true globally , i.e. , for any set constructed from the local choices in a consistant manner .    in total ,",
    "the construction consists of a set @xmath0 of @xmath24 points in @xmath2 , such that there exists a set @xmath4 with the desired property and @xmath25 , for some function @xmath26 , if and only if @xmath13 has a clique of size @xmath5 .",
    "it has @xmath1 pairs of points @xmath30 , @xmath31 on the left and right side of its rectangle respectively , which correspond to the vertices of @xmath13 ; pairs corresponding to the same vertex are aligned horizontally .",
    "it also has @xmath32 points inside the rectangle on a vertical line @xmath28 as follows .",
    "for every two pairs @xmath30 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , a point is placed such that it is inside the parallelogram @xmath35 formed by the pairs but outside the parallelogram formed by any other two pairs .",
    "effectively , this point cancels a choice of pairs that correspond to different vertices of @xmath13 .",
    "one point is placed above @xmath36 on @xmath28 and close to its boundary ; similarly one point is placed below @xmath37 . due to the strict convexity condition , at most one pair per rectangle side and at most one pair on @xmath28 can be chosen .",
    "thus , there are @xmath1 maximum size empty convex subsets .",
    "each subset contains six points and is formed by three pairs : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , for some @xmath14 , and the pair of points on @xmath28 that are closest to the parallelogram @xmath38 ; this latter pair is formed by the point that cancels @xmath39 and the point that cancels @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41{90}{$\\boxminusnew$}}$ ] gadget is just a @xmath42-rotated copy of the @xmath27 gadget .",

    "* this gadget has basically the same structure as the @xmath27 gadget but propagates information diagonally . for completeness",

    "as before , an @xmath14th pair corresponds to the @xmath14th vertex of @xmath13 .",
    "there will be only @xmath1 valid choices and three pairs per choice , namely , the @xmath14th pair from each side .",
    "this is enforced by the strict convexity condition and by placing , for every @xmath14 , four additional points on two vertical lines @xmath28 and @xmath45 inside the rectangle . these points are placed _",
    "outside _ the convex @xmath29-gon @xmath46 that is formed by the points in the corresponding pairs .",
    "( the points are also outside every other @xmath29-gon for @xmath47 . )",

    "[ fig : t_gadget ] .    more specifically , looking at the gadget from top to bottom and from left to right",
    ", a point is placed on the intersection of @xmath28 and the line through the second point of @xmath30 and the second point of @xmath49 ; for the case of @xmath50 , the point is placed just below the @xmath29-gon .",
    "a second point is placed on @xmath28 just above the @xmath29-gon . at the right side ,",
    "two points are placed on @xmath45 as follows .",
    "one point is placed on the intersection of @xmath45 and the line through the second point of @xmath30 and the first point of @xmath51 ; for @xmath50 , the point is placed just above the @xmath29-gon .",
    "a second point is placed on the intersection of @xmath45 and the line through the second point of @xmath31 and the first point of @xmath52 ; for @xmath53 , the point is placed just below the @xmath29-gon .",

    "a subset is formed by the points in the pairs @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath44 , and the four points on @xmath28 and @xmath45 that are closest to the corresponding @xmath29-gon .",
    "it can be thought of as having two inputs ( at the upper and lower left corner ) and two outputs ( at the upper and lower right corner ) .",
    "it propagates the inputs ( choices ) independently from each other , one horizontally and one vertically .",
    "the input subgadgets @xmath41{90}{$\\boxtriangleup$}}$ ] and @xmath41{180}{$\\boxtriangleup$}}$ ] are respectively connected ( through their left and bottom rectangle sides ) to the @xmath27 and @xmath41{90}{$\\boxminusnew$}}$ ] gadgets of the @xmath14th row and @xmath19th column of the global construction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : high_level_construction ] ) .",
    "the output subgadgets @xmath41{270}{$\\boxtriangleup$}}$ ] and @xmath57 are similarly connected to a @xmath27 and @xmath41{90}{$\\boxminusnew$}}$ ] gadget .",

    "roughly speaking , the @xmath21 gadget has the following function : it multiplexes the two inputs , then it mirrors them ( vertically and horizontally ) , and then demultiplexes them .",

    "it has again @xmath1 pairs of points @xmath30 on the left side .",
    "the difference now is that there are @xmath58 pairs of points @xmath59 , @xmath60 , on the right side of the gadget .",
    "the second index @xmath19 basically encodes the choice coming from the input subgadget @xmath41{180}{$\\boxtriangleup$}}$ ] at the lower left corner , which is communicated through the @xmath54 and @xmath41{90}{${\\mathrel { \\vcenter{\\offinterlineskip \\hbox{\\scalebox{.76}[0.85]{$\\righthalfcup$}}\\vskip-.9ex\\hbox{$\\boxvoid$}}}}$}}$ ] subgadgets inbetween . only the @xmath58 pairs @xmath30 and @xmath59 constitute valid choices .",
