    "the spacetime geometry is determined by the metric tensor @xmath4 , and the dynamics of the metric tensor is determined by einstein s equations . for a given metric tensor there exists an infinity of tetrad fields @xmath5 that are compatible with the spacetime geometry .",
    "tetrad fields may be interpreted as reference frames adapted to a class of observers in spacetime .",
    "einstein s equations may be written in the traditional form in terms of the metric tensor , in which case the curvature tensor plays a prominent role , or in terms of the tetrad field . in the latter case",
    "the field equations are constructed out of the torsion tensor .",
    "therefore the dynamics of the gravitational field admits a description either in terms of the curvature tensor ( of the levi - civita connection ) , or of the torsion tensor ( of the weitzenbck connection ) @xcite .",
    "however , there is a point of view according to which the gravitational force that acts on a particle or on a frame , in a given gravitational field , is due to the torsion tensor only , not to the spacetime curvature .",
    "of course the curvature tensor is responsible for the tidal forces , but the force on a particle that moves along a particular geodesic worldline @xmath6 , with tangent vector @xmath7 , is due to the torsion tensor .",
    "this is one of the issues discussed by schucking @xcite , and we will address it in this paper , in some detail , in terms of the acceleration tensor .",
    "this tensor is a coordinate invariant quantity that describes the accelerations that are necessary to maintain a reference frame in spacetime in a given inertial state ( for instance , to maintain the frame in stationary state ) .",
    "the reference frame is fixed by identifying the timelike components of the inverse tetrad field with the velocity field of the class of observers , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "a second issue to be considered here is the interpretation of the pound - rebka experiment as a manifestation of the spacetime torsion , as suggested by schucking @xcite .",
    "suppose that at the top of a tower , at a distance @xmath1 from the center of the earth a light signal is emitted radially downwards at the instant @xmath9 , and received at a position @xmath3 at the instant @xmath10 .",
    "after a proper time interval @xmath0 a second light signal is emitted downwards , and is received at the position @xmath3 at the instant @xmath11 .",
    "it is known that timelike and null vectors formed by the events @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 do not form a parallelogram in the ( t , r ) plane .",
    "the nonclosure of the parallelogram may be interpreted as a manifestation of the torsion of the spacetime . by establishing the frame of stationary observers in the schwarzschild spacetime",
    "we arrive at the torsion tensor that precisely explains the breaking of the parallelogram .",
    "this issue will be investigated in detail in the present analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the construction of the acceleration tensor .",
    "the values of this tensor characterize the inertial state of the frame , i.e. , it provides the nongravitational accelerations ( translational and angular velocity of the local spatial frame with respect to a nonrotating fermi - walker transported frame ) that are exerted on the frame . in section 3",
    "we discuss the possibility of having a situation in which the curvature tensor approaches zero , whereas the geodesic ( gravitational ) acceleration of a particle may acquire arbitrary values .",
    "the geodesic acceleration is related to some components of the acceleration tensor ( constructed out of the torsion tensor ) for a stationary frame in spacetime . in section 4",
    "we consider the pound - rebka experiment and explain the breaking of the parallelogram in terms of the spacetime torsion .",
    "we conclude that the torsion tensor is an important entity in the description of the spacetime geometry and of the gravitational field .",
    "notation : space - time indices @xmath16 and so(3,1 ) indices @xmath17 run from 0 to 3 .",
    "time and space indices are indicated according to @xmath18 .",
    "the tetrad field is denoted @xmath5 , and the torsion tensor reads @xmath19 .",
    "the flat , minkowski space - time metric tensor raises and lowers tetrad indices and is fixed by @xmath20 .",
    "the determinant of the tetrad field is represented by @xmath21 .",
    "the torsion tensor defined above is often related to the object of anholonomity @xmath22 via @xmath23 .",
    "however , we assume that the spacetime geometry is defined by the tetrad field only , and in this case the only possible nontrivial definition for the torsion tensor is given by @xmath24 .",
    "this torsion tensor is related to the antisymmetric part of the weitzenbck connection @xmath25 , which is frame dependent and establishes the weitzenbck spacetime .",
    "the curvature of the weitzenbck connection vanishes .",
    "however , the tetrad field also yields the metric tensor , which establishes the riemannian geometry .",
    "therefore in the framework of a geometrical theory based only on the tetrad field one may use the concepts of both riemannian and weitzenbck geometries .",
    "we recall the discussion presented in refs . @xcite regarding the characterization of tetrad fields as reference frames in spacetime . a frame may be characterized in a coordinate invariant way by its inertial accelerations , represented by the acceleration tensor .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the worldline @xmath26 of an observer in spacetime , where @xmath27 is the proper time of the observer .",
    "the velocity of the observer on @xmath26 reads @xmath7 .",
    "we identify the observer s velocity with the @xmath28 component of @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "the acceleration @xmath31 of the observer is given by the absolute derivative of @xmath32 along @xmath26 @xcite ,    @xmath33    where the covariant derivative is constructed out of the christoffel symbols .",
    "thus @xmath29 and its derivatives determine the velocity and acceleration along the worldline of an observer .",
    "the set of tetrad fields for which @xmath34 describe a congruence of timelike curves is adapted to a class of observers characterized by the velocity field @xmath35 and by the acceleration @xmath31 .",
    "we may consider not only the acceleration of observers along trajectories whose tangent vectors are given by @xmath34 , but the acceleration of the whole frame along @xmath26 .",
    "the acceleration of the frame is determined by the absolute derivative of @xmath29 along the path @xmath6 .",
    "thus , assuming that the observer carries an orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath29 , the acceleration of the latter along the path is given by @xcite    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the antisymmetric acceleration tensor .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in analogy with the faraday tensor we can identify @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the translational acceleration ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 is the angular velocity of the local spatial frame with respect to a nonrotating ( fermi - walker transported ) frame .",
    "it follows that    @xmath42    therefore given any set of tetrad fields for an arbitrary gravitational field configuration , its geometrical interpretation may be obtained by suitably interpreting the velocity field @xmath43 and the acceleration tensor @xmath37 .",
    "the acceleration vector @xmath31 defined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) may be projected on a frame in order to yield    @xmath44    thus @xmath31 and @xmath45 are not different accelerations of the frame .    the acceleration @xmath31 given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) may be rewritten as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 are the christoffel symbols .",
    "thus if @xmath35 represents a geodesic trajectory , then the frame is in free fall and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore we conclude that nonvanishing values of @xmath45 represent inertial accelerations of the frame .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we take into account the orthogonality of the tetrads and write eq . ( 3 ) as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "next we consider the identity @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the metric compatible levi - civita connection , and express @xmath53 according to    @xmath54    finally we take into account the identity @xmath55 , where @xmath56 are the ricci rotation coefficients defined by    @xmath57    and @xmath58 .",
    "after simple manipulations we arrive at    @xmath59    the expression above is not invariant under local so(3,1 ) transformations , and for this reason the values of @xmath37 may characterize the frame . however , eq .",
    "( 8) is invariant under coordinate transformations .",
    "we interpret @xmath37 as the inertial accelerations of the frame along the trajectory @xmath26 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we applied definition ( 8) to the analysis of two simple configurations of tetrad fields in the flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "we considered the frame adapted to linearly accelerated observers , and to a stationary frame whose four - velocity is @xmath60 and which rotates around the @xmath61 axis . the components @xmath45 and @xmath62 yield the known values of the translational acceleration and of the angular velocity of the frame , respectively . as we will see in section 3 , in suitable situations the values of @xmath45 which are necessary to maintain a frame in stationary state exactly cancel the geodesic acceleration exerted on a particle or observer in spacetime .",
    "in order to obtain the radial geodesic acceleration of @xmath63 a particle in the schwarzschild spacetime , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will address a more general situation , namely , we will obtain the inertial accelerations that are necessary to impart to a frame such that it remains stationary in spacetime .",
    "the schwarzschild spacetime is described by the line element    @xmath64    a field of stationary observers in spacetime is characterized by a vector field @xmath32 such that @xmath65 , i.e. , the spatial components of @xmath32 vanish .",
    "thus in the construction of the tetrad field we require    @xmath66    in view of the orthogonality of the tetrad components this condition implies @xmath67 .",
    "a simple form of @xmath68 in @xmath69 coordinates that satisfies this property and yields ( 9 ) is given by    @xmath70    where    @xmath71    in ( 11 ) @xmath72 and @xmath73 label lines and rows , respectively .",
    "it is possible to show that in the asymptotic limit @xmath74 the inverse tetrad components in @xmath75 coordinates satisfy    @xmath76    we proceed now to determine the acceleration tensor @xmath37 . after a number of manipulations we find that ( 11 ) represents a nonrotating frame ,",
    "i.e. ,    @xmath77    altogether , conditions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) fix the orientation of the frame in spacetime .",
    "the translational acceleration , however , is nonvanishing . from definition",
    "( 8) we find    @xmath78    for @xmath28 the only nonvanishing component of @xmath79 is @xmath80 .",
    "the equation above yields    @xmath81    from what follows    @xmath82    we define the acceleration    @xmath83    which may be written as    @xmath84    equation ( 19 ) represents the inertial acceleration necessary to maintain the frame in stationary state in spacetime .",
    "therefore it exactly cancels the geodesic acceleration that is exerted on the frame .",
    "in fact ,    @xmath85    is precisely the geodesic acceleration obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of cartan s structural equations or , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite by taking the absolute derivative ( according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) of the velocity of a body in free fall in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we note , however , that eq .",
    "( 15 ) ( and consequently ( 19 ) ) is invariant under coordinate transformations .",
    "now we analise a very interesting consequence of eq .",
    "( 20 ) , considering that the acceleration @xmath72 is kept constant .",
    "equation ( 20 ) is a quadratic equation for the mass @xmath86 , which can be written as    @xmath87    solving this equation for @xmath86 we find    @xmath88    which , after simple manipulations , leads to    @xmath89\\ , .",

    "thus in this limit we have    @xmath97    which implies @xmath98 .",
    "however the component of the curvature tensor ( of the levi - civita connection ) in the @xmath99 plane is given by @xcite    @xmath100    therefore , in view of eq .",
    "( 27 ) , in the limit when both @xmath96 and @xmath101 the curvature tensor vanishes ,    @xmath102    thus we see that if ( i ) @xmath96 and ( ii ) @xmath103 , then the curvature tensor approaches zero whereas the geodesic acceleration @xmath72 may acquire arbitrary values .",
    "this is not a realistic physical situation , but it proves that the curvature tensor is not responsible for the geodesic acceleration given by ( 20 ) .",
    "this is the argument presented by schucking @xcite : there may exist gravitational field configurations such that the curvature tensor approaches zero , whereas the geodesic acceleration may acquire arbitrary values .",
    "the action of gravity on a particle that undergoes geodesic acceleration is not affected by the vanishing value of the curvature tensor .",
    "as we have seen , the geodesic acceleration may be obtained from the acceleration tensor given by eq .",
    "( 8) , and the latter is constructed out of the torsion tensor , which is ultimately responsible for the geodesic acceleration .",
    "we note that it is impossible to write eq .",
    "( 8) in terms of the curvature tensor .",
    "the relevance of the torsion tensor to the spacetime geometry is revealed by the pound - rebka experiment @xcite .",
    "let us consider the emission of two radial light signals at the position @xmath104 to the position @xmath105 , in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "at the position @xmath104 the time elapsed between the first and second signals is the proper time @xmath106 , and at @xmath105 the second signal is received after a proper time @xmath107 . as in the previous section , we assume that the schwarzschild spacetime is described the coordinates @xmath69 . in this case",

    "( 31 ) is the result of the pound - rebka experiment @xcite , which may be described in figure 1 .        in figure 1 the vectors @xmath113 and @xmath114 are null vectors that represent the light signals .",
    "null vectors satisfy the condition @xmath115 . for radial null vectors we have @xmath116 , and therefore @xmath117 . in the schwarzschild spacetime",
    "we have @xmath118 .",
    "thus a radial null vector in the schwarzschild spacetime may be written as @xmath119 .",
    "the vectors @xmath120 and @xmath121 in figure 1 have dimension of length . except for the factor @xmath122 ( the speed of light ) ,",
    "the zero components of these vectors represent the time elapsed between two events .",
    "the time elapsed between @xmath123 and @xmath124 is @xmath125 , and between @xmath126 and @xmath127 is @xmath128 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath129    let us denote @xmath130 the time elapsed between the events @xmath131 and @xmath124 , or between @xmath126 and @xmath123 .",
    "we write    @xmath132    however , ingoing radial null geodesics in the schwarzschild spacetime satisfy ( see , for instance , section 16.4 of @xcite )    @xmath133    thus , @xmath134 , and finally we have    @xmath135    the breaking of the parallelogram in figure 1 is verified by the following operation ,    @xmath136    the nonclosure of the parallelogram can also be obtained by means of an alternative procedure .",
    "let us consider two infinitesimal vectors , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , as in figure 2 below .        the parallel transport of @xmath139 along @xmath140 , and of @xmath141 along @xmath142 are given by , respectively ,    @xmath143    where @xmath144 is a spacetime connection with torsion .",
    "the nonclosure of the parallelogram is obtained as follows ,    @xmath145    as in the previous section , the schwarzschild spacetime is described by the set of tetrad fields given by ( 11 ) , i.e. , by stationary observers in spacetime . without going into details of calculations",
    "we just assert that the frame determined by ( 11 ) yields only three components of the torsion tensor @xmath146 ( note that there are six nonvanishing components of @xmath79 ) ,    @xmath147    now we identify    @xmath148    it is straightforward to verify that    @xmath149    as a consequence of eq .",
    "( 39 ) no other breaking of parallelogram takes place in the @xmath99 plane of figure 1 . taking into account eq .",
    "( 30 ) , we may also write    @xmath150    in view of the agreement between eqs . ( 36 ) and ( 41 ) we conclude that the reference frame determined by ( 11 ) is indeed suitable to describe the emergence of torsion in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we have investigated two manifestations of torsion in the schwarzschild spacetime in the framework of a set of tetrad fields adapted to stationary observers . in order to maintain a frame in stationary state in spacetime",
    "it is necessary to impart to the frame a translational , inertial acceleration that exactly cancels the gravitational , geodesic acceleration . by means of the acceleration tensor defined by eq .",
    "( 8) , which is a coordinate invariant definition , we have obtained the inertial acceleration and consequently the geodesic acceleration on a radial trajectory .",
    "the investigation of the expression of the geodesic acceleration led to the conclusion that for certain values of @xmath86 and @xmath105 in the schwarzschild spacetime the curvature tensor approaches zero , whereas the geodesic accceleration may acquire arbitrary values .",
    "we concluded that it is the torsion tensor ( of the weitzenbck connection ) , and not the curvature tensor ( of the levi - civita connection ) that is responsible for the geodesic acceleration of a particle .",
    "the same set of tetrad fields ( eq . ( 11 ) ) explains the pound - rebka experiment in terms of breaking of parallelogram , as in figure 1 .",
    "the set of tetrad fields given by ( 11 ) yields the torsion tensor components ( 39 ) , which are crucial to the agreement between ( 36 ) ( the nonclosure of the parallelogram directly from the pound - rebka experiment ) and ( 41 ) ( the breaking of the parallelogram obtained by parallel transport ) .",
    "@xmath151 for which @xmath152 is an arbitrary function of the radial coordinate @xmath105 .",
    "this class of spacetime metrics includes , for instance , the schwarzschild - de sitter and the reissner - nordstrom spacetimes .",
    "let us briefly consider the de sitter spacetime .",
    "we have @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is related to the positive cosmological constant @xmath155 by means of @xmath156 . by repeating the analysis of section 3 it follows from eqs .",

    "once again we see that the values of the acceleration tensor have no direct relationship to the curvature tensor .            where @xmath163 ( obtained in the frame of stationary observers ) is given by ( 39 ) ?",
    "since @xmath163 is antisymmetric in the @xmath164 indices , the geodesic equations obtained from connections ( 44 ) and ( 45 ) are the same .",
    "@xmath163 does not affect the standard geodesic motion of particles in spacetime , and not any of the experimental tests of general relativity .",
    "moreover we note that in the limit @xmath165 the three torsion components in eq .",
    "( 39 ) fall off as @xmath166 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath163 is relevant to small scale gravitational phenomena . however , ( 45 ) is not a metric compatible connection , as it leads to @xmath167 .",
