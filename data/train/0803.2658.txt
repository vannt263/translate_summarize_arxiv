    "the subject of deformed quantum field theories has attracted renewed attention in recent years due to their natural appearance in string theory .",
    "initial studies were devoted to theories on non - commutative spacetime in which the commutator of the spacetime co - ordinates becomes non - zero .",
    "more recently@xcite-@xcite , non - anticommutative supersymmetric theories have been constructed by deforming the anticommutators of the grassman co - ordinates @xmath2 ( while leaving the anticommutators of the @xmath3 unaltered ) .",
    "consequently , the anticommutators of the supersymmetry generators @xmath4 are deformed while those of the @xmath5 are unchanged .",
    "non - anticommutative versions of the wess - zumino model and supersymmetric gauge theories have been formulated in four dimensions@xcite and their renormalisability discussed@xcite-@xcite , with explicit computations up to two loops@xcite for the wess - zumino model and one loop for gauge theories@xcite-@xcite .",
    "more recently still , non - anticommutative theories in two dimensions have been considered . on the one hand non - anticommutative versions of particular non - linear @xmath1-models",
    "have been constructed ( by dimensional reduction from four dimensions)@xcite and the one - loop corrections computed@xcite ; on the other hand a non - anticommutative version of the general @xmath0 khler @xmath1-model has been constructed directly in two dimensions , initially in refs .",
    "@xcite but then given an elegant reformulation in refs .",
    "we shall predominantly follow the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the deformation was interpreted as a `` smearing '' of the khler potential .",
    "the undeformed @xmath0 khler @xmath1-model and its renormalisation were studied exhaustively in the context of string theory .",
    "it was thought for a while that its only divergences were at the one - loop level where they can be interpreted as a correction to the khler metric of the form of the ricci tensor ; until explicit calculations@xcite revealed a divergence at the four - loop level .",
    "the motivation for the present work was to investigate whether the one - loop corrections in the deformed theory as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite would exhibit a similar `` smearing '' as in the classical theory .",
    "it turns out that the number of one - loop diagrams in the deformed theory is enormous , at least in the component formulation in which we work ; however , they can be expressed in terms of differential operators implementing the undeformed supersymmetry generators @xmath6 ( using light - cone co - ordinates in two dimensions ) , acting on a simpler `` kernel '' .",
    "now in fact , the undeformed classical action ( in its component form ) can be expressed simply as the product of the operators representing _ all _ the supersymmetry generators , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , acting on the khler potential .",
    "this inspired the hope that in the non - anticommutative case , if we could construct the operators implementing the deformed supersymmetry generators @xmath7 , we might be able to obtain a similarly succinct form for the deformed one - loop corrections .",
    "accordingly , we start by giving an exact construction for these operators to all orders in the deformation parameter .",
    "we then give our results for the one - loop calculation , expressed in a relatively compact form in terms of the undeformed operators for @xmath6 acting on a kernel @xmath8 .",
    "it is then easy to see that unfortunately it is impossible to further write @xmath8 in a shorter form using the operators representing @xmath7 .",

    "accordingly , we decided to perform the calculation in the uneliminated component formulation .",
    "however , it rapidly becomes apparent that there is a plethora of diagrams to consider .",

    "( [ eq : defact ] ) .",
    "we then realised that the divergent contributions from this set of graphs ( numbering about 200 ) could be expressed much more concisely as @xmath58 for some @xmath8 ( which we call a kernel ) . with this as a guide , we were then able to construct the corresponding @xmath8 for the full set of one - loop @xmath53 diagrams , explicitly computing only a small subset of these to serve as a check .",
    "of course , this is reminiscent of the fact remarked on earlier that in the undeformed case the one - loop quantum corrections may be written in terms of @xmath37 .",
    "the full kernel , @xmath59 , is displayed in the appendix using a convenient diagrammatic notation .",
    "it is tempting to wonder if the analogy with the undeformed case goes further so that we may write s_b^(1)=d^2x q_-q_+_-_+^(1)_b [ barform ] for some underlying @xmath60 , where @xmath38 are the deformed operators constructed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullqa ] ) ; indeed this was our motivation for constructing these operators in the first instance .",
    "unfortunately this turns out not to be the case , as is easily seen : focussing on the set of graphs in @xmath61 with five vertices , four with a single fermion and one with an @xmath30 , it can be seen that the graphs with six vertices , five with one fermion and one with an @xmath30 , ( and no derivatives ) created by the action of @xmath62 on this set do not cancel . in drawing this conclusion",
    "we can restrict attention to the effect of @xmath63 since the remaining terms in @xmath64 all contain derivatives . since this is the only source of graphs of this type in @xmath65",

    ". this immediately implies ( due once again to the nilpotency of @xmath38 ) that @xmath73 can not be of the form eq .",
    "( [ barform ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the classical behaviour is not reproduced at the quantum level , and in particular that the one - loop effective action is not invariant under @xmath38 , even though the classical action was .",
    "we have constructed differential operators which express the non - anticommutative supersymmetry according to = q_,=_and which therefore reproduce the deformed algebra in eq .",

    "however , we then examined the one - loop effective action and showed that although we could express the one - loop divergences as s_b^(1)=d^2x q_-q_+^(1)_b , it was not possible in turn to write @xmath76 for some @xmath77 . correspondingly , although @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , an invariance of the classical action can be shown to lead directly to an invariance of the quantum effective action only in simple cases , namely for linear transformations of the fields ; such as , indeed , the transformations corresponding to @xmath18 . in the case of",
    "non - linear transformations , the transformation properties of the effective action are expressed through ward identities . in the case at hand ,",
    "the effect of @xmath38 on a single field is in fact linear , though the effect on functions of the fields is more complicated .",
    "the fact that @xmath80 implies @xmath78 is therefore easy to understand .",
    "however , it would also be interesting to try to prove to all orders the stronger statement , that @xmath81 for an appropriate @xmath34 , which we have shown to be valid at one loop and first order in @xmath53 .",
    "our original motivation in embarking on this calculation was to see if the `` smearing '' of the classical geometry was mirrored at the quantum level .",
    "this seems unlikely in view of the non - renormalisability of the theory , manifested here by the appearance of divergent terms in the one - loop effective action with , for instance , 6 fermion fields ; and in fact one can obtain divergent diagrams with arbitrary numbers of external legs by inserting chains of deformed vertices of indefinite length into appropriate `` propagators '' in a given divergent diagram .",
    "the @xmath82 gauge theory in four dimensions , albeit power - counting non - renormalisable , turned out to have only a finite number of types of counterterm .",
    "this property is associated with the non - hermiticity of the theory , a generic feature of these deformed supersymmetric theories ; but in the four - dimensional case this can be codified as a kind of r - parity@xcite which severely restricts the types of counterterm ; presumably such an effect is absent in two dimensions .",
    "the combination of non - renormalisability and the novel form of the invariance seems likely to preclude the possibility of obtaining a succinct form of the quantum effective action which could be interpreted in terms of a modification of the ( smeared ) background geometry , though it would be interesting to investigate this further .",
    "of course , although we committed ourselves to working in the component formulation , believing the superspace computation of quantum corrections to be very unwieldy in the nonanticommutative case , this alternative might be worth pursuing to see if a simpler form of the results might be achieved thereby .",
