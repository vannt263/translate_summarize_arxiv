    "( 4 ) is reasonable for mid - shell nuclei .",
    "however , at shell closures , the ground states of the nuclei @xmath0 and @xmath29 are expected to be quite different and the anomalous density is zero due to the collapse of static pairing correlations .",
    "it can thus be interesting to check especially in these regions the validity of such an approximation .",
    "the pair - transfer probability calculated by using the amplitude given by eq .",
    "( [ apprgs ] ) is written as @xmath41      an alternative formulation can be developed in the canonical basis formalism .",

    "the corresponding occupation number is denoted by @xmath45 , where @xmath0 is the mass of the nucleus .",
    "accounting for the convention for the time - reversed states used in ref .",
    "@xcite we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the operators introduced in the bogoliubov transformations .",
    "these equation can eventually be inverted to give @xmath48 in the canonical basis , the hfb quasiparticle ground state takes a bcs - like form , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in what follows ,",
    "we consider the addition pair - transfer probability ; the expression for the removal probability can be derived in the same way .",
    "we have : @xmath51 similarly to what is done in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the previous section , one can eventually assume that @xmath52 can be replaced by @xmath53 . by taking advantage of the fact that the single - particle states are canonical and by using the properties relating time - reversed states",
    ", one finally deduces that    @xmath54    in the special case considered here , where the nucleus is assumed spherical , we finally obtain @xmath55    where @xmath56 stands for the radial part of the canonical basis component .",
    "this expression provides an alternative form of the transition amplitude and its numerical estimate should exactly match with the one obtained with eq .",
    "interestingly enough , in this specific basis , the radial dependence of the wave function completely disappears in the transition probability @xmath57 or , equivalently , in spherical symmetry , @xmath58      in fig .",
    "[ fig : matsuo ] , the removal ( or addition ) probabilities obtained by using eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 15 ) are compared for the sn isotopic chain and the two different employed pairing interactions .",
    "for the surface case , the nucleus @xmath59sn corresponds to the drip line nucleus ( the two - neutron separation energy changes its sign going from @xmath59sn to @xmath60sn in this case ) .    ) and for the mixed pairing case ( blue solid line ) and the pure surface case ( red dashed line ) .",
    "the results obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : pacan ] ) are also shown for the mixed ( filled circles ) and pure surface ( blue filled squares ) case , width=302 ]    as can be seen in this figure , the two sets of results can almost be superposed one to the other , as it should be if a full basis was used in both formulations .",
    "the small difference is due to the fact that in both cases the actual calculation is made with a set of states below a certain cutoff .",
    "the cutoff used in the quasiparticle space case can not be easily connected to the cutoff in canonical single - particle space .",
    "therefore , the inevitable slightly different cutoff choices lead to the ( very ) small difference .",
    "the surface - peaked pairing interaction systematically provides a larger probability .",
    "we notice that the transfer probability is zero in this approximation for the magic nuclei @xmath61sn and @xmath62sn due to the absence of static pairing correlation in these cases .",
    "the canonical basis formulation of the pair transfer gives an interesting new insight in the interpretation of the transfer probability .",
    "indeed , the differences between the pair - transfer probabilities which are obtained with different pairing forces are usually interpreted as a consequence of the radial features of the quasiparticle wave functions that appear in the integral of eq .",
    ". one may wonder whether this is an artificial result depending on the technical details of the hfb calculations , where integrals of the components of the quasiparticle wave functions are done to evaluate the probability .",
    "however , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pacan ] ) , the radial dependence of the canonical - state wave functions is integrated out and completely disappears .",
    "we can thus argue that the differences in the transition probabilities are not artificial and certainly contain genuine physical effects .",
    "these effects that lead to a larger transfer probability for the case of a pure surface interaction with respect to the case of a mixed interaction could be seen ( in the canonical basis formulation where the probability is expressed in terms of occupation numbers ) as due to a different neutron occupancy fragmentation around the fermi energy .",
    "the neutron occupation numbers around the fermi energy are more fragmented in the case of a surface pairing interaction ; in this latter case the fermi energy is also closer to zero meaning that the system is less bound .",
    "this indicates that the last occupied states are closer to the continuum .",
    "this is illustrated in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] where the neutron fermi energy @xmath63 is displayed as a function of @xmath0 for both interactions .        to estimate in a systematic way the fragmentation of the single - particle occupancies , the single - particle entropy , defined as @xmath64 is shown as a function of @xmath0 in the lower panel of fig .",
    "the more spreading of occupation number , the larger should be this quantity . a larger fragmentation of the occupation numbers implies a more diffuse fermi surface and thus more important surface effects .     for the tin isotopic chain for mixed ( filled circles ) and surface ( filled squares ) pairing case .",
    ", width=302 ]    this figure illustrates that the trend of the entropy is actually comparable to the trend of the strength . in both cases the results obtained with the surface - peaked pairing interaction are systematically larger than the values associated to a mixed interaction .",
    "it is worth spending some words about the trend of the square of the pairing gap @xmath65 as a function of @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors compare @xmath65 and the pair - transfer strength in sn isotopes .",
    "they expect that these quantities should be proportional . by comparing their results",
    ", they actually observe that the two quantities have the same trend but that they are not proportional : the surface enhancement effect beyond the isotope @xmath66sn ( in their case the drip line for the surface interaction is shifted to heavier isotopes with respect to the present calculations ) is more strongly visible in the pair - transfer probability than in @xmath65 .",
    "we believe that the pair - transfer strength and the square of the pairing gap can not be directly compared .",
    "these two quantities can not scale in the same way since they are obtained by integrating different functions .",
    "furthermore , the comparison depends also on the adopted definition of the pairing gap which is not unique . in ref .",
    "@xcite the expression @xmath67 is employed , where @xmath34 is the anomalous density .",
    "another definition is also currently used @xcite , namely , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the particle density .    to clarify the connection between @xmath70 and @xmath71 on one side and between these quantities and the pair - transfer probabilities on the other side ,",
    "let us go back to the canonical basis representation .",
    "the two gap expressions are @xmath72 where @xmath73",
    "we see that only if @xmath74 for any couples of states around the fermi energy , we have : @xmath75 such a condition is very unlikely .",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 mix in a different way radial effects and fragmentation of occupation numbers showing again that these quantities can not _ a priori _ directly be connected one to the other and to transfer properties .    in the case of a mixed pairing interaction the two definitions of @xmath70",
    "are expected to provide similar results because the radial localizations of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are not very different .",
    "the case of a surface - peaked pairing interaction is however different . due to the very different radial profiles of the anomalous and particle densities",
    "the two gaps may be quite different in this latter case .",
    "in particular , if the expression of eq .",
    "( [ doba ] ) is used , the pairing gap can have a very different behavior than the pair transition probability .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "3 where one sees that the surface - case @xmath65 is lower than the volume - case @xmath65 ( inversed behavior with respect to the transfer probability ) between the isotopes @xmath61sn and @xmath62sn .",
    "to obtain the expression ( [ eq : matsuo ] ) or ( [ eq : pacan ] ) , it has been necessary to assume that @xmath78 which is at variance with the original prescription @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how to obtain , in the framework of the hfb model , a formulation similar to that advanced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we do not adopt the approximation used in last section and write explicitly the bogoliubov transformations in the amplitudes for the removal and addition transitions .",
    "for the removal amplitude this means ,    @xmath79    an analogous expression may be written for the addition amplitude . to explicitly evaluate the matrix elements of the operators",
    "@xmath80 we have to adopt the following approximations :    @xmath81    and thus obtain for the removal and addition amplitudes    @xmath82    the improvement with respect to the previous derivation is achieved by actually making the approximation @xmath83 on the matrix elements of the creation / annihilation operators @xmath84 .",
    "that is , the approximation is done after having written and explicitly applied the bogoliubov transformations in the expression of the transition amplitudes.this leads to expressions where the wave functions of the two nuclei appear as originally used in ref .",

    "the case of figure [ fig : impsurf ] is different .",
    "we observe some irregularities in the trend of the results which have been obtained with eq .",
    "( [ eq : marcella ] ) .",
    "these irregularities are related to some specific features of the hfb calculations in coordinate representation .",
    "it may happen that the fragmentation of the occupations among the discretized quasiparticle states ( box boundary conditions with a box radius equal to 20 fm ) is not the same in the nucleus @xmath1 and in the nucleus @xmath0 .",
    "when this is the case , some irregularities appear in the transfer strength calculated by making products of functions belonging to the different nuclei @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this situation does not occur when one uses the canonical basis , that displays a smoother behavior when moving from one system to the neighbor one .",

    "the quasiparticle states which are generally used to estimate pair - transfer probabilities are not eigenstates of the particle number operator . in particular , a state @xmath91 contains not only components with the correct number of particles , but also components with particle numbers @xmath92 , @xmath93 , ... inducing spurious contributions to the probabilities .",
    "these contributions can be exactly removed using projection techniques . in the following , it is assumed that the ground state of a system with particle number @xmath0 is written as @xmath94 denotes the projector onto the number of particles @xmath0 .",
    "the projected state has the particularity that it has the same canonical basis as the original quasiparticle vacuum from which it is constructed .",
    "as shown in appendix [ sec : appa ] , the transition probability accounting for particle number projection can now be approximately estimated by replacing occupation numbers of the quasi - particle state @xmath95 in eqs .",

    "the same surface effects which are due to the integrated radial profiles of the contributing wave functions in the quasiparticle representation still exist in the canonical basis case as a consequence of the different fragmentation of the single - particle canonical occupancies .",

    "<S> approximations made to estimate two - nucleon transfer probabilities in ground - state to ground - state transitions and physical interpretation of these probabilities are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> probabilities are often calculated by approximating both ground states , of the initial nucleus @xmath0 and of the final nucleus @xmath1 by the same quasiparticle vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze two improvements of this approach . </S>",
    "<S> first , the effect of using two different ground states with average numbers of particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 is quantified . </S>",
    "<S> second , by using projection techniques , the role of particle number restoration is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the improved treatment plays a role close to magicity , leading to an enhancement of the pair - transfer probability . in mid - shell regions , part of the error made by approximating the initial and final ground states by a single vacuum </S>",
    "<S> is compensated by projecting onto good particle number . </S>",
    "<S> surface effects are analyzed by using pairing interactions with a different volume - to - surface mixing . finally , </S>",
    "<S> a simple expression of the pair - transfer probability is given in terms of occupation probabilities in the canonical basis . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the canonical basis formulation , surface effects which are visible in the transfer probability are related to the fragmentation of single - particle occupancies close to the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a complementary interpretation with respect to the standard quasiparticle representation where surface effects are generated by the integrated radial profiles of the contributing wave functions </S>",
