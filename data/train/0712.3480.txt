    "most central stars of planetary nebulae have a hydrogen - rich atmosphere ; their optical spectra show only weak absorption lines , mainly of hydrogen and helium . in drastic contrast",
    ", there is another class of central stars whose spectra are characterized by strong emission lines of carbon , helium and oxygen . very much like in the case of the populationi wolf - rayet stars ,",
    "these spectra emerge from a fast and dense stellar wind .",
    "the spectral type of these hydrogen - deficient central stars is denoted as [ wc ] , where the c indicates the dominance of carbon lines , while the brackets should distinguish them from their massive counterparts .",
    "the [ wc ] class is divided into a sequence of subtypes , from [ wc2 ] to [ wc11 ] ( a more recent scheme introduces also subtypes [ wo1 - 4 ] ) .",
    "the subtypes [ wc2 - 5 ] are referred to as `` early '' types or [ wce ] , while [ wc6 - 11 ] subtypes are considered as `` late '' , briefly [ wcl ] . [ wce ] types show lines of c , he and oxygen , whereas late - type spectra are dominated by c , c and c. hence , the sequence of decreasing subtype number corresponds to increasing ionization , and therefore increasing effective temperature .",
    "if central stars evolve directly from the agb to the white dwarf stage , they should first become [ wcl ] and then [ wce ] subtypes .",
    "it is generally adopted that [ wc]-type central stars have lost their hydrogen envelope in a last thermal pulse following the agb evolution . however , it is not clear whether this last thermal pulse occurred when the star is still on the agb ( agb final thermal pulse , aftp ) , or as a `` late '' or `` very late '' thermal pulse ( ltp or vltp , respectively ) , which brings the star back to the beginning of the post - agb track a second time ( born - again scenario ) . detailed calculations ( herwig @xcite ) predict that the surface composition after an ltp and vltp resembles the former intershell abundances ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ltpabundances ] ) . in the case of the vltp",
    "the star has almost reached the white dwarf cooling track when the last thermal pulse occurs .",
    "the envelope is then mixed downwards , and all remaining hydrogen is burnt , producing a few percent of nitrogen ( werner & herwig @xcite )",
    ". a corresponding abundance of nitrogen and the total absence of hydrogen on the stellar surface would therefore be indicative for the vltp scenario .",
    "wolf - rayet spectra form in expanding stellar atmospheres under extreme non - lte conditions .",
    "they often have complex ionization stratifications , and different spectral lines form in different spatial regions .",
    "the hydrostatic layers are often completely hidden under the optically thick wind .",
    "adequate model atmospheres are prerequisite to analyze wolf - rayet type spectra .    the potsdam wolf - rayet ( powr ) code ( e.g.  hamann & grfener @xcite ) solves the radiative transfer equation in the co - moving frame , consistently with the equations of statistical equilibrium .",
    "iron line blanketing is included in the superlevel approach .",
    "clumping is taken into account in the approximation of small - scale inhomogeneities , generally adopting a density contrast of @xmath0=10 ( hamann & koesterke @xcite ) .",
    ".analyses of early - type [ wc ] stars ; @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     ( 2 ) old classification",
    "distances of galactic pne are generally unknown , and hence the stellar parameters can not be determined on an absolute scale .",
    "we adopt a default luminosity of @xmath4 = 3.7 . fortunately expanding stellar atmosphere follow a kind of scale invariance .",
    "the important parameter is the `` transformed radius '' @xmath5 as a combination of mass - loss rate and stellar radius ( cf .",
    "e.g.  hamann & grfener @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar mass is only of marginal influence on the spectra and adopted to 0.6@xmath6 .",
    "hence the free parameters to be derived by the spectral analyses are the stellar temperature @xmath7 , the transformed radius @xmath5 , the terminal wind velocity @xmath8 , and , most interesting for our questions , the chemical composition .",
    "the results of our new analyses are compiled in table1 . in the following",
    "we briefly discuss the chemical abundances .",
    "_ carbon and helium .",
    "_ in our analyses we determine the he : c ratio mainly from the line pair heii5412 and civ5470 ( figs .  [",
    "fig : hec - sequence ] and [ fig : fit - hec ] ) . as [ wce ]",
    "have highly ionized atmospheres , we checked the possible impact of very high ions of carbon and oxygen which are usually neglected in the model codes .",
    "although the civ lines are fed mainly by recombination from cv , the inclusion of further levels above the cv singlet ground state did barely change the model spectra .",
    "our new [ wce ] analyses confirm in all cases he : c mass ratios of about 2:1 , in contrast to the higher carbon abundance ( he @xmath9 c ) found in [ wcl ] .",
    "spectrum of bd+30@xmath103639 ( thin line ) , compared to a model ( thick line ) with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14km / s.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    _ nitrogen .",
    "_ as pointed out by werner & herwig ( @xcite ) , only a vltp can efficiently produce nitrogen by h ingestion , leading to a n mass fraction of a few percent .",
    "hence the detection of nitrogen could discriminate between the scenarios .",
    "we found indications for such overabundance in most of our analyzed [ wce ] stars ( except hen2 - 55 and ngc6905 ) , but this preliminary result must still be further substantiated .    _ hydrogen . _ in principle h abundances could discriminate between the scenarios , but the h lines are always blended with heii and nebular emission .",
    "small amounts of hydrogen have been found in some [ wcl ] stars ( koesterke @xcite and references therein ) , while some pg1159 stars  presumably also evolutionary related to the [ wc]-type central stars  show even more hydrogen . in the hot [ wce ] stars , a possible spectral signature from hydrogen would be weak . for our [ wce ] program stars we can establish an upper limit of @xmath15% for the hydrogen mass fraction",
    ".    _ iron . _ a whole `` forest '' of iron lines is often visible in the uv spectra of [ wcl ] central stars ( see fig.[fig : bd30iueeisenproce ] ) . our sample of [ wce ] stars , however ,",
    "does not show detectable iron lines , neither in the observed spectra nor in the models .",
    "therefore we can not check the iron abundance for a possible depletion , as it was observed for one cooler [ wce ] star in the lmc , smp61 ( stasinska et al.@xcite ) .",
    "= 1.5% and observation ( thin line ) ]",
    "the comparison between spectral analyses and evolutionary predictions are still not conclusive .",
    "the low carbon abundance of [ wce ] stars is contrasting to the [ wcl ] stars , and pointing to an aftp origin .",
    "the small amount of h found in some [ wcl ] is explained from ltp models , while the possible n overabundance is rather predicted by a `` very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) '' ."
