    "the study of highly frustrated magnets began with wannier and houtappel s realization that the triangular lattice ising antiferromagnet is paramagnetic at any nonzero temperature and exhibits a macroscopic entropy even in at zero temperature.@xcite this canonical example illustrates the defining characteristics of such systems - their failure to order at temperatures of order the exchange constant , empirically derivable from the high temperature curie susceptibility , and a large low - temperature entropy.@xcite    the advent of the cuprate superconductors led to seriously renewed interest in these systems in the hope of finding a quantum spin liquid - the zero temperature state of a quantum magnet that fails to order .",
    "subsequently their study has blossomed , driven by an increasing list of materials that exhibit highly frustrated antiferromagnetism , and is driven as much in hopes of finding unusual ordering at low temperatures . an appealing , if optimistic , analogy is to the quantum hall system , where the magnetic field frustrates the kinetic energy and produces a macroscopic degeneracy , which is then lifted by residual terms in the hamiltonian to produce a rich phase diagram with various orderings .",
    "the most promising system in this regard is the nearest - neighbor heisenberg system on the `` pyrochlore '' lattice , a network of corner - sharing tetrahedara ( fig  [ fig : lattice ] ) .",
    "the idealized system has a vast ground state degeneracy in the classical limit of infinite spin and there is a large and growing list of materials that approximate this to varying degrees , including doped variants that superconduct or display behavior reminiscent of the heavy fermions .    in this paper we limit ourselves to the insulating magnets .",
    "here it is known@xcite that the classical system does _ not _ exhibit order by disorder and remains a ( co - operative ) paramagnet down to @xmath0 . on general grounds",
    "one expects that quantum fluctuations will select an ordering at sufficiently large spin in a spin - wave treatment about the classical ground states.@xcite at smaller values of spin , the situation is unsettled with some form of singlet order likely.@xcite    recently , building on work of yamashita and ueda,@xcite we have shown that in the presence of a coupling to the lattice , a different mechanism of degeneracy lifting is likely to operate.@xcite this involves a version of the jahn - teller effect in which the lattice distorts to gain exchange energy ( the `` spin - teller '' effect ) and thereby relieves the frustration .",
    "as magnetoelastic couplings are ubiquitous , and lead to a transition even at infinite spin , this mechanism will dominate over the purely quantum selection effect , likely starting at modest values of the spin.@xcite also noteworthy in this problem is the likelihood of a finite temperature bond ordered phase preceeding the eventual establishment of neel order .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed account of our anaysis of the jahn - teller effect for heisenberg magnets on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "parts of this work have already been summarised in a short paper.@xcite in section [ sec : jt ] we begin with the symmetry analysis of the jahn - teller distortion of a single tetrahedron in the classical limit and then extend it to @xmath1 phonons for the infinite lattice .",
    "having identified the order parameter for lattice distortions ( bond ordering ) in this fashion , in section [ sec : landau ] we construct a landau theory of the transition into the bond ordered state which we contrast with the landau theory of the spin - peierls transition in quasi - one dimensional systems .",
    "finally we turn to the establishment of nel order which we discuss with the insight gained from analyzing bond order ( section [ sec : neel ] ) .",
    "such ordering is most naturally collinear but symmetry permits coplanarity and in appendix [ sec : coplanar ] we describe an interaction that would bring it about .",
    "appendix [ sec : quantum ] gives the quantum theory of the jahn - teller effect in a single tetrahedron .",
    "the experimental situation with regard to structure is briefly discussed in our concluding remarks in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we will discuss the dynamical signatures of various phases in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the structural unit of the pyrochlore antiferromagnet is a tetrahedral `` molecule '' with four spins in the corners . its high symmetry and the degeneracy of the ground state are the two prerequisites for the jahn - teller effect : the tetrahedron is distorted in its ground state .",
    "the tendency of individual tetrahedra to deform induces a coherent distortion of the entire crystal .",
    "we will describe the jahn - teller effect for a single tetrahedron in detail to understand which aspects are relevant for the description of the spin - peierls effect on the entire lattice .",
    "the energy of four spins on a regular tetrahedron is @xmath2 in a ground state , the total spin is 0 . for quantum spins of length @xmath3",
    ", there are @xmath4 linearly independent ground states , which can be constructed as follows .",
    "the total spin of the pair @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be @xmath7 , and likewise for the other pair , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "an overall spin singlet can be formed by combining two singlets , two triplets , and so on , giving a total of @xmath4 physically different singlet states .",
    "the problem of quantum spins on an elastic tetrahedron can be solved straightforwardly and is treated in detail in appendix [ sec : quantum ] . as the degeneracy and hence the jahn - teller distortion survive at arbitrarily large values of spin , the outcome ( with the exception of the extreme quantum case @xmath10 )",
    "can be understood by looking at the simpler problem with classical spins .",
    "in essence _ this _ spin - peierls effect is _ classical _ , in contrast with the usual cases where it goes away in that limit .    for classical spins ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state becomes continuous .",
    "in addition to a trivial rigid rotation of all four spins , there are two parameters that can be used for characterization of a ground state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sphere ] ) : the angle @xmath12 between spins 1 and 2 and the angle @xmath13 between the planes 12 and 34 .",
    "these two parameters determine the _ bond variables _ in a ground state , @xmath14    at the heart of the effect lies the dependence of exchange interaction on the relative positions of spins . for example , if @xmath15 depends strictly on the distance between spins @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the contribution of this pair to exchange energy , @xmath18({\\bf s}_i \\cdot { \\bf s}_j),\\ ] ] generally has a term linear in the relative displacement @xmath19",
    ". therefore , spins @xmath16 and @xmath17 exert on each other a force @xmath20 , which is repulsive or attractive depending on the angle between the spins . in a generic ground state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sphere ] ) , angles between spins are unequal , so that disparate forces cause a deformation of the tetrahedron .",
    "more generally , exchange interaction may depend not only on the distances between spins , but also on the angles between the bonds .",
    "we therefore write the magnetic and elastic energies of the spins in the most general form : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the energy of a ground state , @xmath23 are cartesian coordinates of the spins and @xmath24 are the appropriate elastic constants . to reduce the number of independent coordinates and forces",
    ", it is convenient to classify them in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry group @xmath25 of the tetrahedron . using the appropriate linear combinations of coordinates @xmath26 and forces @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 labels irreducible representations , @xmath29 enumerates its components ) one obtains a simpler result : @xmath30.\\ ] ]    six vibrational modes may affect the exchange energy : a singlet @xmath31 , a doublet @xmath32 , and a triplet @xmath33 .",
    "the breathing mode @xmath31 uniformly rescales exchange interactions on all bonds and does not discriminate between different ground states ; therefore it can be left out of consideration .",
    "a component of the vector triplet @xmath33 stretches and contracts by the same amount two bonds opposite each other ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons ] ) . as can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ eq : opposites - equal ] ) , such bonds are equally satisfied ( or equally frustrated ) in any ground state . therefore stretching one and contracting the other to the same extent cancels the linear term in magnetic energy , making the triplet mode ineffectual in relieving frustration via the jahn - teller mechanism .",
    "only one irreducible representation causes the jahn - teller effect : the doublet @xmath32 whose components are tetragonal and orthorombic distortions of the tetrahedron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons ] ) .",
    "since no other representations will be dealt with , we will suppress the representation subscript @xmath34 in what follows .",
    "the six bond variables @xmath35 contain the same representations .",
    "the singlet @xmath31 is the symmetric sum , which is nothing but the energy of the undistorted ground state ( [ eq : h - tetrahedron ] ) , i.e. , a constant that does not favor any particular ground state .",
    "the triplet @xmath33 contains the differences of forces on _ opposite _ bonds , @xmath36 as already mentioned , these differences vanish in a ground state .",
    "the remaining forces form a doublet @xmath32 showing the disparities between adjacent bonds : @xmath37/\\sqrt{12 } , \\nonumber \\\\ f_2 & \\!=\\ ! &   ( { \\bf s}_1 - { \\bf s}_2 ) \\cdot ( { \\bf s}_3 - { \\bf s}_4)/2 .   \\label{eq : f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the component @xmath38 shows by how much the blue bonds are stronger than the rest ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f ] ) ; @xmath39 measures the difference between the red and green bonds .",
    "the domain of possible values of the vector @xmath40 is an equilateral triangle .",
    "its perimeter is made of coplanar ground states ; the three corners correspond to the three distinct collinear ground states ; they are marked by the color of frustrated bonds .",
    "the two components of @xmath41 , like the two angles in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphere ] , can be used to parametrize degenerate classical ground states of a tetrahedron ; in fact , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "after these simplifications , the energy of the system has the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 are amplitudes of the tetragonal and orthorombic distortions . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the magnetic and elastic constants appropriate for the @xmath32 representation .",
    "the energy is minimized when @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 one can view the @xmath50 term as a quartic spin interaction @xmath51 induced by `` integrating out '' the phonons.@xcite it evidently prefers collinear ground states with four maximally satisfied bonds and two maximally frustrated bonds .",
    "the resulting distortion of the tetrahedron is tetragonal .",
    "it flattens or elongates along one of its @xmath52 axes , depending on the sign of the derivative @xmath46 .",
    "modulo global rotations of the spins , there are three degenerate ground states , which we label with the colors red , blue and green according to which pair of opposite bonds is frustrated ( fig .  [",
    "fig : f ] ) .",
    "their opposites are cyan , magenta , and yellow states with four frustrated bonds .",
    "we have found that ground states can have these secondary colors in a model with more general spin interactions , e.g. , 4-spin cyclic exchanges .",
    "see appendix [ sec : coplanar ] for details .    a consideration of quantum spins in the appendix [ sec : quantum ] yields essentially the same result : the energy is minimized when two opposite bonds ( e.g. , 12 and 34 ) have the highest spins @xmath53 each .",
    "such states are the quantum analogue of parallel spins . in contrast to the spin - peierls effect on a heisenberg chain ,",
    "this one is a classical affair : instead of forming spin singlet on stronger bonds , heisenberg spins of a tetrahedron form the highest spin on two weak bonds .",
    "an attempt to extend this calculation to an infinite network of tetrahedra runs into a substantial problem : all possible phonon modes , the number of which is proportional to the number of tetrahedra , couple to bond variables , and any one of them may thus lead to a magnetoelastic distortion . in order to describe the basic physics of the jahn - teller effect on the full lattice , in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to the ( over)simplified version with only a few participating phonons . as a result of this crude approximation , `` integrating out ''",
    "the phonons produces an infinite - range interaction between vectors @xmath41 of different tetrahedra . in a realistic model including phonons of all wavelengths , such forces will have a finite radius .",
    "however , the structure of the ground state is often insensitive to such details .",
    "we specialize to the case of phonons with the wavevector @xmath55 . in effect",
    ", this restricts all tetrahedra of the same orientation to have the same distortion ( figs .",
    "[ fig : neel - g ] and [ fig : neel - u ] ) .",
    "the existence of two types of tetrahedra ( labeled in what follows a and b ) , which differ by orientation , is the only new degree of freedom .",
    "the symmetry group of the lattice ( with equivalent tetrahedra identified ) is extended from @xmath25 to @xmath56 by the operation of inversion on any site , which exchanges tetrahedra a and b. irreducible representations are those of @xmath25 labeled by an additional quantum number , parity under the inversion .",
    "the relevant phonons are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are , respectively , uniform or staggered distortions of the lattice .",
    "for example , the first component of @xmath57 stretches all tetrahedra along the @xmath59 direction ( resulting in a macroscopic distortion of the crystal ) , whereas the first component of @xmath58 stretches tetrahedra a and squeezes tetrahedra @xmath60 along the same axis ( leaving the crystal dimensions unaltered to leading order ) .",
    "the resulting distortions of tetrahedra a and b can be written @xmath61 the sum of elastic and magnetic energies , @xmath62 is readily minimized with respect to the phonon variables : @xmath63 the minimized energy thus consists of two terms .",
    "the first term is diagonal in @xmath64 and @xmath65 : @xmath66 it puts tetrahedra of both types into one of the three collinear states ( red , green , or blue ) , thus defining a 3-state potts model .",
    "the cross term , @xmath67 introduces a coupling between the potts states on the two sublattices .",
    "a softer even phonon ( @xmath68 ) yields the ground state of a ferromagnetic potts model : all tetrahedra have the same primary color .",
    "a softer odd phonon ( @xmath69 ) produces a ground state with two different primary colors on the two sublattices",

    "our simple model of classical spins on an elastic lattice of tetrahedra appears to be reasonably successful in explaining ground - state properties of some frustrated magnets .",

    ", we have a symmetric paramagnetic state with no spin or bond order and no lattice distortions .",
    "the ground state ( @xmath0 ) is a nel phase with a distorted lattice .",
    "the two phases are distinguished , for example , by spin averages @xmath72 and by the disparities in bond lengths . in general",
    ", there may ( and in certain cases will ) exist an intermediate spin - peierls phase .",
    "it is distinct from the nel phase by the absence of spin order ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "it is also different from the paramagnetic phase by the presence of lattice distortions and unequal spin correlations @xmath74 between various nearest neighbors , with a concomitant lowered symmetry . in such cases , we expect two phase transitions : first , a high - temperature spin - peierls transition , which partially relieves frustration of spins , then , at a lower temperature , a transition into a nel state .",
    "such a scenario is permitted by symmetry and the frustration makes it easier to generate fluctuations that destablize the nel state without destroying the bond order .    in this section",
    ", we will discuss the spin - peierls transition using landau theory . by analogy with spin chains",
    ", we will identify the relevant order parameter and discuss possible phase transitions in the framework of the landau theory .      to introduce method and notation , we start with a familiar example , namely the landau theory of the spin - peierls transition in antiferromagnetic chains coupled to three - dimensional phonons .",
    "the paramagnetic and dimerized phases can be distinguished using the order parameter @xmath75 it vanishes in the paramagnetic phase , since all bonds are equivalent .",
    "spontaneous dimerization increases the probability of finding a singlet on half of the bonds , which leads to a nonzero value of @xmath76 .",

    "the continuity of the transition depends crucially on the absence of a cubic term in the expansion ( [ eq : f - chain - series ] ) . with chains ,",

    "likewise , @xmath87 . since , however , free energy must be invariant under all symmetry transformations , an @xmath85 term is forbidden .",
    "in contrast , we will find that a cubic term is allowed in certain cases for the spin - peierls order parameter on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "in such cases , the spin - peierls transition is expected to be discontinuous .",
    "what order parameters would characterize a spin - peierls phase in a network of tetrahedra ?",
    "the smallest unit of the lattice , a tetrahedron , contains 6 bond variables , so that there are 6 averages @xmath88 and 5 differences between them , all of which could serve as order parameters . from the symmetry viewpoint",

    "( [ eq : t2 ] ) .",
    "in the paramagnetic phase , both the doublet and triplet order parameters must vanish ( all nearest - neighbor bonds have the same strength ) . in a spin - peierls phase , either the doublet , or the triplet ( or , potentially , both ) will have nonzero expectation values .",
    "energy considerations of section [ sec : jt ] suggest that the driving force of this transition is the doublet .",
    "the two - component order parameter @xmath41 can be the same for all tetrahedra , in which case only the rotational symmetry of the lattice will be broken .",
    "symmetry with respect to inversion on a site can also be violated if the order parameter @xmath41 is not the same on tetrahedra of different orientations .",
    "lastly , translational symmetry of the lattice can also be broken if @xmath41 varies among equivalent tetrahedra forming a commensurate wave .",
    "we restrict the analysis to situations when the translational symmetry of the lattice remains intact , as we did previously in section [ sec : jt - lattice ] . in this case",
    ", any two tetrahedra of the same orientation distort in the same way reducing the space group of the pyrochlore lattice to the octahedral point group @xmath91 ( inversion @xmath92 exchanges tetrahedra of different orientations ) . despite this rather drastic simplification",
    ", we will see that we can account for the experimentally observed behaviour of a number of compounds , at least qualitatively .",
    "phonons at other points in the brillouin zone may drive a spin - peierls transition as well , leading to ordered states with larger and often more complex unit cells .",
    "the order parameter has ( potentially unequal ) values @xmath64 and @xmath65 on tetrahedra of inequivalent orientations .",
    "their symmetric and antisymmetric combinations @xmath93 and @xmath94 are irreducible doublets of the group @xmath95 . in the paramagnetic phase , @xmath96 . in various spin - peierls phases , one or both of these order parameters are nonzero .    for classical spins , the domain of possible values of the order parameters",

    "landau theory is of course strictly to be applied only for small values of the order parameters .",
    "however , the shape of the range of the vector @xmath41  ( fig  [ fig : f ] ) encodes some information on where the order parameter , once close to saturation , may point .",
    "this form of the free energy permits a number of distinct ordered states .",
    "generally , the symmetry of the lattice is reduced from cubic to tetragonal .",
    "in addition , the presence of an odd distortion ( @xmath106 , or @xmath107 ) also breaks the symmetry of inversion through a site , exchanging tetrahedra @xmath108 and @xmath60 . note that , whenever a staggered distortion @xmath104 is present , the coupling term ( [ glc ] ) generates a subdominant uniform distortion @xmath103 of the crystal .",
    "the phase transitions can be first or second order , depending on the mode driving the transition : the free energy of the even mode @xmath109 may have a cubic term ( [ gla ] ) , which generally leads to a discontinuous jump .",

    "changing the sign of the order parameter @xmath103 would give a state with 2 strong and 4 weak bonds on every tetrahedron ( secondary color ) , which need not have the same free energy , @xmath110 .",
    "hence a @xmath111 term is allowed . on the other hand , in a state with a pure odd distortion ,",

    "because the high - temperature transitions in cases ( c ) and ( d ) are discontinuous , the intermediate phase ( single primary or secondary color ) may be skipped completely . in that case , instead of a succession of two transitions , there will be a single , discontinuous transition directly into the final state with two different colors , @xmath107 .",

    "their monte carlo simulations suggest that the 3-state potts antiferromagnet on the diamond lattice orders into the pss phase.@xcite in both cases , the phase transition appears to be continuous , with critical properties of the xy model in @xmath146 .",
    "the spin - peierls transition , whether in chains or in three - dimensional magnets , is driven by the desire of spins to reduce frustration . in the bond - ordered phase ,",
    "exchange strength varies from bond to bond because of the distortion .",
    "thus frustration is relieved and the classical ground state becomes unique , modulo global spin rotations . in three dimensions , we can expect a spin - ordered state at zero temperature . as argued before",
    ", the transition into a nel state need not coincide with the spin - peierls transition .",
    "therefore , generally there will be three separate phases : paramagnetic , spin - peierls , and nel .",
    "( in those cases when the spin - peierls transition is discontinuous , the system may go directly into the nel phase bypassing the spin - peierls stage . )",
    "particulars of the nel order on a distorted lattice obviously depends on the details of the distortion , which strengthens some bonds and weakens others . because precise knowledge of spin interactions is rarely available ( even for the undistorted state ! ) , one can try an alternative route , namely to include spin averages @xmath147 in the landau theory developed above for a spin - peierls phase .    to keep technical details to a minimum",
    ", we will restrict the discussion to nel states that do not break translational symmetry of the crystal , i.e. , spin averages @xmath147 will be assumed to be identical for all tetrahedra of the same orientation . put another way ,",
    "@xmath147 is the average spin on the @xmath16-th sublattice , @xmath148 .",
    "evidently , this parametrization adequately describes only a fraction of possible antiferormagnetic orders .",
    "for example , one of the nel ground states obtained in our simple magnetoelastic model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neel - u ] ) is already beyond its scope .",
    "more generally , even @xmath149  bond ordered states with different strengths on the pair of bonds of inequivalent tetrahedra related by inversion can not be translated into a @xmath149  spin state .",
    "let us construct the landau free energy for spins on an undistorted lattice . using the order parameters @xmath150 one obtains the following expansion for the free energy : @xmath151 in an antiferromagnet , @xmath152 ; for stability , we take @xmath153 . when @xmath154 becomes negative ,",
    "the minimum of the free energy shifts away from @xmath155 and the system will enter a nel state .",
    "the free energy is minimized by _ any _ configuration of spin averages satisfying @xmath156 ; the length of the averages is given by @xmath157 .",
    "the nel pattern is thus not unique , as expected for a frustrated magnet .",
    "in addition to the quartic term shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f - neel ] ) , the free energy expansion may contain one more quartic invariant , @xmath158 this term , in fact , will break the degeneracy of the nel states . in the case",
    "@xmath159 , the nel phase has collinear spins ( any one of the three collinear states in fig .",
    "[ fig : f ] . note that these states also break the bond symmetry . )",
    "when @xmath160 , the spin averages point at equal angles of @xmath161 to one another .",
    "a lattice distortion , however small , breaks the cubic symmetry , so that additional , less symmetric terms will appear in the free energy . for a distortion that , symmetry - wise , belongs to the irreducible doublet @xmath32 , the lowest - order perturbation will be of the form @xmath162 where @xmath41 is the familiar spin - peierls order parameter describing the distortion . the spin part @xmath163 should therefore also be a doublet of the same symmetry : @xmath164/\\sqrt{12 } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\phi_2 & = &   ( { \\bf s}_1 - { \\bf s}_2 ) \\cdot ( { \\bf s}_3 - { \\bf s}_4)/2",

    "the free energy then takes the following form : @xmath167 the last term is simply eq .",
    "( [ eq : biquad ] ) ; we have also dropped the term @xmath168 assuming that the minimization is done over antiferromagnetic states .",
    "minimization can now be done separately over the length @xmath169 and direction variables @xmath170 .",

    "[ fig : f ] .",
    "the outcome is decided by a competition between the biquadratic exchange ( [ eq : biquad ] ) and the coupling to the spin - peierls order ( [ eq : spin - bond ] ) .",
    "generally , a distortion @xmath41 pulls the vector @xmath170 in the same direction ( if @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) , whereas the biquadratic coupling attempts to minimize ( @xmath160 ) or maximize ( @xmath159 ) its length .",
    "[ fig : neel - gl ] shows the appropriate phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic ordering for the case of a uniform tetragonal distortion .",
    "when the influence of the distortion dominates , we find two nel phases . for a distortion that produces four strong bonds per tetrahedron , the spins are collinear ( e.g. , @xmath174 ) ; a distortion of the opposite sense ( four weak bonds ) stabilizes a coplanar state with two _ orthogonal _ pairs of spins ( e.g. , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , while @xmath177 , fig .",

    "in this paper , we have presented a theory of the spin - peierls transition in a frustrated magnetic system , the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the `` pyrochlore '' lattice .",
    "several aspects distinguish this effect from its counterpart in spin chains ( e.g. , cugeo@xmath180 ) .",
    "( 1 ) the magnetic system is manifestly three - dimensional , initially possessing a cubic symmetry . ( 2 ) the effect is classical : the quantum mechanics of spins plays no significant role .",
    "( 3 ) the order parameter ( disparity of spin correlations ) has rather nontrivial symmetry properties : its components form an irreducible doublet of the tetrahedral symmetry group .    what drives this spin - peierls transition ?",
    "from the kinematical viewpoint , the color variables ( [ eq : f ] ) can be viewed as coordinates in the manifold of ground states .",
    "the onset of a bond order thus lifts the large accidental degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "the dynamical reason for the transition is the jahn - teller effect occuring in the building blocks of the `` pyrochlore '' lattice , tetrahedra of magnetic ions . unlike in many cubic spinels , where the jahn - teller distortion is caused by an _",
    "degeneracy , here it is driven by the _ spin _",
    "degrees of freedom . an isolated tetrahedron ( whether with quantum or classical spins ) undergoes a tetragonal distortion along one of the three orthogonal symmetry axes , producing four strong and two weak bonds  or vice versa , depending on the sense of the distortion .",
    "( the residual threefold degeneracy of the spin - and - phonon ground state relates this problem to the 3-state potts model . )",
    "a study of the spin - driven distortion of an isolated tetrahedron provides clues to the simplest description of the spin - peierls effect on the lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra , in particular the form of the order parameter . depending on the parity of the phonon responsible for the transition ,",
    "landau theory predicts a first or second - order spin - peierls transition .",
    "it is gratifying to see that these predictions are consistent with known properties of the 3-state potts model on the diamond lattice , onto which our problem can be mapped .",
    "although a distortion of the lattice reduces the geometric frustration , there is no reason to expect that it induces a nel order immediately at @xmath83 . with the exception of strongly discontinuous spin - peierls transitions ,",
    "spin order will will generally set in at a lower temperature than bond order .",
    "a transition between a spin - peierls and nel phases has been analyzed above , again in the framework of landau theory , which predicts collinear , coplanar , and more general antiferromagnetic orders at the lowest temperatures .",
    "are there experimental realizations of the bond - ordering transition described in this work ?",
    "the spinel compound zncr@xmath70o@xmath71 , in which cr@xmath181 ions ( @xmath182 ) form the tetrahedral network , appears to be a good candidate for a heisenberg antiferromagnet on the `` pyrochlore '' lattice . indeed",
    ", it exhibits a magnetic transition at @xmath183 k accompanied by a structural distortion.@xcite nel order is observed at @xmath184 , which is not surprising given that the transition is discontinuous .",
    "another spinel , mgv@xmath70o@xmath71 , shows a sequence of two transitions:@xcite a structural one occurs at @xmath185 k , nel order appears at @xmath186 k. however , because of an orbital degeneracy ( the outer electrons in v@xmath181 are @xmath187 ) , the upper transition may well be triggered by the ordinary jahn - teller effect common to spinels .",
    "therefore , we can not positively identify it as a spin - peierls transition .",
    "nevertheless , the nel order in this compound ( and also in ymn@xmath70 ) agrees with the prediction of a simple magnetoelastic model given here ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neel - u ] ) .",
    "lastly , a recently discovered second - order structural phase transition@xcite in the metallic pyrochlore cd@xmath70re@xmath70o@xmath188 at @xmath189 k may turn out to be a closely related peierls transition , whose symmetry properties are identical .",
    "we have presented a bare - bones theoretical description of the spin - peierls transition in a `` pyrochlore '' antiferromagnet .",
    "only the simplest ordering patterns have been discussed , namely those that do not break the translational symmetry of the crystal .",
    "an obvious extension of this work would be to include bond and spin orders at nonzero commensurate wave vectors .",
    "e.g. , a phonon with @xmath190 appears to be responsible for the distortion in zncr@xmath70o@xmath71 .",

    "dmr-9978074 and by the david and lucille packard foundation .",
    "in addition to pairwise spin exchange , which gives rise to the heisenberg interaction @xmath191 , spins can be involved in longer exchange cycles , such as @xmath192 and 312 .",
    "the cyclic exchange of 3 spins induces the same pairwise heisenberg interaction , which has already been considered .",
    "the next nontrivial contribution comes from 4-spin cyclic exchange @xmath193 which  for @xmath10  moves spin states clockwise or counterclockwise around the loop 1234 ( fig .",

    "this interaction is weaker than pairwise exchange and can be considered as a perturbation .",

    "the sum @xmath197 , being invariant under all symmetry operations , can enter an expression for the energy on its own . in the subspace of the ground states of the heisenberg hamiltonian",
    ", this perturbation can be written as a biquadratic term @xmath198 the outcome depends on the sign of the coupling constant @xmath199 .",

    "the two differences between @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 form an irreducible doublet @xmath32 .",
    "they can therefore couple to the phonon doublet of the same symmetry adding this magnetoelastic term to the energy : @xmath200 where @xmath201 describes variation of the cyclic exchanges under a tetragonal or orthorombic distortion . after adding an elastic term @xmath202 and minimizing with respect to the phonon variables @xmath203 , one obtains the following contribution to the energy : @xmath204 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ ( { \\bf s}_2 \\!\\cdot\\ ! { \\bf s}_3)^2   - ( { \\bf s}_3 \\!\\cdot\\ ! { \\bf s}_1)^2 \\right]^2 \\\\ & + & \\left [ ( { \\bf s}_3 \\!\\cdot\\ ! { \\bf s}_1)^2   - ( { \\bf s}_1 \\!\\cdot\\ ! { \\bf s}_2)^2 \\right]^2 \\big\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the energy is lowered by the greatest amount in coplanar states with spins making angles of @xmath205 and @xmath206 with one another .",
    "these states have two pairs of frustrated bonds and are marked in secondary colors in fig .",
    "[ fig : f ] : e.g. a state with blue and red frustrated bonds is magenta .",
    "as the two physical forces described above  the four - spin exchange and its coupling to the phonons  favor different ground states , the outcome is decided by their relative strengths .",
    "in particular , the ground state has orthogonal spins [ fig .",
    "[ fig : cyclic](d ) ] when the 4-spin exchange is very sensitive to atomic displacements ( and therefore the distortion is large ) .",
    "the reason for this effect can be understood as follows .",
    "a strong tetragonal distortion enhances the 4-spin exchange around one loop and suppresses the same around the remaining two .",
    "when the latter are completely switched off , we are dealing with a square , and for a square the 4-spin cyclic exchange produces a ground state with orthogonal spins.@xcite",
    "quantum spins coupled to classical distortions of the tetrahedron have the following hamiltonian in the subspace of ground states : @xmath207 which is formally the same as the classical energy ( [ eq : e - x - f ] ) . for a fixed `` direction '' of the distortion",
