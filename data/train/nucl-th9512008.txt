    "one of the most exciting challenges in today s nuclear structure is the physics of exotic nuclei far from the line of @xmath0-stability .",
    "what makes this subject particularly interesting ( and difficult ) is the unique combination of weak binding and the proximity of the particle continuum , both implying the large diffuseness of the nuclear surface and extreme spatial dimensions characterizing the outermost nucleons @xcite .    for the weakly bound nuclei the decay channels have to be considered explicitly .",
    "due to the virtual scattering of nucleons from bound orbitals to unbound scattering states , the traditional shell - model technology becomes inappropriate .",
    "the proper tool is the continuum shell model @xcite which correctly accounts for the coupling to resonances ; the single - particle basis of the continuum shell model consists of both bound and unbound states .",
    "the explicit coupling between bound states and the continuum and the presence of low - lying low-@xmath1 scattering states invites strong interplay between various aspects of nuclear structure and reaction theory .    particularly exciting are new phenomena on the neutron - rich side . because neutrons do not carry an electric charge ,",
    "the neutron drip line is located very far from the valley of @xmath0-stability .",
    "consequently , the neutron drip - line systems ( i.e. , those close to the neutron drip line ) are characterized by unusually large @xmath2/@xmath3 ratios . the outer zone of these nuclei are expected to constitute essentially a new form of a many - body system : low - density neutron matter ( neutron halos and skins ) .",
    "except for the lightest nuclei , the bounds of neutron stability are not known experimentally . theoretically , because of their sensitivity to various theoretical details ( e.g. , approximations used , parameter values , interactions ) predicted drip lines are strongly model - dependent .",
    "the placement of the one - neutron drip line , defined by the condition @xmath4 , is solely determined by the binding energy difference between two neighboring isotopes .",
    "analogously , the vanishing two - neutron separation energy , @xmath5 , defines the position of the two - neutron drip line . since experimental masses ( binding energies ) near the neutron drip lines are unknown , in order to extrapolate far from stability , the large - scale mass calculations are usually used ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , since their techniques and parameters are optimized to reproduce known atomic masses , it is by no means obvious whether the particle number dependence obtained from global calculations at extreme values of @xmath6 is correct .",
    "apart from strong theoretical and experimental interest in nuclear physics aspects of exotic nuclei , calculations for nuclei far from stability have strong astrophysical implications , especially in the context of the r - process mechanism @xcite .    in previous work",
    "@xcite several aspects of nuclear structure at the limits of extreme isospin were discussed by means of the macroscopic - microscopic approach . in the present study , ground - state properties of drip - line systems and the sensitivity of predictions to effective forces",
    "are investigated by means of the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ forces ] discusses the effective interactions employed in this study . since pairing correlations are crucial for the behavior of drip - line systems ,",
    "particular attention is paid to the particle - particle ( p - p , pairing ) component of the interaction . after a short review of general properties of effective pairing interactions , with emphasis on the density dependence , the pairing forces investigated in our work , namely contact forces ( delta interaction , density - dependent delta interaction , and skyrme interaction ) and the finite - range gogny force ,",
    "are described .",
    "the basic ingredients of the hfb formalism in the coordinate representation ( single - quasiparticle orbitals , time - reversal symmetry , canonical states , and various densities ) are defined in sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] .",
    "in contrast to the single - quasiparticle wave functions which often contain a scattering ( outgoing ) component , canonical states ( sec .",
    "[ sec2ab ] ) are always localized , even if they have positive average energy .",
    "the interpretation of particle and ( especially ) pair densities in terms of single - particle and correlation probabilities is given in sec .",
    "[ sec2ac ] .",
    "this interpretation is essential when relating the calculated hfb densities and fields to various experimental observables .",
    "the structure of the hfb equations is analyzed in sec .",

    ", various functions entering the equations of motion ( i.e. , mass parameters and mean field potentials ) are introduced for both p - h and p - p channels ( secs .",
    "[ sec2ba ] and [ sec2bap ] ) .",
    "the advantage of using the coordinate - space hfb formalism for weakly bound systems is that in this method the particle continuum is treated properly .",
    "this important point is discussed in detail in sec .",
    "in particular , the difference between the single - particle hartree - fock ( hf ) spectra and canonical hfb spectra ( sec .",
    "[ sec3d ] ) , the asymptotic properties of the hfb states ( sec .  [ sec2bcd ] ) and densities ( sec .  [ sec3c ] ) , and the effect of the pairing coupling to positive - energy states ( sec .  [ sec3e ] ) are carefully explained .",
    "the robust predictions of the formalism for various experimental observables ( pairing gaps and pair transfer amplitudes , masses and separation energies , radii , shell gaps , and shell structure ) are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , where experimental fingerprints of the surface - peaked pairing fields and the quenching of shell effects far from stability are also given .",
    "section  [ sec6 ] contains the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "the technical details ( i.e. , the form of a mean - field gogny hamiltonian and the discussion of the energy cut - off in the skyrme model ) are collected in the appendices .",
    "the uniqueness of drip - line nuclei for studies of effective interactions is due to the very special role played by the pairing force .",
    "this is seen from approximate hfb relations between the fermi level , @xmath7 , pairing gap , @xmath8 , and the particle separation energy , @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 since for drip - line nuclei @xmath9 is very small , @xmath11@xmath120 . consequently , the single - particle field characterized by @xmath7 ( determined by the p - h component of the effective interaction ) and the pairing field @xmath8 ( determined by the p - p part of the effective interaction ) are equally important . in other words ,",
    "contrary to the situation encountered close to the line of beta stability , the pairing component can no longer be treated as a _",
    "residual _ interaction ; i.e. , a small perturbation important only in the neighborhood of the fermi surface .",
    "surprisingly , rather little is known about the basic properties of the p - p force . in most calculations ,",
    "the pairing hamiltonian has been approximated by the state - independent seniority pairing force , or schematic multipole pairing interaction @xcite .",
    "such oversimplified forces , usually treated by means of the bcs approximation , perform remarkably well when applied to nuclei in the neighborhood of the stability valley ( where , as pointed out above , pairing can be considered as a small correction ) . as a result ,",
    "considerable effort was devoted in the past to optimizing the p - h part of the interaction , while leaving the p - p component aside .",
    "up to now , the microscopic theory of the pairing interaction has only seldom been applied in realistic calculations for finite nuclei ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent example ) .",
    "a  first - principle \" derivation of pairing interaction from the bare @xmath13 force using the renormalization procedure ( @xmath14-matrix technique ) , still encounters many problems such as , e.g. , treatment of core polarization @xcite .",
    "hence , phenomenological pairing interactions are usually introduced .",
    "two important open questions asked in this context are : ( i ) the role of finite range , and ( ii ) the importance of density dependence .",
    "since the realistic effective interactions are believed to have a finite range , the first question seems purely academic .",
    "however , the remarkable success of zero - range skyrme forces suggests that , in many cases , the finite - range effect can be mocked up by an explicit velocity dependence . to",
    "what extent this is true for the pairing channel remains to be seen",
    ". one obvious advantage of using finite - range forces is the automatic cut - off of high - momentum components ; for the zero - range forces this is solved by restricting the pair scattering to a limited energy range and by an appropriate renormalization of the pairing coupling constant ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) .",
    "the answer to the question on the density dependence is much less clear .",
    "early calculations @xcite for nuclear matter predicted a very weak @xmath15 pairing at the saturation point ( @xmath16=1.35@xmath17 ) .",
    "consequently , it was concluded that strong pairing correlations in finite nuclei had to be due to interactions at the nuclear surface .",
    "this led to the surface delta interaction ( sdi ) @xcite , a highly successful residual interaction between valence nucleons .",
    "of course , the sdi is an extreme example of surface interaction .",
    "more realistic density - dependent pairing forces are variants of the density - dependent delta interaction ( dddi ) introduced in the migdal theory of finite fermi systems @xcite .    since the effective interactions commonly used in the hf calculations are bound to be density dependent in order to reproduce the compressibility of the infinite nuclear matter @xcite ( an explicit density dependence",
    "is also said to account for three- and higher - body components of the interaction ) , it seems natural to introduce the density dependence in the p - p channel as well @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the presence ( absence ) of the density dependence in the pairing channel has consequences for the spatial properties of pairing densities and fields .",
    "as early recognized @xcite , the density - independent p - p force gives rise to a pairing field that has a volume character .",
    "for instance , the commonly used contact delta interaction , @xmath18 leads to volume pairing . by adding a density - dependent component ,",
    "the pairing field becomes surface - peaked .",
    "a simple modification of force ( [ didi ] ) is the dddi @xcite @xmath19^\\gamma\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the isoscalar nucleonic density , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants . if @xmath23 is chosen such that it is close to the saturation density , @xmath23@xmath12@xmath24 , both the resulting pair density and the pairing potential @xmath25 ( see secs .",
    "[ sec2ac ] and [ sec2ba ] ) are small in the nuclear interior . by varying the magnitude of the density - dependent term",
    ", the transition from volume pairing [ @xmath23@xmath26@xmath27 to surface pairing can be probed .",
    "what are the experimental arguments in favor of surface pairing ?",
    "probably the strongest evidence is the odd - even staggering in differential radii , explained in terms of the direct coupling between the proton density and the neutron pairing tensor @xcite .",
    "other experimental observables which strongly reflect the spatial character of pairing are the particle widths and energies of deep - hole states @xcite , strongly influenced by the pairing - induced coupling to the particle continuum , and the pair transfer form factors , directly reflecting the shape of the pair density . because of strong surface effects , the properties of weakly bound nuclei are sensitive to the density dependence of pairing . in particular , the same type of force is used to describe the spatial extension of loosely bound light systems @xcite .",
    "( the measurable fingerprints of surface pairing in neutron - rich systems are further discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . ) in this context , it is also worth mentioning that the self - consistent model with the dddi has recently been used to describe the nuclear charge radii @xcite and the moments of inertia of superdeformed nuclei @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the inclusion of a density dependence in the p - p channel turned out to be crucial for the reproduction of experimental data around @xmath28hg .    in a series of papers @xcite the quasiparticle lagrangian method ( qlm )",
    "@xcite based on the single - particle green function approach in the coordinate representation @xcite has been applied to the description of nuclear superfluidity .",
    "the resulting pairing interaction , based on the landau - migdal ansatz @xcite , has zero - range and contains two - body and three - body components , thus leading to a density - dependent contact force similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ dddi ] ) .",
    "( note that in the approximations of ref .",
    "@xcite , the _ neutron _ pairing interaction is proportional to the _ proton _ density and vice versa . ) however , in practical qlm calculations @xcite , a pure density - independent delta force was used .",
    "a better understanding of the density dependence of the nuclear pairing interaction is important for theories of superfluidity in neutron stars . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is impossible at present to deduce the magnitude of the pairing gaps in neutron stars with sufficient accuracy .",
    "indeed , calculations of @xmath15 pairing gaps in pure neutron matter , or symmetric nuclear matter , based on bare @xmath13 interactions @xcite suggest a strong dependence on the force used ; in general , the singlet-@xmath9 pairing is very small at the saturation point .",
    "on the other hand , nuclear matter calculations with an effective finite - range interaction , namely the gogny force @xcite , yield rather large values of the pairing gap at saturation ( @xmath8@xmath290.7mev ) .",

    "spin - orbit and density - dependent terms of zero range are also included as in the skyrme parametrizations .",
    "the pairing field is calculated from the d1s force , i.e. , the same interaction is used for a microscopic description for both the mean field and the pairing channels .",
    "however , by a specific choice of the exchange contribution , the pairing component of the d1s is density - independent .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the pairing component of the d1s is repulsive at short distances and attractive at long ranges @xcite . for the d1s force ,",
    "the effective mass for infinite nuclear matter is @xmath33=0.70 .",
    "the parameters of the d1s interaction were chosen to reproduce certain global properties of a set of spherical nuclei and of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the hfb+gogny results presented here were obtained by expanding the hfb wave functions in a harmonic oscillator basis containing up to 19 shells .",
    "the hfb approach is a variational method which uses independent - quasiparticle states as trial wave functions .",
    "these states are particularly convenient when used in a variational theory , because , due to the wick theorem @xcite , one can easily calculate for them the average values of an arbitrary many - body hamiltonian .",
    "even if the exact eigenstates of such a hamiltonian can be rather remote from any one of the independent - quasiparticle states , one can argue @xcite that one may obtain in this way fair estimates of at least one - body observables .",
    "an independent - quasiparticle state is defined as a vacuum of quasiparticle operators which are linear combinations of particle creation and annihilation operators .",
    "this linear combination is called the bogoliubov transformation @xcite . according to the thouless theorem @xcite ,",
    "every independent - quasiparticle state @xmath34 , which is not orthogonal to the vacuum state @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36@xmath370 , can be presented in the form @xmath38 where the thouless matrix @xmath3 is antisymmetric , @xmath39 , and in general complex .",
    "the phase of state ( [ eq101 ] ) is fixed by the condition @xmath36=1 ; the norm is given by @xmath40=@xmath41 . in the following",
    ", state @xmath34 will represent the @xmath42=0@xmath43 ground state of the even - even system .",
    "we refer to standard textbooks @xcite for a discussion of the properties of the bogoliubov transformation . here",
    "we start our discussion from the trial wave function ( [ eq101 ] ) which is parametrized by the matrix elements of @xmath3 .",
    "this form of the independent - quasiparticle state is very convenient in variational applications because variations with respect to all matrix elements @xmath44=@xmath45 are independent of one another .    instead of using the matrix representation corresponding to a set of single - particle creation operators",
    "@xmath46 numbered by the discrete index @xmath47 , one may use the spatial coordinate representation .",
    "this is particularly useful when discussing spatial properties of the variational wave functions and the coupling to the particle continuum .",
    "therefore , in the following , we shall consider the operators creating a particle in the space point @xmath48 and having the projection of spin @xmath49=@xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the wave function of the @xmath47-th single - particle state . to simplify the following expressions , we consider only one type of particle .",
    "a generalization to systems described by a product of neutron and proton wave functions is straightforward , while that involving the mixing in the isospin degree of freedom is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the inverse relation with respect to ( [ eq103 ] ) is given by @xmath53 equations ( [ eq103 ] ) and ( [ eq104 ] ) assume that the wave functions @xmath52 form an orthonormal and complete set . in practical calculations ,",
    "the basis has to be truncated and the completeness is realized only approximately .",
    "the choice of the single - particle wave functions used ( size of the set and , in particular , the asymptotic behavior ) is of crucial importance to the phenomena discussed in this study .    in coordinate space , the thouless state ( [ eq101 ] )",
    "has the form @xmath54 and is defined by the antisymmetric complex function , @xmath55= @xmath56 , of space - spin coordinates .",
    "already , at this point , we see that any variational method employing an attractive effective interaction for a _ bound finite system _ must lead to functions which are localized in space , @xmath57 recall that in the coordinate space , values of the function @xmath58 at different space - spin points are the variational parameters , and that any arbitrarily small value of this function at large distance , @xmath59 , would create at this point a non - zero probability density .",
    "whether this would be energetically favorable depends upon the number of particles in the system and on the interaction used in the variational method .",
    "apart from exotic phenomena such as halos , and apart from infinite matter such as in the neutron - star crust , we assume that the attractiveness of the interaction always favors compact , localized probability densities , and hence we require the localization condition ( [ eq106 ] ) for the variational parameters @xmath58 .",
    "an expansion of the variational function @xmath58 in terms of the single - particle wave functions is a straightforward consequence of transformations ( [ eq103 ] ) and ( [ eq104 ] ) , @xmath60 the localization condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq106 ] ) , can , therefore , be guaranteed in the most economic way by requiring that _ all _ single - particle wave functions @xmath52 vanish at large distances .",
    "of course , this is only a matter of convenience and manageability , because any localized function can be expanded in any complete basis .",
    "it is , however , obvious that such an expansion converges very slowly if the basis has inappropriate asymptotic properties .",
    "for example , one can expect that a plane - wave expansion of @xmath58 would require an infinite number of basis states @xmath52 , and in practice , any reduction to a finite basis would lead to serious errors . a discussion pertaining to asymptotic properties of functions in spatial coordinates , and the choice of an appropriate single - particle basis , will be a pivotal point in our study .",
    "the present study is entirely restricted to an analysis of ground - state phenomena , and therefore , we use only time - even variational independent - quasiparticle wave functions . the time - reversal operator can be represented as a product of the spin - flip operator and the complex conjugation ; i.e. , @xmath61=@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the explicit time - reversed creation operators then have the form    @xmath63 a^+_{\\bbox{r}\\sigma}.                                  \\label{eq108b }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now suppose that the set of basis states represented by the creation operators @xmath46 is closed with respect to time reversal , and that the state @xmath64 is actually proportional ( up to a phase factor @xmath65=@xmath66 , @xmath67=1 ) to another basis state denoted by a bar over the greek symbol , i.e. ,    @xmath68    in this way , the single - particle basis is assumed to be composed of pairs of time - reversed states denoted by indices @xmath47 and @xmath69 . in what follows ,",
    "we use the convention that @xmath70@xmath71@xmath47 , and that the sums over either @xmath47 or @xmath69 are always performed over _ all _ basis states .",
    "the phase factors @xmath72 depend on relative phases chosen for the @xmath47-th and @xmath69-th states of the basis ; it is convenient to keep them unspecified in all theoretical formulae and to make a definite suitable choice of the phase convention only in a specific final application .",
    "a requirement of the time - reversal symmetry of the quasiparticle vacuum ( [ eq101 ] ) or ( [ eq105 ] ) , @xmath73=@xmath34 , leads to the following conditions :    @xmath74    these properties allow the introduction of more suitable forms of @xmath44 and @xmath58 ; namely ,    @xmath75    the matrix @xmath76 and the function @xmath77 are both time - even and hermitian ,    @xmath78    and therefore they can be considered as usual operators in the corresponding hilbert spaces . in particular , the function @xmath79 can be diagonalized by solving the following integral eigenequation : @xmath80 where @xmath81 are real eigenvalues , @xmath81=@xmath82 .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath83 form the single - particle basis , usually referred to as the _ canonical basis_. canonical states , together with the eigenvalues @xmath81 , completely define the quasiparticle vacuum @xmath34 .",
    "( here and in the following we use the checked symbols , e.g. , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , to denote objects pertaining to the canonical basis . )",
    "two important remarks concerning the canonical basis are now in order .",
    "first , the localization condition ( [ eq106 ] ) directly results in the fact that _ all _ canonical - basis single - particle wave functions @xmath83 are localized in space ; i.e. , vanish at large distances , @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , as discussed previously , a choice of the localized wave functions for the basis states @xmath86 may allow for a rapid convergence in the expansion    @xmath87    second , since @xmath88 and @xmath76 are related by [ cf .",
