    "the coupling of atoms to light has been exploited since the early days of atomic physics to gain an insight into the structure of atoms and molecules .",
    "recently , there has been a great deal of interest in the quantum interface between light and an atomic ensemble @xcite and in using the coherent coupling between these two systems for quantum information processing , quantum information storage or the creation of deterministic photon sources @xcite .",
    "such photon sources rely on the ability to create certain entangled quantum states in atomic ensembles which are then subsequently converted into excitations of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "ultra cold atoms provide a toolbox for the creation of such atomic states .",
    "the reason is rooted in the versatility of these systems , such as the tunability of their interactions and the advanced techniques that have been developed for their trapping and manipulation @xcite . in particular , the exaggerated properties of highly excited ( rydberg ) atoms @xcite can be exploited in order to create entangled many - particle states . in a recent work @xcite this was shown for a system in which the atoms are confined to a deep ring lattice . here",
    "the collective excitations of the atomic ensemble were calculated analytically and it was shown that - due to the special geometry of the ring - these excitations possess a particularly symmetric structure .    in this paper",
    "we show how these symmetric states can be used to devise single and two photon sources .",
    "the properties of the photonic states are imposed mainly by the interplay between the particular shape of the system and the collectivity in the photon emission .",
    "we provide a - to a large extent - analytic description of the photonic states and a thorough discussion of their properties , such as their angular emission characteristics as well as their spatial correlations .",
    "we find that the ring geometry permits the preparation of photons in a superposition state of two tunable emission directions .",
    "furthermore , the system allows to create single photons with well - defined angular momentum and entangled photon pairs .",

    "our setup consists of @xmath5 identical atoms that are spatially localized at the positions @xmath9 .",
    "internally , we consider three levels which form a so - called @xmath3-system depicted in the lower half of fig . [",
    "fig : lambda]a ( note that , for the moment , we will not be concerned with the state @xmath4 ) .",
    "the three levels involved are the two hyperfine ground states @xmath0 and @xmath1 as well as a third level @xmath2 which will be used as an intermediate state .",
    "the left leg of the @xmath3-system is formed by a ( classical ) driving laser field with rabi frequency @xmath10 and momentum @xmath11 coupling @xmath1 off - resonantly to @xmath2 with a detuning @xmath12 .",
    "the right leg is formed by the electromagnetic ( quantum ) field into which eventually single photons are emitted due to the decay from @xmath2 to @xmath0 . in our scheme",
    "we do not consider decay from @xmath2 back to @xmath1 , which can be ensured by an appropriate choice of the atomic levels .",

    "the whole problem reduces then to an ensemble of two level systems which are coupled to a multi - mode light field with hamiltonian ( in the rotating - wave approximation ) @xmath19 the first and second terms of ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) represent the atomic energy ( @xmath20 ) and the energy of the electromagnetic field , respectively . here",
    "the operators @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) annihilate ( create ) photons with energy @xmath23 and unit polarization vector @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the atom - field interaction is described in the third term of the hamiltonian with the coupling coefficients being defined as @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the quantization volume , @xmath28 the vacuum permitivity , and @xmath29 the dipole matrix element of the @xmath30 transition .    upon switching on the classical field with rabi frequency @xmath10 the time - evolution under the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) will convert the atomic state ( [ eqn : initial_atomic ] ) into a photonic state . for times much longer than the lifetime of the intermediate state @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is its corresponding decay rate to @xmath0 , this can be formulated as a direct mapping between atomic and photonic states @xcite .",
    "this mapping is expressed by the unitary transformation @xmath33 with the time - evolution operator @xmath34 .",

    "some features of the photon emission can be already inferred from the eigenvalues of @xmath42 .",
    "its largest eigenvalue @xmath49 defines the degree of collectivity in the photon emission which in general depends on the interplay between two parameters : the average interparticle distance , @xmath50 , and the wavelength , @xmath51 . if the wavelength of the laser is much larger than the separation between the atoms , the whole ensemble couples to the light field as a single degree of freedom .",
    "hence , in this case the degree of collectivity is large , i.e. @xmath52 . in the opposite regime ,",
    "i.e. @xmath53 , the atoms couple independently to the laser and , hence , @xmath54 .",
    "throughout this paper , we will focus mainly in the more interesting intermediate regime @xmath55 .",
    "there , a non - negligible degree of collectivity is present while the specific spatial configuration of the atoms give rise to directionality and other features that we will discuss in the next sections .",
    "we proceed by employing a final approximation which relies on the fact that we are particularly interested in atomic states in which the number of atoms in the state @xmath1 is very small in comparison to the total number of atoms @xmath5 . in this restricted",

    "dropping the notation @xmath56 in the following , the time evolution of the expectation value of @xmath40 can be written in the closed form : @xmath58 using the quantum regression theorem @xcite , we obtain for the time - evolution of the correlation function @xmath59 in order to solve this equation of motion , we introduce the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the operator @xmath42 @xmath60 such that the desired expectation value of the correlations yields @xmath61 introducing this result into equation ( [ eqn : g - coef-2 ] ) , we eventually obtain ( in the limit of @xmath62 ) , @xmath63 these coefficients contain all the information of the mapping ( [ eqn : mapping ] ) and put us in a position to calculate the photonic state ( [ eqn : photon_general ] ) that is created by an atomic excitation of the form ( [ eqn : initial_atomic ] ) .      after these general considerations let us now focus on the particular ring structure of our system .",
    "the @xmath5 atoms are placed on a ring lattice ( one atom per site ) with interatomic spacing @xmath50 .",
    "we consider that the ring lies in the @xmath64-plane .",

    "[ fig : lambda]b . the position of each atom is thus given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 , for @xmath67 . here , @xmath68 is the radius of the ring and it is given approximately ( for large number of sites @xmath69 ) by @xmath70 .",
    "we assume furthermore that the dipoles of the transition @xmath30 are oriented perpendicular to the ring , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "this leads to a particularly simple appearance of the the operator @xmath42 which governs the evolution of the atomic operators .",
    "its matrix representation becomes a circulant matrix , that is , each row contains the elements of the previous one shifted cyclically one place to the right .",
    "in addition , as a consequence of the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath42 is symmetric .",
    "this matrix can be diagonalized analytically @xcite , and its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "this result allows a quasi - analytical treatment of the photon emission by the collective atomic excitations stored in the ring lattice .",
    "having now understood how to map atomic excitations into photonic states we will briefly outline in this section which many - particle states are accessible in the ring lattice , and hence which states can serve as a resource for emitted photons .",
    "we follow the schemes discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite which rely on the properties of atoms excited to rydberg states . to this end",
    "we introduce for each atom the rydberg ns - state @xmath4 which is coupled to the electronic ground state @xmath0 by means of a laser with rabi frequency @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda]a ) .",
    "when the atoms are in the excited state , they interact via the van - der - waals interaction @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the separation between the atoms and @xmath77 is the van - der - waals coefficient @xcite . in the case of rydberg states , this interaction can be very strong even over large spatial separations .",
    "this gives rise to the so - called rydberg blockade , that inhibits the simultaneous excitation of more than one rydberg atom inside a sphere with _ blockade radius _ @xmath78^{1/6}$ ] @xcite .",
    "the size of the blockade radius relative to the interparticle distance @xmath50 will crucially determine the evolution dynamics of the system under the action of the laser coupling from @xmath0 to @xmath4 .",
    "we will make a distinction between the cases in which @xmath79 is ( i ) so large that it encompasses the entire lattice and ( ii ) smaller than the interparticle separation .",
    "we discuss the corresponding schemes for the creation of entangled atomic states for these two cases in the following :    * ( i ) - large blockade radius . *",
    "this case is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : blockade]a . here",
    "the entire lattice is blockaded and the laser coupling @xmath0 to @xmath4 can only excite a single atom to the rydberg state . as a consequence ,",
    "the laser effectively couples the two collective states @xmath80 and @xmath81 with a collective rabi frequency @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "hence , as a result of a pulse of duration @xmath83 a symmetric superposition of all possible single atomic excitations is achieved .",

    "the previous and other entangled atomic states can also be achieved in the regime of a very weak blockade which is sketched in fig .",

    "in particular , the ground state of the hamiltonian is given by the product state @xmath86 .",
    "due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian , only very specific - so - called fully symmetric - states are accessible from the ground state . the first excited fully symmetric state",
    "is given by @xmath87 with @xmath88 . here",
    "only one of the atoms in the ring is in the state @xmath89 , but this excitation is delocalized over the entire ring .",

    "note that these states are superpositions of pairs of excitations that travel in the ring with opposite momentum .",
    "let us point out that the selective excitation of the above - described states is experimentally possible by means of variations in the rabi frequency and detuning of the laser , as it is described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "once the desired entangled states are achieved , one maps the excited states which are encoded in the superpositions @xmath89 and @xmath92 to the stable states of the atomic hyperfine groundstate manifold .",
    "this is done by means of a sequence of two resonant laser pulses ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed explanation ) that perform the mappings @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "we can now use the atom - light mapping presented in sec .",

    "now we perform a detailed analysis of the photonic excitations focussing at first on the single photon state ( [ eqn : single - photon ] ) .",

    "the structure of the intensity profile is severely influenced by the collectivity of coupling of the atoms to the radiation field .",
    "this collectivity is determined by the ratio of the lattice spacing and the laser momentum and increases from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",

    "note that the maximum probability for the detection of the first photon ( maximum of the intensity ) was in the opposite half - space @xmath182 .     and @xmath110 of the two - photon state @xmath183 .",
    "the correlations are calculated fixing one of the angles to the maximum of the intensity marked by the red cross , i.e. , @xmath184 ( note that the angle of incidence of the laser is @xmath176).,width=226 ]",
    "in this work , we have first reviewed the problem of outcoupling non - classical light from a coherently prepared atomic ensemble .",
    "we have explained how for large enough times this process provides a direct mapping between atomic excitations and photonic states .",
    "subsequently we have applied this atom - photon mapping to a set of many - body entangled states that can be created on a ring - shaped lattice .",
    "our analysis of the single photon states that are obtained via the excitation of an atomic spin wave in the ring has revealed two results : first , we have observed that , when the wavelength of the driving laser is smaller than the extension of the system , the photon is emitted into a superposition state of two different directions .",
    "these directions can be tuned by varying the incident angle of the laser with respect to the ring .",
    "second , in the regime where the interatomic separation is of the order of the wavelength @xmath51 , we have shown that it is possible to produce hollow photons with well - defined zero orbital angular momentum .",
    "this is achieved even for small atomic ensembles ( @xmath185 ) due to collective effects in the photon emission .",
    "in addition , we have studied photon pairs that are created from doubly excited entangled states which can be prepared in the ring lattice . during our analysis of the angular density - density correlations of these photon pairs we found that the doubly excited atomic states are in general mapped into entangled photons with non - trivial correlation properties .",
    "the feasibility to create two - dimensional arrays of optical traps which is necessary for the experiment implementation of our scheme has already been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "these trap arrays with site separations on the order of a micrometer and single - site addressability can be used to create experimentally a ring lattice and other complex 2d configurations such as triangular or hexagonal lattices . studying the creation of many - body entangled atomic states along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite in these setups is thus an interesting and exciting future direction - in particular because other geometries are expected to lead to new features of the photonic states .",
    "moreover , the finite strength of the confinement of the atoms in conjunction with a finite temperature will lead to an uncertainty of the atomic positions @xmath186 .",
    "this will produce disorder that affects the preparation of the entangled atomic resource states @xcite as well as the intensity distribution and correlation properties of the emitted photons @xcite .",
    "this will be explored in detail in a future work ."
