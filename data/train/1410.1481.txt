    "the traditional way for a firm to repurchase its own shares is through open - market repurchase programs ( omr ) .",
    "however , as reported in @xcite , after they have announced they intend to buy back shares , a substantial number of firms do not commit to their initial plan .",
    "unexpected shocks on prices or on the liquidity of the stock may indeed provide incentives to slow down , postpone , or even cancel repurchase programs .    in order to make a credible commitment to buy back shares , an increasing number of firms enter accelerated share repurchase contracts with investment banks .",
    "accelerated share repurchase contracts are of several kinds and we traditionally distinguish between asr with fixed number of shares and fixed notional asr .    in the case of an asr with fixed number of shares ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "the contract is the following :    1 .   at time @xmath2",
    ", the bank borrows @xmath1 shares from shareholders ( ordinarily institutions ) and gives the shares to the firm in exchange of a fixed amount @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mark - to - market ( mtm ) price of the stock at time @xmath2 .",
    "the bank then has to progressively buy back @xmath1 shares on the market to give back @xmath1 shares to the initial shareholders , and go from a short position to a flat position on the stock ; 2 .",
    "the bank is long an option with payoff @xmath5 ( the firm being short of this option ) , where @xmath6 is the average price between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( in practice the average of closing prices or the average of daily vwaps ) and where @xmath9 is chosen by the bank , among a set of specified dates , during which the option can not be exercised . ]",
    "@xmath10 .",
    "hence , the firm eventually pays on average the price @xmath11 for each of the @xmath1 shares that have been repurchased .    in the case of a fixed notional asr with notional @xmath0",
    ", the contract is the following :    1 .   at time @xmath2",
    ", the bank borrows @xmath1 shares from shareholders  usually @xmath12 , where @xmath13 $ ] is usually around @xmath14  , and gives the shares to the firm in exchange of the fixed amount @xmath0 ; 2 .",
    "an option is embedded in the contract : when the bank exercises this option at date @xmath9 ( the date is chosen by the bank , among a set of specified dates @xmath10 ) , there is a transfer of @xmath15 shares between the bank and the firm is chosen small enough so that the transfer is almost always from the bank to the firm , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 . in",
    "what follows , we implicitly assume that the settlement is from the bank to the firm . ] , so that the actual number of shares obtained by the firm is @xmath17 .    hence , the firm pays @xmath0 and eventually gets @xmath17 shares .",
    "as above , the bank will also progressively buy shares on the market to give back @xmath1 shares to the initial shareholders .    pricing these contracts and hedging them are mathematical problems that can not be solved in a satisfactory way using the classical theory of derivatives pricing . at time @xmath2",
    ", the bank has a short position on the stock and it will buy shares on the market over a period of a few weeks to a few months . as a consequence ,",
    "the problem is at the same time a problem of optimal execution and a problem of option pricing : a cash - settled exotic option with bermudean exercise dates in the case of an asr with fixed number of shares and a physically - settled exotic option with bermudean exercise dates in the case of a fixed notional asr .",
    "ignoring the interactions between the two problems would lead to a suboptimal strategy and to mispricing .",
    "moreover , since the nominal / notional of these options is large , execution costs must be taken into account and we propose a framework coming from the literature on optimal execution to price and execute optimally these contracts .",
    "the problem of pricing derivative products with large nominal has already been tackled in the literature using the tools of optimal execution .",
    "rogers and singh @xcite considered execution costs that are not linear in ( proportional to ) the volume executed , but rather strictly convex to account for liquidity effects ( as opposed to the literature on pricing with transaction costs  see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "they considered an objective function that penalizes both execution costs and mean - squared hedging error at maturity .",
    "they obtained , in this close - to - mean - variance framework , a closed - form approximation for the optimal hedging strategy of a vanilla option when illiquidity costs are small .",
    "also , li and almgren @xcite , motivated by saw - tooth patterns recently observed on several us stocks ( see @xcite ) , considered a model with both permanent and temporary impact .",
    "in their model , they assumed execution costs are quadratic and they considered a constant @xmath18 approximation . using another objective function , they obtained a closed form expression for the hedging strategy of a call option .",
    "finally , guant and pu proposed in @xcite a method to price and hedge a vanilla option in a utility - based framework , under general assumptions on market impact .",
    "in particular , they considered both the case of physical settlement and the case of cash settlement .",
    "the case of asr contracts is however more complex than the case of vanilla options , because the payoff is not a classical european payoff , but rather an exotic one with asian and bermudean features , and because the problem to be solved is both a problem of option pricing / hedging and a problem of optimal execution .",
    "economists have discussed the role of asr contracts among the different ways to buy back shares ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the mathematical literature on accelerated share repurchase contracts is however rather limited and very recent .",
    "the first paper on the topic is an interesting paper by jaimungal , kinzebulatov and rubisov @xcite .",
    "the authors focus on asr contracts with fixed number of shares . for finding the optimal buying strategy",
    ", they propose a model in continuous time with the following characteristics : stock prices are modeled with a perturbed geometric brownian motion ( the perturbation accounts for permanent market impact ) , execution costs are quadratic as in the original almgren - chriss models @xcite , the range of possible exercise dates is @xmath19 $ ] ( hence the product is american rather than bermudean ) .",
    "the optimal strategy is found in @xcite for an agent who is risk - neutral , although the authors add inventory penalties as in @xcite .",
    "the main interest of @xcite is that the authors manage to reduce the problem to a 3-variable pde , whereas the initial problem is in dimension 5 . in particular , they show that the exercise boundary only depends on the time to maturity and the ratio between the stock price and its average value since inception .",
    "the case of asr contracts with fixed number of shares has also been considered in a different model by guant , pu and royer ( see @xcite ) . in this discrete - time model , a risk - averse agent",
    "is considered in an expected utility framework .",
    "permanent market impact is considered as in @xcite , but stock prices are assumed to be normal rather than log - normal .",
    "also , a general form of execution cost is allowed as in @xcite , and exercise dates are among a finite set of dates . as in @xcite , the model in @xcite",
    "boils down to a set of equations with 3 variables : time , the number of shares to be bought , and the difference between the current stock price and the average price since time @xmath2 .",
    "an original fast tree - based numerical method is proposed in @xcite .",
    "the model we propose in this paper is inspired from @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use the same expected utility framework .",
    "however since we focus on the specific case of fixed notional asr contracts , the reduction of the problem to a 3-dimension one is not possible anymore . in particular , the original tree - based method proposed in @xcite to approximate",
    "numerically the optimal strategy can not be used .",
    "we present in section 2 the framework of the model without permanent market impact . as in @xcite ,",
    "the model is in discrete time and we end up with a characterization of the optimal buying / hedging strategy with recursive bellman equations . in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce these bellman equations , along with a change of variables to reduce the dimensionality of the problem ( from 5 to 4 ) .",
    "we also introduce the indifference price of the asr contract . in section 4",
    ", we present a numerical method involving trees and splines to approximate the solution of the problem , along with examples .",
    "the introduction of permanent market impact is presented in appendix  a.",
    "we consider the pricing and hedging of a fixed notional asr from the point of view of an investment bank buying back shares for a client ( a firm ) . throughout the paper , the notional of the asr contract",
    "will be denoted by @xmath0 and the maturity of the contract will be denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the model we consider is a discrete - time model where each period of time ( of length @xmath21 ) corresponds to one day . in other words ,",

    "in addition to a reduction in the dimension of the problem , the main interest of the change of variables introduced earlier lies in the link between the functions @xmath106 and the indifference price of the asr contract .",
    "the indifference price of the asr contract is , by definition , the amount of cash ( positive or negative ) to give to the bank so that it is indifferent between accepting and not accepting the asr contract .",

    "the functions @xmath106 also enable to understand the different effects at stake when it comes to the execution strategy and the choice of the stopping time .",
    "for that purpose , let us expand the expression for @xmath127 ( we omit superscripts for the sake of simplicity ) .",
    "as proved in appendix  b , we have : @xmath128    to understand the different effects , one has to distinguish between what happens before the option is exercised and after the option is exercised .    before time @xmath68",
    ", the bank buys back shares on the market . as for all execution problems",
    ", there is an execution cost component and a risk component : ( i ) the bank pays execution costs depending on its participation rate to the market ( this is `` liquidity term i '' ) , and ( ii ) the bank is exposed to price moves . however , due to the form of the payoff , the risk is partially hedged .",
    "when prices go up , the bank buys shares at higher prices but the number of shares to buy ( @xmath110 ) decreases . similarly the other way round ,",
    "when prices go down , the bank buys shares at lower prices but the number of shares to buy increases .",
    "contrary to what happens with asr contracts with fixed number of shares , the hedge is only partial in the case of a fixed notional asr : `` risk term i '' can not be set to 0 using an adapted strategy .",
    "after time @xmath68 , the execution costs are similar but the risk is not anymore partially hedged : this is the `` post - exercise  risk - liquidity  term '' ( it requires to choose @xmath73 properly , see remark 2 ) .",
    "the above analysis is linked to the execution process used for buying back shares .",
    "coming to the option , the bank has an incentive to exercise it when @xmath36 is below @xmath92 , since @xmath110 will mechanically go up , as @xmath92 goes towards @xmath36 .",
    "the cost of not exercising now is somehow given by the `` spread term '' .",
    "we see therefore that there is a trade - off between exercising when @xmath36 goes below @xmath92 in order to eventually deliver less shares , and not executing too soon in order to ( partially ) hedge the risk associated with the execution process .",

    "in addition to providing an optimal strategy , we define an indifference price for the contract .",
    "the numerical method we developed for approximating solutions works very well in practice and provides both optimal strategies and prices .",
    "in the setup presented above , market impact was only temporary and boiled down to execution costs . here",
    ", we briefly show how to generalize the previous model in order to introduce a linear form of permanent market impact ( see @xcite for the rationale underlying a linear form of market impact ) .    in this appendix",
    ", we assume that @xmath44 is the closing price of the @xmath207 day and that the average price in the payoff of the asr contract is the average of the closing prices .",
    "the dynamics of the portfolio is the same : @xmath42    the dynamics of the price is however impacted by the strategy of the bank : @xmath208 where the additional term means that the price goes up when the bank buys shares and goes down when the bank sells shares , as in the classical almgren - chriss framework .",
    "the average price is still @xmath38    if we assume that the order of size @xmath40 is executed evenly over the interval @xmath43 $ ] ( in a continuous time almgren - chriss model ) , this leads to the following dynamics for the cash account : @xmath209 where @xmath210 are i.i.d . random variables with moment generating function defined on @xmath31 , with @xmath211=0 $ ] and @xmath212=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } 1 & \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\\\ \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2 } & 1 \\end{array}\\right)$ ] .",
    "the term @xmath213 comes from the fact that the expected value of the price paid for the shares is the average between @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the noise term @xmath216 corresponds to the fact that we execute progressively and evenly over the day while the price @xmath44 is the closing price .",
    "permanent market impact also has to be taken into account in the price paid for the shares after time @xmath68 . for that purpose ,",
    "we replace @xmath217 by @xmath218 .",
    "hence , the optimization problem the bank faces becomes : @xmath219.\\ ] ]    the problem can be solved recursively using the bellman equations : @xmath83@xmath220 where @xmath221.\\label{eq : def - utilde2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we define @xmath222 the recursive equations for @xmath223 given in proposition [ theta ] become : @xmath224 where @xmath225    in that case , approximations with splines need to be used for @xmath36 and @xmath92 .",
    "the problem is therefore slightly more complicated from a numerical point of view , but our framework can be used even in the case when one wants to model permanent market impact ."
