    "the graphene , a single layer graphite , has attracted much attentions of researchers since its discovery in 2004  @xcite due to its unique two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometrical structure and dirac - fermion s electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "many works focus on its transport properties since the charge carrier mobilities of the graphene can reach to more than 10@xmath3 @xmath4v@xmath5s@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the graphene might also be a promising material for spin transport  @xcite and other spintronics applications , such as the spin - qubits  @xcite , due to the weak spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of carbon atom .",
    "this is true since many theoretical works show that the soc - induced band gap at the @xmath6 point ( i.e. dirac point ) of the graphene is very small , which is at the order of 10@xmath1 @xmath7 10@xmath8 ev  @xcite .",
    "however , although the weak soc is good for transporting spin information , but it is probably not favored by others . as we known , the soc is related to many interesting phenomena , such as optical dichroism , anomalous hall effect , and spin hall effect , among which the spin hall effect especially offers a possibility of pure electrically driven spintronics in semiconductors and simple metals  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the tiny soc in a pure graphene makes impossible to observe experimentally the proposed spin hall effect even the temperature goes down to 0.01 k  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite meaningful and important to study how to enhance the soc of the graphene for other applications .",
    "in fact , the curvature effect can mix the @xmath9 and @xmath10 electrons in the graphene and enhance the soc significantly  @xcite , which has been experimentally found in the single - walled carbon nanotube ( swnt )  @xcite .",
    "our recent first principles calculation shows that the soc - induced band splitting can reach to several mev in small diameter swnts  @xcite .",
    "another possible method to enhance the graphene s soc is to form sp@xmath2 bonds by the impurities adsorbed on the sp@xmath11 graphene , which has been proposed by neto and guinea very recently  @xcite .",
    "they show that the impurities can induce the sp@xmath2 distortion of the flat graphene , leading to a large soc enhancement in it , which possibly reaches to about 10 mev , the same order as the intrinsic soc in the carbon atom .",
    "on the other hand , a new kind of 2d crystal , called graphane , has been firstly predicted theoretically  @xcite and then synthesized recently in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "the graphane is nothing but a fully hydrogenated graphene ( h - graphene ) , in which the hydrogen atoms change the hybridizations of carbon atoms from sp@xmath11 to sp@xmath2 , removing the conducting @xmath9 bands near the fermi energy of the pure graphene . as a result ,",
    "the h - graphene is a wide gap semiconductor , which can also be considered as a 2d - like diamond .",
    "in fact , even far before the h - graphene is found , the fluorinated graphite ( f - graphite ) has been synthesized and calculated  @xcite .",
    "it is then straightforward that the fluorinated graphene ( f - graphene ) can also exist and be easily synthesized just like the f - graphite .",
    "the f - graphene has the similar sp@xmath2 hybridizations as the h - graphene and is also a wide gap semiconductor .",
    "however , since fluorine has a much larger electronegativity than hydrogen , we expect that in the f - graphene , the charge transfer between the graphene and dopants is quite different from that in the h - graphene . and the soc in a fluorine atom itself is also different from those in the hydrogen and carbon atoms .",
    "based on the above arguments , we have used the first - principles method to calculate the practical sizes of soc in the h - graphene and f - graphene .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the computational method and details are described .",
    "the main numerical results and discussions are given in sec .",
    "iii . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , a conclusion is presented .",
    "the spin - orbit couplings in the three different systems , i.e. , the pure graphene , h - graphene and f - graphene have been calculated by the density functional theory in the local density approximation implemented in the vasp  @xcite code , in which the projected augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite and the ceperley - alder - type exchange - correlation are used .",
    "the plane - wave cutoff energy is 520 ev throughout the calculations .",
    "a supercell is used to simulate the two dimensional structures , in which the closest distance between two nearest layers is taken to be at least 10  .",
    "a uniform grid of @xmath12 @xmath13 points is used for pure graphene and @xmath14 @xmath13 points for h - graphene and f - graphene . both of the atomic positions and the in - plane lattice constant",
    "are firstly optimized without soc and the residual forces at all atoms are less than 0.005 ev /  .",
    "once the optimized structure is obtained , the band structures with and without the soc are calculated . by comparing the two band structures",
    ", the soc - induced band splitting can be obtained .",
    "we use the same chair structure in the h - graphene as that in the reference  @xcite , whose binding energy is about 0.06 ev / atom lower than the boat structure . the f - graphene is constructed by replacing the hydrogen atoms in the h - graphene with fluorine ones . as a reference , the band structure and soc of the pure graphene is also calculated .",

    "the pure graphene is well known to be a zero gap semiconductor , whose band structure is given in fig.1 .",
    "the linear band structures of @xmath9 electrons touch exactly on the fermi energy at the @xmath6 point .",
    "when the soc is turned on , a small gap can be opened at this point , which is at the order of 10@xmath1 ev .",
    "this is because in the pure graphene only the @xmath9 electrons hopping between the two next nearest neighbor carbon atoms can contribute to the soc , which is the second order process and quite tiny  @xcite .",
    "however , at the @xmath15 point , the two - folding degenerate valence band splits by about 9.4 mev , which is caused by the @xmath10-electrons and much larger than that at the @xmath6 point .    since only the electrons near the fermi energy participate the transport process , some spin - related phenomena can not be observed until the temperature is as low as 0.01 k. in order to get a large soc at the fermi energy , we have to use the @xmath10 electrons .",
    "the recently discovered h - graphene gives us such a system , where the @xmath9 bands are removed by the hydrogen atoms and the @xmath10 bands become the highest occupied molecular state ( homo ) at the @xmath15 point .",
    "we expect a large soc can be found in the h - graphene .",
    "( color online ) the band structure of h - graphene with soc .",
    "the inset shows the detailed band structure near the @xmath15 point . ]",
    "first of all , we can see from table i that the bond lengthes of c - h and c - c are 1.117 and 1.516  , respectively , which are well consistent with sofo _",
    "_ s results  @xcite .",
    "the angle between the c - c and c - h bonds is about 107.3@xmath16 and that between the two c - c bonds is about 111.6@xmath16 .",
    "all these bond lengthes and angles are much like the ones in the diamond rather than in the pure graphene , indicating that the h - graphene is a pure sp@xmath2 carbon system and is somewhat like to a flat 2d diamond .",
    "the band structure of chair - type h - graphene is given in fig .",
    "2 , from which it can be clearly seen that the h - graphene is a wide direct gap semiconductor with its band gap of about 3.38 ev , which is underestimated due to the well - known dft band gap problem .",
    "a recent gw calculation shows that the band gap of h - graphene is 5.4 ev , which is very close to that of the diamond  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly shown by a comparison of fig.1 with fig.2 that the @xmath9 band in the pure graphene disappears in the h - graphene and the @xmath10 band at the @xmath15 point becomes the top of its valence band .",
    "when considering soc , the two fold degenerate @xmath10-bands split near the fermi energy at the @xmath15 point with a gap of 8.7 mev , as shown in the inset of fig.2 .",
    "this value is at the same order as the intrinsic soc of atomic carbon and greatly enhanced , compared with the negligible soc near the fermi level of the pure graphene , which is induced by the @xmath9-bands in it .",
    "this soc - induced band splitting appears at the highest point of the valence band and is very similar to the soc in the archetypical semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) the band structure of f - graphene with soc .",
    "the inset shows the detailed band structure near the @xmath15 point . ]",
    "the fluorinated graphene is also calculated and its band structure is given in fig.3 . obviously , the f - graphene has the similar band structure with the h - graphene , except that more valence bands are found in the f - graphene .",
    "the f - graphene is also a wide direct gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.96 ev , a little smaller than that of the h - graphene .",
    "however , we also expect that the real band gap is about 5 ev if we take into account the same dft underestimation of the band gap as in the h - graphene .",
    "this also gives us a method to tune the band gap of pure graphene by using different adsorbed atoms .",
    "in table i , the c - c and c - f bond lengthes in the f - graphene are shown to be 1.553 and 1.365  , respectively .",
    "the angle between the c - c and c - f bonds is about 108.3@xmath16 , and that between the two c - c bonds is about 110.6@xmath16 , which are all well consistent with the previous calculation  @xcite .",
    "although the bond lengthes are much longer than that in the h - graphene , the f - graphene is also a sp@xmath2 carbon system and therefore both of them have the similar band structures .",
    "it is the most interesting to find that the soc - induced band splitting in the f - graphene can reach to 27.4 mev near the fermi energy , which is far bigger than that of carbon atom .",
    "we believe that this large soc can not be explained only by the sp@xmath2 hybridization of carbon atoms .",
    "what is the difference between the h - graphene and f - graphene ?",
    "we think the main difference between them is that the fluorine atom has a much larger electronegativity than hydrogen atom .",
    "the charge transfers from the carbon atom to fluorine one in the f - graphene and the soc splitting is contributed from both the carbon and fluorine atoms . in order to confirm this hypothesis ,",
    "we have calculated the site and orbital projected wavefunction of homo at the @xmath15 point , whose coefficient can give the band characteristics .",
    "the obtained results show that the homo state of the f - graphene consists of about 60% carbon s @xmath17-electron and about 40% fluorine s @xmath17-electron .",
    "it is known that the intrinsic soc of the fluorine atom is quite larger , which is about 50 or 100 mev by different experiments  @xcite .",
    "so , the large soc splitting in the homo state of the f - graphene comes mostly from that of the fluorine atom , whose mechanism is totally different from that in the h - graphene , where its homo state consists of almost 100% carbon s @xmath17-electron . as a result",
    ", the soc splitting near the fermi energy in the h - graphene has the similar value as that of diamond or carbon atom , while the one in the f - graphene has a much bigger value .",
    "in summary , we have used the first - principles method to calculate the practical soc - induced band splittings of the h - graphene and f - graphene . and",
    "two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the great enhancements of the soc splitting in both of them , in which the carbon atoms hybridizations become the sp@xmath2 from their original sp@xmath11 due to the doped hydrogen or fluorine atoms , making the @xmath10-bands move to the top of their valence bands and a large energy gap to be opened at there .",
    "the soc induced band splitting near the fermi energy of the h - graphene is found to reach to 8.7 mev , which is significantly enhanced by four orders from its original value near the fermi energy of the pure graphene .",
    "more importantly , it is even enhanced to 27.4 mev in the f - graphene , which mainly comes from the larger soc of fluorine atom than the carbon atom .",
    "these large soc values are comparable , respectively , to those found in the diamond and archetypal semiconductors .",
    "so , we hope that the spin hall effect and other soc - related phenomena can be easily found in the h - graphene and f - graphene than that in the pure graphene .",
