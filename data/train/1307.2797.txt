    "with the advent of high luminosity accelerators weak decays of hadrons containing valence charm or bottom quarks can be measured with very high precision .",
    "in fact , such decays might even offer one of the best chances for the discovery of beyond the standard models physics , see the recent reviews @xcite and the citations given there .",
    "so , there is strong motivation to improve on the theoretical description of the qcd input needed for such searches .",
    "one of the most important quantities for such exclusive channels are the hadron distribution amplitudes ( das , often also called wave functions ) and form factors . for each hadron das",
    "are characteristic nonperturbative quantities , just like pdfs . as for the latter",
    ", moments of das can be calculated on the lattice , see e.g. @xcite and rapid progress can be expected along these lines .",
    "nevertheless input from many sides will be needed to understand in the long run the basic systematics of hadron das , even for the most important standard hadrons .",
    "the controversial theoretical discussion spawned by the surprising babar data for the photon - pion transition form factor @xcite has illustrated that this field is still in a pioneering phase .",
    "another non - perturbative approach , besides lattice qcd , to das and form factors are light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite .",
    "as both approaches are conceptually completely different the ideal situation is reached if both give the same results .",
    "we will show that this is what happens , e.g. , for the decays @xmath6 we are analyzing in this contribution .",
    "this case is especially interesting because the singlet - octet mixing of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 should be reflected by the respective form factors , e.g. by a substantially different size of the gluonic contribution , see e.g. @xcite for a recent review .",
    "as this debate is ongoing since many years it would be great news if the gluonic leading fock - state contribution for the @xmath4 could be experimentally determined .",
    "( there always exist gluonic higher fock - state components . )",
    "we will specify observables which are sensitive to this component and thus offer this oportunity .",
    "+ from a theoretical point of view b - mesons would be better suited for our purpose .",
    "there the light - cone expansion exhibits a stronger hierarchy due to the larger mass of the b - quark which in turn reduces the uncertainty coming from the truncation of this expansion .",
    "however in practice this uncertainty is not the dominant one .",
    "+ as for all three cases ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 decays ) the required increase in experimental accuracy looks very much feasible for next - generation experiments and we hope that in a few years from now data for this complete set of meson decays will provide undisputable experimental evidence for the gluonic component of the @xmath4 .",
    "+ the decays @xmath7 have been analysed before both phenomenologically , e.g. , @xcite and using leading order lcsrs with chiral currents including meson mass corrections @xcite .",
    "we improved that lo twist-2 analysis by taking into account all two - particle twist-2 and twist-3 nlo quark contributions and in addition the nlo twist-2 gluon contribution .",
    "the latter allows to extract information on the leading gluon da of the @xmath4 . to achieve this goal we made heavy use of nlo results existing in the literature @xcite .",
    "our results for the decay formfactors agree within uncertainties with those of @xcite .",
    "while this is encouraging , we also feel that it is somewhat fortuitous , because we have some doubts concerning the benefits of the chiral currents used in that work , since they eliminate important nonperturbative information and do not couple only to the pseudoscalar mesons in the hadronic sum .",
    "+ the decays @xmath8 were analysed in @xcite at leading order and in @xcite at the same level of accuracy as in this note .",
    "we improve on the latter calculation by making an analysis of both the branching fractions and their ratios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  ii we discuss the @xmath9 mixing scheme used . in section  iii we outline the derivation of the lcsrs for the different form factors . in section",
    "iv we present our numerical results and in section  v we summarize and conclude .",
    "two different schemes for describing the @xmath10-mixing are commonly used : the singlet - octet ( so ) @xcite and the quark - flavour(qf)-scheme @xcite , see also @xcite for a mixing scheme independent sum rule determination of the couplings of the @xmath11 to the axial currents .",
    "the so - scheme defines two hypothetical pure singlet and octet states @xmath12 and two mixing angles @xmath13 to describe the four decay constants @xmath14 defined as @xmath15 in this scheme @xmath16 describes the contribution of the @xmath17-anomaly via the divergence of the singlet current @xmath18 and the difference @xmath19 and @xmath20 is given by @xmath21-violating effects . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are scale independent and @xmath16 renormalises multiplicatively .",
    "+ in the qf - scheme the basic currents and couplings are given by @xmath24 here the angles are scale dependent and their difference is given by ozi - rule violating contributions .",
    "phenomenologically this difference is very small .",
    "thus the authors of @xcite proposed to use within the qf - scheme the approximation @xmath25 which has only three parameters with the phenomenological values @xmath26 and where the mixing of the states follows the same pattern as for the decay constants : @xmath27 the masses of the states to the order in which we perform our calculations are given by @xcite @xmath28 one important point to note is that in this version of the qf scheme there is no scale dependence left in the parameters .",
    "since the mixing of the two different flavour states is given by ozi - rule violating contributions @xmath29 where @xmath30 are leading twist distribution amplitudes , a consistent implementation requires to set @xmath31 this implies that one has to ignore the different scale - dependence of the singlet and octet distribution amplitudes , because otherwise their evolution would generate a non - zero @xmath32 .",
    "we followed @xcite and set @xmath33 and evolved their lowest moment @xmath34 according to the octet scaling law .",
    "we confirm that the induced difference due to different renormalisation behavior is very small .",
    "we also confirm their finding that the mixing of the leading gegenbauer - moment in the conformal expansion of the twist 2 quark and gluon distribution amplitudes @xmath35 given by @xcite @xmath36 has only small numerical influence .",
    "this led us to neglect this effect in accordance with remarks made above .",
    "higher gegenbauer - moments turned out to give only negligible contributions as well and therefore we restrict our analysis to the lowest moments . on the whole",
    "these effects are smaller than 3% .",
    "the main difference with respect to @xcite , besides using the @xmath37-mass for @xmath38 , is that for the @xmath39 decays we probe the @xmath40-content of the @xmath11 which leads to a different dependence on the mixing angle , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : qf - scheme - correlator ] ) while for the @xmath41 the only difference is the change of borel - parameter , continuum threshold and masses @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the idea behind lcsr calculations for decay matrix elements from heavy into light quark hadrons is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .     is the interpolating current for the heavy meson .",
    "the weak matrix element is contained in @xmath44 and the charm quark propagator is treated perturbatively .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath45 can be calculated purely perturbatively , which is done at nlo accuracy . at that level",
    "the parton lines coupling into the @xmath2 can be either quark - antiquark or two gluons .",
    "the occurring matrix elements are parameterized in terms of the distribution amplitudes .",
    "a borel transform serves to filter out the @xmath0 and @xmath1 contributions from @xmath45 . ]    for a detailed discussion of the original two - point sum rules and their extension consult , e.g. , @xcite . in short",
    "one uses the two - fold nature of the correlation function to equate two different representations : first one inserts a complete set of hadronic states , separates the ground state and expresses the rest via a dispersion integral over the hadronic spectral density .",
    "second one uses that for large negative virtualities the correlation function is dominated by light like distances and makes an expansion around the light - cone leading to a convolution of perturbatively calculable hard scattering amplitudes and universal soft distribution amplitudes . after an analytic continuation of the light - cone expansion to physical momenta using a dispersion relation one equates these two representations by the assumption of quark - hadron duality .",
    "finally it is customary to use a borel transformation to suppress higher states in the hadronic sum and to get rid of subtraction terms which are necessary if the dispersion relation is divergent .",
    "we will illustrate these steps below .",
    "starting point for the @xmath46 form factor @xmath47 is the correlation function : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the on - shell pseudoscalar meson , in our case @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the local weak interaction vertex and @xmath53 is a local interpolating current for the heavy quark system . in the present case we deal with the expressions collected in table  [ currentstabular ] .",
    "the scalar form factor @xmath54 enters the leptonic spectrum only with factors proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "therefore we do not consider @xmath56 which is needed to calculate @xmath57 .",
    "0.3 cm    .currents entering the correlation function eq .  .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     again the ratios turn out to be especially interesting since most of the uncertainties in the theoretical calculation cancel and they are dominated by the contribution of the gluonic gegenbauer - moment @xmath58 .",
    "here we made the same assumption @xmath59 as for the ratios of the form factors . comparing them to the experimental values",
    ", @xmath60 one can see good overall agreement but , as can clearly be seen , the experimental precision is up to now not sufficient to draw any conclusion on @xmath58 .",
    "we have calculated the form factors and branching fractions of the decays @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the framework of light cone sum rules for massless leptons .",
    "the form factors were shown to agree with available lattice results and the branching ratios eq .",
    "( [ eq:42 ] ) with experiment .",
    "so the overall picture is nicely consistent .",
    "our main result is , however , the error budget given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:42 ] ) clearly showing that @xmath58 dominates the uncertainties in all cases .",
    "therefore , already a moderate increase in experimental accuracy will allow to determine the gluonic contribution to @xmath2 and @xmath4 from all three ratios , providing a sensitive consistency check .",
    "fair and super - kekb should even provide precision measurements of these ratios and thus allow to settle this long - standing issue .",
