    "despite much progress , e.g. review by @xcite , the common envelope ( ce ) phase is one of the least understood processes in stellar binary evolution .",
    "the evolution becomes much more complicated if a close tertiary body exists in the system , such that the ce evolution includes three gravitating bodies .",
    "the evolution that formed the galactic millisecond pulsar ( msp ) triple system psr  j0337 + 1715 might have gone through a ce phase involving three stars .",
    "psr  j0337 + 1715 is a triple system that contains a @xmath0 radio msp with a spin period of @xmath1  ms orbited by two white dwarfs ( wds ) @xcite .",
    "the inner wd mass , orbital period , and eccentricity are @xmath2 , @xmath3  day , and @xmath4 , respectively , while those of the outer wd , hereafter the tertiary star , are @xmath5 , @xmath6  day , and @xmath7 .",
    "the system is coplanar to within @xmath8 .",
    "deeper study of the inner wd was conducted by @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose that the progenitor of psr  j0337 + 1715 contained a massive main sequence ( ms ) star of mass @xmath9 , orbited by two lower mass ms stars having masses and orbital periods of @xmath10 and 835  day , for the inner star , and @xmath11 and 4020  day for the outer stars .",
    "one after the other the two stars entered the bloated envelope of the massive star as it became a giant , and ended at very short orbital periods . the neutron star ( ns )",
    "was formed by a core collapse supernova ( ccsn ) of the primary star .",
    "@xcite find the range of parameters that can work for their scenario to be about @xmath12 .",
    "later we find that for our proposed scenario there is a similar freedom in the parameter space that can work .",
    "however , we see two problematic steps in this evolution .",
    "( 1 ) it is not clear how the two stars ended at short orbital periods .",
    "if the inner star managed to eject the envelope , as is assumed in the ce evolution , then there will be no envelope left to bring the outer tertiary star to a short orbital period .",
    "if on the other hand there is enough mass left in the primary envelope to swallow the tertiary star and bring it closer , then we expect the friction to cause the secondary star to collide with the primary core .",
    "we avoid this problem by taking the two outer stars to enter the giant s envelope at the same time as a tight binary system .",
    "( 2 ) nss that are born in ccsne are born with a non - zero velocity , called a kick velocity . as it is very unlikely that the system will stay coplanar after a kick , in the scenario of @xcite the system gains coplanar geometry at a later phase , when the tertiary ( outer ) star overflows its roche lobe and transfers some mass to the inner binary system , now composed of a ns and a ms star .",
    "it is still needed to be shown that such a process is capable in bringing a triple system to coplanar geometry . in our proposed scenario",
    "the ns is formed through accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of an onemg wd .",
    "the amount of baryonic mass ejected in this process is very small , while the neutrinos are expected to escape in a spherical geometry .",
    "no kick perpendicular to the orbital plane is expected .",
    "the only kick is a small one in the orbital plane due to the orbital motion of the wd around the center of mass of the triple system .    in the standard model msps",
    "are formed in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and spin up due to accretion of mass and angular momentum in a roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) from a companion star ( , and references therein ) . in our scenario",
    "most likely the tertiary star causes the aic of the primary star that forms a ns , and the secondary star transfers mass to the primary star and causes it to spin up and become a msp .",
    "triple star evolution has been proposed for binary pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) , such as the peculiar system psr  j1903 + 0327 @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that two ms stars were spiralling together in the envelope of the primary massive progenitor of the pulsar psr  j1903 + 0327 .",
    "the inner companion was later destroyed or ejected , leaving behind the binary pulsar .",
    "again , it is not clear that one envelope can cause substantial spiralling - in of two well separated stars ( the secondary and the tertiary ) .",
    "the problems we find in the scenario proposed by @xcite motivate us to consider a different scenario , also involving a ce phase with three stars , for the formation of psr  j0337 + 1715 .",
    "the large fraction of triple systems among binary stars , e.g. , @xcite who argue that at least @xmath12 of all close binaries have tertiary companions , further motivates us to consider different types of triple systems than previously proposed models for binary and triple pulsar systems . in section [ sec : scenario ] we describe our proposed scenario .",
    "we employ some well studied processes in binary pulsars , e.g. , aic , evolution of close lmxbs , termination of the secondary evolution when its core mass is @xmath13 , and more .",
    "nevertheless , we also include new ingredients .",
    "the new main ingredient , breaking - up a close binary system inside a ce , is presented in section [ sec : binary_ce ] . in section [ sec : pulsar_formation ] we study the evolution of the secondary and tertiary stars to form wds .",
    "our discussion and summary are in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the proposed scenario is described schematically in fig.[fig : mech ] and parameters for one case studied here with _ binary_c _",
    "( @xcite ; section [ sec : pulsar_formation ] ) are listed in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the initial triple - star system is composed from a primary star , the initially more massive ms star , and a tight binary system of lower mass ms stars .",
    "the outer binary system is tight in the sense that the orbital separation of the two outer stars is much smaller than the orbital separation between their center of mass and the massive star .",
    "the interaction starts when the primary star becomes a giant , and its envelope tidally interacts with the tight binary system .",
    "we divide the evolution of the system into five main stages separated by four phases of strong stellar interaction . here",
    "we describe the four interaction phases . the first one is further discussed in section [ sec : binary_ce ] , and the last three interaction phases are studied in section [ sec : pulsar_formation ] .    .",
    "the colors are as follows : grey is for the primary star , blue for the secondary star and red for the tertiary star . as each star reaches a more advanced evolutionary stage its color darkens .",

    "the evolution there after ( phases iii - x ) is calculated with _",
    "binary_c_. stage ix can occur in one of three processes : stable rlof with some mass loss from the second lagrangian point , an efficient ce phase , or a gee .",
    "we here present the ce possibility since it is the obtained secondary evolution in _",
    "binary_c_. , width=566 ]    \\(1 ) _ tidal break - up inside a common envelope . _",
    "the first stage is the most delicate one , as we suggest that two processes occur simultaneously : the chaotic process of tidal break - up and the poorly understood ce evolution .",
    "we start ( phase i in fig.[fig : mech ] ) with a triple system composed of three ms stars of masses @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , which we term the primary , secondary and tertiary , respectively .",
    "the two lighter stars form a tight binary system , for which we estimate the initial orbital separation for a circular ( or low eccentricity ) orbit to be @xmath17 .",
    "this estimate will have to be checked with a three - body numerical code that includes tidal interaction and mass removal by jets from the two stars .",
    "this is way beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the primary evolves and suffers two expansion episodes , when it has a helium core and later when the core is made up mainly from co. because of tidal interaction , most likely the ce occurs in the first expansion episode ( phase ii in fig.[fig : mech ] ) .",
    "the outer binary system enters the envelope of the giant , spirals - in , and removes the hydrogen - rich envelope .    as the outer binary spirals in , it breaks apart because of tidal interaction .",
    "we estimate this to occur when the center of mass of the outer binary is at @xmath18 from the center of the primary .",
    "the secondary star , the lighter one , loses angular momentum more efficiently and spirals - in to an orbital separation of @xmath19 from the @xmath20 helium core of the primary , now having a radius of a @xmath21 .",
    "the tertiary star ends further out .",
    "this is further discussed in section [ sec : binary_ce ] .",
    "\\(2 ) _ agb interaction . _ as the primary continues to evolve and forms an one core ( phase iv in fig.[fig : mech ] ) , the secondary is as massive as the primary s envelope and is able to bring it to co - rotation , enhance the mass loss rate @xcite and expel the entire envelope of the primary ( phase v in fig.[fig : mech ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is possible that the secondary accretes mass through an accretion disc and launches two opposite jets that expel part of the primary he - rich envelope @xcite . if a ce prescription is used , like what we will do later , then the removal of an envelope by spin - up and jets leads to an effective value of the @xmath22 parameter that is larger than unity , @xmath23 . at the end of this phase of evolution the primary forms a @xmath24 onemg wd , and the triple system has the properties listed in the fourth column of table [ tab : parameters ] for a case study .",

    "the post break - up ( bu ) properties are listed in column 3 ( phase iii in fig.[fig : mech ] ) .",
    "note the exchange of inner and outer binary stars from the initial stage to the post break - up stage : the initial tight binary is composed of the secondary and tertiary stars , whereas after the break - up of the secondary- tertiary binary system inside the common envelope , the primary and secondary stars become the inner binary system . the post primary - asymptotic giant branch ( pagb )",
    "properties are listed in column 4 ( phase v in fig.[fig : mech ] ) , where we find the allowed primary post - agb mass to range over @xmath27 . during the following evolution phase of the tertiary ( phase vi in fig.[fig : mech ] )",
    "we find with _",
    "binary_c _ that the tertiary transfers a mass of @xmath28 via rlof to the inner binary .",
    "we take @xmath29 to be accreted by the central binary system taking into account mass loss by jets in the accretion disc around the inner binary . consequently , the primary experiences an aic and forms a ns .",
    "we assume its mass is reduced due to energy carried by neutrinos emitted by the cooling ns . the post aic parameters are listed in column 5 ( phase viii in fig.[fig : mech ] ) .",
    "the next stage is the evolution of the secondary star , ( phase ix in fig.[fig : mech ] ) after which the system reaches its final stage ( column 6 ; phase x in fig.[fig : mech ] ) that corresponds with the observed parameters of the system ( column 7 ) .",

    "_ as the tertiary evolves and becomes an evolved red giant branch ( rgb ) star it interacts with the inner binary system , now composed of an onemg wd and a ms star ( phase vi in fig.[fig : mech ] ) .",
    "two processes take place and lead to the next stage of the triple system that we term _",
    "post tertiary_. the first is tidal interaction that leads to the circularization of the orbit , even if the orbit is very eccentric . for an eccentricity of @xmath30",
    "we find the required semimajor axis before the evolution of the tertiary ( the post primary - agb stage ) to be @xmath31 .",
    "this implies a periastron distance of @xmath32 which leads to a very strong tidal interaction near periastron passages and subsequently to a circular orbit .",
    "these parameters will bring the final result of our simulation even closer to the observed parameters of the system .",
    "the second process is mass transfer .",
    "we find that mass transfer might cause the onemg wd to overpass the chandrasekhar mass limit and suffer an aic ( e.g. , , for recent papers on the formation of msps by aic ) .",
    "although there are large uncertainties , from _",
    "binary_c _ we find that the duration of the rlof from the tertiary star might allow the aic of @xmath33 .",
    "the tertiary star transfers @xmath34 to the central binary system at an average rate of @xmath35 .",
    "this will result in an average mass transfer rate of @xmath36 on to @xmath33 .",
    "this mass transfer is about the rate required to cause an aic .",
    "@xcite found that for the case of a giant donor star there is a narrow region of donor star masses and initial orbital periods that allows aic : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "though @xmath39 is a bit larger than this upper mass limit for @xmath40 the initial period and the estimated mass transfer rate found here are in the range required for an aic .",
    "the tertiary mass can be fitted to the observed value , as we show in section [ sec : pulsar_formation ] .",
    "the mass transfer increases also the mass of the secondary star and leads to a shrinkage in the orbit of the inner binary system ( phase vii in fig.[fig : mech ] ) . in case that the mass transfer from the tertiary star is not sufficient for the primary to undergo aic , only a small amount of mass will accumulate on @xmath33 .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the secondary star , @xmath39 , will lead the onemg wd , @xmath33 , to experience aic and become a ns .",
    "we do not elaborate on this possibility since we find the aic via the tertiary star to be more likely .",
    "we take the resulting ns from the aic to have zero kick velocity as is generally agreed upon from simulations of an aic event @xcite .",
    "mass loss by neutrinos can result in a small kick velocity in the orbital plane of the system due to the orbital motion of the wd around the system s center of mass .",
    "the ns symmetrically loses @xmath41 by neutrinos ( @xmath42 of the total mass of the system ) , with the local ns velocity of @xmath43 ( taking the system parameters at phase vii in fig.[fig : mech ] ) . due to momentum conservation",
    "this will result in a small recoil of the entire system ( @xmath44 ) in the plane of the system alone , without deviating from a coplanar geometry .",
    "\\(4 ) _ secondary evolution . _",
    "the observed mass of the secondary star is @xmath45 , and it is a he wd .",
    "this fits the core of a low mass star during its post - ms evolution , as has been suggested before for low mass binaries (; see section [ sec : pulsar_formation ] for a discussion on the evolution of the remnant he wd ) . in our scenario the secondary and the ns strongly interact when the secondary evolves as a giant ( phase ix in fig.[fig : mech ] ) . according to _ binary_c _",
    "the observed orbital separation of @xmath46 dictates the orbital separation prior to the aic phase to be @xmath47 .",
    "the mass transfer process will occur either through a ce phase ( as given by _ binary_c _ ) or by rlof from the donor star , @xmath39 , to the central ns , @xmath33 .",
    "if only mass transfer through @xmath48 is considered , the orbital separation increases ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the convective envelope and relatively rapid rotation of the secondary star result in a magnetically active star that is most likely to posses an extended corona with a wind .",
    "as the secondary star is already filling its roche lobe , the corona is now extending to the second lagrangian point , @xmath49 , and a large fraction of the mass lost from the extended corona is likely to do so from nearby @xmath49 . as the specific angular momentum of the mass lost through @xmath49 is much larger than that of the binary system , by a factor @xmath50 , the @xmath49 outflow reduces the specific angular momentum of the inner binary system .",
    "this is will lead to a shrinkage in the orbital separation @xcite . from the recent study by @xcite we estimate for the present",
    "studied system that by losing @xmath51 of the total binary mass , @xmath52 , through @xmath49 the orbital separation of the inner binary decreases by a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "this results in a final orbital separation of @xmath54 .    on the other hand , by evolving the inner binary using _",
    "binary_c _ we find that the mass loss from @xmath39 occurs via a ce phase , instead of stable mass transfer via rlof .",
    "the ce phase might be caused by the magnetic activity of the secondary star that causes loss of angular momentum from the system . to account for the observed ( final ) orbital separation of the inner binary , @xmath46",
    ", the ce must be very efficient in removing the envelope .",
    "jets blown by the ns can account for @xmath55 .",
    "the process might even be a grazing envelope evolution ( gee ; @xcite ; see next section ) rather than a ce evolution , which implies an even larger value of @xmath56 ( although this is not a real ce phase ) .",
    "the tidal interaction and ce evolution explain the observed circular orbit .",
    "when we use _ binary_c _",
    "( section [ sec : pulsar_formation ] ) , we can justify taking @xmath55 . during this phase",
    "the secondary loses mass , a small fraction of which is accreted by the ns , the orbital separation of the inner binary decreases and that of the tertiary increases .",
    "overall we point out that the mass transfer can occur in one of the three processes : stable rlof with some mass loss from the second lagrangian point , an efficient ce phase , or a gee .",
    "the final masses and orbital separations are listed in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the tight binary system ( the two lower mass ms stars ) tidally breaks - up approximately when the orbital separation of its center of mass from the primary is ( @xcite ) @xmath57 the ratio of orbital periods at that epoch is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the primary mass inner to the location of the tight binary , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the combined initial mass of the secondary and tertiary stars . from this condition",
    "it is clear that to reach tidal break - up the tight binary must spiral - in such that the orbit @xmath60 shrinks faster than the orbit of the tight binary system @xmath62 .",
    "we now discuss the condition for this to occur .",
    "the tight binary system loses angular momentum of motion around the primary star inside the envelope within a few dynamical times .",
    "this implies that the tidal break up occurs on a scale not much shorter than the spiralling - in time .",
    "both processes must be considered simultaneously .",
    "we can safely say that the friction force of the two ms stars in the envelope can not be neglected . if one of the two ms stars is ejected within the envelope it might lose momentum and stay bound , even if the star is ejected with an initial velocity above the escape velocity .",
    "as we later show , even a very high eccentricity of the outer star s orbit , @xmath63 , will lead to the desired outcome . in a tidal - break up usually",
    "the lower mass companion of the binary is ejected . inside the ce ,",
    "however , dynamical friction with the envelope must be considered .",
    "the outcome might be that the lower mass companion of the tight binary is spiralling - in deeper and the heavier companion ends on a larger orbit , particularly since the difference in mass between the two ms stars is not large .    from preliminary simulations ( michaely , e. , 2015 , private communication )",
    "it turns out that when the tight binary is immersed in the undisturbed giant envelope the tight binary system becomes even harder ( its orbit shrinks ) , and no tidal break - up occurs .",
    "the gravitational drag causes both ms stars to lose energy , such that the orbital separation between them becomes tighter faster than the time on which their distance from the core of the giant star shrinks . in such a case no tidal break - up occurs .",
    "however , if roughly only the star closer to the giant s core suffers from gravitational drag , tidal break - up can occur .",
    "the way to substantially reduce the drag on the outer ms of the tight binary system is to remove the envelope outside the orbit of the tight binary system .",
    "the tight binary system actually experiences a grazing envelope evolution ( gee ; @xcite ) rather than a true ce evolution . in the gee",
    "the binary system might be considered to evolve in a state of `` just entering a ce phase '' .",
    "the companion star in a regular binary system , or the tight binary system in the triple - system case , removes the envelope beyond its orbit by launching jets @xcite .",
    "the removal of the envelope outside the orbit prevents the formation of a full ce phase .",
    "this efficient envelope removal increases the effective value of the ce parameter to values of @xmath64 ( even though no real ce takes place , but rather a gee ) .",
    "we use the population nucleosynthesis code _",
    "binary_c _ of izzard et al ( 2004 , 2006 , 2009 ) based on the binary star evolution ( bse ) code of @xcite . as _ binary_c _ is a stellar population nucleosynthesis framework , we use it to calculate the properties of the system at stages beyond the tidal break - up of the tight binary , i.e. the mass of the each star , orbital separation , etc .    to treat the triple system for each phase of strong interaction",
    "we simulate a binary system .",
    "we give a representative case for the scenario , and later show that there is no need here for heavy fine - tuning , although the parameter space is narrow . at the post",
    "ce break - up phase of the system ( phase iii in fig.[fig : mech ] ) the primary is a he star of mass @xmath65 in an inner binary with the secondary star of @xmath66 .",
    "the primary continues to evolve and forms an one core in the mass range of @xmath67 as it expands along the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ; phase iv in fig.[fig : mech ] ) .    now starts another phase of strong binary interaction .",
    "the secondary is massive enough to bring the primary envelope to co - rotation , and hence enhances the mass loss rate from the primary , up to a factor @xmath68 , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "another process that can aid in removing the primary he - rich envelope is the launching of jets by the ms companion @xcite .",
    "this stage of interaction with tidally - enhanced mass loss rate and possible jets can not be modelled correctly with the",
    "_ binary_c _ code .",
    "we can only mimic these processes by taking the @xmath22 parameter at this stage to be larger than unity .",
    "we here take @xmath69 . from examining other values",
    "we estimate that to reach the observed parameters of the psr j0337 + 1715 system , the inner binary separation at the post ce break - up phase should be in the range of @xmath70 .",
    "once the entire envelope of the primary is ejected it forms an onemg wd , while the secondary star remains a ms star ( phase v in fig.[fig : mech ] ) .",
    "we term this phase the post primary - agb phase of the system and we estimate the separation of the inner binary at this stage to be @xmath71 .",
    "we consider a case study for an example of a possible evolution . we take the immediately post primary - agb system to be composed of an onemg wd of mass @xmath72 , and two ms stars with masses of @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "the orbital separation of the inner ms star and the onemg wd is @xmath75 , and that of the tertiary star from the center of mass of the inner binary is @xmath76 .",
    "circular orbits are assumed for the representative case .",
    "we first follow the evolution of the outer ms star@xmath77the tertiary star , as it is more massive than the secondary star . for the usage of _",
    "binary_c _ we need to treat the inner binary ( the onemg wd + the low mass ms secondary star ) as one star when following the evolution of the outer ms star .",
    "numerically we take the inner binary system as a compact body of mass @xmath78 , and examine how much mass it accretes from the evolving tertiary star ( technically we take it as a ns in _ binary_c _ ) .",
    "as the tertiary star evolves and fills its roche lobe , it transfers a part of its envelope to the inner binary . to account for the mass loss enhancement from the rotation around the massive inner binary @xcite , we take the giant branch wind multiplier to be @xmath79 in _ binary_c_. the tertiary ends this phase of evolution as a he wd of mass @xmath80 ; this will be its final mass .    with _",

    ". some fraction , @xmath81 , of this mass might be blown away by jets launched by the accretion discs around the two stars .",

    "binary_c _ that the duration of the rlof allows a mass transfer from the tertiary to the primary at a rate appropriate to cause an aic .",
    "the reduction in the mass of @xmath33 is due to energy carried by neutrinos emitted by the cooling ns . considering the mass loss to jets and neutrinos ,",
    "the orbital separation of the tertiary star from the center of mass of the inner binary is somewhat larger than what the _",
    "binary_c _ simulation gives .",
    "we find the separation at the end of the tertiary evolution and aic stage to be @xmath85 ( phase viii in fig.[fig : mech ] ) .",
    "the inner binary system is composed now of a ns of mass @xmath86 and a ms star of mass @xmath87 orbiting each other with an orbital separation of @xmath88 .    we next run _ binary_c _ for the inner system as the secondary star evolves off the ms and forms a he core ( phase ix in fig.[fig : mech ] ) .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : scenario ] , the mass transfer can occur in one of three processes : stable rlof with some mass loss from the second lagrangian point , an efficient ce phase , or a gee . in the case of a stable rlof with mass loss from the second lagrangian point",
    ", we estimated in section [ sec : scenario ] that to reach the final inner binary separation of @xmath89 , a mass of @xmath90 should be lost from the second lagrangian point .",

    "binary_c _ results in a ce phase .",

    "similar to the agb interaction phase , we can only mimic this high efficiency by taking a high value of @xmath22 . using _",
    "binary_c _ for our case study with @xmath91 we find at the end of this stage the final masses of the ns and the secondary star , now a he wd , to be @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , respectively , and their orbital separation to be @xmath94 . due to the mass loss by the inner binary system , the orbital separation of the tertiary star increases from @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",

    "we also find that a tertiary post primary - agb eccentric orbit can be circularized as the tertiary becomes a giant and tidally interacts with the inner binary .",
    "for example , taking for the post primary - agb tertiary orbit an eccentricity and semimajor axis of @xmath30 and @xmath103 , respectively , leads to the desired post - tertiary parameters .",

    "the final mass of the secondary star , @xmath104 , does not depend much on the post primary - agb separation as well . during the post ms evolution of the secondary star it substantially expands as a giant when its helium - core mass is @xmath13 , and a strong interaction with the ns companion removes",
    "the secondary envelope ( either in a ce phase or by rlof , see section [ sec : scenario ] ) .",

    "he found that the degenerate helium core of the ( sub)giant determines the radius and luminosity of the remnant .",
    "we point out that in our model we concentrate on a scenario where the secondary star had begun evolving after the aic of the ns primary .",

    "we proposed a scenario for the triple system psr  j0337 + 1715 composed of a pulsar orbited by two white dwarfs ( wds ) @xcite .",
    "our proposed scenario is described in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] , and the values for a case study at the different evolutionary phases are given in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the triple pulsar system psr j0337 + 1715 raises two puzzles .",
    "( 1 ) what initial setting can lead to a very close inner wd , the secondary , orbiting a pulsar , and a wd , the tertiary , at an orbital separation of about the size of a giant star .",
    "it is clear that the secondary wd could not have evolved through a regular common envelope ( ce ) phase with the progenitor of the neutron star ( ns ) without the influence of the tertiary star .",
    "( 2 ) the triple system is coplanar , indicating that no violent event could have taken place , and the system started coplanar .",
    "this suggests that the ns was formed by accretion induced collapse ( aic ) rather than by a core collapse supernova .",
    "we propose that the aic is caused by mass transfer from the tertiary star during its red giant phase ( phases vi - viii in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] ) .",
    "our scenario can also accommodate an aic induced by mass transfer from the secondary star .",
    "we do not focus on this scenario since we find the aic at an earlier stage through mass transfer from the tertiary star to be more plausible .",
    "to solve these puzzles we have introduced to the scenario two new ingredients .",
    "the first one is the entrance of a relatively close binary system ( the tight binary system ) into the envelope of the primary star during its giant phase .",
    "namely , the two lower - mass stars enter the primary envelope together , rather than one after the other as in the scenario of @xcite . the second new ingredient is the process of grazing envelope evolution ( gee ; @xcite ) .",
    "we assumed that the secondary - tertiary tight binary system evolves in a gee , such that the giant primary envelope outside the center of mass of the tight binary system is removed . the spiralling - in process while grazing the giant envelope is a gee .",
    "namely , the outer star , or a tight binary system , is evolving in a ` just enters a ce phase ' .",
    "jets launched by the compact companion , or by one or two of the stars in a tight binary , remove the giant envelope outside the orbit .",
    "if one is to use the @xmath22 parameter , then this efficient envelope removal increases the effective value of the ce parameter to values of @xmath64 . in the tight binary system",
    "only the star that is closer to the center of the primary star suffers the full gas dynamical friction by the envelope .",
    "the other star is in a region where the envelope gas has been removed already .",
    "we consider here an outcome where the tight binary spirals - in and tidally breaks - up , such that the lighter secondary star in - spirals and forms a binary system with the massive primary core , whereas the heavier tertiary star ends on a larger orbit .",
    "we then used the _",
    "binary_c _ numerical code @xcite to further evolve the system , first the tertiary star and then the secondary star , as described in section [ sec : pulsar_formation ] . here",
    "as well we had to assume that tidal spin - up and/or jets launched by the compact star aid in removing the envelope .",
    "this implies that we can use a value of @xmath64 .",
    "we used values of @xmath112 when we evolve the primary star ( iv .",
    "agb interaction in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] ) and @xmath113 when we evolved the secondary star ( ix .",
    "secondary evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] ) .",
    "it is quite possible that during the later ce phases , iv and ix in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] , not only do the jets aid in removing the envelope , but the jets are very efficient in doing so and lead to a gee @xcite , at least during part of the strong interaction phase . on the other hand we do not rule out that the secondary evolution ( phase ix ) occurs through rlof with mass loss enhancement through the second lagrange point due to the corona of the giant secondary star .",
    "both cases of secondary evolution , either ce or rlof , will result in the shrinkage of the inner binary orbital separation .",
    "we also show that no heavy fine - tuning is required to achieve the triple system psr  j0337 + 1715 when one considers tidally enhanced mass loss and jet - removal of the envelope . the parameter space to reproduce",
    "the system is not large , though .",
    "our results have more general implications in showing that a ce with a binary system entering the envelope of a giant star can lead to a rich variety of evolved triple systems .",
    "the survivability of the three stars in such an evolution can be accounted for if the removal of an envelope of a giant star with tidal spin - up and jets is considered .",
