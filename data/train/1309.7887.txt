    "superconductors derived from the ` parent ' compound bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 are amongst the most heavily studied of the iron arsenides over the last four years @xcite .",
    "bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 crystallizes in the so - called ` 122 ' tetragonal structure at room temperature but orders antiferromagnetically below 139 k with a simultaneous structural transition to orthorhombic symmetry @xcite . both the orthorhombic and tetragonal structures contain fe@xmath5as@xmath5 layers , in which the iron atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated with arsenic atoms . as with the other iron - based superconductors , the suppression of spin density wave ( sdw ) order and the emergence of superconductivity can be controlled by electron- or hole - doping through aliovalent substitution on the barium or iron sites@xcite , by isovalent substitution on the arsenic sites@xcite , or by the application of external or chemical pressure @xcite .    in the electron - doped systems , such as ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 and ba(fe@xmath0ni@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 , the maximum _",
    "_ t__@xmath6 is  25 k and superconductivity vanishes at only 0.12 electrons / fe atom @xcite .",
    "it is well established that the magnetic and structural transitions are separated and that superconductivity and magnetism coexist microscopically as shown by local probes such as muon spin rotation ( sr ) @xcite or nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements @xcite . on the other hand , superconductivity in the hole doped ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 system extends up to 0.5 holes / fe atom , i.e. , to kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 , with a maximum _ _ t__@xmath6 of 38 k , significantly higher than the electron - doped materials @xcite .",
    "an important advantage is that the doping is intrinsically cleaner ; since the potassium substitution on the barium sites leaves intact the superconducting fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layers",
    ". the microscopic coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 was recently established by neutron diffraction @xcite and sr measurement @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also reported a strong magneto - elastic coupling in ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 as shown by the coincident first - order magnetic and structural transitions and the identical temperature dependence of the magnetic and orthorhombic order parameters .",
    "we discussed the theoretical implications of this coupling and the origin of the electron - hole asymmetry in the phase diagram .",
    "therefore , it is essential to determine whether this is a common property for all hole - doped 122 systems or that the k substituted system may constitute a special case perhaps due to the nearly similar ionic sizes of eight coordinated barium ( 1.56 ) and potassium ( 1.65 ) . in this paper , we report similar findings for the alternative hole - doped ba@xmath0na@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 system in which the sodium ions ( 1.32 ) are significantly smaller than barium ions @xcite .    in recent work ,",

    "there is evidence of a reduced superconducting phase fraction of  30% at _ x _ = 0.3 , but it is not clear if this is intrinsic or due to chemical inhomogeneity .",
    "the researchers reported broad superconducting transitions and noisy lattice parameters , which probably resulted from the difficulty in controlling the synthesis chemically because of the large size mismatch between ba and na and the volatility of the latter at high temperatures .",
    "sodium has also been used as a dopant in the other divalent iron arsenides ( sr , ca , eu ) to successfully induce superconductivity .",

    "the _ a_-axis is weakly temperature dependent and decreases monotonically as expected by a nave size comparison but the behavior of the _ c_-axis is remarkable in that it shows a bell shaped response to the increasing na content peaking at @xmath24 . a clear evidence for this behavior is also seen in the raw data of the ( 002 ) peak shown in fig .",
    "this is rather different than other systems such as the k - doped , where the c - axis increases monotonically , and the co - doped , where there are only small changes in lattice parameters .",
    "generally , one would expect behavior that follows vegard s law : constant change in volume and lattice parameters scaled by the two end points . in this case , the na ion is significantly smaller than ba ( 1.32 vs 1.65 ) , indeed so much so that the substitution constitutes a significant strain .",
    "this is related to why another form , nafeas ( the 111 phase ) , has an extra layer of alkali atoms inserted between the fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layers .",
    "the _ a _ site void size is set in part by the fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layer spacing and is relaxed in the 111 structure by introducing twice as many a sites , which are staggered to accommodate the ionic radius .",
    "these chemical considerations complicate the picture , so it is better to first discuss the k - substituted phase diagram where this problem is not present , and then apply the conclusions to the na version .",
    "potassium is slightly larger than barium ( 1.65 vs. 1.56 ) , and the kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 end member is a stable thcr@xmath5si@xmath5-type phase .",
    "there are two primary size considerations in substituting ba with k : cation size and fe oxidation state ( or , put differently , the band filling of the ( fe@xmath5as@xmath5 ) layer ) .",
    "replacing ba@xmath7 with the slightly larger k@xmath25 ion should expand the lattice , but it also affects the oxidation state of the fe atom .",
    "the formal oxidation states are fe@xmath26 in bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 and fe@xmath27 in kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "thus , as fe is oxidized by k substitution , the intralayer fe - fe spacing should shrink , which will decrease _ a _ and also change the shape of the feas@xmath28 tetrahedra .",
    "the fe - as bond length stays almost constant as a function of composition ( see below ) , which means that a decrease in fe - fe causes an increase in the width of the layer ( illustrated schematically in figure 6c ) . in general",
    "one would expect that the above electronic considerations will have a stronger effect on the _ ab _ plane size than the a site cation , but that both will have an effect on the _ c _ axis .",
    "this is what is observed ; as k is substituted for ba , the _",
    "c_-axis increases while the _ ab _ area contracts .",
    "indeed , the contraction in _ ab _",
    "area is also observed for other @xmath29na@xmath9fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( _ a _ = sr , ca , and eu)@xcite , even though na@xmath8 is larger than ca@xmath7 , which shows that the contraction is a direct result of the oxidation of the iron species .",
    "the net effect in ba@xmath0k@xmath9fe@xmath2as@xmath2 is actually a decrease in volume , though intriguingly at around 50% substitution the values appear to become nearly constant .",
    "this may be due to the trade - off between local and itinerant states of the fermi electrons , a balance that may change as the fermi - level changes .        for the _ c_-axis itself",
    ", it can be understood as the sum of two physically meaningful parameters : the thickness of the fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layer and the as - as separation between the layers ( illustrated in figure 6b ) .",
    "the composition dependence of these parameters is plotted in figure 6a , left panels .",
    "the former is controlled by the bonding in the _",
    "ab_-plane , and thus is most effected by atomic radius and bond lengths of the fe and as species , while the latter is dominated by the as - as interaction and the _ a _ cation size .",
    "both of these increase approximately monotonically with k substitution , indicating that the as - as separation is sensitive to the k size ( as - k bond length increases compared to as - ba ) , while the increase in the fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layer thickness indicates that oxidation of fe broadens the tetrahedral layer .",
    "this is primarily steric : as the _ ab _ plane shrinks , the as - fe bond remains roughly the same length , so in order to keep the bond constant the as atoms must move out of plane ( figure 6c ) .",
    "the layer width difference between bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 and kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 is 0.158 ( 5.9% ) . for the as - as separation",
    ", it increases 0.263 ( 7.0% ) , which is quite substantial , yet the commensurate drop in cross - sectional area ( @xmath30 ) yields a negligible volume change of 0.453 @xmath15 or 0.8% ( figure 6a , top right panel ) . comparing the actual chemical separation around",
    "the _ a _ site shows that ba - as = 3.38 and k - as = 3.40 , which is somewhat smaller than the radial size differences between ba and k. taken together this implies that the overall interlayer spacing is mostly a steric effect , with decreases in a inducing increases in _ c _ in order to keep an approximately constant _ a _ site cage size .    in the na substituted system , the _ ab _ plane shrinks a similar amount as it does in the k system for _ x _ = 0.5 , _ a _ = 3.8894 and 3.8692 , a decrease of 1.7 and 2.2% for k and na substitution , respectively .",
    "the larger decrease in the na samples is expected as a consequence of the steric strain from the very small na atom . for the _",
    "c_-axis , the fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layer thickness increases as it does in the k system , but the as - as separation shrinks slightly from @xmath31 , and then starting around _ x _ = 0.3 decreases dramatically . plotting the volume of this slab shows a large , nearly linear decrease up to 5.63 @xmath15 ( 9.5% ) by _ x _ = 0.7 .",
    "thus , the unusual shape of the as - as separation along the _ c _ axis is merely an expression of the fact that the monotonically contracting a lattice parameter driven by the fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layer has a non - linear effect on the _ a _ site cage volume .",
    "taking this together with the constantly increasing fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layer width gives the overall _ c_-axis behavior that is observed .",
    "this means that despite their differences , the compositional lattice parameter trends in both systems can be understood as being primarily controlled by the fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layeritself controlled by the oxidation state of the ironwith secondary steric effects involving interlayer spacing compensating for the change in volume from the fe - fe shortening to accommodate the _ a _ site cation size .",
