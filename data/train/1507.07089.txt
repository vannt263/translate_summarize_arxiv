    "the use of scoring rules has a long history in statistics .",
    "an early contribution was the idea of minimizing the sum of square deviations that dates back to gauss and works perfectly for gaussian distributions . in the 1920 s ramsay and de",
    "finetti proved versions of the dutch book theorem where determination of probability distributions were considered as dual problems to maximizing a payoff function .",
    "later it was proved that any consistent inference corresponds to optimizing with respect to some payoff function .",
    "a more systematic study of scoring rules was given by mccarthy @xcite and has recently been studied by dawid , lauritzen and parry @xcite where the notion of a local scoring rule has been extended .",
    "the basic result is that the only strictly local proper scoring rule is logarithmic score .",
    "thermodynamics is the study of concepts like heat , temperature and energy .",
    "a major objective is to extract as much energy from a system as possible .",
    "concepts like entropy and free energy play a significant role .",
    "the idea in statistical mechanics is to view the macroscopic behavior of a thermodynamic system as a statistical consequence of the interaction between a lot of microscopic components where the interacting between the components are governed by very simple laws . here",
    "the central limit theorem and large deviation theory play a major role .",
    "one of the main achievements is the formula for entropy as a logarithm of a probability .",
    "one of the main purposes of information theory is to compress data so that data can be recovered exactly or approximately .",
    "one of the most important quantities was called entropy because it is calculated according to a formula that mimics the calculation of entropy in statistical mechanics .",
    "another key concept in information theory is information divergence ( kl - divergence ) that was introduced by kullback and leibler in 1951 in a paper entitled information and sufficiency .",
    "the link from information theory back to statistical physics was developed by e.t .",
    "jaynes via the maximum entropy principle .",
    "the link back to statistics is now well established @xcite .",
    "the relation between information theory and gambling was established by kelly@xcite .",
    "logarithmic terms appear because we are interested in the exponent in an exponential growth rate of of our wealth .",
    "later kelly s approach has been generalized to training of stocks although the relation to information theory is weaker @xcite .",
    "related quantities appear in statistics , statistical mechanics , information theory and finance , annd we are interested in a theory that describes when these relations are exact and when they just work by analogy . first we introduce some general results about optimization on convex sets .",
    "this part applies exactly to all the topics under consideration and lead to bregman divergences .",
    "secondly , we introduce a notion of sufficiency and show that this leads to information divergence and logarithmic score .",
    "this second step is not always applicable which explains when the different topics are really different .",
    "proofs of the theorems in this short paper can be found in an appendix that is part of the arxiv version of the paper .",
    "the present notion of a state space is based on @xcite , and is mainly relevant for quantum systems .    before we do anything we prepare our system .",

    "let @xmath8 denote a set of feasible measurements .",
    "the state space @xmath9 is defined as the set of preparations modulo measurements .",
    "thus , if @xmath2 and @xmath10 are preparations then they represent the same state if @xmath11 for any @xmath12    in statistics the state space equals the set of preparations and has the shape of a simplex .",
    "the symmetry group of a simplex is simply the group of permutations of the extreme points . in quantum theory",
    "the state space has the shape of the density matrices on a complex hilbert space and the state space has a lot of symmetries that a simplex does not have .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the state space is a finite dimensional convex compact space .",

    "statistical mechanics can be stated based on classical mechanics or quantum mechanics . for our purpose",
    "this makes no difference because theorem [ thm : generelt ] can be applied for both classical systems and quantum systems .",
    "if we restrict to any commutative sub - algebra the divergence is proportional to information divergence as stated in theorem [ thm : jiaovenkat ] so that @xmath18 is proportional to the entropy function @xmath76 restricted to the sub - algebra .",

    "@xmath80    now @xmath81 hence @xmath82 so that @xmath83 the amount of extractable energy @xmath84 is proportional to information divergence .",
    "the quotient between extractable energy and information divergence depends on the temperature and one may even define the absolute temperature via the formula @xmath85 where @xmath86 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "equation ( [ eq : kelvin ] ) was derived already in @xcite by a similar argument .    according to equation ( [ eq : kelvin ] ) any bit of information",
    "can be converted into an amount of energy !",
    "one may ask how this is related to the mixing paradox ( a special case of gibbs paradox ) . consider a container divided by a wall with a blue and a yellow gas on each side of the wall .",
    "the question is how much energy can be extracted by mixing the gasses ?",
    "we loose one bit of information about each molecule by mixing the gasses , but if the color is the _ only difference _ no energy can be extracted .",
    "this seems to be in conflict with equation ( [ eq : kelvin ] ) , but in this case different states can not be converted into each other by reversible processes . for instance one can not convert the blue gas into the yellow gas . to get around this problem",
    "one can restrict the set of preparations and one can restrict the set of measurements . for instance one may simply ignore measurements of the color of the gas .",
    "what should be taken into account and what should be ignored , can only be answered by an experienced physicist .",
    "formally this solves the mixing paradox but from a practical point of view nothing has been solved .",
    "if for instance the molecules in one of the gasses are much larger than the molecules in the other gas then a semi - permeable membrane can be used to create an osmotic pressure that can be used to extract some energy .",
    "it is still an open question which differences in properties of the two gasses that can be used to extract energy .",
    "let @xmath87 denote _ price relatives _ for a list of stocks .",
    "for instance @xmath88 means that stock no .",
    "5 increases its value by 4 % .",
    "a _ portfolio _ is a probability vector @xmath89 where for instance @xmath90 means that 30 % of your money is invested in stock no .",

    "on the level of optimization the theory works out in exactly the same way in statistics , information theory , statistical mechanics , and portfolio theory .",
    "the sufficiency condition is more complicated to apply .",
    "it requires that we restrict to a certain class of mappings of the state space into itself . in the case",
    "where the state space can be identified with a set of density matrices one should restrict to completely positive maps . in case the state space has a different structure it is not obvious which mappings one should restrict to .",
    "the basic problem is that we have to introduce a notion of tensor product for convex sets and it is not obvious how to do this , but this will be the topic of further investigations and results on this topic may have some impact on our general understanding of quantum theory .",
    "the original paper of kullback and leibler @xcite was called `` on information and sufficiency '' . in the present paper",
    "we have made the relation between information divergence and the notion of sufficiency more explicit .",
    "the idea of sufficiency has different consequences in different applications but in all cases information divergence prove to be the quantity that convert the general notion of sufficiency into a number . for specific applications one can not identify the sufficient variables without studying the specific application in detail . for problems like the the mixing paradox there is still no simple answer to the question about what the sufficient variables are , but if the sufficient variables have been specified we have the mathematical framework to develop the rest of the theory in a consistent manner .",
