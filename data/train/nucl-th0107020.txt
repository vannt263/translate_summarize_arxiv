    "in a fusion reaction the projectile and target nuclei form an excited compound system , which decays by emission of particles or gamma rays . when there are channels strongly coupled to the elastic channel , the reaction may be described using any of the available coupled channels codes .",
    "the effects of such couplings have been extensively discussed in the literature da85 . in general terms , at energies below that of the coulomb barrier , these couplings tend to reduce the effective fusion barrier , which substantially increases the fusion cross section . at high energies the incident flux in the elastic channel",
    "is partially diverted into inelastic and transfer channels .",
    "this tends to decrease the contribution of the elastic channel to the fusion cross section , but this reduction is partially compensated by the contribution from the other channels .    the recent availability of radioactive beams has made possible to study reactions involving unstable nuclei .",
    "such reactions are important in processes of astrophysical interest , as well as in the search for superheavy elements .",
    "the main new ingredient in reactions induced by unstable projectiles is the strong influence of the breakup channel . in the case of not too unstable projectiles ,",
    "the effect of this channel in the fusion cross section at low energies is , as in the case of stable beams , to enhance it . at high energies , however , the situation is qualitatively different from the case where only stable nuclei are involved .",
    "the contribution from the breakup channel to the fusion reaction is strongly influenced by the low probability that all fragments are captured .",
    "thus , in this case , the fusion cross section is partitioned into a complete and one or more incomplete fusion contributions @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the breakup channel into a coupled channels calculation is by no means trivial .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that this channel lies in the continuum , and involves a , at least , three body system .",
    "this problem has been addressed by several authors , using different approaches .",
    "several recent experiments involving fusion of neutron rich @xmath0he and proton rich @xmath1f with heavy targets have been performed with the purpose of exploring these theoretical proposals  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the coupled - channel problem is simplified by the introduction of the polarization potentials arising from the coupling with the breakup channel@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the coupled - channel problem is solved directly within different approximation , ranging from the schematic model of dasso and vituri da94 to the huge calculation of hagino _",
    "et al._@xcite , performed through continuum discretization .    the polarization potential approach of refs .",
    "@xcite has the advantage of leading to simple expressions , which can easily be used in data analysis@xcite .",
    "however , it employs several approximations which were not thoroughly tested .",
    "these approximations can be grouped in two cathegories . in the first are those used in the derivation of the polarization potentials . in the second",
    "are the semiclassical approximations for fusion and breakup coefficients , used in calculations of the cross sections .",
    "these coefficients are written in terms of barrier penetration factors and survival probabilities , which are evaluated within the wkb approximation .",
    "the aim of the present work is to ascertain the quality of the approximations for the transmission coefficients .",
    "approximations in the derivation of the polarization potential will be the object of a latter study . for our purposes ,",
    "we consider a case where a complete quantum mechanical calculation is feasible and compare exact and approximated cross sections .",
    "we study the @xmath2li + @xmath3c collision , using typical optical and polarization potentials . for simplicity",
    ", our polarization potential has no angular momentum or energy dependence and the range is given by the @xmath4li breakup threshold energy .",
    "the strength is consistent with that found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the most relevant partial waves in near - barrier fusion .",
    "the plan for this paper is as follows : in section ii we briefly revise the coupled channels formalism and the concept of a polarization potential . in section iii",
    "we discuss different approximation for the transmission coefficients and investigate their consequences on the fusion and breakup cross sections .",
    "finally , in section iv , we present the conclusions of this work .",
    "in a standard coupled channels calculation , the system is described through the distance between centers of projectile and target , * r * , and a set of intrinsic coordinates , @xmath5 , that describe the internal degrees of freedom of one of the nuclei , _",
    "e.g. _ the target .",
    "these coordinates are associated to an intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath6 and its eigenfunction set ,    @xmath7    where    @xmath8    the system hamiltonian may then be written as    @xmath9    above , @xmath10 is the kinetic energy of the relative motion , @xmath11 is the optical potential and @xmath12 is the interaction coupling intrinsic and collision degrees of freedom .",
    "the optical potential , which is diagonal in channel space , accounts for the average interaction between projectile and target .",
    "usually the solution of schrdinger s equation    @xmath13    where @xmath14  is the collision energy in the center of mass frame , is expanded as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 describes the relative motion in channel @xmath17 . substituting this expansion in eq .",
    "( [ schro1 ] ) we obtain the coupled channels equations ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) ,    @xmath18    above , @xmath19 and @xmath20 where    @xmath21    is the optical potential _  _ in channel _  _",
    "the imaginary parts have the purpose of accounting for the flux lost to channels neglected in the expansion of eq.([chan - exp ] ) .",
    "the channel coupling potentials , in eq.([cc ] ) are given by @xmath23    a consequence of the non - hermitian nature of @xmath24 ( see eq.([defopt ] ) ) is that the continuity equation breaks down .",
    "this can be checked following the usual procedure to derive the continuity equation .  for each @xmath25",
    "we evaluate @xmath26 \\,-\\ , \\left [ \\text{eq}.(\\text{\\ref{cc}})\\right ] ^{\\ast}\\times \\psi _ { \\alpha } ( { \\bf r})$ ] and then sum the results . assuming that @xmath27  is hermitian , we obtain @xmath28 integrating the above equation inside a large sphere with radius larger than the interaction range and using the definition of the absorption cross section , we obtain the useful relation@xcite      in some coupled channel problems , it occurs that one is only interested in the elastic wave function .",
    "one example is the study of complete fusion in collisions involving nuclei far from stability , where the breakup threshold is very low .",
    "an extreme example is @xmath2li , which has no bound excited state . in such cases ,",
    "the coupled channel problem involves only the elastic and the breakup channels .",
    "since the breakup channels contain at least three fragments , their contribution to complete fusion is expected to be negligible .",
    "therefore , only the elastic wave function is required for the calculation of the complete fusion and breakup cross sections .    in such cases ,",
    "the _ polarization potential _ approach becomes very convenient .",
    "it consists of replacing the coupled channel equations by a single schrdinger equation for the elastic state .",
    "this equation contains a _ polarization _ term , @xmath30 , added to the optical potential and its solution is identical to the elastic wave function obtained from the coupled channel equations . according to feshbach@xcite , the polarization potential is obtained through elimination of the coupled channel equations for excited states and it is given by    @xmath31    above , @xmath32 is the projector on the elastic channel , @xmath33 , and the propagator @xmath34 is defined as    @xmath35    the wave function is then obtained by solving    @xmath36    which , in the position representation is written    @xmath37\\psi({\\bf r})-\\int u^{pol}({\\bf r } , { \\bf r}% ^{\\prime})\\:\\psi({\\bf r}^{\\prime})d^3{\\bf r}^{\\prime}=0\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the nonlocal potential    @xmath39    in principle , evaluating the polarization potential is nearly as hard as solving the coupled channel equations .",
    "however , for practical purposes it is replaced by trivially equivalent local potentials , which are calculated with approximations@xcite .      with the introduction of the polarization potential , any flux going away from the elastic channel is treated as absorption .",
    "the sum in eq .",

    "it includes the breakup cross section and also a cross section for absorption in the breakup channels , probably incomplete fusion .",

    "the imaginary part reduces the cross section both above and below the barrier .",
    "when both the real and imaginary parts are included , there is a competition between the effects of the real and imaginary parts . with the polarization strength values considered above , suppression dominates above the barrier and enhancement below it",
