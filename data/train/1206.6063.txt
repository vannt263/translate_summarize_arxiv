    "the field of particle physics is in a state of excitement , accompanied by anxiety . on one hand ,",
    "the long - awaited higgs particle has finally appeared  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there appears to be no new physics below the tev scale , and one is worried what really stabilizes the higgs mass at 126 gev .    while the existence of a new particle is beyond doubt , and it is most likely the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) , its true nature needs further scrutiny with more data . in the july 2012 announcement  @xcite ,",
    "both the atlas and cms experiments found enhanced production of the @xmath0 mode . however , despite sensitivity , the cms experiment did not seem to detect any signal in the fermionic modes .",
    "these two aspects sparked discussion  @xcite that the object could be the dilaton of scale invariance violation .",
    "the dilaton coupling to vector bosons and fermions are suppressed by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the vacuum expectation value and @xmath7 the dilaton decay constant .",
    "in contrast , the effective @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings are determined by the trace anomaly , and depend on the number and nature of extra particles ( fermions especially ) . thus , if the observed signal arises mostly from gluon fusion , a dilaton could mimic the sm higgs boson .",
    "discrimination is provided by the detection of higgs production through vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , or bremsstrahlung off a vector boson ( vh ) .",
    "so , in particular , it is the vbf produced @xmath0 mode , and the fermionic @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes , that hold the cards .",
    "both the atlas and cms experiments have updated  @xcite their results at the high energy collider conference held november 2012 in kyoto .",
    "however , the updates were uneven in the amount of data used .",
    "most critically , neither experiments updated the @xmath0 result , while the atlas experiment also did not update the @xmath10 mode .",
    "the cms update for both the @xmath11 and @xmath10 modes are consistent with sm expectation , but the slightly more sensitive ( to @xmath12 ratio of measured @xmath13 vs sm ) @xmath11 gives @xmath14 by more than one sigma . for atlas ,",
    "the @xmath11 mode was only updated with 2012 data , giving a result similar to the july result .",
    "the @xmath15 value seems slightly above 1 . for the fermionic final states , unlike the absence of any hint for @xmath8 or @xmath9 in july , the cms experiment now sees consistency with @xmath16 , i.e. sm expectation .",
    "it is now the atlas experiment , with equivalent amount of data as cms , that seems to drag a little : there is no hint of any signal in @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is consistent with both sm expection as well as no signal . to summarize ,",
    "as far as one awaits the @xmath0 update , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes are not settled  @xcite , even though things do move towards the sm higgs . since up to",
    "17 to 18 fb@xmath17 data has been used , while a total of @xmath18 fb@xmath17 is expected for each experiment , it seems that the fermionic modes can not be established with 2011 - 2012 data .",
    "thus , even though it may appear more and more like the sm higgs boson , the dilaton case probably can not be thrown away offhandedly . in a general theoretical context",
    "@xcite , it may not be easy to keep a dilaton much lighter than the scale invariance violation scale . however , a 126 gev ",
    "dilaton \" would likely remain experimentally allowed . in this sense , the achilles heel to the sm higgs interpretation would be the width of the observed particle , which probably can not be measured at the lhc ; we probably would not know for decades .",
    "the dilaton width is expected to be @xmath19 suppressed with respect to the higgs width .",
    "having elucidated the fact that the sm - higgs nature of the observed boson can not be fully established , and conversely the dilaton possibility can not be firmly ruled out , in this paper we wish to explore a scenario of strong - coupling driven dynamical symmetry breaking ( dsb ) that allows for the dilaton . assuming the actual higgs boson is very heavy or",
    "does nt even exist , let us check what is the firm experimental knowledge .",
    "the higgs mechanism is an experimental fact .",
    "that is , the electroweak ( ew ) gauge symmetry is experimentally established , while the gauge bosons , as well as the chirally charged fermions , are all found to be massive .",
    "thus , the goldstone particle of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is  eaten \" by the ew gauge bosons , which become massive ( the meissner effect ) , as has been experimentally established since 30 years .    with both quarks and gauge bosons massive , without invoking the higgs boson explicitly",
    ", one can see heuristically  @xcite that , starting from the left - handed gauge coupling , the longitudinal component of the ew gauge bosons , i.e. equivalently the goldstone bosons , couple to quarks by the standard yukawa coupling .",
    "thus , yukawa couplings are experimentally established .",
    "furthermore  @xcite , much of flavor physics and @xmath20 violation studies probe the effects of yukawa couplings , providing ample support for their existence .    -0.3 cm   -5.1 cm    with the existence of three quark generations already , interest  @xcite has been growing in the fourth generation in the past few years , as the lhc opens up new horizons .",
    "of course , an sm higgs interpretation of the 126 gev boson deflates one s faith in the 4th generation .",
    "however , with our assumption of a heavy higgs boson while taking the 126 gev boson as the dilaton , the 4th generation remains a viable possibility .",
    "the pursuit has indeed been vigorous at the lhc in the past few years , where the current bound  @xcite on @xmath21 has reached beyond 600 gev ( we shall assume  heavy isospin \" symmetry , @xmath22 , and treat the doublet @xmath2 as degenerate ) .",
    "this is already above the nominal perturbative partial wave unitarity bound ( ub ) of 550 gev  @xcite .",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath23 is more than 3.5 times larger than @xmath24 , and has entered the strong coupling regime ( @xmath25 ) .    with the ever increasing bound on @xmath21 , it may well not exist .",
    "but being beyond ub , it begs the question : could the",
    "_ strong yukawa coupling _ of @xmath2 generate  @xcite ewsb itself ? along this line , a gap equation , given symbolically in fig .  1 ,",
    "was constructed  @xcite without ever invoking the higgs doublet , or the higgs boson field .",
    "the logic , or philosophy goes as follows .",
    "the goldstone boson @xmath3 is viewed as a tightly bound ( by yukawa coupling itself ! ) @xmath26 state .",
    "it was in fact _ postulated _",
    "@xcite as the collapsed state by yukawa binding , as seen through a bethe  salpeter equation study  @xcite ( for further elucidation , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is taken as suggestive of triggering ewsb itself . with no new physics in sight at the lhc ,",
    "not even the heavy chiral quark @xmath2 itself , the loop momentum integration runs up to roughly @xmath27 , without the need to add any further effects ( with the simplification of ignoring , or truncating , corrections to @xmath3 propagation and @xmath28 vertex ) .",
    "this is therefore a  bootstrap \" gap equation , in that the strong yukawa coupling itself is the source of ewsb , or mass generation for quark @xmath2 , which simultaneously justifies keeping the goldstone @xmath3 in the loop .",
    "the _ existence _ of a large yukawa coupling @xmath4 is used as input , _ without a theory _ for @xmath4 itself .",
    "the question now is whether one could find a solution to such a gap equation .",
    "if so , we would have demonstrated the case for dsb , and the potential riches that could follow .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to formulate more clearly the gap equation , and demonstrate that numerical solution does exist at strong coupling .",
    "a similar gap equation was formulated by hung and xiong  @xcite , where @xmath3 in fig .",
    "1 is replaced by a massless higgs doublet field .",
    "we will compare and offer a critique .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , after briefly mentioning the nambu  jona - lasinio model , which is a simplified template for dsb where the self - energy is momentum - independent , we focus on the more relevant strongly - coupled scale - invariant qed , which we utilize as a means of setting up our approach . in sec .",
    "iii , we formulate our bootstrap gap equation following the setup in sec .",
    "ii , and solve numerically for the critical @xmath4 ( hence @xmath21 ) .",
    "we compare with a similar study by hung and xiong , and pursue the consequence of taking the physical loop cutoff to be less than @xmath27 , and outline the framework for further study . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the many questions and issues of dsb related to our bootstrap equation , including the issue of the dilaton .",
    "our conclusion is given in sec .",
    "in this section we briefly review the nambu  jona - lasinio model , where one sets up a gap equation with its well - known solution .",
    "we then turn to the so - called strongly - coupled scale - invariant qed , which is closer to our gap equation . by recounting some major steps",
    ", we also set up our notation for later usage .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio model  @xcite , proposed in 1960 , is the earliest , explicit model of dsb , where the breaking of global chiral symmetry leads to generation of nucleon mass , and the pion as a ( pseudo-)goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "-5 cm    the model can be depicted as in fig .  2 , where a four - fermion interaction is introduced , represented by the blob on the right - hand side .",
    "the nucleon mass , represented by a cross , is self - consistently generated .",
    "one easily finds the gap equation @xmath29 where @xmath3 here is the four - fermi coupling and @xmath30 is the cutoff . since @xmath31 on both sides factor out",
    ", one has @xmath32 which admits a solution for @xmath33 , where @xmath34    to understand what is happening , one can iterate the cross of the left - hand side of fig .  2 on the right - hand side , and sees that it contain an infinite number of diagrams .",
    "this effectively puts the original self - energy diagram into the denominator , and in the end , one trades the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath30 for the physical @xmath31 and the pion - nucleon coupling . at the more refined level and using the quark language , one can show further that the emergent goldstone boson , the pion , is in fact a ladder sum of the quark - level four - fermi interaction .",
    "we will return at the end to discuss the similarity and differences of the njl model with our gap equation .",
    "we note that the self - energy bubble of fig .",
    "2 does not depend on external momentum @xmath35 , so at the superficial level , fig .",
    "2 is quite different from fig .  1 .",
    "we now turn to qed , where there is closer similarity .",
    "the general gap equation for qed  @xcite can be written in the form of the schwinger ",
    "dyson ( sd ) equation , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electron self - energy with @xmath38 the electron ( full ) propagator , @xmath39 is the photon ( full ) propagator , and @xmath40 is the full vertex .      truncating the exact , full vertex and photon propagator by the approximation , @xmath41 which is called the ladder ( or rainbow ) approximation , the gap equation becomes @xmath42 with @xmath39 given in eq .",
    "( [ dmunu ] ) , and we have set @xmath43 , i.e. massless qed ( at lagrangian level ) .",
    "pictorially , this is represented as in fig .",
    "the question now is whether the scale invariance could be dynamically broken at some strong coupling @xmath44 ?",

    "our aim is therefore solving @xmath46 and @xmath49 from the gap equation of eq .",
    "( [ gapqed ] ) . inserting eq .",
    "( [ dmunu ] ) and after some algebra , one finds @xmath50 and @xmath51      simplification can be achieved in landau gauge , @xmath52 , where one finds @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath46 is the inverse of wave function renormalization , this means that it satisfies ward - takahashi identity even under the ladder approximation .",

    "the integral equation can be changed to a differential equation by noting @xmath60 one obtains the differential equation , @xmath61 together with the boundary conditions ( b.c . ) for ir and uv , which are given as @xmath62 if ir cutoff is 0 , the b.c . for ir should be replaced by @xmath63 at @xmath64 .",
    "in order to study qualitative features , let us find first an approximate solution .",
    "in particular , for the special range for the ir cutoff , let us take @xmath65 , then eq .",

    "namely , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is a hypergeometric function . checking the asymptotic behavior for @xmath91 , the power behavior for @xmath71 can not satisfy the uv boundary condition .",
    "the gap equation has a nontrivial or oscillatory solution for @xmath70 , where the critical coupling is @xmath72 for qed .",
    "the dynamical effective mass is obtained by solving @xmath92 .",
    "note that the pole of the propagator should be given in the time - like region , so one has to make analytical continuation in order to obtain a physical mass , which can be done smoothly for @xmath93 .",
    "an issue arises in that the dynamical mass @xmath94 is proportional to the uv cutoff @xmath30 . for @xmath95 to be physical , however",
    ", it should not depend on @xmath30 .",
    "miransky suggested  @xcite that @xmath81 as @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 is a nontrivial uv fixed point .",
    "a related issue , which we would not go into , is whether there would be a dilaton associated with breaking of scale invariance  @xcite .",

    "kugo approach of the previous section . in landau",

    "after all , one is invoking large yukawa couplings , which feed the notorious divergent quadratic corrections to the higgs boson mass .",
    "the one - loop two - point and four - point functions with quark @xmath2 in the loop would generate effective @xmath178 and @xmath179 self - coupling terms for the higgs field . with no explicit dynamical principle ( such as gauge invariance for the case of qed ) , the assumption of a _",
    "higgs doublet as the agent of dsb is not only _ ad hoc _ , but clearly unsustainable .",
    "in contrast , we see the merit , as well as the meaning , of our  bootstrap \" gap equation .",
    "so long we are in the broken phase , there is a massless goldstone boson , which couples with the known yukawa coupling . treating the yukawa coupling as large , if a nontrivial solution to the gap equation is found ( as we have illustrated above ) , it in turn justifies the use of a massless goldstone boson in the gap equation .",
    "in fact , the physical argument  @xcite was to view the goldstone boson @xmath3 as an extremely tight ultrarelativistic bound state of heavy @xmath2 and @xmath180 from the broken phase , while @xmath3 enters the  bootstrap \" gap equation to dynamically generate @xmath21 hence break the symmetry , and in same stroke justify its own existence .    from the argument above",
    ", we see that our bootstrap gap equation puts the existence of the physical higgs boson in doubt .",
    "after all , it is rather difficult to keep a light physical higgs boson , in the presence of much stronger yukawa couplings than the top quark . for our gap equation ,",
    "one also can not ignore corrections to the higgs propagator . at the foundation level  @xcite , unlike the goldstone boson , even though a 126 gev higgs - like boson has appeared , its true nature has to be settled by experiment .",
    "our numerical study also shows that keeping the higgs term tends to raise the critical yukawa coupling considerably , implying @xmath27 higher than the lhc collision energy .",
    "thus , in the name of simplicity and pertinence , we drop the @xmath181 case from now on .",
    "however , we shall return at the end to discuss the dilaton issue .",
    "the previous comparison with hung - xiong approach , and in particular the bootstrap nature of the goldstone boson @xmath3 in the gap equation , illustrates that the limit @xmath163 would take us outside the range of validity of the gap equation itself .",
    "it is clear that , for timelike @xmath183 , there is no goldstone boson .",
    "thus , for the cutoff @xmath30 , one should not use the traditional language of @xmath184 , and one probably should not contemplate  uv - completion \" at the current stage .",
    "the bootstrap gap equation does not provide a _ theory _ of the heavy quark yukawa coupling @xmath4 , but employs it for dsb .",
    "thus , we suggest a cutoff @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is some true new physics scale where the origin of yukawa couplings may be contemplated , but it is out of reach for now",
    ".    another possible interpretation of this cutoff is related to the restoration of symmetry .",
    "the goldstone boson couples to broken currents , but the @xmath173 factor of the goldstone boson may vanish at some scale related to the scale where the goldstone boson becomes unbounded , and symmetry is restored . rather than a true @xmath184 that in principle extends to infinity , there exists a cutoff @xmath30 of the gap equation .",
    "we are in effect summing over the goldstone boson correction to the self - energy of the quark @xmath2 , when the goldstone boson is still defined . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this picture does receive experimental support , in that no new physics seem to be there below @xmath187 tev scale .",
    "so , one sums up only the effect of the goldstone boson , and nothing else .",
    "0.4 cm   is in units of the dynamical quark mass @xmath140.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] 0.3 cm    the gap equation sums up the effect , from low to high momentum , of the correction by the goldstone boson @xmath3 to the quark self - energy .",
    "( [ lamcr_infty ] ) reflects taking this sum to @xmath163 .",
    "since the summation is accumulative , if now one sums only to some @xmath188 , as we have argued , then the cumulative effect is less than summing to very large momentum above @xmath27 .",
    "we note that @xmath27 is a physical scale parameter that is external to the scale - invariant gap equation .",
    "nevertheless , we can plot the dependence of @xmath176 on the cutoff @xmath30 . from fig .",
    "[ lamlam ] , one can see that , for a lower cutoff , @xmath176 has to be higher than in eq .",
    "( [ lamcr_infty ] ) .",
    "this is because , as the integration range is smaller , a larger @xmath4 value is needed to compensate .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ lamcr_infty ] ) gives a lower bound on @xmath21 . if we take @xmath189 , then @xmath190 , and @xmath191 which is very high .",
    "we will return to discuss whether this could be an overestimate later .      up to now",
    ", we have been cavalier in the relation between @xmath176 and @xmath192 , treating it as @xmath193 .",
    "but @xmath6 is a physically measured value , and @xmath21 is yet to be experimentally measured . if electroweak symmetry is indeed dynamically broken by the large yukawa coupling of a new heavy chiral quark @xmath2 , when @xmath2 is discovered in the future , likely @xmath194 .",
    "we then see that the actual v.e.v .",
    "value , @xmath6 , may not correspond to the critical value @xmath176 .",
    "this brings about the question of how scale invariance is actually broken in our gap equations , and whether there might be a dilaton  @xcite .",
    "this is an extremely interesting question , given the possibility , needed for the viability of our gap equation , that the observed 126 gev higgs - like boson might actually be a dilaton .",
    "our framework , however , does not provide the means to approach this problem , as it is empirical and shuns the uv .    rather than approach this deeper problem , we try to obtain the decay constant @xmath195 of the goldstone boson , which should be the same as the vacuum expectation value , @xmath6 . following the pagels  stokar formula  @xcite naively , we obtain , @xmath196 more generally , we write @xmath197 \\nonumber \\\\ %   & = & m_q^2 \\int_0^{\\lambda^2/m_q^2 } d\\hat x \\hat{\\cal f } [ a(\\hat x ) , b(\\hat x)/a(\\hat x)/m_q ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath198 , and we have scaled by @xmath21 ( and redefined the function @xmath199 ) , treating it as physical .",
    "we can get back the ",

    "therefore , solving the gap equation , we obtain a prediction for the heavy quark mass .",
    "but technical issues remain : is @xmath21 a physical mass ?",

    "( [ mqcr_infty ] ) , seem depressingly high .",
    "we offer a few remarks how this might be lowered . in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the goldstone boson @xmath3 is the lowest or most tightly bound state through the yukawa coupling itself .",
    "yukawa - bound resonances exist above this isotriplet , color - singlet , pseudoscalar state , the leading ones being the isotriplet , pseudoscalar @xmath208 , the isosinglet , vector @xmath209 , which are both color - octet , and the isosinglet , vector , color - singlet @xmath210  mesons \" . without solving the strongly coupled bound state problem",
    ", one does not know the spectrum ( i.e. how tightly they are bound below @xmath27 ) , nor their  decay constants \" , i.e. how they couple to the heavy quark @xmath2 .",
    "but the couplings should be rather strong .",
    "the point is , as one integrates the goldstone loop up to @xmath27 , at some point these heavy mesons should also enter , and contribute in the same spirit to the self - energy of @xmath2 .",
    "there is thus some hope that extra , attractive contributions could lower @xmath176 .",
    "but it also illustrates the limits of our bootstrap approach .",
    "the momentum integration for these extra contributions start from the meson mass , up to @xmath27 , but clearly the meson propagators and the meson-@xmath211 vertices would be much more sensitive to @xmath212 as it varies , compared to the goldstone boson @xmath3 . even for @xmath3 ( which is the @xmath213 ) , as one approaches @xmath27 , its bound state nature would lead to modifications of its propagator ( even if symmetry remains broken hence it remains massless ) and vertex .    0.2 cm  _ @xmath206 self - consistency with dilaton _ 0.1 cm    we have already offered our critique of the work of hung and xiong  @xcite , and showed also numerically that the needed @xmath176 is exorbitantly high if one includes a light sm higgs .",
    "thus , if the new 126 gev boson is found to be truly the sm higgs , our bootstrap dsb gap equation can not work .",
    "however , we have argued that the nature of the new boson probably can not be demonstrated beyond doubt with 2011 - 2012 lhc data , and a loophole is the dilaton  @xcite .",
    "the dilaton is allowed by our gap equation , since the dsb also breaks scale invariance .    at the operational level",
    ", one can easily see that , if the observed 126 gev object is a dilaton , it does not change the main result of our study .",
    "that is , given that the dilaton coupling is suppressed by @xmath5 compared to the sm higgs boson , where @xmath7 is the dilaton decay constant , the @xmath166-dependent terms of eqs .",
    "( [ bp2 ] ) and ( [ p2ap2 ] ) are suppressed by @xmath19 , and can be treated as subdominant hence dropped , in the same spirit that the strong and weak gauge couplings are treated as subdominant",
    ".    0.2 cm  _ @xmath206 comparison with njl - type models _ 0.1 cm    a different question is whether our gap equation is actually equivalent to the njl model .",
    "we have already commented that for the njl model , the self - energy does not depend on momentum , and one simply cuts the loop momentum off at some @xmath30 . for our gap equation ,",
    "the wave function part , @xmath46 , has momentum dependence , i.e. the yukawa loop always modifies the @xmath173 factor .",
    "we already saw this in scale - invariant qed .",
    "for njl , the cutoff @xmath30 is traded , together with the associated dimension @xmath214 coupling constant @xmath3 , for the physical @xmath215 and @xmath31 , although , depending on the cutoff , there is a critical coupling @xmath216 ( see eq .  ( [ gcrit ] ) ) . for our case",
    ", one can not take arbitrary values for the cutoff .",
    "instead , we argued that , because the goldstone boson would become unbounded at some scale , say @xmath27 , the cutoff of the loop momentum has to be  heuristically \" finite .",
    "further similarities and differences are noted in ref .",
    "a fundamental difference may be that one has effectively postulated that the dimension zero yukawa coupling of the goldstone boson to be the experimentally verified one related to the left - handed vector gauge coupling of massive quarks . if the goldstone boson @xmath3 is an ultratight @xmath26 bound state , it has turned the effective @xmath26 dimensionality to 1 . in this sense , our gap equation may resemble the gauged njl model @xcite , in which the dimensionality of the bound state tends to 1 near the critical gauge coupling .",
    "our approach is also conceptually different from those descended from the top condensation model  @xcite , in which the gauged njl is applied to ewsb .",
    "the self - energy in the top condensation model incorporates both our fig .  2 ( loop with four - quark operator ) and fig .",
    "3 ( but with gauge boson in the loop ) .",
    "the gap equation with the four - quark operator is equivalent to the minimization of the linear sigma model with a compositeness condition , such that the yukawa and higgs quartic couplings blow up at the composite scale . naively speaking , our gap equation of fig .",
    "4 corresponds to the linear sigma model with large yukawa coupling .",
    "one can therefore read off the schematic correspondence between top condensation and our approach by replacing gauge coupling with yukawa coupling , and four - quark operator loop by possible heavy bound state loop that we have discussed earlier . in the top condensation model ,",
    "the four - quark interaction generates the large yukawa coupling , and thus , it is clear that it differs from our approach .",
    "we did not touch the origins of yukawa couplings at all .",
    "0.2 cm  _ @xmath206 phenomenology at lhc ? _ 0.1 cm    can our high quark mass of a couple of tev , with the associated ultra strong yukawa coupling , be testable at the lhc ? first , as we mentioned already , with this setup , it is very hard to believe that there would be a light higgs at 126 gev , hence the observed new boson ought to be a dilaton  @xcite , which can be checked experimentally .",
    "furthermore , one expects a heavy higss @xmath217 gev , and the search for heavy higgs boson should continue to be pursued .    but",
    "even though there may be scalar resonances , experience from hadronic physics ( the @xmath218 resonance ) suggest that this path may be rather murky .",
    "so , besides the current search approach that assumes qcd pair production of @xmath26 , followed by free quark @xmath2 decay , what else might one do at the lhc ?",
    "after all , 2 or 3 tev heavy quarks are approaching the searchable limits even for the high luminosity lhc running at 14 tev .",
    "it was pointed out recently by one of us  @xcite , making analogy with @xmath219 annihilation , that the search strategy should contain @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is nothing but the goldstone bosons @xmath3 of the electroweak sector .",
    "it was argued that the multiplicity would be high , and behave as thermal emission from a  fireball \" with temperature @xmath222 that is related to the v.e.v .",
    "scale @xmath6 .",
    "if the bound states , especially @xmath209 , decay in a similar way via multi-@xmath221 , then there is good hope for such spectacular phenomena at the lhc .",
    "a corollary  @xcite is that the @xmath223 channel may be the wrong path for going beyond heavy higgs search , but it rather should be @xmath224 .",
    "what is intriguing is that the physically measured @xmath225 coupling is consistent with @xmath226 , and is rather similar in value to eq .",
    "( [ lamcr_infty ] ) .",
    "this offers a totally separate argument , hence giving confidence , that @xmath21 is in fact of order 2 tev or above .",
    "0.2 cm  _ @xmath206 revisiting fermi  yang model _ 0.1 cm    having made the analogy of @xmath3-@xmath2 with @xmath227-@xmath228 , it brings back the question of whether the pion could really have been an @xmath229 bound state , i.e. whether the original conjecture of fermi and yang  @xcite , could have been realized .",
    "the strength of @xmath230 coupling is simply staggering .",
    "but subsequent developments in hadron physics experiment relatively quickly gave rise to meson states in 500 to 800 mev range ( and corresponding baryon resonances ) , eventually exploding , in 1 to 2 gev range , i.e. below @xmath231 .",
    "thus , our gap equation does not apply .",
    "even if one employed our gap equation , one can not integrate the pion loop up to @xmath231 : the integral is cutoff at a scale @xmath232 that is quite below @xmath231 . and",
    "it turned out that @xmath227 and @xmath228 were qcd bound states of fermi size , so the pion was not an ultratight bound state of @xmath228 and @xmath233 .",
    "but the possible existence of a very heavy chiral doublet offers us another chance .",
    "if the @xmath26 ultratight bound state picture for the goldstone @xmath3 could be realized according to our bootstrap gap equation , it would strengthen our reasoning  @xcite that the underlying theory for yukawa couplings can not be a simple mock - up of qcd , such as ( the various forms of ) technicolor ( tc ) .",
    "we do not have new insight on bound state phenomena , other than what is already discussed in ref .",
    "unfortunately , this reference was very conservative and did not discuss above @xmath234 gev , as the bethe  salpeter ( bs ) equation approach tend to have collapsed states .",
    "but this was , in turn , the foundation for the postulate made in ref .",
    "@xcite that the leading collapsed state , @xmath213 , is precisely the goldstone boson @xmath3 , which lead to the present gap equation study .",
    "we do not yet know whether our gap equation could shed any light on the @xmath26 bound state spectra .",
    "the sd equation itself is of course a  higher level \" one than the bs equation for bound state .",
    "if the bs equation yukawa - boundstate approach can be a guide for @xmath21 as high as 2 tev , i.e. with @xmath235 , the noteworthy point is that the leading bound states  @xcite @xmath210 , @xmath209 and @xmath208 are rather distinct from the @xmath236s and @xmath237s of tc .",
    "since @xmath236-like states are the typical working assumption for dsb that tends to adopt the qcd or tc mindset , we wish to stress this distinguishing aspect of yukawa - induced dsb .",
    "0.2 cm  _ @xmath206 question of flavor vs ewsb _ 0.1 cm    bound states in our approach emerge from strong yukawa coupling ( rather than qcd - like gauge dynamics as in tc ) , but we did not offer any theory of yukawa couplings .",
    "this may be an advantage : by simply employing yukawa couplings , we inherit this well tested part of the sm , including the flavor sector .",
    "the three generation sm can account for all observed flavor and cp violation phenomena , with only minor tensions after a decade of detailed scrutiny by the b factories .",
    "note that the higgs boson does not enter flavor processes of interest , such as box and electroweak penguin diagrams ; all interesting effects arise from goldstone couplings . extending to a 4th generation to address ewsb by strong yukawa coupling",
    ", we will not encounter the usual issues of  flavor scale \" as in most other approaches . mixing of the 4th generation with lower ones must be suppressed , as the lhcb experiment finds all key measurements , such as cp phase in @xmath238 , @xmath239 in @xmath240 , as well as @xmath241 are all consistent with sm .",
    "but this follows the well known pattern that ckm matrix elements trickle down in strength as one goes far off - diagonal .",
    "we do note that , having a 4th generation could seemingly provide enough cp violation strength  @xcite for matter dominance of the universe , which can be viewed as an independent motivation for continuing to entertain the 4th generation .",
    "thus , unlike most approaches that suffer the dilemma of need for tev scale physics to  stabilize the higgs \" ( or ewsb ) on one hand , while having a much higher flavor scale , in our case , the flavor physics scale need not be that far off .",
    "if realized , the actual origins of yukawa couplings would become the focus question .",
    "we mention in passing that our gap equation can be easily extended to finite temperature , allowing one to potentially explore issues related to electroweak phase transition , which is a direction that we would take up in a subsequent work .",
    "despite the emergence of a higgs - like new boson with mass of order 126 gev at the lhc , we have inspected current data up to 1718 fb@xmath17 level , and concluded that a dilaton interpretation can not be fully ruled out , even if it appears fortuitous . assuming this state as a dilaton that feigns ( for now ) the sm higgs boson , while the actual higgs boson is above 600 gev and heavy , we consider seriously the possibility of electroweak symmetry breaking driven by strong yukawa coupling .",
    "starting from a purely empirical basis , a dynamical gap equation is argued , treating the goldstone as massless inside the loop , coupling with chiral quark doublet @xmath2 with the usual yukawa couplings . by empirical",
    "we mean the traditional sense of based on experimentally established facts , where we have utilized electroweak gauge symmetry and its spontaneously broken nature , only extending by a new chiral doublet @xmath2  the 4th generation  with yukawa coupling @xmath4 already above the nominal unitarity bound , which is again empirical .",
    "the gap equation effectively sums over exchange momentum of @xmath26 scattering .",
    "we further utilize the experimental fact that there are no obvious new states below 1 or 2 tev , hence this integration range can extend up to  @xmath27 \" without any further significant contributions , while @xmath21 is to be determined by solving this dynamical equation .",
    "this is done by drawing experience from strongly coupled , massless ( hence scale invariant ) qed . unlike qed , where choosing the landau gauge leads to simplification , in the present case one needs to face a coupled integral equation .",
    "numerical solutions are found , hence dynamical ewsb demonstrated , at the cost of staggeringly high quark mass @xmath21 in the 23 tev range .",
    "though rather high in value , lhc might still shed light on it , as the critical @xmath242 turns out analogous to the @xmath227@xmath228 system , which provides some justification .",
    "it also suggests , by analogy , the possible novel phenomenon of multi-@xmath3 , or multi-@xmath221 production at 14 tev lhc .",
    "we have already stated our preference for the heavy or  no higgs \" ( not the same as higgsless ) scenario . however , in its stead the existence of @xmath26 mesons in the form of color octet @xmath208 and @xmath209 , and color singlet @xmath210 are implied , where the notation is under a heavy isospin @xmath22 .",
    "it is interesting that a dilaton is _ allowed _ by our gap equation , which is nominally scale invariant , while our dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking solution also breaks this scale invariance .",
    "but the actual source of this scale invariance violation is likely rooted in the dynamical origins , at a considerably higher uv scale , of @xmath4 , which was only treated as a parameter in our present work .",
    "the lhc could establish the dilaton nature of the 126 gev boson , if it is confirmed that vector boson fusion ( vbf ) and higgsstralung ( vh ) production processes are indeed suppressed . measuring this suppression factor",
    "would tell us the dilaton scale , or decay constant @xmath7 , while the 126 gev mass would be a  messenger \" from higher uv theory of the actual scale invariance violation .",
    "thus , if a dilaton emerges , and our dynamical equation is confirmed in some form , it is certainly no less exciting than the discovery of the sm higgs itself .",
