    "wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) @xcite have made sufficiently great attention in the field of signal processing and wireless communications .",
    "sensor nodes are made up of mems @xcite , @xcite and smaller in size having low processing speed , generally used for sensing and extracting data in a network .",
    "wsn are used in military applications , under water @xcite , environmental monitoring @xcite , health care applications and many more .",
    "sensor nodes are capable to measure an event features ( like temperature , pressure , humidity , etc . ) . in wsn ,",
    "a group of sensor nodes perform similar sensing task of an event features ( like measuring moisture content of agricultural field , reading temperature of an indoor room , measuring seismic event , detecting event target , detecting fire in a forest etc ) .",
    "an event is defined as a physical occurrence which is measured by groups of sensor nodes in a network .",
    "sensor nodes continuously measure the physical phenomenon of an event and report measured information to the sink node .",
    "sensor nodes does collaborative sensing task in two dimensional @xcite-@xcite networks , where nodes are deployed in agricultural field , forest , etc .",
    "however , wsn can also be applied in three dimensional @xcite-@xcite space by measuring movement and behavior of birds or insects and fixing sensor nodes with probes in underwater @xcite .",
    "the information collected by sensor nodes deployed in three dimensional space are generally spatially correlated within a network .",
    "sensor node uses correlated information to form clusters . in a 3d clusters based sensing model @xcite , the sensing range of a cluster",
    "is considered as sphere . since",
    "the sensing range of clusters are spherical , it creates tessellate ( overlapping or gapping ) of sensing coverage as shown in figure 1 . in this figure ,",
    "three clusters are given namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 respectively .",
    "each cluster have its own neighboring nodes within its spherical sensing range .",
    "as shown in figure , cluster a and b respectively overlaps in its spherical range which leads to increase the bandwidth utilization in 3d network .",
    "moreover , in between cluster s @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , there is a gap ( tessellate ) among spherical sensing range which leads to poor sensing coverage in 3d networks .",
    "the assessment of information is a major issue in 3d - wsn as sensor nodes have a limitation of having low processing power and have sort communication range .",
    "based upon the statistical knowledge of data @xcite , sensor node extract data ( with prior knowledge or without prior knowledge of data statistics ) from the environment , process it and finally transmits to the base station ( bs ) . while extracting data , in some cases sensor networks assume that they have prior knowledge of data statistics ( like variance and covariance of sensed data ) in the network .",
    "but most often , sensor nodes extract data in a regular interval of time without having prior knowledge of data statistics .",
    "thus , sensor nodes extract statistical information from the environment under two scenarios .",
    "firstly , sensor nodes extract information within a network under priori knowledge of statistical information ( e.g variance and covariance ) of the environment .",
    "for example , sensor networks have prior knowledge of variance and covariance of temperature of an indoor room . in wsn",
    ", extracting information without having prior knowledge of information statistics is a challenging task in three dimensional space .",
    "hence , in this paper , we focus on extracting information in 3d space without having prior knowledge of signal statistics . here , sensor nodes observe and sense information dynamically and transmit it to ch node or base station .",
    "real time sensor data is monitored continuously over temporal and spatial @xcite domains , respectively .",
    "the information extracted by sensor nodes are generally spatially correlated within a network . as the node density increases , the spatially proximal @xcite , @xcite observation of correlated information among the nodes also increases in 3d - wsn . since , spatial information received at the sink node are highly correlated , it increases information redundancy in the network .",
    "hence , it is required to minimized information redundancy in wsns . moreover , in each cluster , cluster head ( ch ) node calculates a distortion factor @xcite-@xcite ( information accuracy ) in 3d space .",
    "distortion factor or information accuracy @xcite is defined as the degree of closeness of measured data to its actual sensed data in a network .",
    "data accuracy @xcite-@xcite models are developed under spatial data correlation .",
    "these models calculates a minimum set of sensor nodes which are sufficient to give the desired data accuracy level as achieved by the whole network .",
    "data accuracy can be model under online @xcite data extraction to select optimal sensor nodes in the network .",
    "generally , information accuracy is maximized to get accurate information but leads to increase in energy consumption in the network . to balance these",
    ", a trade off @xcite between information accuracy and energy consumption is built to increase the lifetime of sensor networks .",
    "it also selects an optimal sensor nodes , thereby reducing the communication overhead in the network .    in figure 2 ,",
    "a 3d space is considered having three coordinates where we are interested to measure the information profile of each sensor node . in this 3d space",
    "lets assuming ten sensor nodes are deployed randomly .",
    "out of ten sensor nodes , lets say six sensor nodes have reached the desired maximum information level .",
    "hence node number : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are considered in the network to maximize the information accuracy .",
    "the sensor nodes with bellow of that desired information level may have lower information profile .",
    "in reality , it may be possible that node i d : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are directly put under the sunlight , due to which the signal variance goes above the desired information accuracy level , where as node i d : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are placed under the shade of a tree .",
    "this may be the reason due to which the signal variance of the sensor nodes are bellow that desired information accuracy level of that specific location .",
    "hence , it may be recommended that nodes with lower information profile in that specific location are added with extra deployed sensor nodes so that a desirable information accuracy can be extracted on that specific location .        to extract accurate information , nodes deployment in 3d - space plays a crucial role in wireless sensor networks .",
    "sensor nodes can be deployed in two ways : ( a ) it can be deterministically deployed by manually putting it in the sensing field by human effort . but these type of nodes deployment is inefficient in terms of time and cost .",
    "( b ) it can be randomly deployed in the sensing field by aerial or human effort . but both the procedure , we are not aware of extracting maximum information in a specific location due to exact placement of sensor nodes in 3d wireless sensor networks",
    ". therefore , placement of sensor nodes plays a vital role in terms of maximizing the information accuracy with node placement strategy in wireless sensor networks . in this paper , we consider the application of environmental monitoring to measure temperature data in 3d - wsn .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss the related works . in section iii , we have addressed the problem definitions of our work . in section iv , we describe the mathematical models of 3d - dc , 3d - ie and 3d - np algorithms respectively .",
    "validations and simulations of the propose work are presented in section v. finally , we conclude our work in section vi .",
    "in @xcite , author s proposed the confident information coverage model where sensor nodes are deployed such that they cover the entire geographical area in wireless sensor networks . in @xcite ,",
    "author s proposed an optimal node placement patterns based on confident information coverage ( cic ) considering the collaboration of sensor information and spatial correlation of physical data . in @xcite , author s",
    "investigate optimal node placement for long belt coverage in wireless sensor networks .",
    "moreover , in @xcite-@xcite , authors discussed the information coverage problem implemented in two dimensional wireless sensor networks , but none of the above works illustrate the information coverage problem in three dimensional networks , which is still a open challenge in communication networks .",
    "the above literatures , also havent addressed the information coverage problem , in three dimensional distributed scenario .",
    "however , many clustering algorithms @xcite-@xcite are proposed for wsn in two dimensional space . but none of the work addresses the formation of clusters using jointly sensing nodes in 3d space . in @xcite , a 3d spherical based sensing model is proposed , but the model creates tessellate ( overlapping or gapping ) in between the spherical ranges which utilizes more bandwidth in the network . however , in @xcite authors addressed the problem to model the sensing coverage by tessellating polyhedra but lags the formation of cluster in 3d - wsn . moreover ,",
    "various data estimation models @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , are developed with _ a - prior _ knowledge of data statistics in two dimensional space and three dimensional space , but none of the works focus on estimating information without having _ a - priori _ knowledge of information statistics in 3d - wsn . in @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "data accuracy models are developed under spatial data correlation .",
    "these models calculates a minimum set of sensor nodes which are sufficient to give the desired data accuracy level as achieved by the whole network .",
    "similarly , in @xcite , @xcite data accuracy model is developed under online data extraction to select optimal sensor nodes in the network . in @xcite",
    ", a trade off between data accuracy and energy consumption is developed to select an optimal number of sensor nodes , thereby reducing the communication overhead in the network . but",
    "none of the works have determine which sensor nodes are to be selected for achieving maximum information accuracy in the network . in the above literature ,",
    "sensor nodes are either deterministically or randomly deployed in the sensing field to find an optimal set of sensor nodes maintaining a desired information accuracy level .",
    "therefore , it also does nt explore which sensor nodes are to be selected .",
    "moreover , it does nt clarifies where exactly is to be place sensor nodes in 3d - space to get maximum information accuracy .",
    "in this section , we emphasize to formulate our problem definitions as follows .    _",
    "1 . formation of distributed clusters using dodecahedran topology for better sensing coverage is a subject of interest in 3d - wsn _ : in 3d - wsn , sensing coverage of clusters are generally modelled as spherical topology . but spherical range of clusters form tessellate ( overlapping or gaping ) space within clusters .",
    "this lead to poor sensing coverage ( due to space among spherical range of cluster ) or more bandwidth utilization ( due to overlapping of spherical range of clusters ) in 3d - wsn",
    ". moreover deployment of more nodes in the sensing range creates unnecessary data redundancy in 3d - wsn due to spatially correlated data . to overcome this problem",
    ", we develop three dimensional distributed clustering ( 3d - dc ) algorithm using dodecahedron topology as shown in figure 3 . in this figure , three clusters namely @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are shown with dodecahedron topology .",
    "each dodecahedron clusters has its own neighboring sensor nodes within its range .",
    "as shown in figure , there may not have tessellate between the clusters which reduce the information redundancy in 3d networks .",
    "information estimation without having priori knowledge of signal statistics ( i.e online information estimation ) is a challenging task in 3d - wsn : _ sensor nodes form distributed clusters in two dimensional space and three dimensional space using spatially correlated data among sensor nodes .",
    "data correlation among sensor nodes have both priori and without priori information statistics ( i.e known and unknown variance or covariance ) in the network . using the knowledge of information statistics , information estimation models are developed in two dimensional wsn .",
    "moreover , information estimation with prior knowledge of signal statistics is implemented in 3d - wsn but non of the work emphasize on estimating information without priori knowledge of signal statistics in 3d - wsn .",
    "hence , information estimation in 3d - wsn is a challenging task ( e.g estimating accurate information in under - water ) .",
    "_ 3 . to extract maximum information in a sensor network ,",
    "maximum nodes deployment is necessary for some specific sensing region where sensor signal penetration may be difficult _ : as discussed in the previous section , sensor nodes can be deployed deterministically and randomly in a sensing field to extract information in a network . but",
    "both the deployment scenarios fails to extract accurate information in a network as we are not aware where to place sensor nodes to get more information . to clarify this , lets assume sensor nodes deployment scenario in a forest to sense temperature in a specific sensing region like 3d - space . throughout the paper",
    ", we assume deployment of sensor nodes in a 3d - space to measure temperature as an example . as nodes are deployed randomly",
    ", it may be possible that at some sensing region ( 3d - space ) , placing more sensor nodes are required to maximize the information .",
    "generally , sensor signal penetration is less in dense forest ( tree dominated ) region in 3d space . in such region ,",
    "more number of sensor nodes can be deployed to extract more information .",
    "but it is unclear as what exactly the upper bound of sensor nodes to be deployed in such a region to extract adequate information .",
    "here , optimal node placement plays an important role to maximize information accuracy where sensor signal penetration is difficult .",
    "sensor nodes are placed closer to the target event to maximize the information accuracy _ : we take another scenario , where we deploy sensor nodes closer to the event @xcite target to maximize information accuracy in 3d network .",
    "placing sensor nodes closer to the target event may extract more information than placing sensor node far apart from the event .",
    "but it does nt give any clear idea at what minimum distance , nodes are to be deployed with respect to the target event and by which topology nodes can be deployed to extract more information in a network",
    ". it may be possible that placing sensor nodes closer to target event may cause more noise distortion @xcite due to signal interference . in this case , a deployment topology in 3d space can be developed by which sensor nodes can be placed with minimum distance with respect to the target event to extract information without noise distortion .",
    "_ 5 . we give emphasize on temporal data collection as there may be variation of data collected depending upon the node placement in 3d space _ :",
    "generally , data collected in a sensor networks have spatio - temporal correlation among them .",
    "some times , it is more important to give emphasise on temporal information than spatial information for node deployment strategy in 3d space . considering a network scenario in a forest , where a set of sensor nodes are deployed under the shade of dense trees and another set of nodes",
    "are placed directly under sunlight . assuming that both the set of nodes are placed close to each other in the sensing region .",
    "since both set of sensor nodes are closer and collects an event feature ( i.e temperature ) , there is a difference in variation of temporal data collected by them as one set of nodes is placed under shade of tree and other placed directly under sunlight . in this case , we deploy sensor node such that more nodes are to be placed under shade of a tree due to week sensor signal where as less number of sensor nodes are placed directly under sunlight .",
    "still , it is unclear that what is the maximum number ( upper bound ) of nodes to be placed under shade of a tree and minimum number ( lower bound ) of nodes to be deployed under sunlight to get information accuracy in a network .",
    "thus optimal deployment of nodes is necessary for this scenario .",
    "consideration may be given to spatial data correlation among sensor nodes to determine minimum number of sensor nodes required to maximize information accuracy _ : we consider a network scenario , where a set of sensor nodes are close to each other and directly collects data from sunlight in a sensing region .",
    "in this case , sensor nodes have almost similar signal variance and therefore , consideration is given to spatial data correlation among sensor nodes in a network .",
    "we make use of spatial data correlation among sensor nodes to determine optimal sensor nodes in a network with maximum information accuracy .",
    "in this section , we develop the following mathematical basis of our models : firstly , we develop a three dimensional distributed clustering ( 3d - dc ) algorithm in 3d space .",
    "secondly , with in each cluster , we develop three dimensional information estimation ( 3d - ie ) model at ch node of the cluster .",
    "3d - dc and 3d - ie algorithms are the extension of work presented in @xcite . finally , three dimentional node placement ( 3d - np ) algorithm is developed for the network which maintains a desired information accuracy .      considering a static source event which propagates its signal spherically in 3d space @xcite .",
    "we ignore the attenuation or propagation delay of signal from the source event . assuming that the nodes which are within the spherical signal range can only sense the source event .",
    "the information extracted by sensor nodes for the source event can be modelled as spatial data correlation using exponential model @xcite , @xcite given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the smoothness parameter which gives the geometric attributes of the propagated signals , @xmath19 is the range parameter which determines the delay of signal w.r.t to distance and @xmath20 is the distance among the source event to the sensor nodes in 3d space . using exponential model , we develop the 3d - dc algorithm as follows : data correlation between source event to number of sensor nodes in 3d space ; data correlation model among sensor nodes ; formation of distributed clusters in 3d space .",
