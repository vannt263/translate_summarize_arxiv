    "in 1957 landau @xcite predicted the existence of new collective modes of a degenerate fermi liquid in the high frequency and low temperature limits where local thermal equilibrium can not be established .",
    "one of these so - called zero sound modes , the longitudinal mode , was observed by abel _",
    "@xcite in 1966 .",
    "the second predicted zero sound mode was transverse sound .",
    "it is intriguing that the conditions on shear stiffness that are required for propagation of a transverse wave might be satisfied in a liquid , and in particular in the fermi liquid @xmath0he .",
    "nonetheless , the second mode predicted by landau has never been observed @xcite .",
    "moores and sauls @xcite pointed out that transverse sound might propagate at low temperatures in the b - phase of superfluid @xmath0he as a consequence of its coupling to the imaginary squashing mode ( isq ) , a well - established collective mode of the order parameter .",
    "they predicted a significant increase in the velocity owing to an off - resonant coupling with the isq which would significantly enhance the observability of transverse sound .",

    "according to the theory and subsequent experimental work @xcite , we know that this coupled transverse mode propagates only at frequencies between that of the isq - mode , shown as the blue curve in fig .  [ fig1 ] , and pair breaking , the black curve . in the present work",
    "we investigate the region near the pair breaking threshold in superfluid @xmath0he exploiting both transverse and longitudinal sound modes using acoustic cavity inerference methods .",
    "we recently reported observation of a new collective mode near the pair - breaking energy , @xmath4 , based on anomalies in phase velocity , attenuation and acoustic birefringence of transverse sound @xcite .",
    "the additional measurements we present here are made possible by improvements in acoustic techniques , notably acoustic cavity interferometry and pressure sweeps at low temperature .",
    "our measurements of this mode establish a lower bound for the energy gap , @xmath5 , since the energy , @xmath6 , of the 2@xmath5-mode is close to , but below , the pair - breaking threshold , @xmath4 .",
    "previous reports of the pair - breaking threshold based on longitudinal sound attenuation @xcite are difficult to reconcile with theory since they give values ( at low pressure ) less than bcs weak - coupling . in the pressure range from 1 to 20 bar ,",
    "we find that the gap always lies above weak - coupling values .",
    "additionally , we compare measurements of longitudinal sound with transverse sound .",
    "we find that longitudinal sound continues to propagate at energies far above @xmath4 , albeit with significantly high attenuation . from longitudinal sound attenuation",
    "we extract the threshold energy for pair - breaking at 3.7 bar , consistent with the lower bounds established by the @xmath4-mode .",

    "however , the results of these different analyses are ambiguous owing to imprecision of the fermi liquid parameters , @xmath11 , as well as non - trivial strong coupling contributions to the isq - mode frequencies @xcite .",
    "the strength of the @xmath1-wave pairing interactions can be estimated from the @xmath4-mode energies in terms of the theory @xcite if assumptions are made about the high order fermi liquid parameter , @xmath3 .",

    "it is traditional to refer to these modes by their total angular momentum , @xmath12 , and to indicate explicitly their parity under particle - hole conversion .",
    "then the isq is called the @xmath13 mode , the rsq is the @xmath14 mode and the new mode , as predicted , would be @xmath2 . particle - hole symmetry is relevant to the strength of the coupling of order parameter collective modes to sound @xcite .",

    "<S> changes in the transverse phase velocity near pair - breaking have been explained in terms of an order parameter collective mode that arises from @xmath1-wave pairing interactions , the so - called @xmath2 mode . using these measurements , we establish lower bounds on the energy gap in the b - phase . </S>",
