    "recently an @xmath0 supersymmetric generalization of the two - dimensional darboux transformation was proposed in @xcite in terms of @xmath1 superfields , and an infinite class of bosonic and fermionic solutions of its symmetry equation was constructed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these solutions generate bosonic and fermionic flows of the complex @xmath1 supersymmetric toda lattice hierarchy which actually possesses a more rich symmetry , namely complex @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
    "its one - dimensional reduction possessing complex @xmath3 supersymmetry the complex @xmath3 toda chain hierarchy was discussed in @xcite . there , the lax pair representations of the bosonic and fermionic flows , the corresponding local and nonlocal hamiltonians , finite and infinite discrete symmetries , the first two hamiltonian structures and the recursion operator were constructed . furthermore , its nonequivalent real forms in real @xmath4 superspace were analyzed in @xcite , where the relation to the complex @xmath3 supersymmetric kdv hierarchy @xcite was established .",
    "consecutively , the reduction of the complex @xmath3 supersymmetric toda chain hierarchy from complex @xmath4 superspace to complex @xmath5 superspace was analyzed in @xcite , where also its lax - pair and hamiltonian descriptions were developed in detail .",
    "here , we call this reduction the _ complex twisted n=2 supersymmetric toda chain hierarchy _ , due to the common symmetry properties of its three different real forms which will be discussed in what follows ( see the paragraph after eq .",

    "the main goals of the present letter are firstly to analyze real forms of this hierarchy in real @xmath5 superspace with one even and one odd real coordinate , secondly to derive a manifest twisted @xmath4 supersymmetric representation of its simplest non - trivial even flows in twisted @xmath4 superspace , and thirdly to clarify its relations ( if any ) with other known hierarchies ( s - toda @xcite , modified nls and derivative nls hierarchies ) .",

    "it is the algebra of symmetries of the nonlinear even flows ( [ eqs])([flow3 ] ) .",
    "the generators may be realized in the superspace @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are bosonic ( fermionic ) abelian evolution times with length dimensions @xmath27=[h_k]=k , \\quad [ \\theta_k ] = [ \\rho_k]=k-\\frac{1}{2 } \\label{dim}\\ ] ] which are in one - to - one correspondence with the length dimensions ( [ dimtimes ] ) of the corresponding evolution derivatives .",
    "the flows @xmath28 can be derived from the flows @xmath29 of the complex @xmath3 toda chain hierarchy @xcite by the reduction constraint @xmath30 which leads to the correspondence @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the fermionic derivatives of the present paper , where @xmath33 is the imaginary unit and @xmath34 are the grassmann coordinates of the @xmath4 superspace in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that different real forms derived from the same complex integrable hierarchy are nonequivalent in general . keeping this in mind it seems important to find as many different real forms of the complex twisted @xmath4 toda chain hierarchy as possible .    with this aim",
    "let us discuss various nonequivalent complex conjugations of the superfields @xmath6 and @xmath7 , of the superspace coordinates @xmath35 , and of the evolution derivatives @xmath36 which should be consistent with the flows ( [ eqs1])([qqq1 ] ) .",
    "we restrict our considerations to the case when @xmath37 and @xmath9 are coordinates of real @xmath5 superspace which satisfy the following standard complex conjugation properties : @xmath38 we will also use the standard convention regarding complex conjugation of products involving odd operators and functions ( see , e.g. , the books @xcite ) . in particular , if @xmath39 is some even differential operator acting on a superfield @xmath40 , we define the complex conjugate of @xmath39 by @xmath41",
    ". then , in the case under consideration one can derive , for example , the following relations @xmath42 which we use in what follows .",

    "let us remark that , although most of the flows of the complex twisted @xmath4 supersymmetric toda chain hierarchy can be derived by reduction ( [ ccccc ] ) , its real forms in @xmath5 superspace ( [ conj ] ) can not be derived in this way from the real forms of the complex @xmath3 toda chain hierarchy in the real @xmath4 superspace @xmath45 found in @xcite .",
    "this conflict arises because the constraint ( [ ccccc ] ) is inconsistent with the reality properties ( [ conjn4 ] ) of the @xmath4 superspace .",
    "we would like to underline that the flows ( [ eqs1])([qqq1 ] ) form a particular realization of the algebra ( [ alg1])([algqqbar ] ) in terms of the @xmath5 superfields @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "although the classification of real forms of affine and conformal superalgebras was given in a series of classical papers @xcite ( see also interesting paper @xcite for recent discussions and references therein ) we can not obtain the complex conjugations of the target space superfields @xmath46 using only this base .",
    "it is a rather different , non - trivial task to construct the corresponding complex conjugations of various realizations of a superalgebra which are relevant in the context of integrable hierarchies .",
    "moreover , different complex conjugations of a given ( super)algebra realization may correspond to the same real form of the ( super)algebra , while some of its other existing real forms may not be reproducible on the base of a given particular realization . in what follows we will demonstrate that this is exactly the case for the realization under consideration .",
    "we shall see that complex conjugations of the target space superfields @xmath46 correspond to the twisted real @xmath4 supersymmetry .",
    "direct verification shows that the flows ( [ eqs1])([qqq1 ] ) admit the following three nonequivalent complex conjugations ( meaning that it is not possible to relate them via obvious symmetries ) : @xmath47 \\begin{split } & ( v , u)^{\\bullet}= ( u , v ) , \\quad ( iz,{{\\theta}})^{\\bullet}=(iz,{\\theta } ) , \\\\ & ( t_p , u_p,{\\epsilon}_p d_p , { \\varepsilon}_pq_p)^{\\bullet}=(-t_p , u_p , { \\epsilon}_p d_p,{\\varepsilon}_pq_p ) ,   \\end{split } \\label{conj2 } \\\\[1ex ] \\begin{split } & ( v,~u)^{\\star}=(~-u(qd\\ln u+uv),~ \\frac{1}{u}~ ) , \\quad ( iz,{\\theta})^{\\star}=(iz,{\\theta}),\\\\ & ( t_p , u_p,{\\epsilon}_p d_p,{\\varepsilon}_pq_p)^{\\star}=(-t_p , u_p , -{\\epsilon}_p d_p , -{\\varepsilon}_pq_p ) , \\end{split } \\label{conj3}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constant odd real parameters .",
    "we would like to underline that the complex conjugations of the evolution derivatives ( the second lines of eqs .",
    "( [ conj1])([conj3 ] ) ) are defined and fixed completely by the explicit expressions ( [ eqs1])([qqq1 ] ) for the flows .",
    "these complex conjugations extract three different real forms of the complex integrable hierarchy we started with , while all the real forms of the flows algebra ( [ alg1])([algqqbar ] ) correspond to the same algebra of a twisted global real @xmath4 supersymmetry .",
    "this last fact becomes obvious if one uses the @xmath4 basis of the algebra with the generators @xmath50 then , the nonzero algebra brackets ( [ alg1])([algqqbar ] ) and the complex conjugation rules ( [ conj1])([conj3 ] ) are the standard ones for the twisted @xmath4 supersymmetry algebra together with its non  compact @xmath51 automorphism , @xmath52=+{\\cal d}_1 , \\quad \\ ~~\\bigl[u_0\\,,\\,{\\overline { \\cal d}}_1\\bigr]=-{\\overline { \\cal d}}_1 , \\label{algnn2 } \\\\[1ex ] ( { \\textstyle{\\partial\\over\\partial t_1 } } , u_0,{\\gamma}_1{\\cal d}_1 , { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1 { \\overline { \\cal d}}_1)^{*}= ( -{\\textstyle{\\partial\\over\\partial t_1}},u_0 , + { \\gamma}_1{\\cal d}_1 , + { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1 { \\overline { \\cal d}}_1 ) , \\quad ( { \\gamma}_1 , { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1)^{*}= ( { \\gamma}_1 , { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1 ) , \\label{conjn21 } \\\\[1ex ] ( { \\textstyle{\\partial\\over\\partial t_1 } } , u_0,{\\gamma}_1{\\cal d}_1 , { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1 { \\overline { \\cal d}}_1)^{\\bullet}= ( -{\\textstyle{\\partial\\over\\partial t_1}},u_0 , + { \\gamma}_1{\\cal d}_1 , + { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1 { \\overline { \\cal d}}_1 ) , \\quad ( { \\gamma}_1 , { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1)^{\\bullet}= ( { \\gamma}_1 , { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1 ) , \\label{conjn22 } \\\\[1ex ] ( { \\textstyle{\\partial\\over\\partial t_1 } } , u_0,{\\gamma}_1{\\cal d}_1 , { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1 { \\overline { \\cal d}}_1)^{\\star}= ( -{\\textstyle{\\partial\\over\\partial t_1}},u_0 , -{\\gamma}_1{\\cal d}_1 , -{\\overline { \\gamma}}_1 { \\overline { \\cal d}}_1 ) , \\quad ( { \\gamma}_1 , { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1)^{\\star}= ( { \\gamma}_1 , { \\overline { \\gamma}}_1 ) , \\label{conjn23}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are constant odd real parameters .",

    "let us remark that a combination of the two involutions ( [ conj3 ] ) and ( [ conj2 ] ) generates the infinite - dimensional group of discrete darboux transformations @xcite @xmath54 this way of deriving discrete symmetries was proposed in @xcite and applied to the construction of discrete symmetry transformations of the @xmath4 supersymmetric gnls hierarchies .    to close this section",
    "let us stress once more that we can not claim to have exhausted _ all _ complex conjugations of the twisted @xmath4 toda chain hierarchy by the three examples of complex conjugations ( eqs .",
    "( [ conj1])([conj3 ] ) ) we have constructed . finding complex conjugations for affine ( super)algebras themselves is a problem solved by the classification of @xcite but rather different from constructing complex conjugations for different _ realizations _ of affine ( super)algebras . to our knowledge , no algorithm yet exists for solving this rather complicated second problem .",
    "thus , classifying _ all _ complex conjugations is out of the scope of the present letter .",
    "rather , we have constructed these examples in order to use them merely as tools to generate the important discrete symmetries ( [ discrsymm ] ) as well as to construct a convenient superfield basis and a manifest twisted @xmath4 superfield representation ( see sections 3 and 4 ) , with the aim to clarify the relationships of the hierarchy under consideration to other physical hierarchies discussed in the literature ( see section  5 ) .",
    "the third complex conjugation ( [ conj3 ] ) looks rather complicated when compared to the first two ones ( [ conj1])([conj2 ] ) .",

    "it is well known that there are often hidden relationships between a priori unrelated hierarchies .",
    "some examples are the @xmath4 nls and @xmath4 @xmath84 kdv @xcite , the `` quasi '' @xmath3 kdv and @xmath4 @xmath85 boussinesq @xcite , the @xmath4 ( 1,1)-gnls and @xmath3 kdv @xcite , the @xmath3 toda and @xmath3 kdv @xcite .",
    "these relationships may lead to a deeper understanding of the hierarchies .",
    "they may help to obtain a more complete description and to derive solutions .",
    "the absence of odd derivatives in the equations ( [ eqs2jn=4])([eqs2jn=4t3 ] ) , starting off the twisted @xmath4 supersymmetric toda chain hierarchy , gives additional evidence in favour of a hidden relationship with some bosonic hierarchy .",
    "it turns out that such a relationship indeed exists .",
    "let us search it first at the level of the darboux transformations ( [ discrsymm2 ] ) , then in the second flow equation ( [ eqs2jn=4 ] ) .    for this purpose , we introduce new @xmath5 superfields @xmath86 via @xmath87 the darboux transformations ( [ discrsymm2 ] ) , expressed in terms of those new superfields ,",
    "exactly reproduce the darboux - backlund ( s - toda ) transformations @xmath88 proposed in @xcite in the context of the reduction of the supersymmetric kp hierarchy in @xmath5 superspace characterized by the lax operator @xmath89 for completeness , we also present the corresponding second flow equations , @xmath90 which also follow from @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are led to the conclusion that the two integrable hierarchies related to the reductions ( [ lax1 ] ) and ( [ lax2 ] ) are _ equivalent_. it would be interesting to establish a relationship ( if any ) between these two hierarchies in the more general case where @xmath91 and @xmath92 entering the corresponding lax operators ( [ lax1 ] ) and ( [ lax2 ] ) are rectangular ( super)matrix - valued superfields @xcite , but this rather complicated question is outside the scope of the present letter . in general , these two families of @xmath4 supersymmetric hierarchies correspond to a non - trivial supersymmetrization of bosonic hierarchies , except for the simplest case we consider here .",
    "indeed , a simple inspection shows that the equations ( [ eqs2jn=4])([eqs2jn=4t3 ] ) do not contain fermionic derivatives and belong to the hierarchy which is the trivial @xmath4 supersymmetrization of the bosonic modified nls or derivative nls hierarchy .",
    "this last fact becomes obvious if one introduces yet a new superfield basis @xmath93 through @xmath94 in which the second flow ( [ eqs2jn=4 ] ) and the darboux transformations ( [ discrsymm2 ] ) become @xmath95 respectively , and the equation ( [ eqsmnls ] ) reproduces the trivial @xmath4 supersymmetrization of the modified nls equation @xcite .",
    "when passing to alternative superfields @xmath96 and @xmath97 defined by the following invertible transformations @xmath98 equation ( [ eqsmnls ] ) becomes @xmath99 and coincides with the derivative nls equation @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that one can produce the _ non - trivial _",
    "@xmath4 supersymmetric modified kdv hierarchy by secondary reduction even though the twisted @xmath4 toda chain hierarchy is a",
    "_ trivial _ @xmath4 supersymmetrization of the modified or derivative nls hierarchy .",
    "one of such reductions was described in @xcite . in terms of the superfields @xmath62 and @xmath78 ( [ basis ] ) , the reduction constraint is @xmath100 and only half of the flows from the set ( [ dimtimes ] ) are consistent with this reduction , namely @xmath101 ( for details , see @xcite ) . substituting the constraint ( [ red1 ] ) into the third flow equation ( [ eqs2jt3 ] ) of the reduced hierarchy , this flow becomes @xmath102 now , one can easily recognize that the equation for the bosonic component reproduces the modified kdv equation and does not contain the fermionic component at all .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that the supersymmetrization ( [ redflow3 ] ) is rather non - trivial , because it involves the odd operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 but does not admit odd flows having length dimension @xmath103=[q]=-1/2 $ ] .",
    "hence , it does not seem to be possible to avoid a dependence of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in a cleverly chosen superfield basis . to close this discussion",
    "let us mention that the possible alternative constraint on the twisted @xmath4 superfields @xmath104 and @xmath105 , namely @xmath106 leads again to the trivial @xmath4 supersymmetrization of the modified kdv hierarchy .",
