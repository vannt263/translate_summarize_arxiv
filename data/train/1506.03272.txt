    "when a fluctuating field is confined by material bodies , effective forces arise on them . this is due to the fact that the bodies impose boundary conditions on the medium , depending on their geometry , mutual position and material properties , which leads to a modification of the allowed fluctuations in the medium .",
    "the last leads to a dependence of the ground state , or the thermodynamic potential of the system ( say the free energy ) on the geometry of the system and on the distances between its ( macroscopic ) components . in order to change these distances",
    "one has to apply a force that depends on the induced change of the allowed fluctuations .",
    "if the fluctuations are long - ranged the corresponding forces are also long - ranged .",
    "the existence of such long - ranged fluctuation mediated forces is called the casimir effect and the corresponding forces ",
    "casimir like forces @xcite , after the dutch physicist hendrik casimir who in 1948 predicted an attractive force between two parallel perfectly conducting metal plates @xcite separated by a finite gap @xmath0 in vacuum at zero temperature . in order",
    "the force to be long - ranged ( i.e. , to decay in a power - law and not in an exponential with the distance way ) the interactions in the system have to be mediated by massless excitations ",
    "photons , goldstone bosons , acoustic phonons , etc . considered in this general form",
    "the casimir effect is a subject of investigations in condensed matter physics , quantum electrodynamics , quantum chromodynamics and cosmology .",
    "the results are summarized in an impressive number of reviews @xcite .    when the fluctuating field is the electromagnetic one the effect is known as the quantum _ electro - dynamical _ ( qed ) casimir effect . there",
    "the casimir force is caused by zero - point and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . in first approximation",
    ", it depends only on the velocity of light @xmath7 , planck s constant @xmath8 , the temperature @xmath3 , and the separation distance between the bodies @xmath0 , i.e. , this force to a great extend is _",
    "universal_. a more advanced theory , the so - called lifshitz theory , reveals the dependence of the casimir force on the material properties of the bodies @xcite and geometry of their boundary surfaces @xcite .",
    "thirty years after casimir s prediction , m. e. fisher and p. g. de gennes suggested that the fluctuating medium , confined between the bodies can be a fluid , the fluctuating field being the field of its order parameter , in which the interactions in the system are mediated not by photons but by different type of massless excitations like critical fluctuations or goldstone bosons ( spin waves ) .",
    "the corresponding casimir effect is known as the _ thermodynamic _ casimir effect @xcite . when the confined fluid approaches it s critical point , the corresponding fluctuations are the critical fluctuations of the order parameter and then the effect is usually called _",
    "critical _ casimir effect . in first approximation",
    ", the thermodynamic casimir effect depends only on the gross features of the system  its dimensionality @xmath9 and the symmetry of the ordered state @xmath10 ( both defining the so - called bulk universality class of the system ) and on the boundary conditions ( determined by the surface universality classes ) .",
    "therefore , to a great extend the thermodynamic casimir force is also _",
    "universal_. so far the critical casimir effect has enjoyed two general reviews @xcite and some concerning specific aspects of it @xcite .    currently the casimir effect is an object of intensive studies both in its original formulation due to casimir as well as in its thermodynamic manifestation . in the present article",
    "we will report theoretical results dealing with the critical casimir effect .",
    "let us note , that the critical casimir effect has been already directly observed , utilizing light scattering measurements , in the interaction of a colloid spherical particle with a plate @xcite both of which are immersed in a binary liquid mixture .",
    "the effect has been also studied in @xmath11he @xcite,@xcite , as well as in @xmath12he@xmath11he mixtures @xcite in the context of forces that determine the properties of a film of a substance in the vicinity of its bulk critical point . in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite one has performed measurements of the casimir force in thin wetting films of binary liquid mixture .",
    "one the theoretical side , the effect has been studied via exact calculations in the two - dimensional ising model @xcite , the three dimensional spherical model @xcite , via conformal - theoretical methods @xcite , within mean - field type calculations on ising type @xcite and @xmath13 models @xcite , through renormalization - group studies via @xmath14-expansion @xcite and via fixed dimension @xmath9 techniques @xcite of @xmath15 models , as well as via monte - carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation of importance in all of the above mentioned models are of thermal origin since all these models possess non - zero critical temperature . in some systems , however , certain quantum parameters govern the fluctuations near their critical point which is usually close to or at the zero temperature @xcite . in this particular case one",
    "speaks of a _ quantum critical _ casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the rapid progress in nanotechnology has resulted in the growth of interest in fluctuation - induced phenomena , which play a dominant role between neutral non - magnetic objects at short separation distances ( below a micrometer ) .",
    "the van der waals and casimir forces , both known under the generic name _",
    "dispersion forces _ , play a key role in micro- and nano - electromechanical systems ( mems / nems ) @xcite operating at such distances . indeed ,",
    "upon scaling down devices , the dispersion forces can induce some usually undesirable non - linear behaviors in such systems @xcite .",
    "irreversible phenomena appear such as stiction ( i.e. , irreversible adhesion ) or pull - in due to mechanical instabilities @xcite .",
    "therefore the ability to modify the casimir interaction can strongly influence the development of mems / nems .",
    "several theorems seriously limit , however , the possible search of repulsive casimir forces @xcite .",
    "currently , apart from some suggestions for achieving casimir repulsion in systems out of equilibrium @xcite , the only experimentally well verified way to obtain repulsive casimir force is to have interaction between two different materials characterized by dielectric permittivities @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that @xcite @xmath18 along the imaginary frequency axis , with @xmath19 being the dielectric permittivity of the medium in between them . in refs .",
    "@xcite casimir repulsion was indeed observed experimentally for the sphere - plate geometry .    in the current article",
    "we study the interplay between the critical casimir force and the van der waals one in a system composed out of two flat parallel slabs both immersed in a critical fluid .",
    "let us note that both the critical casimir and van der waals forces are fluctuation induced ones but due to the fluctuations of different entities . for terminological clarity , let us also remind that in colloid sciences fluid mediated interactions between two surfaces or large particles are usually referred to as solvation forces @xcite .",
    "thus , we study here a particular case of such a force when the fluid is near its critical point . in our system",
    "we suppose that the slabs are coated by thin layers of some substances , confining either a non - polar one - component fluid or a non - polar binary liquid mixture . we suppose that the liquid phase of the one - component fluid or one of the components of the binary liquid mixture are strongly adsorbed by _ both _ coating layers , i.e.",
    ", they ensure the so - called @xmath1 boundary conditions . the slabs , on the other hand , influence the fluid by long - range competing dispersion potentials .",
    "in the case of a simple fluid these potentials increase the adsorption of the fluid near one of the surfaces , leading to preference there of its liquid phase , and decrease it near the other one . in the case of a binary fluid mixture",
    "the substrates prefer one of the components near the top and the other one near the bottom of the system .",
    "we will demonstrate that this experimentally realizable competition between the effects due to the coatings and the slabs can result in interesting effects like sign change of the casimir force , acting between the surfaces confining the fluid when one changes @xmath20 , @xmath4 or @xmath0 .",
    "the last facts can potentially be used in designing nanodevices and for governing the behavior of objects at small , below micrometer , distances .    if a fluid system possesses a surface it breaks the spatial symmetry of the bulk system .",
    "the quantitative effects of the presence of a surface on the thermodynamic behavior of the system depends on the penetration depth of this symmetry breaking effect into the volume .",
    "there are two phenomena which increase the surface effects : long - range interactions and long - range correlations .",
    "they can act separately , or simultaneously , which leads to an interesting interplay of the effects due to any of them @xcite . the penetration depth due to the correlations",
    "is set by the correlation length @xmath21 of the order parameter of the system ; @xmath21 becomes large , and theoretically diverges , in the vicinity of the bulk critical point @xmath22 : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the usual critical exponents . if the system is made finite , e.g. , by the introduction of a second wall the behavior of the fluid is further enriched .",
    "when @xmath21 becomes comparable to the characteristic system size , say @xmath0 , the size dependence of thermodynamic functions enters through the ratio @xmath29 , i.e. , takes a scaling form given by the finite - size scaling theory @xcite that incorporates , _ inter alia _ , shift of the critical point of the system @xcite . below @xmath30",
    "if the confining walls of the film geometry consist of the same material , one encounters the phenomenon of capillary condensation @xcite where the confinement of the fluid causes , e.g. , the liquid vapor coexistence line to shift away from the coexistence line of the bulk fluid into the one - phase regime . we will demonstrate in the current article that in the envisaged realization of our system depending on the material properties of the slabs the phase diagram of the finite system might essentially differ from that one of the well studied case of a system with short - ranged type interactions and strongly adsorbing surfaces .",
    "the article is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermalcas ] we recall and comment on the finite - size behaviour of systems with dispersion forces extending the known facts to the expected behavior of the casimir and the net forces when they act between walls being semi - infinite slabs coated by some thin substances . by doing so , we especially pay attention to the conditions under which the effects stemming from these interactions are relevant .",

    "<S> we study , using general scaling arguments and mean - field type calculations , the behavior of the critical casimir force and its interplay with the van der waals force acting between two parallel slabs separated at a distance @xmath0 from each other , confining some fluctuating fluid medium , say a non - polar one - component fluid or a binary liquid mixture . </S>",
    "<S> the surfaces of the slabs are coated by thin layers exerting strong preference to the liquid phase of the fluid , or one of the components of the mixture , modeled by strong adsorbing local surface potentials ensuring the so - called @xmath1 boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the slabs , on the other hand , influence the fluid by long - range competing dispersion potentials , which represent irrelevant interactions in renormalization group sense . under such conditions </S>",
    "<S> one usually expects _ attractive _ casimir force governed by universal scaling function , pertinent to the extraordinary surface universality class of ising type systems , to which the dispersion potentials provide only corrections to scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , however , that below a given threshold thickness of the system @xmath2 for a suitable set of slabs - fluid and fluid - fluid coupling parameters the competition between the effects due to the coatings and the slabs can result in _ sign change _ of the casimir force acting between the surfaces confining the fluid when one changes the temperature @xmath3 , the chemical potential of the fluid @xmath4 , or @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the last implies that by choosing specific materials for the slabs , coatings and the fluid for @xmath5 one can realize _ repulsive _ casimir force with _ non - universal _ behavior which , upon increasing @xmath0 , gradually turns into an _ attractive _ one described by an _ </S>",
    "<S> universal _ scaling function , depending only on the relevant scaling fields related to the temperature and the excess chemical potential , for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we presented arguments and relevant data for specific substances in support of the experimental feasibility of the predicted behavior of the force . </S>",
    "<S> it can be of interest , e.g. , for designing nano - devices and for governing behavior of objects , say colloidal particles , at small distances . we have formulated the corresponding criterion for determination of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the universality is regained for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that for systems with @xmath5 the capillary condensation phase diagram suffers modifications which one does not observe in systems with purely short - ranged interactions . </S>"
