    "microwave kinetic inductance detectors , mkids , have significant promise in astronomical detector applications @xcite .",
    "a generic mkid consists of a microwave resonator that is coupled to a feedline , leading to a dip in the transmission at the resonator s resonant frequency .",
    "one of the most important aspects of these devices is that they can be frequency multiplexed by fabricating many resonators with slightly different resonant frequencies , and thus they all can be coupled to a common readout bus . in this case , each resonator rings at a frequency @xmath4 , where the l and c are the device s inductance and capacitance , respectively .",
    "while in most instances the inductance and capacitance are defined overwhelmingly by geometry , for superconductors the inductance has an additional term due to the finite inertia of the cooper pairs , i.e. , the kinetic inductance . from mattis - bardeen theory ,",
    "the kinetic inductance can be approximated@xcite by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the film s resistivity , @xmath7 is the thickness and @xmath8 is the film s superconducting gap .",
    "when an incident photon is absorbed by the superconducting resonator , the photon breaks cooper pairs creating excess quasiparticles .",
    "these quasiparticles increase the kinetic inductance and shift the resonance to a lower frequency .",
    "hence , the material s intrinsic kinetic inductance and superconducting transition temperature , @xmath3 , are critical parameters to increase the sensitivity and ensure that photons in the desired frequency range f have the requisite energy to be absorbed and create quaisparticles , i.e. @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the cooper - pair binding energy and h is planck s constant . more specifically , astronomical applications such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) search desire detection of 90 ghz light , necessitating a @xmath11 1 k.    in addition to matching this stringent @xmath3 requirement , superconducting materials for mkids should exhibit other properties such as a high kinetic inductance , low loss ( i.e. high quality factor ) and low frequency noise .",
    "recent advances in the use of titanium nitride ( tin ) have shown that it meets these criteria , @xcite resulting in greater sensitivity than elemental superconductors such as nb or al .",
    "just as importantly , tin also has a tunable @xmath3 .",
    "while stoichiometric tin has a @xmath3 above 4.5 k , substoichiometric tin@xmath12 ( x @xmath13 1 ) exhibits a @xmath3 that can be considerably lower .",
    "the nitrogen percentage also alters the film crystallography and resistivity , affecting the film s kinetic inductance and the resulting device performance . in this paper",
    "we investigate how the structure and @xmath3 of the ti - n compounds grown by reactive sputtering change by varying the ratio of the ar - n@xmath0 gas inside the sputtering chamber during deposition .",
    "we also apply spectroscopic ellipsometry to these films and show that the film s measured ellipsometric properties are correlated to the final @xmath3 .",
    "the binary phase diagram of titanium and nitrogen shows that several different compounds are stable as the ti : n atomic ratio is altered at our @xmath14 growth temperatures@xcite . for the lowest n@xmath0 percentages an @xmath1-ti phase is initially formed , where n is incorporated interstitially in the ti lattice .",
    "this is followed by a narrow band near 33 @xmath15 atomic n fraction of the compound ti@xmath0n . at higher nitrogen fractions , tin@xmath12 is stable in a broad range from a substoichiometric x=0.6 to an overstoichiometric x=1.2 @xcite .",
    "previously@xcite , varying the nitrogen fraction in the gas mixture used to reactively sputter ti - n compounds has been shown to alter the measured @xmath3 from 0 k to over 4.5 k.    the composition of the deposited ti - n compounds from reactive sputtering can be altered by changing the effective flux of ar : n atoms impinging on and reacting with the ti sputter target . during sputtering ,",
    "there is competition between two different processes : lighter n ions react with ti on the surface to form ti - n , and inert ar ions sputter the ti atoms and ti - n molecules from the target @xcite .",
    "the amount of freshly exposed ti at the target from the ar sputtering determines the amount of available sites for nitrogen reaction .",
    "if the nitrogen flow exceeds the rate at which the ti is exposed , the surface of the target will be completely nitrided , i.e. poisoned , and only tin will be sputtered .",
    "conversely , if the ar removes the ti faster than it can be nitrided , then both ti and tin will be sputtered onto the substrate with a controllable ratio .",
    "assuming that all the reactive nitrogen is consumed at the target , this ratio of deposited ti : tin determines the composition of the film .",
    "however , as all the gases in our chamber are delivered centrally in the chamber instead of directly at the gun , additional nitridization of non - fully bonded ti is also seen at the substrate , as is shown below .",
    "this dependence indicates that the tin@xmath12 is not fully in a stable phase when deposited , and is sensitive to additional nitridization on the substrate .",
    "although the local change in the tin@xmath12 nitrogen percentage is minor , since the @xmath3 of the film is so sensitive to composition at the steepest point of the curve a substantial variation in the measured @xmath3 across the wafer has been observed@xcite .",
    "the tin films in this work are sputter deposited onto 3 \" ( 100 ) oriented si substrates in a chamber with a base pressure of @xmath16 torr at room temperature . a three inch diameter , 99.995 % pure ti target",
    "is sputtered in a reactive atmosphere of ar and n@xmath0 , depositing tin onto the rotating substrate .",
    "the ti target is initially pre - sputtered in an atmosphere of pure ar to remove any tin or other contamination from the target surface .",
    "the target preparation is important because the growth process of tin is hysteretic , i.e. the deposition rate depends upon whether the target starts in the clean - ti or fully poisoned tin limit . during the depositions ,",
    "the total pressure was kept fixed by throttling a variable position gate valve at @xmath17 mtorr .",
    "the ar flow was maintained at @xmath18 sccm for all of the depositions , and the n@xmath0 flow was modified in order to obtain the various ar : n flux ratios at the target .",
    "after the n@xmath0 flow is started , but before all the shutters were opened to begin the growth , the plasma was allowed to settle for 6 minutes to allow for n@xmath0 consumption by the ti target , and subsequent sputtering of ti and tin , to come to equilibrium .",
    "we then deposited nominally 35 nm of tin@xmath12 on each sample for the various ar : n flux ratios . before and after each growth , _ in - situ _ spectroscopic ellipsometry data were taken at wavelengths from 200 nm to 1000 nm .",
    "after the growth is completed , _ ex situ _ position dependent ellipsometry is also performed , and the wafer is then fabricated into unpatterened 5x1 mm sheet resistance and co - planar waveguide resonators ( cpw ) test structures , diced into chips , and cooled for @xmath3 testing in an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator ( adr ) .",
    "the adr has a base temperature of 50 mk and allows for a continuously variable temperature from the base temperature to 10 k. the @xmath3 was measured using a dc current source and voltage meter .",
    "the measured @xmath3 at the center of the different wafers as a function of n@xmath0 gas flow is shown in figure 1 and is of a similar shape as that previously reported@xcite .",
    "while the @xmath3 varies slowly in both the high and low limits of the n@xmath0 flow , the measured @xmath3 sharply changes from 0.1 k to 3 k for small changes in nitrogen flow near 2 sccm . the target @xmath3 of 1 k is located on this steep slope . in this region , changing the ar - n@xmath0 ratio by less than @xmath19 leads to the @xmath3 changing by more than 1 k. moreover , as the @xmath3 is so sensitive to the nitrogen percentage in this region , we begin to see substantial variations in the film properties across the 3 \" wafer , likely from additional nitridization of unbonded ti at the substrate . as shown in figure 2(b ) , the @xmath3 varies by more than @xmath20 from the center of the wafer to the edge despite the deposition rate varying by less than 1 @xmath15 across the wafer .",
    "furthermore , neither the @xmath3 nor the ellipsometric properties are strong functions of the thickness .",
    "films sputtered twice as thick or 50 % thinner with the same deposition conditions have a @xmath3 range that is almost identical . while the thinner films are no longer optically opaque , and thus have different measured optical properties , the thicker films have ellipsometric measurements that are indistinguishable from the 35 nm films with the same @xmath3 .",
    "the rotating substrate decreases the variation in @xmath3 ; static substrates ( not shown here ) generally have more than twice the anisotropy in @xmath21 .",
    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was also performed on these samples by use of a @xmath22:@xmath23 instrument .",
    "the changing crytallographic regions as a function of nitrogen content and in relation to the measured @xmath3 are also shown in figure 1 .",
    "similar to what has been seen previously in reactively sputtered tin films,@xcite the films with higher nitrogen fraction and @xmath3 are seen to have a mixture of the tin ( 111 ) and ( 200 ) orientations .",
    "as the nitrogen flow is reduced , the mixture evolves to a wholly ( 111 ) tin orientation , with @xmath3 dropping through 1 k and down to 0.4 k. however , for lower nitrogen percentages , the @xmath3 drops further and greater incorporation of the ti@xmath0n phase is seen . when the film appears to be fully ti@xmath0n , the @xmath3 is below the 50 mk lower limit of our measurement apparatus .",
    "stoichiometric ti@xmath0n is metallic , is known to be non - superconducting to below 1.2 k@xcite , and its presence suppreses @xmath3 in ti - n compounds@xcite . to the authors knowledge , no superconducting transition has ever been measured for ti@xmath0n .",
    "this implies that the mono - phase ti@xmath0n films with a @xmath24 0.05 k are not unreasonable . for films with even less n@xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath3 becomes measureable again , but as revealed by x - ray diffraction the material is now @xmath1-ti phase .",
    "pure ti films were also grown with a @xmath3 of 0.4 k.    the steep profile of @xmath3 vs n@xmath0 flow is repeatable over day to day timescales , but drifts slowly over months , likely due to target erosion , and offsets occur during chamber maintenance or after large excursions of the mass flow controller ( mfc ) .",
    "the n@xmath0 mfc has a nominal repeatability of 0.25 sccm , but in typical applications with just small changes in flow rates between growths we measure an uncertainty of only 0.05 sccm .",
    "if we compare this uncertainty to the slope of the line in figure 1 , this implies an uncertainly of 0.5 k in the @xmath3 of the film .",
    "while the @xmath3 vs n@xmath0 flow curve can be re - calibrated again using many growths and cooldowns , an accurate _ in situ _ or pre - cooldown probe of the tin composition would greatly reduce the period of time needed to refine the tin growth and also provides a pre - fabrication check of the viability of the film for the designed detectors .",
    "it has been shown previously that _ in - situ _ ellipsometry is senstive to the composition of ti - n compounds both near the stoichiometric limit @xcite as well as for lower nitrogen fractions @xcite .",
    "ellipsometry has also shown to be senstive to the n incorporation in nbtin thin films@xcite .",
    "ellipsometry is a non - destructive optical technique that illuminates a sample with an oblique beam of polarized light .",
    "the change in the polarization state of the reflected beam is measured , commonly expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the reflectivities of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 polarized light respectively . in spectroscopic",
    "ellipsometry , these values are acquired as a function of wavelength , greatly increasing the data set and permitting the determination of multiple physical properties of the sample . here",
    ", the ellipsometer is mounted onto the vacuum chamber and the light is shone through low stress windows onto the sample at an incident angle of @xmath30 70 degrees .",
    "these _ in situ _ ellipsometric data can be used to optimize growth parameters both during and after the growth .",
    "figure 3 shows that that the measured ellipsometric properties of tin films are very sensitive to the film composition . as the nitrogen concentration is reduced and the @xmath3 changes , the measured ellipsometric property @xmath8 monotonically changes as seen in fig 3(a ) .",
    "in addition to the measured ellipsometric properties , @xmath31 and @xmath8 , the same information can also be expressed in terms of the pseudo - dielectric function @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the angle of incidence .",
    "the measured data from figure 3(a ) can then be re - plotted in figure 3(b ) , the real part of the dielectric function , @xmath34 , vs photon energy @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the photon wavelength .",
    "while the difference in @xmath34 between the films with different @xmath3 s is not as striking as those seen in the measured @xmath8 , the changes do illustrate how the compositional changes in the various films are manifested .",
    "the photon energy at which @xmath37 , the real part of the dielectric function , passes through zero is generally referred to the unscreened plasma energy , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of carriers and @xmath40 is their effective mass .",
    "figure 4 shows the zero crossing of @xmath34 for the different tin@xmath12 films as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the pure ti film s zero crossing is not within our observable energy range .",
    "as the nitrogen is reduced , the @xmath3 drops and the energy of the zero - crossing increases .",
    "this implies that there is an increased number of carriers as the films become more metallic .",
    "this result is consistent with the xrd and phase diagram results as ti@xmath0n @xcite is also a metal , with a higher conductivity and carrier density than tin .",
    "the zero crossing of @xmath34 is composition dependent and is a sensitive indication of the @xmath3 of the ti - n film to within 0.5 k. the inset of figure 4 shows the value of the measured ellipsometric quantity @xmath8 at 300 nm photon wavelength . while the change in @xmath8 does not directly correspond to any physical property , it provides a more sensitive lookup table for the film @xmath3",
    ". when mounted to the chamber in the _ in situ _ configuration the optical axis is fixed , but the ellipsometer can also be mounted off the chamber with a moveable stage and ellipsometric measurements can be made as a function of position .",
    "figure 2 ( a ) shows how the energy of the zero crossing of the real part of the dielectric function @xmath37 changes across the wafer in a manner that resembles the @xmath3 measured in figure 2 ( b ) .",
    "while the ellipsometer is sensitive to the no longer pristine surface , and the measurements can not be directly mapped to the previous _ in - situ _ @xmath3 measurements , this measurement shows how the ellipsometer can be used to measure the homogeneity of the tin films , and predict the relative variation in @xmath3 .",
    "in conclusion , titanium nitride films were grown by reactive sputtering across a range of ar to n@xmath0 ratios at room temperature . by varying the gas ratio , the composition and structure of the grown film",
    "is varied .",
    "the crystallographic structure changes from tin to ti@xmath0n to @xmath1-ti as the nitrogen is reduced and the @xmath3 reduces as well from above @xmath41 k to less than @xmath42 k when the film is fully in the ti@xmath0n state before slightly rising again at the lowest n@xmath0 flows .",
    "optical measurements are sensitive to these compositional changes as well . _ in situ _ ellipsometric data clearly show the dependence on n@xmath0 flow and can be used to predict and subsequently tune the @xmath3 of the film without extensive processing and cryogenic testing .",
    "_ ex situ _ position dependent measurements also illustrate the ellipsometer s sensitivity , and provide a method to measure the film s homogeneity .",
