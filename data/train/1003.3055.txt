    "recently , the hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity has been proposed as an ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of general relativity  @xcite , motivated by the lifshitz theory in the condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "the key of the uv completion is the anisotropic scaling between space and time , @xmath0 where the lifshitz parameter @xmath1 becomes 1 in the infrared ( ir ) limit .",
    "in general , the hl theory is not invariant under the full diffeomorphism group of general relativity but under its subgroup , called the foliation - preserving diffeomorphism ; however , in the ir limit , the full diffeomorphism is somehow recovered .",
    "a mechanism for recovering the full diffeomorphism or the renormalization group flow is yet unsolved issue , but the hl gravity has been intensively studied in the area of cosmology  @xcite and black hole physics  @xcite .",
    "considering arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) decomposition   of the metric with @xmath2  @xcite , the einstein - hilbert action can be rewritten as @xmath3 \\\\    & = \\frac{c^2}{16\\pi g_n } \\int dt d^3x \\sqrt{g }",

    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the metric , the intrinsic curvature , and the covariant derivative in the three - dimensional hyper - surface , respectively .",
    "note that the action   can be regarded as one of the @xmath10 hl theory and each terms are invariant under the foliation - preserving diffeomorphism .",
    "then , the first two terms are referred to as kinetic terms , while the other two are potential terms .",
    "in particular , to study the hl gravity , higher - order potential terms , for instance , @xmath11 , will be taken into account .",
    "but there are almost ten possible terms for @xmath12 case , and the `` detailed balance '' condition can reduce the ten coefficients to three effective ones  @xcite .",
    "of course , it also implies that @xmath13-dimensional renormalization can be reduced to the simpler @xmath14-dimensional renormalization . by the way",
    ", it has been claimed that matter is not uv stable with this condition  @xcite , and the hl theory with the detailed balance condition does not have the minkowski vacuum solution .",
    "on the other hand , there have been interesting studies on the cosmological evolution in the hl gravity based on the phase space analysis  @xcite .",
    "authors showed that the cosmological phase changing from the decelerated expansion to the accelerated expansion is possible assuming the detailed balance condition and the constant equation - of - state parameter .",
    "however , the first accelerated expansion corresponding to the inflationary era has not been discussed .",
    "we believe that there should be such a structure if the hl theory is indeed the uv completion . by the way , the hl gravity itself may be problematic , for instance , counting its degrees of freedom  @xcite , description of the asymptotically flat spacetime  @xcite , and so on .",
    "however , even in spite of these problems , it deserves to study various aspects since it may give some insight to understand the quantum gravity .",
    "so , we would like to investigate whether the smooth cosmological phase transition from the first accelerated expansion in the early universe to the second accelerated expansion over the intermediate decelerated expansion is possible or not .    in section  [ sec : hl : cos ] , we recapitulate the hoava - lifshitz cosmology and define some relevant quantities without the `` detailed balance '' condition . then",
    ", the nonlinear equations of motion will be solved using nonlinear methods in order to study the cosmological behavior in section  [ sec : hl : nl ] . by considering the observational data on density parameters",
    ", we shall plot the phase portrait in section  [ sec : hl : pp ] , and discuss the behavior in the early stage of our universe and its various destiny . if a dark scalar energy density is assumed to be negative",
    ", then the desired first accelerated expansion appears .",
    "moreover , we will show that it can be smoothly connected with the second accelerated expansion .",
    "finally , discussions will be given in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we now consider the anisotropic scaling   between time and space , and then @xmath7 and @xmath15 are invariant while @xmath16 and @xmath17 . requiring that the planck constant is also invariant , @xmath18 , we get @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are energy and mass , respectively . then , the kinetic action in the hoava - lifshitz gravity ( hl ) is naturally given as @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a coupling related to the newton constant @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is an additional dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "note that the original kinetic part of einstein - hilbert action   can be recovered when @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the power - counting renormalizability requires @xmath29  @xcite . from now on",
    ", we will choose @xmath12 for simplicity , then @xmath24 becomes dimensionless because of @xmath30 .",
    "now , the most general potential for @xmath12 can be written as @xmath31 .",

    "the potential terms in eq .   can be recovered when we set @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "then , the fundamental constants can be identified with @xmath35    on the other hand , the ten coefficients can be reduced to three , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , using the detailed balance condition  @xcite : @xmath39 for which the three - dimensional topologically massive gravity action  @xcite is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the gravitational chern - simons term .",
    "however , we will take the general ten coefficients without resort to the detailed balance condition   so that the total action becomes @xmath42 where we introduced a normal matter action @xmath43 which is a perfect fluid source of the energy density @xmath44 and the pressure @xmath45 .",
    "now , we are going to consider the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric , @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the normalized spatial curvature .",

    "apart from the normal matter contribution , the _ additional _ energy - momentum contributions from the potential terms   are explicitly written as @xmath50 similarly to the general relativity , @xmath51 and @xmath52 come from the vacuum energy and the spatial curvature contributions , respectively .",

    "both @xmath53 and @xmath54 depend on the spatial curvature @xmath57 ; in this sense , these might be regarded as corrections to the curvature contribution @xmath52 . the total _",

    "with respect to @xmath6 and plugging it into eq .  , we can naturally obtain the fluid equation @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63 . without loss of generality",
    ", the conservation equation becomes @xmath64 which is valid for each source component , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "ultimately , we want to show the cosmological phase transition from the first accelerated expansion to the second accelerated expansion in terms of the intermediate decelerated expansion , which looks like the overall behavior of our universe . before we get down to this problem",
    ", we are going to exhibit the essence of the linear analysis .",
    "first , rewriting eq .  , we have @xmath66 \\rho_\\text{tot},\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the equation - of - state parameter for the total energy . to describe phase portraits",
    ", we should make change of variables so that we introduce @xmath68 , and @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",

    "note that integrating eq .  , we can find a conservation relation , @xmath72 where the integration constant in the right hand side of was consistently fixed by comparing eq .  .",
    "now , let us eliminate @xmath73 in eq .   using the conservation relation",

    "next , considering an eigenvalue equation of @xmath83 which gives two eigenvalues , the fixed points can be classified as follows  @xcite : they are _ repellers _ if both eigenvalues have positive real part , _ attractors _ if both eigenvalues have negative real part . in particular , they become _ saddles _ if one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative . on the other hand ,",
    "if both eigenvalues are pure imaginary , then they are _",
    "centers_. moreover , they are called _ non - isolated fixed points _ if at least one eigenvalue is zero .",
    "specifically , the jacobian matrix   for @xmath81 , is trivial so that we can find non - isolated fixed points as mentioned earlier , due to the fact that at least one eigenvalue is zero .",

    "we have studied the hl gravity coupled to the matter without the detailed balance condition in order to show the possibility to get the smooth phase transition from the first accelerated expansion corresponding to the early stage of the universe to the second accelerated expansion throughout the intermediate decelerated expansion assuming the energy density for the dark scalar to be negative @xmath119 . in spite of this negative energy contribution ,",
    "the total energy density @xmath120 is positive at any cosmological scale .",
    "note that there have been researches which provide concrete justifications for models with negative density , in particular , a brane universe moving in a curved higher dimensional bulk space  @xcite and a model of dark energy stemming from a fermionic condensate  @xcite .",
    "of course , we can confirm that there is no such a phase transition unless the dark scalar density is assumed to be negative .",
    "for instance , if we take the detailed balance condition , then it simply reduces the additional energy contribution to @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 as seen from fundamental constants   and redefinition of coefficients  . in this case , the first accelerated expansion does not appear , that is the reason why we did not take the detailed balance condition .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that our universe may be oscillatory even with the same density parameters of the current observation , depending on the expansion rate . actually , the expansion rate is related to the total energy density by eq .",
    ", so that small expansion rate @xmath125 corresponds to small @xmath126 for a given scale factor .",
    "on the other hand , it has been well known that if there were @xmath127 e - foldings of inflationary expansion , then the universe was driven to be nearly flat , removing any need for fine - tuned initial conditions .",
    "in addition , the inflationary expansion would have driven the density of magnetic monopoles to be negligible today , explaining their apparent absence .",
    "also , our entire observable portion of the universe would have inflated from an initially small causally connected region , thereby ensuring a high degree of isotropy today .",
    "although our analysis shows that the first accelerated expansion can be obtained by assuming @xmath119 , unfortunately , it should be pointed out that it does not last for 60 e - foldings .",
    "we hope this problem will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "it is interesting to note that there exists a minimum scale @xmath128 obtained from @xmath129 and @xmath130 with the relation @xmath131 .",
    "note that @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath106 , so the universe starts with a certain amount of energy and zero expansion rate , while @xmath134 and @xmath135 for @xmath107 , so the universe starts with zero energy density and a certain expansion rate . for any case , as far as we consider the positive total energy density and the critical energy density , there should be no initial singularity problem because of the existence of the minimum scale .",
    "the final comment is in order .",
    "the energy density and the pressure of the dark scalar which play a crucial role in this work depend on the three terms in the potential  , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "one may think that three terms give rise to kinetic contributions so that they provide the leading spatial dependence in the gravition propagator in the uv region .",
    "what it means is that graviton modes may be unstable .",
    "however , this is not the case since they do not modify the gravition propagator . in general ,",
    "the lowest metric order in curvature tensors and curvature scalars is linear , which means that the three terms are not quadratic in metric . of course ,",
    "such terms which are quadratic in curvature , @xmath139 , @xmath140 in eq .  , will not only add interaction but also modify the propagator ; however , these are irrelvant to our energy density formulae  .",

    "<S> we show that the cosmological phase transition from the first accelerated expansion in the early universe to the second accelerated expansion over the intermediate decelerated expansion is possible in the hl gravity without the `` detailed balance '' condition if the _ dark scalar _ energy density is assumed to be negative . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we obtain various evolutions depending on the scale factor and the expansion rate . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the existence of the minimum scale in connection with the singularity free condition . </S>"
