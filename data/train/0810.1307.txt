    "asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( asep ) are specially convenient for describing general properties of dynamical systems consisting on a collection of many - interacting particles in situations for which the physicochemical characteristics of the components and thus the nature of interactions , need not to be described in details @xcite , review evans . because of this , asep models have been used to study the collective movement of molecular motors that happen at the microtubules within cellular environment @xcite , @xcite , parmeggiani 04 , @xcite .",
    "these are models that can be defined in one-(spacial)-dimension and incorporate the asymmetry of the motion of individual motors .    since the initial proposal pointing out to asep as a possibility to describe the collective dynamics of molecular motors @xcite",
    ", the general interests are mainly focused on the properties of the system at different boundary conditions that allow to make predictions on the stationary currents or on the average motor velocities as function of external loading forces @xcite . also , the effects of motor coordination onto the process of pulling on fluid membranes @xcite have been studied in the literature in the context of discrete asep models with disorder krug , @xcite .",
    "it shall be interesting then to investigate whether this type of description can be extended to describe directly the _ movement of cargo _ driven by motors to understand some of its characteristics observed in experiments .",
    "cargo transport by motors happens at the cellular environment where simple diffusion of vesicles or nutrients is severely limited by the presence of innumerous structures inside the cytoplasm .",
    "besides , it is known that virus particles can take advantage of the existing transport mechanisms using molecular motors as carriers to reach the interior of the cell @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore , by studying the  properties of a model that leads to quantitative predictions on the movement of both motor and cargo might be helpful to understand mechanisms to prevent cell infection and/or to design more efficient drug carriers @xcite .",
    "we have already worked on this problem to investigate the movement of cargo in connection to the short - time behavior of the motor density profile defined in the context of the continuum limit of an asep with periodic boundary conditions @xcite . here , we present an alternative to describe the long - time regime ( steady - state ) of the movement of cargo using a discrete version of the model . the elementary dynamical processes , that is , the processes at the level of individual particles moving on a defined one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions are such to account for two kinds of particles - the motors and the cargoes .",
    "other processes that take place on a lattice and involve two kinds of particles with exclusion have already been explored in the literature to describe diverse phenomena .",
    "the presence of the seminal _ second class particle _ , for example , has been considered to study the microscopic properties of shock fronts exhibited by the system due to density inhomogeneities * *  * * @xcite .",
    "this kind of model can also be used to study the properties of the density profile in the presence of defects @xcite .",
    "the important point we want to notice is that , up to the present , all kinds of particles in the asep models presented in the literature are , in all cases , provided with their own ( intrinsic ) dynamics . as a rule",
    ", an encounter of a particle with another is just supposed to change their original dynamics , or even to impede their movement ( excluded - volume interactions ) , by inducing modifications on the rates of the original stochastic movement .",
    "this is the case , for example of the model cited above containing second class particles .",
    "the elementary processes in this case are    @xmath0    that is , either particles of first @xmath1 and second @xmath2 classes can move by their own if the target neighboring site is unoccupied @xmath3 .",
    "they can also move if interacting with other particles by interchanging occupancy sites as in @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "this is also the case of another asep - like model for which the particles with different dynamics simulate the presence of cars @xmath1 and trucks @xmath2 on a same traffic road @xcite , * *  * * @xcite . for this model ,",
    "the direction of the intrinsic movement of particle @xmath2 is opposed to that in the previous case :    @xmath6    as we want to describe the movement of cargo driven by motors using an asep - like model , we need first to think on possible ways cargo may use the motors to move and up to what extent the presence of cargo can affect the intrinsic dynamics of motors .",
    "the first idea that occurred to us is that the elementary processes in this case should be such to attribute exclusively to one kind of particles - the motors - the ability to move independently , i.e. motors should be able to hop from site to site the only restriction being excluded volume interactions with other motors .",
    "the other kind of particles - the cargoes - should move only if _ assisted by motors_. therefore , the dynamics must , in addition , incorporate explicitly a form for the motor / cargo interactions at this particle level .",
    "we want to examine how such interactions affect the long - time average properties of both cargoes and motors .",
    "based on the above considerations we present in section 2 what we conceived as a minimum model that is able to account explicitly for the dynamics of both cargo and motors expected as a result from their mutual interactions .",
    "this is presented as an asep model  that incorporates a few common characteristics of this biological system , but avoids details of motor / cargo interactions .",
    "it turns out that this model is exactly solvable , that is , the steady - state configurations can be determined . using the matrix approach proposed and developed by derrida , lebowitz , evans , among others review evans , @xcite ,",
    "these states are conveniently represented as products of certain non - commuting matrices which can be used to calculate the properties of interest as the average cargo velocity discussed in sec.3 .",
    "the analytical results obtained in this way are used in section 4 to discuss the phenomenological consequences of the model .",
    "there are a few proposals in the literature to characterize the origins and the role of the components involved in the cargo / motor interactions at a microscopic level * *  * * @xcite .",
    "data suggest that such interactions are mediated by certain proteins - dynactin is the most studied - but apparently there is consensus about their short - range nature as a general characteristic . in terms of the scales involved , this is equivalent to say that such cargo / motor interactions happen by `` direct contact '' among individual components .",
    "moreover , although the experiments indicate that the number of motors attached simultaneously to cargo may be large * *  * * @xcite , there is limited information on the typical times each motor , or group of motors , remains attached to cargo in the course of its movement .",
    "therefore , in building up our model , we avoid details of the processes associated to such microscopic interactions and simply account for these as stochastic processes . we suppose that the time scales associated to the motor / cargo interactions are very short if compared with observation time so the events that happen within such intervals need not to be described as we treat the problem at a larger time scale .",
    "the asep model considered here consists on a collection of @xmath7 motors , and @xmath8 cargoes , referred in the following as particles of type 1 and particles of type 2 respectively , distributed among the @xmath9 sites of a one dimensional cyclic lattice .",
    "each particle occupies a single site and @xmath10 sites remain empty ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the total number of particles of each species is conserved .",
    "we consider the case @xmath11 so that at the steady state , all configurations of the system are equally likely ( ) .",
    "each site is identified by its position on the lattice @xmath12 and occupation at each site is specified by a corresponding site variable @xmath13 that assumes integer values @xmath14 or @xmath15 , if the site is empty ( @xmath16 ) , occupied by a motor ( @xmath17 ) , or occupied by cargo ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "a state @xmath18 of the system is specified by the set @xmath19 @xmath20 as usual , in this kind of description the stochastic dynamics is defined through a poissonian process taking place at the lattice such that at each time interval @xmath21 , a pair of consecutive sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 is selected at random and the system is updated depending on whether it is possible to exchange particles between these two sites .",
    "we choose the following possibilities @xmath24where the pair of sites @xmath25 is being represented by the values assumed by the variables @xmath26 according to these rules a cargo is allowed to move only if  `` assisted ''  by a motor at a neighbor site .",
    "we see this as a possibility to describe the fact that the movement of cargo is conditioned to that of motors , as observed in real systems . at this level of description",
    "one must consider that if motors affect the movement of cargo then cargo must have influence on the movement of motors . in the present model",
    "this is incorporated into the dynamics ( [ dynamics ] ) both explicitly , by the processes that involve cargo / motor exchanging positions in both directions and implicitly , by modifying the motors hopping rates that assume distinct values depending whether a jump occurs towards an empty site or by interchanging position with particle 2 .    here , we are concerned with the kinematics of the cargo at long - time regimes . for this",
    ", we use the matrix - approach @xcite , * *  * * review evans *  * to represent any configurations of the system of @xmath27 sites by a product of @xmath9 matrices , so that the probability of occurrence of a particular configuration @xmath18 is given by@xmath28where the kronecker delta symbols select the correct occupancy and @xmath29is the normalization .",
    "the sum extends over all allowed configurations for which @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the product above , site @xmath22 is represented by matrix @xmath32 if it is occupied  by a motor ( particle 1 ) , by matrix @xmath33 if it is occupied by the cargo ( particle 2 ) or by matrix @xmath34 if it is empty ( not - occupied ) .    in the stationary state ,",
    "the probabilities @xmath35 for all configurations @xmath18 satisfy the condition @xcite:@xmath36where @xmath37 is the rate at which the exchange of particles occur between neighboring sites so that all nonzero terms in the above sum are those for which configurations @xmath18 and @xmath38 differ from each other at most by the occupancy of a pair of sites .    as an example",
    ", we consider for @xmath39 , @xmath11 , @xmath40 the following configuration @xmath41 .",
    "there is just one way to leave this configuration that is through the process : @xmath42 with @xmath43 on the other hand , there are two ways to reach this configuration , either by exchanging particle positions ( i ) by the process @xmath44 in configuration @xmath45 with @xmath46 or ( ii ) by the process @xmath47 in configuration @xmath48 with @xmath49 so , in this case , equation ( [ mestra ] ) reads:@xmath50    as a general rule , the main difficulty in using this method to determine the probabilities @xmath35 for each configuration @xmath18 is to find the algebra , if any , that must be satisfied by the corresponding matrices of a given asep model in order to satisfy condition ( [ mestra ] ) for a given dynamics as in ( [ dynamics])@xmath51 in the present case , we conjecture that if @xmath52 and @xmath34 are such that@xmath53for @xmath54then , eq .",
    "( [ mestra ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this can be tested using explicit examples , as the one considered in ( [ exemplo1 ] ) . using ( [ algebra ] ) to evaluate the traces",
    ", one can easily check that the identity holds trivially . in the following , we study properties of this model that are of interest for examining the consequences of the model regarding the characteristics of cargo movement .",
    "for @xmath11 i.e. just one cargo , in the presence of @xmath7 motors distributed along a cyclic lattice of @xmath9 sites , we consider @xmath55 to ensure that at least one site in the system remains empty . in this case , the average cargo velocity @xmath56 at steady state is expressed as@xmath57where the sums in the numerator extends over all configurations of @xmath58 motors distributed among @xmath59 sites .",
    "the first sum in the rhs accounts for all configurations in which the site at the immediate right of cargo is occupied by a motor .",
    "the second sum accounts for all configurations in which there is a motor at immediate left of cargo at a lattice position .",
    "notice that due to the invariance of the trace the normalization factor @xmath60 can be written as @xmath61where the sum extends over all configurations of @xmath7 motors distributed among @xmath62 sites .    in order to make reference to",
    "the above traces over products of matrices , it is convenient to introduce the functions @xmath63 to indicate the configurations having the n - uple @xmath64 fixed ,  the corresponding sites occupied by particles or holes assigned by the variables @xmath65 using these definitions , we write@xmath66where@xmath67for @xmath68 and analogous definitions for @xmath69 and @xmath70 alternatively , due to the cyclic property of the trace , @xmath60 can also be calculated from @xmath71these two expressions ( [ norma 3 ] ) and ( [ norma 4 ] ) are equivalent and both will be used below , at convenience .",
    "notice that we can rewrite the sum over configurations in @xmath72 as @xmath73where the first ( second ) sum on the rhs extends over all configurations of @xmath58 motors with the triplet @xmath74 fixed @xmath75 motors with the triplet @xmath76 fixed ) distributed among @xmath77 lattice sites . making use of the decompositions in ( [ norma 3 ] ) and ( [ w20 ] ) ,",

    "( [ norma 4 ] ) .    a convenient way to perform the calculations indicated above is to replace the sums over site variables @xmath79 by sums over blocks defined by the integers @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82  ( see for example , ref.@xcite ) . in this representation , @xmath83with @xmath84@xmath85with @xmath86@xmath87with @xmath88 and @xmath84@xmath89with @xmath88 and @xmath86    from the algebra in ( [ algebra ] ) , it follows that @xmath90 this identity is needed in the evaluation of the above traces for general configurations of the variables @xmath79 .",
    "the results are@xmath91notice that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are functions of the size @xmath94 of the block , i.e. of the number of particles of type @xmath17 ( motors ) that precede particle @xmath15 ( cargo ) . because of this , the evaluation of the respective sums over @xmath81 and @xmath80 in configurations of the type @xmath92 ( or @xmath93)@xmath95 excluding @xmath96 is equivalent to account for the number of ways for distributing @xmath97 motors into @xmath98 ( or into @xmath99 ) sites .",
    "the factor @xmath15 in the first case comes from the exclusion of two sites from the total : one occupied by the cargo and another that must remain empty to define the limits of the cluster of @xmath94 motors behind the cargo .",
    "then , @xmath100and@xmath101    @xmath102 and @xmath103 correspond to configurations that do not present motors behind the cargo . in the sum over configurations of the type @xmath102",
    "one must account for the number of ways to distribute @xmath7 motors into @xmath59 sites ( from the total of @xmath9 sites , there must be excluded @xmath15 , one to fix the cargo and the other to fix an empty site ) .",
    "then , @xmath104 and * *  * * @xmath105    we now proceed by computing the sum over integer @xmath106 in ( [ sum 2 w12 ] ) and ( [ sum 2 w120 ] ) .",
    "our intention is to obtain an expression for the average velocity @xmath56 of cargo in the limit for which both the number of sites and the number of motors ( which are conserved by the dynamics ) are taken very large , that is @xmath107 and @xmath108 these limits are supposed to be taken in such a way to ensure that the ratio between these two quantities @xmath109converges to a defined density of motors @xmath110 , such that @xmath111 these same limits have already been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the average velocity of trucks in a related traffic problem . here",
    ", we proceed along the same lines sketched by these authors .",
    "first , we use stirling formula @xmath112 for very large @xmath9 , to approximate the combinatorial coefficients in ( [ sum 2 w02 ] ) and ( [ sum 2 w020 ] ) . it results@xmath113}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n\\rho ( 1-\\rho ) } } \\label{c02}\\]]and@xmath114}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n\\rho ( 1-\\rho ) } } \\label{c020}\\]]in order to evaluate the sums @xmath115 and @xmath116 in ( [ sum 2 w12 ] ) and ( [ sum 2 w120 ] ) , we follow the procedure used in ref.@xcite . there , sums involving factorials of this kind are approximated by integrals and the asymptotic regimes are obtained using laplace s method @xcite . considering then the limit of very large systems and defining @xmath117 , we calculate @xmath118where we have defined the function @xmath119 of a single variable @xmath120 as @xmath121and used the fact that in the specified limit , the sum in @xmath106 converges to the integral as @xmath122 .    now observe that @xmath119 has a maximum at@xmath123so in order to apply laplace s method in the present case , one must distinguish between two possibilities , namely    * if @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) then , @xmath126",

    "in this case @xmath127 does not belong to the integration interval .",
    "since @xmath119 is a monotone decreasing function of @xmath132 the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand at @xmath133 , and application of laplace s method results @xmath134   \\label{s1laplace 2}\\ ] ]    analogously , the asymptotic behavior of the sum @xmath116 ( [ sum 2 w120 ] ) must be analyzed according to the range of @xmath135 :    * if @xmath124 @xmath136 then @xmath137 \\label{s2   laplace 1}\\]]or * if @xmath138either @xmath125 or @xmath139 then @xmath140   \\label{s2   laplace 2}\\ ] ]    from these results , one concludes that if @xmath124 then @xmath141both @xmath142 and @xmath116 are the dominant factors in the expression for @xmath56 both in the numerator and in the denominator .",

    "the aim of the present work is to study the consequences of introducing cargo into certain lattice models where there is also present a set of biased molecular motors interacting through excluded - volume interactions .",
    "we consider an asep - like model specially designed to account for both kinds of particles .",
    "therefore , the model includes an assumption about the stochastic nature of the movement of cargo and its dependence on the dynamics of motors . to our knowledge , this is the first attempt to include in the same framework , at the particle level , the effects on the movement of motors due to the presence of cargo and vice - versa .",
    "we look for the probabilities associated to the configurations of the system at the stationary state which are represented by products of certain noncomuting matrices @xcite . using this representation ,",
    "we were able to make quantitative predictions on the average properties that characterize the movement of cargo .",
    "we focus on the computation of the average velocity of cargo @xmath56 whose behavior predicted by the model suggests that the system displays a phase transition under variation of the parameters .",
    "2 shows @xmath56 plotted according to the results in eqs .",
    "( [ v maior xrho ] ) and ( [ v menor xrho ] ) as a function of @xmath145 at different values of @xmath146 for fixed @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "observe that for sufficiently high values of @xmath149 the function @xmath56 displays a change in its behavior at values of @xmath110 for which @xmath150 as @xmath56 becomes independent of@xmath141",
    "@xmath110 .    in order to interpret these results",
    ", it shall be easier first to discuss on the kind of movement one would expect for cargo in the context of the considered asep .",
    "the mechanisms in ( [ dynamics ] ) that define its elementary movements within each unit interval of time correspond to those of exchanging positions with a neighbor motor .",
    "the assigned hopping rates are such to promote , at a first moment , an accumulation of motors at one side ( at the left side ) of the cargo .",
    "then cargo would be able to move backwards by exchanging position with these accumulated motors . by doing this ,",
    "the motors end up transposed to the cargo s front . because motors are assigned with an intrinsic dynamics - they move preferentially to the right - these motors at cargo s front will tend to disperse . since the vesicle depends on such clusters of motors to develop a measurable velocity , it ends up moving mostly due to the motors accumulated at its back .",
    "the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath110 in fig.2 confirms these expectations showing that @xmath56 assumes only negative values , at all ranges of parameters .",
    "one could expect , in principle , that at high values of @xmath110 there would be a balance between a tendency for maintenance of motors in front of the cargo , as excluded - volume become more important and eventually would be responsible for expressive motor accumulation at cargo s front .",
    "so , in principle , one could think that for sufficient high values of @xmath149 there would be a chance for the cargo to develop a macroscopic movement towards the plus end of the microtubule , that is to the forward direction as well , @xmath56 eventually displaying positive values  for @xmath151 according to the results , however , this does not happen either .",
    "the behavior @xmath141of @xmath152 predicted for high values of @xmath110 can be * *  * * understood by recognizing the formation of an  `` infinite '' ( macroscopic ) cluster of motors behind the cargo with which it can always exchange positions .",
    "the formation of such infinite cluster  would be a consequence of the phase transition ( of condensation type ) predicted for this system .",
    "the average velocity in this region of density becomes constant probably due to the uniformity of motor distribution along this cluster .",
    "we can then summarize these results by saying  that the single cargo in this system of many motors develops , a backwards movement at any value of the hopping rates @xmath153 and @xmath147 , or density @xmath154 the magnitude of such velocity , however , is highly dependent on @xmath110 and becomes constant at such values of @xmath110 greater than a critical value @xmath155 it would be interesting then to test these predictions using data from experiment _ in vivo _ by monitoring the behavior of the motor density as cargo moves .    actually , data from drosophila embryos @xcite , @xcite * *  * * show that cargo velocity presents distinct behaviors depending on the stage of embryo development .",
    "it remains to investigate whether these changes could be associated to corresponding changes in the density of motors available at each of these stages . to our knowledge , there is limited information about the possible changes on the motor distribution along the microtubules due to the movement of cargo .",
    "the present study suggests that any investigation in this direction might be relevant to find ways to control cargo movement .",
