    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) in strongly correlated systems play an important rle in modern condensed matter physics . in problems ranging from high temperature superconductivity to cold atomic gases , dramatic changes in the ground state and physical response",
    "may often accompany relatively small changes in the doping , the interaction strength , or other system parameters.@xcite with the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates,@xcite quantum phase transitions between mott - insulators ( mis ) and superfluids ( sfs ) or superconductors , have been at the forefront of this intense scrutiny .",
    "more recently , remarkable advances in cold atomic gases , have allowed the observation of such transitions in systems of bosonic atoms.@xcite an important stimulus for these studies , is that the sf - mi transition separates two of the most fascinating phases of highly correlated matter .",
    "the superfluid reveals the importance of phase coherence on the macroscopic scale , and the mott - insulator the importance of strong interactions .",
    "the transition between the two clearly involves an interplay between strong interactions and strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "such strongly correlated regimes are notoriously difficult to analyze theoretically , and shedding light on this enigmatic transition remains challenging .",
    "in this work , we focus on the magnetothermoelectric response in the vicinity of such quantum critical points ( qcps ) .",
    "our motivation for this , and our previous work,@xcite arose in connection with high temperature superconductivity , where experiments indicate strong superconducting fluctuations in a broad range of temperatures above @xmath0.@xcite these signatures appear in both thermodynamics and transport measurements performed in magnetic fields , and include enhanced diamagnetism,@xcite and a strong nernst signal.@xcite the nernst response is the transverse electric field induced by a thermal gradient in a magnetic field , and therefore hinges on the interplay of several different probes .",
    "although a tremendous amount of theoretical progress has been made in various regions of the phase diagram,@xcite much less was known about the complete magnetothermoelectric response in the vicinity of such qcps.@xcite in view of the enhanced fluctuations , and the prospect of universal results , we advocated examining this problem at a simple , but rather generic sf - mi transition in the xy universality class@xcite  see fig  [ fig : sfmikt ] .",
    "somewhat more ambitiously , we set out with a view to describe the full complement of magnetothermoelectric response coefficients .     dimensions , as tuned by a control parameter @xmath1 , such as film thickness or doping .",
    "the diagram shows the finite temperature 2d kosterlitz  thouless transition , and the crossover between the mott insulator and the normal state .",
    "we examine the universal finite temperature magnetothermoelectric response in the vicinity of the ( particle  hole symmetric ) @xmath2 xy qpt , as shown by the vertical arrow.,width=226 ]    our strategy@xcite is to focus on the particle ",
    "hole symmetric transitions in the ubiquitous bose  hubbard model .",
    "this model has a distinguished history , and provides a paradigmatic example of a sf - mi quantum phase transition.@xcite while it arose primarily in connection with bosonic models of strongly correlated _ electron _",
    "systems , where the bosons are to be thought of as cooper pairs , it has since been cleanly realized in ground breaking experiments in cold atomic bose gases.@xcite although not directly linked to a fermionic high temperature superconductor ( with a d - wave order parameter and nodal quasiparticles ) the simplicity of the bose  hubbard model is appealing . amongst its many virtues",
    ", it admits a description as a quantum landau ",
    "ginzburg theory ( or abelian higgs model ) and so it naturally embraces @xmath3 phase fluctuations .",
    "such fluctuations have long been argued to play an important rle in high temperature superconductors.@xcite more recently , the finite temperature _ classical fluctuations _ of the kosterlitz  thouless@xcite transition have been argued to influence their diamagnetic response.@xcite in this work we focus on the vicinity of the qcp , and study the impact of _ quantum critical fluctuations _ on the fundamental transport coefficients , and other physical response functions  see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfmikt ] .",
    "in contrast to other approaches , which tackle related problems from the superfluid side , and thus in terms of vortices , it is quite natural to examine the critical region in terms of particle  hole excitations of the mott insulator .",
    "although dual vortex formulations are possible , we do not pursue this complementary approach here .    from a condensed matter perspective ,",
    "our primary interests are in the charge and thermal transport , and the thermodynamic response in the vicinity of the qcp .",
    "this critical point is of course well studied and there is a vast literature on its zero field properties which we do not attempt to review . in order to place our work in context,@xcite",
    "we simply recollect the most recent precursors pertaining to single field _ transport _",
    "measurements in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "it was recognized in early works that the electrical conductivity is a finite universal multiple of @xmath4.@xcite interactions at the fixed point are essential in order to render this finite , as opposed to a more conventional , non - interacting single carrier drude peak .",
    "more specifically , this may be traced to collisions between counter propagating particles and holes , and in general requires a finite frequency , and finite temperature , hydrodynamic treatment of the problem.@xcite in contrast , it was well understood that the thermal conductivity _ diverges _ at the clean interacting fixed point ; @xcite in the presence of a thermal gradient , particle and hole excitations move in the _ same _ direction , and the collision mechanism is unable to render this quantity finite . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", a finite thermal response therefore requires the introduction of impurities , or other forms of energy relaxation.@xcite    as we noted in our previous work,@xcite this circumstance is changed markedly in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "although the dc hall conductivity vanishes on symmetry grounds at the particle - hole symmetric point , the application of a magnetic field opens up the possibility of non - vanishing thermoelectric response coefficients , _ even in the absence of impurities , or other forms of scattering_. for this reason , we confined ourselves to the clean case , in order to better expose the main universal results .",
    "this is not a serious limitation , since results in the presence of impurities may be obtained from the finite frequency behavior of the clean system , provided it s not driven to a new non - trivial fixed point .",
    "the general problem one is interested in , is thus to apply various combinations of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , possibly at finite frequency , and to measure the associated response coefficients . in view of the conceptual importance of the bose  hubbard model and the xy universality class , we present a variety of approaches to the general magnetothermoelectric response .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section [ scaling ] we begin with a general discussion of scaling close to a qcp .",
    "this overview is relevant to both bosonic and fermionic systems in arbitrary dimension , and thus helps to correlate the more detailed , model specific results we shall present . in section [ ft ]",
    "we recall the field theory approach to the superfluid ",
    "insulator transition in the bose  hubbard model , and the simplifications at the particle - hole symmetric point . in section",
    "[ be ] we describe the boltzmann approach to quantum critical transport.@xcite in sections [ efr ] , [ tgr ] and [ mfr ] , we present a brief overview of the properties in electric fields , magnetic fields , and temperature gradients taken _ separately_. in section [ sect : crossed ] we examine the behavior in combined crossed electric and magnetic fields , and discuss two distinct regimes of behavior .",
    "we approach this problem in several different ways , including entropy transport , lorentz invariance , and a linear response analysis of the qbe . in section [",
    "sect : tgm ] we examine the behavior in the presence of a temperature gradient and a magnetic field , and once again discuss two regimes .",
    "we verify that the onsager relations are satisfied and obtain a non - vanishing thermal conductivity .",
    "we conclude in section [ sect : conc ] and provide several technical appendices .    whilst this longer manuscript was under construction , elegant extensions of this work appeared which also include the effects of impurities and particle - hole symmetry breaking at relativistic qcps.@xcite these reveal important links between the transport coefficients , and develop connections to the high energy community.@xcite applications to other gapless systems such as graphene",
    "have also been investigated.@xcite",
    "as usual , the approach to a continuous phase transition is accompanied by a divergent correlation length , @xmath8 , and a divergent correlation time , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the so - called dynamical exponent .",
    "close to the transition , dependence on the microscopic details drops out , and non - trivial scaling relations between physical observables and the system parameters may be obtained . in the case of a _",
    "phase transition , where the microscopic energy scale is tuned to zero , the only relevant energy scale in the problem is the temperature , @xmath11 . in this case , the divergent correlation time is given by @xmath12 where we set , @xmath13 , for simplicity ; see for example the review @xcite for more details .",
    "this diverging time scale is accompanied by a divergent correlation length @xmath14 where a non - trivial dynamical exponent , @xmath10 , reflects the potential for disparity in the temporal and static correlations . throughout this work",
    "will be interested in the magnetic , electrical and thermal response in the vicinity of a qcp . here , we examine the general consequences which follow from simple , yet powerful , scaling ideas . as exemplified by measurements on quantum hall systems ,",
    "such considerations are able to correlate a wide variety of different physical probes , yet are crucially independent of the microscopic approach employed.@xcite    the space - time dimensions of the electric and heat currents contribute to the overall temperature dependence : @xmath15 & \\sim { \\rm time}^{-1}{\\rm length}^{-(d-1 ) } \\sim t^{1+(d-1)/z } , \\label{dimelcur}\\\\ [ j_h ] & \\sim { \\rm time}^{-2}{\\rm length}^{-(d-1)}\\sim t^{2+(d-1)/z}.   \\label{dimhcur}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general , we are also interested in the dependence of these currents on the measuring frequency and the external fields , and it is temperature against which these are compared .",
    "having pinned the overall dimensions , these external fields will enter via dimensionless ratios involving the temperature.@xcite using the defining relations , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 & \\sim   { \\rm length}^{-1}{\\rm time}^{-1}\\sim t^{1 + 1/z } , \\\\ [ { \\bf b } ] & \\sim { \\rm length}^{-2}\\sim t^{2/z},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19={\\rm length}^{-1}$ ] . in this way we arrive at the following scaling forms , valid in arbitrary dimension and for generic dynamical exponent : @xmath20 @xmath21 where , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are universality class dependent scaling functions .",
    "one may readily incorporate additional perturbations in a similar fashion . as we discuss in section [ mfr ]",
    ", similar considerations also apply to thermodynamic quantities obtained from the scaling form for the free energy .",
    "we emphasize that our only assumption in deriving these scaling forms is proximity to a qcp .",
    "in particular , they are independent of the statistics of the underlying carriers , and are equally valid for both bosonic and fermionic systems .",
    "these expressions are invaluable as they enable one to confirm , and sometimes infer , the field and temperature dependence of the transport coefficients .",
    "perhaps more importantly , they also allow one to correlate a large number of distinct scenarios and probes , without lengthy or sophisticated computations .",
    "for example , as we will discuss in section [ efr ] , in the absence of an applied magnetic field , or temperature gradient , linear response in @xmath5 immediately yields @xmath24 the general dependence of the ac conductivity on frequency and temperature is therefore easily read off.@xcite of course , in order to pin the precise functional dependence on these variables , explicit calculations of the scaling functions are necessary , and we turn our attention to this problem below .",
    "most crucially , at low frequencies , @xmath25 , collisions at the fixed point necessitate a hydrodynamic , or quantum boltzmann treatment of the critical regime.@xcite for simplicity , we consider the , @xmath26 , relativistic field theory approach to the ( particle - hole symmetric ) sf - mi transition in the bose  hubbard model , but our interests , and overall approach are clearly broader .",
    "the bose  hubbard model has received considerable attention in recent years,@xcite and describes bosons hopping on a lattice with amplitude @xmath27 , and interacting via a short range repulsive interaction @xmath28 : @xmath29 the bose creation and annihilation operators satisfy the usual commutation relations , @xmath30=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , where @xmath31 , is the number of bosons at site @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the chemical potential . in the context of a josephson array or superconductor ,",
    "the bosons represent cooper pairs of charge @xmath34 , tunnelling between superconducting regions . in general , one may also include the effects of disorder and long range interactions into such a model , but here we shall concentrate on the simplest case ( [ bh ] ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the bose ",
    "hubbard model is well established , and exhibits both superfluid and mott insulating regions,@xcite the latter occurring for strong enough repulsive interactions  see fig.[fig : bhlobes ] . as a function of the chemical potential , @xmath33 ,",
    "this model exhibits a series of mott insulating `` lobes '' where the density of bosons is pinned to successive integers . at a given point within the mott lobes , the energy cost for producing particle ( or hole )",
    "excitations is measured by the vertical displacement to the upper ( or lower ) phase boundary . at the tips of these lobes ,",
    "the energy cost to producing particle  hole excitations vanishes , and the model is particle  hole symmetric .",
    "in addition , the density remains constant as one enters the superfluid phase along a trajectory of constant chemical potential , passing through this apex . in the vicinity of these points ,",
    "the sf - mi transition is described by the relativistic action of an interacting complex scalar field @xmath35 , @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the number of spatial dimensions of the original bose  hubbard model ( [ bh ] ) , and the mass parameter , @xmath39 , is set by the temperature .",
    "this is nothing but a relativistic , quantum landau ",
    "ginzburg action for the superconducting order parameter , @xmath35 , and its associated fluctuations .",
    "it therefore represent a useful starting point to unravel the more general problem of phase fluctuations at sf - mi transitions .",
    "away from these particle  hole symmetric points , the density changes as one enters the superfluid phase , and the action picks up an additional term , linear in the time derivative .",
    "correspondingly , the dynamical exponent changes from @xmath26 to @xmath40 ; see for example ref  . here , we will focus on the case with @xmath26 , since it will allow us to employ the powerful machinery of relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "more general results , for arbitrary @xmath10 , may be obtained by appealing to the general scaling arguments outlined in section [ scaling ] .",
    "a convenient and physically intuitive way to think about this problem , at leading order in the epsilon expansion , is by means of the quantum boltzmann approach to quantum critical transport.@xcite in this framework we may regard the model ( [ slg ] ) as a gas of particle  hole excitations of the mott insulator .",
    "the quantum boltzmann equation ( qbe ) emerges at lowest order in the epsilon expansion and describes the impact of weak scattering ( as controlled by epsilon ) on these quasiparticles at the gaussian fixed point .",
    "it takes the form of a nonlinear integro - differential equation for the momentum space distribution functions , @xmath41 , of such particle and hole excitations @xmath42 , \\label{qbe}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for simplicity",
    "we consider a spatially homogeneous system in uniform external fields .",
    "the collision term represents scattering between these excitations , and most crucially , incorporates the nonlinear interaction of the landau ",
    "ginzburg field theory ( [ slg ] ) and the associated critical fluctuations:@xcite @xmath45 where scattering out of state @xmath46 is given by @xmath47[1 + { f}_\\mp({\\bf k}_3 ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + f_\\pm({\\bf k})f_\\pm({\\bf k}_1)[1+{f}_\\pm({\\bf k}_2)][1+{f}_\\pm({\\bf k}_3)],\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we have suppressed the explicit time dependence of the distribution functions . scattering in to state @xmath46 follows by interchanging @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the structure of the collision term ( [ col ] ) is readily seen by using fermi s golden rule , and represents the leading term in the @xmath50-expansion of the associated keldysh field theory.@xcite the factors of @xmath51 remind us that we are dealing with a system of bosons in this example . as in standard treatments of @xmath52 theory ,",
    "it is convenient to access the non - trivial fixed point by means of an epsilon expansion around the upper critical dimension.@xcite at the wilson  fisher fixed point , where the renormalized mass vanishes , the bare couplings must be tuned to the values @xcite @xmath53 where our spatial dimensionality is given by @xmath54 ; since we are primarily interested in two spatial dimensions , we shall set @xmath55 , at the end of any calculations .",
    "the collision term ( [ col ] ) is therefore proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "as we shall see , the leading order epsilon expansion is illuminating both from a quantitative numerical perspective , and also in its ability to expose the external field and temperature dependence of physical quantities .",
    "this semiclassical approach is formally justified within the epsilon expansion where , at the temperatures of interest , the mean free path is much longer than the thermal de broglie wavelength and the mean interparticle spacing .",
    "further information on the relativistic qbe,@xcite and applications to the quark gluon plasma , may also be found in the literature.@xcite    in this boltzmann representation , the @xmath3 electric current of the field theory ( [ slg ] ) takes the form @xmath57 , \\label{bolel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the heat current is given ( in linear response ) by @xmath58 . \\label{bolheat}\\ ] ] here , we use @xmath46 to label the momentum and not wavevector ; the dimensions of the currents are @xmath59=cm^{-(d-1)}s^{-1}$ ] and @xmath60=jm^{-(d-1)}s^{-1}$ ] . in this representation , the field theory conservation laws are related by appropriate momentum space integrals ( or moments ) of the qbe .",
    "the strategy is thus the same as in any application of the boltzmann equation .",
    "we should solve the appropriate qbe for the non - equilibrium distribution function(s ) , and then compute the associated transport currents .",
    "we may then extract the fundamental transport coefficients defined via @xmath61 where @xmath62 is required by the onsager relations,@xcite and we denote the response to a temperature gradient by an overbar in order to distinguish it from the thermal conductivity defined in the absence of a particle current . ) and ( [ bolheat ] ) , and the _ transport _ currents ( [ tcoeffs ] ) , due to the presence of magnetization currents.@xcite this issue is circumvented in conventional boltzmann approaches to transport in magnetic fields which do not include magnetization corrections to the distribution function . ]",
    "knowledge of the transport coefficients is particularly useful since they allow one to correlate a wide variety of different measurements .",
    "for example , the nernst coefficient , @xmath63 , is the transverse electric field generated under open circuit conditions by a temperature gradient and a magnetic field . imposing , @xmath64 , on equation ( [ tcoeffs ] ) one may relate this _ open circuit _",
    "measurement to the more primitive _ transport _ coefficients by@xcite @xmath65 at the particle ",
    "hole symmetric point we have chosen to focus on , the hall coefficient , @xmath66 , vanishes and this may be reduced to @xmath67 such an approximate reduction may also occur in situations where @xmath68 . we see that the transverse thermoelectric response , @xmath69 , is central to a discussion of the nernst response .",
    "we shall examine this quantity in detail from several different perspectives , beginning in section [ sect : crossed ]",
    ". we shall also discuss the behavior of the other transport coefficients , including the thermal conductivity , @xmath70 .",
    "before embarking on a detailed discussion of the general magnetothermoelectric response , it is instructive to recall the main known results pertaining to single field measurements.@xcite as we discussed in section [ scaling ] , in the absence of any applied temperature gradients or magnetic fields , one expects the linear response electric current to behave as @xmath71 the corresponding conductivity therefore reads @xmath72 for @xmath26 , this is borne out by the direct boltzmann calculations of damle and sachdev.@xcite indeed , the nontrivial scaling ( [ sigscale ] ) as a function of @xmath73 was an important catalyst for their boltzmann treatment ; in general the limits @xmath74 and @xmath75 do not commute and @xmath76 .",
    "as such the dc response at finite temperature differs from that obtained at zero temperature .",
    "the universal scaling function , @xmath77 , may be computed numerically in the low frequency hydrodynamic regime by means of the qbe ( [ qbe ] ) , and at zero frequency one obtains@xcite @xmath78 in @xmath79 , where @xmath55 , the dc conductivity is a universal multiple of @xmath4 : @xmath80 this result is clearly appealing , and is remarkably close to both the self - dual value,@xcite @xmath81 , and to a number of early experiments on thin films.@xcite more generally , the order of limits is also relevant to the electric field itself .",
    "a discussion of the non - commutativity of @xmath82 , and the associated non - linear response , may be found in refs .  .",
    "it is worth noting that the result ( [ dssig ] ) is _ singular _ in the small parameter @xmath50 .",
    "this is a direct reflection of the proximity to the gaussian fixed point , and that collisions must overcome the conventional drude response for a single non - interacting carrier .",
    "this is possible in this two carrier system because electric current relaxation does not violate momentum conservation.@xcite a steady state with a finite conductivity is therefore established .",
    "as we shall see , the specific leading order dependence on @xmath50 is intimately tied to the physical quantity under consideration .",
    "for example , in section [ sect : crossed ] we shall demonstrate that the leading order contribution to @xmath69 is _ regular _ in the epsilon expansion . to leading order , one may therefore drop the @xmath83 collision term in the qbe and consider bosons of mass @xmath84 moving under the action of the applied fields .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the case considered by damle and sachdev,@xcite where the collision term was crucial in order to render the electrical conductivity finite and proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "nonetheless , as we shall discuss below , the collision term is central to a better understanding of the thermal conductivity in the drift regime . here",
    "the leading order contribution begins at @xmath86 and is _ inversely _ related to the electrical conductivity . for uniformity of presentation",
    "we shall include the collision term throughout , and simplify when it is appropriate .",
    "in view of the finite dc electrical conductivity discussed above , it is tempting to think that the system might also support a finite thermal conductivity , in the spirit of a conventional wiedemann  franz relation .",
    "a little reflection reveals that this is _ not _ the case however , and that the thermal conductivity in fact diverges in the clean system.@xcite a simple way to see this is to note that under the action of the thermal gradient , particles and holes move in the _ same _ direction . as such , relaxation of the corresponding heat current requires _ energy",
    "_ relaxation , which is not contained in either the original model ( [ slg ] ) or the boltzmann description ( [ qbe ] ) .",
    "( this is in contrast to the electrical conductivity , where particles and holes move in _ opposite _ directions , with no net momentum .",
    "collisions are highly effective in limiting the electrical current , without violating the conservation laws.@xcite ) it follows that the divergence of the thermal conductivity is intimately tied to the conservation of the energy momentum tensor,@xcite in much the same way as happens in low - dimensional integrable systems.@xcite as we shall discuss below , this conservation argument no longer applies in the presence of a magnetic field.@xcite by minimally coupling the field theory ( [ slg ] ) to a magnetic field , the conservation law is modified . as such , in the presence of a magnetic field , a non - vanishing thermoelectric tensor and thermal conductivity may be supported , _ even in the clean homogeneous system_.@xcite impurities and other scattering mechanisms such as umklapp processes , may of course render these quantities finite also , but in the first instance , it is clearly essential to understand the universal results pertaining to the clean homogeneous system . before embarking on a general discussion of the interplay between a magnetic field and other probes and response functions , let us examine the response to a magnetic field alone .",
    "in view of the interest in fluctuation diamagnetism@xcite it is instructive to investigate the response to a magnetic field alone . recalling our scaling arguments from section [ scaling ] , in the vicinity of a qcp , the only relevant energy scale against which to compare the magnetic field is the temperature . in the absence of electrical and thermal gradients",
    ", we therefore expect the free energy density to scale as@xcite @xmath87 here we have used the fact that the correlation length , @xmath8 , diverges with the correlation time , @xmath88 , according to @xmath89 , and so the prefactor is an energy density .",
    "in addition , we have used the fact that @xmath90\\sim 1/l^2\\sim t^{2/z}$ ] , as follows from our discussion in section [ scaling ] . in weak magnetic fields , @xmath91",
    ", we may expand this in powers of @xmath6 : @xmath92 here we assume that symmetry under reversal of the magnetic field ensures that only even powers of @xmath6 appear in the weak field expansion of the scaling function @xmath93 .",
    "it follows that the linear response magnetization scales as@xcite @xmath94 this is consistent with a finite temperature , diagrammatic kubo calculation of the magnetic susceptibility of a charged scalar field , with @xmath95 and @xmath26 . on the other hand , in strong magnetic fields , @xmath96 ,",
    "it is natural to expand this in a power series in temperature , and recast the scaling relation ( [ freescal ] ) in the form @xmath97 in strong fields , or low temperatures , @xmath96 , we thus expect @xmath98 in the relativistic problem , this yields the strong field behavior , @xmath99 , in @xmath79 , and @xmath100 , in @xmath101 . broadly speaking ,",
    "this non - trivial field dependence is a reflection of the relativistic landau level spectrum , where @xmath102 .",
    "this is suggested on dimensional grounds by equation ( [ freescal ] ) for @xmath26 , and is borne out in a direct computation of the partition function of a free massive relativistic charged scalar field.@xcite these considerations are also compatible with elegant and highly non - trivial results obtained in the early days of quantum electrodynamics on vacuum polarization and pair production;@xcite see for example ref .",
    "for a recent review of heisenberg  euler effective lagrangians in both spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics . contributions to the free energy are eliminated in these works by a renormalization of the electric charge associated with the maxwell term . ]",
    "these detailed studies require ultraviolet regularization and yield an additional logarithm at strong magnetic fields , so that @xmath103 in @xmath101 .",
    "although this is not captured by the simple scaling arguments , it is intimately connected to the vacuum screening properties of the field theory via the renormalization group beta function .    in this section",
    "we have discussed the distinct field regimes of the static magnetic response . in the subsequent discussion",
    ", we shall see how such regime divisions also emerge in the transport properties .",
    "in many respects this is rather natural , since the dynamics and statics are intimately related at qcps.@xcite",
    "in order to understand the quantum critical transport in combined @xmath104 and @xmath105 fields , it is instructive to recall the motion of a _ single _ relativistic particle in crossed electric and magnetic fields.@xcite this will provide significant orientation for the more general _ interacting _ field theory.@xcite the most important feature is that the motion of a single charged particle is qualitatively different depending on whether , @xmath106 , or @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the speed of light .",
    "this is most easily understood from the vantage point of a moving frame of reference.@xcite in the former case , there always exists a moving frame where the electric field vanishes , and the particle experiences a pure magnetic field .",
    "conversely , in the latter case , there always exists a frame where the magnetic field vanishes , and the particle experiences a pure electric field .",
    "boosting back to the lab frame , we mix in the complementary field component , but the qualitative character of the motion is more `` electric field like '' or `` magnetic field like '' , as dictated by the inequalities  see fig .  [",
    "fig : regimes ] .",
    "we shall discuss this in more detail below , but before doing so , we note that our problem is a little more subtle due to the appearance of an _ effective speed of light _ , @xmath109 , in the effective field theory ( [ slg ] ) , and the associated qbe ( [ qbe ] ) .",
    "what matters for our purposes , at least in the first instance , is the solutions to the qbe ( [ qbe ] ) for a given fixed ratio of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it may be seen that these solutions are kinematically distinct for , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , as follows directly from the left hand side of the differential equation , without recourse to lorentz invariance arguments . as ,",
    "such it the _ effective _ lorentz structure which plays a key rle in determining the solutions of the relativistic qbe ( [ qbe ] ) , and we shall henceforth use this effective speed of light in our subsequent discussions .",
    "it is interesting to note that such lorentz transformation arguments also find applications in other effective relativistic systems , as was recently discussed by lukose _",
    "et al _ in the context of graphene.@xcite    under a lorentz transformation with a velocity @xmath112 , the electric and magnetic fields transform according to @xcite @xmath113 where , @xmath114 , and we work in si units .",
    "it is readily seen that for crossed @xmath104 and @xmath105 fields , with @xmath115 , there exists a frame moving at the drift velocity @xmath116 where the electric field @xmath117 vanishes . in this moving frame ,",
    "the particle is subject to a pure magnetic field of reduced strength , @xmath118 .",
    "taking our magnetic field to point along the z - axis , the particle executes cyclotron orbits in the moving frame with , @xmath119 and @xmath120 ; here @xmath121 is the radius of the orbit , @xmath122 is the cyclotron frequency , and the signs indicate the sense of rotation for positive and negative charges respectively . with the electric field along the @xmath123-axis ,",

    "this combination of different perspectives is particularly useful in establishing the onsager relations between the transport coefficients.@xcite it also helps demonstrate the equivalence between the field theory and quantum boltzmann approaches .",

    "sect : be ] we turn our attention to the more general problem of the lorentz invariant solutions of the qbe . in section [",
    "sect : thc ] we use this explicit distribution to determine the heat current response to an electric field , and verify the answer obtained by entropy drift . in section [ sect : lr ] we demonstrate how this result also follows from a more familiar linearization of the qbe",
    ". such a linearization approach will be particularly useful in the presence of thermal gradients , where lorentz field transformation arguments are not available .",
    "in section [ sect : num ] we finally turn to the epsilon expansion itself , and evaluate our general expression for @xmath69 numerically .",

    "provided the onsager relations are satisfied , this may also be obtained ( up to a factor of temperature ) from the heat current which flows in response to a temperature gradient .",
