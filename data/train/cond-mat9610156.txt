    "over many decades one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin systems ( ` quantum spin chains ' ) have attracted a lot of interest and led to the development of many theoretical methods which are now commonly used for the study of other highly correlated systems.@xcite despite the apparent simplicity of quantum spin chains , they show a wealth of physical properties which give a key to our understanding of various phenomena , e.g. , quantum phase transitions , topological order , and fractional statistics.@xcite since the discovery of various quasi-1d materials , the study of 1d spin systems , which is mainly based on the heisenberg model and its variations , is also of experimental relevance .",
    "examples of such materials include so - called nino , nenp,@xcite and @xmath6.@xcite in particular , the latter system belongs to a class of compounds which is compositionally very flexible and has been under intense experimental investigation over the last few years .",
    "this type of quasi-1d system was first reported in @xmath7 by randall and katz,@xcite and it is now possible to produce compounds of the form @xmath8 in various combinations with m = cu , mg , zn , yb , na , ca , co and n = pt , ir , rh , bi .",
    "disorder effects play a particularly important role in 1d quantum spin systems , as even small deviations from the regular system often destabilize the pure phases.@xcite real experimental systems naturally contain impurities and other types of disorder .",
    "therefore it is very important to understand the influence of disorder on the properties of such systems in order to interpret experimental results . to our knowledge ,",
    "the first 1d spin system recognized for its disorder belongs to the class of charge - transfer salts tcnq ( tetracyanoquinodimethanide).@xcite these systems have been successfully described by a 1d spin-@xmath9 heisenberg model with random strength of antiferromagnetic exchange couplings between the spins .",
    "a more recent example of disordered spin chains is @xmath10.@xcite while the pure compounds @xmath6 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin systems , respectively , the alloy @xmath10 contains both af and fm couplings .",
    "the fraction of fm bonds is simply related to @xmath14 , the concentration of ir ions . in a previous work , we modeled @xmath10 with a nearest - neighbor spin-@xmath9 heisenberg chain , where the exchange coupling between neighboring spins is @xmath15 or @xmath16 with probability @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the methods we used ( high - temperature expansion and transfer matrix approximation ) give reliable results down to @xmath19 , where @xmath1 is the temperature and @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant . in this regime the numerically calculated magnetic susceptibility @xmath21 and the specific heat @xmath22 interpolate smoothly between the corresponding quantities of purely fm ( @xmath23 ) and af ( @xmath24 ) chains , giving good qualitative agreement with experimental data.@xcite at temperatures below @xmath25 the effects of disorder become significant .",
    "we demonstrated that in this temperature regime spins correlate within af and fm segments of the chain separately .",
    "the emerging new degrees of freedom which dominate the thermodynamics are ( large ) effective spins each corresponding to a correlated segment .",
    "the size of these spins and their residual interaction are set by the local disorder and hence is random . from exact diagonalization of finite segments we concluded that the low - temperature physics of the random spin system is described by the effective hamiltonian , @xmath26 where both the couplings @xmath27 , which may have either sign , and the spin sizes @xmath28 are random . in particular , we emphasize that the resulting distribution of @xmath27 in eq .",

    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) as starting point .",
    "we discuss the low - temperature properties of this model , and the various fixed points encountered for different initial distributions of couplings and spins.@xcite    before going into details we briefly summarize our results and the method we use , which is a generalization of the rsrg scheme introduced by ma , dasgupta and hu ( mdh ) in 1979 to study the 1d spin-@xmath9 random antiferromagnet ( raf).@xcite the raf , where all couplings are antiferromagnetic but vary in magnitude , has also been investigated using kadanoff block spin rg techniques,@xcite and more recently by the density matrix rg method.@xcite the method of dasgupta _ et al .",

    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) contains arbitrary spin sizes and couplings with random sign , so that , in general , two correlated spins do not combine into a singlet .",
    "rather they form an effective spin with renormalized couplings to its neighbors . here",
    "we introduce a modified rsrg scheme which takes this into account . like the mdh rsrg scheme it conserves the form of the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) , but changes the distributions of couplings and gaps .",
    "the rg flow generated can therefore be thought of as a flow in the space of distributions of couplings and gaps.@xcite we demonstrate that for a wide range of initial distributions of couplings and spins , the rg flow of the distribution functions eventually approaches a single universal fixed point .",
    "this fixed point represents the following physical properties .",
    "both entropy and specific heat vanish as @xmath29 , where the power @xmath30 is rather small .",
    "the exponent @xmath31 appears also in the non - linear magnetization where @xmath32 for sufficiently large fields @xmath33 . for very singular initial distribution of the couplings we find that @xmath31 takes a non - universal value , suggesting the presence of a fixed line .",
    "we also find a surprising fact that , for both the universal and non - universal fixed points , the susceptibility follows the curie behavior down to zero temperature with a non - universal curie constant .",

    "let @xmath121 be the fraction of af links in the chain .",
    "both fm ( @xmath11 ) and af ( @xmath13 ) chains are unstable towards a small concentration of couplings of the opposite sign . to see that @xmath13 is unstable , we note that unless the effective spin formed is a singlet , the removal of a link in an af chain converts one neighboring link into a fm link . similarly @xmath11 is unstable because an isolated af link in a fm environment always survives ( the removal of a fm link does not change the signs of its neighboring links , and if the af link itself is removed , one of its fm neighbors is converted into an af link ) .",
    "this implies that for small enough @xmath14 the absolute number of af links is constant , so that the fraction @xmath14 of af links increases as links are removed . thus ,",
    "unless we start with a completely fm random spin chain or a purely af random spin chain with uniform magnitude of the spins , the fixed - point distribution contains both fm and af links .",
    "having established that both @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the fraction of af and fm links at the fixed point respectively , are non - zero , we can easily derive the relations ( [ eq : exre1]-c ) .",
    "since a finite fraction of the spins belong to both a fm and an af link , there can not be a separation in scales between spin sizes in af and fm links , i.e. , @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) follows from the fact that the average gap in the fm ( af ) distribution , when measured in units of @xmath98 is finite and independent of @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath127 follows trivially from the finiteness of @xmath122 @xmath128 which must be independent of @xmath98 .",
    "an analogous argument for @xmath123 implies @xmath129 .",
    "the last relation ( 16d ) requires a more detailed analysis of the way effective spins are formed by correlating the original spins in clusters .",
    "the size of the effective spin corresponds to the spin quantum number of the ground state of the cluster .",
    "since the spin system is not frustrated the spin quantum number is determined from the classical correlation of the spins ( parallel and antiparallel ) .",
    "the total spin of a cluster of @xmath112 spins is then given by @xmath130 where two neighboring spins enter the sum with the same ( opposite ) sign if their mutual coupling is ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "this leads to a typical random walk problem which results in the scaling @xmath131 from this we conclude @xmath132 .",
    "the remaining independent exponent , which we take to be @xmath31 , is related to the average renormalization of the gaps .",
    "consider two neighboring effective spins with a coupling corresponding to a gap @xmath133 .",
    "suppose also that each of the two effective spins is made up of @xmath134 spins at some larger energy scale @xmath135 .",
    "as the energy scale is lowered from @xmath135 to @xmath133 and the @xmath134 spins form one large effective spin , the gap @xmath133 is typically renormalized @xmath136 times ( @xmath137 times in the course of formation of the left effective spin and similarly @xmath137 times from the right ) .",
    "if the magnitude of a gap is reduced on average by a factor @xmath138 each time a neighboring link is replaced with an effective spin , then @xmath139 from which we read off the relation @xmath140    using the scaling form , we can get some information on long - distance behavior of spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "let us introduce two kinds of spin - spin correlation functions which characterizes the correlation between spins at low temperatures .",
    "the first one is the usual spin - spin correlation function , @xmath141 where @xmath142 represents both thermal average and average over random configurations .",
    "since the number of af bonds between @xmath42 and @xmath143 is random , the two spins may either be in parallel or antiparallel .",

    "therefore this correlation function does not reflect the correlations leading to the formation of effective large spins .",
    "an appropriate correlation function is @xmath146 where @xmath147 for @xmath148 . at finite temperature",
    "this correlation function should also decay exponentially for large @xmath144 with the correlation length @xmath112 : @xmath149 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scal2 ] ) we find that the correlation length grows with decreasing temperature as @xmath150 .",
    "it is likely that at zero temperature the correlation function decays algebraically as @xmath151 unfortunately we can not determine the value of this new exponent @xmath152 from our numerical rg scheme .",

    "we start each simulation by generating a chain according to independent probability distributions for gaps and spins . in each decimation step",
    "we pick up the strongest link in the chain , replace it with an appropriate effective spin , and renormalize the neighboring bonds . to keep the number of links fixed , one site is finally added in one end of the chain .",
    "this procedure is then iterated until the shape of the distribution function of links no longer changes . in this way we have iterated",

    "our numerical simulations demonstrate that unless the initial distribution has a high degree of singularity for small gaps , the distribution of links in the chain eventually flows to a universal fixed - point distribution of af and fm links .",
    "if the initial distribution of gaps is more singular than @xmath153 , @xmath154 , our numerical simulations suggest that the corresponding fixed - point distribution is non - universal .",
    "this is analogous to the raf where it has been shown that extremely singular components in the gap distribution are conserved in the rg flow.@xcite in the case of the raf @xmath155 , so that the condition for a chain to flow to the universal fixed - point distribution coincides with normalizability .",

    "thus , even from a regular link - distribution the rg transformation itself produces a singular fixed - point distribution of gaps , where the degree of the singularity , @xmath179 , is set by details in the rg transformation rather than by the initial conditions .",

    "the fact that a very singular fixed - point distribution is dominated by the weakest links in the initial chain casts some doubt on the numerical results for such chains at low energies .",
