    "hot jupiters could not have formed at their current locations because of the high gas temperature and low disk mass at these small radii @xcite .",
    "instead , they must have formed beyond a few au and then have migrated inwards , probably by angular momentum exchange with the protoplanetary disk @xcite or by high - eccentricity migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which the migrating planet attains very high eccentricities and tidal dissipation circularizes the orbit . within the latter migration scenario ,",
    "several different mechanisms to excite the eccentricity to high values have been proposed : the kozai - lidov mechanism in stellar binaries @xcite , planet - planet scattering @xcite , and secular interactions between planets @xcite .",
    "although all of the migration mechanisms above can form hot jupiters , which is the dominant channel ( if any ) remains an open question .    in this paper , we study the possibility that hot jupiters are formed by the secular interaction of two planets in initially eccentric orbits in a hierarchical configuration ( @xmath18a_{\\rm out}$ ] ) with relatively low mutual inclinations ( @xmath0 ) .",

    "the eccentricity distribution of these systems can reproduce the wide eccentricity distribution ( median of @xmath19 ) observed in the rv sample @xcite .",
    "planet - planet scattering does not only excite the planetary eccentricities , but it does also excite the planetary inclinations .",
    "however , in a significant fraction of the reported scattering experiments the planets end up in orbits with @xmath20 and mutual inclinations @xmath0",
    "( @xmath21 radians ) , for which chem can operate @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite show that the mutual inclination of two surviving planets after planet - planet scattering in an initial three - planet system follows an exponential distribution with mean @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "various systems of two hierarchical planets on eccentric orbits are known to date .",
    "@xcite show that four known rv planets in multi - planet systems exhibit large amplitude secular eccentricity oscillations ( inner planet reaches a maximum eccentricity @xmath24 ) and a stability analysis suggests that their ( unknown ) mutual inclinations are not too high so the inner planet avoids plunging into star .",

    "the secular interaction between two planets in a hierarchical and coplanar configuration has been previously studied by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that that the planetary orbits can engage in libration of @xmath30 around either @xmath31 or @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the longitudes of pericenter of the inner and outer bodies .",
    "this libration can cause large amplitude eccentricity oscillations of either planet and , most important for this work , in some cases the inner planet might reach eccentricities large enough for friction due to tides raised on the planet by the host star to become important .",
    "similar to the previous work by @xcite and @xcite , @xcite recently studied the secular evolution of two hierarchical , nearly coplanar , and eccentric bodies , but in the test particle limit ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "these authors confirmed that in this limit , the inner planet can reach unit eccentricity , derived a simple analytical condition for this to happen ( see eq . [ [ eq : li14 ] ] ) , and showed that the orbit can flip its angular momentum vector to produce a coplanar retrograde planet .    here , we extend these works by studying the conditions on the masses and the orbital elements in hierarchical and nearly coplanar planetary systems required to drive the eccentricities close to unity , and also by including the effects from general relativistic precession and tides that can limit the eccentricity growth .",
    "in this section we use a time - averaged hamiltonian of two hierarchical and nearly coplanar orbits expanded in series of the semi - major axis ratio to describe their secular evolution and assess which orbital elements and planetary masses allow for @xmath36 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite the coplanar problem has one degree of freedom : three variables ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath30 ) and two conserved quantities ( energy and total orbital angular momentum , equations [ [ eq : potential ] ] and [ [ eq : am ] ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we shall use the notation from @xcite in which the variables are the eccentricity vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the orbital angular momentum vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 all defined in the jacobi s reference frame .",

    "similarly , there is only one physical solution when @xmath72 , which is given by @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "this result implies that in the test particle approximation there can be only libration of @xmath70 and @xmath37 around one fixed point at @xmath72 .    in summary ,",
    "the secular phase - space trajectories of two hierarchical and coplanar orbits include circulation of @xmath70 and also libration of @xmath70 around @xmath100 and @xmath32 .",

    "thus , from equation ( [ eq : cond_full_3 ] ) and only varying @xmath177 ( @xmath107 ) and @xmath37 , we get that the maximum eccentricity in the final state depends on the semi - major axis ( mass ratio @xmath107 ) as @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) a similar reasoning yields a scaling @xmath207 ( and @xmath208 ) if the dominant extra force is the tidal quadrupole .    despite the larger eccentricities observed with @xmath199 au compared to @xmath186 au , the minimum pericenter distances in dynamically stable configurations are similar . for these configurations ( left of the black dashed line )",

    "thus , the most likely initial semi - major axis ratios are probably close to @xmath377 .    roughly speaking , from the arguments above we conclude that if the inner planet commenced chem at @xmath378 au , the most likely properties of outer planet are @xmath379 au and @xmath380 ( from eq . [ [ eq : in_out ] ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "the outer planets in hj systems formed by chem have moderate eccentricities ( @xmath381 ) and low mutual inclinations relative to the hj s orbit .",
    "their eccentricities are expected to be larger for outer perturbers at wider separations or with higher masses .",
    "based on the minimum initial eccentricities required for chem to operate we determine the most likely semi - major axis and mass ratios to be @xmath377 and @xmath380 , respectively .",
    "we have shown that chem produces hot jupiters in prograde and low obliquity orbits ( assuming an initially zero misalignment of the planetary orbit relative to host star spin ) .",
    "on the contrary , @xcite concluded that chem is a mechanism to produce counter - orbiting hot jupiters ( obliquities of @xmath382 ) .",
    "we understand this difference from the necessary condition to flip the orbit from prograde to retrograde , which is that eccentricity forcing mechanism studied here can produce extremely high eccentricities : @xmath383 @xcite . in order for this to happen",
    "the migrating planet has to be initially placed at large enough semi - major axis to satisfy the following requirements :    * the planet does not get tidally disrupted by reaching pericenter that are too close to the host star .",
    "for instance , according to @xcite a jupiter - like planet orbiting a sun - like star gets disrupted if @xmath384 au , which implies that that the planet should start at @xmath385 au to avoid disruption when @xmath386 . * extra precession forces ( e.g. , gr precession )",
    "do not efficiently limit the eccentricity growth . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : max_e_extra ] , the maximum eccentricity depends on @xmath177 as @xmath205 ( @xmath207 ) if the dominant precession source is gr ( the tidal quadrupole ) .",
    "thus , all other things being equal , the maximum eccentricity can reach higher values for larger semi - major axes .    in this work ,",
    "we have considered an initial semi - major axes in @xmath387 au and the effects from gr precession , tides , and tidal disruptions .",
    "therefore , the maximum eccentricity is not high to allow for orbit flipping ( see maximum eccentricities in figure [ fig : emax_phi ] ) , although it does allow for moderate excitation ( up to @xmath248 ) of the mutual inclination between the orbits ( see panel c in figure [ fig : example_sec ] )",
    ".    in the systematic study of coplanar flips by @xcite , the authors ignore the effects from tides and tidal disruptions , and consider the test particle limit @xmath131 for which the extra precession forces like gr become much less efficient than the planetary regime considered here ( @xmath388 ) at limiting the maximum eccentricity growth .",
    "recall from the arguments in  [ sec : max_e_extra ] that @xmath206 if gr is the dominant precession force .",
    "all these approximations allow for the inner eccentricity to reach extremely high values and flip . the authors do consider the effect of tides and tidal disruptions in one example of an orbit flip ( figure 7 therein ) , but in this example the inner planet is initially placed at large enough distances ( @xmath389 au ) that it can avoid both being tidally disrupted and having the eccentricity growth efficiently limited by extra precession forces . in summary ,",
    "chem generally produces hot jupiters with low obliquities .",
    "it might , however , produce highly mis - aligned hot jupiters provided that the migrating planet starts migration from a large ( @xmath390 au ) semi - major axis .",
    "various high - eccentricity migration mechanisms have been shown to produce hot jupiters from gravitational interactions between planets like in chem .",
    "we briefly comment on the main differences between these mechanisms and chem .",
    "first , hot jupiters can be formed by the chaotic secular interactions between two or more planets in eccentric and/or mutually inclined orbits , proposed and termed secular chaos by @xcite . here , the eccentricity excitation is chaotic and depends on the mutual inclination between planets since coplanar systems become much more regular . on the contrary ,",
    "the eccentricity excitation from chem is regular ( non - chaotic ) and does not depend on the initial mutual inclination provided that it is not too high ( @xmath391 ) .",
    "both chem and secular chaos predict that hot jupiters should have distant planetary companions .",
    "chem requires of only one companion , while secular chaos does favor having two or more planetary companions because the system has more degrees of freedom .",
    "second , hot jupiters might be formed by the kozai - lidov ( kl ) mechanism @xcite . unlike chem",
    ", the kl mechanism would require that the planetary orbits have initially high ( @xmath392 ) mutual inclinations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also the eccentricity excitation in chem happens in the octupole timescale that is longer by a factor of @xmath393 than the quadrupole timescale that governs the kl mechanism .",
    "this slower eccentricity excitation allows for extra precession forces such as gr and tides to limit the maximum eccentricity growth more efficiently , leading to the formation of hot jupiters with semi - major axes generally larger than those expected from kl migration .",
    "all the mechanisms above , including chem , require an initial configuration with well - spaced and eccentric or / and mutually inclined orbits either of additional planets or stellar companions .",
    "given that we do not know the initial states of planetary systems , it is difficult to assess which mechanism is more likely to be prevalent .",
    "one natural candidate to explain the initial conditions required for these different high - eccentricity migration scenarios is planet - planet scattering starting from initially unstable planetary systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we plan to address which set of initial conditions are more likely to emerge from scattering in a future work ( petrovich & tremaine 2015 , in prep . )",
    "we have shown that chem can produce hot jupiters .",
    "whether chem produces most hot jupiters is a more difficult issue to address since we do not know the initial states of planetary systems .",
    "however , we can partly address this issue by comparing the predictions from chem with the available ( or upcoming ) observations .",
    "coplanar high - eccentricity migration predicts :    1 .   _ a pile - up of hot jupiters at @xmath394 au . _ + this pile - up is a natural consequence from chem since it excites the eccentricity of the migrating planet very slowly ( slower than the kozai - lidov mechanism by a factor @xmath393 ) allowing for pericenter precession forces due to general relativity and tides to efficiently limit the maximum eccentricity growth ( see figure [ fig : emax_phi ] ) .",
    "this limit in the eccentricity translates into a minimum pericenter distance and the formation of a hot jupiter with semi - major axis roughly twice this minimum distance , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : hj_sma ] . +",
    "this predicted concentration of hot jupiters with @xmath394 au compares well with the observations of hot jupiters detected in transit and rv surveys ( see figure [ fig : hj_sma ] ) .",
    "2 .   _ hot jupiters with low stellar obliquities . _ + the low stellar obliquities of hj systems are a natural consequence of chem since",
    "the eccentricity of the migrating planet can be excited to high values without exciting its inclination .",
    "this result shows that , like disk - driven migration , high - eccentricity migration can also preserve the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbits . +",
    "our population synthesis study shows that chem mostly produces hjs with projected obliquities @xmath5 , and almost @xmath395 of the current observations fall into this range .",
    "the remaining population of mis - aligned hot jupiters might be explained by either another high - eccentricity migration channel or a mechanism that tilts the star or the plane of the planetary system .",
    "_ a few percent occurrence rate of hot jupiters per distant giant planet_. +",
    "our population synthesis study shows that @xmath396 of the systems produce a hot jupiter .",
    "this number mostly depends on the initial eccentricities since most hjs are formed starting from @xmath397 and @xmath398 , a range containing @xmath399 and @xmath400 of the known planets with @xmath231 au , respectively .",
    "this fraction can increase by : * shifting the stability boundary for hierarchical triple systems ( eq . [ [ eq : stability ] ] ) towards higher eccentricities . indeed , we repeated the population synthesis study using the less restrictive stability condition @xmath401 from @xcite and observed that the occurrence rate increased from @xmath402 in our study using equation ( [ eq : stability ] ) to @xmath403 ; * starting with positively correlated inner and outer eccentricities , which might be expected from an initial scattering phase .",
    "+ if chem dominates the formation of hjs then the ratio between the number of hjs and the number of gas giant planets should be @xmath404 .",
    "this ratio is roughly consistent with the one derived from observations of @xmath405 since the occurrence rate of hjs is @xmath406 @xcite and that of the gas giant planet at au distances is @xmath399 @xcite .",
    "_ hot jupiters have distant massive companions in nearly coplanar and moderately eccentric orbits_. + the most likely outer planets in hj systems formed by chem have moderate eccentricities ( @xmath381 ) , low inclinations ( @xmath407 ) relative to the hj s orbit , and masses @xmath7 times larger than that of the hj ( see  [ sec : outer ] ) .",
    "also , the most likely semi - major axis ratio before commencing migration is @xmath377 so assuming that chem started at @xmath231 au , we expect companions at @xmath6 au . + since",
    "the rv surveys have characterized giant planets with full orbits up to @xmath408 au , we expect that most of the companions predicted by chem generally appear as rv linear trends .",
    "recently , @xcite estimated that @xmath409 of the hjs have a companion with @xmath410 au and masses of @xmath411 , while the masses of the planetary companion tend to be comparable to or larger than the transiting hjs .",

    "+ we observe that the eccentricities and mass ratios ( assuming nearly coplanar orbits ) from hd 217107 and hd 187123 are roughly consistent with the most likely range predicted from chem of @xmath9 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this result suggests that chem might have operated to form these close - in planets .",
    "migration in these systems should have commenced within @xmath424 au since the companions are at @xmath425 au . + on the contrary , hat - p-13 has a mass ratio @xmath426 and the perturber is at @xmath424 au , making chem an unlikely formation scenario .",
    "moreover , given the high eccentricity of the outer planet the stability boundary of hierarchical triple systems in equation ( [ eq : stability ] ) constrains the inner planet to @xmath427 au and , therefore , inconsistent with any high - eccentricity migration scenario .",
    "_ hj formation timescales that increase exponentially with semi - major axis . _",
    "+ from our population synthesis study we find that the minimum timescale to form a hot jupiter depends exponentially with semi - major and found an empirical fit given by equation ( [ eq : tmig ] ) . as discussed in  [ sec : timescale ] , this minimum formation timescale for the two hot jupiters in the beehive cluster is consistent with its age 600 myr @xcite . future age constraints from hot jupiter systems might prove useful to constrain chem .",
    "+ more generally speaking , this minimum formation timescale from chem implies that the occurrence rate of hot jupiters should increase with stellar age and that the hot jupiters with larger semi - major axes should be restricted to older systems .",

    "this observation is particularly interesting because these planets are hardly produced by other migration mechanism .",
    "other high - eccentricity migration mechanisms can produce high - eccentricity close - in planets similar to chem , but these planets generally have higher obliquities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , disk - migration can naturally produce low - obliquity close - in planets , but neither disk - migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) nor planet - planet scattering after migration to small orbital separations are expected to excite high eccentricities @xcite .",
