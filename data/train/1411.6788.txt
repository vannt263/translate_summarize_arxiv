    "this paper is devoted to the analysis of an algebraic curve .",
    "this curve plays an important role in the analytic theory of hermite - pad approximants .",
    "we start with their definition .",
    "let @xmath3 be a vector of @xmath4 laurent series near infinity @xmath5 the _ hermite - pad rational approximants _ ( of type ii ) @xmath6 for the vector @xmath7 and multi - index @xmath8 are defined by @xmath9 @xmath10 where the @xmath11 are polynomials , for @xmath12 .",
    "this definition is equivalent to a homogeneous linear system of equations for the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath13 .",
    "this system always has a solution , but the solution is not necessarily unique . in the case of uniqueness ( up to a multiplicative constant ) and in case",
    "every non - trivial solution has full degree @xmath14 , the multi - index @xmath14 is called _ normal _ and the polynomial @xmath13 can be normalized to be monic @xmath15 the hermite - pad approximants @xmath16 provide the best local ( at infinity ) simultaneous rational approximation of the vector @xmath17 of the laurent series ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) with a common denominator .",
    "the construction ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) was introduced by hermite @xcite in connection with his proof of the transcendence of @xmath18 .",
    "see the papers @xcite for more details .    a key problem in the study of the analytical properties ( convergence , asymptotics ) of the _ diagonal _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath19 ) hermite - pad approximants is to determine the limiting distribution of the zeros of the common denominator @xmath13 , which are the poles of the hermite - pad approximants , i.e. , to determine the weak-@xmath20 limit of the discrete measures @xmath21    a class of analytic functions @xmath22 with a finite number of branch points plays an important role in recent investigations .",
    "we denote the sets of the branch points of the functions @xmath23 by @xmath24 .",
    "we say that @xmath25 if the laurent expansion ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) is convergent in a neighborhood of infinity and has an analytic continuation along any path in the complex plane @xmath26 avoiding the sets @xmath27 of the branch points .    in accordance with nuttall s conjecture",
    "( see @xcite ) the limit of the zero counting measures exists @xmath28 and the cauchy transform of @xmath29 ( after analytic continuation ) is an algebraic function of order @xmath30 .",
    "we denote this function by @xmath31 and we denote the algebraic riemann surface of @xmath31 by @xmath32 .",
    "the function @xmath31 has branches @xmath33 which at infinity behave as @xmath34 in particular , the conjecture states that the branch @xmath35 ( fixed at infinity ) is the cauchy transform of the limiting zero counting measure @xmath36 moreover , the conjecture describes the strong asymptotics of the hermite - pad approximants using riemann - hilbert boundary problems on the riemann surface @xmath32 .",
    "however , a still unsolved problem is how to find ( for a general setting ) the main ingredient of the nuttall conjecture , i.e. , the riemann surface @xmath32 .    in @xcite a potential theory approach to define a corresponding riemann surface @xmath32 for the case of two functions with a finite number of branch points",
    "was suggested .",
    "the potential theory approach was proposed for the first time in @xcite for real analytic functions with real sets of branch points @xmath27 and nonintersecting intervals @xmath37 , which are the convex hulls of  @xmath27 @xmath38 an approach based on the notion of nuttall s condenser was proposed recently by rakhmanov and suetin in @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of the diagonal hermite - pad approximants for two functions @xmath39 was started in @xcite .",
    "a typical example consists of the functions @xmath40 .",
    "only the case where the dispositions of the branch points of @xmath41 and @xmath42 lead to a corresponding riemann surface @xmath32 of genus zero was studied in @xcite .",
    "a complete characterization of algebraic curves of the third order , and of genus zero , which have the fixed projections @xmath43 of the branch points , was carried out in @xcite , @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper , as in @xcite , we consider the case of two pairs of branch points and , in order to describe the asymptotics of the hermite - pad approximants , we investigate a numerical procedure for finding the equation of the algebraic riemann surface @xmath32 of genus higher than zero .    throughout the paper we use the following notation , conventions and definitions .",
    "we denote the branches of a multi - valued function @xmath31 by @xmath33 and the variable @xmath44 always belongs to subsets of the extended complex plane @xmath45 .",
    "an algebraic function @xmath31 satisfies an irreducible algebraic equation of order @xmath30 with polynomial ( in @xmath44 ) coefficients . for each @xmath45 which is not a branch point of @xmath31 ,",
    "the solutions of this equation define different branches of @xmath31 .",
    "the riemann surface @xmath32 of the algebraic function @xmath31 is the ( @xmath30)-sheeted covering of the extended complex plane with a finite number of branch points on which @xmath31 becomes a single - valued function @xmath46 . here",
    "the variable @xmath47 always belongs to @xmath32 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the natural projection @xmath32 on @xmath49 ( surjection ) and @xmath50 . a defragmentation of @xmath32 ( by cuts joining the branch points ) into a collection @xmath51 of open , disjunctive sets such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 is called a sheet structure .",
    "for @xmath32 with assigned sheet structure @xmath51 we denote by @xmath54 the points @xmath55 , @xmath56 and for a single - valued function @xmath57 on @xmath32 we can select the global branches by setting @xmath58 .    from now on ,",
    "we only consider the ( already quite difficult ) case @xmath59 .",
    "now we give a formal definition of the function @xmath31 which will be the main subject for our analysis in this paper . given four points @xmath60 , denote by @xmath61 the monic polynomial with roots at these points @xmath62 we are looking for an algebraic function @xmath31 of the third order , which satisfies several requirements :    1 .",
    "it has poles only at the branch points of @xmath32 ( i.e. , the algebraic riemann surface where @xmath31 is single - valued ) whose projections belong to the given set  @xmath63 @xmath64 moreover , the order of a possible pole is less than the winding number of the branch point .",
    "2 .   the branches of @xmath31 at infinity behave as @xmath65    other requirements for @xmath31 will be given latter .",
    "the first two conditions imply that this function has to satisfy the equation @xmath66 where the monic polynomials @xmath67 and @xmath68 are such that @xmath69 , @xmath70 . indeed , if we consider the rational function @xmath71 on @xmath49 , then a possible pole at the point @xmath72 has order @xmath73 for @xmath74 , and therefore the rational function @xmath75 is bounded in @xmath49 , which implies that @xmath75 is constant in @xmath49 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath31 at infinity shows that the constant is @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis at infinity of the other symmetric functions of @xmath76 gives the form of the remaining coefficients of the equation .",
    "to find out more of the polynomials @xmath67 and @xmath68 we note that the remainder terms in have the same order as in , i.e. , @xmath77 indeed , since the branch @xmath35 has no branching at the point at infinity , the absence of branching of @xmath78 , @xmath70 leads to .",
    "on the other hand , if the point @xmath79 is a branch point for @xmath78 , @xmath70 , then the absence of a pole ( in the local variable ) at this branch point again implies , i.e. , having a branch point there we can exclude from the above expansions fractional degrees of @xmath44 between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore implies the following estimate of the discriminant @xmath80 of the algebraic equation of @xmath31 in the neighborhood of the point at infinity @xmath81 the discriminant of the equation ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) is @xmath82 and we see that the assumptions on @xmath31 lead to @xmath83 which gives a linear equation for the coefficients of @xmath67 and @xmath68 and we obtain the representation @xmath84 with two unknown parameters @xmath85 .",
    "we have to impose extra conditions on @xmath31 to find these unknown parameters @xmath85 .",
    "to get an extra condition on @xmath31 we recall the formal definition of the abelian integral which plays the key role for the general conjectures of nuttall ( see @xcite ) on the asymptotics of hermite - pad approximants . for an algebraic three - sheeted @xmath32",
    "the _ abelian integral of nuttall _",
    "@xmath86 is defined by the following two conditions .    1 .",
    "the abelian integral @xmath86 is regular on the whole @xmath32 , except at @xmath87 , where it has logarithmic singularities @xmath88 2 .",
    "@xmath86 has purely imaginary periods on @xmath32 .",
    "it is known @xcite that for any algebraic riemann surface @xmath32 the abelian integral of nuttall @xmath86 exists and the above conditions define it uniquely up to an additive constant @xmath89 .",
    "we can write @xmath90 where a single - valued and meromorphic function @xmath75 on @xmath32 is the derivative of @xmath86 . since the integral is defined up to a constant @xmath89 , the choice of the starting point for the integration path does not play a role and we can put it at an arbitrary point . we choose to put it at @xmath91 .",
    "the second condition from above means that the function @xmath92 is single - valued on @xmath32 up to the additive constant @xmath93 from . to fix this",
    "constant we set @xmath94 thus , the second condition is equivalent to the existence of the single - valued function @xmath57 on @xmath32 @xmath95    we see that , due to and , the abelian integral @xmath86 of nuttall on the riemann surface @xmath32 of the function @xmath31 is represented by @xmath96 if and only if the condition is fulfilled , i.e. , along any closed contour @xmath97 on @xmath32 we have @xmath98 thus , we shall use the condition , i.e. , the vanishing of the real parts of the periods of the integral , as an extra condition on @xmath31 in order to find the unknown parameters @xmath85 .",
    "now we show that in our case @xmath99 and @xmath27 , @xmath70 as in the conditions , and define no more than a finite number of functions @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "indeed , ( see , ) we have three possibilities : @xmath101    * , the condition  ( [ eq:1.9 ] ) is always fulfilled , however  ( [ eq:1.12])-0 gives two algebraic conditions ( double zeros @xmath102 ) for the determination of the two parameters @xmath85 . in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite the problem @xmath103 for this case was solved and it was shown that for the case @xmath104 @xmath105 * , we have in  ( [ eq:1.12])-1 one algebraic ( complex ) condition ( a double zero @xmath106 ) and , since @xmath32 for this case has two cycles , ( [ eq:1.9 ] ) provides two real conditions .",
    "thus we have one complex and two real conditions for the determination of the two complex parameters @xmath85 . * , condition  ( [ eq:1.9 ] ) gives 4 real valued relations for the two complex parameters @xmath85 .    to make a choice of the unique @xmath31 from the finite set of functions satisfying the conditions , and we have to analyze the geometrical structure of the set @xmath107 : @xmath108 thus our main goal is to start from the input data ( [ eq:1.6 ] ) to get all admissible parameters @xmath85 and to analyze for them the geometrical structure of the set @xmath109 . as we already mentioned for the case of @xmath104 , this problem",
    "was completely solved in @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the cases @xmath110 .",
    "we start in section  [ sec:2 ] with some simple explicit examples of functions @xmath31 , as in  , of genus 1 and some examples of functions @xmath31 of genus 2 obtained by a numerical procedure .",
    "we have to note that the class of functions @xmath31 , as in , , , of genus 2 is a generic class , in the sense that if ( in the process of computation ) we slightly perturb our data , then we still remain in the case of genus 2 .",
    "in contrast , the case of genus 1 is a degenerated case ( we have a double zero @xmath106 which bifurcates under perturbations and moves @xmath31 from the case of genus 1 to the generic case of genus 2 ) .",
    "this induces complications for the numerical procedure of finding an appropriate @xmath31 of genus 1 .",
    "the main goal of our paper is to find a parametrization of @xmath111 in , such that the algebraic function @xmath31 has genus 1 .",
    "this allows us to run a numeric procedure which remains in the non - generic class of genus 1 .    in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we find the explicit form of a conformal map of the three - sheeted riemann surface @xmath32 of the algebraic function @xmath31 , as in , , , on a two - sheeted riemann surface @xmath112 .",
    "it gives a hyperelliptic ( elliptic or ultra - elliptic , depending on the genus ) uniformization of the algebraic curve . in the notation of , ,",
    "we have    [ t1 ] a conformal equivalence of the riemann surfaces @xmath113 and @xmath114 is established by the formulas @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the derivative of the polynomial with respect to its variable and @xmath117 is the polynomial @xmath118 and the inversion of is @xmath119 in the new variables @xmath120 the equation of the algebraic curve becomes @xmath121    from this theorem we get an expression for the abelian integral of nuttall in the variables @xmath122 .",
    "[ cot1 ] @xmath123    in section  [ sec:3 ] we also consider an example of a conformal mapping of @xmath113 of genus 1 with branch points @xmath124 on the two sheeted riemann surface @xmath114",
    ".    section  [ sec:4 ] is devoted to the parametrization of the algebraic curve @xmath31 of genus 1 . as a parameter",

    "finally , in section  [ sec:4 ] we consider an example of the application of the parametrization . for @xmath31 in  we find the unknown coefficients @xmath85 by a numeric procedure , such that @xmath131 and condition is fulfilled .",
    "we start with some simple examples of the algebraic function @xmath31 of genus 1 for which the coefficients of the equation can be found explicitly .",
    "it is the case when the input data , i.e. , the branch points @xmath134 , have central symmetry with respect to the origin . indeed , for the symmetric case :",
    "we have @xmath136 then , due to the symmetry , we get @xmath137 and the transcendental condition  ( [ eq:1.9 ] ) is fulfilled automatically . for the algebraic condition in ( [ eq:1.12]-1 ) we have @xmath138 there are two ways to keep the symmetry : to put the double zero @xmath106 of the discriminant @xmath126 at the point at infinity or at the origin . in order to get the set @xmath139",
    "corresponding to the asymptotics of the diagonal hermite - pad approximants for we choose @xmath140 .",
    "then the vanishing of the coefficient of @xmath141 of @xmath126 gives the explicit expression for the unknown parameter @xmath142 and for the extra branch points of @xmath31 ( the so - called _ soft edges _ ) @xmath143 in figure  [ n1 ] we have given examples of the set @xmath139 for the algebraic curve of genus 1 for the following symmetric input data :    1 .",

    "b. beckermann suggested a numerical method to find the unknown parameters @xmath85 using a geometrical structure of the set @xmath139 .",
    "the idea of the method is simple .",
    "you start from some approximate values @xmath153 for @xmath85 and from each branch point of the corresponding algebraic function @xmath154 you draw the elements of the set @xmath139 , using the trajectories of the quadratic differentials . then an optimization procedure is used to reach a coincidence of the corresponding trajectories which started from different branch points .",
    "this numerical method works only for functions @xmath31 of genus 2 , because these curves are in generic position among the curves defined by  .",
