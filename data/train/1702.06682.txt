    "invention of superconductivity in fe - based compounds not only introduced a drastic change in the belief that fe is inimical to superconductivity due to the presence of strong local magnetic moment associated with fe atom but also recreate a glimpse of hope for developing a complete generalized theory of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of these fe - based superconductors ( scs ) from a fundamental point of view , is that superconductivity may arise from magnetic fluctuation or orbital fluctuation @xcite .",
    "however , the glue to the electron - electron attraction or more precisely pairing mechanism in these fe - based scs is far from being settled @xcite .",
    "phase diagrams of fe - based scs establish the manifestation of various exotic phases like spin density wave ( sdw ) , orbital order , nematic order , structural transition _ etc .",
    "various physical properties including superconductivity of these fe - based scs are very much sensitive to temperature , pressure as well as doping concentration as evident from phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "influence of structural parameters on the superconducting as well as on other exotic phases is well established through extensive theoretical and experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "magnetic ( antiferromagnetic spin ) fluctuation in high t@xmath2 cuprates provide pairing in d@xmath3 channel whereas in fe - based superconductors it is believed to provide s@xmath4 pairing symmetry @xcite .",
    "the quantity that may be used as an indicator of magnetic fluctuation in metallic systems , is stoner factor .",
    "although stoner theory is formulated for ferromagnetic instability , it can also be applied for anti - ferromagnetic systems @xcite .",
    "+ broadly , there exists about six invented families of fe - based scs @xcite . among all these families",
    "122 family is the most studied one both theoretically and experimentally largely because of availability of high quality single crystals in this family .",
    "the generalized chemical formula of 122 family is mfe@xmath0x@xmath0 , where m@xmath5ba , k , ca , sr and x@xmath5as , p. the phase diagrams of 122 family exhibit a large number of diversities in the physical properties @xcite . for example , superconductivity emerges in the electron doped systems ( _ e.g. , _ replacing co by fe ) with a very small doping concentration ( @xmath6@xmath7% ) @xcite whereas the same arises in hole doped systems with higher doping concentration ( @xmath6@xmath8% ) @xcite . on the other hand , for the case of iso - electronic ru doping at the fe site",
    ", superconductivity appears at about 50% ru doping concentration @xcite which is quite high compared to other doped 122 systems .",
    "another qualitatively distinct diversity in the phase diagram of 122 system is observed in case of na doped ba122 system @xcite .",
    "_ displayed the appearance of an additional c@xmath9 ( tetragonal ) phase well inside the orthorhombic phase in ba@xmath10na@xmath11fe@xmath0as@xmath0 system at the boundary between superconductivity and sdw ( stripe antiferromagnetism ) which is different from the previous observations of re - entrant tetragonal phase in electron - doped compounds @xcite and has many important consequences .",
    "the role of various structural parameters specially z@xmath1 ( fractional z co - ordinate of as atom ) or anion height ( height of the as atom from the fe plane ) in superconductivity , magnetism and structural transition is indispensable @xcite . however",
    "the inter - relationship among superconductivity , magnetic order , nematic order , orbital order and structural transition is under thorough investigations both theoretically as well as experimentally @xcite .",
    "the presence of magnetic fluctuation in these fe - based systems is probed by magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath12 )",
    ". a large number of theoretical and experimental works are available in the literature addressing the role of magnetic fluctuation in superconductivity and other observed physical properties of fe - based scs @xcite .",
    "an important finding of the present work is that the stoner factor of various 122 material ( that may model magnetic fluctuation ) varies with doping in the same fashion as that of the pnictide height or z@xmath1 .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) , in its most simple implementation [ the local-(spin)-density - approximation ( l(s)da ) ] is in principle an exact theory to estimate the ground state properties of any system .",
    "it is now well established that lsda and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) approach , which does not take into account the effect of near - critical fluctuations on the long - range magnetism , fails to predict accurate electronic structures for itinerant magnetic system near quantum critical point .",
    "a significant amount of effort has been made to introduce these fluctuations within first principles dft method @xcite .",
    "stoner factor is a parameter which mimic the presence of magnetic instability in a system and can be calculated within lsda approach as shown in ref @xcite .",
    "however no thorough comprehensive investigations , either theoretically or experimentally exist as to how stoner factor is being modified due to various kinds of dopings and temperature .",
    "in this paper we present a comprehensive picture of stoner factor for various 122 fe - based systems as a function of doping concentration from first principles simulations .",

    "we have found that stoner factors get modified qualitatively differently for different kinds of doping .",
    "for example , in case of electron doping ( co doping at the fe site ) and iso - valent doping ( ru doping at fe site as well as p doping at as site ) , stoner factor gradually decreases with increasing doping concentration . on the other hand , exactly opposite trend in the behaviour of stoner factor",
    "is observed in case of hole doped systems ( k / na doping at the ba site ) .",
    "this diversity in the behaviour of stoner factor is then analysed in the light of calculated nature of the fss of these systems for various doped cases .",
    "the method of calculations , including the evaluation of stoner factor for various doped systems require magnitude of dos at the fermi level which are obtained through detailed first principles simulation and are discussed in the forthcoming theoretical method section .",
    "an important speciality of our simulation results is that we use exact experimentally determined structural parameters of various doped systems as input which are being kept intact . as a consequence of that ,",
    "presented results are very much realistic .",
    "in the succeeding section we present the variation of stoner factor with doping concentration for many doped materials of 122 family of fe - based scs .",

    "electronic exchange correlation is treated under the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) using perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that density funtional theory within local density approximation ( lda ) as well as generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) was unable to optimize the experimental value of @xmath13 ( fractional co - ordinate of as ) with desired accuracy @xcite .",
    "in fact , the optimized value of @xmath13 is about 0.1 to 0.15  smaller than that of the experimental one .",

    "the main effect on the electronic structure from finite temperature / doping is the underlying crystal structure , and the average crystal structure can usually be reliably determined from the diffraction experiment at a given doping .    in order to dope the system , we use two theoretical methods : ( 1 ) virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) @xcite ( 2 ) super - cell .",
    "these two methods are used to prepare various doped ba122 and sr122 systems as per requirement .",
    "for example , we use super - cell method for calculating the dos as well as the fss of ru doped 122 systems because the vca method is unable to produce accurate electronic structures in the higher doping regime for these systems .",
    "on the contrary , we employed vca method to dope k , na and p in ba122 system .",
    "the detailed discussion about the application of vca and super - cell methods for various doped 122 systems can be found in ref @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the vca method , developed by bellaiche and vanderbilt @xcite based on weighted averaging of pseudopotentials .",
    "it should be noted that although dos of co doped 122 systems are calculated using super - cell method , fss are calculated within vca method to handle the small percentage of doping in the primitive unit cell . moreover ,",

    "we have also calculated the fss of co doped ba122 system within vca method .",
    "our calculated fss also provide a clear indication of more 3d like fss with higher co doping concentration .",
    "this 3d like fss work against nesting and results in suppression of magnetic order ( sdw ) . since stoner factor",
    "is intimately related to magnetic fluctuation or magnetic instability , reduction of stoner factor with increasing co doping concentration gives a clear indication of depletion of possible `` magnetic fluctuation '' in the system with the introduction of co. this is consistent with the evolution of calculated fss as a function of doping .",
    "now we move to the case of iso - electronic doping at fe site ( ru doping at fe site of ba122 and sr122 systems ) . for both the systems with increasing doping concentration z@xmath1 decreases as shown in fig.[stoner - ru]b and fig.[stoner - ru]d . in fig.[stoner - ru]a and",
    "fig.[stoner - ru]c atom projected dos at the fermi level for ru and fe atoms as well as stoner factor are shown as a function of ru doping concentration for tetragonal sr122 and ba122 systems respectively . for both the cases stoner factor decreases with increasing ru doping concentration in a very similar manner .",
    "we have also performed the fs calculation for ru doped sr122 system within supercell method for 50% ru doping case .",
    "we find that for 122 system 50% ru doping modifies the fss from 2d like to more 3d like , which is consistent with previous theoretical and experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "this in - turn degrades the nesting of fss and triggers superconductivity in the systems by means of suppression of sdw order or magnetic order .",
    "this again creates an impression of curtailment of magnetic order with increasing ru doping concentration , which is also consistent with the calculated variation of stoner factor with ru doping .",
    "as far as our fs calculation is concerned , upto 50% ru doping in sr122 system , no significant moderation is observed in the fs topology in contrast to ba122 system .",
    "however srru@xmath0as@xmath0 has completely 3d like fss just like baru@xmath0as@xmath0 system , presented in fig.[fs - ru]c . in fig.[fs - ru]d we depict the calculated fss of 50% ru doped sr122 system within vca method .",

    "with 50% ru doping there is no significant change in the fs topology but most of the fss of 100% ru doped",

    "next we calculate the evolution of stoner factor for k , na and p doped ba122 system with increasing doping concentration . in fig.[stoner - tetra]a , c the variation of stoner factor as a function of doping concentration has been shown for k and p doped tetragonal ba122 systems respectively . in fig.[stoner - tetra]b , [ stoner - tetra]f the variation of z@xmath1 with doping concentration is also presented for the above mentioned systems respectively .",
    "calculated evaluation of stoner factors in the orthorhombic ba122 systems as a function of k , na and p doping concentrations also show similar trends as that of the tetragonal k , na and p doped ba122 systems , shown in fig.[stoner - p - k - na ] . in fig.[stoner - p - k - na]b and [ stoner - p - k - na]f ,",
    "the variation of z@xmath1 with doping concentration is also presented for the same systems respectively . in case of k and na doped systems ( hole doped ) stoner factor increases with the increase of doping concentration which also corroborates well with the nature of the calculated fss , shown in fig.[fs - k ] and [ fs - na ] .",
    "although exactly opposite trends in the behaviour of z@xmath1 with doping concentration ( experimental ) is observed in case of k and na doping ( see fig[stoner - p - k - na]b and d ) which makes the na doped system different from other hole doped 122 systems . for p doped system both z@xmath1 and stoner factor decreases with increasing doping concentration , which indicate reduction of magnetic instability with p doping .",
    "so in general , the stoner factors of various 122 systems follow the variation of z@xmath1 with doping except in the case of k doped ba122 system where the variation of z@xmath1 with doping is not well defined .",
    "experimental data of z@xmath1 for k doped ba122 is not as consistent ( probably accurate ) compared to that for the other doped 122 family of compounds ( see fig .",
    "[ stoner - p - k - na]b , d ) .",
    "since our theoretical calculation is based on the experimental crystallographic data as input , the calculated electronic structure differs from general observation ( actually the experimental inconsistency in z@xmath1 with doping is reflected in the calculated results ) . in case of ba@xmath10k@xmath11fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,",
    "thus , comparison of stoner factor with z@xmath1 would not be a correct quantity to look into but the fe - as bond length as a function of doping concentration .",
    "actually , stoner factor universally follows the variation of fe - as bond length for various types of doping . in case of hole doping ,",
    "stoner factor inversely follows fe - as bond length with the variation of doping concentration . on the other hand , in the case of electron doping",
    ", stoner factor follows the doping dependent behaviour of fe - as bond length . in order to understand universality in the behaviour of stoner factor and z@xmath1/fe - as bond length of hole doped ba122 ,",
    "we shed more light into the other structural parameters . to elucidate the inconsistency in the behaviour of stoner factor and z@xmath1 in k doped ba122",
    ", we introduce in plane and out of plane as - as distances which also play very important and crucial role .",
    "size of the ba atom ( 2.22 ) [ atomic radius in metallic bonding ] is larger than na atom ( 1.86 ) but smaller than k atom ( 2.27 ) . because of this reason , with the substitution of k atom in place of ba atom , out of plane as - as distance increases and exactly opposite behaviour in the out of plane as - as distance",
    "is observed in the case of na substitution at ba site .",
    "it should also be noted that the c - axis increases with the increasing doping concentration for both na and k doping ( in case of na doped ba122 materials c - axis increases with doping up to certain doping concentration and after that it decreases ) .",
    "this qualitatively explains the observed behaviour of z@xmath1 with doping for k and na doped ba122 systems @xcite .",
    "but in both the cases fe - as bond length decreases with increasing doping concentration . calculated stoner factors for k / na / p doped 122 systems using super - cell approach also follow the same trends as that of the calculated one within vca method .",
    "calculated fss also become more and more 3d like with increasing p doping concentration , which is consistent with the suppression of magnetic order as observed in experiments ( see fig.[fs - p ] ) . on the contrary to all other cases of doping",
    ", hole doping makes the fss more 2d like which actually helps having larger degree of nesting of fss .",
    "this increasing trend of stoner factor with doping , may be related to the more 2d like fss of the hole doped 122 systems that enhances nesting segments .",
    "in all these 122 systems , superconductivity emerges into the system with certain percentage of doping concentration ( small or large ) . on the contrary to other",
    "122 fe - based scs , stoner factor of hole doped 122 systems ( k / na doped ) display distinctly different behaviour . in these cases",
    "only , the stoner factor increases with increasing doping concentration which indicate that , these systems become more and more unstable against magnetic instability .",
    "so in these hole doped 122 systems , superconductivity arises at the same moment when magnetic instability also dominates .",
    "we have also studied the behaviour of stoner factor in presence of electron correlation which can be introduced through lda+u calculation within dft .",
    "since fe based scs specially 122 systems are weakly correlated , we restrict our lda+u calculation for a small value of u , which defines the strength of correlation ( u=0.5 and u=1 ) . in fig.[stoner - u ] the variation of stoner factor with doping concentration for various u values ( u=0.5 and u=1 ) are depicted for bafe@xmath0(as@xmath10p@xmath11)@xmath0 and ba@xmath10na@xmath11fe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems in the orthorhombic phase .",
    "it is to be noted here that with the introduction of u , stoner factor decreases for both the cases but shows very similar trends with doping concentration as that in the case of u=0 .",
    "this study ( of lda+u ) has also been extended to all other materials presented in this work .",
    "the reduction of stoner factor with correlation is consistent with the current literature @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted here that k - doped ba122 systems have the highest superconducting transition temperature ( t@xmath2 ) among all other fe - based scs in ambient condition .",
    "this may give some impression that superconductivity in these systems is intimately related to magnetic order and magnetic fluctuations . on the whole , our study provides a clear view about the variation of stoner factor as a function of doping for all variety of doped 122 fe - based scs .",
    "we also explain the observed diversities in the behaviour of various doped 122 systems by presenting calculated fss .",
    "point ( centre of the bz ) and two electron like fss around x point ( four corners of the bz ) . with increasing doping concentration hole like",

    "with increasing doping concentration the fss are more 3d like.,width=283,height=264 ]    the phase diagram of the iron pnictides reveals that the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath2 usually shows a dome - like relation with doping .",
    "should the stoner factor vary with doping in the fashion as tc in phase diagrams ?",
    "one should be aware of the fact that both temperature and doping plays a very important role in any phase diagram .",
    "in fact in phase diagram , both temperature and doping dependencies of various phases like spin density wave , superconducting phase _ etc .",
    "_ , are known for various fe based superconductors . however ,",
    "in our first principles electronic structure calculations , we use experimentally measured doping dependent lattice parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , z@xmath1 ) at a fixed temperature as input .",
    "that is why our calculated stoner factor does not contain any temperature dependencies ( only doping dependency ) . in general , z@xmath1 ( as well as other structural parameters ) has a very sensitive temperature dependencies .",
    "for example , in our earlier work we have shown in ru doped ba122 system , structural parameters including z@xmath1 are highly sensitive to temperature @xcite .",
    "when such a temperature dependency was included in the electronic structure calculation by us in the past , the temperature dependency of stoner factor did reproduce the experimental magnetic fluctuation behaviour @xcite . in the current perspective where we discuss detailed behaviour of stoner factor over a wide doping ranges for a number of doped-122 family , clean crystallographic data , particularly z@xmath1 as a function of both , doping and temperature",
    "is not available . as a result",
    "such a calculation of stoner factor as a function doping as well as temperature is only a future possibility .",
    "that is why the stoner factor does not show dome like behaviour .",
    "it is well documented that the magnetic fluctuation plays a significant role in superconductivity of fe - based scs .",
    "stoner factor is the precursor of magnetic fluctuation or magnetic instability in a system .",
    "we have presented in detail the modification of stoner factor with doping concentration for various doped 122 fe - based scs .",
    "vca as well as super - cell methods are employed to dope these materials theoretically to calculate dos and fss of doped 122 compounds .",
    "diversities in the behaviour of stoner factor with varying doping concentrations for various nature of doped 122 systems are discussed . in case of ru ( iso - electronic)/co ( electron ) doped systems ,",
    "stoner factor decreases with increasing ru / co concentration which is compatible with the calculated fss .",
    "same trends in the behaviour of stoner factor and fss are also observed in the case of other iso - electronic doping , p doping at the as site . on the other hand , in case of hole doped systems ( na / k doping at the ba site ) stoner factor increases with increasing doping concentration which is also consistent with the corresponding modifications in the calculated fss for various doping concentrations .",
    "remarkably , we find that the stoner factor follows the variation as that of the z@xmath1 with doping .",
    "larger the pnictide height larger is the stoner factor as well as larger degree of the fermi surface nesting , larger the value of stoner factor and vice versa .",
    "sensitive dependence of superconducting t@xmath2 with anion height was established earlier @xcite but our present work clearly establishes the same for stoner factor or magnetic fluctuation . as a whole",
    "this work provide a comprehensive study of stoner factor ( magnetic instability ) for various doped 122 fe - based scs .",
