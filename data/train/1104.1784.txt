    "light - weight metal borohydrides remain in the spotlight of hydrogen - storage research due to their high gravimetric hydrogen content and abundance of the constituent elements .",
    "@xcite li , mg , and ca tetraborohydrides ( @xmath4(bh@xmath0)@xmath5 ) hold over 12 wt% of h , but their excessive thermodynamic stability presently renders these materials unsuitable for practical reversible hydrogen - storage solutions .",
    "@xcite in an effort to adjust the formation enthalpies and the decomposition temperatures , several groups have suggested destabilization routes via reactions with other hydrides ( see e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite ) or synthesis of mixed metal tetraborohydrides ( e.g.  li - cu ) @xcite .",
    "detailed knowledge of materials ground states becomes essential , as the possibility of new compound formation depends on small free energy differences for the phases involved .",
    "metal tetraborohydrides are held together primarily by a combination of covalent ( b - h ) and ionic ( [ @xmath4]@xmath7-[bh@xmath0]@xmath9 ) interactions .",
    "packing of the fairly rigid [ bh@xmath0]@xmath10 units and [ @xmath4]@xmath7 ions into crystalline structures depends strongly on the valency and size of the metal atom , with exceptionally complex configurations occurring for the medium - sized divalent magnesium .",
    "based on the experimental data , the ground states below and above @xmath11 k , namely @xmath2 and @xmath12 , have been assigned space groups p6@xmath322 ( 330 atoms / u.c . ) @xcite and fddd ( 704 atoms / u.c . ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "strikingly , numerous density functional theory ( dft ) studies @xcite have converged on a completely unrelated f222 structure as the most stable low-@xmath13 polymorph .",
    "@xcite recently , it has been pointed out @xcite that the lack of a proper description of dispersion forces in the standard dft approach may be a factor favoring low - density f222 structure over the experimental @xmath2 phase .    in this study",
    "we take a key step towards resolving the existing discrepancy : we demonstrate that the weak dispersive interactions , important in other ionic ( kcl and kbr ) @xcite and covalent - ionic ( mg(oh)@xmath1 and ca(oh)@xmath1 ) @xcite systems , indeed play a critical role in defining the mg(bh@xmath0)@xmath1 ground state .",
    "we show that the commonly used ceperley - alder @xcite or perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite functionals artificially stabilize configurations with unusually high and low density , respectively .",
    "inclusion of the dispersive contributions via a nonlocal van der waals density functional ( vdw - df ) @xcite or as a semi - empirical pbe - d * correction @xcite changes the relative stability of considered structures and favors the layered motif @xcite occurring in related @xmath2-mg(bh@xmath0)@xmath1 and mn(bh@xmath0)@xmath1 prototypes .",

    "an efficient fft formulation of vdw - df @xcite has allowed us to calculate the @xmath14 k relative stability for mg(bh@xmath0)@xmath1 structures of unprecedented size ( up to 330 atom / u.c . ) .",
    "calculation of the gibbs energy vibrational contributions at finite temperatures is much more computationally demanding . in order to examine the relative stability as a function of temperature",
    "we have employed a semi - empirical method developed by grimme @xcite , that includes the long - range contributions via damped pairwise @xmath15 terms at a negligible cost compared to standard dft calculations .",
    "the method has gained popularity providing an improved description of molecular systems .",

    "the necessity to treat mg(bh@xmath0)@xmath1 beyond the standard dft approximations becomes evident when the pbe functional shows virtually no interlayer binding for the exemplary layered p@xmath20m1 phase ( fig .",
    "the lack of a noticeable covalent or electrostatic interaction between the layers is a result of the particular packing of the bh@xmath0 tetrahedra that makes the interlayer interface consist of two parallel sheets of hydrogen atoms already engaged in covalent b - h bonds .",
    "introduction of the vdw interactions via vdw - df , pbe - d , and pbe - d * leads to interlayer cohesions of 0.123 , 0.076 , and 0.068 ev / bh@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the size of the extra binding is substantial considering that the reported energy difference between the experimental ( @xmath2 ) and theoretical ( f222 ) ground states within pbe is only 0.024 ev / bh@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the lda , known to mimic dispersive interactions ( e.g. , in graphite @xcite ) , also gives a 0.058 ev / bh@xmath0 binding , but  as we show below  should not be used as a substitute for a properly constructed nonlocal functional .",
    "we compare the performance of the five different methods , pbe , lda , pbe - d , pbe - d * , and vdw - df , by plotting the relative stability and compound density for selected structures in fig .  2",

    "a number of unexpected features emerge as we examine the total energy data moving from left to right in fig .",
    "at the pbe level , we find the highest stability of the least compact f222 phase , in agreement with ref .",
    "however , in the lda , arguably better suited for simulating mg(bh@xmath0)@xmath1 based on our test in fig .  1 , there is a dramatic change in the ordering of the polymorphs enthalpies with the ground state now being the most compact i4@xmath3/acd structure .",
    "it is evident that , compared to pbe , the lda favors higher packing : it lowers the relative enthalpy of the two densest p@xmath20m1 and i4@xmath3/acd polymorphs by 0.134 and 0.120 ev / bh@xmath0 , respectively , and increases the relative enthalpy of the sparsest f222 by 0.083 ev / bh@xmath0 .",

    "in fact , there is more agreement between the lda vs pbe - d rather than the pbe vs pbe - d sets .",
    "the p@xmath20m1 polymorph gets an even larger 0.217 ev / bh@xmath0 gain in relative stability dropping below @xmath2 by 0.023 ev / bh@xmath0 , which may look surprising given the similar size of the interlayer binding for this structure in lda and pbe - d ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "to help explain this result we plot pairwise interaction strengths ( fig .",
    "3 g ) and histograms of nearest neighbors ( nns ) for relevant structures ( fig .",
    "it has been discussed @xcite that introduction of the dispersive interactions ` on top ' of dft requires a smooth cut - off of the attractive @xmath45 terms just below the typical vdw distances to avoid their unphysical contributions at short @xmath46 .",
    "panels @xmath43 and @xmath47 in fig .  3 show that a number of intralayer distances in p@xmath20m1 ( marked with stars ) happen to fall in the critical range , around the corresponding @xmath48 values fitted to molecular datasets , which can give rise to artificially strong binding .",
    "the suggested adjustment of the vdw parameters within pbe - d * @xcite helps reduce the vdw overbinding for the dense p@xmath20m1 and i4@xmath3/acd structures and for the first time we observe the @xmath2-phase to be the most stable polymorph among the considered diverse set of candidates , albeit by a small margin .",
    "the classical pairwise representation of the vdw corrections in the grimme approach ( eq .",
    "1 ) makes it possible to examine the individual vdw contributions . according to fig .",
    "3h , the increase in @xmath49 values ( from 1.001 , 1.485 , 1.364   to 1.301 , 1.559 , 1.432   for @xmath50 = h ,",
    "b , mg , respectively ) greatly diminishes the direct h - h interaction .",
    "however , fig .",
    "4 shows that the bh@xmath0-bh@xmath0 interaction still dominates the long - range binding , which  not unexpectedly  scales almost linearly with the crystal density .",
    "the second largest contribution , mg - bh@xmath0 , deviates from linear dependence due to a variable coordination of mg ions .",
    "the classical attractive terms cause up to @xmath51 volume reduction compared to structures optimized with pbe .",
    "finally , the vdw - df method correctly predicts @xmath2 to be the low-@xmath13 ground state and separates it from all other unrelated structures by a considerable 0.040 ev / bh@xmath0 ; the near degeneracy of @xmath2 and p3@xmath312 ( mn(bh@xmath0)@xmath1 prototype ) can be traced to the close structural relationship between the two layered structures discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the method places the hypothetical f222 structure 0.076 ev / bh@xmath0 above @xmath2 and differentiates between the two high - density 2d p@xmath20m1 and 3d i4@xmath3/acd structures by improving the stability of just the latter .",
    "this suggests that the overestimation of the intralayer binding in the difficult p@xmath20m1 case might still not be fully corrected within pbe - d*. comparison of crystal densities for pbe - d * and vdw - df in fig .",
    "2d shows that the latter results in less compact structures ; the effect of the nonlocal correlations on the volume change is not easy to quantify because the method is based on the exchange and correlation functionals taken from revpbe @xcite and lda , respectively .",
    "the calculated vdw - df value of @xmath52 g@xmath53cm@xmath42 for the @xmath2 phase is 3% below the experimental value which is consistent with a typical 1% overestimation of bond lengths for gga - based methods .",
    "inclusion of finite temperature contributions due to the vibrational entropy is orders of magnitude more expensive than the calculation of the total energy at zero temperature .",
    "we estimate the vibrational corrections using two dft - based methods , pbe - d and pbe - d * , which is computationally feasible and allows us to show directly the effect of the vdw interactions .",
    "hessian matrices were calculated in a numerical fashion from analitycal forces and atomic displacements for sufficiently large supercells ( at least 88 atoms).@xcite according to our extensive tests for mg(bh@xmath0)@xmath1 , the 0.00133 displacements and the 10@xmath56 ev scf energy convergence criterion ensured minimal errors ( @xmath25 10 @xmath17 ) for the calculated frequencies coming from the unharmonic effects and numerical factors .",
    "@xmath57-mesh for the dynamical matrices was typically two times denser than the @xmath58-mesh for the energy calculations in each direction .",
    "the analitycal forces at the pbe level were found with vasp for fully relaxed polymorph structures .",
    "the analytical forces at the pbe - d * level were calculated using qmpot linked with vasp . in this case , since qmpot does not currently offer stress calculations , the structures were optimized as follows : the unit cells were first fully relaxed with pwscf and then the ionic positions were re - optimized with a combination of qmpot and vasp .",
