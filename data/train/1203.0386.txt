    "the recent confirmation of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) suppression in the cosmic ray energy spectrum @xcite indicates that the ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) with energies above the gzk cutoff , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , mostly come from relatively close ( within the gzk radius , @xmath13 ) extragalactic sources .",
    "however , the identification of the uhecr sources is far from clear .",
    "recent efforts to identify the sources are based on the belief that the intergalactic magnetic fields are not so strong that they do nt alter significantly the trajectories of uhecr with these highest energy and thus the arrival directions of uhecr keep some correlations with the source distribution .",
    "an important step toward this direction is to check the correlation between the uhecr arrival directions and the large scale structures manifested in the galaxy distribution .",
    "it was studied by several groups @xcite and the results are not quite conclusive yet .",
    "the positive result will provide the basis for the further study of correlations between the uhecr and specific classes of astrophysical objects .",
    "another important progress toward this direction was the correlation between arrival directions of uhecr and nearby active galactic nuclei ( agn ) reported by the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite .",
    "though further analysis with more data weakened the significance of the correlation @xcite , it still remains as an important issue .",
    "the correlation between the uhecr arrival directions and the astrophysical objects has been studied in many ways @xcite .",
    "the reason why we have to rely on the statistical methods are that the poor understanding of the intergalactic magnetic fields makes the exact identification of the source of each uhecr difficult and that the number of observed uhecr events is smaller than the that of the astrophysical objects which are candidate sources . in our previous paper @xcite , we developed new statistical test methods based on the previously used methods and combine them to estimate the significance of correlation reliably .",
    "the basic idea is that we reduce the two - dimensional distribution of arrival directions to the one - dimensional probability distributions , which can be compared by using the well - known kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "we proposed a few reduced one - dimensional distributions suitable for the test of correlation between the uhecr arrival directions and the point sources of uhecr , which will be restated in detail in section  [ sec3 ] . to make the statistical test more definite",
    ", we use the simple agn model for the uhecr sources again .",
    "this model assumes that a fraction of uhecr above a certain energy cutoff are originated from the agn lying within a certain distance cut .",
    "the remaining fraction is the isotropic component accounting for the contribution from the sources lying outside of the distance cut .",
    "the model also assumes , for simplicity , that all selected agn have the equal luminosity and smearing angle of uhecr . for this simple agn model for uhecr sources ,",
    "our test method showed that the correlation between uhecr in the pao data released in 2007 and agn listed in the 12th edition of vron - cetty and vron ( vcv ) catalog is much stronger than the simple isotropic distribution of uhecr , but also that the correlation is not strong enough to support the hypothesis that uhecr are completely originated from agn .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit this for two reasons .",
    "firstly , there appeared the updated data sets both for uhecr and for agn .",
    "we use the updated agn data listed in the 13th edition of vcv catalog @xcite and the updated uhecr data reported by pao in 2010 @xcite .",
    "the 13th edition of vcv catalog published in 2010 is a compilation of all known agn from a variety of catalogs , which contains 133,336 quasars , 1,374 bl lac objects , and 34,231 active galaxies , making a total of 168,941 .",
    "especially , the number of objects lying within the gzk radius ( @xmath14 ) which are used for the test of correlation with uhecr is 862 , which is larger by about 200 than that of the previous version of catalog .",
    "pao also published the updated data set in 2010 .",
    "they released 69 uhecr events collected by the surface detector from 2004 january 1 to 2009 december 31 .",
    "the data have energies above @xmath15 and zenith angles within @xmath16 .",
    "the energy threshold is changed because pao refined the reconstruction algorithms ; however , the updated data include all previous uhecr events listed in the previous paper .",
    "secondly and more importantly , in the previous paper the significance estimation in the statistical test was done in an incorrect way , thus resulted in too strong constraints on the simple agn model .",
    "now , we performed the monte - carlo simulations to get the correct significance estimations .",
    "this results in the significant change in the conclusion concerning the isotropy of uhecr events .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we describe the simple agn model for the uhecr sources and the details needed for the generation of monte - carlo events for the model and the statistical comparison with the observed data . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we explain in detail our statistical methods for comparing two distributions of arrival directions .",
    "the results of our correlation analysis are presented in section [ sec4 ] and discussion and conclusion follow in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "we examine the plausibility of the idea that agn are the main sources of uhecr through the statistical comparison of the arrival direction distribution of observed uhecr data and that expected from the agn source model . to make the implications and the limitations of our analysis more definite , we need to clearly state the agn model for uhecr sources . in this section , we describe the details of the simple agn model for uhecr sources which is adopted for the correlation test of agn and uhecr in this paper .    for the comparison with the observations , we use the uhecr data with",
    "energies higher than a certain energy cut @xmath17 .",
    "we take @xmath17 to be higher than the gzk cutoff for the proton , @xmath18 .",
    "the advantages of using the high value of energy cut @xmath17 for uhecr data are that we can minimize the deflection due to the intergalactic magnetic fields and that we can reduce the isotropic background contribution . at very high energies ,",
    "most of the isotropic background contribution must come from the far distant astrophysical object . by taking the energy cut above the gzk cutoff",
    ", we can restrict most of possible sources to be within the gzk radius which is around @xmath19 and reduce this contributions .",
    "of course , the disadvantage is that the number of uhecr data becomes small , which reduces the statistical power .",
    "so we need to make a compromise in - between .",
    "we use the uhecr data released by pao in 2010 @xcite .",
    "the released data set contains 69 uhecr with energy higher than @xmath15 . to fully use the released data , we take the energy cut @xmath20 .    for our analysis , we use agn listed in the 13th edition of vcv catalog @xcite .",
    "we select agn within a certain distance cut @xmath21 . because we apply the energy cut to uhecr data which is higher than the gzk cutoff ,",
    "most of probable sources of them are expected to lie within the gzk radius , @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we take @xmath21 to be @xmath19 ( corresponding to the redshift @xmath23 ) .",
    "the other reason why we pick up @xmath19 as our cutoff distance is that the agn distribution in the vcv catalog with distance larger than @xmath19 tends to be incomplete much more than that inside @xmath19 .",
    "the original number of agn within @xmath19 in the vcv catalog is 865 .",
    "this includes 3 agn with zero redshift , which are problematic to be included in our analysis .",
    "thus , we eliminate these three agn from our agn data set and the remaining 862 agn will be used in our analysis .",

    "the solid red line represents the boundaries of the sky covered by pao experiments .",
    "the blue crosses ( @xmath25 ) represent the locations of agn with distance @xmath26 taken from the 13th edition of vcv catalog .",

    "the smearing effect varies agn by agn in general .",
    "the deflection by the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) depends on the energy of the particle , the propagation distance , the average size of the patches , and the magnetic field strength .",
    "therefore , it has the model dependence .",
    "in addition , it is known that the deflection by the extragalactic magnetic fields would not affect the uhecr propagation significantly , because the deflection angle not much larger than the angular resolution of the uhecr observation .",
    "therefore , we do not take the specific gmf model in our analysis .",
    "rather , we assume that each agn has a gaussian flux distribution with a certain angular width .",
    "then the uhecr flux from all agn is given by @xmath29 } { n(\\theta_{sj})}\\ , , \\label{uhecr - flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the uhecr luminosity , @xmath31 is the distance , @xmath32 is the angle between the direction @xmath33 and the @xmath34-th agn , @xmath35 is the smearing angle of the @xmath34-th agn , and @xmath36 $ ] is the normalization of smearing function . for small @xmath3 , @xmath37 and for large @xmath3 , @xmath38 . just for simplicity , we assume that all agn have the same uhecr luminosity , @xmath39 , and the same smearing angle , @xmath40 .",
    "the value of @xmath41 will be fixed by the total number of uhecr contributed by agn .",
    "the smearing angle , @xmath3 , is taken to be a free parameter , while its fiducial value is taken to be @xmath42 @xcite , as we assume that the primary particle of uhecr is the proton in this analysis .",
    "the uhecr with energy above the energy cut @xmath20 still can come from the sources lying outside the distance cut @xmath43 , and we want to take it into account in the uhecr source model .",
    "we consider that a certain fraction of uhecr with energy above @xmath17 is originated from the agn within a distance @xmath21 , while the remaining fraction of them is from the isotropically distributed background contributions .",
    "we assume that the isotropic background components consist of the uhecr coming from the outside of @xmath43 and the isotropically distributed contributions which is inside the distance cut .",
    "thus , the expected flux at a given arrival direction @xmath33 is the sum of two contributions , @xmath44 now we define the agn fraction @xmath2 to be @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the average agn - contributed flux .",
    "note that the definition of the agn fraction is somewhat different from that defined in our previous work .",
    "there , the agn fraction was defined to be the ratio of agn - originated uhecr after considering the exposure of the detector array .",
    "this actual fraction of agn contribution at a given detector is generally different from @xmath2 because it depends on the location of the detector relative to the source distribution and on the size of the smearing angle .",
    "we found that for the pao site considering the exposure makes the actual agn fraction a little bit smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "now the uhecr flux can be written as @xmath47 } { n(\\theta_s)\\sum_jd_j^{-2 } } + ( 1-f_a)\\overline{f},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 .",
    "out of three parameters @xmath41 , @xmath3 , and @xmath49 , the agn fraction @xmath2 and the smearing angle @xmath3 are treated as the free parameters of the model , while the average flux @xmath50 is fixed by the total number of uhecr events .",
    "if the source distribution is known , the fraction of uhecr with @xmath51 coming from the sources with @xmath52 can be estimated as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath21 by solving the cosmic ray propagation equation .",
    "for the uniform distribution of equal sources , @xmath20 and @xmath43 , the estimated value is around @xmath53 @xcite , and we will take this value as the fiducial value of @xmath2 .    however",
    ", this value would change under the different distribution of sources , therefore , we want to sweep @xmath2 from 0 to 1 in this analysis , considering the general case . also , this can supplement the imperfections of the calculation of the uhecr flux caused by the incompleteness of the vcv catalog and by picking up @xmath19 as our cutoff distance without considering exact attenuation effects .    for the correct comparison of observed arrival directions with the expected ones , we also need to take into account the efficiency of the detector as a function of the arrival direction , which depends on the location and the characteristics of the detector array . for the uhecr with energies above gzk cutoff , considering",
    "the geometric efficiency only is good enough .",
    "it is determined by the location of the detector array and the zenith angle cut .",

    "[ skymap - sim ] , we showed the distributions of mock uhecr data for two different values of the agn fraction , @xmath63 and @xmath6 with the same smearing angle @xmath62 .",
    "we now describe our statistical methods to measure the plausibility of the uhecr source model .",
    "what we obtain through statistical analysis is the probability that the observed uhecr arrival direction distribution originates from the given uhecr source model .",
    "this is achieved by statistically quantifying how similar the observed uhecr arrival direction distribution is to the expected one from the source model .",
    "the correlation studies for this kind of point distribution have been done in many branches of science .",
    "the statistical analysis methods of spatial point pattern are well established @xcite .",
    "one of the most useful methods to compare the point patterns is ripley s @xmath64 and @xmath41 function .",
    "the underlying concept of this function is that we can characterize the distributions by counting the mean number of points of type 1 in a disc of radius @xmath65 centered at the typical point of type 2 .",
    "we can obtain the ripley s @xmath64 function as a function of @xmath65 , then we can compare the function obtained from observed distribution and the theoretically expected one .",
    "the comparison method used by pao @xcite is similar to this method .",
    "they count the number of events within the given angular distance obtained by their exploratory scan",
    ". however , this approach can not avoid the arbitrariness of constraining the radius @xmath65 .",
    "for the appropriate application of ripley s @xmath64 function , one should count the number of events for all radius @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , we tried to develop the methods which shares the same basic idea , but are simpler and intuitive for the spherical data masked by the exposure function . in our previous work @xcite , we developed comparison methods in which the two - dimensional uhecr arrival direction distributions on the sphere is reduced to one - dimensional probability distributions of some sort , so that they can be compared by using the standard kolmogorov - smirnov(ks ) test or its variants such as the anderson - darling ( ad ) test and the kuiper ( kp ) test . in this section",

    "[ rad - decd ] , we show rad and decd of the pao data and compare them with those of the isotropic distribution and of the simple agn model with fiducial parameters @xmath8 and @xmath62 described in the previous section .",
    "rad and decd are normalized as the probability distribution by dividing the count by the total number of data , so that they sum up to 1 .",
    "now we can apply the statistical test for one dimensional distribution such as the ks test , the ad test , and the kp test to measure how similar the distribution obtained from the observed data is to that expected from the model .",
    "all these three tests are based on the cumulative probability distribution ( cpd ) , @xmath69 . though we made bins for plotting the distribution in fig .",
    "[ rad - decd ] , you will easily see that these tests do not involve binning , as we use the cpd .",

    "it is known , in general , that the ks statistic is sensitive around the median , the ad statistic is sensitive on the tails , and kp statistic has equal sensitivities at all values of @xmath83 .    let us apply the ks , kp , and ad tests to compare rad and decd of the pao data and those obtained from the model under consideration . for rad and decd , the number of data in the distribution is same as the number of uhecr data .",
    "thus , @xmath84 , the number of observed uhecr data and @xmath85 , the number of mock uhecr data .",
    "we can make the expected distribution more accurate by increasing the number of mock data @xmath86 from the model under consideration . in the limit @xmath87 ,",

    "the probabilities that rad and decd of the pao data come from the isotropic distribution and the simple agn model with fiducial parameters ( @xmath8 , @xmath62 ) are listed in table  [ p - table ] .",
    "one notable thing is that ad test gives much smaller probabilities than the other comparison methods for rad method .",
    "however , we found that this is a fake caused by the fact that one of the pao data has @xmath90 , the end point of the ra range , by chance and the ad test is very sensitive on the tail .",
    "it makes @xmath74 very large and the probability very small .",
    "note that ra is actually a cyclic variable on a circle .",
    "this fake result can be avoided by shifting the origin of ra coordinate by an arbitrary amount .",
    "in fact , the ks and ad tests are not invariant under this shift , so their results are dependent on the amount of shift .",

    "however , the vcv catalog is an incomplete one in the sense that it is not a catalog obtained from a single observational mission and it does not cover the full sky completely .",
    "therefore , it has a certain limitation to use the vcv catalog for the correlation test .",
    "pao also mentioned this point and they considered the incompleteness of vcv catalog in the galactic plane region . there are 9 uhecr events within @xmath114 from the galactic plane .",
    "when they exclude these data to calibrate the incompleteness of the galactic plane region , the correlation is increased from @xmath107 to @xmath115 , i.e. 21 out of 46 are within the correlation angular window .",
    "it is hard to say that the results are statistically significant .",
    "when we apply this approach to cadd , the best value of the agn fraction is increased slightly to @xmath116 , while the best value of the smearing angle , @xmath117 , is similar to the result for the whole data set .",
    "we can not see the significant effect of incompleteness in the galactic plane region at this step .",
    "also , we can not confirm that these results are caused by the incompleteness of catalog or by the deflection due to the strong magnetic field in galactic plane region .",
    "these possibilities need to be explored further .",
    "our analysis assumed that all agn have the same uhecr luminosity for simplicity .",
    "thus , the relatively close agn dominates over the others in the uhecr flux .",
    "this fact can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ skymap - sim ] , where many red dots representing mock uhecr are clustered around centaurus a ( cen a ) and messier 87 ( m87 ) which are two representative close objects in vcv catalog . if we look at the observed pao uhecr data , the black dots representing observed uhecr are actually clustered around cen a. this supported the strong correlation between uhecr and agn reported by the pao collaboration . on the other hand ,",
    "no such clustering is seen around m87 which is one of the brightest galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "this discrepancy may be a main cause for our main result that both cadd method rules out agn dominance with small smearing angles .",
    "zaw et al .",
    "suggested that this lack of observed uhecr around m87 can be explained by considering the bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "they investigated the bolometric luminosity of agn which are correlated with pao uhecr ( with the criteria for correlation as in @xcite ) and determined the empirical lower bound of bolometric luminosity @xmath118 for uhecr production .",
    "there are many agn with bolometric luminosity lower than the empirical lower bound , i.e. low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) , in the virgo cluster in the vcv catalog and llagn do not have enough power to accelerate uhecr under the conventional agn uhecr acceleration model .",
    "therefore , this can be a possible reason for the uhecr deficiency near the virgo cluster .",
    "statistical tests using cadd for the agn model with types or luminosity taken into account would be good future works in tracing the uhecr origin .    in conclusion , we reexamined the correlation between uhecr and agn using the updated data sets : for uhecr , we used 69 events with energy @xmath0 released in 2010 by pao and for agn , we used 862 agn within the distance @xmath1 listed in the 13th edition of vcv catalog . to make the test hypothesis definite , we built up the simple agn model in which uhecr are originated both from agn , with the fraction @xmath2 , and from the isotropic background .",
    "we treated all agn as equal sources of uhecr .",
    "we also introduced the smearing angle @xmath3 to incorporate the effects of galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "then we compared the arrival direction distributions observed by pao and expected from the model by cadd method .",
    "this reduces the two - dimensional arrival direction distribution to one dimensional probability distribution which reflect the correlation between uhecr and their source candidates so that we can apply the standard ks test and calculate the chance probability that the observed distribution comes from the model .",
    "our results show that cadd method rules out the agn dominance model with a small smearing angle ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) . concerning the isotropy",
    ", cadd shows that the distribution of pao data is marginally consistent with isotropy .",
    "the best fit model lies around the agn fraction @xmath6 and the moderate smearing angle @xmath7 . for the fiducial value @xmath8 , the best probability of cadd was obtained at a rather large smearing angle @xmath9 . in short ,",
    "our results imply that for the whole agn to be viable sources of uhecr , either appreciable amount of additional isotropic background or the large smearing effect is required .",
    "this situation for agn as uhecr sources can be improved by narrowing down the uhecr sources from the whole agn to a certain subclass of agn .",
    "we tried the distance binning as an illustration and found that the agn residing in the distance range @xmath10 have a good correlation with the updated pao data .",
    "this good correlation may be a happening by chance , but may also be an indication that the large scale structures surrounding agn can be important for the production of uhecr . in this regard ,",
    "the research on the possibility that the subclass of agn , for example , @xmath95-ray loud agn @xcite is responsible for uhecr is very interesting .",
