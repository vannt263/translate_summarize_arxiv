    "for a knot diagram @xmath1 of a knot @xmath2 in @xmath3 , d.thurston @xcite introduced a way to decompose @xmath4 into ideal octahedra by placing an octahedron at each crossing and then identifying their faces appropriately along the knot diagram .",
    "one can obtain an ideal triangulation @xmath5 of @xmath6 by dividing each octahedron into ideal tetrahedra .",
    "then we can give a  pseudo - hyperbolic structure \"",
    "on @xmath6 through this ideal triangulation by solving thurston s gluing equations for @xmath5 which require the product of cross - ratios ( or shape parameters ) around each edge of @xmath7 to be @xmath8 . since the cross - ratios determine the shapes of each ideal hyperbolic octahedron and vice versa , these hyperbolic octahedra , giving a pseudo - hyperbolic structure on @xmath6 , will be called a solution .",
    "even though the gluing equations only guarantee that the sum of dihedral angles around each edge is a multiple of @xmath9 , not @xmath9 , one still can consider a ( pseudo- ) developing map of @xmath6 with a holonomy representation as w.thurston did in @xcite , whenever a solution is given .",
    "an octahedral decomposition has been used by several authors very successfully in conjunction with the volume conjecture .",
    "yokota @xcite used a 4-term triangulation @xmath10 of @xmath6 motivated by the optimistic limit of the kashaev invariant presenting the gluing equations as derivatives of a potential function . in a similar manner , cho and",
    "murakami @xcite suggested a 5-term triangulation @xmath11 of @xmath6 applying the optimistic limit to the colored jones polynomial formulation of the state sum of quantum invariant .",
    "they present the gluing equations for @xmath11 in terms of region variables , also called @xmath0-variables , which are non zero complex valued variables assigned to each region of a diagram @xmath1 .",
    "the 5-term triangulation @xmath11 has a nice property that any non trivial boundary parabolic representation of a knot group can be derived from a solution to the gluing equations for @xmath11 as a holonomy @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the 4-term triangulation @xmath10 does not have such property since the octahedron at a crossing in @xmath10 can not be pinched , i.e. , the top and bottom vertices of the octahedron can not coincide , while the octahedron in @xmath11 can .    @xmath12    each solution of the gluing equations gives rise to a holonomy representation of a knot group and among them only boundary parabolic ones will be considered in this paper .",
    "we observed that some interesting phenomena arise when pinched octahedra appear in a solution .",
    "we first suggest a notion of r - related diagrams as follows .",
    "let a solution to the gluing equations for @xmath11 have pinched octahedra .",
    "then it also satisfies the gluing equations for @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a new diagram obtained from @xmath1 by changing a crossing at which a pinched octahedron is assigned ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "we say two such diagrams @xmath1 and @xmath14 , having a  common @xmath0-solution \" , are r - related .",
    "here ` r ' stands for ` representation ' meaning that both knots @xmath2 and @xmath15 , represented by @xmath1 and @xmath14 respectively , have representations of knot groups with the same image group in @xmath16 .",
    "these representations is called partially abelian representations where meaning of `` partially abelian '' will be explained in the following section .",
    "we also show that whenever a pinched solution arises , we can replace the crossing , where the pinch occurs , by rational tangles with a relatively easy change of @xmath0-solutions ( theorem [ thm : main2 ] ) .",
    "this shows that we can construct lots of  bigger \" knots having the same representations and the complex volume as the one we started with . in the last section ,",
    "we describe how we can find examples of r - related diagrams through the connected sum .",
    "we thank hyuk kim and seonhwa kim for helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "let @xmath1 be a knot diagram of a knot @xmath2 with @xmath17 crossings .",

    "we denote the ideal octahedron of @xmath20 at a crossing @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "we divide each octahedron @xmath23 into five tetrahedra by adding two edges as in figure [ fig : octa_region ] and call the resulting ideal triangulation of @xmath6 _ the five - term triangulation _ @xmath11 . considering the octahedra @xmath24 to be hyperbolic , cho and murakami @xcite suggested region variables as a way to describe shape of the hyperbolic octahedra .",
    "a region variable @xmath25 is a non zero complex valued variable assigned to a region @xmath26 of @xmath1 where the ratio of adjacent region variables around @xmath22 becomes the shape parameter of a tetrahedron in @xmath23 as in figure  [ fig : octa_region ] .",
    "it turns out that the hyperbolic ideal octahedra @xmath24 whose shapes are determined by @xmath0-variables as above automatically satisfy the gluing equation for every edge of @xmath11 except for the edges corresponding to the regions of @xmath1 ; see section 4.3 of @xcite for details .",
    "the gluing equations for these edges are @xmath27 for each region @xmath26 of @xmath1 where the product is over all corner crossings of a region @xmath26 and @xmath28 is the cross - ratio at the side edge of @xmath23 corresponding to @xmath26 .",

    "since both the ratios of @xmath0-variables and @xmath29 s are cross - ratios at the edges of @xmath23 , from the general relation of these cross - ratios of an octahedron , one can compute @xmath30 s in terms of region variables as follows : @xmath31          \\tau_{k , b } = & \\dfrac{(w_b - w_c ) ( w_b - w_a)}{w_a w_c - w_b w_d } \\\\[13pt ]          \\tau_{k , c } = & \\dfrac { w_b w_d -w_a w_c } { ( w_c-   w_d ) ( w_c -   w_b ) } \\\\[13pt ]          \\tau_{k , d } = & \\dfrac{(w_d - w_a ) ( w_d - w_c)}{w_a w_c - w_b w_d }          \\end{array }          \\right .",
