    "collisionless shock waves in relativistic astrophysical flows have been implicated as the energizing mechanism for emission in a variety of non - thermal sources - termination shocks of pulsar winds ( @xcite ) , hot - spot shocks terminating jets from radio galaxies ( @xcite ) and internal shocks in agn and microquasar jets ( @xcite ) , internal and external shocks in grbs ( @xcite ) and outflows from other high energy transients ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while shock jump conditions applied to models of magnetohydrodynamic flow set the constraints on",
    "what fraction of flow energy goes into heat of all sorts , the partition of that energy between ions and electrons ( and positrons , when these are present ) , and the distributions of particle momenta ( thermal or non - thermal ) , are kinetic questions not addressed by the macroscopic conservation laws .",
    "the kinetic questions are those of collisionless plasma physics - two body encounters can not generate the entropy implied by the jump conditions on the observed scales of transition from non - radiative flow ( upstream , in the shock excitation model ) to the observed regions of synchrotron emission ( downstream , in the shock model ) , nor can collisional processes lead to non - thermal particle spectra",
    ".    a fundamental approach in which the flow and kinetic structure of relativistic shocks are resolved on all scales offers the opportunity to evaluate the nature of the electromagnetic turbulence generated , as a function of the upstream parameters of the flow , simultaneously with a determination of the heated ( possibly non - thermally accelerated ) particle spectra both up and downstream . for this purpose , fully kinetic particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations ( @xcite ) provide a powerful investigatory tool , since these model the plasma from first principles , with the only approximations being those that go into the method - primarily the `` cloud - in - cell '' algorithm , which in effect softens the interactions to the grid scale .",
    "pic simulations of relativistic transverse magnetosonic shocks in a symmetric pair plasma were first reported by @xcite and by @xcite , using spatially 1d models .",
    "magnetized shocks are characterized by coherent gyration ( @xcite ) and cyclotron instability ( @xcite ) of the plasma species as they encounter the shock front - magnetic reflection mediates the density and velocity transition , while the instabilty of the induced gyration mediates the entropy generation .",
    "simulations of the weibel instability when @xmath4 with applications to unmagnetized relativistic shocks have been reported recently by a number of authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "spitkovsky and arons ( in preparation ) have found comparable results , and show how the shock structures in pair plasmas depend on the magnetic field strength and orientation with respect to the flow .",
    "all these results indicate that non - thermal particle acceleration is either weak or absent in shocks in pair plasmas .",
    "@xcite found that when the upstream flow includes heavy ions which carry a significant fraction of the upstream flow energy , non - thermal acceleration _ does _ occur , as a consequence of the absorption of ion waves emitted at harmonics of the ion cyclotron frequency reabsorbed by the pairs , even though the shock structure is one dimensional and no cross field diffusion occurred .",
    "the interaction is resonant , in contrast to the non - resonant scattering underlying diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) .",
    "computational limitations required the use of a low rest mass ratio , @xmath5 .    those inhomogeneous shock calculations showed no electron acceleration . while most of the characteristics of the instability scale with just the energy density ratio between the protons and the pairs , the efficacy of the waves as accelerators of electrons and positrons also depends on the polarization properties of the proton cyclotron waves .",
    "the lack of electron acceleration at low mass ratio stems from the polarization of the waves excited . in a quasi - neutral pair plasma",
    "the waves are linearly polarized .",
    "if the heavy ions are a small fraction by number , the waves excited by the ion maser remain almost linearly polarized . since linearly",
    "polarized waves are an equal mixture of left and right circularly polarized modes , equal electron and positron acceleration might have been expected .",
    "however , the simulations also revealed that the mechanism is a significant accelerator only if the energy density in the ions @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the upstream ion density and @xmath8 is the upstream flow lorentz factor , is comparable to the upstream energy density in the pairs , @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath10 . for the small mass ratios employed ,",
    "the dispersion relations for small amplitude waves show that at comparable energy densities in the species , the waves are still strongly left handed , with consequent preference for positron acceleration .",
    "the earlier work also entirely neglected upstream thermal spread in the momenta of the species .",
    "the acceleration mechanism relies upon cyclotron absorption of waves in the pairs at high harmonics of the ion cyclotron frequency . since the shock in the pairs alone heats the pairs to a temperature @xmath11 ( if @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the upstream magnetic field strength and @xmath14 the upstream rest mass density , both measured in the downstream frame ) , efficient non - thermal acceleration of the pairs requires cyclotron absorption of ion waves at frequency @xmath15 ; that is , the relativistic cyclotron instability of the ion ring in the shock front s leading edge must generate significant power at harmonic numbers @xmath16 . when the upstream plasma is completely cold , this is not a problem - the growth rate of the instability in a homogeneous medium scales as @xmath17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we shall see that if there is thermal dispersion in the upstream ion momenta @xmath18 , growth is inhibited , with no substantial wave power at harmonic numbers above @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper we reinvestigate the one dimensional shock structure of a transverse magnetosonic shock , with particular attention to the effect of more realistic mass ratios and the incorporation of thermal dispersion in the upstream medium .    in  [ sec : shocks ] we undertake the study of the structure and acceleration properties of transverse relativistic shocks .

    "this leads to comparable heating and acceleration rates for positrons and electrons . in  [",

    "we study relativistic transverse magnetosonic shock waves .",
    "our analysis was carried out through numerical simulations performed with xoopic ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations were 1d and were performed in the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shockgeom ] below .",
    "when the simulation starts , the simulation box is permeated with a static uniform magnetic field directed along the @xmath20-axis and a uniform electric field along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "new plasma is constantly injected in the simulation box from the left boundary .",
    "the plasma moves along the @xmath22-axis with velocity @xmath23 ( four - velocity @xmath24 ) .",
    "the drift motion is initialized and maintained in the upstream medium by @xmath25 , which is set equal to @xmath26 .",
    "the right boundary of the simulation box is a conductor which behaves as a perfectly reflecting wall , both for particles and electromagnetic radiation .",
    "when the plasma first impacts on the wall , a reverse shock propagates towards the left .",
    "what we are interested in is the behaviour of the fluid at , and right after , the crossing of this reverse shock .",
    "the upstream and downstream conditions are related by the ideal mhd jump conditions for a relativistic , transverse , magnetosonic shock .",
    "these were derived by @xcite , as expressed in the shock frame , and by @xcite as expressed in the downstream frame .",
    "quantities expressed in this latter frame are more convenient for purposes of direct comparison of the results of our numerical simulations with the theoretical expectations . since the wall on the right of the simulation box is at rest , the @xmath22-component of the fluid velocity must vanish downstream of the shock .",
    "the downstream frame is therefore coincident with the computational observer s frame and it is the frame in which all quantities that will enter the following discussion are measured . in this frame , the shock moves toward the left , with velocity @xmath27 .",
    "we assume the fluid upstream to be cold , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the proper pressure and density upstream , and to move at ultrarelativistic speed , with lorentz factor @xmath31 and 4-velocity @xmath32 .",
    "for the fluid downstream , we assume the ideal ultrarelativistic equation of state to hold , with proper enthalpy @xmath33 .",

    ", we shall deal with the case of a plasma with @xmath49 .",

    "the simulation grid was made of 1024 cells , each of size @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being the particle larmor radius based on the upstream @xmath55 field and flow lorentz factor .",
    "the initial number of particles per cell was 32 for each species .",
    "the results are basically unchanged when @xmath56 is varied from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , the number of cells between 512 and 2048 , and the number of particles of each species per cell from 8 to 64 .",
    "the time - step is @xmath59 in all cases , in order to satisfy the courant condition .    as it was the case for the simulations performed by @xcite",
    ", we find in our simulation the presence of an electromagnetic precursor wave , propagating ahead of the shock , into the upstream medium , at essentially the speed of light .",
    "the results in the following figures refer to a time when the reverse shock has propagated far enough from the right wall of the simulation , so that edge effects ( spurious oscillations due to the vicinity of the conducting boundary ) do not affect the dynamics around the shock front , while the precursor has not reached the left boundary of the box yet .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairvel ] we show , on the left , the ( @xmath60 ) and ( @xmath61 ) sections of the electrons phasespace .",
    "the behavior of the positrons is completely analogous .",
    "the main thing to notice is the loop that develops at the crossing of the shock in the ( @xmath60 ) plane , especially evident in the bottom panel .",

    "[ fig : pairvel ] we also plot the different electromagnetic field components as a function of position .",
    "the longitudinal electric field always stays around zero with negligibly small oscillations .",
    "this is just what one expects due to the charge and mass symmetry , together with overall neutrality , leading to decoupling of the transverse from longitudinal extraordinary mode .",
    "the transverse component of the electric field vanishes on average behind the shock , as predicted by ideal mhd , but of course there are oscillations due to the development of cyclotron instability in the pairs . the same behavior is seen in the magnetic field . the latter , after the first two main peaks , corresponding to the turning points of the first reflection loop , oscillates around the value computed from the jump conditions ( eqs .",

    "the distribution function progressively evolves towards a maxwellian for both species .",
    "the temperature of the maxwellian is in perfect agreement with the prediction of ideal mhd ( eq .  [ eq : temp3 ] ) : @xmath64 .",
    "we show that with protons present in the upstream flow , the downstream @xmath66 exhibit non - thermal heating , a.k.a . shock acceleration .",
    "we first tackle the problem of how the particle acceleration process is affected by the waves polarization .    in the following",
    "we discuss the results of two simulations in which a plasma with @xmath67 and @xmath68 is considered .",
    "the latter condition is realized in two different ways , first adopting a mass and number ratio between ions and electrons equal to 20 and 0.4 respectively ( case a ) , and then using @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( case b ) .",

    "the box contains more than 10 ion larmor orbits and the number of particles per cell is 16 .",
    "the initial plasma lorentz factor is @xmath52 , but no dependence of the results on this parameter is expected as long as the condition @xmath31 is satisfied . as to the time - step , finally , this is taken to be @xmath73 , so that the courant condition is ensured .    in figs .",

    "this is a first signature of what we will find to be the most important difference between the two simulations .    before discussing this point , however ,",
    "let us briefly comment on the plots showing the electromagnetic field components in the two cases .",
    "first of all , in both cases , the presence of the electromagnetic precursor propagating ahead of the shock in the upstream medium is well evident .",
    "this wave is a purely transverse electromagnetic wave , as one can readily deduce from the absence of fluctuations in the longitudinal component of the electric field upstream of the shock .",
    "it is the same precursor as appears in magnetized shocks in pure pair plasmas ( see previous section and also @xcite ) , and is emitted by the quasi - coherent rings of @xmath66 reflected at the leading edge of the whole shock structure .    as to the fields downstream , now the oscillations observed in the longitudinal component of the electric field are larger than in fig .  [",
    "fig : pairvel ] : due to the fact that the charge and mass symmetry of the pure pair plasma is broken by the presence of the ions , the transverse mode is partly longitudinal .",

    "we observe , for all species , and in all cases , a progressive broadening of the distribution function with increasing distance from the shock front .",
    "however the details of the process are different between the different species and between the two simulations .    in case",
    "a , the energy release of the ions is quicker than in case b. one also sees , in the plots on the left , that a preferential heating of positrons occurs , as shown by the effective temperatures of the different species ( value of @xmath76 reported in the plots ) .",
    "moreover , positrons are not only heated but also non - thermally accelerated , since the energy excess is found in the form of a well developed high energy suprathermal tail .    in case b",
    ", one still observes hotter positrons than electrons , but the difference between the effective temperatures of the two species is smaller .",

    "the resonance condition for absorption of an ion cyclotron wave by an electron or positron requires that @xmath137 .",
    "thermal dispersion @xmath138 in the upstream ions prevents growth for harmonic number @xmath139 , which cuts the efficiency of generation of a non - thermal tail to the pairs momentum distributions .",
    "in accord with previous results ( @xcite ) , we find full thermalization in pure @xmath140 shocks .",
    "the reason is the rapid reabsorption of waves at and above the upper hybrid frequency @xmath141 , which causes the shock to behave as if it were collisional - rapid emission of the em waves by the relativistic cyclotron instability at the particle reflection front , with rapid reabsorption of the waves , and exchange of real photons , is a mechanism just as capable as the exchange of virtual photons in coulomb collisions in producing local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the conclusion , that pure pair shocks yield relativistic maxwellians in the downstream medium , is not limited to the one - dimensionality of our model , as is shown elsewhere in 3d simulations by spitkovsky and arons ( in preparation ) .",
    "those simulations show that at sufficiently low @xmath44 ( @xmath142 is low enough ) , the relativistic weibel instability ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) takes over from cyclotron instability in the pairs as the deceleration and thermalization mechanism of the shock wave , even when the background magnetic field is fully transverse to the flow .",
    "the physical reasons for this result are discussed in detail elsewhere , in the context of the 3d results and @xmath143 plasmas ( @xcite ) have had insufficient size and temporal length ( or have been constrained by periodic boundary conditions in the flow direction ) to show the development of the shock wave ; as a result , they have been , in effect , studies of the foreshock . ] . however , the essence is that the magnetic fields generated by the weibel instability in an unmagnetized shock saturate in a tangled network of tangled magnetic filaments ( @xcite ) , taking a distance @xmath144 .",
    "these filaments scatter and thermalize the incoming particles . since @xmath145",
    ", weibel based thermalization ( a multi - diemensional effect ) controls the shock structure for @xmath146 . for larger magnetizations , the cyclotron effects studied here dominate , somewhat modified by mild crinkling of the shock front .    in the shock wave",
    ", the incoming flow continuously injects cold ( @xmath147 ) ions into the pair plasma , the latter being already heated by the leading shock in the pairs alone .",
    "these freshly injected cold ions efficiently produce high harmonic waves which are cyclotron resonant with the pairs , even though the heated ions that are found further downstream from the pair shock do not efficiently radiate high harmonic waves .",
    "magnetic reflection at the shock front produces a continuous supply of cold gyrating ions , thus ensuring energy transfer from the ions to the non - thermal pairs in the downstream medium , different from what is the case in the analogous initial value problem in a uniform medium .",
    "when the ion density is a small fraction of the pair density , non - thermal acceleration becomes symmetric between electrons and positrons .",
    "it also becomes less efficient , leading to steeper power - law slopes in the non - thermal part of the spectrum .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allhist100 ] , the spectra take a maxwellian form up to energies around @xmath148 , then have a power law form at higher energies . the energy above which the power law distribution sets in , and the slope , depend on @xmath149 .",
    "thus , apparent universality ( if it exists ) of power law spectra in synchrotron sources where _ relativistic _ shocks are inferred to play a role in non - thermal accleration would be a consequence of universality in the composition of the upstream flow , expressed as the ratio @xmath150 , if the cyclotron resonance mechanism described here really is the dominant non - thermal heating process and if all relativistic shocks are sufficiently close to the transverse geometry studied here .    at present , nothing has been published on the full 3d structure of these shocks relativistic shock in 3d with a mass ratio @xmath151 . ] .",
    "our expectation is that the 3d structure of electron - positron - ion transverse shocks will show a transition to unmagnetized physics at a low value of @xmath152 .",
    "the value of this transition magnetization is quite uncertain , since current neutralization of the ion filaments formed by the weibel instability by electron return currents ( @xcite ) may greatly increase the thermalization length , thus giving more room in @xmath44 space for cyclotron dynamics to ultimately mediate the shock structure .",
    "these issues are under investigation .",
    "relativistic flows that get their energization from poynting losses from compact objects ( possibly all in our list of pulsar winds , microquasar , agn and grb jets ) may well be in this category , since the pair and ion content may both be set by the underlying electrodynamics of the compact objects ( rotating neutron star , magnetized disk . ) quantification of how close shocks have to be to transverse requires consideration of a wider range of shock geometries .",
    "investigation of other non - thermal heating mechanisms , such as diffusive shock acceleration and magnetic pumping , require higher dimensional simulations .",
    "spitkovsky and arons ( in preparation ) address both of these issues .    in the shocks , the relative proportion of electron versus positron acceleration follows the ion to pair density , as expected from the changes in wave polarization inferred from the linear theory .    our study of the shock acceleration process confirms , therefore , the results found by @xcite , extending them to a higher mass ratio . also confirmed is the expectation that signs of electron acceleration would be found if one could consider a plasma that contained the same amount of upstream flow energy given to a smaller fraction of ions",
    ". the overall evolution of the particles is consistent with resonant cyclotron absorption of magnetosonic waves by the pairs , whose frequencies are harmonics of the ion cyclotron frequency , being the main process providing non - thermal acceleration .",
    "magnetic reflection of the upstream ions in the shock front sets up the unstable ion cyclotron motion which causes the wave emission .",
    "the non - thermal acceleration efficiencies and power law indices of the particle spectra are shown , as a function of the basic governing parameter @xmath95 , in table [ tab : epp100 ] , when the upstream flow is cold .",
    "the reduction of the acceleration efficiency for a single value of the mach number @xmath153 , with results summarized in table [ tab : epp100 t ] , shows the strong effect of large upstream momentum dispersion in the upstream flow .",
    "equivalently , the absorption of ion cyclotron waves in the shock structure by the pairs is a strong non - thermal acceleration mechanism when the upstream flow is quite cold ( @xmath154 ) , as results from adiabatic expansion in relativistic outflows from compact objects .",
    "we conclude by pointing out an interesting feature of this acceleration mechanism .",
    "the acceleration efficiency and the spectral form of the accelerated particles depend on the composition of the flow upstream of the shock . that composition depends on the source of the relativistic flow within which the shock wave occurs .",
    "relativistic flows of the type considered here are thought to be the consequence of magnetized wind and jet acceleration by compact objects , and pair creation within and near such objects .",
    "these properties are the result of the compact objects electrodynamics , which constrains some aspects of the outflowing plasma composition to particular values - for example , in pulsars and magnetars , the ion flux is constrained to be the goldreich - julian value .",
    "thus , one might expect a correlation between the radiative emission properties of the shocked flow and the emission properties of the underlying compact object , as appears to be the case in the x - ray emission from pulsar wind nebulae and the spectra of the pulsed x - ray emission from the pulsars driving those nebulae ( @xcite ) .",

    "we accomplished part of the work while we enjoyed the hospitality of the kavli institute for theoretical physics in april 2005 .",
    "we consider an overall neutral @xmath155  plasma uniformly distributed in space and permeated by a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the initial distribution of the plasma in momentum space is described as rings , with all species gyrating in the background magnetic field with the same lorentz factor , @xmath156 . for most of the work in this section",
    ", we assume that all the species are cold , that is , have no dispersion around their gyration momenta . in preparation for the shock studies described in  [ sec : shocks ] , we also briefly describe some results of the linear instability theory when the ions gyrate with a small momentum dispersion in a relativistically hot pair plasma .",
    "cold ring distributions are known to be unstable to cyclotron emission and the growth - rate of the instability scales proportionally to the particles cyclotron frequency .",
    "hence , in the situation we are presently considering the process of relaxation of the particles distribution functions will show two different stages .",
    "initially , the pairs , whose gyration frequencies are much larger than those of the ions , will undergo cyclotron instability and tend to thermalize through emission and absorption of relativistic cyclotron waves . during this stage ,",
    "the ions form a static uniform neutralizing background : they can not interact efficiently with the waves produced by the pairs , which are too high frequency , and therefore their distribution is expected to be left nearly unchanged while the pairs relax . only at later times the ions",
    "will develop the same instability , with the delay determined by the difference in the larmor frequencies of the lighter and heavier particles .    in the case of a plasma with",
    "about equal amount of energy carried by light particles and magnetic fields ( @xmath157 ) , the time - scale for the cyclotron instability in the pairs to reach saturation turns out to be of order a few tens of gyration periods , while it is shorter for lower magnetization ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , if one considers , as we shall do in the following , a plasma with magnetization @xmath158 , for high enough mass ratios , the expectation is that the instability of the pairs will have reached saturation , and they will have already almost completely thermalized , before the ion cyclotron instability sets in .",
    "the ion distribution function is described by : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the particle four - velocity ( @xmath161 , with @xmath162 being the particle lorentz factor ) , @xmath163 is the initial value of @xmath160 and the symbols @xmath164 and @xmath165 are with respect to the magnetic field direction .",
    "we assume the magnetic field aligned with the z - axis of a cartesian system of coordinates @xmath166 .",
    "since we are interested in the particles cyclotron emission the waves we are going to consider will have both the electric field and wave vector perpendicular to the magnetic field direction ( extraordinary mode ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath167 the dispersion relation can be written as : @xmath168    the general expression for the dielectric tensor in a uniform magnetized plasma can be found , for example , following the theory in the book by ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we mentioned above that when the ion instability is still in its early phases , the pairs will have already exhausted their free energy .",
    "this fact leads us to expect the fluid approximation to appropriately describe the pairs contribution to the propagation characteristics of the waves whose growth is stimulated by the ions .",
    "we will therefore describe the pairs response as that of a relativistically hot fluid with effective temperature @xmath169 ( @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the pressure and @xmath172 the number density ) and adiabatic index @xmath34 .",
    "the latter would be @xmath173 for a 3d relativistic plasma and @xmath63 for a 2d relativistic plasma : we confine our attention to the 2d case , since our spatially 1d simulations do not heat the plasma in the magnetic field direction .",
    "@xmath178 @xmath179 where we have used the following definitions : @xmath180 with @xmath181 the plasma and cyclotron frequencies of particles of species @xmath182 respectively . the functions @xmath183 that appear in the eqs .",
    "[ eq : etotxx]-[eq : etotyy ] are the ordinary bessel functions of the first kind of index @xmath184 and argument @xmath185 .    moreover , here , @xmath186 is equal to the initial lorentz factor of the plasma @xmath187 , whereas @xmath188 , entering the quantities that refer to the pairs , is defined by the temperature of the pairs after the saturation of their instability : @xmath189 .",
    "the relation @xmath190 is going to hold , since , even if the fraction of energy the pairs lost to waves during the instability were negligible , the pressure of a dirac @xmath132 distribution function centered on @xmath191 corresponds to that of a maxwellian with @xmath192 .",
    "in general , solutions of the dispersion relation are found numerically and in fig .",
    "[ fig : disprel ] we plot the results in a few cases relevant for the present study . in all plots",
    "we consider a plasma with @xmath193 and with a baryon fraction @xmath194 .",
    "the two upper panels refer to the case when the ions can be treated as completely cold ( analogous to @xcite ) . in the upper left panel",
    "the pair plasma is approximated as neutral and the coupling between the longitudinal and transverse components of the extraordinary mode is neglected @xmath195 . in the upper right panel roots of the complete dispersion equation are shown .",
    "when the coupling is neglected , at high harmonic numbers , the dispersion relation shows two separate unstable branches , corresponding to electromagnetic ( @xmath196 ) and magnetosonic waves ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "the growth - rate of magnetosonic waves is more or less constant with increasing @xmath184 while the growth of electromagnetic waves is soon depressed at high harmonics .",
    "the main effect of the coupling is to further depress the growth of electromagnetic waves , whereas the growth - rate of magnetosonic waves stays about the same .    in the lower panels of fig.[fig : disprel ] ,",
    "we show the solution of the dispersion equation in cases when the ion component is not treated as perfectly cold at the onset of the instability .",
    "the plasma composition is the same as above but now a thermal spread of the ion distribution is included , with the distribution function in eq.[eq : ring ] replaced by : @xmath198 \\over \\sqrt{\\pi}\\ \\delta u\\ u_0}\\ .",

    "we assume @xmath201 in the left panel , while the case @xmath202 is on the right .",
