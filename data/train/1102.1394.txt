    "it turns out that their autocorrelation functions can be written as a function of the scaling variable @xmath188 , where @xmath1 is the mode number and @xmath2 the length of the chain , and a function @xmath3 which is shared by all modes .",
    "this latter function causes exponential decay at short times @xmath22 and long times @xmath189 , and causes an intermediate regime of stretched exponential decay .",
    "although the notion of structural modes stems from a freely moving polymer , held together by harmonic forces , it also turns out to be useful for the dynamics in the repton model , for which the chain is restricted to move along its contour .",
    "the reasons are , apart from the above mentioned scaling properties , the following .    1 .",
    "the structural modes form a complete basis for the structural quantities , i.e. any linear function of the link variables can be written as a superposition of structural modes . 2 .",
    "the equal - time correlations between the structural modes are strictly orthogonal and they preserve this orthogonality to a high degree for correlations at different times .",
    "so for practical purposes cross - correlations between structural modes may be ignored .",
    "3 .   this orthogonality allows to write the correlations in time between structural quantities as a sum over the autocorrelation functions of the structural modes .",
    "the motion of the center - of - mass is correlated with that of the middle monomer .",
    "this stems from the fact that a reptating polymer experiences more than only internal forces  part of the forces a reptating polymer experiences originate from the dynamical constraints that prevent the polymer from moving sideways .",
    "the effect of this correlation is captured in the phenomenon that mode @xmath58 is _ not _ independent from the other non - zero modes .",
    "the mean - squared displacement of the center - of - mass shows also changes in its behavior at the same crossover times @xmath80 and @xmath190 : from an initially diffusive regime in which it grows as @xmath191 similar to a free rouse chain , via an intermediate regime with anomalous diffusion in which it grows as @xmath192 , to an asymptotic regime with reentrant diffusive behavior where it grows as @xmath193 .",
    "the asymptotic regime of the mean - squared displacement of the middle repton equals that of the center - of - mass , as it should to preserve integrity of the chain , but this regime is only entered after the tube renewal time @xmath194 .",
    "it has an initially diffusive regime in which it grows linearly with time , also similar to the free rouse chain .",
    "in contrast to the center - of - mass , it shows however two intermediate regimes in which it grows as @xmath156 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "we have presented arguments that for general reptation motion of a polymer , a real - space mean - squared displacement of the middle repton scaling as @xmath195 for some @xmath186 must be accompanied by a mean - squared displacement of the center of mass increasing in time as @xmath187 .",
    "finally we note that the most interesting and revealing aspect of the mode analysis presented in this paper is the interplay between the translational degree of freedom and the the structural degrees of freedom , i.e. , the cross - correlation between the position of the middle repton and the vector connecting the center - of - mass and the middle repton ."
