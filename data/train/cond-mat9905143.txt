    "the glass transition temperature @xmath2 for liquids is defined experimentally as the onset of calorimetric anomalies @xcite .",
    "it is usually understood that @xmath2 is not related to a thermodynamic transition @xcite , but to the slowing down of one or more degrees of freedom .",
    "this slowing down prevents the system to reach the equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this question is of interest because almost all liquids can form glasses if cooled at high enough rate .",
    "moreover , many other materials as for example polymers , microemulsions , granular material , vortex glasses , ionic conductors , colloids , plastic glassy crystals and spin glasses ( sgs ) @xcite show glassy properties .    even well above @xmath2 ,",
    "where glassy systems actually can equilibrate , they show experimentally dynamic anomalies as precursor phenomena of the glass transition @xcite . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "one of the open questions is if these precursor phenomena are related to the thermodynamics of the system @xcite , or if they are not , like the glass transition occurring at lower temperature @xmath2 . in particular , for the ising sg @xcite such a relation between precursor phenomena and a thermodynamic free energy _ essential _",
    "singularity has been shown @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this model there is a dynamic anomaly at a temperature @xmath3 . above @xmath3",
    "the relaxation processes have an exponential behavior , while below @xmath3 they have a non - exponential behavior .",
    "theoretical and numerical evidences show that @xmath3 coincides with the griffiths temperature @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath4 is the transition temperature that the model would have if the frustration due to disorder is removed .",
    "a way to remove the frustration is , for example , to substitute every antiferromagnetic interaction with a ferromagnetic interaction . in general , removing the frustration , the model will have ferromagnetic regions and antiferromagnetic regions and @xmath4 will be the transition temperature of the unfrustrated model . to be more precise , the free energy of the ising sg in external field has a singularity which disappears in the limit of zero external field and which occurs at a temperature that goes to @xmath4 in the same limit .",
    "this singularity is present only in disordered systems .",
    "the relation @xmath5 has also been shown to be valid numerically in 2 dimensions ( 2d ) for a model with potts variables that generalizes the ising sg @xcite .",
    "this generalized model will be considered in the following and we will refer to it as the potts sg .    until now we talked about glass dynamics in systems with disorder , but numerical simulations show that it is possible to observe glassy behavior with precursor phenomena for spin systems _ without _ disorder but _ with _ frustration @xcite .",
    "these systems , due to the lack of disorder , are more suitable for a theoretical approach @xcite",
    ". in particular , one can try to answer the question about the relation between the precursor phenomena and the thermodynamics of the system .    in ref.@xcite",
    "it was considered a simple case : the fully frustrated ( ff ) ising model @xcite where ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions are ordered in such a way that any lattice cell has an odd number of antiferromagnetic interactions ( i.e. is frustrated ) .",
    "it is shown ( by simulations in 2d and 3d ) that the onset @xmath3 of non - exponential relaxation processes is related to a random - bond percolation transition @xcite .",
    "as for the ising sg , it is possible to generalize the ff ising model to a ff model with potts variables @xcite : the potts ff model that will be described in details in the following . in ref.@xcite the dynamics of the potts ff model",
    "was compared with the dynamics of the potts sg model and some anticipations on the relation between precursor phenomena and thermodynamics were given . in this work we study in details the thermodynamics of the potts ff model , showing that @xmath3 corresponds to the thermodynamic transition temperature @xmath6 of the potts variables .",
    "it is important to note that in any ff model the griffiths temperature @xmath4 can not be defined for the lack of disorder . therefore @xmath4 can not play any role in these cases .",
    "the comparison of the results presented here with the analogous study of the potts sg model with disorder @xcite allows to give insight on the role of disorder . to this goal",
    "we introduce a formal parameter @xmath7 that connects both models .",

    "for @xmath11 we have the potts ff model ( without disorder ) .    from ref.@xcite and from the present work , it is possible to show that for @xmath10 and @xmath11 there are two thermodynamics transitions .",

    "it is important to note that , while the potts variables have a transition at @xmath6 , the ising spins have no transition at @xmath6 and , in principle , no dynamical anomalies are expected for them .    on the other hand , the data for @xmath176 show that the long - time behavior is well described by an exponential function . in particular , the form @xmath185 with @xmath190 and a non - zero @xmath122 fits very well also the data for the lowest temperature considered here . note that , in principle , one can expect a dynamical anomaly even for the energy density @xmath91 , since it depends explicitly on the critical potts variables .    in the fitting forms used",
    ", the correlation time @xmath188 is defined as a fitting parameter .",
    "another possible definition is the following ( integral correlation time ) : @xmath193 due to the divergence of the correlation time , the definition in eq.([int ] ) does not converge near the transition temperature .",
    "therefore it is not shown in figs .",
    "[ corr_e ] and [ par_m ] for the temperature with the largest @xmath188",
    ". however , where it converges , all the different estimates of the correlation time are numerically consistent as show in fig.[corr_e ] and [ par_m ] .",
    "note that , even if the data are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit , finite size effects are still present .",
    "indeed , the critical temperature estimated from @xmath188 measurements , within our temperature mesh , is between @xmath194 and @xmath195 , that is at variance with the estimate of @xmath6 .",
    "we have studied a schematic model for glasses where frustrated orientational degrees of freedom , associated to @xmath21-states potts variables @xmath22 , induce complex dynamics . in real systems",
    "the frustration can be associated , for example , to steric hindrance of non spherical molecules in structural glasses .",
    "each @xmath22 has an absolute value ( @xmath196 ) and a sign ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "the frustration is over the signs and can be _ with _ disorder or _ without _ disorder , depending on a model parameter @xmath51 .",
    "for @xmath9 there is disorder , while for @xmath11 the model is ( fully ) frustrated without disorder .",
    "for @xmath8 there is no frustration , and the model recovers the @xmath21-states ferromagnetic potts model .    for @xmath198 the model has two thermodynamic transitions .",
    "the high - temperature transition at @xmath148 for the model with @xmath21 states is in the universality class of the @xmath12-states ferromagnetic potts model .",
    "therefore the fluctuations ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) of the orientational degrees of freedom diverge at @xmath148 ( for @xmath149 ) , as well as the correlation times of quantities depending on them ( like the potts order parameter @xmath138 or the energy density @xmath91 ) . for them",
    "we estimated the dynamic critical exponents @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "the low - temperature transition is a spin glass transition for @xmath10 , or a fully frustrated transition for @xmath11 , and marks the ordering transition of the signs @xmath24 ( ising variables ) .",
    "the diverging fluctuations at upper and lower transition temperatures are expected to be experimentally observable only using specific probes that couple with them .",
    "examples of such probes could be those associated to dielectric measurements in supercooled - liquids and plastic glassy crystals or to electron spin resonance spectroscopy measurements @xcite .    for @xmath11 and @xmath49 the model shows a complex dynamics in correspondence of @xmath6",
    ". in particular , the correlation function for @xmath138 and the correlation function for the signs @xmath24 change their behaviors .",
    "they have an exponential behavior above @xmath6 and a non - exponential behavior below @xmath6 .",
    "this behavior is expected at least for any @xmath149 , because it is associated to the free energy singularity occurring at the second - order transition of the potts variables .",
    "therefore the complex dynamics corresponds to a _ real _ thermodynamic transition .    for @xmath10 and @xmath49 the onset of this dynamic anomaly",
    "is shifted to a higher temperature , _ above _ @xmath6 .",
    "it occurs in correspondence of the griffiths essential singularity of the free energy .",
    "this singularity is not defined in the @xmath11 case .",
    "for zero external field it goes to the transition temperature of the ferromagnetic @xmath21-states potts model @xmath85 and it vanishes .",
    "therefore the onset of complex behavior does not correspond to a _",
    "real _ thermodynamic transition .",
    "we have shown that the potts transition at @xmath148 for any @xmath12 and @xmath51 considered here , coincides with a percolation transition .",
    "it is not worthless to note that the dynamic transition at @xmath153 persists also for @xmath31 and @xmath73 @xcite . in these cases @xmath153 does not correspond to a thermodynamic transition , but only to a percolation transition .",
    "therefore for @xmath201 the dynamic anomaly is no more related to a thermodynamic transition , but to a percolation transition in the real space @xcite .",
    "this result could be in some relation with experimental results on microemulsions @xcite .",
    "finally , we have shown that it is possible to generalize the exact relation for the ferromagnetic potts transition temperature @xmath28 in 2d to a transition temperature @xmath148 for any @xmath202 , using a fitting parameter @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , @xmath81 acts like a renomarlization factor for the number of states of the model and it is @xmath203 ( ferromagnetic case ) and @xmath81 decreasing regularly with increasing @xmath51 .",
