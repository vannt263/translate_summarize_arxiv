    "subjective well - being and life satisfaction have received a significant amount of attention in the economics @xcite and psychology @xcite literature over the past decades .",
    "while cardinality properties are conceptually rejected , the ordinal nature of the information conveyed in such indicators has gradually entered public policy circles .",
    "@xcite argued that meaningful and reliable data on well - being can be collected and should be included in surveys and official statistics with further reports advocating its role in policy making in informing policy designs , monitoring progress and evaluating implementation of public interventions @xcite .",
    "however , despite suggestions by various authors @xcite , there is little consensus in how exactly such concepts are defined and what precisely they capture . for the past few years",
    "the office for national statistics in the uk monitors year - on - year improvements in reported well - being through questions on life satisfaction , feelings of self - worth , happiness and anxiety , which however provides little theoretical basis or conceptual background for such choices @xcite .",
    "while it is clear that well - being is less of an answer to a single question and more of a composite multidimensional concept , limited empirical work has pursued such considerations .",
    "the vast majority of empirical work ( for reviews see @xcite ) focuses on univariate models that would not allow taking into account dependence between constituent components and their link with overall happiness , while also being unable to correctly identify direct effects of independent determinants / variables on domain and generic happiness in the presence of such outcomes dependence .",
    "indeed conceptual work suggests bottom - up theories @xcite for life - satisfaction where judgements are based on assessments of satisfaction with a number of defined life domains with ensuing causal pathways running from the domains upwards @xcite .",
    "complementary positions view overall life satisfaction as the net outcome of reported satisfaction with life domains with the domains themselves seen as functions of objective outcomes / situations / covariates @xcite .",
    "looking at the structure of composite well - being , @xcite conclude it is more easily interpreted in terms of generic dimensions of life ( e.g. family life , social life , love life , occupational life and leisure ) than attributed to the fulfilment of personal values ( self - acceptance , autonomy , environmental mastery , purpose in life , and personal growth ) .",
    "@xcite argued for a mixture of processes where individual characteristics and traits are driving domain satisfaction ( i.e. top - down ) , which in turn drives life satisfaction ( i.e. bottom - up ) .",
    "in other words , high individual income leads to increased life satisfaction because financial satisfaction is an important component of satisfaction with life as a whole .",
    "looking at the economics of well - being literature , univariate models again dominate , while at the same time very few studies have focused on its composite structure .",
    "@xcite formulate a model very close to the initial bottom - up theories , which however is estimable only under strong assumptions of no direct association between individual covariates and generic life satisfaction .",
    "further , while forms of endogeneity are controlled for through instrumental variables , omitted variable problems and lack of sufficient exclusion restrictions to ensure robustness suggest caution in drawing conclusions .",
    "similar problems are also faced in @xcite , where again strong assumptions ( both conceptual and econometric ) are required in the model .    in this paper",
    "we propose a multivariate framework and estimate a comprehensive relationships pattern between generic and domain satisfactions with dependence explicitly modelled through copulas .",
    "modelling of dependence further allows revisiting a number of established relationships in the literature between covariates and well - being and examining their robustness in a multivariate setting ( e.g. does the importance of income on generic well - being remain when considered along income satisfaction ? ) . in short ,",
    "we establish exogenous determinants for both generic and domain satisfaction equations and separately identify structural relations among components of well - being and shed light not only into their links with generic well - being but also among themselves .",
    "this allows separate identification of the direct effect of domain characteristics and of composite domains on generic satisfaction , as well as estimation of the dependence between and among generic and domain satisfaction .",
    "we develop a novel joint copula - based markov model , where a set of bivariate copulas and a multivariate t ( mvt ) copula jointly model multivariate ordinal time - series responses with covariates .",
    "each ordinal time series is considered a copula - based markov model , where a parametric bivariate copula family is used for the joint distribution of subsequent observations and which is then related to these ordinal time - series responses using an mvt to join their conditional ( on the past ) distributions at each time point .",
    "note in passing that other continuous - variable models using copulas in several markov chains exist in the literature , * * ? ? ?",
    "* * but in our knowledge we are the first constructing such copula - based models for ordinal time - series with covariates .",
    "the theoretical and estimation concepts in the discrete case are quite different .",
    "simple parametric families of copulas in more than two dimensions typically provide limited dependence @xcite and it is generally hard to provide a better fit than the multivariate normal ( mvn ) copula , which inherits the useful properties of the mvn distribution .",
    "mvt copulas nest mvn copulas and share with them the ability to accommodate any feasible pattern of association in a set of random variables .",
    "however , the mvt copulas offer greater flexibility than mvn copulas , since they can also lead to more dependence in both joint tails , which is the case in ` mixtures ' of population ( e.g. , different locations or genders ) .",
    "implementation of the mvt copula for discrete data is feasible , but not easy , because the mvt distribution , as a latent model for discrete response , requires rectangle probabilities based on high - dimensional integrations .",
    "the probability mass function ( pmf ) can be obtained by computing an mvt rectangle probability and the randomized quasi monte carlo methods proposed by can be used for that purpose .",
    "computing the rectangle mvt probabilities via simulation based on the methods in is akin to using a simulated likelihood method , whose asymptotic efficiency , for the special case of mvn copula , has been studied by @xcite and was shown to be as good as maximum likelihood for dimension 10 or lower .    the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows .",

    "such latent correlations capture the residual dependence ( i.e. over and above the effect of covariates ) among equations / outcomes .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic ] gives a schematic of our structural model .",
    "such specification allows for direct , indirect and ripple ( spill - over ) effects on well - being , e.g. capturing at least three possible ways high individual income could affect generic satisfaction : a ) a direct effect of income , b ) an indirect effect through income satisfaction and c ) an indirect effect through increased income satisfaction that itself is the result of an improved , for example , leisure satisfaction that was caused by the initial increase in income .",
    "for estimation purposes we propose a maximum simulated likelihood method , which is based on evaluating the multidimensional integrals of the likelihood with randomized quasi monte carlo methods ; an analysis of asymptotic properties of the estimators is shown in the appendix .",

    "error reduction of monte carlo methods is achieved with variance reduction methods such as ( a ) transforming to a bounded integrand , ( b ) using antithetic variates , and ( c ) using a randomized quasi monte carlo method .",
    "the estimated parameters can be obtained by maximizing the simulated log - likelihood in ( [ jointserlik ] ) over the model parameters @xmath97 .",
    "the method was initially proposed for the analysis of discrete ( binary and count ) longitudinal data by @xcite and extended to a high - dimensional context in @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested reader to these papers for more details including studies of small - sample and asymptotic efficiency for bernoulli , poisson , and negative binomial regression models .",
    "in addition to that we study here the asymptotic properties of the maximum simulated likelihood estimators for ordinal regression models in an appendix .",
    "the simulated maximum likelihood estimates can be derived using a two - step procedure :    1 .   for each @xmath35 : 1 .   at the first inner - step the @xmath98 in ( [ indlik ] )",

    "is maximized over @xmath86 with all the other parameters fixed as estimated at the preceding steps .    in the steps above the inference function of margins method @xcite",
    "is used , which can efficiently ( in the sense of computing time and asymptotic variance ) estimate the model parameters .",
    "each of the estimated parameters can be obtained by using a quasi - newton @xcite method applied to the log - likelihood .",
    "this numerical method requires only the objective function , i.e. , the joint log - likelihood , while the gradients are computed numerically and the hessian matrix of the second order derivatives is updated in each iteration .",
    "note in passing that since the estimation of parameters in mvt copula - based models is obtained using a quasi - newton routine @xcite applied to the log - likelihood in ( [ jointserlik ] ) .",
    "the use of randomized quasi monte carlo simulation to four decimal place accuracy for evaluations of integrals works poorly , because numerical derivatives of the log - likelihood with respect to the parameters are not smooth . in order to achieve smoothness , the same set of uniform random variables",
    "should be used for every rectangle probability that comes up in the optimization of the simulated likelihood @xcite .",
    "for the estimation of the model in figure [ fig : schematic ] we use data from the british household panel survey ( bhps ) .",
    "the bhps was an annual longitudinal survey ( now superseded by understanding society ) carried out by the institute for social and economic research sampling about 10,000 individuals aged 16 years or over from 1991 to 2008 .",
    "however , the survey modules required for our model are collected on a bi - annual basis starting in wave 6 ( i.e. 1996 ) and finishing in wave 18 ( i.e. 2008 ) , resulting in a maximum of 7 measurements per individual . to ease coding , we use individuals observed at all seven time points resulting in a sample size of 4186 individuals , though our methodology does not depend on a constant  cluster \" size @xmath103 .",
    "the actual model estimated is based on one generic @xmath104 and six domain satisfaction @xmath105 questions each answered on a 1 ( not satisfied at all ) to 6 ( completely satisfied ) likert scale .",
    "the seven equations ( outcomes ) are :    @xmath104 : : :    satisfaction with life overall @xmath106 : : :    satisfaction with health @xmath107 : : :    satisfaction with income @xmath108 : : :    satisfaction with house / flat @xmath109 : : :    satisfaction with spouse / partner @xmath110 : : :    satisfaction with job @xmath111 : : :    satisfaction with leisure    each of @xmath105 is conditioned upon individual characteristics ( i.e. age , age square , gender , household size , number of kids , education and geographical region within the uk ) that are common controls in the well - being literature and domain specific factors that appear only on the respective domain equation .",
    "such exclusion restrictions capture domain specific variation while strengthening identifiability of effects .",
    "for example , health problems are used for the satisfaction with health equation , income variables in the satisfaction with income equation and so on for the rest of the equations .",
    "table [ tab : desstat ] offers definitions and breakdowns for domain specific variables , as well as the reference levels for all categorical variables .",
    "note that the original _ region _ variable is a geographical identifier that splits uk into 19 areas and which is aggregated into 5 `` super''-regions for the regressions .",
    "further , income rank is capturing relative income and is determined by the rank of the individual in their original region ( i.e. one of 19 areas ) according to their annual total income .    for equation",
    "@xmath104 we use as covariates all common and domain specific variables capturing the direct effects that each characteristics have on overall life satisfaction .",
    "this formulation allows separately identifying the direct effect of objective domain characteristics and the effect of composite domains on generic satisfaction , while , as the econometric model poses , residual dependence between and among @xmath104 and @xmath105 is captured by estimable latent correlation parameters .    given the multivariate nature of our model we restrict the estimation sample to those for whom information on each equation is available , i.e. married , employed individuals ( up to 70 years old ) who indicate to have a partner .",
    "further , as discussed earlier , albeit not a requirement of the model , we only keep those individuals that appear in all seven waves of the data .",
    "descriptive statistics for all the equation outcomes , and covariates are available in table [ tab : desstat ] where informal sample selection comparisons can also be drawn between the estimation and full sample .",
    "we fit the joint copula - based markov model with bvn , gumbel , s.gumbel , and bvt bivariate linking copulas . for bvt , choices of @xmath13 were @xmath112 . to make it easier to compare the dependence parameters , we convert the estimated parameters to kendall s @xmath71 s in @xmath113 via the relations @xmath114 , @xmath115,$ ] and @xmath116 for elliptical , frank and gumbel copulas in @xcite , @xcite , and , respectively . note that kendall s tau only accounts for the dependence dominated by the middle of the data , and it is expected to be similar amongst different families of copulas . however , the tail dependence varies , as explained in section [ sec - families ] , and is a property to consider when choosing amongst different families of copulas . for the model with bvt",

    "that is , based on data descriptions , we could expect a priori that a model with @xmath90 being the bvt copulas might be plausible , as data have more probability in the joint tails .",

    ".[tab : lfsato ] estimated parameters and joint log - likelihoods @xmath121 for the copula - based markov models for ordinal time series with covariates for satisfaction with life overall @xmath104 , where a parametric copula family @xmath90 is used for the joint distribution of subsequent observations .",
    "for the best fit , the standard errors ( se ) of the estimates , wald tests ( @xmath122 ) and @xmath22-values are also presented . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     subscript 1 denotes satisfaction with life overall ; 2 satisfaction with health ; 3 satisfaction with income ; 4 satisfaction with house / flat ; 5 satisfaction with spouse / partner ; 6 satisfaction with job ; 7 satisfaction with use of leisure time .",
    "the best fit is based on an mvt copula with 10 degrees of freedom . in this example",
    ", it is highlighted that a factor model with an mvt copula is plausible for a population that is a mixture of subpopulations , while a mvn model might be adequate for smaller homogeneous subgroups .",
    "overall , all latent correlations are positive and highly statistically significant providing evidence for the multivariate nature of well - being , while suggesting that increases in life satisfaction in one domain result in further increase in satisfaction in another and the presence of potential multiplying ripple effects .",
    "the strongest latent correlations are realised between generic and various domain responses with satisfaction with spouse , leisure , health and job domain satisfaction appearing to have the strongest links to overall well - being , followed by house and lastly income domain satisfaction . moving on ,",
    "cross - domain associations are slightly mitigated but still various pairs emerge as important . between domain satisfactions of income - house , health - income and health - leisure exhibit the strongest links , followed by spouse - leisure , income - job and house - leisure .",
    "in this paper , we develop a comprehensive conceptual model of life satisfaction and its constituents where a number of direct and indirect links between objective covariates and domain and generic components of well - being are captured .",
    "modelling dependence allows revisiting previously estimated relationships in univariate frameworks and testing their robustness in a structural setting . in order to apply such structural framework , a joint copula - based markov econometric model for ordinal time series with covariates",
    "is developed , where each ordinal time series is considered a copula - based markov model with a parametric bivariate copula for the joint distribution of subsequent observations and whose conditionals are subsequently joined through an mvt copula .",
    "we have implemented a simulated likelihood method , where the rectangles are converted to bounded integrands via the error reduction methods in , and hence the statistical efficiency of simulated likelihood is as good as maximum likelihood .",
    "results on generic well - being partially confirm findings of the literature with a u - shaped effect for age @xcite , strong health effects @xcite and significant influence of job aspects @xcite albeit comparisons with the past literature are not always straightforward due to lack of exactly overlapping variables .",
    "however , we fail to confirm hypotheses and past evidence for the importance of individual characteristics such as gender @xcite and education @xcite .",
    "further , moving from past univariate analyses @xcite to our multivariate framework where a satisfaction with income that is now explicit modelled as a separate equation , both absolute and relative income indicators fail to achieve significance implying that ignoring dependence could potentially affect findings for important variables .",
    "similar , limited significance in our structural setting has also been attributed to dimensions ( such as exercise , social life and leisure activities ) that past work found well - being improving @xcite .",
    "comparisons to the literature of well - being structure and domains satisfaction suggest comparable findings @xcite with aspect of family life , social life , love life , occupational life and leisure coming up as important @xcite , while the significance of both direct and indirect effects confirm the validity of conceptual framework and the presence of mixture patterns in the well - being structure @xcite .",
    "in fact the effects of the covariates seem to suggest a complementary story to that of the latent correlations , where the former provide some type of necessary conditions for happiness that can only be realized when the latter hold . in other words , having objectively good health and stable and profitable jobs improve chances of satisfaction with life overall or maybe set the foundations for a happy life @xcite , which however can only be enjoyed through certain personal and environmental conditions .",
    "in fact , these latter conditions that emerge from the latent correlation patterns can be usefully stylized into common clichs , such as happiness in personal life ( i.e. spousal relations ) is the key to true happiness @xcite , or that life is all about having fun ( i.e. enjoy leisure time ) , or that enjoying you work is important in enjoying life ( i.e. job satisfaction ) or finally that income does not buy happiness , i.e. , limited effect of financial satisfaction @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "theories of generic and domain satisfaction suggest new insights can be obtained through dependence modelling with copulas offering a powerful and flexible tool to accommodate all necessary relationships and dependencies .",
    "future research should aim to replicate current findings and examine their causal pathways .",
    "assume a multivariate ordinal regression in which @xmath74 dependent ordinal random variables @xmath123 are observed together with a vector @xmath76 of explanatory variables .",

    "the amount of discreteness ( number of ordinal categories ) , and latent correlation for exchangeable structures , we demonstrate patterns in the asymptotic bias of the msle , and assess the performance of the simulated likelihood .",
    "when computing the probability limits we take a constant dimension @xmath2 that increases and use discrete covariates where finite number of distinct values are assumed .",
