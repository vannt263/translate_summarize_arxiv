    "quantum computation has emerged in the past decades as a potentially powerful tool to solve problems more efficiently than its classical counterpart .",
    "one simple example is determining whether a coin is fair ( heads on one side , tails on the other ) or fake ( heads or tails on both sides ) .",
    "this is one version of _ the deutsch problem _ @xcite , who himself showed that , when exploring quantum state superposition , only one examination step is necessary , while classically the solution requires individual examination of both sides .",
    "although the algorithm originally proposed by deutsch involves manipulation of two - qubit states , there is also a `` minimal '' version of it , in the sense that just one qubit is manipulated @xcite . in this sense , minimal deutsch algorithm can be considered the most basic and simple quantum computation .",

    "in particular , the original deutsch algorithm and its generalization , the deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xcite , were implemented using photons @xcite , and its minimal version was also implemented on quantum dots @xcite .",
    "spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite is a natural source of correlated photon pairs , with the additional advantage of having many degrees of freedom that can be considered quantum systems , such as polarization @xcite , transversal @xcite , longitudinal @xcite , and orbital angular @xcite momenta . on the other hand , a spatial light modulator ( slm )",
    "can be used to perform state control @xcite .",

    "we use a double slit to encode logical qubits ( in the sense of the @xmath0 logical base of a qubit space ) in the transversal spatial modes of photons generated in a spdc process @xcite .",
    "a slm is employed as a fundamental part of our experimental setup .",
    "it has the function of simulating the `` fair coin '' or the `` fake coin '' in the optical setup . before really applying the quantum algorithm",
    ", we need a calibration process , which can also be understood as a proof of principle of the algorithm , since one uses many caries of the oracle .",

    "the slm after the double slit , together with the @xmath24 plate and the polarizer @xmath37 , works as the quantum oracle .",
    "the map of the oracle function is constant ( @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) if the phases added by the slm are equal , or balanced ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) if the phase difference is @xmath42 .",
    "once the pump beam is focused at the double slit plane , a bell state @xmath43 is created by the twin photons in the slit path states @xcite . a dichroic mirror placed just after the crystal removes the pump beam and transmits signal and idler beams .",
    "the trigger photon ( idler ) also passes through a double slit and is reflected by the slm , but without the polarizer at its path , no phase change or amplitude variation in its state occurs due to the manner in which the slm works . in fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we show , experimentally , that we are able to introduce spatial phase changes at the signal - photon path state while preserving the state amplitudes by using the slm . however , there are many other maps that the slm can implement in a double slit - qubit",

    "the experimental setup is such that the peak in the x@xmath62 displacement negative region is associated with the inferior slit , _",
    "i.e. _ , with the @xmath35 signal photonic state , while the peak in the positive displacement region is associated with the @xmath36 photonic state .",

    "the slm gray levels were the same as the ones used to obtain the open squares interference pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "we can infer that the slm gray levels used to obtain phase @xmath42 do not attenuate the state amplitude by calculating the areas under the peaks corresponding to each state . in the curve",

    "units , for the @xmath36 state . therefore , with the curves shown in the open squares of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we can implement the @xmath40 map . to implement each @xmath18 a proper gray level",
    "was chosen in each slit , corresponding to add a @xmath42 phase for the value @xmath8 and no extra phase for the value @xmath7 .    to implement the minimal deutsch algorithm",
    "we must create the state @xmath17 for the signal photon and , after the oracle , measure it in the base @xmath15 . by detecting at the fourier plane and at the origin of the interference pattern",
    ", we are able to implement experimentally the detection projector @xmath66 @xcite . using spdc , a double - slit , and by focusing the pump beam at the double - slit s plane",
    ", we prepare the bell state @xmath67@xcite . if we detect the idler photon using the projection operator @xmath66 we project the signal photon state in the state we need .",
    "hence , in our setting , an oracle query corresponds to a detection of the idler photon at the center of the pattern , being the instance where the logical qubit , the signal photon , is prepared in the appropriate state .",
    "the oracle s answer is then provided by the detection or no - detection of the signal photon .",
    "note , moreover , that the idler measurement , and hence logical qubit state preparation , is done after one of the maps @xmath18 is applied on the qubit .",
    "but since these operations commute , this does not affect the final statistics .",
    "the experimental results for all map possibilities are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the measured photon coincidences were obtained with signal and idler detectors kept fixed at @xmath68 , and @xmath63 ( center of the interference pattern ) , respectively , at the fourier plane .",
    "measurements were taken in @xmath69 s. the data show a clear difference of behavior between constant and balanced functions .",
    ".[table1 ] experimental results for all maps possibilities . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the previous section we presented the result of the algorithm using many oracle queries , summarized in table [ table1 ] , which allows , as expected , perfect discrimination between constant and balanced functions ( high and low coincidence counts , respectively ) . the deutsch algorithm is , however , about the optimization of the deutsch problem with regard to the number of queries to the oracle ; and here we discuss what our experimental setup tells us when only one such query is allowed .",
    "however , the meaning of this implementation regarding individual events is more subtle , due , among other reasons , to the fact that an idler photon detection at position @xmath2 corresponds to the preparation of a state @xmath70 for the signal photon , where @xmath71 is a function depending on the detector position and other features of the setting ( see refs.@xcite ) . strictly speaking",
    ", the measurement is not of the von neumman type , on the states @xmath15 , but a positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) .",
    "this means that an infinitesimal detector in @xmath72 measures an operator proportional to @xmath66 , while a finite detector with opening @xmath73 ( that is , the width of the slit placed in front the detector ) measures a positive operator that is a weighted sum of all projectors from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , a signal no - detection event does not necessarily correspond to the state @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] to predict the chances of having a detection ( and hence , also no detection ) event when the function is constant or balanced , by computing the area under the corresponding ( normalized ) curve over an interval centered at the origin with the same width as the detector .    from the graphs themselves , and also from table [ table1 ] , we see that the chances of detecting a photon when the function is constant is much higher then when it is balanced , so indeed a single oracle query gives us some information about the function .",
    "but , in practice , none of the events tell us _ definitely _ which type of function we have .",
    "a detection can also be associated with a balanced function , although it is rare , due to detector width . a no - detection event , on the other hand , might be related to one of three distinct situations : the function is balanced so , as we want , there is a very low probability of detecting a photon at the origin ; or the function is constant , but the detector failed ; the function is constant , but the photon hit the fourier plane at another point away from the detector . due to this third situation , even in a perfect experimental setting a no - detection event can also correspond to a constant function .    to understand better the quantum advantage within this implementation we can consider a scenario where one of these functions is given to us , with equal probability , and we must bet on constant or balanced with only one oracle query .",
    "classically , we can not do better than a fifty - fifty guess , but with this implementation we can .",
    "indeed , from the discussion in the last paragraph , we already see that a detection is more likely to be associated with a constant function , while no detection is more likely to be associated with a balanced one .    to see this in a quantitative manner , let @xmath76 be the event where the function s type is correctly guessed .",
    "we can write the probability for this event as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the probability of having the function @xmath79 while @xmath80 is the probability of success given that function .",
    "we denote by @xmath81 the probability for a photon to hit the fourier plane at a point covered by the detector , given that the function implemented is @xmath82 .",
    "that is , @xmath81 is just the area under the normalized curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] corresponding to the function @xmath83 , in an interval around the origin with the detector s width .",
    "now , if the function is the constant @xmath84 , we succeed in our guess if we detect a photon .",
    "this will take place with probability @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the detector efficiency .",
    "similarly , for @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 . for the function @xmath89 , on the other hand , we succeed if there is no detection , which has probability @xmath90 .",
    "the first term in the sum corresponds to the case where the photon goes to a point away from the detector , while in the second the photon hit the detector but the detector fails .",
    "of course , we have also @xmath91 . since the experiment is designed in a such a way that @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we have finally : @xmath94.\\ ] ]    of course , for any detector width",
    ", the probability is just @xmath95 for @xmath96 , since we do not gain any information about the function .",
    "it then grows linearly with @xmath86 and , for the detector width we have used ( 100@xmath28 m ) , it goes to a maximum of 0.55 .",
    "we could also vary the detector s size by changing the width of the slit placed in front of it , to maximize the right function choice .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows the success probability when the slit size is changed , and the detector is considered perfect .",
    "the best detector slit size is 260 @xmath97 and the corresponding success probability is 0.58 . for certain values",
    "the probability of detecting photons can be larger for balanced functions than for constant ones , so we would infer the function wrongly more often than correctly . of course , we would then have to bet in the opposite way : balanced if we detect a photon , constant if we do not detect anything . for a detector covering the whole plane",
    "we recover the classical fifty - fifty guess since , again , we do not get any information about @xmath6 .",
    "we note finally that in this setting we have an asymmetry between the betting confidence on constant and balanced functions : for small detector sizes , a detection implies a constant function with high probability , while no detection implies a balanced one just with moderate probability . indeed , from bayes formula we can compute : @xmath98    for instance , for a very small detector we have @xmath99 so @xmath100 while @xmath101 .",
    "this is due to our choice of the detector position .",
    "choosing a spot on the fourier plane corresponding to the state @xmath16 would invert this asymmetry .",
    "if a ccd was used instead we would have , on average , the same confidence for betting on both types of functions , but there would still be inconclusive events . if the signal photon were detected by the ccd on a position corresponding to the state preparation , say , @xmath102 , we could not infer the type of function we had . for instance , a detection at position @xmath103 , _",
    "i.e. _ , where the two interference patterns cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , corresponds to such a situation .    , and it is assumed the detection of the idler photon . here the detectors are considered perfect , and we consider the average probability of both detection and no - detection events .",
    "it is assumed that we always bet in a constant ( balanced ) function when there is ( no ) detection .",
    "the optimal size for the detector is 260@xmath28 m , with a success probability of 0.58.,width=340 ]",
    "in this work we implement the minimal deutsch algorithm version with one qubit , using spontaneous parametric down conversion and idler photodetection as a heralded source of one photon and a spatial light modulator as the key part of the quantum oracle .",
