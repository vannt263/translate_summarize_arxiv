    "ultrarelativstic heavy ion collisions are nowadays extensively studied both in theory and experiment .",
    "the collision leads to the creation of hot and dense matter , quark gluon plasma , that soon thermalizes and expands .",
    "this expansion has been successfully described by relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite . since the initial conditions used in hydrodynamic modeling are often complicated , possibly leading to shock waves , sophisticated numerical methods must be used . a class of high - resolution shock - capturing methods particularly suited to solve this problem are godunov methods .",
    "we present a new numerical scheme for ideal relativistic hydrodynamics using the exact solution of riemann problem for an arbitrary equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the ideal relativistic hydrodynamic equations have the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the flow of a conserved charge and @xmath2 is the energy and momentum tensor in the non - dissipative case . in nuclear collisions",
    "the relevant charge is the baryon number , thus @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the flow velocity , @xmath5 being the lorentz factor .",
    "our model covers nuclear collisions at highest energies , where the net baryon density is practically zero .",
    "therefore we do not consider the first equation at all and solve only the second equation that expresses the conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "the energy and momentum tensor has , in the ideal case , this explicit form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy density , @xmath8 is the pressure and @xmath9 is the minkowski metric . the second equation can be rewritten in a different form , useful for numerical implementation , where we employ a vector of conserved variables @xmath10 and the spatial flow of the conserved variables is @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 the presented equations are solved numerically in the latter form using godunov method with an exact riemann solution at the interface . in this method",
    "we consider a piecewise constant distribution of variables inside the cells of a numerical grid . to obtain the value of conserved variables at the next time - step ,",
    "a local riemann problem is solved at each interface of two neighbouring cells .",
    "its solution allows us to compute fluxes of conserved variables @xmath11 at the interface @xcite . for a given cell ,",
    "we then obtain the values of conserved variables at the next time - step by averaging the fluxes on the left and right boundary of the cell : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the value of a variable in the @xmath16 cell at time @xmath17 and @xmath18(@xmath19 ) is the flux at its left ( right ) boundary .",
    "the sound wave propagation test consists of simulating a sound wave of one wavelength in the numerical grid .",
    "we impose the following initial conditions : @xmath20 with parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "since the variation of pressure is sufficiently small @xmath23 , we can consider the linearized analytic solution , a sound wave of velocity @xmath24 , and compare this solution to the values obtained by numerical computation to evaluate the precision of our numerical scheme .",
    "the precision is studied with @xmath25 norm evaluated after one time - step , that corresponds to the period of the wave , with different numbers of cells in the numerical grid @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 the dependence of the @xmath25 norm on the number of cells is shown in the left panel of fig.[lnorm ] .",
    "the precision improves with finer discretization , as expected , and is very good for grids larger than @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29{hq14_lnorm_rev.pdf } & \\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{hq14_visco_rev.pdf } \\end{array}$ ]    despite the fact that we are using ideal hydrodynamics , the numerical computation introduces dissipation into our solution .",
    "since quark gluon plasma is expected to have a very low viscosity , the artificial dissipation of the numerical scheme must be kept very low too .",
    "we have evaluated the numerical viscosity of the scheme @xmath30 , using @xmath25 norm : @xmath31.\\ ] ] we present the dependence of numerical viscosity @xmath30 on the number of cells in the grid in the right panel of fig.[lnorm ] .",
    "similarly to the dependence of @xmath25 norm , it decreases with number of cells and its values are adequately small .",
    "we also evaluated a more suitable parameter - the ratio of numerical viscosity and entropy density in our scheme @xmath32 .",
    "we present its values in fig.[eta2 ] together with values of @xmath33 for pion gas @xcite and the limiting value of @xmath33 for quark - gluon plasma from ads / cft calculations @xmath34 @xcite . from this comparison",
    "we can see that the ratio @xmath32 is sufficiently small for modelling of quark - gluon plasma and will not influence the results due to numeric effects more than the physical viscosity . for simulations in 1d this test shows that suitable grid sizes are @xmath35 .",
    "the 3d case remains to be checked .",
    "( blue points ) compared to the limiting value @xmath36 ( red ) and @xmath33 of pion gas ( green band).,width=283 ]    we continue with the shock tube problem .",
    "it consists of imposing special initial conditions with a discontinuity in energy density in the middle of the spatial domain between two constant states .",
    "the initial conditions in energy density are @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) temperature in the left(right ) half of the numerical grid .",
    "the initial velocity is zero over the whole grid . with time",
    ", we expect to see the dissolution of the discontinuity into a rarefaction wave propagating to the left , to the region of higher energy density , and a shock wave propagating to the right , where energy density is lower .",
    "the shock tube problem has an analytic solution , which allows a good comparison between the numerical and exact solution .",
    "@xmath29{hq14_e_new.pdf } & \\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{hq14_v_new.pdf } \\end{array}$ ]    in the left panel of fig.[energy ] we show the profile of energy density in the grid after 100 time - steps .",
    "we see that the numerical solution ( blue ) is comparable to the analytic solution ( black ) .",
    "the scheme is able to handle the initial discontinuity very well .",
    "the profile of velocity after 100 time - steps , which we show in the right panel of fig.[energy ] , replicates the analytic solution similarly well .",
    "we have built and tested an ideal relativistic hydrodynamic scheme based on the exact solution of riemann problem .",
    "the presented tests in one spatial dimension show a good resolution and ability to capture shock and rarefaction very well .",
    "we will extend this scheme to three dimensions and then apply it in description of the flow in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions .",
