    "the detection of x - ray sources by the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) associated with tts outside star formation regions ( neuhuser 1997 ) gave a tool to find new young associations .",
    "in fact , torres et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and zuckerman & webb ( 2000 ) , using these sources , found evidences for two young associations near the south celestial pole , the horologium ( hora ) and the tucana ( tuca ) associations . to examine the possibility that these associations are the same and to search for other ones we undertook a search for associations containing young - stars ( sacy ) ( de la reza et al .",
    "2001 ; torres et al . 2001 ; quast et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the sacy we selected and observed all bright rass sources that could be associated with tycho-2 or hipparcos stars with ( b - v ) @xmath0 0.6 , excluding very well known rs cvn , w uma , giants , etc in simbad .",
    "we obtained high resolution spectra for the selected candidates with feros echelle spectrograph ( kaufer et al .",
    "1999 ) ( resolution of 50000 ; spectral coverage of 5000 ) of the 1.52 m eso telescope at la silla or with the coud spectrograph ( resolution of 9000 ; spectral coverage of 450 , centered at 6500 ) of the 1.60 m telescope of the observatrio do pico dos dias .",
    "for some stars we obtained radial velocities with coralie at the swiss euler telescope at eso ( queloz et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "> from the collected spectra we have obtained spectral classifications , radial velocities and equivalent widths of lii lines . in particular , the lii line is important since it can provide a first age estimate ( jeffries 1995 ) for late type stars allowing us to select possible post - t tauri stars . for a given star , if its lii resonance line equivalent width is located near or above the lii line delimited by the members of the local associations clusters ( neuhuser 1997 ) , it is flagged as young star .",
    "there are 9574 rosat bright sources in the southern hemisphere , 2071 of them with @xmath0 0.6 in tycho-2 .",
    "until the la serena meeting ( 2002 , march ) we observed 687 stars , and for 170 more stars we got relevant data from the literature .",
    "> from all these stars , 283 fulfill our definition for a young star ( 239 from our spectroscopic observations ) .",
    "as most of these young stars have no hipparcos parallaxes , we applied the following kinematical analysis to find possible associations : each point in uvw velocity space is taken as a convergence point and we calculated for it the parallaxes of all stars such as to minimize the moduli of the space velocity vectors relative to this point ( but , of course , preserving the parallaxes of hipparcos stars ) .",
    "then we calculated the density of stars in the velocity space around each point of a grid in uvw . around some points",
    "there are density concentrations much larger than the background fluctuation , revealing possible associations .",
    "all the main concentrations are also constricted in space , but some of them cover large areas in the sky .",
    "in tables 1 & 2 we present the properties of the eight young associations we found until now . for those that engulf previously known ones , we use bonafide members ( not observed in the sacy ) to help in their definition .",
    "the quantity of bonafide members used are indicated as the last number in table 1 . in table 2",
    "we indicate the distance ( @xmath1 ) of the farthest member to the calculated center of the association , giving an idea of its size . it should be noted that the method gives no unique solution for some stars , but in almost all cases there is an obvious better membership",
    ". as there are important areas not covered until now by the sacy , and specially the sco - cen association region , these identifications are preliminary .",
