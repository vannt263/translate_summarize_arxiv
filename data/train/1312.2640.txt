    "although most of the shf models even with different model parameters can explain the properties of numerous known nuclei consistently , predictions on the properties of the infinite nuclear matter strongly depend on the models , especially at high densities far above the nuclear saturation density @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . as a result",

    "this result shows that the observation of the neutron star can provide constraints on the strangeness content of the proton , and our result implies that kaon condensation , if it occurs , should occur only for heavy neutron stars ( @xmath40 ) , with @xmath38 being greater than @xmath41 mev ( or the strangeness content being smaller than @xmath42 ) .",
    "this small allowed value of strangeness content of the proton is in accordance with experiments @xcite , lattice calculation @xcite , and a recent updated calculation with a chiral effective theory @xcite",
    ". this would be also consistent with the recent observation of cas a and its cooling simulation @xcite because kaon condensation does not affect thermal evolution of neutron stars with smaller mass ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we have discussed the contribution of strangeness by focusing only on the kaon in this work , but we have to consider hyperons as well for the consistency . in the current shf approach , to our knowledge , there are more than 10 models for hyperon - nucleon interactions and 3 models for the hyperon - hyperon interactions in nuclear matter .",
    "our recent analysis shows that the eos at high densities and the resulting mass and radius of neutron star are also highly sensitive to the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions in nuclear medium .",
