    "2008 ; prieto et al .  2008",
    "; anderson & james 2008 ) .    a much more direct method for understanding the relation between types of massive stars and their transients is to catalog all of the massive stars in the local universe ( @xmath10mpc ) before explosion .",
    "while surveys for bright optical transients in the local universe are well - developed ( e.g. , li et al .",
    "2001 ) , a fairly complete census of the massive stars in nearby galaxies has only recently been proposed and undertaken ( massey et al .",
    "2006 ; kochanek et al .",
    "2008 ) . despite the technical challenges required by the depth , area , and cadence of the observations , these surveys are critical for our understanding of the one - to - one correspondence between massive stars and their end - states , whether they are successful or failed explosions ( e.g. , kochanek et al .  2008 ) .",
    "the long - term promise of these surveys is to produce a catalog within which the characteristics of progenitors of future supernovae are listed pre - explosion , as in the case of sn 1987a ( west et al .",

    "we show that these discoveries allow us to make a strong  and perhaps unprecedented  connection between a dust - enshrouded sub - population of massive stars and a new relatively common class of bright transients .",

    "[ section : class ] .",
    "an in - depth search for analogs to the progenitors of sn 2008s and ngc 300 in m33 is presented in  [ section : m33 ] .",
    "transients of this type are relatively common with respect to core - collapse supernovae . _",
    "a total of @xmath1722 core - collapse supernovae or supernova - like transients have been discovered within @xmath18mpc since 1999 .",
    "sixteen were confirmed supernovae , two were lbv eruptions , one was a type iin supernova ( sn 2002bu in ngc 4242 , @xmath19mpc ; puckett & gauthier 2002 ) , whose relatively low peak magnitude ( @xmath20 ; hornoch 2002 ) suggests a close similarity with the remaining two bright transients ( see  [ section : other ] ) , which are of primary interest in this paper : sn 2008s ( @xmath21mpc ) and ngc 300 ( @xmath22mpc ) , whose physical nature is uncertain",
    ". they may be either true ( but optically sub - luminous ) supernovae , or a new class of massive star eruptions .",
    "taken at face value , these numbers imply that the rate of sn 2008s - like transients is of order @xmath23% of the supernova rate .",
    "because of incompleteness , the true rate is likely higher .",
    "we discuss the frequency of these events in detail in  [ section : rates ] .",
    "the progenitors of this class are extremely rare among massive stars at any moment , in any star - forming galaxy .",
    "_ although the bolometric luminosities of the progenitors of sn 2008s and ngc 300 are unremarkable for massive stars ( @xmath15l@xmath1 ) , their colors put them in a class consisting of less than @xmath24 of all massive stars ( @xmath25-[4.5]\\mu$]m color @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) . in a mid - infrared ( mir ) color - magnitude diagram ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : cmd ] & [ fig : cmd2 ] ) , these progenitors lie at the extremum of the agb sequence in both luminosity and mir color . we refer to them as `` extreme agb '' ( eagb ) stars throughout this work . because of their relatively low bolometric luminosities , they are not @xmath28 carinae , cool hypergiant , or classical lbv analogs ( see , e.g. , smith 2008 ) .",
    "they are thus distinct from the `` supernova impostors , '' produced by bright outbursts of optically - luminous lbvs ( e.g. , sn 1997bs ; van dyk et al .  2000 , 2003 ) . in  [ section : m33 ] we present results from a comprehensive survey of m33 for massive stars with properties similar ( in bolometric luminosity , obscuration , and variability ) to the progenitors of sn 2008s and ngc 300 .",

    "we compare with mir surveys of the lmc , smc , and ngc 300 .",
    "conclusion : a large fraction of all massive stars undergo a dust - enshrouded phase within @xmath7yr of explosion .",
    "_ this is the most natural explanation for the facts of points ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above .",
    "if these transients have a rate comparable to the supernova rate ( @xmath3% ; point 2 ) , then the timescale for the obscured phase is determined by the ratio of the number of dust - obscured massive stars relative to the entire population ( @xmath4 ; see  [ section : m33 ] ,  [ section : discussion ] ) times the average lifetime of a massive star ( @xmath29yr ) .",
    "importantly , from the rarity of sn 2008s - like progenitors alone ( @xmath30 of massive stars ; point 3 ) , one would naively expect a comparable fraction of supernovae to have progenitors of this type , if the dust - obscured phase occurs at a random time in the life of a massive star .",
    "however , the relative frequency of these explosions ( point 2 ) shows that this phase must come in the last @xmath7yr , just before explosion .",
    "thus , there must be a causal relation between the occurrence of the highly dust - enshrouded phase and eruption .",
    "these points , together with a discussion of the theory of the evolution of massive stars , the potential connection with electron - capture supernovae , white dwarf birth , and other hypotheses for the physical mechanism of 2008s - like explosions , as well as a call for a more comprehensive _ spitzer _",

    "sn 1997bs is an intriguing example of an object that does not fit into this class , although its peak absolute magnitude , lightcurve , color , and some spectral features are comparable to sn 2008s and ngc 300 . in this case",

    "in particular , sub - luminous type iip sne show balmer lines with strong p - cygni absorption profiles and velocities of a few thousand km s@xmath34 , as is observed in more luminous type iip sne .",
    "this stands in sharp contrast with the balmer lines in sn 2008s - like transients , which are fairly narrow ( @xmath87  km  s@xmath34 ) and which do not show strong p - cygni absorption features . in this way , sn 2008s - like transients most closely resemble the spectra of low - luminosity type iin sne and lbv outbursts .",
    "in addition to the very interesting case of 2002bu , there were five other low - luminosity transients classified as `` impostors '' or `` unknown '' that could have been lbv outbursts , but for which no progenitor has been identified , and which might be 2008s - like : ngc 4656 , sn 2001ac , 2006bv , 2006fp , and 2007sv ( see  [ section : rates ] ) .",
    "however , as we have emphasized and as the sources discussed above imply , the properties of the progenitor can not be deduced from the character of the optical outburst alone ( e.g. , contrast sn 1997bs and sn 2003gm with sn 2008s ) .",
    "thus , in order to understand the causal mapping between progenitor and explosion , a census of the progenitors must first be completed .",

    "although it is difficult to identify a quantitative criterion for inclusion in the class defined by the progenitors of sn 2008s and ngc 300 , it is clear from figure [ fig : cmd ] that the number of analogs in color and magnitude is very small with respect to the total number of massive stars in m33 .",

    "the magnitude limit is straightforward : it is meant to select objects that have bolometric luminosities indicative of massive stars ( @xmath160m@xmath1 ) . in  [ section : sed ] below ,",
    "we show that @xmath158 is conservative ; only half of the 18 sources selected have bolometric luminosities large enough to be massive stars .",

    "our goal was to not miss any deeply - embedded massive stars and the criterion @xmath158 accomplishes that goal .",
    "the cut on color is more complicated .",
    "we were motivated by several factors .",

    "second , this cut essentially eliminates contamination from background active galaxies ( stern et al .",
    "third , the @xmath25-[4.5]>1.5 $ ] cut gives us a reasonable number of objects to assess individually  it is neither too many , nor too few ( again , had we taken @xmath25-[4.5]>2.0 $ ] the sample would consist of just one or two objects ) .",
    "these considerations leave us open to the potential criticism that optically - obscured massive stars may exist in the region @xmath161 ( again , avoiding the agb feature in the cmd ) and with @xmath162-[4.5]<1.5 $ ] . to address this ,",
    "we have examined the 45 sources that occupy this region of the cmd .",
    "four are identified with the lbv candidate catalog from m07 , which we discuss more below .",

    "this is traditionally a very difficult phase to model ( see the summary in woosley et al .",
    "2002 ; siess 2006 ; poelarends et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing explanations for the physics of sn 2008s - like transients is that they result from electron - capture sne ( ecsne ) of o - ne - mg cores of relatively low - mass massive stars ( miyaji et al .  1980 ) . while speculative , this explanation accounts for many of the observed characteristics of both the transients and their progenitors .",
    "in particular , it accounts for the fact that the progenitors of ngc 300 and sn 2008s were relatively low luminosity and deeply embedded .",
    "here we follow the scenario detailed by poelarends et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( see also nomoto 1984 , 1987 ; ritossa et al .  1996 , seiss 2006 , 2007 ; as well as chugai 1997 ;",

    "2009 ) .    we know from the properties of the observed progenitors and our analysis of the luminous stars in m33 that the progenitors are extreme agb stars .",
    "in these systems , the combination of thermal pulses due to he shell burning and dredge - up produces a massive , dusty wind ( for lower luminosity and less enshrouded analogs , see the work on carbon stars in the magellanic clouds by groenewegen et al .",
    "2007 , as well as van loon et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) . in the poelarends et al .",
    "( 2008 ) models , the mass loss peaks at nearly @xmath24m@xmath1 yr@xmath34 for stars of mass @xmath238 and luminosity @xmath239 , and then drops precipitously for slightly more massive stars which can support core neon burning , and which eventually become normal iron - core core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) ( see fig .  13 from poelarends et al .",
    "the thermal pulses driving the mass loss occur at very high rates for the eagb stars ( on timescales of years ) , suggesting that mass loss may appear as a steady wind , as seems to be required for the small variability in the lightcurves of the sn 2008s and ngc 300 progenitors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] ; discussion in p08a ) , rather than as impulsive ejections of optically - thick shells expected for normal carbon stars . the low degree of variability seen in sn 2008s ( particularly when contrasted with the eagb stars in fig .  [ fig : rms ] ) might also be explained by the onset of _ core _ carbon burning as the final phases of stellar evolution commence .",
    "note that the work of nomoto ( 1984 ) and ( 1987 ) implies that the eagb envelope and mass - loss would be carbon - enhanced .    for a narrow mass range near @xmath240m@xmath1",
    ", the balance between mass loss and the growth of the core allows the core to become unstable to collapse without igniting core neon burning , leading to an ecsne .",
    "this occurs only for a small model - dependent mass range near @xmath240m@xmath1 ( see also , e.g. , nomoto 1984 ; seiss 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "poelarends et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimated a mass range of @xmath241m@xmath1 to @xmath242m@xmath1 . for a standard salpeter imf , and assuming that all stars from @xmath243 to 20m@xmath1 form ccsne , then the ecsn fraction is just @xmath244% ( @xmath245m@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is below our ( albeit , uncertain ) fiducial estimate for the rate of sn 2008s - like transients relative to the normal ccsn rate , @xmath225 .",
    "however , other studies have found somewhat broader mass ranges for ecsne .",
    "for example , seiss ( 2007 ) find that @xmath246m@xmath1 , which implies a fractional rate for ecsne more in accord with our nominal estimate for @xmath231 .",
    "while the observed rate of sn 2008s - like transients is uncertain , we have argued that they represent a modest fraction of the normal ccsn rate , consistent with a limited progenitor mass range .",
    "the relatively low luminosity of their progenitors implies that they are low - mass massive stars , potentially near the boundary between electron - capture and normal core - collapse supernovae .",
    "in addition , kitaura et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argue that ecsne should be sub - luminous compared to normal ccsne , because of their low ni yields , potentially explaining the low luminosity of sn 2008s - like transients .",
    "finally , for the fiducial ecsn model of poelarends et al .  (",
    "2008 ) ( see also nomoto 1984 ) , the agb phase lasts for @xmath247yr , which although short with respect to the lifetime of the star itself , is of order @xmath248 in equation ( [ teagb ] ) based on the number of analogs to the sn 2008s and ngc 300 progenitors in m33 . of course",
    ", these timescales need not be identical , since the fiducial ecsn progenitors of poelarends et al",
    ".  may evolve significantly in color as a result of mass - loss during their super-(``extreme '' ) agb phase , becoming increasingly like the sn 2008s and ngc 300 progenitors as they approach the end of their lives .",
    "fortunately , this speculative explanation has at least one simple and testable prediction : there should be no surviving progenitor once the transient fades .",
    "this may be testable in the optical , since most of the dust enshrouding the progenitor was likely destroyed by the explosion , but observations in the mir will be required to be certain that a new shroud has not formed .",
    "a second test is to find strong evidence in the late - time lightcurve for synthesized @xmath36ni .",
    "this may be difficult both because ecsn may produce little @xmath36ni ( kitaura et al .",
    "2006 ) , and because dust , whether that remaining from the eagb phase or dust formed in the ejecta ( e.g. , p08c for m85 ) , may make it difficult to correctly measure the late - time decay rate .",
    "_ spitzer _ may again be key in constraining the nature of these events because of this obscuration .",
    "a third test is to ensure that _ spitzer _ has surveyed all the nearby galaxies so that future examples of these transients can be causally connected to their deeply obscured progenitors . finally , as with ccsne",
    ", very nearby ecsne ( @xmath249kpc ) should produce neutrino signatures characteristic of neutron star formation , which detectors such as superkamiokande and its successors would observe ( see , e.g. , thompson et al .",
    "2003 ; kistler et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the recent paper by botticella et al .  ( 2009 ) in part corroborates the interpretation discussed in prieto et al .",
    "( 2008a ) and proposed here that sn 2008s may be an electron - caputre supernova .",
    "they present the late - time quasi - bolometric lightcurve of sn 2008s , which shows evidence for a power - law time dependence with a slope indicative of being powered by the radioactive decay @xmath36co .",
    "although this need not uniquely signal ecsn as the physical mechanism ( see  [ section : sn ] ) , it provides some evidence for core - collapse , and something perhaps akin to normal neutron star formation ( kitaura et al .",
    "a lightcurve with similar cadence and photometric coverage has recently been published in bond et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for ngc 300 .",
    "heger et al .  (",
    "1997 ) discuss a mechanism for generating a potentially obscuring `` superwind '' via pulsational mass - loss in red supergiants between 10 and 20m@xmath1 during the last @xmath251yr before explosion .",
    "the prediction of enhanced agb - like obscuration ( they compare directly with luminous oh / ir stars ) , the evolutionary timescale ( compare their @xmath251yr with our eq .  [ teagb ] ) , and the secular _ increase _ in the fundamental mode pulsation period as the star approaches death ( see their fig .",
    "7 ) are all in good agreement with the requirements on the 2008s and ngc 300 progenitors we discuss in this paper .",
    "the physical mechanism of iron core - collapse supernovae is unknown ( rampp & janka 2000 ; liebendrfer et al .",
    "2001 ; thompson et al .  2003 ; buras et al .",
    "2003 ; burrows et al .  2006 ) .",
    "recent observations hint that low - luminosity type iip supernovae may be more common than previously thought ( e.g. , chugai & utrobin 2000 ; pastorello et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) , particularly when one accounts for the incompleteness corrections discussed in ",
    "[ section : rates ] . because the mechanism of supernovae has yet to be conclusively identified , it is difficult to interpret the diversity in inferred @xmath252 yield physically .",
    "in fact , that diversity may be larger than previously thought , and we are only now appreciating the existence of a very low - luminosity tail to the type iip luminosity function .",
    "if so , it is natural to imagine that these low - luminosity core - collapse events might have analogs that occur in the very dusty circumstellar medium of their massive stellar progenitors , as in heger et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and thus may give rise to events like sn 2008s and ngc 300 .",
    "this scenario yields many of the predictions of the ecsn scenario discussed in ",
    "[ section : ecsn ] . indeed ,",
    "even with a complete sampling of `` ec- '' and `` cc- '' supernovae , it may be difficult to disentangle the two populations since many of the predictions  radioactive decay powered lightcurves , potentially embedded progenitor , no `` postgenitor ''  are the same in both .      on the basis of the relatively low luminosity of their progenitors",
    ", we view the ecsn and massive white dwarf birth scenarios discussed above as the most probable explanation sn 2008s and ngc 300 . nevertheless , there is of course the possibility that they are instead a new class of outbursts from relatively low - mass massive stars , potentially analogous to the pulsational instabilities discussed in poelarends et al .",
    "( 2008 ) or heger et al .",
    "the majority of the true `` lbv '' eruptions with documented progenitors ( e.g. , 1997bs , 2002 kg ) came from optically bright massive stars significantly more bolometrically luminous than the progenitors of sn 2008s and ngc 300 . as we have shown in figures [ fig : cmd2 ] and [ fig : sed ] , the eagb population is separate from the sources traditionally classified as lbvs : they are less bolometrically luminous and much more dust - obscured .",
    "these facts suggest that if these transients were the outbursts of massive stars then they are distinct from from the classical supernova impostors .",
    "if these events are not supernovae , but merely outbursts , then their existence is likely connected to the physics of the transition between stars that become ecsne and/or ccsne , and those that do not .",
    "the degree of dust - obscuration at outburst is a crucial clue to their evolution .",
    "a simple prediction of this possibility is that the progenitors of sn 2008s and ngc 300 should eventually be re - discovered in the optical and/or infrared after the outburst emission has faded . for further arguments on the nature of sn 2008s and ngc 300 related to this discussion , see bond et al .",

    "<S> the progenitors of sn 2008s and the 2008 luminous transient in ngc 300 were deeply dust - enshrouded massive stars , with extremely red mid - infrared colors and relatively low bolometric luminosities ( @xmath0l@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transients were optically faint compared to normal core - collapse supernovae , with peak absolute visual magnitudes of @xmath2 , and their spectra exhibit narrow balmer and [ ca ii ] emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> these events are unique among transient - progenitor pairs and hence constitute a new class . additional members of this class may include the m85 transient , sn 1999bw , 2002bu , and others . </S>",
    "<S> whether they are true supernovae or bright massive - star eruptions , we argue that their rate is of order @xmath3% of the core - collapse supernova rate in star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is remarkable in light of the observation that a _ very _ small fraction of all massive stars in any one galaxy , at any moment , have the infrared colors of the progenitors of sn 2008s and the ngc 300 transient . </S>",
    "<S> we show this by extracting mid - infrared and optical luminosity , color , and variability properties of massive stars in m33 using archival imaging . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fraction of massive stars with colors consistent with the progenitors of sn 2008s and the ngc 300 transient is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , only @xmath5 similar objects exist in m33 ( and perhaps @xmath6 )  all of which lie at the luminous red extremum of the agb sequence . that these transients are simultaneously relatively _ common _ with respect to supernovae , while their progenitors are remarkably _ rare _ compared to the massive star population , implies that the dust - enshrouded phase is a short - lived phenomenon in the lives of many massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> this shrouded epoch can occur only in the last @xmath7yr before explosion , be it death or merely eruption . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of this finding for the evolution and census of `` low - mass '' massive stars ( i.e. , @xmath8@xmath9m@xmath1 ) , and we connect it with theoretical discussions of electron - capture supernovae near this mass range . </S>",
    "<S> other potential mechanisms , including the explosive birth of massive white dwarfs , and massive star outbursts are also discussed . a systematic census with ( warm ) _ spitzer _ of galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath10 mpc ) for analogous progenitors would significantly improve our knowledge of this channel to massive stellar explosions , and potentially to others with obscured progenitors . </S>"
