    "<S> we construct percolation clusters by randomly choosing a direction @xmath0 in the spin vector space , and then placing a percolation bond between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 with probability @xmath3 , where @xmath4 governs the percolation process . </S>",

    "<S> analysis of the correlation function @xmath8 , defined as the probability that two sites separated by a distance @xmath9 belong to the same percolation cluster , yields algebraic decay for @xmath10 , and the associated critical exponent depends on @xmath11 and @xmath12 . along the threshold line @xmath13 , the scaling dimension for @xmath14 is , within numerical uncertainties , equal to @xmath15 . on this basis , we conjecture that the percolation transition along the @xmath5 line is of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type . </S>"
