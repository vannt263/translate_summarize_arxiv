    "@xmath0 carinae is well known to have experienced a major outburst in the 1840s , during which it became the second brightest star in the entire sky ( e.g. , humphreys & davidson 1999 ) .",
    "known as the _ great eruption _ , this outburst was associated with an episode of extreme mass - loss ( about 10 m@xmath6  of material was expelled in about 20 years ) that resulted in the creation of the bipolar - shaped _ homunculus nebula _ whose current size is about 16@xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath7 , or 0.18 @xmath8 0.11 pc assuming a distance of 2.3 kpc ( walborn 1995 , allen & hillier 1993 ) . over the following decades , the visual brightness of @xmath0 carinae faded by many magnitudes , but early infrared observations by neugebauer & westphal ( 1968 ) revealed that the bolometric luminosity in the second half of the 20@xmath9 century remained comparable to that during the great eruption . the dimming at optical wavelengths resulted from obscuration by dust particles , presumably formed _ in situ _ out of the ejected material .",
    "a scant handful of molecular species have been detected toward @xmath0 carinae .",
    "molecular hydrogen , traced by its 2.12 @xmath10 m line , appears to be distributed over the outer surface of the homunculus nebula , and is strongest towards the polar caps where the intercepted column is largest ( smith 2002 ; 2006 ) .",
    "two other simple diatomic molecules ( ch and oh ) were identified in hubble space telescope stis spectra through their uv absorption lines ( verner et al .",
    "both also originate in the thin outer layer of the homunculus .",
    "finally , radio emission from ammonia ( nh@xmath11 ) was detected by smith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the ammonia emission is confined to a region roughly 1 arcsec across , and shares the kinematics of the h@xmath2 2.12 @xmath10 m line in the same region .",
    "interestingly , carbon monoxide ( co ) has never been detected toward @xmath0 carinae in spite of sensitive searches at millimeter , infrared , and uv wavelengths ( cox & bronfman 1995 ; smith 2002 ; verner et al .",
    "as discussed by smith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , this lack of co detection could reflect the c / o depletion and n enrichment of the material ejected during the great eruption .",
    "indeed , the ionized gas surrounding the homunculus nebula is known to be composed of such nitrogen - rich cno - processed material ( davidson et al .",
    "1982 ; davidson et al .  1986 ; dufour et al .",
    "1997 ; hillier et al .  2001",
    "; smith & morse 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , the abundance of the nitrogen - bearing ammonia molecule in the homunculus itself is estimated to be about 2 @xmath8 10@xmath12 , roughly one order of magnitude higher than in cold interstellar clouds ( smith et al .",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that the existing , unsuccessful , searches for co in @xmath0 carinae are insufficient to place meaningful limits on the [ co]/[nh@xmath11 ] abundance ratio in the homunculus ( smith et al.2006 ) .",
    "thus , the low abundance of carbon monoxide in @xmath0 carinae is still not firmly established .",
    "the formation and survival of molecules in the harsh environment of @xmath0 carinae , within 1@xmath7 ( 0.01 pc ) of a 100 m@xmath6  star , remain poorly understood .",
    "other classes of massive stars ( such as red supergiants and wolf - rayet stars ) are known to be surrounded by significant quantities of molecular gas , although at greater distances , which might indicate that is represents swept - up ambient interstellar material ( pulliam et al .",
    "2011 ; cappa et al .",
    "2001 ; rizzo et al .  2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether or not there is relation between the mechanisms at work in these objects and those occurring in the homunculus . to tackle these issues , it is important to characterize the molecular content of the homunculus , and to determine the physical properties and spatial distribution of the molecular gas . in this _",
    "letter _ , we present new sub - millimeter spectroscopic observations of @xmath0 carinae designed to search for several new molecular species , including carbon monoxide .",
    ".observing log and results [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we mentioned in the introduction that dust grains must have formed out of the material ejected by @xmath0 carinae during the great eruption .",
    "the present results demonstrate that large quantities of molecular material have also formed out of this material",
    ". it will be interesting to analyze the chemistry that led to the formation of these molecules from the theoretical standpoint , because the elemental composition of the gas ( particularly the n and @xmath3c enrichment ) and the physical conditions ( especially the strong uv field ) are very different from those in the interstellar gas .",
    "additionally , the chemistry at play occurred in just a few decades . from the observational point of view",
    ", it will be important to further characterize the molecular content of @xmath0 carinae .",
    "searching for additional nitrogen - bearing molecules such as hc@xmath11n would be particularly interesting . to further characterize the isotopic composition of the gas",
    ", it would also be important to search for molecules containing the @xmath14n , @xmath15o , and @xmath16o isotopes because cno nucleosynthesis models make specific predictions for the relative abundance of these elements .",
    "finally , it would be very interesting to characterize the spatial distribution of the molecular material in the homunculus .",
    "our observations suggest a source size of order 1@xmath7 , but it is clear from the composite nature of the line profiles , that observations at sub - arcsecond resolution would enable a detailed study of the spatial distribution of the molecular material and of its kinematics .",
    "alma will , of course , be the instrument of choice for such observations .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have reported the detection of six new molecules , including carbon monoxide , and two of their less abundant isotopic forms toward @xmath0 carinae .",
    "this triplicates the number of molecules known in this object . while the abundances of co and hco@xmath1 are found to be standard , molecules containing nitrogen or the @xmath3c isotopic form of carbon are over - abundant by about one order of magnitude",
    "this indicates that the material expelled by @xmath0 carinae during the great eruption is cno - processed stellar matter .",
    "additional single - dish and interferometric observations will be very important to further characterize the chemical composition of the gas on the homunculus , and to establish its spatial distribution .",
    "observations of additional nitrogen bearing molecules and of species containing specific isotopes of carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen will be particularly interesting .",
    "herschel spectroscopic observations , currently being collected , will also provide very interesting , complementary information .",
    "we thank arnaud belloche , antoine gusdorf , and friedrich wyrowski for their help with the observations and data reduction .",
