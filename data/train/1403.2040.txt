    "the origin of tiny yet nonvanishing neutrino mass has remained mysterious since its discovery in oscillation experiments .",
    "although such a tiny mass can be incorporated by a trivial extension of the standard model ( sm ) with right - handed neutrinos , it has to appeal to unnaturally small yukawa couplings . in this circumstance , it is more useful to regard sm as an effective field theory in which the neutrino mass appears as a low energy remnant of some high scale physics .",
    "such low energy effects can be systematically organized by higher dimensional operators in terms of the sm fields .",
    "indeed , it has been known for long that such an operator , that is relevant to neutrino mass , first appears at dimension five and has the unique form , @xmath8 , the so - called weinberg operator @xcite . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the sm left - handed lepton doublet and higgs doublet , and @xmath11 is the antisymmetric matrix in the weak isospin space .",
    "the operator is suppressed by an effective coupling @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a heavy mass scale and @xmath14 a product of fundamental couplings of some new physics .",
    "what high scale new physics would be responsible for the operator @xmath15 , and is it accessible in current experiments ?",
    "a nice analysis shows @xcite that , if the operator is a tree level effect of some high - scale fundamental physics , there are three and only three ways to realize it .",
    "it is amusing that they correspond exactly to the three types of conventional seesaws that were suggested previously from different points of view @xcite .",
    "while completely equivalent as far as the neutrino mass at low energies is concerned , these seesaws are indeed vastly different at high energies .",
    "the issue becomes whether they are discernable in the current or near - future experiments , in particular at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the lhc physics of the three seesaws has been explored in this spirit .",
    "the type i seesaw introduces singlet neutrinos whose impact on sm physics enters mainly through their mixing with the sm neutrinos ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this is generically very hard to detect since an appreciable mixing clashes apparently with the desire of tiny neutrino mass and not too heavy new particles .",
    "the seesaw has thus been studied in an effective sense , namely by decoupling the correlation between the heavy mass and mixing parameters that would appear in a genuine type i seesaw . in type ii",
    "seesaw one assumes a scalar triplet carrying the same hypercharge as the sm higgs .",
    "the tininess of neutrino mass is then shared by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the triplet and its yukawa coupling to leptons .",
    "the phenomenology of type ii seesaw is rich , and has been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite .",
    "the type iii seesaw attributes the tiny neutrino mass to the mixing with heavy triplet fermions of zero hypercharge .",
    "this seesaw is potentially rich in phenomenology but more involved than type ii , and has been studied in @xcite .",
    "a comparative study has been made on all three seesaws in ref .",
    "@xcite . both cms and",
    "atlas groups at lhc have set constraints on those seesaws based on various simplifying assumptions @xcite , which will be briefly discussed in section [ sec : production ] . due to the residual tension in the conventional seesaws between heavy mass and small couplings",
    ", there are attempts that combine them in one way or another , or include additional structures ; see for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for the inverse seesaw as an alternative realization of the type i seesaw and refs .",
    "@xcite for its variants . for a partial list of more references , see , @xcite .    because of the tension mentioned above , it is natural to try to go beyond the conventional seesaws",
    "one approach is to diminish the effect of the operator @xmath15 by associating it with additional factors of couplings and loop factors .",
    "this is achieved usually by employing heavy particles that carry new exact or softly broken discrete symmetries , so that the operator can only be induced at the loop level @xcite .",
    "this helps to alleviate the tendency to accommodate tiny neutrino mass by inaccessibly heavy particles and minute couplings to sm particles .",
    "an interesting example in this context is the so - called color - octet model @xcite in which neutrinos gain mass by interacting with new colored particles that could be detectable @xcite at lhc .    a second approach to relax the tension is to raise the dimension of leading operators that are responsible for the neutrino mass , so that they are naturally suppressed by more factors of a high scale .",
    "we recall that regarding sm as an effective field theory the neutrino mass operators are unique at each dimension and have the simple form , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a positive integer @xcite . for this to work at the tree level",
    ", one has to appeal to heavy particles that constitute a higher dimensional irreducible representation of the sm gauge group @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , by choosing the representations judiciously , a higher - dimensional operator can be induced in a systematical and economical manner : the seesaw operates step by step through a cascading process , with each step offering certain amount of suppression .",
    "such models typically contain multiply charged particles that have characteristic decay modes into like - sign multiple leptons or @xmath18 bosons , which could be utilized to remove the sm backgrounds .",
    "the purpose of this work is to explore the feasibility of detecting new particles in the minimal version of the cascade seesaw models .    in the next section we outline the basic idea of the cascade seesaw and",
    "describe in detail its minimal version whose phenomenology will be investigated in the remainder of the paper . in section [ sec : lfv ] , we work out the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) transitions at low energies that are induced in the model .",
    "they turn out to set stringent constraints on the model parameters , and make our analysis of lhc physics more realistic .",
    "the decays of new particles , their production and detection channels at lhc are studied in section [ sec : production ] .",
    "a brief summary of our main results is recapitulated in the last section .",
    "some details of the model , decays , and loop functions are reserved to several appendices .",
    "there are too many possible ways to introduce new fields in order to induce a higher dimensional neutrino mass operator at the tree level .",
    "it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to use as our criteria the following points .",
    "first , for a given set of fields , we assume that the lowest dimension operator @xmath19 dominates the neutrino mass ; namely , we do not consider accidental cancellations in the couplings associated with the mass operators .",
    "second , for a given mass operator , we employ as few new fields as possible to realize it . and",
    "finally , we do not impose any symmetry other than the sm gauge symmetries .",
    "after a careful analysis , the consequences turn out to be very simple @xcite . both new scalars @xmath0 and fermions @xmath1 are necessary to go beyond the three conventional seesaws . and the possibilities are classified according to whether the sm higgs @xmath10 couples to the new fermions @xmath1 or not .",
    "if it does , the option is unique  we need a fermion of weak isospin and hypercharge @xmath20 and a scalar of @xmath21 .",
    "this is the model composed earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite which yields the operator @xmath22 for the neutrino mass .",
    "if @xmath10 does not couple to @xmath1 , the result is a class of models @xcite .",
    "we need one fermion @xmath1 with @xmath23 with integer @xmath24 and a sequence of scalars @xmath25 of @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the sm gauge symmetries dictate that only the scalar of the highest isospin , @xmath28 , can have a yukawa coupling to the fermions @xmath1 and @xmath9 , and that only the scalar of the lowest isospin , @xmath29 , can develop a naturally small vev from interactions with the sm higgs @xmath10 .",
    "the vev is then transmitted by a cascading procedure from @xmath29 up to @xmath28 through scalar interactions , at each step earning an additional suppression from heavy scalar masses .",
    "the end result is a neutrino mass operator @xmath30 that is multiplied by the square of the vev and yukawa coupling of @xmath28 .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the minimal version of the cascade seesaw ; i.e. , we introduce one scalar @xmath0 with @xmath31 and one fermion @xmath1 with @xmath32 , whose members are @xmath33 where the subscripts refer to the electric charge . the sm higgs doublet and lepton fields are , @xmath34 where the subscripts @xmath35 denote the chirality .",
    "we describe some details of the model in the remainder of this section .",

    "the subscript to a pair of parentheses refers to the isospin of the normalized product inside which is obtained by clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the couplings @xmath39 are generally complex and the other parameters are real .",
    "together with the yukawa couplings to be discussed in the next subsection , the @xmath40 terms violate the lepton number by one unit and the @xmath41 term by two units , thus it looks plausible to assume @xmath42 . for simplicity",
