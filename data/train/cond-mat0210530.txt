    "since the discovery of superconductivity in magnesium diboride at elevated ( @xmath8 40 k ) temperature @xcite , considerable progress has been achieved in material synthesis as well as in understanding of its physical properties @xcite . from these initial days of research on superconducting",
    "mgb@xmath0 many attempts were made to tailor the physical properties of the material to suite different needs as well as to explore the neighboring compounds in search of even higher @xmath9 values .",
    "a number of groups undertook synthesis and characterization of ( mg@xmath10t@xmath11)b@xmath12 or mg(b@xmath13m@xmath14)@xmath12 ( t = transition metal , li , be , al ; m = c , si ) materials .",
    "the agenda was multi - fold : to look for changes in @xmath15 , to perform tests of the superconducting mechanisms in mgb@xmath12 , and to introduce additional pinning centers that could lead to higher critical current densities .",
    "since many diborides crystallize in the same , hexagonal alb@xmath12 type of structure as mgb@xmath0 , and these compounds have been known and studied for decades @xcite these substitutions initially were viewed as feasible . in spite of considerable efforts , substitutions in mgb@xmath12 appeared to be difficult and in many cases unsuccessful or , at best , ambiguous .    for magnesium site substitutions",
    "apparently only al was shown to enter the structure unambiguously @xcite although in a limited concentration range .",
    "for boron site substitutions a number of attempts with different elements were made .",
    "carbon substitution was reported in several publications @xcite .",
    "most of these attempts had elemental magnesium , boron and carbon as starting materials and the synthesis was performed at different pressures and temperatures .",
    "the results varied considerably depending on the details of sample synthesis ( for uniformity we refer to the chemical formula written as mg(b@xmath16c@xmath17)@xmath12 ) : carbon solubility less then 1.25% was reported in @xcite , a two - step transition was observed in resistance measurements for nominal @xmath18 @xcite , a solubility limit of approximately @xmath19 and shift of @xmath15 down to @xmath4 34.8 k for @xmath20 was reported in @xcite , a @xmath15 value of 34 k ( at 2% of full diamagnetic signal , @xmath21 3k ) was measured by dc magnetization at 20 oe in mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 ( with no mention of solubility limit ) in @xcite , and a solubility limit of @xmath22 and @xmath15(@xmath23 ) @xmath4 30 k was determined from magnetic measurements in @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties associated with doping of mgb@xmath12 may be the fact that the mgb@xmath12 structure is robust and an intimate , atomic level , mixing of the dopant with the doped element before or in the process of synthesis is required to achieve the substitution .",
    "an interesting approach for carbon doping of mgb@xmath12 was suggested by mickelson _",
    "the starting materials for synthesis were elemental magnesium and boron carbide ( b@xmath24c ) powder .",
    "the result of their synthesis was carbon doped mgb@xmath12 as a majority phase and mgb@xmath12c@xmath12 as a minority phase .",
    "the @xmath15 of the material was decreased by 7 k ( down to 32 k ) as seen by magnetization and resistance measurements .",
    "the resulting composition of the sample was estimated to be mg(b@xmath25c@xmath26)@xmath12 .",
    "this initial study motivated us to attempt to optimize this synthetic route so as to eliminate the impurity phases and to perform a thorough investigation of the physical properties of the resulting material .",
    "samples of carbon doped mgb@xmath12 for this study were synthesized in the form of sintered pellets following the procedure used for pure mgb@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "magnesium lumps ( 99.9% ) and b@xmath24c powder ( 99% - alfa sar ) were sealed into tantalum tubes , sealed in quartz , placed into a heated box furnace and then ( after the desired synthesis time ) quenched to to room temperature .",
    "for all the samples except one ( mgb@xmath12c@xmath27 ) , the nominal stoichiometry was kept as mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 , i. e. mg@xmath28(b@xmath3c)@xmath12 .",
    "synthesis temperature and time were varied systematically so as to optimize sample quality .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements were made at room temperature using cu @xmath29 radiation in a scintag diffractometer .",
    "a si standard was used for all runs .",
    "the si lines were removed from the x - ray diffraction data leading to the apparent gaps in the powder x - ray data .",
    "the lattice parameters were obtained by fitting the x - ray diffraction spectra using _ rietica _ software .",
    "dc magnetization measurements were performed in quantum design mpms-5 and mpms-7 squid magnetometers .",
    "four - probe ac resistance measurements were carried out in quantum design mpms ( with external lr-400 and lr-700 resistance bridges ) and ppms-9 units .",
    "platinum wires were attached to the samples with epotek h20e silver epoxy .",
    "heat capacity data was collected on small pressed pellet samples using the ppms-9 instrument in an applied field of up to 9 t utilizing the relaxation technique .",
    "figure [ berkeley]a presents low field magnetization data for a nominal mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 sample that was synthesized by heating for two hours at @xmath30c and then for two more hours at @xmath31c .",
    "this sample was made using the temperature / time schedule outlined by mickelson _",
    "_ @xcite and serves as a point of comparison .",
    "@xmath15 of this sample ( defined via the onset of diamagnetism criterion ) is @xmath4 30.5 k and the superconducting fraction is significantly less than 100 % . temperature dependent resistance for this sample is shown in the inset of fig . [ berkeley]a .",
    "the resistive transition temperature is consistent with the one determined by magnetic measurements .",
    "the residual resistance ratio @xmath32 = @xmath33(300k)/@xmath34 5.5 ( with @xmath35 defined , in this case , as normal state resistance just above the transition ) .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( see fig . [",
    "berkeley]b ) confirmed that the mg(b@xmath16c@xmath36)@xmath12 phase was formed , however three other phases , mg@xmath12c@xmath37 , mgb@xmath12c@xmath12 and remnants of b@xmath24c were also detected . although the @xmath15 of this sample is comparable with the one reported by mickelson _",
    "@xcite , it appears to be poorly formed and clearly requires optimization .",
    "the presence of unreacted b@xmath24c in the x - ray pattern indicates that the reaction is probably not complete .",
    "our next step in optimization was to increase the reaction time to 24 hours and to perform synthesis at number of different temperatures .",
    "figure [ xrd24h ] presents powder x - ray diffraction spectra for nominal mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 samples synthesized for 24 hours at four different temperatures : 750@xmath38c , 950@xmath38c , 1100@xmath38c , and 1200@xmath38c . whereas the 750@xmath38c/24h sample contains a considerable amount of unreacted b@xmath24c , traces of b@xmath24c are much smaller for the 950@xmath38c/24h sample and are not visible in the xrd patterns of the 1100@xmath38c/24h and 1200@xmath38c/24h samples .",
    "in addition the amount of the two other impurity phases ( mg@xmath12c@xmath37 and mgb@xmath12c@xmath12 ) clearly decrease with an increase in synthesis temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ xrd24h ] ) .",
    "the xrd patterns for 1100@xmath38c/24h and 1200@xmath38c/24h are very similar with respect to the apparent quantities of the impurity phases and present a significant improvement in purity in comparison to the 750@xmath38c/24h and 950@xmath38c/24h samples as well as to the sample reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and data presented in figure [ berkeley ] .",
    "the reactions carried out either at 1100@xmath38c or 1200@xmath38c appear to be approaching single phase .",
    "low field dc magnetization and zero field resistance data taken for the same set of samples also show an evolution of physical properties with the synthesis temperature ( fig . [ mt24h ] ) .",
    "the superconducting transition for the 750@xmath38c/24h sample has an onset of the diamagnetic signal at 29 k but the transition , in fact , is very broad that probably reveals a distribution of transition temperatures within the sample probably due to chemical inhomogeneities .",
    "the transitions as seen in the @xmath39 data sharpen with the increase of the reaction temperature .",
    "the onset temperatures of the diamagnetic signal at the superconducting transition seem to decrease with the increase of the reaction temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ mt24h]a , inset ) , however the temperatures at which the majority of the sample becomes superconducting ( 50% of the transition or maximum in @xmath40 points ) increase with the synthesis temperature for 950@xmath38c/24h - 1200@xmath38c/24h samples . resistance data ( fig .",
    "[ mt24h]b ) manifest a similar trend e.g. the transition width decreases with the increase of reaction temperature .",
    "the transition temperatures defined using @xmath41 criterion are 27 , 19 , 21 , and 21.5 k for reaction temperatures of 750@xmath38c , 950@xmath38c , 1100@xmath38c , and 1200@xmath38c respectively .",
    "@xmath32 decreases from 4.2 to 1.4 with the increase of the reaction temperature .    at this point",
    "we attempt ( with some hesitancy ) to estimate the room temperature resistivity or these samples .",
    "very rough evaluation results in the values : 0.3 m@xmath42-cm , 0.4 m@xmath42-cm , 2 m@xmath42-cm and 2 m@xmath42-cm for 750@xmath38c/24h , 950@xmath38c/24h , 1100@xmath38c/24h , and 1200@xmath38c/24h samples respectively .",
    "these numbers present the _ apparent _ resistivity , with an understanding that ( i ) the porosity of the samples was not taken into account , ( ii ) no attempt was made to account for the possible contributions to the measured resistivity value from grain boundaries and impurity phases . whereas the porosity of different samples prepared by the route described above can be considered as similar and allow for relative comparison of resistivities , we suggest that the possible effects of grain boundaries and impurity phases can not be reliably accounted for within the available data on mg(b@xmath16c@xmath17)@xmath12 compounds and the minority phases encountered in them",
    ". only gross , order - of - magnitude , changes in apparent resistivity may , with some reservations , be taken as reflecting the real evolution of transport properties . keeping this warning in mind we compare the apparent room temperature resistivities of nearly single phase nominal mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 1100@xmath38c/24h and 1200@xmath38c/24h compounds ( 2 - 3 m@xmath42-cm ) with those measured on pellets of pure mgb@xmath12 ( 0.02 - 0.03 m@xmath42-cm @xcite ) synthesized by similar technique using isotopically pure boron .",
    "in addition it should be mentioned that the apparent resistivity for mgb@xmath12 synthesized using only 90% pure boron @xcite was estimated to be 0.1 m@xmath42-cm ( these samples have @xmath43 1.8 , similar to carbon doped 1100@xmath38c/24h and 1200@xmath38c/24h compounds ) .",
    "in addition , no literature reports on bulk , nominally pure mgb@xmath12 prepared by different techniques report a room temperature resistivity value above several tenths of a m@xmath42-cm . based on these comparisons",
    "we conclude that our nearly single phase nominal mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 has a room temperature resistivity that appears to be significantly higher than pure mgb@xmath12 .",
    "any conclusion beyond this fairly gross , qualitative statement runs the risk of over interpreting these data .    since in a number of applications synthesis at lower temperatures",
    "can be beneficial and because the details of the reaction between elemental mg with b@xmath24c are not known , we have checked to see if by performing this reaction at lower temperatures but longer time we can obtain a material of similar or superior quality to the 1100@xmath38c/24h - 1200@xmath38c/24h samples .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns taken on samples reacted at 950@xmath38c for 3 hours , 24 hours and 5 days are shown in fig .",
    "[ xrd950 ] . for",
    "this reaction temperature the samples tend to improve with increasing reaction time , the intensities of the peaks corresponding to impurity phases monotonically decrease as reaction time increases from 3 h to 24 h to 5 days .",
    "the traces of unreacted b@xmath24c are not seen for 950@xmath38c/5 days sample but mg@xmath12c@xmath37 and mgb@xmath12c@xmath12 are still clearly detectable .",
    "the quality of this sample ( as inferred from xrd data ) is approaching that of the sample synthesized at 1100@xmath38c or 1200@xmath38c for 24 hours",
    "( compare figs .",
    "[ xrd24h ] and [ xrd950 ] ) but is still apparently inferior .",
    "similarly , the low field magnetization ( see fig .",
    "[ mt950]a ) shows a gradual decrease of the width of the transition , indicating more homogenous samples , with the increase of the reaction time .",
    "temperature dependent resistance data ( fig .",
    "[ mt950]b ) follow the same trend : transition width decreases with increases in the reaction time",
    ". the resistive transition temperatures ( from @xmath33 = 0 ) are 19 , 19 , and 18 k for the 3 h , 24 h , and 5 days reaction times .",
    "the @xmath32 values decrease from 3 to 1.3 with the increase of the reaction time . on the other hand the transitions seen for all reaction times , even the 950@xmath38c/5 days sample , are all significantly broader than those seen for the 1100@xmath38c/24 h and 1200@xmath38c/24h samples .    based on the analysis of the two aforementioned data sets ,",
    "the 1100@xmath38c/24h - 1200@xmath38c/24h reactions appear to optimize the sample quality .",
    "having this in mind we wanted to address one final synthesis concern : would samples with nominal stoichiometry of mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 or mgb@xmath12c@xmath27 be cleaner , i. e. do we get better samples with a mg : b ratio of 1:2 or a mg:(b +",
    "c ) ratio of 1:2 ? both types of samples we synthesized following the 1100@xmath38c/24h schedule .",
    "powder xrd spectra ( fig .",
    "[ xrdsto ] ) attest to the fact that the mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 sample is cleaner .",
    "low field temperature dependent magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ mtsto ] ) show that the transition temperatures of these two samples are virtually identical with a possibly slightly higher superconducting fraction found for the mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 sample .",
    "apparently the change to a mgb@xmath12c@xmath27 initial stoichiometry does not improve the purity of the phase or sharpness of the superconducting transition but does promote unwanted second phases .    to summarize , the analysis of the three sets of samples discussed above ( having reaction temperature , reaction time and the mg : b@xmath24c ratio as variables ) we find that within the limitations of our synthesis route the mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 samples reacted at 1100@xmath38c/24h - 1200@xmath38c/24h are the closest to being single phase samples and have sharper superconducting transition as seen in the temperature dependent resistance and low field magnetization data .",
    "the transition for these samples has shifted down by @xmath4 17 k ( @xmath8 22 k ) with respect to pure mgb@xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath44-lattice parameter is approximately 1.2% smaller than for pure mgb@xmath12 whereas the @xmath45-lattice parameter remains practically unchanged , a trend consistent with previous data @xcite .",
    "the phase purity of these samples is better than that of the sample reported by mickelson _",
    "_ @xcite and clearly much better than the sample described in figure [ berkeley ] . from the resistance data for the two sets of samples",
    "( with reaction temperature or reaction time being varied ) it appears that the more phase - pure and homogenous samples have lower residual resistance ratios .",
    "this observation is opposite to what follows from the mattheissen s rule and is consistent with significant extrinsic contribution to the normal state resistance ( and @xmath32 ) from other phases , grain boundaries , etc .",
    "that render attempts to use even semiquantitative arguments based on normal state transport properties , e. g. the testardi correlation @xcite , for such samples ambiguous . on the other hand",
    ", it is fairly clear that the intrinsic resistivity of the mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 samples is significantly higher than that of our pure mgb@xmath12 samples @xcite .",
    "a serious shortcoming of carbon doping through this ( mg + b@xmath24c ) reaction route is that determination of the carbon content in the final sample appears to be a difficult and non - trivial task . in this report",
    "we will not attempt to address this issue for our samples and will leave this problem for future work . it should be noted that reliable and accurate quantitative determination of the carbon content ( @xmath46 ) and/or _ consistent _ relation between three parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath46 and @xmath44-lattice parameter ( since @xmath45 is practically constant in all reports ) can not be found in the available literature @xcite . as an aside note we would like to mention that we attempted to dope mgb@xmath12 with silicon and phosphorus through ( mg + b@xmath47si ) and ( mg + b@xmath48p@xmath12 ) synthesis routes .",
    "these attempts were apparently not successful and resulted in multiphased compounds with no indication of doping into b site .",
    "once the best available synthesis route was established , the nearly single phase 1100@xmath38c/24h sample was chosen for more detailed measurements of physical properties .",
    "[ rt ] presents the temperature dependent resistance measurements taken in different applied fields up to 9 t ( an enlarged region near the superconducting transition in 0 - 9 t field range is shown ) . unlike the case of pure mgb@xmath12 samples",
    "@xcite practically no magnetoresistance in the normal state was observed .",
    "this is consistent with the very low residual resistance ratio , @xmath43 1.6 for this sample and high estimated @xmath49 .",
    "the magnetotransport data ( fig .",
    "[ rt ] ) together with field and temperature dependent magnetization data ( not shown here ) were used to determine the upper critical field for this sample ( fig .",
    "[ hc2 ] ) . the irreversibility line ( @xmath50 ) shown in this figure was determined from @xmath51 loops taken at different temperatures .",
    "the irreversibility field for this sample is quite low : it extrapolates to @xmath52 2 t , which probably points to the fact that the carbon substitutions in the sample prepared from the mg and b@xmath24c mixture at 1100@xmath38c/24h conditions do not significantly increase the pinning . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath53 slope for this sample is considerably steeper than in pure mgb@xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ hc2 ] , inset ) , so although @xmath15 of the carbon doped sample is approximately half of that for pure mgb@xmath12 , the extrapolation @xmath54 will give the value close to 16 t , similar to that of high purity mgb@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "[ jc ] presents the critical current density for the 1100@xmath38c/24h sample as determined from magnetization loops using the bean model @xcite .",
    "the critical current densities are quite low , @xmath55(1.8k , @xmath56=0 ) @xmath4 30 ka/@xmath57 , which is consistent with low pinning and the low lying irreversibility line ( fig .",

    "the heat capacity of the 1100@xmath38c/24h nominal mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 sample was measured on two different pressed pellets , from two separate batches in zero and 9 t applied field .",

    "the significant decrease in @xmath15 is consistent with lower @xmath62 and @xmath63 values for the carbon doped sample . the heat capacity difference @xmath64 as a function of temperature for the two different samples",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "both qualitatively and quantitatively the two sets of data are similar but it is worth noting that there is some sample - to - sample and measurement - to - measurement variation .",

    "[ hc_2 ] in the form of @xmath65 as a function of temperature .",
    "the shift in the specific heat jump at superconducting transition is a manifestation of the upper critical field and is consistent with @xmath53 measured by other techniques ( see stars in fig .",

    "the more interesting feature appears to be the low temperature shoulder in the excess of specific heat seen in @xmath66 data below 10 k ( also clearly seen for both samples in the previous figure ) .",
    "a similar feature was observed in pure mgb@xmath12 by different groups @xcite and was interpreted as experimental evidence of a second , much lower energy , superconducting gap in mgb@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "there are other important similarities between heat capacity data of pure magnesium diboride and the carbon doped sample : the low temperature feature disappears ( lower gap is quenched ) in small ( 0.5 t ) applied field and the @xmath67 value is substantially smaller than expected for a bcs superconductors .",
    "these two peculiar results were shown to be present in pure mgb@xmath12 and to be consequences of the two - gap nature of superconductivity in this material .",
    "these similarities in heat the capacity data of pure and carbon doped magnesium diboride imply that despite the significantly suppressed @xmath15 and apparently large increase in resistivity , the novel double gap nature of supercondutivity persists in our nominal mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 samples .",
    "it is worth noting whereas there have been estimates of @xmath8 20 k for `` isotropic '' ( single gap ) mgb@xmath12 @xcite the case we seem to find for our nominal mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 appears to be quite different with two distinct gaps .",
    "further research will be required to confirm this initial observation but , as it currently stands , this finding requires that the two superconducting gaps survive quite dramatic perturbations .",
    "finally , the anisotropic upper critical field for carbon doped mgb@xmath12 was evaluated from temperature dependent magnetization measurements following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "although the feature corresponding to @xmath68 in @xmath69 for this sample was slightly broader than for pure mgb@xmath12 it was possible to trace @xmath70 above @xmath4 12 k ( see fig .",

    "the synthesis of carbon doped magnesium diboride from magnesium and boron carbide ( b@xmath24c ) with a nominal stoichiometry of mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 was optimized and resulted in nearly single phase material with @xmath8 22 k. samples obtained by this route have an upper critical field of @xmath4 9 t at 10 k and the slope of @xmath53 is much steeper than for pure mgb@xmath12 .",
    "the sample has moderate @xmath55 values pointing out that carbon introduced in the lattice via this synthetic route does not increase pinning significantly .",
    "the specific heat data taken in different applied fields suggest that the two gap superconductivity is preserved in the mg(b@xmath1c@xmath2)@xmath12 sample despite the heavily suppressed @xmath15 .",
