    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is host to a large population of @xmath350 high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , comparable to the number known in the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , unlike the galactic population , all of these systems but one are be / x - ray binary ( be - xrb ) systems , with the exception ( smc - x1 ) containing a supergiant companion instead @xcite .",
    "the wing of the smc is the region linking the eastern side of the smc to the bridge . despite its lower content of gas , dust , and stars",
    ", it had a major star forming event @xmath311 myr ago and appears , as expected , deficient in be - xrbs @xcite .",
    "note however that the coverage of the smc wing by x - ray observations has been sparser than that of the bar .",
    "each new discovery of a be - xrb in the smc wing is therefore particularly noteworthy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have conducted _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of the far eastern region of the wing , concentrating on the star forming region ngc602 .",
    "the full description of these observations will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( oskinova et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in this letter , we concentrate on one bright x - ray source located near ngc602 in projection and coinciding with the emission - line star 2dfs3831 ( r.a .",

    "@xmath5 , j2000.0 ) , which is revealed as a be - xrb . based on the results of section [ timing ] , throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to the x - ray source as sxp1062 following the nomenclature of @xcite for smc x - ray pulsars .",
    "the stellar population of ngc602 ( which comprises three star clusters : ngc602a , b , and c ) has been studied in detail .",
    "in addition to very old stars of 6 - 8 gyr , likely the smc field population , the ngc602 clusters contains young stars of @xmath34 - 5myr @xcite .",
    "the significant number of young stellar objects detected in the ngc602a cluster @xcite suggests that star formation is still ongoing . as for what initially triggered the formation of these clusters , the low density environment in the wing of the smc hints at an additional mechanism acting along with gravitational collapse .",
    "ngc602 is located at the intersection of three h@xmath1i shells , and @xcite suggested that its formation is the result of the interaction of two expanding shells @xmath37 myr ago .",
    "@xcite proposed instead that star formation was possibly induced by encounters with the large magellanic cloud or the milky way .",
    "ngc602 is associated with sgs - smc1 , the only h@xmath0 supergiant shell known in the smc .",
    "the discovery of a be - xrb in this area ( only @xmath37@xmath6 to the west of ngc602a ) provides important clues to the star formation history in the wing and the evolution of large - scale structures in the interstellar medium .",
    "this letter is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the x - ray observations and analysis in section [ x - ray ] . in section [ optical ] ,",
    "we present the spectroscopy of the optical counterpart .",
    "we discuss the properties and environment of sxp1062 in section [ discussion ] and present our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "the x - ray data were obtained with the acis - i camera on the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory and with the epic cameras onboard _ xmm - newton_. the _ chandra _ observations consisted of 11 separate exposures acquired between 2010 - 03 - 31 and 2010 - 04 - 29 ( effective exposure time of 290.7ks ) , while 4 separate exposures were obtained with _ xmm - newton _ between 2010 - 03 - 25 and 2010 - 04 - 12 ( epic - pn effective exposure time of 162.5ks ) . the data were reduced using the most up - to - date versions of the corresponding data reduction software .",
    "the x - ray source cxoj012745.97 - 733256.5 ( = sxp1062 ) coinciding with the optical emission - line star 2dfs3831 is detected in each of these 15 exposures . in the _ chandra _ observations ,",
    "the positional uncertainty ( 1@xmath7 ) of the x - ray source is @xmath8 .",
    "the source was also detected during an _ xmm - newton _",
    "slew on 2009 - 11 - 16 .",
    "interestingly , the source was not detected in the _",
    "rosat all sky survey _ , although at its present luminosity it would have been bright enough at an expected _ rosat _ pspc count rate of 0.01 counts  s@xmath9 .",
    "figure[bestfit_spec ] shows the combined background - subtracted _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ spectra of sxp1062 .",
    "spectra were extracted from a 128 circular region and the background was extracted from a concentric annular region of radii 128 and 192 which was free of sources .",
    "likewise , the _ xmm - newton _ spectra were extracted from a 32  circular region and the background from 4 adjacent circular regions free of sources with radius 45 .        [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as a first step the background - subtracted _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ spectra of sxp1062 were simultaneously fitted using a simple absorbed power - law model .",
    "the best - fit parameters , listed in table[tab : fit ] , imply an absorbed flux in the energy range 0.2 - 12.0 kev of @xmath10=1.8@xmath1110@xmath12  erg  @xmath13  s@xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds to an intrinsic x - ray luminosity in this same energy range of @xmath14=6.9@xmath1110@xmath15  erg  s@xmath9 assuming a distance modulus of 18.7 appropriate for the wing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or @xmath16=8.2@xmath1110@xmath15  erg  s@xmath9 for the ` standard ' smc distance modulus of 18.9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the photon index @xmath17 of @xmath30.75 is typical of x - ray pulsar binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a signature of accretion onto a strongly magnetized neutron star .",
    "the simple power - law model suggests some emission excess below 1 kev and at high energies . as a next step",
    ", we added a blackbody component , which statistically improved the fit ( see table[tab : fit ] ) .",
    "the observed x - ray flux is similar to that of the previous model , but the x - ray luminosity decreases by @xmath18 .",
    "we also tried a model for which a thermal plasma component with smc abundances is included instead of a blackbody . similarly to the blackbody , the addition of a thermal component to the power - law model improves the fit . in this case , the intrinsic x - ray luminosity is only marginally greater by @xmath19 compared to the simple power - law model .",
    "finally , the best fit is achieved by adding simultaneously a thermal and a blackbody component to the power - law ( see table[tab : fit ] and figure[bestfit_spec ] ) . the flux for this model ( pbt in table [ tab : fit ] )",
    "is @xmath20=1.66@xmath2110@xmath12 erg  @xmath13  s@xmath9 , corresponding to an intrinsic luminosity @xmath226.3@xmath2310@xmath15  erg  s@xmath9 for a distance modulus of 18.7 .",
    "the column densities are well constrained by spectral fitting , albeit the values slightly differ depending on the model . using the best - fit values , we note that the h column densities in table[tab : fit ] imply @xmath24 mag for the @xmath25/@xmath26 ratio of @xmath27@xmath13 , i.e. @xmath28 assuming @xmath29 .",
    "this range is in good agreement with the @xmath30 value computed by comparing the value @xmath31 of 2dfs3831 @xcite with the intrinsic value @xmath32 of a b0 - 0.5iii star @xcite given the uncertainties on the photometry and spectral type ( see section [ optical ] for the optical spectroscopy of 2dfs3831 ) .",
    "the photon arrival times were corrected for the solar system barycenter .",
    "we searched for pulsations in the x - ray light curves in the soft and hard energy bands ( 0.4kev1.5kev , 2.0kev7.2kev ) and a total energy band ( 0.4kev7.2kev ) , using fast fourier transform and light - curve folding techniques as implemented in the timing analysis software _",
    "xronos_.    figure[power ] shows the inferred _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ power density spectra in the soft and hard energy bands with a clear peak at a frequency of @xmath33hz ( p=1062s ) . this coherent x - ray pulse period establishes the source as a binary x - ray pulsar .",
    "the pulse profiles folded with this period are shown in figure [ pulse ] .",
    "the light - curves used to compute the _ xmm - newton _ power spectrum in the hard energy band , the _ xmm - newton _ power spectrum in the soft energy band , and the _ chandra _ power spectrum in the hard energy band were binned by respectively 5s , 200s , and 200s .",
    "the 5s bin time for one of these was chosen to make sure that a shorter pulse was not missed .",
    "no pulse was found in the soft band _",
    "observations , possibly because the count rate is too low . because of the softer response of the epic - pn camera , the pulse in the soft band is the most obvious in the light - curves obtained with this instrument .",
    "note that in addition to the pulse period , x - ray variability was also detected at a level of @xmath34 peak - to - peak on a timescale of several days in both _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ light - curves .",
    "given that this variability does not appear regular and that the time sampling is very sparse , we do not analyse these variations further .",
    "from its x - ray position with subarcsecond precision from _ chandra _ images , the optical counterpart to sxp1062 is identified as 2dfs3831 @xcite .",
    "we observed this star with the vlt flames instrument @xcite on 2010 october 25 as part of a spectroscopic survey of massive stars in ngc602 complementing our x - ray observations .",
    "spectra were obtained in the medusa - fibre mode of flames using the lr02 setting of the giraffe spectrograph ( 39604564  , r=7000 , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "five pairs of 1800s exposures were obtained .",
    "the standard data processing ( bias subtraction , fibre location , summed extractions , division by flat - field , wavelength calibration ) was done using the eso common pipeline library flames reduction routines ( v.2.8.7 ) .",
    "additionally , heliocentric correction and subtraction of a median sky spectrum were performed ( for details see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spectra from all the exposures were then normalized and merged .",
    "the 2df spectra of this star were also retrieved .",
    "these two spectra cover the regions from @xmath33800 to 4900   and @xmath36000 to 7000  , with resolving powers of 1500 and 2500 respectively @xcite .",
    "figure [ opt ] shows the vlt flames and 2df spectra of 2dfs3831 .",
    "the vlt flames spectrum has been smoothed and rebinned to an equivalent resolving power of r=4000 .",
    "a weak he@xmath1ii @xmath354542 absorption line is visible in the vlt flames spectrum and there is a hint of a weak he@xmath1ii @xmath354686 line in the 2df spectrum , but he@xmath1ii @xmath354200 is absent , suggesting a spectral type around b0 - 0.5 following the classification adopted by @xcite .",
    "several characteristics attributable to a circumstellar disc indicate that 2dfs3831 is a classical be star .",
    "fe@xmath1ii @xmath354179 and fe@xmath1ii @xmath354233 emission lines typical of some early be stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are visible in the vlt flames spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission seen in the 2df spectrum ( see the right panel in fig.[opt ] ) is relatively strong with an equivalent width ( ew ) of -23 .",
    "there is significant h@xmath36 emission , plus emission in the core of the other balmer lines ( double - peaked in the vlt flames spectrum ) and apparent infilling of the he@xmath1i absorption lines .",
    "two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) jhk@xmath37 photometry also indicates a clear infrared excess when compared with expected colors for a b0 - 0.5 spectral type @xcite .",
    "the double - peaked emission in the balmer lines is not due to oversubtraction of nebular features present in the median sky spectrum .",
    "also , given the relative weakness of the nebular emission lines in the mean sky spectrum , the emission in the core of the balmer lines is most likely dominated by circumstellar material and not by nebular contamination .",
    "the observed magnitude ( v=14.36 , b=14.32 ; * ? ? ? * ) and a range of reasonable extinction estimates ( including both the interstellar and circumstellar components ) lead to an absolute magnitude consistent with a b0 - 0.5 giant @xcite .",
    "we thus determine the spectral type of 2dfs3831 as b0 - 0.5(iii)e+ , where ` + ' signifies the presence of fe@xmath1ii .",
    "this corresponds to a typical effective temperature @xmath38k and an evolutionary mass @xmath39 at smc metallicity ( cf .",
    "we estimated the radial velocity of 2dfs3831 from the vlt flames spectrum by fitting gaussian profiles to the wings of h@xmath40 , h@xmath41 , h@xmath42 , he@xmath1i @xmath354143 , and he@xmath1i @xmath354388 .",
    "the average of all measurements is 167 with a standard deviation of 13 .",
    "this is consistent with the mean velocity of massive stars in the smc @xcite , and also with the gas velocities measured by @xcite across the n90 h@xmath1ii region ionized by ngc602a .",
    "thus , we do not see any evidence that the hmxb acquired a high space velocity following the supernova explosion .",
    "sxp1062 is only the third smc x - ray pulsar with a spin period larger than 1000s @xcite .",
    "these slowly rotating pulsars are particularly interesting because they represent a challenge for the theory of spin evolution of a neutron star in a close binary system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to the corbet diagram for smc be - xrbs relating spin and orbital period @xcite , we expect sxp1062 to have a binary period of @xmath3300 days .",
    "such a long orbital period is also expected from the @xmath43-ew(h@xmath0 ) diagram @xcite , from which our measured ew(h@xmath0 ) suggests an orbital period of @xmath3100 days .",
    "note however that the maximum ew(h@xmath0 ) of the system , which probes the maximum size of the disc ( and indirectly the orbital period ) , could be higher than our instantaneous measurement , so this period estimate should be taken as a lower limit .",
    "sxp1062 shares many characteristics with the class of persistent be - xrbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : a relatively low x - ray luminosity @xmath44ergs@xmath9 , a slowly rotating pulsar with @xmath45s , a relatively flat light curve with sporadic and unpredicted increases in intensity by less than an order of magnitude , and a lack of iron lines at @xmath36.4kev indicative of small amounts of material in the vicinity of the neutron star .",
    "a thermal excess of blackbody type , with a high temperature ( @xmath46kev ) and a small emission area ( @xmath47 km , consistent with a hot spot at the polar cap of the neutron star ) has recently been suggested as a common feature of persistent be - xrbs @xcite .",
    "such a component is also identified in the x - ray spectrum of sxp1062 , for which we infer a size of @xmath48 km for the blackbody source from our best - fit models ( section[xspec ] ) .",
    "a shell nebula is detected around sxp1062 in the magellanic cloud emission - line survey ( mcels ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) h@xmath0 image and in the higher resolution ctio 4 m mosaic @xcite h@xmath0 image ( see figure  [ mcels ] ) .",
    "this shell is also detected in the mcels [ o@xmath1iii ] image , but hardly in [ s@xmath1ii ] .",
    "we adopt below a distance modulus of 18.7 .",
    "the shell is not uniform , with radii varying from 75@xmath49 at the sharp rim on the northeast to 94@xmath49 at the diffuse edge on the southwest .",
    "the peak surface brightness of the northeast rim is @xmath50 ergs @xmath13 s@xmath9 arcsec@xmath51 , corresponding to an emission measure of 30 @xmath52 pc .",
    "the width of the rim suggests that the shell thickness ( @xmath53 ) is 510% of the shell radius ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the longest emitting length at the shell rim is @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] ; thus , the rms density in the shell is 1.3@xmath560.3 h - atom @xmath57 .",
    "the gas mass in the shell is 250@xmath56100 @xmath58 .",
    "this large mass indicates that the shell gas must be dominated by interstellar material .",
    "the shell morphology resembles supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the x - ray images also suggest that diffuse x - ray emission possibly associated with a snr may be present in the vicinity of sxp1062 ( oskinova et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "as the shell mass is much larger than the typical supernova ejecta mass , we assume that the shell is a snr in the sedov phase .",
    "the kinetic energy in the shell would be @xmath330% of the supernova explosion energy . adopting a canonical explosion energy of 10@xmath59 ergs ,",
    "the current shell kinetic energy is @xmath60 ergs , and implies a shell expansion velocity of 350@xmath56100 km  s@xmath9 and an age of 0.4(@xmath61)=@xmath2  yr .",
    "this age is much larger than the cooling timescale of this low density gas , justifying an adiabatic shock for the sedov phase . the pre - shock interstellar gas density , 1/4 the shell density , is @xmath62 h - atom @xmath57 , consistent with the low density expected in the smc wing .",
    "the bright [ o@xmath1iii ] emission can be easily produced by a 350 km  s@xmath9 shock ( cf .",
    "the ionizing flux of the b00.5iii star can easily photoionize the shell gas and its surrounding pre - shock medium ; furthermore , the diffuse [ o@xmath1iii ] emission to the northeast exterior of the shell indicates the existence of a harsh radiation field ; therefore , the ionization stage of the pre - shock medium may be too high to produce strong post - shock [ s@xmath1ii ] emission . we thus conclude that the shell nebula detected around sxp1062 is most likely a snr .",
    "the extent of the shell , which has not reached the ngc602 region , and its young kinematic age suggest that this supernova event did not trigger the formation of ngc602 .",
    "image and mcels h@xmath0 , [ s@xmath1ii ] , and [ o@xmath1iii ] images of a region centered on the position of 2dfs3831=sxp1062 and showing the shell nebula detected around the target.,width=302 ]",
    "we reported the discovery of a be - xrb , sxp1062 , containing one of the slowest rotating x - ray pulsars in the smc .",
    "we suggest that the shell nebula detected around this object is a snr .",
    "its estimated kinematic age of @xmath2  yr is probably the age of the pulsar .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the first discovery of a pulsar associated with a supernova remnant in the smc .",
