    "the critical behavior of fluids , including the issues of exponents and universality class and the magnitudes of non - universal quantities , such as the location of critical points , has been much studied by monte carlo simulations of model systems with the aid of increasingly powerful computers . however , since simulations always deal with finite systems , say of linear dimensions @xmath3 , a precise calculation can do no more than reveal details of the rounding of the system s properties in the critical region : a sharp critical point is attained only in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "thus the analysis of finite - size effects by suitable scaling concepts and subsequent extrapolation is a key ingredient for the success of such investigations.@xmath15    a notable advance in this respect was made in 1992 when bruce and wilding@xmath16 ( bw ) developed a special finite - size _ mixed - field _ scaling technique or `` recipe '' that has been widely used in deriving critical parameter estimates for a variety of more - or - less realistic model fluids.@xmath17 in their approach the joint distribution function , @xmath18 , of the ( number ) density @xmath19 and the configurational energy density , @xmath20 , for a finite - size system of volume @xmath21 and dimensions @xmath3@xmath22@xmath3@xmath22@xmath23@xmath22@xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions is calculated via grand canonical ensemble simulations of the model fluid at temperature @xmath24 and chemical potential @xmath25 . within scaling theory bw then described this joint distribution of density and energy fluctuations in a finite near - critical fluid by incorporating the mixing of two _ relevant scaling fields _ ; in other words , the ordering field @xmath26 ( conjugate to the order parameter ) and the thermal field @xmath27 ( conjugate to the critical energy density ) were taken as _ linear combinations _ of the `` bare '' physical fields , @xmath28 and @xmath29.@xmath30 this mixing of @xmath31 and @xmath32 into the scaling fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a crucial manifestation of the _ lack _ of particle - hole _ symmetry_. an analysis of a @xmath33@xmath34@xmath35-dimensional lennard - jones fluid using monte carlo simulations confirmed this mixing.@xmath36 the observed ( or calculated ) joint distribution was then related to the _ universal _ critical - point distribution for the ising model , to which universality class `` typical '' fluids are generally believed to belong .",
    "it was found@xmath36 that the _ limiting _ critical behavior of the density distribution assumed a scaling form , as expected ; furthermore , the shape of the distribution could be quite well matched to the known universal order - parameter distribution function appropriate to the ising class .",
    "this served to illuminate the underlying basis of the universality shared by simple fluids and ising ferromagnets .",
    "by such a matching of the distribution functions of density and energy to the limiting universal functions  that were obtained _ a priori _ via computer simulations of simple , symmetric ising models@xmath37  wilding and subsequent collaborators were able to estimate the critical parameters and the mixing coefficients for more general continuum model fluids .",
    "although the bw method has proved convenient and straightforward and has been successfully applied to estimating the critical parameters in various models , it suffers from certain weaknesses .",
    "one of its weakest points is that various crucial features of the critical behavior of the model under the investigation must be known _ a priori_. in particular ,",
    "the method requires precise advance knowledge of the fixed - point distribution functions .",
    "indeed , camp and patey@xmath38 recently studied criticality in three - dimensional model fluids with algebraically decaying attractive pair interactions varying as @xmath39 with exponent values @xmath40 and @xmath41 , via grand canonical monte carlo simulations .",
    "when they applied the bw method , they found that the order - parameter distribution for @xmath42 could be well matched to the ising fixed - point function ; this is , in fact , consistent with the renormalization group theory conclusion that for @xmath43 the system belongs to the ising universality class.@xmath44    on the other hand , they observed that for @xmath45 and @xmath41 the order - parameter distributions could _ not _ be matched to the ising fixed - point function so successfully .",
    "these observations might well have been anticipated since rg theory indicates that both these systems should behave classically,@xmath44 i.e. , display van der waals critical exponents @xmath46.@xmath47 camp and patey then tried to match the computed distribution functions to the approximately known classical fixed - point function@xmath48 but with no success .",
    "they attributed the failure of the matching to lack of a precisely known classical fixed - point function ; but it could well be due to the more singular corrections - to - scaling associated with slowly decaying power - law interactions or to the failure of a fortunate but seemingly accidental cancelation of such corrections found in ising systems as explained below . indeed , even if the fixed point function were accurately known , unresolved questions about the general validity and effectiveness of the bruce - wilding analysis would still remain , especially for fluids whose behavior deviates significantly from particle - hole symmetry such as polymer solutions and `` coulombic '' vs.  `` solvophobic '' electrolytes.@xmath49 these questions will be addressed below .    one significant and potentially serious aspect of the bw approach has come to the fore only recently.@xmath50 this pertains to the presence of a yang - yang anomaly@xmath51 in the bulk critical behavior of the system of interest .",
    "to be explicit , suppose @xmath1 is the chemical potential on the phase boundary at and below @xmath52 : then a yang - yang anomaly is represented by the divergence ( or , more generally , corresponding singular behavior ) of the second derivative , @xmath0 when @xmath53 .",
    "the strength and sign of a yang - yang anomaly is conveniently measured@xmath50 by @xmath54 , the limiting ratio of @xmath55 to the constant - volume specific heat , @xmath56 ( or , more generally , to its singular part ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that although yang - yang anomalies vanish identically by construction in simple fluid models with an underlying gas - liquid ( or ` particle - hole ' ) symmetry , such as the standard lattice - gases in which @xmath1 is always an analytic function through @xmath13 , they must appear in general , as yang and yang@xmath51 argued nearly 40 years ago .",
    "furthermore , both experimental data@xmath57 and unequivocal simulation evidence  for the hard - core square - well ( hcsw ) fluid@xmath58 and the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) electrolyte@xmath59  point to significant nonvanishing magnitudes of the yang - yang ratios @xmath54 ( even though the experimental situation is not yet fully transparent@xmath60 ) .",
    "in addition , an exactly soluble class of `` compressible cell gas '' models explicitly exhibits yang - yang anomalies.@xmath61    but how do such anomalies impact the bw method ?",
    "the answer is that bw specifically failed to allow for the possible mixing of the pressure @xmath62 into the scaling fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 via a term proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "it transpires , however , that this previously neglected feature@xmath64 of a `` full '' scaling theory is essential@xmath50 to account for the presence of a yang - yang anomaly in the bulk critical behavior .",
    "accordingly , one of the aims of the analysis presented below is to investigate how the introduction of pressure mixing , which entails two further , independent mixing coefficients , affects the precision and reliability of the bw method .    to tackle these issues",
    "we will invoke a rather thorough analysis of the full bulk scaling theory that incorporates pressure mixing and is applicable to nonsymmetric systems.@xmath61 then we will appeal to a recent systematic extension of the theory to systems of finite - size.@xmath65 however , even to critique the bw theory in the absence of pressure mixing , it has proved necessary to formulate the bw matching procedures more precisely .",
    "it seems , indeed , that neither concrete details of actual implementations of the bw approach nor an explicit analysis of the relevant finite - size effects are available in the literature .",
    "accordingly , in section iii below , we revisit the bw approach ( without pressure mixing ) from first - principles and describe the essential details in a systematic and explicit manner .    on this basis , but subject to at least one serious proviso , we confirm the principal claims.@xmath16 in particular , the effective _ finite - size critical density _ , @xmath8 , defined by bw approaches @xmath14",
    "like @xmath66 when @xmath5 ( where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are critical exponents for the specific heat and the correlation length@xmath69 ) .",
    "likewise , the corresponding _ effective critical temperature _ , @xmath2 , approaches @xmath13 as @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 is the leading even correction - to - scaling exponent@xmath47 ) .",
    "armed with this information , effective extrapolations to @xmath72 may be undertaken .",
    "in addition to verifying these convergence laws , we obtain the corresponding leading amplitudes of the deviations , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , in terms of parameters that are known or given .    we then ask : does pressure mixing change these results and , if so , how ? can the approach be modified readily to allow for the changes ? in answering these questions , we use the finite - size scaling form for the _ canonical _ free energy , @xmath75 , derived in ref 37 .",
    "we conclude , in fact , that pressure mixing will generate a _ new term _ in @xmath8 varying as @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the coexistence - curve exponent@xmath47 ) that dominates the previously derived @xmath66 term for large @xmath3 . for ising type @xmath33@xmath34@xmath78-dimensional fluids one has @xmath79",
    "while @xmath80 so the difference exponent is only about 0.38.@xmath47    the amplitude of this @xmath81 term is proportional to the coefficient @xmath82 that specifies the degree to which the pressure mixes into the ordering field @xmath26 : see eq 3 below .",
    "thus , when pressure mixing is negligible , i.e. , @xmath82 is sufficiently small , the bw estimation procedure for @xmath14 ( that assumes the asymptotic @xmath66 behavior ) remains reasonable .",
    "however , one should expect the dominant @xmath76 term to play a more significant role in highly asymmetric fluids like the rpm where pressure mixing seems likely to be larger .",
    "furthermore , these two terms may compete which could well yield potentially misleading nonmonotonic behavior . in the case of @xmath2",
    ", our analysis indicates that pressure mixing does not alter the leading @xmath70 term although its amplitude changes if @xmath83 ; however , that does not invalidate the bw approach .",
    "at this point we should point out that to fulfill the need for _ bias - free _ methods of assessing fluid criticality and , in particular , to convincingly determine universality class without prior assumptions , novel approaches have recently been devised , analyzed , and implemented.@xmath84 these techniques rest on the calculation of certain special finite - size loci in the @xmath85 plane , notably the @xmath86-loci@xmath87 and , especially , the @xmath88-loci,@xmath89 @xmath90 , and the examination of various density fluctuation moments as functions of @xmath24 and @xmath3 on these loci . in this way",
    "the ising character of criticality in the rpm electrolyte has been established,@xmath91 and precise and , apparently , rather reliable estimates of @xmath13 and @xmath14 have been found for the model .",
    "however , these new methods require more and more careful computation ! accordingly , for `` every - day '' or exploratory applications where ising behavior may be reasonably presupposed , it is reasonable to ask what kind of error one should expect in applying the convenient and relatively economical bw recipe to estimate the critical points of new model fluids .",
    "indeed , the bw method does seem to give reliable estimates of @xmath13 when the universality class of the model under investigation is of ising character .",
    "some concrete evidence for this conclusion is presented in table 1 , which gives estimates for the hcsw fluid and the rpm .",
    "one sees that for the rather symmetric hcsw fluid ( with a very small yang - yang anomaly,@xmath59 @xmath92 ) the central bw estimate for @xmath13 is only same 1 part in @xmath93 higher than the unbiased value ; indeed , the quoted uncertainties overlap . for the rpm ( with a highly asymmetric coexistence curve and a significant yang - yang anomaly,@xmath59 @xmath94 ) the uncertainties no longer overlap ; but the bw estimate is lower by less than 1 part in @xmath95 . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical densities provided by the bw method and their apparent precision are in much poorer agreement with the new unbiased estimates ; for both models the bw values are higher , by @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "one may suspect that a similar situation will prevail more generally ; but further precise simulations , for example , for polymer solution models , are needed to confirm such a verdict .",
    "the balance of this article is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly recapitulate , for ease of reference and to define notation , the basic scaling theory with pressure mixing.@xmath61 the vital details of the bw method and concrete procedures for matching the distribution functions are formulated in section iii .",
    "the limiting behavior of the basic estimators @xmath8 and @xmath2 is then discussed pointing out the fortunate accident ( noted but not stressed by the original authors ) that seems essential to its practical success .",
    "section iv addresses the modifications of the bw analysis that allow for pressure mixing . in section v a brief summary and discussion is provided .",
    "following refs 30 and 31 we consider a single - component fluid with a critical point at @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath13 and with a critical density @xmath14 .",
    "convenient dimensionless variables near the critical point are then @xmath100 where @xmath101 is boltzmann s constant . neglecting terms beyond linear order@xmath102 the _ nonlinear scaling fields _ , @xmath103 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 may be written @xmath104 where , for future reference we mention that in the bulk or thermodynamic limit the choices in eq 1 leads to @xmath105 while @xmath106 is related to the critical point entropy .",
    "[ see eq 3.22 of ref 30 . ] in these terms a general scaling hypothesis asserts that the thermodynamics near criticality can be described , at least asymptotically , by@xmath102 @xmath107 with @xmath108 corresponding to @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the gap exponent while @xmath67 , @xmath77 and @xmath111 are the standard exponents.@xmath47 as mentioned above , @xmath71 is the leading even correction - to - scaling exponent while @xmath112 is the corresponding leading odd exponent .",
    "the coefficients @xmath88 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are nonuniversal amplitudes while , when suitably normalized,@xmath102 @xmath116 are two branches of a universal scaling function .",
    "the nonuniversal irrelevant scaling amplitudes , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , will , in general , depend smoothly on the variables @xmath31 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 or @xmath103 , @xmath26 and @xmath27.@xmath119 note that the bw assumption corresponds to setting @xmath120 ( which does not , in and of itself , relate to any special symmetry ) ; thus their analysis requires the determination of only the two mixing coefficients @xmath121 and @xmath122 .    in line with the original bw analysis , it is appropriate to define two relevant critical densities or `` operators , '' @xmath123 and @xmath124 , conjugate to the ordering field @xmath26 and the thermal scaling field @xmath27 in the underlying hamiltonian . in the context of an ising ferromagnet",
    "these may be identified as the fluctuating magnetization and the fluctuating energy density ( or , more precisely , as the deviations from the respective mean values at criticality ) .",
    "thus we may obtain the mean values of these basic scaling densities via @xmath125 where the subscripts denote mean values evaluated at criticality .",
    "( note that in the previous analysis@xmath126 the notation adopted was @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we may also define the thermodynamic reduced number density @xmath129 and energy density @xmath130 via@xmath102 @xmath131 these are related to the number density , @xmath132 , and the total entropy , @xmath133 , by @xmath134 where , as previously , @xmath135 is the number of particles in the system and @xmath136 the volume .",
    "now the relevant critical densities , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , can be expressed as _ nonlinear combinations _ of the reduced energy and number densities : after some algebra one finds@xmath102 @xmath139 where the constant @xmath140 reduces to @xmath141 in the absence of pressure mixing . note that even though the relevant scaling fields are considered only up to linear order , the presence of the _ linear _ pressure - mixing makes the mean order - parameter @xmath142 and critical energy density @xmath143 _ nonlinear _ combinations of the number density @xmath129 and the energy density @xmath130 .",
    "this is in contrast to the linear forms assumed by bw for @xmath123 and @xmath124 in terms of the fluctuating number and energy densities:@xmath16 however , in the absence of pressure mixing ( i.e. , when @xmath120 ) the two mean densities reduce to @xmath144 in accord with the bw formulation .    even in the presence of pressure - mixing",

    "\\langle\\delta { \\cal e}\\rangle & \\approx & k^{-1}[(1-j_{2}l_{0})\\delta \\check{u } - ( k_{1}+j_{2}k_{0})\\delta\\check{\\rho } ] .",
    "\\label{ch5-eq5.13 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these forms are consistent with the expressions given by bw except for the modification of the coefficients by the pressure - mixing coefficients @xmath146 and @xmath82 .      to discuss the analysis of simulation data we need an appropriate , `` complete '' finite - size scaling formulation .",
    "to that end we follow ref 37 and first introduce the dimensionless size - scaled temperature and ordering field variables @xmath147 and the leading even and odd correction variables @xmath148 here @xmath68 is the correlation length exponent while @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 are nonuniversal metrical factors ( depending only weakly on @xmath62 , @xmath25 , @xmath24 and @xmath3 ) of dimensions conjugate to the powers of @xmath3 appearing in the definitions of @xmath153 , etc .",
    "the basic scaling hypothesis eq 5 is then extended to @xmath154 see eq 2.2 of ref 37.@xmath155 apart from possible @xmath3-dependences of the scaling field@xmath65 @xmath103 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which , however , have no effects to the orders that will be relevant here,@xmath65 the definitions in eqs 2 , 3 , and 4 still hold .",
    "the scaling function @xmath156 should be universal ( when suitably normalized ) but _ must _ depend on the boundary conditions and , indeed , on the shape of the system domain . accordingly , for concreteness we will presuppose cubic simulation boxes of edge length @xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "since in a finite system the grand canonical pressure must be related analytically to the other fields , the scaling function @xmath157 should be analytic for small values of all its arguments.@xmath65    the bulk limit may now be obtained formally by setting @xmath158 and letting @xmath5 .",
    "the form of eq 5 is then recaptured provided the _ hyperscaling relation _",

    "now bw focus on the joint distribution function , @xmath166 , of the critical densities @xmath123 and @xmath124 and suppose this has an appropriate universal scaling form . without doubt the mean values , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , in a finite system will still be given by the previous thermodynamic first derivatives  see eq 6  provided @xmath103 is replaced by the finite - size expression eq 17 for @xmath169.@xmath65 however , the mean values clearly do _ not _ define the distribution function @xmath166 .",
    "on the other hand , from the successive derivatives @xmath170 one can extract , in a standard way , the corresponding moments @xmath171 for all @xmath172 as functions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( or , equivalently , as functions of @xmath62 , @xmath25 , and @xmath24 ) .",
    "then , from the full set of moments one may , at least in principle , reconstruct the corresponding distribution function that is desired.@xmath173 furthermore , it is clear that all the scaling properties of the set of moments will be inherited by the distribution function .    if we introduce the scaled number and energy fluctuation variables via @xmath174 it follows that we may conclude @xmath175 where the normalization constant @xmath176 can play no special role .",
    "apart from notation and the neglect of the leading odd correction variable @xmath177 , this is precisely the finite - size scaling ansatz advanced by wilding.@xmath178 ( of course we ourselves have , here and above , neglected all higher order correction variables @xmath179 for @xmath180.@xmath181 ) it is also clear that the scaling function @xmath182 should be universal . at bulk",
    "criticality , where @xmath183 , so that @xmath184 , we can then write @xmath185 where @xmath186 embodies the universal , statistically scale - invariant critical density fluctuations characteristic of a specific universality class but also incorporates the leading inverse powers of @xmath3 that must play a significant role in systems that are not very large .",
    "the aim of the bw method is to match the observed fluctuation data for the particle number density , @xmath187 , and energy density , @xmath188 , to the expected near - critical ordering density distribution , that follows from @xmath189 on the basis of the scaling ansatz eq 20 , and likewise to the corresponding critical energy density distribution , @xmath190 . in essence the matching is to be accomplished ( i ) by suitably choosing the two mixing parameters @xmath122 and @xmath121 in the expressions @xmath191 ( that underlie eq 12 for the mean values ) and ( ii ) by determining @xmath3-dependent approximations , @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath192 , for the bulk values @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath193 .",

    "a priori_. indeed , fluid - magnet universality implies that a critical fluid order parameter distribution , @xmath199 , should , when @xmath5 , precisely match the universal function @xmath195 appropriate to the ising universality class ; but this can be found independently by careful monte carlo simulations of ising models.@xmath200 figure 1 shows this distribution as obtained by wilding and mller@xmath201 via simulations of the @xmath33@xmath34@xmath78-dimensional ising model .",
    "the distribution function has been normalized to unit integrated weight while the nonuniversal amplitude @xmath150 is chosen so that the distribution has unit variance .",

    "the finite - size ordering distribution , @xmath210 , can be obtained computationally by transforming the joint distribution @xmath211 as observed in a simulation ( where here we regard @xmath129 and @xmath130 as the _ fluctuating _ finite - size values of density and energy ) , by using eqs 21 and 22 , while simultaneously transforming the chemical potential @xmath25 and the temperature @xmath24 by introducing the ( as yet unknown ) mixing coefficient @xmath122 . as indicated , when @xmath5 , the resulting function , @xmath210 , should match the universal distribution @xmath212 in terms of the variable @xmath213 using the ( known ) critical exponents @xmath77 and @xmath68 for the universality class in question , matching @xmath210 to the universal function @xmath212 at some fixed @xmath3 is to be implemented by choosing five fitting parameters , which , following bw , we take as the estimators @xmath2 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 since , when @xmath218 , these should approach the corresponding bulk values .",
    "wilding has given no details of how he actually performs the matching that he implements:@xmath219 this leaves some ambiguity when it comes to estimating finite - size corrections and studying the effects of pressure mixing .",
    "accordingly , for precision we consider the following formal procedure : * ( a ) * at finite @xmath3 and fixed @xmath220 [ and for values of @xmath25 not too far from @xmath1 ] the measured distribution @xmath210 will normally be two - peaked . by adjusting @xmath25 to , say ,",

    "we also remark that if pressure mixing is absent , i.e. , @xmath120 , the fitting values @xmath8 and @xmath192 may also be determined by using eq 12 .",
    "notice then that the mixing parameters , @xmath240 , and @xmath241 are simply equal to @xmath242 and @xmath243 , respectively , as follows from the scaling analysis.@xmath244      to elucidate the @xmath3-dependence of the estimators @xmath2 , @xmath8 , etc .",

    "the original bw approach assumed tacitly that throughout the matching procedure @xmath252 is maintained ; it also ignored the odd correction - to - scaling contribution . in this case , the order distribution @xmath210 becomes symmetric about @xmath253 .",

    "the consequent presence of an _ antisymmetric _ contribution to @xmath210 , which varies as @xmath259 then makes it more difficult to match the order distribution to the _ symmetric _ fixed point function for @xmath3 not so large .",

    ".    nevertheless , in order to elucidate the original bw method , let us initially ignore the contributions in eq 28 proportional to @xmath260 and @xmath261 that arise from the nonzero value of @xmath26 and the odd corrections - to - scaling .",
    "in that case , the order distribution @xmath210 should be symmetric in @xmath123 about the critical value @xmath262 .",
    "but then the rather precise collapse of @xmath210 onto the fixed point function @xmath263 that has been achieved in practical simulations seems to require the _ effective cancelation _ of the contributions from the finite non - zero value of the scaling field @xmath27 by the leading even correction - to - scaling term : see the second and third terms in eq 28 .",
    "indeed , as noted by wilding , nicolaides and bruce@xmath264 the functional forms of the universal functions @xmath247 and @xmath248 do seem to be similar in the ising universality class , so that such a cancelation is feasible !",
    "however , this seems to be no more than a fortunate accident with only limited numerical support ; no firm evidence as to why this should be true or should hold for other universality classes has been offered",
    ". nevertheless , if one accepts this observation as a reasonable approximation , the cancelation of the two contributions yields @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the ( approximately ) @xmath197-independent ratio of @xmath267 .",
    "the condition @xmath268 , which was accepted in the original bw method , leads via the scaling field definition eq 3 , to @xmath269 where we are , here , neglecting @xmath82 . substituting and using eq 4 ( with @xmath270 )",
    "leads to @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the true critical temperature .",
    "the exponent @xmath273 here confirms the arguments of wilding , nicolaides and bruce.@xmath264 for a nonzero value of @xmath121 , it also follows that the chemical potential estimator scales in the same way as @xmath2 .",
    "we thus obtain explicitly @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the bulk critical chemical potential .",
    "finally , recognizing eq 29 for @xmath276 , turns out not to change the leading behavior in the temperature and chemical potential estimators , since , at least for @xmath33@xmath34@xmath78-dimensional ising - type systems , we have @xmath277 .",
    "but it must be emphasized again that this conclusion relies upon the surely approximate proportionality of @xmath247 to @xmath248 .      to study estimators for the true critical density , @xmath14 ( @xmath278 ) , and energy density , @xmath193 ( @xmath279 )",
    ", we consider the following equations derived by inverting eq 12 , namely , @xmath280 in order to obtain @xmath242 and @xmath281 we must thus first determine the behavior of @xmath217 and @xmath235 .",
    "wilding and mller@xmath282 argued that the critical value of the ordering operator , namely , @xmath217 , should not depend on the system size @xmath3 , since the asymptotic order distribution @xmath210 will be symmetric in @xmath283 which fixes @xmath262 .",
    "however , this can not be strictly true if one recognizes the contributions from the nonzero value of @xmath26 and the leading odd correction - to - scaling term .",
    "as mentioned , these contributions , proportional to @xmath250 and @xmath251 , respectively , are antisymmetric in @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , for any finite @xmath3 , a perfect collapse of @xmath210 onto the symmetric , fixed point distribution @xmath245 is not , in general , possible .",
    "nevertheless , let us suppose that an optimal collapse of data has been achieved ( say , by some least - squares procedure ) yielding a best fit for the various estimators .",
    "how does @xmath217 then depend on @xmath3 ?    the near - critical order distribution @xmath210 will have a local minimum at @xmath284 in accord with the matching requirements . in the absence of @xmath250 and @xmath251 ( and any higher order odd terms",
    ") , this value should coincide with the limiting value @xmath285  which merely says that @xmath210 has a local minimum at @xmath286 .",
    "however , the antisymmetric corrections , @xmath250 and @xmath251 must shift @xmath217 away from @xmath262 so that @xmath210 will have a local minimum at some @xmath287 . to find this location ,",
    "we expand the scaling functions in eq 28 about @xmath288 : according to their symmetries one may write @xmath289 and similarly for @xmath290 , while @xmath260 and @xmath261 generate only odd powers of @xmath197 . at the minimum ,",
    "the derivative of @xmath210 , which takes the form @xmath291 must vanish .",
    "( note that we have used eq 29 . ) on the other hand , the magnitude matching relation eq 26 yields the further condition @xmath292 solving these two conditions simultaneously for @xmath197 and @xmath27 yields @xmath293 we may then note from the definition of @xmath266 in eq 30 , that the @xmath294 ratio in the amplitude for @xmath27 is simply @xmath295 . from eqs 23 and 38 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath296 where @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "in contrast to the arguments of wilding and mller,@xmath282 we thus find that @xmath217 _ does _ depend on @xmath3 with a leading exponent @xmath299 that , for ising - type systems , is approximately @xmath300.@xmath47    to obtain the @xmath3-dependence of the energy estimator @xmath235 , we first recall that the energy distribution @xmath301 is asymmetric with a maximum at @xmath302 : see fig .  2 . the matching of @xmath190 to @xmath301 then yields @xmath303 finally , from eq 33 we obtain @xmath304 notice that the leading exponent @xmath305 agrees with the assertions of refs 6 and 7 so that the dependence of @xmath217 ( contrary to the related claims@xmath282 ) does not actually disturb the anticipated asymptotic behavior .",
    "this completes our analysis of the bw approach when pressure mixing may be neglected .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , it is important in studying asymmetric fluid criticality to understand and , if possible , to allow for the effects of pressure mixing in the bw approach . in ref 37 a scaling expression for the bulk canonical free energy density , @xmath75 , that incorporates pressure mixing",
    "is derived . on this basis a finite - size scaling form for the singular part of the canonical free energy density @xmath306 was advanced .",
    "a crucial feature is that pressure mixing introduces an extra correction term that vanishes as @xmath307 when @xmath218 .",
    "this contribution turns out to be antisymmetric in the ordering operator @xmath308 . on noticing that @xmath309 $ ] becomes closely related to @xmath75 when @xmath5",
    ", we see that the scaling ansatz for the order distribution @xmath210 postulated by bw@xmath16 should better be modified to read , in expanded form [ compare with eq 28 ] @xmath310 ,   \\label{ch5-eq5.43 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the new , i.e. , the third term entails the scaling function @xmath311 which should be universal and antisymmetric in @xmath197 while the amplitude , @xmath312 , is nonuniversal . in fact",
    ", this new contribution dominates all subsequent corrections when the exponents take ising or similar values ( where we appeal to eq 29 to see that @xmath313 ) .",
    "the presence of this pressure mixing term evidently raises a further question about the validity of the bw method .",
    "when @xmath82 is small , one may well still obtain good matching of the observed distribution @xmath210 to the symmetric fixed point function @xmath245 even for relatively small system sizes .",
    "the 2d lennard - jones fluid may represent such a case , since wilding@xmath178 observed that @xmath210 could be well symmetrized and readily matched to @xmath245 .",
    "however , if @xmath82 is sufficiently large , one should not ignore its contribution : then symmetrization of @xmath210 should be feasible only in an approximate way even for relatively large @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , caillol , levesque and weis@xmath314 performed monte carlo simulations on equicharged hard - spheres ( i.e. , the rpm electrolyte ) and observed that their data for @xmath210 could be matched to the ising distribution @xmath245 only for large @xmath3 ; for small @xmath3 they were unable to symmetrize via the bw procedure .",
    "they attributed this failure to poor data sampling in the low density region of their smaller systems ; but it would seem that significant pressure mixing in the model@xmath59 could well be the primary cause of the observed asymmetry although the antisymmetric contribution due to @xmath26 , which varies like @xmath315 [ see eq 29 ] , may also be a factor .",
    "further simulations to resolve these possibilities would , thus , be interesting .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath199 should always asymptotically approach @xmath245 when @xmath218 . in practice therefore , one may still be able to match @xmath210 to @xmath245 within tolerable precision for large enough @xmath3 and thence derive best - fit estimators via the bw recipe",
    ". how will these then depend on the system size @xmath3 ?    before addressing this question , we will revisit the matching conditions described in section iii.1 .",
    "as demonstrated by eqs 9 and 10 , we must expect the critical ordering and energy densities , @xmath316 and @xmath317 , to actually be _ nonlinear _ combinations of the density and energy fluctuations , @xmath318 and @xmath188 . near enough to the critical point , when the typical deviations are small",
    ", however , linear bw relations , following eqs 13 and 14 , should still become valid .",
    "but we expect such linear relations to be inadequate further from criticality .    even if one can reach regimes where the linear relations are valid , however , the matching procedure should be more complicated , in order to accommodate the two extra unknown parameters , @xmath146 and @xmath82 . here",
    "we propose an approach which , as far as possible , adopts the steps presented previously in section iii.1 : * ( i ) * first suppose @xmath120 and proceed through steps * ( a)*-*(c ) * in order to match the data for @xmath210 as well as feasible to @xmath245 and so obtain the first round of estimators @xmath319 , @xmath320 , @xmath321 , @xmath322 , and @xmath323 . the remaining parameters , @xmath324 , @xmath325 and @xmath326 can be obtained similarly by matching the energy operator distribution @xmath190 to the fixed point distribution @xmath301 as explained before .",
    "we should also recall the relations @xmath327 and @xmath328 . at this stage , however , one may still observe differences between the mixed data distributions and the fixed point distributions , especially further from criticality . * ( ii ) * knowing via eq 43 that @xmath82 relates to asymmetry in @xmath210 , we now suppose , as a tentative approximation , that the fluctuating critical densities , @xmath316 and @xmath317 , are related to the observable fluctuations , @xmath187 and @xmath329 , via _ nonlinear relations _ that parallel eqs 9 and 10 ( i.e. , obtained by removing the expectation brackets and replacing the @xmath330 s by @xmath331 s ) . then , on first retaining the setting @xmath270 , one can attempt to adjust @xmath82 to obtain a value , say @xmath332 , that provides a better match of @xmath210 to @xmath245 .",
    "next * ( iii ) * one may adjust @xmath146 in the nonlinear relations to improve the matching of @xmath190 to @xmath301 : this should yield a value @xmath333 . *",
    "( iv ) * now one can set @xmath334 and @xmath335 and recalculate the order distribution @xmath210 : one is likely to observe some new discrepancies near the local minimum and the two maxima .",
    "accordingly , one can return to step * ( i ) * but now with fixed @xmath334 and @xmath335 , and iterate the procedure to find a new set of parameters , say @xmath336 , @xmath337 , etc .",
    "on repeating these steps , one should be led to stable values for all the parameters .",
    "nevertheless , as a practical matter one may reasonably question the robustness of this procedure ( which we have _ not _ ourselves attempted to implement ) .    to obtain an assessment of the effect of pressure mixing on the convergence of the bw procedure , however , it suffices to suppose that we have achieved a good matching for the distribution functions @xmath210 and @xmath190 and have in hand a satisfactory fit of the critical parameters . to understand the @xmath3-dependence , we first expand the new universal function @xmath311 in eq 43 as @xmath338 while the other functions appearing in eq 43 may be expanded just as in sec .",
    "iii.3 : see eq 34 .",
    "the local minimum of @xmath210 must then satisfy @xmath339 while the matching condition , @xmath340 , yields a further condition corresponding to eq 36 , namely , @xmath341 solving these two equations simultaneously for @xmath197 and @xmath27 yields @xmath342 while , as regards the leading term , @xmath27 is still given by eq 37 .",
    "note that the @xmath343 term , that originally appeared in eq 38 ( when @xmath120 ) still arises but only as a higher order correction not displayed here .",
    "[ as previously , we assume tacitly that the exponent values lie within the normal range of @xmath344 fixed points . ]    to derive the modified form for @xmath2 , we first rewrite eq 2 , the definition for @xmath103 , in the form @xmath345 on using eq 3 , the definition of @xmath26 , similarly , the result in eq 29 then yields @xmath346 which , on substitution , gives the leading order result @xmath347 from which we have dropped the terms varying as @xmath348 ( see ref 37 ) and @xmath349 which enter only as higher order corrections",
    ". we may now substitute these results into eq 37 and use eq 4 for @xmath27 to find @xmath350 where the mixing coefficient combination is @xmath351 while @xmath352 as in eq 38 .",
    "the chemical potential may be obtained by substitution in eq 49 which yields @xmath353 note that pressure mixing does not alter the leading exponent but does change the amplitude .",
    "finally , the critical order estimator @xmath217 can be obtained from eq 47 which leads to the replacement of eq 39 by @xmath354 where @xmath355 and @xmath356 , while @xmath357 is given after eq 39 . on the other hand , to leading order , eq 40 remains valid for the energy estimator , @xmath235 . to complete the calculation we now invert eqs 9 and 10 to obtain , up to linear order , @xmath358 appealing to eqs 40 and 54 then yields our main conclusions , namely , @xmath359 where the coefficients are @xmath360 when the pressure - mixing coefficient @xmath82 vanishes , the leading @xmath81 terms drop out but the @xmath10 terms remain ; in that case one regains the original bw exponents for @xmath8 and @xmath192 although the amplitudes now depend on @xmath146 .",
    "evidently pressure mixing may significantly slow the rate of convergence in estimating @xmath14 and @xmath193 . in practice",
    "it may be more significant that the exponents @xmath79 , @xmath361 , and @xmath362 ( using ising values ) are fairly close in magnitude so that if the successive terms are of different sign and thus compete , reliable extrapolation may be seriously hampered",
    ". this could be the cause of the misleading bw error estimate for @xmath14 seen in table 1 for the rpm .",
    "in summary we have examined critically the bruce - wilding extrapolation method that , in the past , has been widely applied to various model systems since it usually provides a straightforward and apparently reliable way of estimating critical parameters from finite - size data .",
    "we first analyzed in some detail the original bw method , that neglects pressure mixing in the scaling fields .",
    "effective critical parameter estimators , @xmath2 , @xmath8 , etc .",
    ", can be obtained by matching the numerically measured distribution functions @xmath210 and @xmath190 to the fixed point functions @xmath245 and @xmath301 , respectively .",
    "we provided a precise specification for implementing the matching procedure that generates satisfactory fits and yields explicit values for the critical parameter estimators that can be investigated analytically .",
    "the finite - size behavior of the estimators , @xmath2 , @xmath8 , etc .",
    ", was then derived .",
    "the principal bw claims , namely , that @xmath73 and @xmath363 decay like @xmath70 when @xmath5 while @xmath74 and @xmath364 vanish as @xmath66 were confirmed with explicit expressions for the amplitudes : see eqs 31 , 32 , 41 , and 42 .",
    "when pressure mixing is allowed for , however , the ordering operator distribution , @xmath210 , contains extra _ antisymmetric _ corrections that vanish only as @xmath365 ; as a result these dominate all other corrections to scaling .",
    "consequently , the matching of @xmath210 to the symmetric fixed point function @xmath245 can be achieved only in an approximate way for finite @xmath3 if one follows the bw recipe .",
    "an extension of the bw procedure that makes some allowance for pressure mixing was proposed but has not been tested .",
    "nevertheless , by assuming that an acceptable matching can be realized , we demonstrated that pressure mixing does not alter the leading @xmath70 term in the effective critical temperature , @xmath2 : see eq 51 ( although the amplitude is changed ) . on the other hand , the effective critical ( number ) density , @xmath8 , and energy density , @xmath192 ,",
    "contain new , @xmath76 , terms with amplitudes proportional to the pressure - mixing coefficient @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , these terms asymptotically dominate those previously identified : see eqs 57 and 58 .    in conclusion , the bruce - wilding method may still be regarded as a useful practical guide to the extrapolation of finite - size simulation data for systems that do not deviate far from symmetry and that may with confidence be expected to fall within the ising critical universality class : see table 1 for some indications of its precision and numerical short comings . in other cases , however , the first issue of concern is that one lacks numerically reliable universal fixed - point distributions for the order parameter and energy that are essential for the method . indeed , as outlined in the introduction , camp and patey@xmath38 implemented the bw method in a study of liquid - gas criticality in model fluids with algebraically decaying attractive pair interactions , and encountered just this problem ! nevertheless , even if the required universal distributions were accurately known , one could not reasonably expect to benefit from the fortunate but apparently quite accidental cancelation of the thermal and leading even - correction scaling functions which have greatly assisted practical bw calculations for ising systems : see the discussion in association with eq 30 ( where the ratio @xmath266 was introduced ) .    beyond that ,",
    "even when ising criticality may be confidently assumed , the presence of _ both _ odd - order correction terms _ and _ significant pressure mixing , must be expected if , as in the case of the hard - sphere ionic fluid models,@xmath366 the observed asymmetries are not small . in such cases , even when the bw matching recipe can be implemented satisfactorily , the results will very likely be distorted ( relative to the more symmetric cases ) ; consequently , the subsequent extrapolations must be regarded with increased caution and assessed as less reliable : see table 1 .",
    "while we have sketched one iterative bw - type method that could allow for pressure mixing , one might consider further elaborations of the bw approach  for example , by directly examining and `` tuning out '' the scaled _ cross correlations _ of the number density , @xmath367 , and the configurational energy density , @xmath20 .",
    "however , in the light of the recently developed bias - free procedures , involving the @xmath88-loci and related estimators@xmath368 ( which seem to work rather reliably for at least some highly asymmetric systems and do _ not _ require detailed prior knowledge ) , attempts to further extend the bw approach do not seem warranted at present .",

    "<S> is set out thereby revealing clearly a fortunate , close cancelation of contributions from the leading correction - to - scaling and thermal scaling functions that makes the method effective for ising - type systems but which lacks a general theoretical basis . </S>",
    "<S> the bw approach does not allow for pressure mixing in the scaling fields which is essential for representing a yang - yang anomaly , namely , the divergence at criticality of the second temperature derivative , @xmath0 , of the chemical potential @xmath1 on the phase boundary ; but such behavior must be expected in realistic models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that allowance for pressure mixing does not alter the leading dependence of the critical temperature estimator , @xmath2 , on the linear size , @xmath3 , of the simulation box : this converges as @xmath4 when @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the correlation - length and leading correction critical exponents ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the critical density estimator , @xmath8 , gains a leading variation @xmath9 that dominates the previously claimed @xmath10 term ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the specific heat and coexistence curve exponents ) . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , the bw method provides estimates of @xmath13 consistent with those obtained from recently developed _ </S>",
    "<S> unbiased _ techniques that do _ not _ require prior knowledge of the universal order - parameter and energy distribution functions ; however , bw estimates of the critical densities , @xmath14 , prove significantly less reliable . </S>"
