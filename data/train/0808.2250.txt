    "our current state of knowledge about how stars and planets are formed comes from an intertwined web of observations ( spanning the electromagnetic spectrum ) and theoretical work .",
    "the early stages of low - mass star formation comprise a wide array of inferred physical processes , including disk accretion , various kinds of outflow , and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) activity on time scales ranging from hours to millennia ( see , e.g. , lada 1985 ; bertout 1989 ; appenzeller & mundt 1989 ; hartmann 2000 ; knigl & pudritz 2000 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ; shu et al .   2007 ) .",
    "a key recurring issue is that there is a great deal of _ mutual interaction and feedback _ between the star and its circumstellar environment .",
    "this interaction can determine how rapidly the star rotates , how active the star appears from radio to x - ray wavelengths , and how much mass and energy the star releases into its interplanetary medium .",
    "a key example of circumstellar feedback is the magnetospheric accretion paradigm for classical t tauri stars ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ; uchida & shibata 1984 ; camenzind 1990 ; knigl 1991 ) . because of strong ( @xmath01 kg ) stellar magnetic fields",
    ", the evolving equatorial accretion disk does not penetrate to the stellar surface , but instead is stopped by the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "accretion is thought to proceed via ballistic infall along magnetic flux tubes threading the inner disk , leading to shocks and hot spots on the surface .",
    "the primordial accretion disk is dissipated gradually as the star enters the weak - lined t tauri star phase , with a likely transition to a protoplanetary dust / debris disk .    throughout these stages ,",
    "solar - mass stars are inferred to exhibit some kind of wind or jet - like outflow .",
    "there are several possible explanations of how and where the outflows arise , including extended disk winds , x - winds , impulsive ( plasmoid - like ) ejections , and `` true '' stellar winds ( e.g. , paatz & camenzind 1996 ; calvet 1997 ; knigl & pudritz 2000 ; dupree et al .",
    "2005 ; edwards et al .   2006 ; ferreira et al .   2006 ;",
    "gmez de castro & verdugo 2007 ; cai et al .",
    "whatever their origin , the outflows produce observational diagnostics that indicate mass loss rates exceeding the sun s present mass loss rate by factors of @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "it is of some interest to evaluate how much of the observed outflow can be explained solely with _ stellar _ winds , since these flows are locked to the star and thus are capable of removing angular momentum from the system .",
    "recent work by matt & pudritz ( 2005 , 2007 , 2008 ) has suggested that if there is a stellar wind with a sustained mass loss rate about 10% of the accretion rate , the wind can carry away enough angular momentum to keep t tauri stars from being spun up unrealistically by the accretion .    despite many years of study ,",
    "the dominant physical processes that accelerate winds from cool stars have not yet been identified conclusively . for many stars , the large - scale energetics of the system  i.e . , the luminosity and the gravitational potential  seem to determine the overall magnitude of the mass loss ( reimers 1975 ; 1977 ; schrder & cuntz 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , for the most luminous cool stars , radiation pressure seems to provide a direct causal link between the luminosity @xmath3 and the mass loss rate @xmath4 ( e.g. , gail & sedlmayr 1987 ; hfner 2005 ) .",
    "however , for young solar - mass stars , other mediating processes ( such as coronal heating , waves , or time - variable magnetic ejections ) are more likely to connect the properties of the stellar interior to the surrounding outflowing wind .",
    "for example ,",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves have been studied for several decades as a likely way for energy to be transferred from late - type stars to their winds ( hartmann & macgregor 1980 ; decampli 1981 ; airapetian et al .",
    "2000 ; falceta - gonalves et al .   2006",
    "; suzuki 2007 ) .    in parallel with the above work in improving our understanding of stellar winds , there has been a great deal of progress toward identifying and characterizing the processes that produce the _ sun s _ corona and wind .",
    "it seems increasingly clear that closed magnetic loops in the low solar corona are heated by small - scale , intermittent magnetic reconnection that is driven by the continual stressing of their footpoints by convective motions ( e.g. , aschwanden 2006 ; klimchuk 2006 ) .",
    "the open field lines that connect the sun to interplanetary space , though , appear to be energized by the dissipation of waves and turbulent motions that originate at the stellar surface ( tu & marsch 1995 ; cranmer 2002 ; suzuki 2006 ; kohl et al .",
    "parker s ( 1958 ) classic paradigm of solar wind acceleration via gas pressure in a hot ( @xmath5 k ) corona still seems to be the dominant mechanism , though waves and turbulence have an impact as well .",
    "a recent self - consistent model of turbulence - driven coronal heating and solar wind acceleration has succeeded in reproducing a wide range of observations _ with no ad - hoc free parameters _",
    "( cranmer et al .   2007 ) .",
    "this progress on the solar front is a fruitful jumping - off point for a better understanding of the basic physics of winds and accretion in young stars .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "  2 presents an overview of the general scenario of accretion - driven mhd waves that is proposed here to be important for driving t tauri mass loss . in ",
    "3 the detailed properties of an evolving solar - mass star are presented , including the fundamental stellar parameters , the accretion rate and disk geometry , and the properties of the clumped gas in the magnetospheric accretion streams .",
    "these clumped streams impact the stellar surface and create mhd waves that propagate horizontally to the launching points of stellar wind streams .",
    "  4 describes how self - consistent models of these wind regions are implemented , and   5 gives the results . finally , ",
    "6 contains a summary of the major results of this paper and a discussion of the implications these results may have on our wider understanding of low - mass star formation .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the proposed connection between accretion and stellar wind driving that is explored below .",
    "the models make use of the idea that magnetospheric accretion streams are likely to be highly unstable and time - variable , and thus much of the material deposited onto the star is expected to be in the form of intermittent dense clumps .",
    "the impact of each clump is likely to generate mhd waves on the stellar surface ( scheurwater & kuijpers 1988 ) and these waves can propagate across the surface , spread out the kinetic energy of accretion , and inject some of it into the global magnetic field .",
    "the models simulate the time - steady properties of the polar magnetic flux tubes , wherein the source of wave / turbulence energy at the photosphere comes from two sources : ( 1 ) accretion - driven waves that have propagated over the surface from the `` hot spots , '' and ( 2 ) the ever - present sub - photospheric convection , which shakes the magnetic field lines even without accretion , and is the dominant source of waves for the present - day sun .",
    "there is substantial observational evidence that the accretion streams of classical t tauri stars are clumped and inhomogeneous ( see , e.g. , gullbring et al .",
    "1996 ; safier 1998 ; bouvier et al .   2003 , 2004 , 2007 ; stempels 2003 ) .",
    "strong variations in the accretion signatures take place over time scales ranging between a few hours ( i.e. , the free - fall time from the inner edge of the disk to the star ) and a few days ( i.e. , the stellar rotation period ) . some of this variability may arise from instabilities in the accretion shock ( chevalier & imamura 1982 ; mignone 2005 ) , with the possibility of transitions between stable and unstable periods of accretion ( e.g. , romanova et al .",
    "observations of the bases of accretion streams indicate the presence of turbulence ( johns & basri 1995 ) as well as discrete events that could signal the presence of magnetic reconnection ( giardino et al .",
    "alternately , some of the observed variability may come from larger - scale instabilities in the torqued magnetic field that is threaded by the disk ( e.g. , long et al .   2007 ; kulkarni & romanova 2008 ) and which could also drive periodic reconnection events ( van ballegooijen 1994 ) .",
    "the latter variations would not necessarily be limited to the rotation time scale , since `` instantaneous '' topology changes can happen much more rapidly .",
    "the mechanisms by which impulsive accretion events ( i.e. , impacts of dense clumps ) can create mhd waves on the stellar surface are described in more detail in   3.4 .",
    "this paper uses the analytic results of scheurwater & kuijpers ( 1988 ) to set the energy flux in these waves , based on the available kinetic energy in the impacts .",
    "it is useful to point out , however , that there are relatively well - observed examples of impulse - generated waves on the sun that help to justify the overall plausibility of this scenario .",
    "these are the so - called `` moreton waves '' and `` eit waves '' that are driven by solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "moreton waves are localized ripples seen in the h@xmath6 chromosphere expanding out from strong flares and erupting filaments at speeds of 500 to 2000 km s@xmath7 ( moreton & ramsey 1960 ) .",
    "these seem to be consistent with fast - mode mhd shocks associated with the flaring regions ( e.g. , uchida 1968 ; balasubramaniam et al .",
    "2007 ) . a separate phenomenon , discovered more recently in the extreme ultraviolet and called eit waves ( thompson et al .   1998 ) , is still not yet well understood .",
    "these waves propagate more slowly than moreton waves ( typically 100 to 400 km s@xmath7 ) , but they are often seen to traverse the entire diameter of the sun and remain coherent .",
    "explanations include fast - mode mhd waves ( wang 2000 ) , solitons ( wills - davey et al .",
    "2007 ) , and sheared current layers containing enhanced joule heating ( delanne et al .   2008 ) .",
    "these serve as ample evidence that impulsive phenomena can generate mhd fluctuations that travel across a stellar surface .    finally , it is important to clarify some of the limitations of the modeling approach used in this paper .",
    "the models include only a description of the magnetospheric accretion streams ( with an assumed dipole geometry ) and the open flux tubes at the north and south poles of the star .",
    "thus , there is no attempt to model either disk winds or the closed - field parts of the stellar corona , despite the fact that these are likely to contribute to many key observational diagnostics of t tauri circumstellar gas .",
    "in addition , the accretion streams themselves are included only for their net dynamical impact on the polar ( non - accreting ) regions , and thus there is no need to describe , e.g. , the temperature or ionization state inside the streams .",
    "the wind acceleration in the polar flux tubes is treated with a one - fluid , time - steady approximation similar to that described by cranmer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the solar wind . to summarize , this paper is a `` proof of concept '' study to evaluate how much about t tauri outflows can be explained with _ only _ polar stellar winds that are energized by accretion - driven waves .",
    "to begin exploring how accretion - driven waves affect the winds of young stars , a representative evolutionary sequence of fundamental parameters was constructed for a solar - type star .",
    "the adopted parameters are not intended to reproduce any specific observation in detail and should be considered illustrative .",
    "the stars evolution code http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath0stars/ ] ( eggleton 1971 , 1972 , 1973 ; eggleton et al .   1973 ;",
    "han et al .   1994 ; pols et al .",
    "1995 ) was used to evolve a star having a constant mass @xmath8 from the hayashi track to well past the current age of the sun . neither mass accretion nor mass loss",
    "were included in the evolutionary calculation , and a standard solar abundance mixture ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) was assumed .",
    "all other adjustable parameters of the code were held fixed at their default values .",
    "figure 2 presents a summary of the modeled stellar parameters .",
    "a hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram is shown in figure 2_a _ , with the bolometric luminosity @xmath3 plotted as a function of the effective temperature @xmath11 for both the evolutionary model ( with a subset of stellar ages @xmath12 indicated by symbols ) and an approximate main sequence band for luminosity class v stars ( de jager & nieuwenhuijzen 1987 ) .",
    "the current age of the sun is denoted by @xmath13 yr , or @xmath14 .",
    "figure 2_b _ shows the age dependence of a selection of relevant length scales , including the stellar radius @xmath15 and the photospheric pressure scale height @xmath16 .",
    "the latter quantity is defined assuming a pure hydrogen gas , as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath19 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , and @xmath20 is the newtonian gravitation constant .",
    "note that for most of the applications below , only the relative variation of @xmath16 with age is needed and not its absolute value .",
    "the scale height is assumed to be proportional to the horizontal granulation scale length ( e.g. , robinson et al .",
    "2004 ) , which in turn governs the perpendicular correlation length of alfvnic turbulence in the photosphere ( see   4 ) .",
    "the other major parameter to be specified as a function of age is the mass accretion rate @xmath21 . for classical t tauri stars",
    ", it is generally accepted that the accretion rate decreases with increasing stellar age @xmath12 , but there is a large spread in measured values that may be affected by observational uncertainties in both @xmath21 and @xmath12 . in order to determine a representative age dependence for @xmath22 ,",
    "we utilized tabulated accretion rates from hartigan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and hartmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who interpreted optical / uv continuum excesses as an `` accretion luminosity '' that comes from the kinetic energy of accreted gas impacting the star .",

    "both values have been retained here , and thus figure 3_a _ shows a total of 88 data points from both lists .",
    "the observational uncertainties are not shown ; they may be as large as an order of magnitude in @xmath21 and a factor of @xmath03 in the age ( see , e.g. , figure 3 of muzerolle et al .",

    "( 1998 ) found that the exponent @xmath25 in @xmath26 is most likely to range between about 1.5 and 2.8 , with the lower end of that range being most likely .",
    "thus , the fitted value of @xmath27 above was judged to be too low , and a more realistic fit was performed by fixing @xmath28 and finding @xmath29 which is used in the wind models below and is plotted in figure 3_a_. the scatter around the mean fit curve has a roughly normal distribution ( in the logarithm of @xmath21 ) with a standard deviation ranging between a factor of 6 ( for the 35 solar - mass stars ) to 8 ( for all 88 data points ) on either side of the representative trend given by equation ( [ eq : maccfit ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the resulting accretion - driven wind to this scatter is explored further below in   5.4 .",
    "classical t tauri magnetospheric accretion is believed to end at an age around 10 myr ( e.g. , strom et al .",
    "1989 ; bouvier et al .",
    "this is probably coincident with the time when the inner edge of the accretion disk grows to a larger extent than the keplerian corotation radius , with `` propeller - like '' outflow replacing the accretion ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; ustyugova et al .",
    "rotation is not included in the models presented here , so this criterion is not applied directly .",
    "however , for advanced ages ( e.g. , @xmath30 myr ) equation ( [ eq : maccfit ] ) gives increasingly weak accretion rates that end up not having any significant effect on the stellar wind .",
    "thus , even though the figures below plot the various accretion - driven quantities up to an age of 1 gyr ( @xmath31 ) , the models below do not apply any abrupt cutoff to the accretion rate .",
    "figure 3_b _ plots mass loss rates @xmath4 for a subset of classical t tauri stars that have measurements of blueshifted emission in forbidden lines such as [ ] @xmath326300 ( hartigan et al .   1995 ) .",
    "the mass loss rates are shown as an efficiency ratio @xmath33 which depends on the combined uncertainties of both the outflow and accretion properties .",

    "2006 ) , but these rates can be used as upper limits for any stellar wind component .",
    "figure 3 also gives additional information about two of the oldest reported classical t tauri stars : tw hya and mp mus .",

    "the age of tw hya is quite uncertain ; it is often given as @xmath010 myr ( e.g. , muzerolle et al .",
    "2000 ) , but values as large as 30 myr have been computed ( batalha et al .   2002 ) and the plotted error bar attempts to span this range .",
    "similarly , the age of mp mus seems to be between 7 and 23 myr ( e.g. , argiroffi et al .   2007 ) .",

    "the dynamical properties of accretion streams are modeled here using an axisymmetric dipole magnetic field , coupled with the assumption of ballistic infall ( e.g. , calvet & hartmann 1992 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "although it is almost certain that the actual magnetic fields of t tauri stars are not dipolar ( donati et al .   2007 ; jardine et al .",
    "2008 ) , this assumption allows the properties of the accretion streams to be calculated simply and straightforwardly as a function of evolutionary age .",
    "stellar field lines that thread the accretion disk are bounded between inner and outer radii @xmath39 and @xmath40 as measured in the equatorial plane .",
    "we assume the inner radius  also called the `` truncation radius''is described by knigl s ( 1991 ) application of neutron - star accretion theory ( see also davidson & ostriker 1973 ; elsner & lamb 1977 ; ghosh & lamb 1979a , b ) .",

    "the clump `` overdensity ratio '' ( @xmath93 ) can be computed by comparing the volume subtended by one clump with the volume traversed by a clump over time @xmath94 . in other words , if one assumes that @xmath95 , one can find the mean density @xmath91 by spreading out the gas in each clump to fill its own portion of the flux tube .",
    "thus , @xmath96 the overdensity ratio ( or , equivalently , @xmath86 ) is a free parameter of this system , and a value of @xmath97 was chosen more or less arbitrarily .",
    "this sets @xmath98 .",
    "below , the resulting alfvn wave amplitude ( caused by the periodic clump impacts ) is found to depend on an overall factor of @xmath99 ; i.e. , it is relatively insensitive to the chosen value of the overdensity ratio .    in order to relate the inhomogeneous properties along a given flux tube to the total mass accretion rate @xmath21 , the total number of flux tubes impacting the star must be calculated .",
    "the quantity @xmath100 is defined as the number of flux tubes _ in either the northern or southern hemisphere _ that contain accreting clumps .",
    "this definition is specific to the assumption of an aligned dipole magnetic field , and it is convenient because the summed effect of infalling clumps measured at the north [ south ] pole is assumed to depend only on the flux tubes in the northern [ southern ] hemisphere .",
    "the total number of flux tubes impacting the star is thus assumed to be @xmath101 .",
    "one can compute @xmath100 by comparing two different ways of expressing the mass accretion rate .",
    "first , we know that in a time - averaged sense , mass is accreted with a local flux @xmath102 over a subset of the stellar surface @xmath61 given by equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath103 alternately , the mass in the @xmath101 flux tubes can be summed up by knowing that each clump deposits a mass @xmath104 , with @xmath105 equations ( [ eq : mblob1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mblob2 ] ) must give the same total accretion rate , so equating them gives a useful expression for @xmath106 where equation ( [ eq : overden ] ) was also used .",
    "this quantity is used below to compute the total effect of waves at the poles from the individual impact events .",
    "figure 4_a _ shows @xmath107 ( rather than @xmath100 itself , to keep it on the same scale as the other plotted quantities ) , and it is interesting that @xmath100 remains reasonably constant around 100150 over most of the classical t tauri phase of evolution .",
    "this mean value ( for any instant of time ) is large , but it is not so large that any fluctuations around the mean would be unresolvable due to averaging over the star . if the distribution of flux tubes is assumed to follow some kind of poisson - like statistics , a standard deviation of order @xmath108 would be expected . in other words , for @xmath109 there may always be something like a 10% level of fluctuations in the magnetospheric accretion rate .",
    "the equations above also allow @xmath91 and @xmath87 to be computed from the known accretion rate @xmath21 .",
    "figure 4_b _ shows @xmath91 to typically be several orders of magnitude smaller than both @xmath69 and @xmath72 .",
    "this large difference arises because the ram pressure inside the accretion stream is much larger than the gas pressure in the stream .",
    "the ratio @xmath110 at the stellar surface is given very roughly by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the sound speed corresponding to @xmath11 , and @xmath113 .",
    "for the youngest t tauri stars modeled , however , @xmath114 and thus @xmath115 .",
    "this section utilizes the results of scheurwater & kuijpers ( 1988 ) , who computed the flux of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves that arise from the impact of a dense clump onto a stellar surface .",
    "scheurwater & kuijpers ( 1988 ) derived the total energy released in both alfvn and fast - mode mhd waves from such an impact in the `` far - field '' limit ( i.e. , at horizontal distances large compared to the clump size @xmath81 ) .",
    "slow - mode mhd waves were not considered because of the use of the cold - plasma approximation .",
    "the models below utilize only their alfvn wave result , since the efficiency of fast - mode wave generation was found to be significantly lower than for alfvn waves .",
    "also , due to their compressibility , the magnetosonic ( fast and slow mode ) mhd waves are expected to dissipate more rapidly than alfvn waves in stellar atmospheres ( e.g. , kuperus et al .   1981 ; narain & ulmschneider 1990 , 1996 ; whang 1997 ) . thus , even if fast - mode and alfvn waves were generated in equal amounts at the impact site , the fast - mode waves may not survive their journey to the polar wind - generation regions of the star without being strongly damped .    for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that waves propagate away from the impact site with an overall energy given by the scheurwater & kuijpers ( 1988 ) alfvn wave result , and that the waves undergo negligible dissipation .",
    "the wave energy released in one impact event is given by @xmath116 where the numerical factor in front was given approximately as 0.07 in equation ( 57 ) of scheurwater & kuijpers ( 1988 ) , but has been calculated more precisely from their bessel - function integral . in this context , the alfvn speed @xmath117 is defined as that of the ambient medium , with @xmath118 and @xmath119 g is the ambient magnetic field strength at the stellar surface , where the accretion streams connect with the star .",
    "scheurwater & kuijpers ( 1988 ) assumed that @xmath120 ( i.e. , that the impacting clumps do not strongly distort the background magnetic field ) .",
    "this tends to lead to a very low efficiency of wave generation , such that equation ( [ eq : ea ] ) may be considered a `` conservative '' lower limit to the available energy of fluctuations . for a given accretion column ,",
    "the wave power that is emitted continuously by a stream of clumps is given by @xmath121 .    in order to compute the wave energy density at other points on the stellar surface",
    ", we make the assumption that the waves propagate out _ horizontally _ from the impact point .",
    "it is important to note that ideal alfvn waves do not propagate any energy perpendicularly to the background magnetic field .",
    "there are several reasons , however , why this does not disqualify the adopted treatment of wave energy propagation over the horizontal stellar surface .",
    "first , the true evolution of the impact pulse is probably nonlinear . much like the solar moreton and eit waves discussed in",
    "  2 , nonlinear effects such as mode coupling , shock steepening , and soliton - like coherence are likely to be acting to help convey the total `` fluctuation yield '' of the impact across the stellar surface .",
    "second , for any real star , the background magnetic field is never completely radial , and it will always have some component horizontal to the surface ( along which even linear alfvn waves can propagate ) .",
    "thus , the dominant end - result of multiple cloud impacts is assumed here to be _ some _ kind of transverse field - line perturbations that are treated for simplicity with the energetics of alfvn waves .",
    "considering waves that spread out in circular ripples from the impact point , the goal is to compute the horizontal wave flux ( power per unit area ) at a distance @xmath122 away from the central point . for this purpose ,",
    "the stellar surface can be treated as a flat plane .",
    "the wave power is assumed to be emitted into an expanding cylinder with an approximate height of @xmath123 ( the clump diameter ) and a horizontal radius @xmath122 .",
    "the horizontal flux @xmath124 of waves into the vertical wall of the cylinder is given by dividing the power by the area of the surrounding wall , with @xmath125 note that the flux decreases linearly with increasing @xmath122 , as is expected for a cylindrical geometry .",
    "the total wave flux from the effect of multiple clump impacts is computed at the north or south pole of the star .",
    "the accretion stream impact points are assumed to be distributed circularly in a ring around the pole .",
    "thus , using the geometric quantities derived earlier , this implies @xmath126 . also , because each accretion column is assumed to be at the same horizontal distance from the target point at the pole , the total wave flux is given straightforwardly by @xmath100 times the flux due to one stream of clumps .",
    "the total accretion - driven wave flux arriving at either the north or south pole is thus given by @xmath127 .",
    "it is assumed that the waves do not damp appreciably between where they are generated ( at the bases of the accretion streams ) and their destination ( at the pole ) .",
    "the standard definition of the flux of alfvn waves , in a medium where the bulk flow speed is negligible in comparison to the alfvn speed , is @xmath128 this can be compared with the total wave flux derived above to obtain the perpendicular alfvn wave velocity amplitude @xmath129 . in units of the clump infall velocity @xmath130 , the wave amplitude is thus given by @xmath131 note that there is no actual dependence on @xmath92 , since the explicit factor of @xmath92 in the denominator is canceled by the density dependence of @xmath132 .",
    "the wave amplitude derived in equation ( [ eq : vperpsh ] ) is the value at the shock impact height , which formally can be above or below the photosphere .",
    "the stellar wind models below , though , require the alfvn wave amplitude to be specified exactly at the photosphere .",
    "if we assume that the wave energy density @xmath133 is conserved between the shock height and the photosphere , then the densities at those heights can be used to scale one to the other , with @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the photospheric wave amplitude , and the densities @xmath72 and @xmath69 were defined above in   3.2 .",
    "although the overall energy budget of accretion - driven waves is treated under the assumption that the waves are alfvnic , it is likely that the strongly nonlinear stream impacts also give rise to compressible waves of some kind .",
    "as mentioned above , the analysis of scheurwater & kuijpers ( 1988 ) did not take account of slow - mode mhd waves that , for parallel propagation and a strong background field , are identical to hydrodynamic acoustic waves .",
    "there is evidence , however , that another highly nonlinear mhd phenomenon  turbulent subsurface convection  gives rise to both longitudinal ( compressible ) and transverse ( incompressible ) mhd waves with roughly comparable energy densities ( e.g. , musielak & ulmschneider 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the models below are given a photospheric source of accretion - driven _",
    "acoustic waves _ that are in energy equipartition with the accretion - driven alfvn waves ; i.e. , @xmath136 .",
    "the upward flux of acoustic waves is thus given by @xmath137 , where @xmath112 is the sound speed appropriate for @xmath11 .",
    "for both the acoustic and alfvn waves at the photosphere , the accretion - driven component is added to the intrinsic ( convection - driven ) component .",
    "a key assumption of this paper is that the convection - driven component is held fixed , as a function of age , at the values used by cranmer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the present - day sun .",
    "this results in minimum values for the alfvn wave amplitude ( 0.255 km s@xmath7 ) and the acoustic wave flux ( @xmath138 erg @xmath139 s@xmath7 ) below which the models never go .",
    "there are hints that rapidly rotating young stars may undergo more intense subsurface convection than the evolved slowly rotating sun ( kpyl et al .   2007 ; brown et al . 2007 ;",
    "ballot et al .",
    "2007 ) , but the implications of these additional variations with age are left for future work ( see also   6 ) .",
    "figure 5 displays various velocity quantities used in the accretion - driven wave scenario . the clump free - fall speed @xmath140 always remains smaller than the ambient alfvn speed @xmath117 , which was an assumption that scheurwater & kuijpers ( 1988 ) had to make in order for the background magnetic field to remain relatively undisturbed by the clumps .",
    "the accretion - driven alfvn wave amplitude at the shock is larger than that measured at the photosphere ( see eq .  [ [ eq : vpast ] ] ) , and at ages later than about 60 myr the accretion - driven waves at the photosphere grow weak enough to be overwhelmed by the convection - driven waves . for a limited range of younger ages ( @xmath141 yr ) the alfvn wave motions are supersonic in the photosphere , with a peak value of @xmath142 km s@xmath7 at @xmath143 yr .",
    "the sharp decrease in wave amplitude at the youngest ages is due to the inner edge of the accretion disk coming closer to the stellar surface . in that limit ,",
    "the ballistic infall speed @xmath83 becomes small and the latitudinal distance @xmath122 traversed by the waves becomes large , thus leaving negligible energy in the waves once they reach the pole .    finally , it is worthwhile to sum up how the above values depend on the relatively large number of assumptions made about the accretion streams .",
    "first , the use of an aligned dipole field for the accretion streams , the knigl ( 1991 ) expression for @xmath39 , and the `` string of pearls '' model of clumps along the flux tubes are all somewhat simplistic and should be replaced by more realistic conditions in future work .",
    "second , there are three primary parameters that had to be specified in order to determine numerical values for the accretion properties .",
    "these are : ( 1 ) the relative size of the outer disk radius with respect to the inner disk radius ; i.e. , @xmath46 , ( 2 ) the clump overdensity ratio @xmath144 , and ( 3 ) the magnetic field strength at the base of the accretion streams @xmath145 g. third , probably the most idealistic assumption in the modeled evolutionary sequence is the use of a single monotonic relation for @xmath21 versus @xmath12 ( e.g. , eq .  [ [ eq : maccfit ] ] ) . ",
    "6 describes how these assumptions can be relaxed in subsequent modeling efforts .",
    "the steady - state outflow models presented here are numerical solutions to one - fluid conservation equations for mass , momentum , and energy along a polar flux tube . for the specific case of the solar wind , cranmer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) presented these equations and described their self - consistent numerical solution using a computer code called zephyr .",
    "the t tauri wind models are calculated with an updated version of zephyr , with specific differences from the solar case described below .",
    "the equation of mass conservation along a magnetic flux tube is @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the wind speed and mass density specified as functions of radial distance @xmath149 , and @xmath150 is the cross - sectional area of the polar flux tube .",
    "magnetic flux conservation demands that the product @xmath151 is constant along the flux tube , where @xmath152 is the field strength that is specified explicitly .",

    "a complete expression for @xmath155 in the presence of damped acoustic and alfvn waves was given by cranmer et al .",

    "the gas pressure is given by @xmath156 , where @xmath122 is the hydrogen ionization fraction .",
    "note that although the pressure is calculated for a hydrogen gas , the radiative cooling rate @xmath157 used in the energy equation is dominated by metals .",
    "cranmer et al .   ( 2007 ) tested the zephyr code with two separate assumptions for the ionization balance .",
    "first , a self - consistent , but computationally intensive solution was used , which implemented a three - level hydrogen atom . in that model ,",
    "the @xmath158 and @xmath159 levels were assumed to remain in relative local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and the full rate equation between @xmath159 and the continuum was solved iteratively .",
    "second , a simpler tabulated function of @xmath122 as a function of temperature @xmath160 was taken from a semi - empirical non - lte model of the solar photosphere , chromosphere , and transition region ( e.g. , avrett & loeser 2008 ) .",
    "for both the solar and t tauri star applications , the results for the two cases were extremely similar , and thus the simpler tabulated function was used in the models described below .",
    "for solar - type winds , the key equation for both heating the corona and setting the mass loss rate is the conservation of internal energy , @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the internal energy density and the terms on the right - hand side are volumetric heating / cooling rates due to radiation , conduction , alfvn wave damping , and acoustic ( sound ) wave damping .",
    "the terms on the left - hand side that depend on @xmath147 are responsible for enthalpy transport and adiabatic cooling . in a partially ionized plasma ,",
    "the definition of @xmath162 is convention - dependent ; we use the same one as ulmschneider & muchmore ( 1986 ) and mullan & cheng ( 1993 ) , which is @xmath163 , where @xmath164 ev .",
    "the net heating / cooling from conduction ( @xmath165 ) is given by a gradual transition between classical spitzer - hrm conductivity ( when the electron collision rate is fast compared to the wind expansion rate ) and hollweg s ( 1974 , 1976 ) prescription for free - streaming heat flux in the collisionless heliosphere ( when electron collisions are negligible ) .",
    "all of these terms were described in more detail by cranmer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the volumetric radiative heating / cooling rate @xmath157 has been modified slightly from the earlier solar models .",
    "the solar rate is first computed as in cranmer et al .",

    "a simple expression that bridges the optically thin and thick limits , for a line with voigt wings , is @xmath170 ( e.g. , mihalas 1978 ) , which may err on the side of overestimating the escape probability and thus would give a conservative undercorrection to @xmath157 .",

    "( 2007 ) . given a specified frequency spectrum of acoustic and alfvn wave power in the photosphere , equations of wave action conservation are solved to determine the radial evolution of the wave amplitudes .",
    "acoustic waves are damped by both heat conduction and entropy gain at shock discontinuities .",

    "coupled with the wave action equations are also non - wkb transport equations to determine the degree of linear reflection of the alfvn waves ( e.g. , heinemann & olbert 1980 ) .",
    "this is required because the turbulent dissipation rate depends on differences in energy density between upward and downward traveling waves ( see also matthaeus et al .",

    "the zephyr code was designed to utilize as few free parameters as possible .",
    "for example , the coronal heating rate and the spatial length scales of wave dissipation are computed _ internally _ from straightforward physical principles and are not input as adjustable parameters . however , there are quantities that do need to be specified prior to solving the equations given in   4.1 .",
    "an important input parameter to zephyr is the radial dependence of the background magnetic field @xmath152 .",
    "although many stellar field - strength measurements have been made , relatively little is known about how rapidly @xmath194 decreases with increasing height above the photosphere , or how fragmented the flux tubes become on the granulation scale .",
    "some information about this kind of structure is contained in `` filling factors '' that can be determined observationally ( e.g. , saar 2001 ) .",
    "however , these measurements may be biased toward the bright closed - field active regions and not the footpoints of stellar wind streams .",
    "thus , as in other areas of this study , the present - day solar case was adopted as a baseline on which to vary the evolving properties of the 1 @xmath23 model star .",
    "the multi - scale polar coronal hole field of cranmer & van ballegooijen ( 2005 ) was used as the starting point for the younger t tauri models .",
    "the lower regions of that model were derived for a magnetostatic balance between the strong - field ( low density ) solar wind flux tube and the weak - field ( high density ) surrounding atmosphere .",
    "the radial dependence of magnetic pressure @xmath195 thus scales with the gas pressure @xmath154 . in the t tauri models , then , the lower part of the magnetic field was stretched in radius in proportion with the pressure scale height @xmath16 .",

    "the justification for this is that the horizontal scale of convective granulation is believed to be set by the scale height ( e.g. , robinson et al .",

    "the dominant physical processes that drive the evolving stellar winds are revealed when examining the maximum temperatures in the models , as shown in figure 7_c_. the older ( @xmath216 myr ) models with high wind speeds and solar - like mass loss rates have hot coronae , with peak temperatures between @xmath2 and @xmath217 k. the younger models undergo a rapid drop in temperature , ultimately leading to `` extended chromospheres '' with peak temperatures around @xmath180 k. this transition occurs because of a well - known _ thermal instability _ in the radiative cooling rate @xmath157 ( e.g. , parker 1953 ; field 1965 ; rosner et al .   1978 ; suzuki 2007 ) . at temperatures below about @xmath218 k , the cooling rate decreases with decreasing @xmath160 , and small temperature perturbations are easily stabilized . however , above @xmath218 k , @xmath157 decreases as @xmath160 increases , which gives any small increase in temperature an unstable runaway toward larger values .",
    "this is the same instability that helps lead to the sharp transition region between the @xmath180 k solar chromosphere and the @xmath2 k corona ( see also hammer 1982 ; withbroe 1988 ; owocki 2004 ) .",
    "the reason that the young and old models in figure 7 end up on opposite sides of the thermal instability is that the total rates of energy input ( i.e. , the wave heating rates @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) vary strongly as a function of age .",

    "the coronal winds are driven by comparable contributions from gas pressure and wave pressure .",

    "the mass flux for the older , solar - like models can be explained well by the energy balance between heat conduction , radiative losses , and the upward enthalpy flux .",
    "the atmosphere finds the height of the transition region that best matches these sources and sinks of energy in a time - steady way , and the resulting gas pressure at this height sets the mass flux .",

    "note also that the older `` coronal '' models have critical points in the sub - alfvnic wind ( @xmath222 ) and the younger `` extended chromosphere '' models have larger critical radii that are in the super - alfvnic ( @xmath223 ) part of the wind .",
    "also plotted in figure 8_a _ is the so - called wind luminosity @xmath224 , which we estimate from the sum of the energy required to lift the wind out of the gravitational potential and the remaining kinetic energy of the flow , i.e. , @xmath225 ( e.g. , clayton 1966 ) .",

    "there are two additional points of comparison with other work that should be made in the light of the main results shown in figures 79 .    1 .",

    ", the inclusion of _ rotation - dependent _ convection may give rise to a stronger variation in the turbulent fluctuation amplitude with age , and thus also a more pronounced age dependence of the rates of coronal heating and mass loss .",
    "2 .   suzuki ( 2007 ) modeled the extended atmospheres and winds of low - gravity cool stars , and found that the onset of thermal instability gave rise to large amounts of time variability .",
    "these models often showed dense and cool shells that coexist with spontaneously produced hot and tenuous `` bubbles . ''",
    "suzuki ( 2007 ) noted that this dynamical instability began to occur once the escape velocity @xmath231 ( measured in the wind acceleration region ) dropped to the point of being of the same order of magnitude as the sound speed corresponding to the thermal instability temperature of @xmath232 k. it is unclear , though , whether this variability is triggered only for relatively moderate rates of turbulent energy input , like the amplitudes derived by suzuki ( 2007 ) from non - rotating convection models .",
    "the larger amplitudes used in the present models of accretion - driven waves may be sufficient to drive the winds much more robustly _ past _ the thermal instability and into time - steady extended chromospheres ( see also killie 2002 ) .      the zephyr code could not find time - independent wind solutions for ages younger than about 0.45 myr ( i.e. , for accretion rates larger than about @xmath233 @xmath23 yr@xmath7 ) .",
    "this was found _ not _ to be a numerical effect .",
    "instead , it is an outcome of the requirement that time - steady winds must have a sufficient amount of outward acceleration ( either due to gas pressure or some other external forcing , like waves ) to drive material out of the star s gravitational potential well to a finite coasting speed at infinity .",
    "this was realized for _ polytropic _ gas - pressure - driven winds very early on ( parker 1963 ; holzer & axford 1970 ) , such that if the temperature decreases too rapidly with increasing distance ( i.e. , with decreasing density ) the wind would become `` stalled '' and not have a time - steady solution .    to illustrate how this effect occurs for the youngest , wave - driven models , let us write and analyze an approximate equation of momentum conservation . for simplicity",
    ", the wind temperature @xmath160 is assumed to be constant , and the radii of interest are far enough from the star such that the flux - tube expansion can be assumed to be spherical , with @xmath234 .",
    "also , for these models the acoustic wave pressure can be ignored ( since compressive waves damp out rather low in the atmosphere ) , and the radial behavior of the alfvn wave amplitude can be modeled roughly in the dissipationless limit .",
    "thus , one can follow jacques ( 1977 ) and write the momentum equation as a modified critical point equation @xmath235 at the wave - modified critical point ( @xmath236 ) , the wind speed @xmath147 equals the critical speed @xmath227 , which is defined as @xmath237 where the squared isothermal sound speed is @xmath238 , and the bulk - flow alfvn mach number @xmath239 . a more general version of equation ( [ eq : ucold ] ) that also contains damping and acoustic wave pressure is given in , e.g. ,   6 of cranmer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the above expressions show how the outward pressure , which balances gravity at the critical point , can be dominated either by @xmath240 ( gas pressure ) or by a term proportional to @xmath241 ( wave pressure ) . for gas pressure that can be described as a polytrope ( i.e. , @xmath242 )",

    "larger polytropic indices @xmath244 imply that @xmath240 drops too rapidly with increasing distance to provide sufficient acceleration for a parcel accelerated through the critical point to escape to infinity .    for winds dominated by wave pressure , it is possible to use the equation of wave action conservation ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : wact ] ] ) to examine the density dependence of the wave amplitude in a similar way as above ( e.g. , jacques 1977 ; heinemann & olbert 1980 ; cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ) .",

    "the dimensionless quantity in parentheses in equation ( [ eq : ucrit ] ) varies only between 1 and 3 over the full range of distances , and can be assumed to be roughly constant compared to the density dependence of @xmath129 .",
    "thus , by comparing the polytropic , gas - pressure dominated expression for @xmath253 to the wave - pressure dominated version , it becomes possible to write an _ effective polytropic index _ for the latter case as @xmath254 .",

    "indeed , this corresponds to the youngest models shown in figures 79 .",

    "an isolated parcel of gas with an outflow speed @xmath258 at the critical point would be decelerated to stagnation at some height above the critical point , and it would want to fall back down towards the star . in reality , this parcel would collide with other parcels that are still accelerating , and a stochastic collection of shocked clumps is likely to result .",
    "interactions between these parcels may result in an extra degree of collisional heating that could act as an extended source of gas pressure to help maintain a mean net outward flow .",

    "time - steady stellar winds were found to be supportable for all ages older than about 0.45 myr , with accretion rates less than @xmath233 @xmath23 yr@xmath7 driving mass loss rates less than @xmath211 @xmath23 yr@xmath7 .",
    "still younger t tauri stars ( i.e. , ages between about 13 kyr and 0.45 myr ) may exhibit time - variable winds with mass loss rates extending up several more orders of magnitude to @xmath291 @xmath23 yr@xmath7 .",
    "the transition between time - steady and variable winds occurs when the critical point of the flow migrates far enough past the alfvn point ( at which the wind speed equals the alfvn speed ) such that the alfvn wave amplitude begins to decline rapidly with increasing radius .",
    "when this happens , the outward wave - pressure acceleration is quickly `` choked off ; ''",
    "i.e. , parcels of gas that make it past the critical point can not be accelerated to infinity , and stochastic collisions between upflowing and downflowing parcels must begin to occur .",
    "the maximum wind efficiency ratio @xmath33 for the t tauri models computed here was approximately 1.4% , computed for ages of order 0.1 myr .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the values of order 10% required by matt & pudritz ( 2005 , 2007 , 2008 ) to remove enough angular momentum from the young solar system to match present - day conditions .",
    "it is also well below the observational ratios derived by , e.g. , hartigan et al .",
    "( 1995 , 2004 ) , which can reach up to 20% for t tauri stars between 1 and 10 myr old ( see fig .  12 ) . these higher ratios , though , may be the product of both stellar winds and disk winds ( possibly even dominated by the disk wind component ) .",
    "additionally , it is possible that future observational analysis will result in these empirical ratios being revised _",
    "upward _ with more accurate ( lower ) values of @xmath21 ( s.   edwards 2008 , private communication ) .    the accretion - driven solutions for @xmath4 depend crucially on the properties of the waves in the polar regions .",
    "it is important to note that the calculation of mhd wave properties was based on several assumptions that should be examined in more detail .",
    "the relatively low mhd wave efficiency used in equation ( [ eq : ea ] ) is an approximation based on the limiting case of waves being far from the impact site .",
    "a more realistic model would have to contain additional information about both the nonlinearities of the waves themselves and the vertical atmospheric structure through which the waves propagate .",
    "it seems likely that a better treatment of the wave generation would lead to larger wave energies at the poles . on the other hand ,",
    "the assumption that the waves do not damp significantly between their generation point and the polar wind regions may have led to an assumed wave energy that is too high .",
    "it is unclear how strong the waves will be in a model that takes account of all of the above effects . in any case , the zephyr results presented here are the first self - consistent models of t tauri stellar winds that produce wind efficiency ratios that even get into the right `` ballpark '' of the angular momentum requirements .",
    "additional improvements in the models are needed to make further progress .",
    "for example , the effects of stellar rotation should be included , both in the explicit wind dynamics ( e.g. , `` magneto - centrifugal driving , '' as recently applied by holzwarth & jardine 2007 ) and in the modified subsurface convective activity that is likely to affect photospheric amplitudes of waves and turbulence .",
    "young and rapidly rotating stars are likely to have qualitatively different convective motions than are evident in standard ( nonrotating , mixing - length ) models .",
    "it is uncertain , though , whether rapid rotation gives rise to larger ( kpyl et al .   2007",
    "; brown et al . 2007 ; ballot et al . 2007 ) or smaller ( chan 2007 ) convection eddy velocities at the latitudes of interest for t tauri stellar winds . in any case , rapid rotation can also increase the buoyancy of subsurface magnetic flux elements , leading to a higher rate of flux emergence ( holzwarth 2007 ) .",
    "also , the lower gravities of t tauri stars may give rise to a larger fraction of the convective velocity reaching the surface as wave energy ( e.g. , renzini et al .",
    "1977 ) , or the convection may even penetrate directly into the photosphere ( montalbn et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "future work must involve not only increased physical realism for the models , but also quantitative comparisons with observations . the methodology outlined in this paper",
    "should be applied to a set of real stars , rather than to the idealized evolutionary sequence of representative parameters .",
    "measured stellar masses , radii , and @xmath11 values , as well as accretion rates , magnetic field strengths , and hot spot filling factors ( @xmath61 ) , should be used as constraints on individual calculations for the stellar wind properties .",
    "it should also be possible to use measured three - dimensional magnetic fields ( e.g. , donati et al .",
    "2007 ; jardine et al .   2008 ) to more accurately map out the patterns of accretion stream footpoints , wave fluxes , and the flux tubes in which stellar winds are accelerated .",
    "this work helps to accomplish the larger goal of understanding the physics responsible for low - mass stellar outflows and the feedback between accretion disks , winds , and stellar magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , there are links to more interdisciplinary studies of how stars affect objects in young solar systems . for example",
    ", the coronal activity and wind of the young sun is likely to have created many of the observed abundance and radionuclide patterns in early meteorites ( lee et al .",
    "1998 ) and possibly affected the earth s atmospheric chemistry to the point of influencing the development of life ( see , e.g. , ribas et al .",
    "2005 ; gdel 2007 ; cuntz et al .",
    "the identification of key physical processes in young stellar winds is important not only for understanding stellar and planetary evolution , but also for being able to model and predict the present - day impacts of solar variability and `` space weather '' ( e.g. , feynman & gabriel 2000 ; cole 2003 ) .",

    "<S> this added energy , determined quantitatively from the far - field theory of mhd wave generation , is sufficient to produce t tauri - like mass loss rates of at least 0.01 times the accretion rate . while still about an order of magnitude below the level required for efficient angular momentum removal , these are the first self - consistent models of t tauri winds that agree reasonably well with a range of observational mass loss constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the youngest modeled stellar winds are supported by alfvn wave pressure , they have low temperatures ( `` extended chromospheres '' ) , and they are likely to be unstable to the formation of counterpropagating shocks and clumps far from the star . </S>"
