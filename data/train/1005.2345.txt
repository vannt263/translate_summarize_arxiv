    "even though a number of microlensing projects have yielded rr lyrae light curves with excellent phase coverage ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , phase coverage is more of a problem when studying rr lyraes in external galaxies . in order to overcome this",
    ", a number of methods have been developed to use the observed data to get a smooth approximation to the actual rr lyrae light curve that captures any real physical bumps or dips and eliminates any that are caused by numerics .",
    "the traditional method applied has been fourier decomposition wherein the observed data are fit by an expression of the form @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the order of the fit , @xmath5 is the mean magnitude , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the pulsating period and @xmath8 is the time of observation .",
    "usually a least squares fitting procedure yields @xmath5 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 a major problem with this technique is ringing : the fourier curve given by equation ( 1 ) exhibits a series of unphysical bumps and dips .",
    "this can occur even when the original data are well distributed in phase but exhibit a large scatter .",
    "this is exacerbated when there are noticable gaps in phase coverage .",
    "the solution to this is to reduce the order of the fit but then this looses real features of the light curve .",
    "another method is that of principal component analysis ( pca , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for examples ) . here instead of sine functions being the basis ,",
    "the data itself determines these basis functions : the resulting light curve is expressed as a sum of these basis functions .",
    "pca has the advantage that a very good approximation of the light curve can be realised with significantly fewer parameters than required by the fourier method .",
    "however , while a stringent comparison of the two methods is beyond the scope of this paper , we can say that , at least in the case of rr@xmath1 stars , the parameters of a fit using the methods developed here do have some physical interpretation .    @xcite studied the method of cubic splines in approximating variable star light curves .",
    "a cubic spline is a series of cubic polynomials pieced together such that the intersection of two such polynomials is required to be continuous up to the second derivative .",
    "our method uses cubic polynomials but does not require continuity up to the second derivative . looking at figure 4 in @xcite , the graphs for lcb12 , lcr12 , we again see ringing as a result of having 16 parameters : as our results show , this is a clear reason why cubics polynomials as opposed to cubic splines are to be preferred in approximating rr lyrae light curves .",
    "one motivation for this study is that requiring continuity up to the second derivative seems too stringent .",
    "pulsation shocks are dramatic events with sudden reversals .",
    "there is no reason to suppose any fitted curve is continuously differentiable to the second degree .",
    "this is particularly true of fundamental mode rr lyraes at phases close to minimum light where the star suddenly starts to get brighter . in this paper",
    "we examine the use of cubic polynomials to fit the light curves of rr lyraes by requiring continuity only up to the first derivative .",
    "we define @xmath11 ( for any real number @xmath8 and positive real @xmath7 ) to be that positive number @xmath12 satisfying both @xmath13 and @xmath14 is an integer .",
    "we are interested in approximating data points : @xmath15 by a periodic function @xmath16 of period @xmath7 .",
    "the residuals from our fit are @xmath17 we define @xmath18 to be the proportion of the period when the luminosity is decreasing ( which , when magnitudes are used , results in the proportion of the period when the @xmath19 are increasing ) .",
    "let @xmath20 be the average of the @xmath21 define the total sum of squares , @xmath22 , to be @xmath23 ^ 2,\\ ] ] and the error sum of squares , @xmath24 , as @xmath25 the quantity @xmath26 , is defined as , @xmath27 and is the portion of the variation of the @xmath28 explained by our model @xmath29 .",
    "the adjusted @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath31 , is @xmath32 where there are @xmath33 parameters .",
    "then the best fit is from that combination of parameters such thet @xmath24 is a minimum .    for any function",
    "which is twice differentiable except for a finite set of points , we define the total bending ( @xmath34 ) as follows : divide the domain ( @xmath35 $ ] if periodic with period @xmath7 ) into intervals so that on each interval , the function is only concave up or down . on each interval ,",
    "the bending is the angle between the tangent lines at the two endpoints ( not through the vertical ) and at each nondifferentiable point , the angle between the left and right sided tangent lines .",
    "@xmath34 is the sum of all these angles .",
    "this provides a good measure of `` ringing '' .",
    "we use an @xmath36 test @xcite to test for the significance of having a more / less complex model .",
    "this @xmath36 statistic is @xmath37/[df(n)-df(a)]}{sse(a)/df(a)},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the error sum of squares , @xmath4 and @xmath38 stand for null hypothesis ( less complex model ) and alternative hypothesis ( more complex model ) respectively .",
    "the expression @xmath39 stands for degrees of freedom which is the number of data points minus the number of parameters .",
    "our goal is to obtain good approximations which reflect the true shape of the light curve , yet are simple and without ringing or other anomalies .",
    "our method is based on the observation than an increasing or decreasing portion of @xmath40 function can be remarkably well approximated by a cubic polynomial .",
    "we note also that a cubic polynomial is uniquely determined by the @xmath41 coordinate and the slope at two points .",
    "rr lyrae light curves come in basically two varieties : types @xmath2 and @xmath1 corresponding to fundamental and overtone modes respectively . for the overtone @xmath1 type , both increasing and decreasing portions are roughly half the period of a sine curve ( of different periods ) and each can be approximated by a cubic .",
    "for the fundamental @xmath2 type , the increasing portion is roughly half of a period of a sine curve , while the decreasing part is similar to the bottom half of the decreasing half of a sine curve , though near the minimum , there is a noticeable dip before it starts to increase again .    in this paragraph , we outline the method in general terms and describe the details in the following paragraphs .",
    "essentially approximate rr lyrae light curves by either 2 cubics or 3 cubics .",
    "when we use 2 cubics , for example when trying to model rrc curves , the parameters of our fit are the period , shift ( phase point at which first observation occurs ) , the maximum and minimum and the proportion of the curve that is decreasing and the slope at maximum , that is a total of 6 parameters . in this case",
    ", it is clear that these parameters have a physical meaning .",
    "we choose these parameters in order to minimize the @xmath42 in this case the fitted curve is continous as is its derivative except perhaps at maximum . when we use 3 cubics , we choose 4 points with the understanding that the first and last points are the same and 3 time intervals .",
    "note the sum of these three time intervals is the period .",
    "we have the @xmath12 and @xmath41 values at these points and the slopes .",
    "this is a total of 9 parameters together with the shift as defined in the case of using 2 cubics .",
    "we choose these 10 parameters to minimize the @xmath24 as before .    with this in mind ,",
    "we define two different piecewise defined functions and their periodic extensions .",
    "@xmath43 is defined on @xmath44 to be that cubic which passes through the points @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , with derivative equal to @xmath47 at @xmath48 and with zero derivative at @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the maximum and minimum , respectively of the curve to be fitted .",
    "furthermore , @xmath43 is defined on @xmath52 to be that cubic which passes through the points @xmath46 and @xmath53 with derivative equal to zero at @xmath54 and @xmath55 the periodic extension @xmath56 is said to be of type @xmath57 this is continuous since @xmath58 note that for sinusoidal curves , @xmath47 will equal 0 ( @xmath59 will be differentiable ) while for fundamental @xmath2 type curves , @xmath47 will be positive and @xmath59 will not be differentiable . in all that follows , when we approximate a type @xmath1 by @xmath59 , we require @xmath60 and denote this by @xmath61 our parameters here are period , shift ( how far into the period the first data point is ) , @xmath47 , @xmath51 , @xmath50 , and @xmath62 again each of these parameters has some physical meaning .",
    "similarly @xmath63 is piecewise defined by dividing @xmath35 $ ] into three intervals , using a cubic on each and requiring continuity and differentiability where any two cubics meet . as before its periodic",
    "extension is of type @xmath64 our parameters here are period , shift , the two time values where continuity is required between two cubics , three @xmath41 values and three slopes . because of the simplicity of both @xmath65 and @xmath66 , there is no ringing .",
    "consequently , no noise is added when obtaining residuals .",
    "furthermore , having fewer parameters improves the power of an @xmath36 test .    in practice , we compute the mean and standard deviation for the original data",
    ". points beyond 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean are considered outliers and omitted .",
    "we need good initial guesses to best approximate out data . for @xmath59 ,",
    "our initial approximation comes from the fourier series of 7 terms and @xmath67 we use @xmath68 and replace each data point by @xmath69 by @xmath70 we are then in a position to minimize @xmath42 from the fourier fit , we find the maximum as the point ( shift , @xmath50 ) , followed by the minimum as ( shift + @xmath71 , m ) . for @xmath66 ,",
    "our initial approximation uses @xmath59 and we define @xmath72 to be between @xmath73 and @xmath74 of @xmath71 ( see later ) and use the intervals @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath52 for our three cubics .",
    "@xmath7 is obtained by maximizing the power function .",
    "we obtain both the @xmath41 coordinate and slope at @xmath77 , @xmath72 , @xmath71 from @xmath59 from which we obtain @xmath64 for @xmath66 , we define @xmath72 as @xmath73 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and then @xmath74 of @xmath71 . for each case",
    ", we find the minimum @xmath24 and keep the best ( smallest @xmath24 ) set of parameters .",
    "we continue our removal of outliers . for the residual , removing outliers based on the fourier series",
    "is not appropriate because of ringing .",
    "we look at residuals using both @xmath59 and @xmath66 . for each ,",
    "we compute the mean and standard deviation .",
    "we remove any points more than 3 standard deviations out using both criteria . when comparing various approximations",
    ", we compare all on this same final data set .",
    "we minimize @xmath24 by looping through the parameters with successively smaller step sizes , @xmath80 .",
    "for a fixed parameter , in addition to having the current value of @xmath81 we evaluate @xmath24 at this parameter plus @xmath80 , and at this parameter minus @xmath80 .",
    "finally we fit these three points by a quadratic polynomial , find its minimum and evaluate @xmath24 at this point . of the current four estimates of our parameter",
    ", we select the one giving the smallest @xmath24 as the parameter s new value .",
    "we continue this until we have a good approximation of a relative minimum .",
    "= 8.0 cm    we first test our method on a known function , where the known function is taken from the rr lyrae light curve templates developed by @xcite .",
    "we draw a random number of points from this function and independently add gaussian noise to each phase point .",
    "specifically , we add noise normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1 to the synthetic data . in our tests , this synthetic data is not a `` train '' of data but just covers approxiametly one period .",
    "we then try to reproduce the original curve using our cubic polynomial method and the traditional fourier technique .",
    "figure 1 presents our results . here the known function ( chosen to resemble a typical rr@xmath2 type light curve ) is the dashed curve .",
    "the open squares with error bars are the points drawn randomly from this function and to which gaussian noise has been added independently .",
    "the solid dark lines represent the fourier and cubic polynomial fits ( top and bottom panels respectively ) to these open square points .",
    "the curves are plotted as a function of phase , going from 0 to 1 .",
    "however , we allow the two methods to `` rediscover '' this periodicity .",
    "the fourier fit of order 6 yielded considerable ringing , a period of 1.14 and had a @xmath24 of @xmath82 .",
    "we emphasize that by a period of 1.14 , we do not mean a period of 1.14 days , but that this signifies a change in the period as reported by the fourier method when compared to the period of the original template curve from which the data were drawn . a reported period of 1 signifies no difference between the estimated and original period . approximating by a pair of cubics ( @xmath59 ) , we obtained a slightly different period of 0.997 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these values of @xmath47 and @xmath18 both indicate bailey type @xmath2 . using a @xmath66 ( differentialble ) approximation",
    ", we obtained a period of 1.00004 and @xmath86 .",
    "we see that our method does a very good job at mimicking the known function and has little to no ringing .",
    "in contrast , a fourier fit to the same points produces noticeable and significant ringing .",
    "further , the period obtained by the cubic polynomial method matches exactly that of the original curve .    next we tested our method on real data .",
    "the data were taken from @xcite and consist of @xmath0 observations of rr lyrae stars in the andromeda halo - along the southeast minor axis of m31 , about @xmath87 from the nucleus .",
    "the data are available at two wavelengths , f606w and f814w . in what follows",
    "we report results based on both bands ( f606w and f814w are referred to as the first and second bands respectively ) .",
    "@xcite used a fast algorithm based on the lomb - scargale periodogram @xcite to search for periodicities in their time series data after data reduction and photometry .",
    "@xcite analyzed these data and found 169 variables of which 55 were clearly rr lyraes .",
    "of these 55 stars , @xcite classified 29 as rr@xmath2 , 25 as rr@xmath1 and 1 as rr@xmath88 .",
    "it is the data for these 55 stars which we discuss in this paper .",
    "note we start with the photometry for these 55 stars as published in @xcite . as pointed out by the referee ,",
    "intrinsic precision in this dataset is about 0.03 and 0.04 in @xmath89 respectively .",
    "this measurement error is not accounted for in our fits but for the purposes of this paper it is appropriate since we are presenting a differential comparison between our method and that of fourier series .",
    "our data are not corrected for reddening .",
    "@xcite found a ratio of rr@xmath1 to rr@xmath90 of 0.46 , mean periods of rr@xmath1 and rr@xmath2 stars of 0.316 and 0.594 days respectively . in figures 2 - 4",
    ", the label `` normalized magnitude '' just refers to the fact that the magnitudes are scaled to lie between 0 and 1 .",
    "we note that these are hst data and as such somewhat immune to the 1-day aliasing problems arising when rr lyraes are observed from the ground .",
    "the sampling rate was 250 exposures over a 41 day period @xcite with a cadence that should be random enough to offset other aliasing problems .",
    "observations in the two bands were made at slightly different times : this again helps to counteract aliasing .",
    "= 8.0 cm    a major finding of our work is that when using the cubic polynomials method on the dataset mentioned , we find 23 rr@xmath1 stars with a mean period of 0.312 , 29 rr@xmath2 stars with a mean period of 0.594 .",
    "this leads to a ratio of rr@xmath1 to rr@xmath90 stars very similar to previous work : 0.442 .",
    "this ratio is lower than that reported in @xcite because there were two @xmath91 stars which were reclassified as @xmath92 in our work . in almost all cases ,",
    "the periods discovered by our method is very close to that published by @xcite .",
    "an intriguing result is that our method reveals significantly more multimode stars than previously discovered and we discuss this later in this section .",
    "first overtone stars all have periods less than 0.39 whilst fundamental mode stars have periods greater than 0.44 .",
    "a nice result is that the type @xmath1 stars all have @xmath93 while all type @xmath2 stars have @xmath94 we observe three other imperfect tests for bailey type .",
    "type @xmath1 has @xmath47 ( first band ) less than 0.76 except for v76 and v58 .",
    "@xmath18 ( second band ) is less than 0.76 except for v120 ; @xmath47 ( second band ) is less than 0.25 except for v40 and v120 .",
    "also , type @xmath2 has @xmath47 ( first band ) greater than 0.25 except for v78 ; @xmath18 ( second band greater than 0.76 except for v122 ; and @xmath47 ( second band ) is greater than 0.25 except for v66 , v71 and v82 . in every case , both bands have @xmath18 greater than 0.51 with two exceptions , both of which are in the second band where there is a generally more noise .",
    "for v76 , @xmath95 while for v157 , @xmath96 generally , the @xmath18 s of the two bands correlate nicely , as do the @xmath47 s .",
    "further , type @xmath1 all have @xmath97 while all type @xmath2 except v78 have @xmath98 this provides a good way to distinguish between types @xmath2 and @xmath99 type @xmath1 can be approximated about equally well by a fourier series of order 2 - 4 , or @xmath59 or @xmath66 .",
    "the advantages of using @xmath59 are its simplicity , minimal @xmath34 and using only parameters that have physical meaning .",
    "further we can generate @xmath18 and @xmath47 whose importance has already been established .",
    "the 23 type rr@xmath1 data sets can be summarized on average as follows .",
    "the average ra for @xmath59 and @xmath66 , we call @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . a similar quantity for an order 2 fourier series is labelled as @xmath102 likewise , @xmath34 for @xmath59 is named as @xmath103 and so on .",
    "we have @xmath104 and @xmath105 while @xmath106 @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "while @xmath66 may give slightly better approximations the extra bending strongly suggests it is not worth the effort .",
    "fourier series give somewhat worse approximations than @xmath59 with no reduction in bending .",
    "finally , @xmath59 is simplest and only involves parameters with physical meaning which clearly makes it superior .",
    "figure 2 displays a typical example of type @xmath1 using star v100 . for this star , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the 29 type @xmath2 stars can be summarized on average as follows . using similar nomenclature to that specified for the rr@xmath1 stars above , we have @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 while @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 since @xmath66 gives about as good an approximation as fourier series with 8 terms but with much less bending and fewer parameters , we prefer @xmath66 . comparing @xmath121 to @xmath122 we see that @xmath31 has gone from 0.954 to 0.962 , which means the ratio of errors , @xmath123 : a @xmath124 reduction in error so @xmath66 is clearly superior .",
    "the increase in bending simply means we are twisting more to fit the data - as can be seen especially well in figures 1 to 3 .",
    "figures 1 to 3 are typical examples of the sort of approximations possible with cubic polynomials .",
    "further , figure 3 presents typical examples of type @xmath2 using v57 and v136 .",
    "v57 ( left panel of figure 3 ) is an example ( of 6 or 7 stars ) where the decreasing portion seems to momentarily increase before a final dip to the minimum , while v136 ( right panel of figure 3 ) does not show this behavior .",
    "for v57 we have @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and for v136 we have @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the proportion decreasing using @xmath66 is not the same as @xmath18 ( using @xmath59 ) .",
    "however , it is usually within @xmath137 the period obtained by @xmath59 and @xmath66 are usually within @xmath138 , while they differ from the period using fourier series by perhaps @xmath139 .",
    "worse yet , the optimal period for a fourier series depends on the order of the series",
    ".    there are three stars , listed in table 1 , which have two periods .",
    "these were analyzed as follows .",
    "we removed outliers in the data as before .",
    "we then fit by @xmath59 or @xmath65 depending on type , and removed outliers based on their residuals .",
    "this gave an initial period equal to @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 we then obtained the next period and its power @xmath143 we subsequently refit by @xmath65 if necessary , and then we fit the residuals by another @xmath65 and finally obtained a combined best fit ( with both @xmath60 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , from which we calculated an @xmath36 statistic .",
    "these are all listed in table 1 . for each star ,",
    "the first and second lines correspond to the first ( f606w ) and second ( f814w ) bands , respectively .",
    "the @xmath36 statistic tells us that we are more than @xmath147 certain that the second @xmath65 is significant and so the second period is significant .",
    "a different approach is based on scargle s analysis . using his equation",
    "( 18 ) , if it is possible to select @xmath4 possible periods a priori , then in order to conclude that , with greater than @xmath148 certainty , the best one is valid , the power for more than one must exceed the threshold @xmath149.$ ] however there is no way of knowing in advance what the true period is .",
    "if we assume it lies between 0.250 and 0.800 and round to three decimal places , there are 551 possibilities which gives a threshold of 10.9 .",
    "each of the powers listed in table 1 is above this except for v95 in the second band .",
    "if a second period is present it should be present in each band .",
    "we conducted an extensive search in the first band which has higher amplitude and then checked some periods near the predicted period - the second power was conclusive . for a number of stars , using only one band , we discovered we could obtain a much better approximation using two periods differing by only about 0.001 .",
    "we assume these are anomolies and ignore them though more data might lead to different results .",
    "several stars had significant evidence of a second period in one band but not in the other and these were ignored .",
    "these stringent criteria leave the three stars in table 1 with two periods . in each case",
    "the period ratio is 0.75 .",
    "figure 4 displays a graph of v1 over 4 primary periods which equals 3 secondary periods .",
    "this also presents the interaction of the two periods .",
    "these three stars have primary periods between 0.353 and 0.383 .",
    "recent work has focused on the properties of rr lyraes at minimum light has a possible way to estimate reddening @xcite . the theoretical basis for this has been established by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors showed the importance of period - color ( pc ) relations at maximum light .",
    "cepheids have flatter pc relations at maximum light and definite relation at minimum light such that higher amplitude cepheids are driven to cooler and hence redder colors . in the case of rr lyraes",
    "this is reversed with a flat pc relation at minimum light and a discernable relation at maximum light .",
    "figure 5 presents pc relations at maximum and minimum light for the @xcite data calculated using both fourier series ( open circles ) and cubic polynomials ( solid black squares ) to approximate the data .",
    "firstly , we see broad support for the contention that pc relations at minimum light are much flatter than those at maximum light .",
    "secondly , as pointed out by the referee , we notice somewhat tighter and flatter relations are present for the pc relation at minimum light when using a cubic polynomial fit .",
    "we have found a new way to approximate the light curve of an rr lyrae star by fitting cubic polynomials to the data .",
    "this method can fit the data with fewer parameters than fourier series and suffers virtually no ringing .",
    "it can also estimate periodicities in the data .",
    "when we apply this method to rr lyrae data in the andromeda halo , we find , in addition to the multiperiodic star v90 reported by @xcite , an additional 2 other multiperiodic stars ( v1 and v95 , previously classified as type @xmath91 ) in the data sample : here we require this multiperiodicity to be present in both bands",
