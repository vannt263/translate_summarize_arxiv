    "the sr - ru - o system initially attracted interest because of technological applications as perovskite substrates . in the last few years , however , the unique electronic properties of ruthenates made them objects of interest from the point of view of fundamental solid state physics .",
    "the root compound for this system is the pseudocubic perovskite srruo@xmath3 this material has an orthorhombic pbnm ( gdfeo@xmath4 structure , and is a strong ferromagnet .",
    "it is characterized by unusual transport properties ( so - called `` bad metal '' behavior ) , unusually strong coupling between the spin and charge degrees of freedom , and substantial involvement of oxygen in its magnetic properties .",
    "sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 occurs in a body centered tetragonal k@xmath5nif@xmath6structure and is superconducting at a temperature of 1.5 k. it is generally accepted now that the superconductivity of sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 is unconventional and most likely triplet .",
    "a number of researchers expressed an opinion that ruthenates , or at least some of them , may be strongly correlated systems close to mott - hubbard transition . on the other hand , unlike common strongly correlated materials ( 3d oxides , high-@xmath7 cuprates ) , the physical properties of ruthenates are well described by conventional density functional theory , and their unusual transport properties are likely to be due to strong magnetic interactions and magnetic scattering .",
    "density functional electronic structure calculations have been reported for cubic and orthorhombic srruo@xmath8@xcite and for sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6@xcite , using the general potential linearized augmented plane wave method ( lapw ) .",
    "an analysis of the resulting electronic structure was given in refs .. at the moment , essentially all observable properties which could be reliably calculated from the electronic structure results agree well with the experiment .",
    "on the other hand , there are several properties of this material that can not be reliably obtained directly with the lapw method due to the high computational cost . at the same time",
    ", there is substantial interest among both theorists ( as a starting point for many body models ) and experimentalists in having a simple , fast tight binding model which would accurately describe the lda electronic structure near the fermi level@xcite .",
    "existing tight binding models@xcite do not reproduce accurately enough the details of the fermiology , e.g. the degree of nesting .",
    "for this reason we have performed highly accurate tight - binding parametrizations of this system by fitting to lapw results .",
    "for the cubic srruo@xmath8 we constructed orthogonal tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonians by fitting to the spin - polarized band structure of ref .. we followed a procedure similar to the one used for other oxide perovskites@xcite , based on 14 lapw bands for each of 165 * k*-points in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "our tb hamiltonian results in a 14@xmath914 secular equation based on the d - ru and p - o orbitals .",
    "this hamiltonian contains 11 first and 2 second nearest neighbor slater - koster parameters ( listed in table [ tab1 ] ) for each spin determined by least - squares fitting to the lapw results .",
    "the overall rms error for all 14 bands was 14 mry .",
    "this high level of accuracy is demonstrated in our energy band and densities of states figures discussed in the next section . as can be seen from table [ tab1 ]",
    ", we have included the crystal field splitting @xmath10 on the ru @xmath11-states , which is 3.34 ev ( @xmath12 and 3.23 ev(@xmath13 there is also significant crystal field splitting @xmath14 on the oxygen site , 1.33 ev ( @xmath12 and 1.41 ev(@xmath15 ( a similar effect exists in manganite perovskites , cf . ref . ) .",
    "the exchange splitting for ru is relatively small : 0.57 ev ( @xmath16 and 0.45 ev ( @xmath17 we also have exchange splitting on the o sites ( 0.12 ev for @xmath18 and 0.20 ev for @xmath19 , in accord with the general role of ru - o hybridization in ruthenates , as discussed in ref .. the strongest interactions in the system are ( table [ tab1 ] ) the ru - o @xmath20 and @xmath21 as expected",
    ". we also note that in order to obtain a good fit we had to include the second nearest @xmath22 and @xmath23 interactions .",
    "another observation which can be made from table [ tab1 ] is that the rigid - band stoner picture describes the physics of magnetic splitting rather well : there is hardly any difference between the hopping intergal in the spin up and in the spin down channels .",
    "for sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 , we followed a similar procedure to construct the orthogonal hamiltonian .",
    "the details are as follows .",
    "we fitted to the lapw results of ref . using 18 bands for each of 207 * k*-points in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "the size of our hamiltonian matrix became 27@xmath927 based on the @xmath24sr , @xmath24ru and @xmath25o orbitals .",
    "having in mind applications to superconductivity theory , we aimed at having a virtually perfect fit in the window of @xmath26 ev around the fermi level .",
    "for that inclusion of the @xmath24sr orbitals was unavoidable .",
    "this hamiltonian contains 30 first and 2 second nearest neighbor parameters . since we used an orthogonal tb model , the physical nonorthogonality between d - ru and p - o orbitals ( which have bigger overlaps than other orbitals in the system ) spills over into nonzero second nearest neighbor parameters in an orthogonal hamiltonian , specifically ru - o2 @xmath27 and o1-o2 @xmath22 , as well as into direct hopping integrals between ru ( the fact that the fitted values for ru - ru hopping do not come from actual overlap of the wave functions",
    "is corroborated by the fact that the @xmath28 parameters have a far stronger effect on the band structure than the @xmath29 and @xmath30 ones ) . in our notation o1 and o2",
    "describe the in - plane and apical oxygens , respectively .",
    "the parameters are listed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the overall r.m.s .",
    "error for this fit is @xmath31 mry for all 18 bands and is less than 2 mry for the bands crossing the fermi level ( 13th to 15th ) , for which we used a higher weight in order to reproduce the fermi surface very accurately .",
    "in fig . [ sr3bands ] we show the tb energy bands of cubic srruo@xmath8 for both spin up and spin down .",
    "we note that the tb bands , especially near the fermi level ( @xmath32 ) are almost indistinguishable from the lapw ones . in the ( 100 ) direction we note near @xmath33 a flat band that is occupied for spin - up and above e@xmath34 for spin - down .",
    "we also see a small electron pocket for spin - up and a gap for spin - down centered at @xmath35 .",
    "we observe a hole pocket for spin - down centered at m that vanishes for spin - up . in fig .",
    "[ sr3dos ] we show the tb dos for both spins . in agreement with the lapw results ,",
    "we find a pronounced peak just below @xmath33 for spin - up and just above @xmath33 for spin - down , while dos at @xmath33 is approximately the same for both spins .",
    "both these peaks are a mixture of @xmath36-ru and @xmath37-o states as can be seen from the decomposition of the dos , in accord with the discussion in ref .. on the other hand , the @xmath38 contribution to dos at the fermi level is very small for spin up and nearly zero for the spin down channel .    in fig .",
    "[ sr2bands ] , we show a comparison of tb and lapw energy bands for sr@xmath5ruo@xmath39 .",
    "the bands above 2 ev were not fitted . in the low bands far away from @xmath33 there are minor discrepancies .",
    "however , the bands near @xmath33 display excellent agreement between tb and lapw .",
    "this also results in a virtually perfect match of the fermi surfaces ( fig .",
    "the degree of the nesting of the pseudosquare fermi surface sheets is reproduced very well , which is crucial for the calculations of susceptibilities and response functions ( cf .",
    "ref . ) . also the ( very weak ) @xmath40 dispersion , which manifests itself through small violations of the mirror symmetry in fig .",
    "[ fs ] , is reproduced .",
    "apart from computational efficiency , tb models have another advantage with respect to the first principles methods : electronic velocities , which are usually calculated in the first principles methods by numerical differentiation of electron eigenenergies , can be obtained analytically from the tb hamiltonian without any loss of accuracy : @xmath41 where summation is performed over all neighbors for which hopping integrals were included in the hamiltonian .",
    "the first line follows from the hellman - feynman theorem , and the second from the tb expression for @xmath42 the advantage of using this formula is particularly clear when there are many band crossings in the energy range of interest , in which case numerical differentiation requires an extremely fine mesh .",
    "this is even more true for the physical quantities that depend on an electronic mass ( second derivative of the eigenenergy ) , like hall coefficient .",
    "since the error of numerical differentiation increases rapidly with the order of the calculated derivative , eliminating the second differentiation by using the hellman - feynman velocities is particularly helpful in this case . to illustrate this approach",
    ", we computed a quantity that defines the vortex lattice geometry in superconducting sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6@xcite and depends in a non - trivial way on the electronic velocities .",
    "agterberg@xcite showed that this geometry is directly related to the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "for an isotropic triplet @xmath43-wave pairing , one expects a triangular vortex lattice . for a @xmath11 wave pairing a square lattice appears , oriented either along ( 100 ) or along ( 110 ) directions .",
    "it was observed experimentally@xcite that in sr@xmath44ruo@xmath6 abrikosov vortices form a square lattice ; agterberg@xcite performed calculations for a model of a 2d triplet superconductor , where the angular anisotropy comes entirely from the fermiology .",
    "he derived a criterion that controls the geometry of the vortex lattice : @xmath45 the absolute value of this quantity determines whether the vortex lattice will be triangular or square ( for @xmath46 it is always square ) , while its sign defines the orientation of the lattice when it is square . if @xmath47 it is aligned with the crystal lattice , as it is observed in the experiment .",
    "agterberg pointed out that when order parameters are different for the three bands crossing the fermi level , the actual vortex lattice will be defined by the sign of the weighted @xmath48 parameter , which in turn depends on the order parameters @xmath49 in all three bands , @xmath50 he estimated , using a 3-band tb model of ref .",
    ", that @xmath51 while @xmath52 this calculation is to be taken with a grain of salt , though , as the model used for the band structure is rather approximate . however , if indeed @xmath53 even a modest interband anisotropy of the order parameter such as that computed in refs . could ensure agreement with the experiment .",
    "of course , since eqs .",
    "[ nu],[eff ] involve complicated averages over the fermi surface , the result is very sensitive to the accuracy of the brillouin zone integration .    in fig.[nufig ]",
    "we show the results of our calculation of @xmath54 , using the present tb model , eq.[vel ] , and the tetrahedron integration technique with the 1507 irreducible * k*-points in the brillouin zone .",
    "first , we observe that even with such a fine mesh and relatively simple fermi surface the numerical differentiation of eigenenergies produces noisy curves , compared to the analytical differentiation .",
    "second , we find that there is little dependence of @xmath48 on the fermi energy in the range @xmath55150 mev , although the van hove singularity is located only 70 mev above the fermi energy .",
    "third , we see that the calculated values of @xmath48 ( @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 are not too far from agterberg s estimates .",
    "fourth , we can use eq .",
    "[ nu ] to estimate the lower limit on the ratio @xmath59 assuming @xmath60 in order to reproduce the experimental observation that @xmath61 and using our calculated ratios @xmath62 we find that @xmath63 which is to be compared , for instance , with @xmath642.2 in ref . .",
    "another interesting fermi surface property , which requires highly accurate integration over the brillouin zone , is the hall coefficient .",
    "it depends on the _ second _ derivatives of the eigenvalues ( see appendix ) , which makes numerical differentiation undesirable .",
    "we used our tb fit to calculate the hall coefficient both in diffusive ( eq.[rd ] ) and ballistic(eq.[rb ] ) regimes .",
    "experiments show @xcite that the hall coefficient is negative ( electron - like ) at @xmath65 @xmath66 m@xmath67c , but grows rapidly and changes sign at @xmath68 k , and stays close to zero at the higher temperatures .",
    "it was suggested that this is a manifestation of the different temperature dependence of the relaxation time in different bands@xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may think that at @xmath69 k a crossover between the eq.[rb ] and eq.[rd ] takes place .",
    "we checked these hypotheses by calculating the conductivities @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see appendix ) for all three fermi surface sheets . in both cases",
    "they are calculated up to a common constant factor ( constant relaxation time @xmath72 or constant mean free path @xmath73 ) .",
    "the results were , in atomic units , as given in table [ hall ] .",
    "first of all , we observe that the difference between the two approximations is very small .",
    "second , we see that the net hall conductivity originating from the @xmath74 sheets of the fermi surface ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 , in standard notations ) is electron - like .",
    "thus the mackenzie @xmath77 @xmath78 explanation of the sign change at @xmath69 k requires a substantial difference of the temperature dependence of @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( not only of @xmath81 and @xmath82 which is physically hard to support , considering the origin of these bands .",
    "however , as noted in a previous paper@xcite , to fit the experimental de haas - van alphen extremal area exactly , one has to shift the lda bands by a few mry up ( @xmath83 or down ( @xmath84 in order to investigate this , we applied shifts of 5 , -4 , and -1.5 mry to the bands @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively@xcite this procedure reduces of the energy distance between the van hove singularity and the fermi level from @xmath88 to @xmath89 mev , which makes the difference between the ballistic and the diffusive @xmath70 more pronounced .",
    "the results are shown in table [ shift ] .",
    "one immediately observes that now the net hall conductivity in the bands @xmath90 and @xmath76 is _ positive .",
    "_ thus if the mean free path in those two bands changes with temperature slower than that for the @xmath91 band ( to some extent , in spirit of the `` orbital - dependent '' conjecture of agterberg _",
    "et al_@xcite ) , one may , in principle , expect a sign change of the net hall coefficient .",
    "in fact , one needs to assume that the ratio @xmath92 increases from @xmath93 at @xmath94 to @xmath95 at @xmath96 k to explain the observed sign change .",
    "this would be unusual , but certainly not impossible .",
    "to conclude , we presented highly accurate tight binding fits for cubic srruo@xmath0 and tetragonal sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 perovskites . using nearest neighbor and",
    "a few selected next nearest neighbor hopping parameters we were able to reproduce the first - principles band structure of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 in the physically relevant energy range near the fermi level with the accuracy of a few mry .",
    "this allows for fast generation of the electronic eigenenergies at a superfine mesh in the brillouin zone , and fast and virtually exact calculations of the electronic velocities at the same mesh .",
    "this powerful technique provides a possibility of investigating physical properties with high sensitivity to the details of the band structure and fermi surface topology .",
    "we report two application of the present fit to actual physical problems : first , we calculated the anisotropy parameter @xmath54 relevant for the superconducting vortex lattice geometry , and derived from that the lower bound for the interband anisotropy of the order parameter : to ensure compatibility with the experiment , the order parameter in the @xmath97 band should be at least 20% larger than in the @xmath98 bands .",
    "second , we calculated hall conductivity for the three bands crossing the fermi level , both in the constant - relaxation - time and in the constant - mean - free - path regimes . having these numbers we tested the two most natural hypotheses for the temperature - induced sign reversal of the hall conductivity : crossover between the two above - mentioned regimes and different temperature dependence of the @xmath99 and @xmath100carrier mobility .",
    "we can confidently rule out the former hypothesis .",
    "the latter hypothesis can not be definitely ruled out ; for the fermi surface adjusted to fit the de haas - van alphen cross - section the desired sign reversal can be obtained in the constant - mean - free - path regimes , if the mean free path for the @xmath99carriers changes between o k and 40 k at least four times faster than that for the @xmath100carriers .",
    "a possible reason for such a behavior would be substantially stronger electron - paramagnon coupling for the @xmath99electrons .",
    "we are grateful to d. agterberg for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the office of naval research .",
    "it is convenient to use the 2d expression given by ong@xcite : @xmath101 v_{x}({\\bf k)\\tau } _ { { \\bf k}i } \\\\",
    "\\sigma _ { xx } & = & 2\\frac{e^{2}}{\\hbar \\omega } \\sum_{{\\bf k}i}\\delta ( e_{{\\bf k}% i}-e_{f})v_{x}^{2}({\\bf k)\\tau } _ { { \\bf k}i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which defines the hall coefficient , @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the unit cell volume , and summation is over all bands and all states in the brillouin zone . in the constant - relaxation - time approximation",
    "this reduces to the following expression : @xmath104 ^{2 } ,   \\label{rd}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 etc . as noticed by mackenzie _",
    "et al_@xcite , at very low temperature a more appropriate approximation is where the mean free path , @xmath106 @xmath107 is a constant , in which case we have instead @xmath108 ^{2}.   \\label{rb}\\ ] ]            d.f .",
