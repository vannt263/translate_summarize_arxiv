    "in 1981 , unruh suggested  @xcite that the analogue of black hole radiation could be observed in a quantum fluid that crosses the speed of sound , thereby forming a sonic horizon . since then , several types of fluids and several types of flows were considered  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a near - stationary supersonic flow engendering a pair of horizons ( a black hole one followed by a white hole one ) was realized in a bose ",
    "einstein condensate  @xcite .",
    "in such a background , because of the anomalous dispersion of bogoliubov phonons , one expects to get a kind of laser effect  @xcite@xcite due to a self - amplification of the hawking radiation .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to provide the theoretical basis of this effect starting from the bogoliubov  de gennes equation , i.e. without making use of the gravitational analogy . in this",
    "we apply to flows containing two horizons the treatment of  @xcite that was only applied to a single ( black hole or white hole ) sonic horizon . following  @xcite",
    "we then establish that the laser effect is governed by a discrete set of complex frequency modes that correspond to the resonant modes of the cavity formed by the region bordered by the two horizons . in a classical description ,",
    "this discrete set governs the dynamical instability of the flow .",
    "the second aim is to compute the spectrum of the complex frequency modes by theoretical and numerical methods .",
    "the excellent agreement of the results validates both the concepts and the semi - classical methods used in the theoretical approach .",
    "finally we consider two observables : the mean number of emitted phonons , and the two - point function of the phonon field that governs the density ",
    "density correlation pattern  @xcite . at sufficiently late time , both observables are governed by a single mode , the most unstable one . in this late time regime ,",
    "their behaviours are identical to those one would obtain using a classical description of the density perturbations . at early time instead , when starting from vacuum configurations , correspondence with the quantum phonon flux emitted by a black hole horizon  @xcite is established .",
    "the propagation of phonons in flows containing two horizons has already been considered .",
    "however , toroidal configurations with periodic boundary conditions were generally used  @xcite . in that case",
    ", the spectrum is very complicated because it results from a combination of two effects : the discreteness of the wave vectors defined on the torus interferes with that associated with modes that are trapped in the supersonic region . as a result , not only",
    "the analysis is difficult , but the relationships with the hawking effect and the black hole laser effect  @xcite@xcite are hard to draw . on the contrary ,",
    "when dealing with continuous wave vectors , the analysis of the complex frequency mode is simpler , and the relationship with hawking radiation is easily made .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows . in",
    "we present the bogoliubov  de gennes equation in a way that is suitable for our aims . in",
    "we determine the spectrum of asymptotically bound modes , and explain why complex frequency modes appear when the speed of sound is twice crossed .",
    "we then compute the eigen  frequencies using semi - classical methods . in   we",
    "numerically solve the bogoliubov  de gennes equation and compute the spectrum .",
    "we then evaluate the mean occupation number and compare it with the spectrum one would obtain if only the black hole horizon were present .",
    "we finally evaluate the correlation pattern of the density  density two - point function .",
    "using the analogy  @xcite between the wave equation governing sound propagation in a moving fluid and that governing light propagation in a curved space - time , one can associate an acoustic geometry to the fluid flow . in 1 + 1 dimensions ,",
    "these geometries are of the form  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the flow velocity and @xmath2 the speed of sound . in this language , a black - hole ",
    "white - hole geometry is obtained when @xmath1 crosses twice @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , a sonic horizon is present whenever @xmath1 crosses @xmath2 . assuming that the fluid flows from right to left ( @xmath3 ) , the location @xmath4 of a horizon is given by @xmath5 . in our case",
    ", we set the location of the white hole horizon and that of the black hole respectively to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "these divide the @xmath8-axis in three regions , which we call i on the left of the white horizon ( @xmath9 ) , ii between the two horizons ( @xmath10 ) and iii on the right of the black horizon ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the flow is supersonic in the internal region ii and subsonic otherwise .",
    "the opposite case where the velocity is subsonic inside does not give rise to a laser effect , and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "in the present work , our analysis is restricted to the following stationary profiles : @xmath12 \\tanh^{1/n}\\left[\\left(\\frac{{\\kappa_{\\rm b}}|x - l|}{{{c_{\\rm h}}}d}\\right)^n\\right],\\ ] ] which generalize to two horizons those used in  @xcite .",

    "the metric   is then completely fixed by introducing an extra parameter @xmath22 : @xmath23 , \\\\",

    ", we also assume that the condensate is infinitely long , in order to avoid discussing the discreteness of the longitudinal wave number @xmath49 .",
    "the discrete case is indeed more complicated , and treated in details in  @xcite .",

    "we also introduced @xmath110 which gives the characteristic dispersive scale . when sending @xmath111 , eq : dispersion becomes the relativistic equation @xmath112 since the quartic term drops out .",
    "similarly , eq : modes becomes the euler equation governing sound waves .",
    "instead , when keeping this term , the dispersion relation eq : dispersion possesses four roots , some of which can be complex .",

    "there exists a critical frequency @xmath115 such that the four roots of eq : dispersion are  @xcite    * @xmath116 : all real ; * @xmath117 : two real and two complex ones , as in subsonic flows .",

    "then , we need to identify the number of globally defined independent modes .",
    "it should be noted that this set does not depend on the particular form of the mode equation , but mainly resides on the behaviour in the internal region ii and in the asymptotic flat external regions i and iii described in  .",
    "therefore , the result is the same when studying a phonon field in a bec , as in the present paper , or a generic scalar field with superluminal dispersion relation as in  @xcite . as explained in this reference , in geometries described by  eq : velocity , there is a continuous double set ( right - going and left - going waves ) of real frequency modes , and the discrete set of complex frequency modes is generally not empty .",
    "here we give a more mathematical argument yielding the same result .    in flows",
    "eq : velocity , two asymptotically flat and subsonic regions play the most important role in defining the set of modes , for both @xmath103 real and @xmath103 complex . for @xmath138 real , there are three bounded modes : the two usual propagating modes associated with the real roots of eq : dispersion _ plus _ the mode that asymptotically decays .",

    "let us now move to the complex frequency case . because all expressions are analytic in @xmath103 , the above analysis applies as such when replacing @xmath64 by @xmath163 .",
    "the novel aspects only come through the condition that the modes be asymptotically bound .",
    "indeed , @xmath164 implies that @xmath165 , the asymptotic wave number of the @xmath143 real root of eq : dispersion ( more precisely of its analytical continuation in @xmath166 ) , acquires a positive imaginary part .",
    "thus the mode diverges at @xmath167 , unless one puts @xmath168 .",
    "similarly , on the right side , the @xmath1 mode diverges at @xmath169 , and imposing that it is bound requires @xmath170 .",
    "however , these two conditions imply that the system  eq : system has only the trivial solution @xmath171 , _ except _ when its determinant vanishes .",
    "this condition defines an equation for the complex frequency @xmath103 that has a finite set of solutions : @xmath172 .",
    "having established the condition that defines the complex frequencies @xmath81 , we now turn to the question of calculating them .",
    "since the above algebraic method does not depend on the specific form of the mode equation , the semi - classical treatment of  @xcite applies to the present case .",
    "therefore , we just summarize the results without going into the details .",
    "one should nevertheless pay attention to the fact that one is dealing with modes doublets @xmath173 and to the normalization of these modes .",

    "equations are valid in the three regions i , ii , iii but not close to the horizons where the gradients of @xmath1 and @xmath2 can not be neglected .",
