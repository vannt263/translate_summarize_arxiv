    "when , in two dimensions , does a finsler metric have geodesics which are all circles ? here ` circle ' is used in the mildly generalized sense in which straight lines are considered as circles of infinite radius .",
    "apart from this qualification the word has its usual meaning , so there is an underlying assumption of an euclidean structure :   and in fact we will work in euclidean coordinates in the euclidean plane .",
    "there are several reasons , in addition to pure curiosity , why one might be interested in this question .",
    "it may be considered as a generalized version , or in tabachnikov s words @xcite as a ` magnetic analog ' , of hilbert s fourth problem . or one might be interested in an inverse problem , that is , in the question of whether some particular path space consisting of circles is finsler metrizable .",
    "our motivation originated in a problem of the latter type , the relevant path space being the set of horocycles of a fixed orientation in the poincar disk .",
    "( it is well known that any two - dimensional path space is locally finsler metrizable .",
    "we therefore emphasise that the question here is a global one :  whether there is a finsler function  positive and strictly convex  defined over the whole of the interior of the unit disk , whose geodesics are horocycles . )    we do not attempt to answer the question in all generality , but deal with the special class of finsler metrics consisting of randers metrics for which the riemannian part is conformal to the euclidean metric .",
    "the obvious two - dimensional riemannian spaces whose geodesics are circles belong to this class .",
    "so do the metrics whose geodesics are circles of fixed radius discussed by shen in @xcite , which we have elsewhere @xcite discussed at some length under the name of shen s circles , and which form the standard case of a magnetic flow as discussed in @xcite .",
    "now the transformations of the plane which map circles to circles are the fractional - linear or mbius transformations ; these are also conformal for the euclidean metric , and so this class of finsler functions is mapped to itself by the mbius transformations .",
    "this makes the class a natural one to investigate .",
    "we solve the problem completely for this class of metrics .",
    "our results may be summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be an open subset of the euclidean plane , with euclidean coordinates @xmath1 , and let @xmath2 be the corresponding fibre coordinates on the slit tangent bundle @xmath3 . in order that a finsler metric of randers type whose riemannian part is conformal to the euclidean metric should have only circles as geodesics the riemannian part must be of constant gaussian curvature .",
    "up to a mbius transformation , and up to multiplication by a positive constant and the addition of an arbitrary total derivative , such a finsler metric belongs to one of following three one - parameter families of randers metrics for which the gaussian curvature of the riemannian part is respectively @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 : @xmath7    we discover , among the third of these classes of finsler metrics , one for the horocycles in the poincar disk in each of the two possible orientations . this discovery resolves a minor controversy .",
    "it is known unequivocally ( see @xcite ) that neither of the horocycle flows on a compact surface of constant negative curvature ( obtained as the quotient space of the poincar disk by the action of a suitable discrete group of isometries ) is geodesible :  that is to say , no riemannian metric for such a surface can be found whose geodesic flow has the horocycles ( of either orientation ) as its geodesic paths .",
    "two questions arise :  does this result apply to the horocycle flows for the whole disk , and does it rule out finsler metrizability ?",
    "a paper by sullivan @xcite seems to suggest that it does apply to the whole disk ; moreover , the arguments adduced there apparently rule out finsler metrizability too .",
    "our result shows that in fact each horocycle path space on the disk is finsler metrizable .    also among our finsler metrics",
    "are ones for curves with constant geodesic curvature with respect to the poincar metric , which again are circles :  these are the base integral curves of what arnold @xcite calls ` cyclical flows ' . it was known that cyclical flows are isomorphic to geodesic flows , but so far as we know no explicit metric has been published until now .",
    "we should make it clear that we do not claim that our examples exhaust the possibilities for finsler metrics whose geodesics are circles .",
    "tabachnikov , in @xcite , describes the whole class of metrics whose geodesics are circles all of the same radius .",
    "lvarez paiva and berck , in @xcite , find all reversible finsler metrics on the 2-sphere whose geodesics are circles . in each case",
    "the methods used are different from ours .",
    "our solutions do of course overlap with those of these other authors , in some instances of the first and second cases listed in the theorem above , respectively .    in section 2",
    "we obtain the randers spaces whose geodesics are circles , thus proving the theorem . in section 3",
    "we discuss horocycles .",
    "in section 4 we compute the geodesic curvature of the geodesics of the randers metrics of interest . in section 5",
    "we consider cyclical flows .    we have specified the finsler metrics under consideration as those randers metrics for which the riemannian part is conformal to the euclidean metric . now in two dimensions every riemannian metric is locally conformally flat , so it may be argued that that part of the specification is superfluous :  that we are dealing with randers metrics in two dimensions for which the geodesics are circles when expressed in terms of coordinates for which the riemannian part is a scalar multiple of the euclidean metric .",
    "it seems to us however to be more natural geometrically to state the problem in the original form , that is , to start with the euclidean plane with euclidean coordinates as described above , and insist that the finsler functions in question are of randers type with riemannian part which is a scalar multiple of the euclidean metric in those coordinates .",
    "let @xmath0 be an open subset of the euclidean plane , with euclidean coordinates @xmath1 , and let @xmath2 be the corresponding fibre coordinates on @xmath3 .",
    "the vertical vector fields @xmath8 form a basis for vertical vector fields .",
    "so any spray may be written @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a function on @xmath3 , positively homogeneous of degree 1 in @xmath2 .",
    "here @xmath11 the liouville field .",
    "we wish to determine conditions under which the base integral curves of @xmath12 are circles , considered as oriented paths . that is to say",
    ", we may count as equivalent sprays which differ by a multiple of @xmath13 , or in other words work projectively .",
    "in the first instance , therefore , we may simply ignore the @xmath13 component .",
    "the base integral curves of @xmath12 are then the solutions of @xmath14 along a solution curve @xmath15 is constant , so we may assume parametrization with euclidean arc - length .",
    "but then @xmath10 is just the curvature of the solution curve :  to be more precise , if @xmath16 is a solution curve , @xmath17 is its curvature at the point of parameter value @xmath18 , the unit tangent to the curve at that point being @xmath19 and the unit normals @xmath20 .",
    "now a circle is just a curve of constant curvature :  so the solution curve is a circle if and only if @xmath10 is constant along it .",
    "thus the necessary and sufficient condition for all the base integral curves of @xmath12 to be circles is that @xmath21 , or that @xmath10 satisfies @xmath22    we wish next to use this criterion to determine when the geodesics of a finsler function are circles .",
    "it is perhaps too much to expect to be able to answer this question in all generality , but as we have argued in the introduction there is an obvious class of finsler functions which are of interest , appropriate to the problem , and easy to analyse :  it consists of finsler functions obtained from a conformally - euclidean riemannian metric by a randers change :  that is , finsler functions @xmath23 of the form @xmath24 where we have written the conformal factor , which must be everywhere positive , as @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath23 is positively homogeneous of degree 1 it has a single euler - lagrange equation , which is @xmath26 this equation is satisfied by @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 let us denote the coefficient of @xmath30 by @xmath31 .",
    "then the condition on @xmath10 for the geodesics to be circles becomes @xmath32 thus from the quadratic terms @xmath33 must satisfy the two equations @xmath34 while from the term in @xmath30 it follows that @xmath35 is constant .",
    "the equations that @xmath33 must satisfy turn out to be simplest when expressed in terms of @xmath36 :  they become @xmath37 it follows that all third order partial derivatives of @xmath38 vanish , so @xmath38 is at most quadratic in @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with highest - order term a constant multiple of @xmath41",
    ". then the riemannian part is of constant gaussian curvature ; in fact if @xmath42 the curvature is @xmath43 .",
    "the condition on @xmath44 and @xmath45 is that @xmath46 a constant .",
    "note that if @xmath47 and @xmath48 both satisfy this condition ( with the same @xmath49 ) then @xmath50 so that @xmath51 for some function @xmath52 on @xmath0 :  but @xmath23 is only determined up to a total derivative anyway .",
    "so any one solution @xmath47 is enough . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath47 is a solution with @xmath53 then @xmath54 is a solution with @xmath55 .",
    "in fact with @xmath42 , provided that @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are not all zero , @xmath59 will do for any constants @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 such that @xmath64    by using mbius transformations and the fact that @xmath23 and @xmath65 have the same geodesics for nonzero constant @xmath66 we can obtain canonical forms , up to the addition of total derivatives , for the finsler metrics corresponding to gaussian curvature 0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , as follows . note",
    "first that since @xmath23 and @xmath65 must both be positive we must take @xmath66 to be positive ; so we may assume without loss of generality that the leading term in @xmath38 is @xmath67 , @xmath68 or zero ( i.e.  that @xmath38 is linear ) .",
    "in either of the first two cases we may eliminate the linear terms by a change of origin , and by scaling reduce the quadratic expression to one of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath67 ( the conformal factor can not be everywhere negative ) .",
    "the latter two cases are equivalent to those with @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively , by inversion in the unit circle .",
    "any linear @xmath38 may be reduced to @xmath74 ( by a rotation followed by a scale followed by a translation ) , and any constant @xmath38 to 1 .",
    "moreover , it is well - known that there exists a mbius transformation in the hyperbolic plane which transforms the half - plane model ( with @xmath74 ) into the poincar disk model ( with @xmath72 ) .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath73 , @xmath75 , or @xmath72 .",
    "the first has gaussian curvature @xmath4 of course .",
    "finally we replace the latter two by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , so as to obtain gaussian curvature @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "it is then easily checked that @xmath78 , @xmath79 satisfies the conditions for @xmath44 and @xmath45 above , with @xmath53 , in each case .",
    "we obtain the following classes of canonical forms @xmath80 as stated in the theorem .",
    "each class depends on a single parameter @xmath81 .",
    "we should also determine maximum domains on which @xmath82 is positive and strongly convex :  actually positive is enough , since according to @xcite ( section 11.1 ) , for a randers metric positivity implies strong convexity .",
    "notice that @xmath83 by the cauchy - schwarz inequality .",
    "it follows that the first two finsler functions above are positive on the domain @xmath84 .",
    "the geodesics of the first class are shen s circles and we refer to @xcite and @xcite for further discussions on this metric .",
    "as these references reveal , the situation is complicated by the fact that we may change , and possibly enlarge , domains by adding on total derivatives . for the second case",
    ", the finsler function with @xmath85 corresponds ( up to a factor ) to the metric of the sphere after stereographic projection .",
    "if @xmath86 , i.e.  when the finsler function is non - reversible , the metrics can not be extended to the whole sphere .",
    "this is indeed to be expected in the light of the following result , which can be derived from @xcite :  any finsler metric ( not necessarily of randers type ) defined on the whole sphere , all of whose geodesics are circles , is the sum of a reversible metric and a total derivative .",
    "we shall discuss the third class of metrics in more detail in the sections that follow .",
    "as we pointed out earlier , one interesting example consists of the horocycles .    in the poincar disk model of the hyperbolic plane , the horocycles are represented by circles tangent to the boundary circle .",
    "so let us take the closed unit disk @xmath87 centred at the origin in @xmath88 , with interior @xmath89 and boundary the unit circle @xmath90 , and consider all circles whose centres lie in @xmath89 and which touch @xmath90 . actually , the set of such circles does not define a path space :  one has first to choose an orientation ( otherwise there are two circles through any given point in @xmath89 with given tangent vector ) .",
    "we choose the anticlockwise orientation .",
    "consider a circle through a point @xmath91 , with ( non - zero ) tangent vector @xmath92 there .",
    "its centre @xmath93 lies on the normal , so @xmath94 , @xmath95 , with @xmath96 to get the orientation right .",
    "for this circle to touch @xmath90 its radius @xmath97 must satisfy @xmath98 . the equation of the horocycle through @xmath99 with tangent @xmath92 is thus @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 from which @xmath104 since @xmath91 the argument of the previous section involving the cauchy - schwarz inequality implies that @xmath105 is well - defined and positive .",
    "we shall show that @xmath106 is a finsler function on @xmath107 whose geodesics are the horocycles .",
    "notice that @xmath108 ; thus @xmath23 is positive on @xmath107 , so it is a finsler function there .",
    "it belongs to the class of finsler functions discussed in the previous section whose geodesics are circles , and whose riemannian part has gaussian curvature @xmath6 ; we shall show that its geodesics are the anticlockwise - oriented horocycles .    in this case , somewhat remarkably , @xmath109 .",
    "the geodesics are thus the solutions of @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath112 , @xmath113 , with @xmath114 ; or in other words @xmath115 thus @xmath116 since without loss of generality we may take @xmath117 .",
    "this base integral path is a circle with centre @xmath93 and radius @xmath105 .",
    "finally , we show that @xmath118 , and @xmath119 ; in fact the first follows from the second .",
    "it follows easily from the definitions of @xmath105 ( with @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 and @xmath122 that @xmath123 .",
    "but by the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath124 , and therefore @xmath119 as required .    in principle our calculations determine only the projective class of @xmath12 :  but @xmath125 as we showed earlier , so @xmath12 is in fact the geodesic spray of @xmath23 .",
    "the geodesics of the finsler function @xmath126 are the horocycles with clockwise orientation .",
    "the finsler metric @xmath23 for the horocycles has constant flag curvature ; but somewhat unexpectedly its flag curvature is 1 rather than @xmath6 . since @xmath23 is a randers metric we can use the zermelo navigation data to carry out the calculation .",
    "the method is described by bao and robles in @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "we follow their notation . the zermelo navigation data for @xmath23 consist of a riemannian metric @xmath127 and a vector field @xmath128 on @xmath89 .",
    "using the formulas given in section 3.1.2 of @xcite we find that @xmath129 while @xmath130 now @xmath127 is the metric of a hemisphere , obtained by parallel projection of the upper unit hemisphere in @xmath131 , given by @xmath132 , along the @xmath133-axis onto @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , @xmath128 is the generator of rotations about the origin in @xmath88 , so it is an infinitesimal isometry of @xmath127 .",
    "it then follows from theorem  10 of @xcite that @xmath23 has constant flag curvature equal to the gaussian curvature of @xmath127 , which is 1 .",
    "consider again the finsler function @xmath134 one of the conditions we derived earlier for the geodesics of @xmath23 to be circles is that @xmath135 is constant .",
    "let us denote the expression displayed above by @xmath136 .",
    "we shall show that for any @xmath23 of this form and for any geodesic path of @xmath23 , @xmath136 is its geodesic curvature with respect to the riemannian part of @xmath23 .    for any @xmath23 of this form",
    "let us denote its riemannian part @xmath137 by @xmath138 .",
    "any spray @xmath12 of @xmath23 is given by @xmath139 for some @xmath140 , where @xmath141 say .",
    "furthermore , let us choose @xmath140 such that @xmath142 , so that the base integral curves of @xmath12 are parametrized proportionally to the riemannian arc - length .",
    "this requires just that @xmath143 from which it is clear that , with this choice of parametrization , @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the geodesic spray of the riemannian part of @xmath23 .",
    "let us write @xmath146 for the operation of covariant differentiation along a curve parametrized by @xmath18 with respect to the levi - civita connection of the riemannian metric .",
    "then any base integral curve of the spray @xmath12 ( with the chosen value of @xmath140 ) , parametrized with riemannian arc - length so that @xmath147 along it , satisfies @xmath148 it is clear that @xmath149 is a unit normal field along the curve .",
    "thus @xmath136 is the geodesic curvature of the base integral curve with respect to the riemannian part of @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath136 is a function on the base @xmath0 the geodesics of the finsler functions @xmath23 under consideration have the interesting property that their geodesic curvatures depend on position only : at each point @xmath150 all geodesics of @xmath23 through @xmath1 have the same geodesic curvature @xmath151 there . the flow on @xmath3 of the corresponding spray @xmath12 ( normalized so that @xmath142 ) is accordingly called by arnold , in @xcite , an isotropic flow .",
    "remark that when @xmath136 is constant the base integral curves of @xmath12 are ` riemannian ' circles ( in the sense of e.g.  @xcite ) , for the riemannian metric given by @xmath138 .",
    "consider next the 1-form @xmath152 .",
    "we have @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the area 2-form of the riemannian part of @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath66 be a piecewise - smooth closed curve in @xmath0 which bounds a region @xmath155 :  then @xmath156 suppose that @xmath136 is constant , as it is for those finsler functions @xmath23 whose geodesics are circles ; suppose that it is nonzero ; then by scaling @xmath44 and @xmath45 we may take @xmath157 .",
    "then the area of @xmath155 is just @xmath158 .",
    "this observation is relevant to the so - called isoperimetric problem for the riemannian manifold with metric @xmath138 , that is , the problem of minimising the length of the perimeter , @xmath159 , of the region while fixing its area . by the method of the lagrange multiplier a curve @xmath66",
    "is a solution curve for this isoperimetric problem if it satisfies the euler - lagrange equations for the lagrangian @xmath160 ( @xmath81 being the multiplier ) .",
    "that is , solutions of the isoperimetric problem ( if any exist ) are closed curves which are geodesics of @xmath161 ; the value of @xmath81 is determined by the requirement that the area enclosed by @xmath66 ( as measured with @xmath154 ) takes the specified value .",
    "in particular , we obtain the known results that the solutions to the isoperimetric problem for arbitrary @xmath138 have constant geodesic curvature , and that the solutions for surfaces of constant curvature are circles .",
    "in fact we can generalize the problem slightly , by using @xmath23 to measure the perimeter rather than @xmath138 , since ( for constant @xmath136 ) the difference between the two perimeters @xmath159 and @xmath162 is just a constant multiple of the area enclosed , which is assumed fixed .",
    "this discussion complements a solution by bryant to a problem posted recently by lvarez paiva in an online discussion forum @xcite .",
    "we consider now @xmath163 where @xmath81 is a constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath164 for this function takes the ( constant ) value @xmath81 :  its geodesics are therefore circles .",
    "if we set @xmath85 we get the geodesics of the poincar disk , if we set @xmath165 or @xmath166 we get horocycles ; the configurations for other values of @xmath81 interpolate between , and extend beyond , these . now in order that @xmath167 we must have @xmath168 .",
    "thus for @xmath169 , @xmath82 is a well - defined finsler metric ( positive and strictly convex ) over the whole of the open unit disk @xmath89 .",
    "but for @xmath170 @xmath82 is a finsler metric only on a smaller domain .",
    "it is however what we have elsewhere @xcite called a pseudo - finsler function ; in particular , its geodesics are still well - defined , and are circles .",
    "the possibilities are illustrated in the following figures .",
    "each of the plots show geodesics through the same initial point and with the same initial direction , but for different choices for the parameter @xmath81 .",
    "the black circles represent either horocycles ( @xmath171 ) or riemannian geodesics ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "the grey circles outside the horocycles correspond to finsler geodesics with parameter values @xmath173 , while those inside the horocycles correspond to @xmath170 .       by the calculation in the previous section",
    "the geodesic curvature of the integral curves of the geodesic spray of the finsler function @xmath82 , viewed as curves on the poincar disk , is just @xmath81 .",
    "we are therefore in the case of what arnold calls cyclical flows ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "theorem 2 of arnold s paper states that if @xmath174 the corresponding flow is ` isomorphic to a geodesic flow ' :   we have exhibited a finsler function of which it is the geodesic flow .",
    "let us be a little more precise .",
    "the finsler function @xmath82 determines a _ riemannian _ metric on @xmath3 , its so - called sasaki lift .",
    "the flow of @xmath175 is a geodesic flow of this metric , and is therefore a riemannian geodesic flow .",
    "fuller details may be inferred from a discussion of geodesibility in @xcite .",
    "each geodesic of @xmath82 , for fixed @xmath81 , has constant curvature in the ordinary sense , that is , constant geodesic curvature with respect to the euclidean metric , but different geodesics have different curvatures .",
    "each geodesic also has constant geodesic curvature with respect to the poincar metric , but now all geodesics have the same curvature",
    ". it may be shown ( again by making use of zermelo navigation ) that @xmath176 are the only cases where @xmath82 is of constant flag curvature .",
    "we are most grateful to juan - carlos alvarez paiva for a number of observations , both helpful and challenging , and in particular for bringing the problem of finding a finsler metric for the horocycle path space to our attention ; and to david saunders for his encouragement .",
