    "provided that the length scale of nonhomogeneities in the mixture is small compared with electromagnetic wavelengths in both component materials m08 , the mixture can be treated as a homogenized composite material ( hcm ) .",
    "the familiar formalisms named in honour of maxwell garnett mg , smith , niklasson and bruggeman brugge , goncharenko provide a means of estimating the relative permittivity of the hcm .",
    "these formalisms are well  established for dissipative hcms arising from component materials for which the real parts of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have the same sign l96 .",
    "however , we recently demonstrated that these formalisms give rise to estimates of the hcm s relative permittivity which are not physically plausible if the component materials are weakly dissipative and the real parts of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have different signs ml04,m07 .",

    ", we consider whether these limitations on conventional homogenization formalisms also extend to active hcms .",
    "this topic is particularly timely , given the current huge interest in metamaterials    many of which can be viewed as hcms m05 . while certain metamaterials can be engineered to exhibit negative refraction , the issue of dissipation presents a major barrier to their practical implementation . in order to overcome inherent dissipation , negatively refracting metamaterials containing active components",

    "we base our investigation on the metal  wire / quantum  dot composite material proposed by bratkovsky _",
    "bratkovsky . that is",
    ", we consider a three  component composite material comprising silver nanorods inserted into an array of inas / gaas quantum dots , with the assembly being immersed in a host dielectric material .",
    "the silver nanorods are aligned with the cartesian @xmath5 axis , while the quantum dots are presumed to be spherical particles . the particles which comprise the host dielectric material",
    "are assigned a spherical shape in the implementation of the bruggeman homogenization formalism .",
    "in contrast , no microstructure is assigned to the host dielectric medium in the implementation of the maxwell garnett homogenization formalism .",

    "we see that @xmath28 which indicates the quantum dots are active entities , particularly so at the resonance centred on @xmath29 @xmath27 m .",
    "from the point of view of the applicability of homogenization formalisms , there are two key points to notice : ( i ) the quantity @xmath30 is negative over the entire wavelength range considered ; and ( ii ) we have @xmath31 for @xmath32 @xmath27 m , and @xmath33 for @xmath34 @xmath27 m where @xmath35 specifies a sharp resonance region centred on @xmath36 @xmath27 m .",
    "by analogy with dissipative hcms ml04,m07,dml07 , points ( i ) and ( ii ) suggest that the application of homogenization formalisms may be problematic .",
    "the hcm is characterized by the relative permittivity dyadic @xmath37 we write ` mg ' or ` br ' in lieu of ` hcm ' according to whether the maxwell garnett or the bruggeman estimate of @xmath38 is being considered .",
    "the anisotropy of the hcm arises due to the orientation of silver nanorods .",
    "the maxwell garnett estimate of the relative permittivity dyadic is given explicitly by ml_pio @xmath39 wherein the polarizability density dyadics @xmath40 and the depolarization dyadics wm_02",

    "let us begin by considering the maxwell garnett and bruggeman estimates for an active hcm when the parameter @xmath53 is positive .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the composite material comprises only quantum dots and the host dielectric material , and the resulting hcm is an isotropic dielectric material with relative permittivity dyadic @xmath55 .",
    "estimates of the hcm relative permittivity computed using the maxwell garnett formalism and the bruggeman formalism , namely @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , are plotted against @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , when @xmath59 .",
    "the maxwell garnett and bruggeman estimates are similar , both qualitatively and quantitatively . for both formalisms ,",
    "the hcm is active across the entire wavelength range considered , and its permittivity scalar exhibits a sharp resonance at @xmath60 @xmath27 m .",
    "therefore , we infer that both the maxwell garnett and the bruggeman formalisms are suitable for active hcms with @xmath61 .",
    "next we turn to the @xmath62 regime which is known to be problematic for dissipative hcms ml04,m07,dml07 . in keeping with bratkovsky _",
    "bratkovsky , we fix @xmath63 and @xmath59 ; thus , @xmath10 is slightly reduced from its value for fig .",

    "[ br_mg_ag_fig ] are qualitatively similar , there are substantial quantitative differences .",
    "in particular , the imaginary part of @xmath64 is more than 20 times larger than @xmath65 , apart from at the small resonance region centred on @xmath60 @xmath27 m . there are also substantial differences between re @xmath64 and re @xmath65 . by comparison ,",
    "the differences between @xmath66 and @xmath67 are relatively small .    for dissipative hcms ,",
    "the problematic nature of the @xmath62 regime is exacerbated as the imaginary parts of the constitutive parameters tend towards zero ml04,m07,dml07 . in order to investigate this issue for active hcms",
    ", we repeated the computations of fig .",
    "[ br_mg_ag_fig ] with @xmath68 and @xmath69 multiplied by @xmath70 .",
    "the corresponding plots of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath71 are presented in fig .",
    "[ br_mg_ag_fig2 ] .",
    "the differences between the maxwell garnett estimates and the bruggeman estimates are now enormous , especially between the imaginary parts of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "our numerical studies reveal that the well  known homogenization formalisms named after maxwell garnett and bruggeman appear to be fairly consistent , and provide physically plausible estimates , when applied to active isotropic dielectric hcms , provided that the real parts of the relative permittivities of the component materials have the same sign .",
    "in contrast , if the real parts of the permittivities of the component materials have different signs then there are substantial differences between the estimates yielded by the two formalisms .",
    "these differences become enormous in the limiting case in which the imaginary parts of the relative permittivities of the component materials become vanishingly small .    for the particular homogenization scenario considered here , in the @xmath62 with @xmath72 regime ,",
    "the hcm permittivity parameters estimated using the bruggeman formalism have relatively large positive  valued imaginary parts away from the resonance region centred on @xmath60 @xmath27 m , and relatively large negative  valued imaginary parts at the resonance region centred on @xmath60 @xmath27 m .",
    "this is not physically plausible since it implies that the hcm is a strongly active material at the resonance region , and a strongly dissipative material away from the resonance region , in the limit wherein the component materials become inactive and nondissipative .",
    "let us note that bruggeman formalism arises as the lowest ",
    "order formulation of the strong  permittivity  fluctuation theory ( spft ) k81 .",
    "accordingly , higher  order implementations of the spft are also subject to the limitations of the bruggeman formalism . furthermore , since the maxwell garnett and bruggeman formalisms share a common provenance aspnes , doubt is also cast over the applicability of the maxwell garnett formalism for active hcms with @xmath73 where the imaginary parts of the relative permittivities of the component materials are relatively small .",
    "the present study extends and reinforces our previous studies which highlighted the limitations of conventional homogenization formalisms when applied to scenarios wherein the real parts of the constitutive parameters characterizing the component materials have different signs ml04,m07,dml07 .",
