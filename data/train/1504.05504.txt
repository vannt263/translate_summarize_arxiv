    "diffusion of particles drifted in inhomogeneous materials by external forces manifests itself on large distances and hence it is a macroscopic phenomenon .",
    "that is why it would be treated mostly classically by means of the diffusion equation or variants of the boltzmann transport equation.@xcite observed deviations from the behavior predicted by the boltzmann equation are of quantum origin . to explain them we have to develop a microscopic quantum theory of diffusion where elementary objects are waves .",
    "their diffusion is caused by wave scatterings on irregularly distributed impurities in otherwise regular environment .",
    "possible interference of waves makes the qualitative difference between the classical and quantum diffusion .",
    "a theory of multiple scatterings of waves on a random potential was introduced by lax.@xcite the theoretical framework for the microscopic description of quantum transport and diffusion was set by the linear - response theory of kubo.@xcite the interest in microscopic diffusion of quantum particles in disordered systems was boosted by p. w. anderson who discovered that charge diffusion due to multiple electron scatterings on randomly distributed impurities can vanish if the strength of the random potential is sufficiently large.@xcite the full understanding of the anderson localization transition , that is , the transition from diffusive to insulating phase , is still elusive.@xcite    there are two major streams in the study of suppression and eventual vanishing of diffusion : finite - cluster numerical simulations@xcite and ( semi-)analytic approaches in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite unfortunately , agreement between the results and conclusions of the numerical simulations and the analytic theories are not yet fully satisfactory .",
    "each approach has its advantages and drawbacks .",
    "the numerical simulations give rather accurate values of the boundary of the localized phase and of the critical exponents , their results need , however , to be appropriately scaled to get rid of finite - size effects .",
    "the theoretical approaches in the thermodynamic limit directly access thermodynamically relevant quantities , but suffer from the fact that only homogeneous quantities are available and some of the relevant questions can not be addressed .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical approaches to quantum transport work well either in the metallic regime , far from the localization transition , or just in the critical region of the transition .",
    "perturbation , diagrammatic expansions in powers of the random potential formulated in the language of the averaged green functions have been used to describe the metallic phase.@xcite transformations to effective solvable models then address long - range fluctuations and the critical behavior of correlation and response functions at the anderson localization transition in the strong - disorder limit.@xcite neither of these approaches can smoothly be extended to the opposite limit .",
    "the diagrammatic approach works well for one - electron functions and for equilibrium thermodynamic properties but even its self - consistent extension fails to incorporate adequately vertex corrections to the semiclassical drude expression for the electrical conductivity.@xcite the latter construction does not cover adequately the non - universal and non - critical properties of the disordered systems away from the localization transition.@xcite it is the diagrammatic approach that is fully microscopic and has the potential to offer a fully consistent first - principles theory of quantum diffusion .",
    "there are presently two diagrammatic approaches to the microscopic description of quantum diffusion aiming at covering both metallic and insulating phases .",
    "it is the self - consistent theory of anderson localization of vollhardt and wlfle@xcite and the parquet approach of the present authors.@xcite the common quality of both approaches is a two - particle self - consistency used to describe the anderson localization transition.@xcite they differ , however , in the way this self - consistency is used .",
    "the former approach uses the framework delimited by the ward identity and introduces a self - consistent equation for the diffusion constant governing the long - range fluctuations of the singular part of the electron - hole correlation function .",
    "macroscopic conservation laws are obeyed in this approach .",
    "a systematic and controllable way of improving the self - consistent equation for the diffusion constant is , however , missing .",
    "the latter approach allows one to develop controllable approximations for the two - particle vertices including two - particle self - consistency , but it is unable to reconcile the calculated vertex with the ward identity and macroscopic conservation laws .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a systematic and analytically controllable diagrammatic description of diffusive transport in models of non - interacting electrons scattered on randomly distributed impurities .",
    "the non - local two - particle scattering processes calculated in the full two - particle state space lead to vertices and green functions that generically do not comply with the ward identity and hence do not constitute a conserving theory.@xcite to arrive at a conserving approximation , the two - particle irreducible vertex from the diagrammatic construction is only an auxiliary function from which the physical one is appropriately constructed .",
    "we show how to make diagrammatic theories conserving and how to restore the ward identity in approximate treatments .",
    "the physical irreducible vertex obeying the ward identity is then used in a bethe - salpeter equation to determine the physical two - particle functions from which all measurable quantities are determined .",
    "thereby , the construction of the two - particle functions becomes fully consistent and the relevant macroscopic thermodynamic relations in the diffusive regime hold.@xcite we further derive an exact form of the diffusion pole and of the diffusion constant and apply them to derive leading non - local corrections to the mean - field diffusion constant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the model , notation and basic relations in sec .",

    "we derive in sec .",
    "iv a low - energy singularity in the full two - particle vertex and with the aid of the dynamical ward identity also the diffusion pole in the electron - hole correlation function .",
    "the exact form of the static diffusion constant and its approximate form including maximally crossed diagrams are presented in sec . v. section vi brings concluding discussion .",
    "we will consider a noninteracting lattice electron gas scattered on random impurities described by the anderson tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a local , site - independent random potential .",
    "we assume validity of the ergodic theorem leading to the existence of the thermodynamic limit , in which all quantities are homogeneous , configurationally averaged .",
    "we use the standard diagrammatic representation of the scattering processes.@xcite the state space is a hilbert space spanned over the bloch waves @xmath2 with energy @xmath3 and wave vectors @xmath4 from the first brillouin zone .",

    "the electron - hole correlation function contains , however , only a reduced information and is not an integral part of the perturbation theory .",
    "it is the two - particle green function @xmath20 that comes out of the two - particle perturbation ( diagrammatic ) theory .",
    "it is the primary objective of the perturbation theory of quantum diffusion to identify the scattering events contributing to @xmath20 relevant for recovering the singular low - energy asymptotics of the electron - hole correlation function @xmath21 .    to determine the two - particle green function one has to sum contributions from multiple scatterings to the one- and two - particle functions .",
    "to do so effectively one introduces the concept of irreducibility that is best defined diagrammatically .",
    "the one - particle irreducibility is uniquely defined and means that cutting a single one - electron propagator does not disconnect the diagram .",
    "the contribution from all one - particle irreducible diagrams is contained in the self - energy @xmath22 that renormalizes the one - electron propagator via the dyson equation .",
    "the two - particle irreducibility is , however , ambiguous and demands distinction between local and nonlocal scatterings.@xcite here we do not go into these subtle details of the two - particle perturbation theory .",
    "we introduce only the vertex functions that are necessary for the determination of the electron - hole correlation function .",

    "perturbation theory of quantum diffusion has to address simultaneously both one- and two - particle irreducible functions , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we demonstrated in our earlier publications that it is generally impossible to guarantee validity of the dynamical ward identity in the perturbation expansion if we go beyond the local mean - field approximation of the irreducible functions , since it is in conflict with causality of the self - energy.@xcite it means that eq .   is generally not obeyed in its full extent .",
    "a digression from the ward identity is a universal feature of any expansion around the local mean - field solution .",
    "the problem is that the ward identity dynamically restricts the correlated movement of two particles in an uncontrollable way.@xcite ward identity in noninteracting system is not a consequence of a microscopic symmetry transformation , since the one- and two - particle functions are not dynamically coupled .",
    "there is hence no microscopic law forcing the ward identity in random noninteracting systems be strictly obeyed in virtual processes represented by individual scattering events . to make the perturbation expansion accomplishable",
