    "there are multiple indications pointing toward a model containing cold dark matter ( dm ) as the best explanation for the universe we see at different scales .",
    "in particular , the importance of the dark sector component of matter on stellar scales has been less extensively studied and has mainly focused on the sun , planets , white dwarfs @xcite and compact stars @xcite .",
    "this is due to the expected moderate capability of gravitational accretion by these individual celestial bodies from an existing dm galactic distribution .",
    "although the current situation of dm search has greatly benefited from a world - wide experimental effort , at the present time there still remains a relatively vast dm phase space to explore .",
    "regarding possible values for dm particle masses within the weak interaction sector ( _ wimp _ scenario ) , most popular candidates range from the sub - gev region up to @xmath1 100 tev .",
    "as for the interaction cross sections with nuclear matter ( i.e. nucleons , @xmath2 ) , there are at least five orders of magnitude in the @xmath1 gev mass range remaining to be fully tested , namely @xmath3-@xmath4 @xmath5 as quoted by direct detection searches @xcite .    apart from this , concerning the nature of the dm particle , in the case of a majorana candidate , the expected _ indirect _ signal involving gamma - rays or neutrino final products is still under debate @xcite . in this same direction",
    "we may cite other astrophysical effects such as the modification of the emissivity of standard model neutrinos from solar reaction chains that have been recently claimed @xcite . in the case of asymmetric candidates ,",
    "accretion of dm mass beyond a critical value , i.e. the chandrasekhar mass , could induce a dramatic fate for the star where dm accumulates over time @xcite and eventually collapses to a black hole .",
    "another catastrophic event could be triggered following compact object formation via dm seeding . in case of a majorana candidate and if present",
    ", it could induce spark formation energetic enough to nucleate stable bubbles of deconfined quark matter leading to a softening of the nucleon equation of state .",
    "this would drive a neutron star to quark star conversion @xcite .",
    "in addition , unstable dm can also be constrained by structural stability of accreting objects @xcite .",
    "however , aside a pure particle physics description , from the thermodynamical point of view , average magnitudes incorporating the effect of a novel dark sector could be , in principle , determined by evaluating the interplay of both types of matter in a common environment .",
    "typically , the possible dark self - interaction effects are expected to be small as long as the numbers of dm particles remain tiny at all times with respect to the baryons and @xmath6 .",
    "this could be important , however , for a precise determination of the critical masses capable of being sustained in a star @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , for a given candidate , @xmath7 determines the relative fraction of dm to be captured by a compact - sized ( spherical ) object of mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath9 .",
    "once inside it is believed to diffuse toward the denser central stellar regions at a local temperature @xmath10 , being @xmath11 the radial coordinate , according to the exponential law @xmath12 involving the gravitational potential @xmath13 @xcite . as an order of magnitude estimate , the mean free path of a dm particle , @xmath14 ,",
    "is usually quoted as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ordinary nucleon number density .",
    "this is usually considered being sufficient to obtain knowledge about the most efficient opaque environments to wimp dm .",
    "for example , a dense nuclear medium such as the central core in a neutron star ( with a content @xmath17 neutrons ) , exhibits densities well in excess nuclear saturation density @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that in - medium effects are mostly absent from the previous rough estimate .",
    "let us briefly comment on some of the missing corrections . to begin with , fermi - blocking due to partial restriction of the outgoing nucleon phase space can play a role diminishing the @xmath20 cross section .",
    "finite temperature effects will additionally allow the population of higher energy states in the nucleon sector with respect to the vanishing temperature case .",
    "let us remind here that temperatures in the range @xmath21 mev are usually achieved in the very early stages of proto - neutron star evolution @xcite .",
    "later , after a primary neutrino cooling era , the temperatures fall to @xmath1 kev range .",
    "this will set effectively at large times a @xmath22 configuration , as thermal energies are indeed much smaller than nucleon fermi energies @xmath23 .",
    "current phenomenological models involving effective field theories to describe the coupling terms between dm and nucleons are deeply connected to experimental searches , each in a selected center - of - mass energy range , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 mandelstam variable ) . in direct detection searches , for example , a non - relativistic incoming @xmath26 particle with low maxwellian velocity , @xmath27 is considered .",
    "this effectively sets a @xmath28 gev scale .",
    "however , for increasing @xmath28 tev , collider searches can constrain the high energy part of the interaction as particles are relativistic @xmath29 . in particular ,",
    "scalar ( d1 ) , vector ( d5 ) and pseudoscalar couplings can play a crucial role as seen in @xcite .",
    "all the quoted interactions have been largely explored in very low density or vacuum conditions . to test increasing @xmath24 ranges , natural sources of acceleration",
    "can be provided by the gravitational boosting near compact stars . in this way",
    "( neutral ) dm particles can acquire large velocities @xmath30 and scatter very dense macroscopic regions of size nearly the radius of the star @xmath31 km .",
    "this extent has so far only been marginally explored @xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus on the impact of the relativistic contribution of scalar and vector @xmath32 couplings to the spin - independent ( si ) diffusion of dm inside a dense and hot nuclear medium .",
    "the structure of this contribution is as follows .",
    "in section ii we present the effective field theory lagrangian model using dark matter - nucleon contact interaction via scalar and vector couplings in a relativistic framework .",
    "later , we compute the doubly differential and integrated @xmath32 cross sections at finite nucleon chemical potential and temperature . especially we focus on the resulting diffusive behavior of dm particles in the effective weakly interacting strength of the order of fermi s constant , @xmath33 . in this way we can discuss the results in order to compare to other popular weak probes such as standard model neutrinos . in section iii",
    "we discuss about the obtained dependencies presenting the figures for selected cases .",
    "finally , in section iv we conclude .",
    "we consider a fermionic dark matter particle of dirac type , @xmath26 , with scalar and vector couplings to the nucleon field @xmath2 ( protons and neutrons ) .",
    "we can write the interaction lagrangian under the form @xmath34    where @xmath35 are the dirac matrices and @xmath36 are the scalar and vector coupling constants , respectively .",
    "this interaction is equivalent to considering a fermi four - fermion weak interaction model , where the effective couplings of mass dimension @xmath37 for these operators are obtained by integrating out the propagator of a generic @xmath38 mediator with mass @xmath39 and coupling strength @xmath40 at low momentum transfer .",
    "this treatment is already used in direct detection at low energies with non - relativistic effective field theory operators as shown in @xcite . typically , elastic scattering ( rather than inelastic )",
    "is considered as it is the case relevant for direct detection .",
    "generically , operators containing two fermionic dark matter fields can be categorized as shown in table 1 in @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "we will focus on those labeled d1 and d5 , both contributing to the si interaction .",
    "usually , the incoming dm particle is supposed to be thermalized in the galaxy with the maxwellian mean velocities @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "however , in the scenario we consider of an accreting dense star ( typically with the mass and dimensions of a neutron star ) , general relativistic effects are non negligible and are capable of providing a sizeable gravitational boost to the incoming dm particle that can be estimated as follows . the incoming momentum will be obtained from the composition of the radial and azimuthal components .",
    "we have selected a trajectory plane using @xmath43 for the sake of simplicity . at distance @xmath11 from the star",
    "the radial velocity component is @xmath44 and the azimuthal component is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the angular momentum per unit mass for the incoming dm particle .",
    "let us consider , in order to be concrete , a canonical neutron star of mass @xmath47 and radius @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "expliciting the ratio used as unity , @xmath50 , the velocity modulus at the star surface is given by @xmath51 yielding a minimum lorentz factor at the surface @xmath52 .",
    "if scattering happens well inside the core the previous value is a lower limit @xmath53 .",
    "the associated wavelength of the incoming dm particle is @xmath54 .",
    "this sets in practice a limit of validity to our calculation in the dm mass range @xmath55 gev .",
    "although further modelization is required for the inner hadron structure , the use of nuclear form - factors can somewhat mitigate the short - range correlations as we will see later in the manuscript .",
    "in order to calculate the differential cross section per unit volume for the dm - nucleon scattering we use the interaction terms appearing in the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) . the expression can be written as    @xmath56    we denote @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) as the four - momentum for the outgoing ( incoming ) nucleon of effective mass @xmath59 while @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is the analogous for the dm particle of mass @xmath62 .",
    "momentum transfer is denoted by @xmath63 . in this way",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the four - dimensional delta assures the conservation of momentum and energy in the collision .",
    "the factor @xmath66 accounts for the fermi blocking term that takes into account the occupation of states and in our calculation affects only to the the nucleon sector ( protons or neutrons ) @xmath67 with @xmath68 @xmath69p , n .",
    "@xmath70 is the effective nucleon chemical potential for a particle with isospin of ith - type .",
    "effective values of nucleon mass and chemical potential define the _ quasi - particle _ nature of the nucleon in the medium and differ from the nude values by the presence of average meson fields . in this work",
    "we will consider this correction as obtained in the existing literature and refer for further reading to , for example , @xcite .",
    "for the dark sector we will assume that @xmath71 since the fraction of dm inside the star remains tiny at all times .",
    "the validity of this approximation is given by the estimate of dm particles inside the object as @xmath72 .",
    "using @xmath73 @xcite and the number of nucleons in the star @xmath74 we obtain @xmath75 for an old neutron star with a lifetime @xmath76 yr .",
    "we will assume a cross section @xmath77 , larger than the geometrical cross section @xmath78 @xmath79 so the star can effectively scatter and capture dm .",
    "besides this , dm population in the ns ( after the supernova explosion ) should not be negligible since the massive progenitor @xmath80 can be efficient in the dm accretion process @xcite .",
    "then @xmath81 for an environment with ambient dm density @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "let us rewrite the previous expression , eq .",
    "( [ dsigma1 ] ) , using a dispersion angle @xmath84 for the outgoing dm particle . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "this follows from @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "finally , we obtain after a trivial partial integration , @xmath89    in this calculation we will restrict ourselves to temperatures and densities typical for the thermodynamical evolution of the stellar core region , that is @xmath90 mev and @xmath91 . due to the fact that squared fermi nucleon velocities",
    "are @xmath92 we will perform an expansion of the single particle energies for the incoming and outgoing nucleon states @xmath93 in order to perform the integral in eq.([eq1 ] ) we express the energy delta function as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 let us now discuss the range of the integration variables . for the energy transfer range @xmath97 , since @xmath98 , and @xmath99 from the constraint of a real - valued angle . instead , at @xmath100 , the energy transfer can not be negative , so that @xmath101 and @xmath102 and for the incoming nucleon it follows @xmath103 .",
    "finally , if we are interested in the doubly differential cross section this can be obtained as @xmath104 with @xmath105    the sum of scalar(@xmath25 ) and vector(@xmath106 ) contributions from the lagrangian in eq .",

    "we will be interested in a weakly coupled dm particle",
    "so let us set @xmath114 in analogous way to the fermi contact interaction for standard model neutrinos with the vector - axial interaction @xcite . as a further correction at short ranges we can model the structure of the nucleon with a form factor @xmath115 .",
    "we will consider a monopolar form with a cut - off parameter @xmath116 gev .",
    "then we will replace @xmath117 and @xmath118 with @xmath119 so that @xmath120 . + retaining the lowest order in particle velocities in the averaged squared matrix element we obtain @xmath121 this factor provides the relation between the dynamical nuclear structure factor for positive and negative energy transfers @xmath122 as the thermodynamic environment can donate energy to the outgoing particle .",
    "as we are interested in obtaining the total integrated cross section per unit volume @xmath123 and the inverse of it , i.e. the mean free path , @xmath124 , we must integrate over all possible outgoing energy transfer values and solid angle . in this way we obtain",
