    "it is known that a significant number of black holes ( bhs ) of stellar origin should form in the first million years in globular clusters ( gcs ) , with masses @xmath1 .",
    "these bhs segregate toward the gc cores by dynamical friction where they form double binaries [ bh+bh ] and multiple systems . with time , bh@xmath2[bh+bh ] exchange interactions become overwhelmingly important and most of the bhs are ejected by recoil ( sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ) . the last [ bh+bh ] binary(ies )",
    "however will have no other bhs to eject and will remain in the cluster s core ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) . in this cosmic dance some of",
    "the interacting bhs can grow in mass up to @xmath3 by cannibalizing other bhs ( miller & hamilton 2002 ) and these will be preferentially retained in the gc due to their higher inertia ( a high mass bh could also be primordial , born from the heaviest stars ) .",
    "figure 1 shows , for a binary with masses [ @xmath4 , the two lower bounds on the separation @xmath5 , denoted with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as a function of @xmath8 below which recoil by an incoming bh of 10 @xmath9 ( or of @xmath10 ) , and gravitational wave ( gw ) emission would eject the binary and cause coalescence , respectively .",
    "can such a massive dark [ bh+bh ] binary in a gc be detected ?",
    "gcs host a number of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) tracing the population of neutron stars ( nss ) recycled to short periods in accretion events , after capturing the mass - losing star in dynamical encounters .",
    "we here show that psr  j1911 - 5958a , a canonical binary msp , can probe the existence of a [ bh+bh ] binary in ngc6752 .",
    "psr  j1911 - 5958 , recently discovered in ngc6752 ( damico et al . , 2002 ) , is a binary msp found at more than 3.3 half - mass radii from the cluster core .",
    "its companion is a dwarf star of mass @xmath11 moving along a circular orbit with period of 0.86 days . to reach it current position in the cluster halo ,",
    "the pulsar should have been propelled out at a speed @xmath12 km s@xmath13 close to escape , due to recoil in an exchange interaction [ star , star]+ns @xmath14 [ star , ns ] + star . using knowledge of the binary pulsar parameters and constraints imposed by the recycling scenario",
    ", it is found that momentum conservation during the exchange implies an initial orbital separation suspiciously close to the currently observed value , and , most notably , occurrence times for the exchange much longer than the lifetime of ngc6752 ( see colpi , possenti , & gualandris 2002 , for details ) .",
    "thus , only a massive binary can be powerful enough to propel psr  j1911 - 5958 out from the core by transferring a fraction of its binding energy to kinetic energy of the binary pulsar , in a pure scattering event ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "nearly @xmath15 stars would interact with the [ bh+bh ] over a hubble time : scaling to the number of nss and the relative fraction of active msp , we infer an interaction rate for psr  j1911 - 5958 with [ bh+bh ] of @xmath16 gyr@xmath13 implying a detection probability of @xmath17 considering the typical lifetime of the pulsar ."
