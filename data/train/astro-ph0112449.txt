    "reproducing the observed number density of rich galaxy clusters has long been thought to be one of the most reliable constraints on the matter power spectrum on short scales .",
    "it has been studied by many authors over the years ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1999 ; @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , recent determinations typically yielding @xmath1 to @xmath2 for the currently - favoured @xmath3cdm model with matter density @xmath4 .",
    "however , recently evidence has begun to accumulate from a number of sources that this may be a significant overestimate , perhaps by tens of percent .",
    "for example , the required @xmath0 estimated from the 2df galaxy survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or from that survey combined with other probes ( @xcite ) , is significantly lower , and there are now several papers using galaxy clusters that also give lower results ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    a low value was also found recently by @xcite , who used an observed relation between cluster temperature and mass @xcite rather than one derived from hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "this last result is particularly significant , and points to the increasingly evident result that traditional hydrodynamical simulations , which include only adiabatic gas heating during collapse , are unable to reproduce the observed properties of clusters .",
    "for example , the recent _ chandra _ results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter asf01 ) indicate that , at least in the inner regions where data exists , clusters are considerably hotter for a given mass than predicted by adiabatic simulations .    here",
    "we address the question of whether the inclusion of additional gas physics , both radiative cooling of the gas and preheating of the gas before cluster formation , is capable of bringing the simulations into agreement with observations .",
    "we concentrate only on the inner regions of clusters , for which temperature profiles have been measured by _",
    "chandra _ , and we find that indeed the observations can be reproduced . in itself",
    "this is not sufficient aid to theorists seeking to constrain @xmath0 , which requires an accurate description of clusters out to the virial radius , but this encouraging result suggests that simulations may soon be useful for this purpose .",
    "we will explore the cluster temperature  mass relation out to larger radii in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the distribution of hot gas in a cluster can be used to measure its mass .",
    "the intracluster medium is generally assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium in a spherically - symmetric , static potential and the mass is determined by balancing pressure support against the gravitational attraction : @xmath5 giving @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pressure of the intracluster medium , @xmath8 its density , @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath10 the gravitational constant , and @xmath11 g the mean mass per particle .",
    "where  is simply the thermal pressure , then  corresponds to the gas temperature .",
    "one should really include all forms of pressure support for the gas : kinetic ( i.e.  turbulence ) , magnetic , coupled relativistic particles , etc .. we have checked in our simulations that the contribution from kinetic motions within the inner regions of clusters is small and so for clarity of presentation we stick with the thermal pressure in this paper .",
    "note that the determination of the mass within radius @xmath12 depends only upon the properties of the gas at that radius ; in particular the mass determination is not affected by conditions in the outer parts of clusters where the properties are poorly determined .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : hydro ] that the use of equation  ( [ eq : masshydro ] ) leads to good estimates of the mass within regions accessible to _ chandra _ observations .",
    "this lends credence to the mass determinations from x - ray observations that we use in this paper .      if we apply equation  ( [ eq : masshydro ] ) to measure the mass , , within a radius , @xmath13 , for which the enclosed density is @xmath14 times the critical density , then @xmath15 where @xmath16 measured at .    for self - similar clusters ,",
    "for which  is independent of mass and @xmath17 is a constant multiple of the observed temperature , @xmath18 , we recover a scaling relation @xmath19 . in order to compare different results",
    "we will write @xmath20 @xmath21 gives the relative normalization of the relations ; if @xmath22 then this comparison will be exact only for @xmath23 .",
    "theorists can most easily predict the mass within the virial radius of cluster , corresponding to @xmath24 for our chosen cosmology , but x - ray observations do not extend to such large radii and so some degree of extrapolation ( i.e.  the extension of a mass - model beyond the range of the observational data ) is usually required .",
    "a useful summary of simulated and observational results is given in @xcite .",
    "the main simulated catalogues are by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former two , using smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , found @xmath25 , whereas the latter , using an eulerian grid - code found @xmath26 . in a more recent paper , in which they considered a variety of definitions of x - ray temperature for an ensemble of 24 highly - resolved sph clusters , @xcite agreed with this lower normalization .",
    "none of these simulations included radiative cooling .",
    "by contrast the observational results using resolved surface - brightness and temperature profiles from _ rosat _ and _ asca _ have higher normalizations .",
    "@xcite find @xmath27 , whereas @xcite and @xcite both find @xmath28 .    despite the uncertainty in both the simulated and the observational results ,",
    "it is clear that the observed normalization of the temperature  mass relation significantly exceeds the simulated one .      in this paper , we attempt a partial resolution of the differences between simulations and observations discussed in the previous section . in doing this ,",
    "we concentrate on the results of asf01 .",
    "the reasons for this are fourfold :    1 .   _",
    "chandra _ observations give the best available estimates of density and temperature profiles for the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the mass estimates are , mostly , backed up by observations and modelling of gravitationally - lensed background galaxies ( arcs ) .",
    "3 .   they present results for the mass - weighted temperature of the gas .",
    "the use of mass - weighted rather than emission - weighted temperatures greatly simplifies the comparison of simulations and observations .",
    "they do not attempt to extrapolate their results beyond the radius that is accessible to observations .",
    "asf01 measured the mass and temperature of 5 clusters within . they found a best - fit slope for the mass - temperature relation that is consistent with the self - similar value of 1.5 .",
    "we rewrite their relation here with mass as the ordinate as we are complete in mass rather than temperature in our simulations : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass - weighted gas temperature within .",
    "the simulations that we discuss in this paper were carried out using the hydra /hydrodynamics code ( @xcite ; @xcite ) on the cray t3e computer at the edinburgh parallel computing centre as part of the virgo consortium programme of investigations into structure formation in the universe .",
    "they will be described fully in a longer paper ( in preparation ) and so we just summarize the properties here . note that the simulations are very similar to those discussed in an earlier paper , @xcite , but the parameters have been slightly adjusted so as to give a better fit to the observed luminosity  temperature relation of clusters .    in this paper we present results for a single cosmology with density parameter @xmath31 , cosmological constant @xmath32 , baryon density @xmath33 , hubble parameter @xmath34 , cold dark matter density fluctuation parameter @xmath35 , normalization @xmath36 and gravitational softening @xmath37kpc .",
    "160@xmath38 particles each of gas and dark matter were used in a box of side 100@xmath39mpc , giving particle masses of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "three simulations were undertaken , each with identical initial conditions so that the clusters that they produce are directly comparable , but with different cooling properties :    an adiabatic run included for testing and comparison purposes only .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the gas in the centres of the clusters extracted from this run has short cooling times and would not be present in real systems .",
    "this simulation vastly overestimates the x - ray luminosity of the clusters .",
    "this run includes radiative cooling using the cooling tables of @xcite and assumes a time - varying metallicity @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the age of the universe in units of the current time .",
    "cooled material is permitted to form stars , removing low - entropy material with short cooling times from the centres of the clusters . as shown in @xcite , the inflowing gas which replaces it has a higher net entropy and hence a higher temperature .",
    "a drawback of this run is that the cooling is limited only by numerical resolution and is therefore very ad - hoc . in this",
    "run up to half the baryonic mass in clusters has cooled , much more than is observed .",
    "this run also includes radiative cooling .",
    "additionally , at @xmath44 the energy of each gas particle was increased by an amount @xmath45kev to crudely model energy injection at high redshift .",
    "this has the effect of strongly suppressing cooling so that by the end of the simulation under 1 per cent of the gas in clusters has cooled , much less than is observed .",
    "the radiative and preheating runs both reproduce the observed luminosity  temperature relation whilst having very different amounts of cooled gas .",
    "one might hope , therefore , that their thermal properties also bracket those of real clusters .",
    "we justify this statement further in section  [ sec : ent ] below .",
    "figure  [ fig : hydro ] compares measures of enclosed mass versus radius for the third - largest cluster in the preheating simulation ( similar results are obtained for the non - radiative and radiative simulations ) .",
    "this particular cluster was chosen because the two largest clusters both show signs of disturbance within @xmath46 .",
    "the solid line shows enclosed mass as a function of radius .",
    "the dashed line shows the mass estimated from equation  ( [ eq : masshydro ] ) using the thermal pressure ; a similar result is obtained using the total ( thermal plus kinetic ) pressure but we have omitted this from the plot for clarity .    the estimated mass jiggles up and down because of variations in the local pressure gradient .",
    "this scatter could be much reduced by the fitting of a smooth curve to the pressure profile , but for the purposes of this paper we merely wish to make the point that the clusters are in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium within .",
    "this holds true also for the largest two clusters and for all others that we have tested .",
    "note , however , that many of these other clusters show significant departures from equilibrium within @xmath47 .",
    "we conclude that the use of the equation of hydrostatic support to measure masses from x - ray observations of the intracluster medium within  is likely to be accurate to within about 10 per cent with no systematic offset to high or low masses .",
    "figure  [ fig : tgasprof ] shows the projected temperature profiles within  of the third - largest cluster in each of the three simulations .",
    "note how the inflow of higher entropy material has raised the temperature of the gas within  in both the radiative and preheating simulations relative to that in the non - radiative simulation , an effect first noted by @xcite .",
    "the temperature profiles in this figure differ from those shown in figure  1 of asf01 in that they decline slightly beyond 0.25  rather than remaining isothermal .",
    "there are other clusters in our sample , however , for which the temperature profiles are very similar to those seen in the observations .",
    "the differences between the three simulations are best described in terms of their entropy profiles . as figure  [ fig : entprof ] shows ,",
    "the entropy within @xmath48 in the third - largest cluster is raised in the radiative and preheating runs relative to that in the non - radiative run .",
    "this results in a higher gas temperature and a less - peaked density profile .",
    "although the radiative and preheating runs have very different cooled mass fractions , it is not surprising that they have similar entropy profiles as we have adjusted the numerical resolution and feedback parameters so as to reproduce the observed x - ray luminosity  temperature relation and it has been recognized for some time that this requires an excess of entropy in cluster cores ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "once the entropy profile is fixed then , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , the cluster temperature profile is uniquely determined .",
    "as it happens , both the radiative and preheating runs give very similar entropy profiles and hence very similar temperature profiles for this cluster ( and similar results are obtained for other clusters ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that other models that reproduce the luminosity  temperature relation , and in particular ones that give the correct cooled gas fraction , would have similar thermal properties to those discussed here .",
    "the temperature  mass relation for the clusters extracted from the non - radiative simulation is shown in figure  [ fig : tgasmbad ] .",
    "the dashed line is the relation from the simulations of @xcite , extrapolated from their results for an overdensity of 500 as described in asf01 . given this extrapolation",
    "our results are in good agreement with theirs over the range for which our temperatures coincide , @xmath49kev .",
    "by contrast , the relation for observed clusters obtained in asf01 , shown by the solid line , has a significantly lower mass normalization for a given temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : tgasmgood ] shows how this relation is modified once extra gas physics is incorporated .",
    "we see that the increase in temperature associated with radiative cooling and/or preheating is precisely enough to bring the simulated relation into agreement with the observed one .    in the figures",
    "there are several clusters that lie well above the mean relation .",
    "these are mostly clusters for which there is significant velocity substructure ; we indicate with open circles those clusters for which the mean gas and dark matter velocities within  differ by more than 10 per cent of the rms velocity dispersion of the dark matter .",
    "we have shown that simulations are capable of reproducing the observed relationship between mass and temperature in the inner regions of galaxy clusters . in particular",
    ", the mass - weighted temperature versus mass within a radius enclosing an overdensity of 2500 in our radiative and preheating simulations agrees with the observed relation of asf01 .",
    "there are a number of caveats , however . the temperature range of the simulations and the observations barely overlap",
    "; we have one cluster above 6kev , while asf01 have only one below this temperature .",
    "nevertheless , there is no reason to suppose that our results will not extend up to higher temperatures , though confirmation of this will have to await resimulations of clusters drawn from larger simulation boxes .",
    "perhaps more pertinently , none of our simulations presents a fully realistic model of clusters , the radiative model producing too much cooled gas and the preheating model too little .",
    "however they both match the observed x - ray luminosity  temperature relation , because they both have a higher entropy within  than does the non - radiative simulation .",
    "this increase in entropy manifests itself as an increase in the temperature of the gas in the inner parts of the clusters .",
    "one might expect , therefore , that realistic clusters that share the same entropy profile would predict the same temperature  mass relation .",
    "unfortunately , the results presented in this paper and in asf01 are of limited use to theorists who wish to predict the temperature function of clusters in order to constrain cosmology .",
    "this is because they need to relate the mass within the virial radius to the emission - weighted temperature of clusters .",
    "the prediction of masses at @xmath46 or larger radii from the x - ray observations is a harder problem than discussed here and will be investigated in a longer paper .",
    "the simulations used in this paper were carried out on the cray - t3e at the epcc as part of the virgo consortium programme of investigations into the formation of structure in the universe .",
