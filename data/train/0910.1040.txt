    "study of ferromagnetic thin films is an open field of current interest both from a technological and fundamental point of view . on the one hand ferromagnetic thin films are of interest because of their applications in a diverse range of fields , such as magnetic recording technology and spintronics @xcite , while on the other they are of interest because there remain a number of unanswered questions regarding their hysteretic properties , such as the barkhausen effect .",
    "the barkhausen effect is the name given to the noise in the magnetic output generated in a ferromagnetic material when the magnetizing field applied to it is changed @xcite .",
    "the origin of this noise is due to the jerky fashion in which magnetic domain walls move in response to a slowly varying externally applied magnetic field .",
    "the motion is irregular because the domain wall can become pinned , at various points , by impurities in the material . by increasing the strength of the external field",
    "the domain wall can become locally depinned and moves forward , only to become trapped once again by more impurities further ahead @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the barkhausen effect are quantitatively understood in bulk three dimensional materials by the theory of domain wall depinning @xcite .",
    "the experiments can be classified into universality classes depending on the strength of dipolar interaction @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our understanding of barkhausen noise in ferromagnetic thin films is incomplete .",
    "recent experiments show that the morphology of the domain wall depends strongly on temperature @xcite . at temperatures well below the curie temperature , with high saturation magnetization",
    ", the domain wall is observed to have a zigzag structure to minimise the the dipolar interaction energy .",
    "however , upon approaching the curie temperature the morphology of the domain wall is dominated by line tension and is observed to form a rough interface free of large zigzags .",
    "these two regimes correspond to different barkhausen noise universality classes and the exponents exhibit a crossover as a function of temperature .    here",
    "we demonstrate that this crossover can be understood by considering the effect of the long range dipolar forces on the morphology and dynamics of a magnetic domain wall in a thin ferromagnetic material .",
    "we consider a head - on domain wall consisting of two domains of opposite in plane magnetisation , due to large anisotropy along the easy axis .",
    "this situation we model as a three state spin-1 ising hamiltonian @xcite , whereby the interaction between neighbouring spins is ferromagnetic and is in competition with a long range ( antiferromagnetic ) dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "in addition the hamiltonian also includes a random quenched field ( which represents the effect of pinning sites ) and an extra term which models the effect of an external magnetic field . by increasing the magnitude of the external field we can drive the domain wall forward over the pinning sites and collect statistics for the avalanche size distributions .",
    "doing this for a range of values of the saturation magnetisation we confirm that behaviour of the barkhausen noise can be described by two separate universality classes , depending on the value of the saturation magnetization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present the simulation model , followed by an overview of the numerical results in section iii .",
    "section iv finishes the paper with conclusions .",
    "we simulate the dipolar spin 1 random field ising model ( rfim ) in a 2d triangular lattice with in plane magnetization .",
    "a similar model was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with out of plane magnetization .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 + \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & & + d \\sum_{ij}s_i s_j\\frac{1 - 3\\cos^2 \\theta_{ij}}{r_{ij}^3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the first term describes the exchange interactions between nearest neighbour spins with a strength @xmath1 , the second term takes into account the contributions of the applied external field @xmath2 and the parameter @xmath3 controls the relevance of the @xmath4 state , respectively .",
    "the third term includes the dipolar interactions between two spins @xmath5 and @xmath6 at a distance @xmath7 , with a strength @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the saturation magnetization . in the simulations ,",
    "we also add a fictitious demagnetizing energy @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the demagnetizing factor and @xmath12 the total magnetization of the system .",
    "this final term has been introduced only for computational convenience , since dipolar interactions are accounted for by the third term , and allows the domain wall to be kept around the coercive field . in experiments this situation is realised by recording magnetization dynamics slightly below the coercive field @xmath13 and then letting the domain wall move by thermal activation .",
    "this case would be slower to simulate with our model , but avalanche statistics is expected to be same in the limit of small @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we note that disorder is modeled by in the system by a quenched random field @xmath14 extracted from a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath15 .    ) .",

    "we consider weak disorder , setting @xmath29 .    in this limit ,",
    "a spin-1 model is convenient in describing the domain wall dynamics since the intermediate @xmath4 state causes the domain walls to have a finite width so that spurious lattice effects are less pronounced than in systems where an abrupt transition between neighboring domains takes place .",
    "such lattice effects , which are a problem in the spin @xmath30 case , include faceting a case in which the length of a boundary between two points has a different value depending on its orientation with respect to the crystallographic axis @xcite .",
    "lattice anisotropy is also reduced using a triangular lattice , instead of the more conventional square lattice .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath3 is chosen so that problem of faceting , as described above , is minimized - which according to our simulations occurs for @xmath31 .",
    "the simulations are started from a state with all spins @xmath32 except at the bottom layer of the system where a boundary condition @xmath33 is imposed .",
    "this creates an initially flat head - to - head domain wall in the system .",
    "the external field value is then increased from zero until the first spin at the domain wall becomes unstable , i.e. the local field @xmath34 of the spin @xmath5 given by @xmath35 changes sign ( note here we have explicitly included the fictitious demagnetizing term ) .",
    "this spin is then flipped from @xmath32 to @xmath4 , or from @xmath4 to @xmath33 . due to the interactions between different spins",
    "( both through the local exchange interactions and the long range dipolar fields ) , this initial spin flip can cause other spins to flip as well , leading to a cascade of activity or an avalanche .",
    "the external field is kept constant during such an avalanche . the avalanche size @xmath36",
    "is defined as the total number of spins flipped during an avalanche .",
    "all the spin flips are taken to proceed via the intermediate @xmath4 state , and only spins at the domain wall are flipped , preventing domain nucleation in front of the interface .",
    "each time the activity stops , the magnitude of the external field @xmath2 is again increased by an amount which causes one of the spins on the lattice to become unstable , and a new avalanche is initiated .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the domain wall has moved from one end of the system to the other .",

    "in addition , the exponent for the case without dipolar interactions is close to the theoretically expected value of @xmath56 for the @xmath57 dimensional interface depinning of the short range interaction universality class @xcite .",
    "when the strength of the dipolar interactions is increased , we observe a crossover to a different exponent value , close to the value reported for a lattice model for zigzag domain walls @xcite .    by inspecting the domain wall morphology in fig .",
    "[ fig : domain ] we observe that this change in the exponent value is accompanied with a change in the domain wall structure : for low @xmath43 , the domain walls are almost flat , with some roughness due to the interaction with the random field disorder . for larger values of @xmath43 ,",
    "a characteristic zigzag or sawtooth pattern develops , as a result of the interface trying to minimize the magnetostatic energy due to the magnetic charges at the interface .",
    "this feature is again in excellent agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "our simulations demonstrate a striking change in the morphology of a head - on domain wall as the saturation magnetisation is increased .",
    "it is clear that this change in the morphology is responsible for the cross - over between the two universality classes , as evidenced by the change in value of the avalanche size exponent @xmath46 .",
    "this difference helps explain , in part , the variation in the experimentally measured scaling exponents .",
    "however , despite this success we believe that the present model is subject to limitations due to the underlying lattice symmetry of the model .",
    "it is well known that lattice effects can have an unwanted influence on the dynamics / morphology of a system and this can only be overcome by simulating prohibitively large systems . in order to obtain a faithful estimation of the avalanche size exponents it is necessary instead to consider an off - lattice model .",
    "in such a model the object of interest is the domain wall itself , which can be described as a series of vertices connected by straight edges .",
    "the various interactions between spins can be interpreted as forces acting on the domain wall , while the position of the vertices describing the domain wall become the degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "such a model is currently under investigation by the present authors .",
