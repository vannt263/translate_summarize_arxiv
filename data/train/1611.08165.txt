    "the high accuracy investigation of the evolution of dynamical systems is a principal task in various astrophysical and physical problems , e.g. trajectories of artificial satellites testing the general relativity @xcite , orbits and precession of planets of the solar system @xcite , galactic dynamics and gravitating n - body problem @xcite , etc",
    ". therefore , development of more advanced methods , especially of those enabling non - iterative , and hence with negligible error storage at each iteration , for description of evolution of dynamical systems or broadening the classes of systems to which they are applicable , are of particular interest .    among the principal issues",
    "is the numerical treatment of systems in chaotic regimes , including the tools for revealing the chaos .",
    "for example , since , on the one hand , lyapunov exponents are characteristics in the limit of infinite time , on the other hand , long iterative trajectory computations lead to inevitable accumulation of errors , suggested numerical procedures for n - dimensional non - linear systems ( e.g. @xcite ) can be applied and interpreted with limited efficiency .",
    "hence , time error - free schemes developed even for particular models such as @xcite , can be efficient .",
    "methods of theory of dynamical systems are rather efficient for numerical studies of complex systems , including chaotic , random ones @xcite , and that approach is used below .",
    "we develop further the resolvent method suggested in @xcite .",
    "the main issues elaborated below are :    \\1 .",
    "avoiding of the explicit use of laplace and inverse laplace transforms , and obtaining an essentially simplified evolution function representation , we broaden the classes of dynamical systems to which the method is applicable , namely , to non - linear hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "this is crucial , particularly , for n - body codes @xcite .",
    "the evolution function is obtained analytically i.e. with an accuracy independent of time and establishes the asymptotic and time - average characteristics of the system and , hence , enables one to deal also with chaotic trajectories . to this end ,",
    "the error - free estimation of phase point ( state ) evolution in time allows to characterise the behavior and system s accessory at ergodic or mixing phase space regions .",
    "this is , again , a principal topic for gravitating n - body systems known to possess chaotic properties @xcite .",
    "the choice of the initial function , i.e. of the one not affected by perturbations , as a periodic function is justified in various physical contexts , the newly applied procedure does not involve the fourier expansion used previously at resolvent computation . hence , the hamiltonian and the initial function can be represented in more convenient variables depending on the particular dynamical system and aims , e.g. unbounded and non - periodic , differing from action - angle variables .    hamiltonian formalism introduced for dissipative systems needs specific steps , and the transformation to even - dimensional liouville system usually mounts additional constraints , e.g. the dual hamiltonian description @xcite for damping systems requires introduction of auxiliary supplement . based on this , the developed method allows one to follow the trajectory change of the hamiltonian s principal term , not paying attention to the additional part .",
    "then the reduction in @xcite is again applicable via the scheme introduced here .",
    "the method developed below , as we show also with computations on sample systems , enables one the error - free study for broad classes of dynamical systems - of perturbed hamiltonian and dissipative ones - and can be applied to complex physical systems .",
    "hamiltonian equations for a perturbed system given by hamiltonian @xmath0 are considered in @xcite in a unified form @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "systems ( 1 ) are the key ones in kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory stating the survival of the perturbed tori when certain conditions are fulfilled @xcite",
    ".    then for any smooth function @xmath3 the following equation holds @xmath4 where @xmath5    considering @xmath6 as a function of generalized coordinate , conjugate momenta and time , the equation describing the evolution of this function in the phase space changing according to ( 1 ) , gets the form @xmath7    then , according to hamiltonian equations @xmath8 l_0 = \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial p_k}\\ ; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^k}\\ , - \\ ,   \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial q^k}\\;\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial p_k}\\ , = \\ , \\{h_0,\\cdot\\}\\ , , \\\\[5pt ] l_1(v ) = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial p_k}\\ ; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^k}\\ , - \\ ,   \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial q^k}\\;\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial p_k}\\ , = \\ , \\{v,\\cdot\\}\\ , .",

    "then , after selecting the point(state ) in the phase space , e.g. the maximum of @xmath38 , for each @xmath39 we pursue the time evolution of the point(state ) , thus determining the evolution of the hamiltonian system in those time instances .",
    "presented method can be slightly modified ( by adding an extra variable @xmath39 with @xmath40 equation ) for the possible explicit time - dependent hamiltonian systems .    the developed scheme ,",
    "besides providing computation accuracy independent on time , also allows one to investigate the qualitative properties of the hamiltonian system within the ergodic theory approach .",
    "namely , despite the fact that analytical solution for hamiltonian equations may not even exist due to internal resonances between different degrees of freedom , the precise time evolution for any state can be derived using the developed method .",
    "such results can be used to distinguish to which class of dynamical systems the investigated system belongs to , e.g. of ergodic , weak mixing , k - system , etc .",
    "the obtained exact form of @xmath38 is more convenient for the study of asymptotic and average properties of the system . in a hilbert space",
    "the time - average of the evolution ( 20 ) of the system is obtained by von neumann s theorem as @xmath41",
    "the elimination of the explicit laplace transform provides superior feasibility for computer algebra calculation than those described in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "note , that one is free to choose the initial function @xmath42 from the set of the smooth functions upon the convenience for the studied system or the aims .    for the sample system",
    ", we will consider @xmath43 for simplicity .",
    "it is important to note that , in the case of sufficiently large perturbations i.e. @xmath44 , by applying duality principle @xcite , one obtains rescaled hamiltonian and by `` dual '' kam theorem perturbed invariant tori stay preserved .",

    "the phase tori deformed at the increase of @xmath32 in time are not destroyed , but remain only slightly deformed , as stated by kam theory .    during computations , at the increase ( decrease ) of @xmath32 by an order of magnitude , the calculation time varied proportional , at the accuracy @xmath58 .",
    "we described a method of numerical investigation of evolution of dynamical systems independent on time accuracy , i.e. not based on iterations as the typical numerical codes but based on exact computation of the evolution function . in such formulation the method enables the use of computer algebra .",
    "essential point here is that the avoidance of the laplace transform and spatial integration eliminates possible imaginary component appearance during computer algebra calculation , as could happen at the previous procedure .",
    "then the resulting form for the evolution function is far more practical in further study and analysis .",
    "we demonstrated the method on an example of two - dimensional hamiltonian of two oscillators and the error - free time evolution was shown for various values of the perturbation parameter @xmath32 ; the survival of the perturbed tori was shown in accordance to kam theory .",
    "the developed method can be applied to various physical and astrophysical many - dimensional non - linear systems , most notably , to gravitating n - body problem , i.e. to the long term planetary system evolution , galaxy , galaxy cluster dynamics .",
    "another intriguing area of application can be the evolution of cosmological perturbations vs n - body formalism , particularly , for scalar perturbations within the discrete gravitating masses approach of @xcite due to the possibility of adopting the modified method ( dependent on the specific prospect ) to dissipative systems ( e.g. in quasistatic approximation or via scheme discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "then , after estimation of the error - free expressions , the cosmic structure formation and evolution , back reaction effects can be revealed in more details ."
