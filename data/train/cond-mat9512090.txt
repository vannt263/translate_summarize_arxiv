    "nearly sixty years ago , peierls first suggested that correlation effects are the cause of the insulating behavior in nickel oxide.@xcite today , we know that nio is an example of a `` mott insulator ''  an insulator that would be metallic by valence counting . the parent compounds of high temperature superconductors , e.g. , la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , are well described as mott insulators , and have stimulated a renewed interest in the subject .",
    "mott insulators are generally antiferromagnetic , a feature which makes a mean - field spin - density - wave ( sdw ) description possible@xcite .",
    "although an antiferromagnetic insulator within the sdw description resembles a band insulator , the difference between the two types of insulators is most pronounced when charge carriers are added . doping a band insulator ( say with @xmath3-type dopants )",
    "moves the fermi energy from midgap into the valence band .",
    "the hole `` pocket '' in the valence band is responsible for the conductivity . in a mott insulator",
    ", however , doping creates solitons : localized regions of suppressed antiferromagnetic order in which the hole is confined .",
    "the energies of the soliton states lie inside the sdw gap and pin the chemical potential .",
    "the soliton propagation is responsible for the conductivity .",
    "the nature of the solitons in mott insulators depends on the spatial dimensionality . in one dimension ( 1d ) ,",
    "the solitons are topological  they are the anti - phase domain wall.@xcite they have spin quantum number zero and are decoupled from the spin fluctuations at low energies . as a result of the decoupling , the quasiparticle bandwidth is only weakly renormalized.@xcite in @xmath4 , the solitons are non - topological  they are `` bag''-like objects in which the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed consistent with the symmetry of the underlying lattice.@xcite they carry spin and interact strongly with the low - energy spin fluctuations , significantly reducing the quasiparticle bandwidth .    both numerical evidence and the behavior of the optical conductivity in the high temperature superconductors are suggestive of the existence of such quasiparticles in two dimensions . numerical solutions for the single particle green s function indicate a single pole and an incoherent background.@xcite in the high @xmath5 oxides , the optical conductivity @xcite contains two components , a drude peak and a broad mid - infrared absorption , which are related to the added charge carriers ( their spectral weight satisfies the sum rule ) and can not be well fit over the entire region assuming conventional quasiparticles .",
    "furthermore , the two components have very different temperature dependence . while the drude peak is sensitive to temperature ( e.g. the width of the drude peak is @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the mid - infrared part is not .",
    "in fact , the latter survives even in the superconducting state .",
    "this type of optical conductivity is , however , what would be expected from solitonic quasiparticles whose conduction is responsible for the drude peak and whose internal structure generates the mid - infrared absorption .",
    "such behavior is seen in other doped mott insulators,@xcite and systems such as doped polyacetylene@xcite in which solitons are known to exist .    in this paper",
    ", we solve the mean - field equations self - consistently to determine the internal structure of the soliton and then examine the motion of the soliton in the antiferromagnetic background . in the mean - field treatment",
    "described below , the directional fluctuations of the order parameter are turned off .",
    "consequently , the mean - field solution exhibits long - range order which breaks the lattice translational symmetry . at low energy and long wavelength",
    "the important dynamical degrees of freedom are _ a ) _ the motion of the charged solitons , and _",
    "b ) _ the directional fluctuation of the antiferromagnetic order parameter . these quantum fluctuations restore the symmetry broken at the mean - field level . to obtain an effective action governing these important dynamical processes",
    ", we force the antiferromagnetic order parameter to have both solitons ( with time - dependent locations ) and space - time - dependent directional twists .",
    "we then eliminate the electron degrees of freedom corresponding to particle - hole pair excitations .    in one dimension ,",
    "the soliton in the hubbard model is intimately related to the structure soliton in doped polyacetylene.@xcite in polyacetylene , the soliton arises because the ground state of the undoped material breaks a two - fold symmetry of the total electron - phonon hamiltonian . for the undoped ( i.e. half - filled ) hubbard model in 1d , there is no known broken symmetry .",
    "the spin - spin correlation decays algebraically.@xcite from this point of view it is surprising that there exist finite - size solitons upon doping .",
    "the key to the solution of the puzzle is the realization of the very different roles played by the longitudinal ( magnitude ) and transverse ( direction ) components of the antiferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "a useful picture for the algebraic order in the 1d hubbard model is the following : imagine locally ( in the sense of both space and time ) the order parameter has a well - developed magnitude .",
    "however , on a much larger space - time scale , the direction of these local order parameters fluctuates , which destroys the long - range order .",
    "in other words , the algebraic antiferromagnetic correlation is due to the power - law decay of the directional correlation between local order parameters , not due to the absence of local moments . in the case of high @xmath5 oxides ( 2d system )",
    ", this picture is supported by experiments.@xcite thus the mean - field longitudinal spin order plays precisely the same role as the peierls order does in polyacetylene .",
    "the soliton in 1d is a @xmath7-phase - shift domain wall between the two different mean - field ground states . in the absence of doping",
    "the soliton is unstable .",
    "in fact once we allow the spin direction to fluctuate , the soliton decays into an infinite - width spin twist .",
    "finite - size solitons are stabilized by doping . as will be shown later , after accommodating a hole , a charge soliton remains sharp even when the directional fluctuations are allowed .",
    "the resulting action governing the charge and spin dynamics are given by eqs .",
    "( [ nlsm ] ) and ( [ charge_1d ] ) .",
    "here we note that due to the fact that the charged solitons are spinless , the two degrees of freedom are decoupled .    in 2d",
    "a domain wall is an extended object .",
    "thus one may expect that it is more difficult for doping to stabilize it . for _ one hole _",
    "in a half - filled hubbard model with sufficiently big @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the hopping amplitude and @xmath10 is the onsite repulsion strength ) , we find that this expectation is indeed true . in this case",
    "we find that the doped charge is accommodated by a localized _ non - topological _ soliton ( or a spin bag ) .",
    "this soliton is the finite @xmath10 generalization of a hole in the @xmath9@xmath11 model : it has spin quantum number 1/2 and its spin direction is constrained to be opposite to the magnetic moment in its absence . here",
    "due to the finiteness of @xmath10 , a small amount of double occupation exists , and the size of the soliton depends on @xmath8 .",
    "the effective action describing soliton motion and antiferromagnetic fluctuations is the @xmath9@xmath11 model . due to the coupling to the antiferromagnetic fluctuations",
    ", the soliton will be further dressed to form a quasiparticle .",
    "the quasiparticle formation can be simply understood in the string picture by considering the soliton propagation in the antiferromagnetic background.@xcite as the soliton moves , it leaves behind a string of overturned spins which cost antiferromagnetic energy .",
    "this energy cost inhibits the motion of the soliton and mimics the effects of a linearly confining potential .",
    "the bound state of the soliton in this potential is the quasiparticle.@xcite it is important to point out that spin flipping processes in principle can erase the string of frustrated bonds behind the soliton and enable it to escape the potential .",
    "if that happens the quasiparticle is no longer well defined .",
    "exact numerical studies of one hole in an antiferromagnet , however , suggest that this does not happen and the quasiparticle picture remains valid . for the 2d hubbard model with @xmath9 and @xmath10 chosen in the range relevant to the high-@xmath5 superconductors ,",
    "the quasiparticle size is about @xmath12 lattice spacings .",
    "we therefore expect that the qualitative properties of the quasiparticle , such as its quantum numbers , are not changed by the omitted spin flipping processes . however , all quantitative aspects are subject to renormalization .",
    "in addition to their effect on the internal structure of the quasiparticle , quantum spin fluctuations have another important effect ",
    "they generate coherent propagation of the quasiparticle as a whole .",
    "the result is that the quasiparticle primarily hops between neighboring sites within the same sublattice . in the presence of slow time - dependent twisting of the antiferromagnetic order",
    ", the quasiparticle spin must follow the direction of the instantaneous local moment .",
    "thus we arrive at the following `` surfing model '' : imagine a slowly fluctuating membrane whose normal directions define the local directions of the magnetic moments , then the quasiparticles surf on the membrane but have to keep their spins locally perpendicular to the membrane .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "it is known@xcite that when a quantum mechanical particle moves on a fluctuating curved surface under the constraint that its spin must be normal to the local surface element , it experiences a berry phase factor originating from the overlap of its spin states at different space - time points .",
    "if the curvature of the surface is nonzero , such a berry phase can not be eliminated by a gauge transformation .",
    "the effect is analogous to that of a fluctuating magnetic field .",
    "this is precisely the origin of the fluctuating gauge field in the effective theory , eqs .",

    "the usual way to proceed from here is to factorize the hubbard interaction via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",
    "there are many ways to factorize the hubbard interaction , and in principle they are all equivalent .",
    "however , if one does not perform the functional integral over the hubbard - stratonovich field exactly , in particular if one only integrates over the long - wavelength and low - frequency components of the auxiliary field , then different decoupling scheme gives different results .",
    "the latter is a well known phenomenon .",

    "the spirit is the adiabatic approximation : the hopping of the solitons is a local and high - energy process while the low - energy spin excitations are described by slow variation of the spin directions . without holes ,",
    "the short wavelength spin fluctuations cost a lot of energy and can be eliminated .",
    "the result is the renormalization of the coefficients in the non - linear sigma model . in the doped case ,",
    "the energy cost of short wavelength spin fluctuations near the solitons is compensated by the energy gain resulting from the hopping of the solitons .",
    "therefore , short wavelength spin fluctuations can not simply be eliminated as in the undoped case .",
    "let @xmath342 be a typical spin configuration in a short range antiferromagnetically correlated state in an arbitrary region of space , this configuration can be obtained from the perfectly ordered state by applying smoothly varying su(2 ) rotations : @xmath343 we apply the soliton creation operator to this configuration to generate a soliton at an arbitrary site @xmath344 where we used the notation @xmath345 to indicate that the number of highly frustrated spins is zero , i.e.there is no spin which is almost parallel to its neighboring spins . applying on @xmath346 the effective hamiltonian for the solitons , i.e.the @xmath9@xmath11 hamiltonian",
    "( [ htj_2d ] ) , a new state @xmath347 is generated , @xmath348 where @xmath347 is generated by the hopping term of the @xmath9@xmath11 model .",
    "it is a superposition of four configurations in which the soliton has made one hop from the original site @xmath328 to anyone of the four neighbors .",
    "the notation @xmath349 indicates that there is one spin , at the site @xmath328 , which is frustrated with its neighbors .",
    "this is the generalization of the string state of one unit length discussed in ref .   to the smoothly varying antiferromagnetic background .",
    "the other generalized string states , @xmath350 for @xmath351 , are constructed by repeatedly applying the @xmath9@xmath11 hamiltonian to @xmath352 .",

    "( [ string0 ] ) , ( [ string1 ] ) and ( [ stringl ] ) are the effective representation of the @xmath9@xmath11 model in the determination of the quasiparticle structure .",
    "diagonalizing these equations with appropriate latexmath:[$ \\langle i_{0 } , l | h_{t - j }      the formation of the quasiparticle further renormalizes the coefficients in the non - linear sigma model .",
    "although it is not easy to calculate the renormalization accurately , it is rather easy to see that hole ( or soliton ) hopping inside the quasiparticle reduces the spin stiffness .",
    "the spin stiffness is roughly proportional to the longitudinal spin magnitude .",
    "the soliton hopping inside the quasiparticle reduces the average spin magnitude @xmath356 by an amount of @xmath357 times the density of holes , where @xmath358 is the average string length inside the quasiparticle , eq .",

    "( [ qp_state ] ) , we write @xmath369 the state @xmath370 is a superposition of spin configurations ; each of them contains a string of length @xmath371 .",
    "so the matrix element @xmath372 is a sum of matrix elements of @xmath373 between two string configurations .",
    "we need to show that the matrix element of @xmath373 between any two string configurations contain the phase factor @xmath374 . in the bethe lattice",
    "approximation(without winding path ) , the spin exchange operator in @xmath375 generates quasiparticle hopping by chopping off the strings in @xmath376 by two units.@xcite in all these processes , we can explicitly verify that @xmath377 .",
    "a general example is shown in fig .",

    "[ trugman ] .",
    "although not exact , the phase factor is approximately proportional to @xmath380 , for smoothly varying spin directions .",
    "furthermore , the trugman process occurs only for @xmath381 and therefore it is multiplied by a small coefficient @xmath382 .",
    "thus , we have shown that the quasiparticle hopping amplitude acquires the berry phase factor if the spin directions vary smoothly in space and time .",
