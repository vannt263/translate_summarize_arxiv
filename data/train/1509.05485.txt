    ". a characterization of affine surface area was given in ludwig & reitzner @xcite .",
    "connections between affine surface area and the affine plateau problem were discussed , e.g. , trudinger & wang @xcite .",
    "it is also not surprising to see the appearance of affine surface area in polytopal approximation , e.g. , brny @xcite , brczky @xcite , and gruber @xcite .",
    "perhaps , most importantly , it is the crucial ingredient in fundamental affine isoperimetric inequalities and gives rise to some affine analytic inequalities , e.g. , artstein - avidan , klartag , schtt & werner @xcite , caglar & werner @xcite , and lutwak @xcite .",

    ", a new representation of the existing notion of @xmath0 affine surface area using only curvature measures will be derived .",
    "new proofs of the important properties of @xmath0 affine surface area , such as the upper semi - continuity and the @xmath0 affine isoperimetric inequality , will be given using the new representation .",
    "the proofs given will be ones requiring no prior knowledge of the properties already established using other definitions of @xmath0 affine surface area .",
    "it is also the aim of this paper to investigate the relationship between the new representation of @xmath0 affine surface area and the three existing ones .",
    "this will be done by providing direct proofs of equivalence between the new representation and those previously given .",
    "it will become apparent that the new form of @xmath0 affine surface area is , in a sense , `` polar '' to that of lutwak s and `` dual '' to schtt & werner s . in order to establish the equivalence ,",
    "the lipschitz property of a sequence of restrictions of the inverse gauss map will be investigated , which may be of independent interest .",
    "this will be discussed in section [ sec_lip ] .",
    "it is important to note that it is the attempt of the current paper to give a new representation of the usual @xmath0 affine surface area ( not to define a new ( different ) @xmath0 affine surface area ) .",
    "the notion of affine surface area traces back to affine differential geometry . in affine differential geometry , the affine surface area of a convex body @xmath3 with sufficiently smooth boundary ( at least @xmath5 ) and",
    "everywhere positive gauss curvature is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gauss curvature of @xmath3 at @xmath8 ( the boundary of @xmath3 ) and @xmath9 is @xmath10 dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "when @xmath3 has @xmath5 boundary with positive gauss curvature , the gauss map @xmath11 is nice enough to allow the change of variable @xmath12 and we get : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the curvature function of @xmath3 .",
    "a very important result in affine differential geometry is the affine isoperimetric inequality which characterizes ellipsoids . for a convex body @xmath2 with @xmath5 boundary and positive gauss curvature , @xmath15 with equality if and only if @xmath3 is an ellipsoid . here",
    "@xmath16 is the volume of @xmath3 and @xmath17 is the volume of the @xmath4-dimensional unit ball .    extending the definition of affine surface area to one that works for general convex bodies ( without smoothness assumptions ) and still respects the basic properties of the classical definition was of huge interest during the late 80s and 90s ( in the previous century ) . in particular , is there a way to do the extension so that the affine isoperimetric inequality , with the same equality conditions , still holds ?",
    "the first attempt was made by petty @xcite .",
    "he observed that makes sense for convex bodies that possess curvature functions .",
    "the affine isoperimetric inequality was also shown to hold under this extension .",
    "although the gauss curvature and the curvature function do not necessarily exist for general convex bodies , the generalized gauss curvature and the generalized curvature function ( see @xcite or section [ section_preli ] ) exist almost everywhere on @xmath18 and @xmath19 with respect to @xmath10 dimensional hausdorff measure . thus and already suggest two possible extensions .",
    "but , the two extensions are not trivial at all , since the two integrals might not make sense .    with the notion of floating body ,",
    "leichtwei was able to give a geometric meaning to when @xmath20 is the generalized curvature function .",
    "let @xmath2 be a convex body .",
    "the affine surface area of @xmath3 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath20 is the generalized curvature function .",
    "one is tempted to use a strategy similar to how we arrived at to get to work for general convex bodies .",
    "this turns out to be invalid since neither the gauss map nor the inverse gauss map , in this case , is smooth enough ( in fact , not even lipschitz ) to permit such a change of variable . in spite of this unfortunate fact",
    ", there is a natural extension to .",
    "schtt & werner @xcite , via the notion of convex floating body , were able to give a geometric meaning to the integral representation with @xmath22 being the generalized gauss curvature .",
    "let @xmath2 be a convex body .",
    "the affine surface area of @xmath3 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath22 is the generalized gauss curvature .",
    "one of the major characteristics that distinguishes affine surface area ( look at either or ) and other geometric invariants is that affine surface area is not continuous with respect to the hausdorff metric .",
    "for example , any convex body can be approximated by polytopes , but polytopes are always of zero affine surface area .",
    "given this fact , only upper semi - continuity can be expected .",
    "but , even establishing the upper semi - continuity of classical affine surface area ( in the smooth case ) was unsolved in the 80s .",
    "one of the difficulties of establishing this lies in the lack of knowledge of the limit behaviors of the gauss curvature and the curvature function . since and take similar formulations , difficulty persists . note that the lack of continuity also adds to the difficulty of establishing the affine isoperimetric inequality , since we can not establish the inequality for a dense class of convex bodies and then take a limit .",
    "the long conjectured upper semi - continuity of classical affine surface area was settled by lutwak . in @xcite , he found the following characterization of affine surface area for general convex bodies .",
    "let @xmath2 be a convex body .",
    "the affine surface area of @xmath3 is given by @xmath24 where the infimum is taken over all positive continuous functions @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the surface area measure of @xmath3 .",
    "note that lutwak s definition applies to all convex bodies ( even the ones without smoothness assumptions ) .",
    "more importantly , the upper semi - continuity of follows directly from the weak continuity of the measures in the integrals and the fact that the infimum of a class of continuous functionals is upper semi - continuous . since agrees with classical affine surface area for smooth convex bodies with everywhere positive curvature function ( also shown in @xcite ) , this , in turn , proves the upper semi - continuity of classical affine surface area .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the affine isoperimetric inequality can also be established in this case by using the blaschke  santal inequality .    a natural question to ask is : are definitions , , and",
    "as was explained earlier , the equivalence of and is by no means a trivial problem for general convex bodies .",
    "it was not until 1993 that schtt , in @xcite , proved the equivalence  using a somewhat indirect method .",
    "a direct proof was given in @xcite by hug .",
    "that and are equivalent was shown by leitchwei in @xcite .",
    "note that in lutwak s original definition , the infimum is only taken over all positive functions @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "the removal of this restriction was proposed by leichtwei in @xcite and the equivalence between this formulation and lutwak s original definition was shown by dolzmann & hug in @xcite using a topological argument .",
    "note that it is trivial to see that affine surface area is translation invariant .",
    "schtt , in @xcite , proved that affine surface area is a valuation .",
    "hence , affine surface area is an upper semi - continuous valuation that is invariant under volume preserving affine transformations . in a landmark work ,",
    "ludwig & reitzner @xcite established the `` converse '' : if a real - valued upper semi - continuous valuation on the set of convex bodies is invariant under volume preserving affine transformations , then it must be of the form @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the euler characteristic , @xmath33 is volume , and @xmath34 is affine surface area .    observe that and are `` polar '' to each other in the sense that one is defined as an integral over the boundary of the convex body ( domain of the gauss map ) , while the other is defined as an integral over the unit sphere ( image of the gauss map ) .",
    "in fact , as the proof provided by hug in @xcite indicates , definitions and are linked by the gauss map .",
    "also note that is `` dual '' to as one can see in the proof in @xcite .",
    "recall that for a convex body @xmath2 , curvature measures are a list of @xmath4 borel measures defined on @xmath18 that can be defined via local parallel sets . for details ,",
    "the reader should consult chapter 4 in @xcite . among these curvature measures ,",
    "the @xmath35-th and @xmath10-th curvature measures have stronger geometric meanings .",
    "more specifically , for a borel set @xmath36 , the @xmath35-th curvature measure @xmath37 and the @xmath10-th curvature measure @xmath38 of @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the set of outer unit normals of @xmath3 at points in @xmath39 .",
    "note that previous formulations of affine surface area involve @xmath10 dimensional hausdorff measure on @xmath18 ( definition ) , @xmath10 dimensional hausdorff measure on @xmath19 ( definitions and ) , and the surface area measure of @xmath3 ( definition ) .",
    "since curvature measures are also a crucial type of measures associated to a convex body @xmath3 , it is natural to study the relationship between affine surface area and the curvature measures .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate this missing element . to be precise",
    ", the following theorem will be proved :    [ thm_new_1 ] for a convex body @xmath2 , @xmath42 where the infimum is taken over all positive continuous functions @xmath43 .    in light of theorem [ thm_new_1 ] , we may view the right side of as a new representation of the existing notion of affine surface area .",
    "let @xmath2 be a convex body .",
    "the affine surface area of @xmath3 can be defined by @xmath44 where the infimum is taken over all positive continuous functions @xmath43 .",
    "note again that this form of affine surface area uses only curvature measures .",
    "a list of properties of will be given in section [ sec_properties ] .",
    "in particular , among other things , the upper semi - continuity ( theorem [ prop_new_1 ] ) and the affine isoperimetric inequality with equality condition ( theorem [ prop_new_2 ] ) will be demonstrated using the new representation .",
    "the author would like to point out that although previously established , none of the results proved in section [ sec_properties ] require acknowledgement of properties proved under the existing forms .    with the recent development of the @xmath0 brunn - minkowski theory , efforts were also made to generalize affine surface area to its @xmath0 analogue .",
    "one of the key findings in the @xmath0 brunn - minkowski theory is the @xmath0 curvature function discovered by lutwak @xcite . given a convex body",
    "@xmath3 that possesses a curvature function @xmath20 , the @xmath0 curvature function may be defined by @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the support function of @xmath3 .",
    "since the generalized curvature function exists almost everywhere for an arbitrary convex body , the generalized @xmath0 curvature function also exists almost everywhere .",
    "given this notion , @xmath0 affine surface area can be defined .",
    "the notion of @xmath0 affine surface area was introduced by lutwak in @xcite .",
    "he defined the @xmath0 affine surface area of a convex body @xmath2 that contains the origin in its interior to be , @xmath47 where the infimum is taken over all positive continuous functions @xmath25 .",
    "although lutwak originally presented this definition for the case @xmath48 , it works perfectly fine for any @xmath49 as observed by hug in @xcite .    as with the classical @xmath1 case ,",
    "different forms of @xmath0 affine surface area exist . for each @xmath50 , the following form of @xmath0 affine surface area",
    "was given by lutwak @xcite for convex bodies that possess a continuous curvature function and by hug @xcite for general convex bodies , @xmath51 analogously , for each @xmath50 , another form of @xmath0 affine surface area , was given by hug in @xcite , @xmath52    note that is the @xmath0 extension of while is the @xmath0 extension of .",
    "the equivalence of and was proved by hug in @xcite .",
    "that and are equivalent for convex bodies that possess a positive continuous curvature function was due to lutwak @xcite , and can in general be proved in a similar way as leitchwei did in @xcite for @xmath1 as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to prove the analogue of theorem [ thm_new_1 ] in the @xmath0 setting .",
