    "there are several reasons to increase the still rather meagre data on very high-@xmath1 , powerful radio galaxies ( e.g. mccarthy @xcite , pariskij et al .",
    "high-@xmath1 radio galaxies are unique laboratories for investigating the early stages of galaxy and agn evolution at look - back times corresponding to more than 90% of the age of the universe derived from friedmann models .",
    "they may be used as tracers of the first generation of galaxy clusters ( peacock & nicholson @xcite ; peacock @xcite ) and of the physical state of the intergalactic space ( parijskij at al .",
    "@xcite ) . by high - resolution",
    "one may study important morphological features related to e.g. merging activity and `` star burst '' regions .    at redshift @xmath4 ,",
    "120 radio galaxies are known at present ( de brueck et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in comparison with about 250 radio loud quasars ( @xmath50.03 jy in veron - cetty & veron @xcite ) , though the former are intrinsically more abundant .",
    "according to the popular unified scheme , both classes are the same thing .",
    "one can study the host galaxies and close environments of radio galaxies , but this is difficult for qsos at a similar redshift .",
    "one aspect , where even a single galaxy may be decisive , is the question of how close in time to the cosmological singularity it is possible to find galaxies , with normal stellar population and supermassive compact objects in their nuclei . though the use of high-@xmath1 objects in classical cosmological tests is hampered by severe problems , development of such tests is still one aim of observational cosmology . to identify selection effects and evolution ,",
    "large samples are required .",
    "one must increase identifications of very remote galaxies , also in view of the new generation ground and space telescopes , which will allow their study at high resolution .",
    "it has been known since the late 70 s ( tielens et al . , @xcite ; blumenthal & miley @xcite ) that radio sources with steep spectra are optically fainter ( and hence probably more distant ) than sources with flatter spectra .",
    "later it was established that observing faint radio sources with ultra - steep spectra ( uss ) is an efficient way to detect radio galaxies at high redshifts ( see e.g. mccarthy @xcite ) . as the uss fanaroff - riley type ii ( frii - type ; fanaroff & riley @xcite ) radio galaxies are not good `` standard radio candles '' and as the reason for the success of the spectrum criterium is not known ( see e.g. rttgering et al .",
    "@xcite ) , it is not clear what the outcome will be when uss samples are extended to a progressively fainter flux limit . fainter flux may imply 1 ) larger redshifts , 2 ) similar redshifts , though weaker radio luminosity , or 3 ) smaller redshifts and still weaker luminosities .",
    "the first alternative is most interesting , though cases 2 and 3 are also important : extension of the luminosity range will help one to uncover the influence of radio luminosity on the classical cosmological tests ( angular size ",
    "redshift ; nilsson et al .",
    "@xcite and hubble diagram ; eales et al .",
    "@xcite ) and to decide whether alignment effect depends primarily on redshift or luminosity .    the flux range where differential normalized source counts show steepening is generally regarded as the most promising hunting place for high redshift objects .",
    "parijskij et al .",
    "( @xcite ) pointed out that the bulk of the ratan-600 sample ( see below ) has fluxes in the range of 10 - 50 mjy at 3.9 ghz where the normalized counts show a maximum steepening , usually interpreted as a cosmological effect .",
    "a similar steepening in the counts is seen separately for steep spectrum sources ( fig . 6 in kellermann & wall 1987 ) .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. rttgering et al .",
    "@xcite ) that the most effective way to find distant galaxies would be a uss sample with @xmath6 jy .",
    "indeed , this has proven to be so since about 50% of the rttgering et al .",
    "( @xcite ) uss objects have @xmath4 ( van ojik et al .",
    "the bright end of the uss sources is well studied ( e.g. @xmath7 mccarthy @xcite and references therein ) and recently fainter flux limits have been reached ( e.g. @xmath8 @xmath9 jy thompson et al . @xcite ; eso / key - project @xmath10 jy rttgering at el .",
    "@xcite ) . however , in the rttgering et al .",
    "( @xcite ) sample 365 mhz flux density distribution peaks at about 1 jy .",
    "this paper is part of a programme initiated at the special astrophysical observatory ( russia ) with the aim of searching distant radio galaxies and investigating the early evolutionary stages of the universe ( goss et al .",
    "we wish to extend the steep - spectrum criteria to fainter fluxes than previously .",
    "this is accomplished by rc and utrao catalogues ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] )    our high frequency catalogue is based on a sample of faint radio sources originally discovered using the ratan-600 radio telescope in the `` kholod '' ( `` cold '' ) experiment in 1980 - 81 ( parijskij et al .",
    "@xcite ; parijskij et al .",
    "@xcite parijskij & korolkov @xcite ) . in the experiment , performed at 7.6 cm ( 3.9 ghz ) , the strip around the sky at @xmath11=5@xmath12 20@xmath13 was surveyed with a limiting flux of about 4 mjy .",
    "the rc catalogue resulted in containing 1145 objects . within the inner strip of @xmath14 5@xmath13 the completeness of the catalogue reaches 80% at the flux limit s@xmath15 mjy and is almost 100% at 15mjy ( parijskij et al .",
    "@xcite ) . such flux limits are really quite faint and allow one to identify a large number of steep spectrum sources , if a low frequency catalogue with sufficiently faint flux limit is available .",
    "the utrao ( douglas et al .",
    "@xcite ) is such a catalogue with a flux limit of @xmath16 100mjy at 365 mhz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the ratan-600 catalogue ( rc ) provided the first sample which allowed one to calculate the spectral index for practically all utrao sources within the region covered by the `` kholod '' experiment ( soboleva et al .",

    "<S> we present direct imaging data of 22 ultra steep spectrum radio sources obtained at ( or near ) a subarcsecond seeing . </S>",
    "<S> the basic sample of 40 double radio sources was selected from the ratan-600 catalogue . </S>",
    "<S> the frii - structure has been confirmed with vla and preliminary optical identifications which come from the 6 m - telescope . </S>",
    "<S> as the ratan-600 flux limit at 3.9 ghz ( @xmath0 10mjy ) is fainter than that of major surveys , the sample may have high-@xmath1 contents . </S>",
    "<S> this is also suggested by the faint magnitudes in the hubble diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the final aim is to create a homogeneous sample of high-@xmath1 radio galaxies in a well defined strip around the sky , with faint radio limit and subarcsecond morphology down to @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we could confirm 16 identifications down to @xmath324 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the extended objects have multicomponent structures as expected from other surveys of high - redshift radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we found five unresolved objects even with a subarcsecond seeing . </S>",
    "<S> of the remaining six objects , three are extremely faint and the other three have such a complex environment that further observations are needed to confirm the optical identification . </S>"
