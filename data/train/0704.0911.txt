    "the colors of the plumes match the colors of the outer parts of the central galaxies , indicating the plumes are tidally shorn stars with little gas .",
    "there is structure in most of the plumes consisting of arcs or sharp edges .",
    "this is presumably tidal debris from early type galaxies with little or no gas ( e.g. larson & tinsley 1978 ; malin & carter 1980 ; schombert et al .",
    "this type of interaction is relatively rare in the gems and goods images , perhaps because the tidal debris is faint .",

    "the image in the top left panel of figure [ fig1diffuse ] ( galaxy 1 ) has a giant diffuse clump in the upper right corner .",

    "figure [ fig2bants ] shows interactions that resemble the local antennae pair , so we refer to them as antennae types .",
    "these types have long tidal tails and double nuclei or highly distorted centers that appear to be mergers of disk galaxies .",

    "2005a ; de mello et al .",
    "2006 ; straughn et al .",
    "2006 ) , which have one main clump and a sometimes wiggly tail that may contain smaller clumps .",
    "some antennae have giant clumps near the ends of the tails which could have formed there ( galaxies 16 and 17 ) and are analogous to the clump at the end of the superantennae ( mirabel et al .",
    "galaxy 18 is in a crowded field with at least two long tidal arms ; here we consider only the tail system in the north , which is in the upper part of the figure .",
    "these long - tail systems are relatively rare and all the best cases are shown in the figure ; their average redshift , 0.70 , is typical for gems and goods fields .",
    "galaxy 24 is somewhat like a tadpole galaxy , but its very narrow tail and protrusion on the anti - tail side of the main clump are unlike structures seen in tadpoles of the ultra deep field .    for the antennae galaxies in figure [ fig2bants ] , the tails have an average ( v - z ) color that is negligibly bluer , 0.10@xmath280.25 mag , than the central disks . in a study of tidal features in local arp atlas galaxies , schombert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) also found that the tail colors are uniform and similar to those of the outer disks .",
    "they noted that the most sharply - defined tails are with spiral systems and the diffuses plumes are with ellipticals .",
    "this correlation may be true here also , but it is difficult to tell from figure [ fig1diffuse ] whether the smooth distorted systems are intrinsically disk - like .    galaxy 20 in figure [ fig2bants ] is an interesting case .",
    "it has an elliptical clump at the end of its tail that could be one of the collision partners .",
    "there are two central galaxy cores , however , and their interaction may have formed the tidal arms without this companion . furthermore , the clump at the tip is aligned perpendicular to the tail , which is unusual for a tidal dwarf .",
    "thus it is possible that the clump was a pre - existing galaxy lying in the orbital plane of one of the larger galaxies now at the center .",
    "presumably this former host is the galaxy currently connected to the dwarf by the tidal arm .",
    "the interaction could have swung it around to its current position at the tip .",
    "a similar case occurs for the local ic 2163/ngc 2207 pair , which has a spheroidal dwarf galaxy at the tip of its tidal arm ( elmegreen et al .",
    "such swing - around dwarfs should have the same dynamical origin as the large pools of gas and star formation that are at the tips of superantenna - type galaxies ; i.e. the whole outer disk moves to this position during the interaction ( elmegreen et al . 1993 ; duc et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "figure [ fig3m51types ] shows examples of interactions that we refer to as m51-type galaxies , where the tidal arms can be bridges that connect the main disk galaxy to the companion ( galaxy 33 ) , or tails on the opposite side of the companion ( e.g. , galaxies 34 and 35 ) , or both ( galaxy 36 ) . in galaxy 44 , the tidal arm looks like the debris path of a pre - existing galaxy that lies at the right ; the orbit path apparently curves around on the left .",
    "the m51-types usually have strong spirals in the main disk . in the top row ,",
    "the tails and bridges are thin and diffuse .",
    "the galaxy on the left in the lower row ( galaxy 42 ) has a thick , fan - shaped tail opposite the companion .",
    "some bridges have star formation clumps ( galaxy 40 ) and others appear smooth ( galaxy 33 ) .",
    "interactions like this , especially those with small companions , are more common than the previous two types and only a few best cases are shown in figure [ fig3m51types ] and discussed in the rest of this paper .",
    "figure [ fig4shrimps ] shows examples of galaxies dominated by one highly curved , dominant arm and large , regularly - spaced clumps of star formation .",
    "we call these `` shrimp '' galaxies because of their resemblance to the tail of a shrimp .",
    "although their star formation indicates they contain gas and therefore are disk systems , there are no well - defined spirals ( except for the prominent arm ) , merging cores , or obvious central nuclei .",
    "the clumps resemble the beads - on - a - string star formation in spiral density waves and probably have the same origin , a gravitational instability ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1983 ; kim & ostriker 2006 ; bournaud , duc , & masset 2003 ) .",
    "the j - shaped morphology is reminiscent of the 90 kpc gas tail of m51 ( rots et al .",
    "1990 ) and the 48 kpc gas tail observed in ngc 2535 ( kaufman et al .",
    "rots el al .",
    "point out that the m51 gas tail is much broader ( 10 kpc ) than the narrow tails seen in merging systems like the antennae . the broad tail in galaxy 42 ( fig .",
    "3 ) is similar to the m51 tail .",
    "sometimes there is a bright tail with no obvious companion ( galaxies 56 , 57 , and 60 ) ; one of these , galaxy 56 , was in our ring galaxy study ( elmegreen & elmegreen 2006 ) .",
    "asymmetric , strong arm galaxies like this are not common in gems and goods ; this figure shows the best cases .",
    "figure [ fig : wrecks ] has a selection of irregular galaxies that appear to be interactions .",
    "most of them suggest an assembly of small pieces , so we refer to them as assembly types .",
    "if they were slightly more round in overall shape , with more obvious interclump emission , then we would classify them as clump - clusters , as we did in the udf ( elmegreen et al .",
    "the galaxy in the lower left ( galaxy 83 ) is like this .",
    "the resemblance of these types to clump - clusters suggests that some of the clumps are accreted from outside the disk and others form from gravitational instabilities in a pre - existing gas disk , as suggested previously ( elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) .",
    "the system in the lower right ( galaxy 85 ) could be interacting spirals , or a triple system , or a bent chain ( as studied in elmegreen & elmegreen 2006 ) .",
    "there are many examples of highly irregular galaxies like these in the gems and goods fields ; indeed most galaxies at @xmath29 are peculiar in this sense ( conselice 2005 ) . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss only these 12 galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : equals ] has samples of grazing or close interactions , with spirals at the top of the page ( numbers 86 - 93 ) , ellipticals lower down ( numbers 95 - 97 ) and two polar - ring galaxies ( numbers 99 and 100 ) in the lowest row at the middle and right bottom .",
    "we refer to these paired systems as `` equals '' because their distinguishing feature is that the two galaxies have comparable size .",
    "the pair number 89 has a bright oval in the smaller galaxy , which is characteristic of recent tidal forces for an in - plane , prograde encounter such as ic2163/ngc2207 ( sundin 1993 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "there is a spiral - elliptical pair on the right in the middle row ( galaxy 94 ) .",
    "double ellipticals in the udf were studied previously ( elmegreen et al .",
    "2005a , coe et al . 2006 ) .",
    "near neighbors like this have been studied previously in the gems field ; 6 double systems out of 379 red sequence galaxies were identified as being dry merger candidates , as reproduced in simulations ( bell et al .",
    "the models of mergers of early - type systems by naab et al .",
    "( 2006 ) apparently account for kinematic and isophotal properties of ellipticals better than the formation of ellipticals through late - type mergers alone . for the pairs in our figure ,",
    "both components have the same combo17 redshift .",
    "there are many other examples of close galaxy groups and near interactions in the gems and goods surveys . in what follows",
    "we discuss only the properties of those shown in figure [ fig : equals ] .",
    "the interacting types shown in the figures are meant to be as distinct as possible .",
    "these and other good cases are listed in table 1 by running number , along with their combo-17 catalog number , redshift , and r magnitude . there is occasionally some ambiguity and overlap in the interaction types , particularly between m51-types and shrimps when the m51-types have small or uncertain companions at the ends of their prominent tails .",
    "projection effects can lead to uncertainties in the classifications as well , particularly for antennae whose tails may be foreshortened .",
    "nevertheless , these divisions serve as a useful attempt to sort out the most prominent features among interacting galaxies .",
    "there are numerous other galaxies in gems and goods that are apparently interacting , but most of them are too highly distorted to indicate the particular physical properties of interest here , namely , disk - to - halo mass ratio and star formation scale .",
    "the integrated johnson restframe ( u - b ) and ( b - v ) colors from combo-17 for the observed galaxies with measured redshifts are shown in a color - color diagram in figure [ fig : shrimf6 ] .",
    "the crosses in the diagram are johnson colors for standard hubble types ( fukugita et al .",
    "our sample of galaxies spans the range of colors from early to late hubble types , although the bluest are bluer than standard irregular galaxies ( a typical i m has u - b@xmath30 , b - v@xmath31 ) .",
    "the reddest galaxies tend to be the diffuse types , thought to originate with ellipticals involved in interactions .",
    "the two reddest galaxies in our sample are the diffuse types number 1 and 2 in figure [ fig1diffuse ] .",
    "the bluest tend to be the assemblies , consistent with their having formed recently .",
    "figure [ fig : shrimf15 ] shows a restframe color - magnitude diagram . early and late type galaxies usually separate into a `` red sequence '' and a `` blue cloud '' on such a diagram ( baldry et al . 2004 ; faber et al .",
    "the solid line indicates the boundary between these two regions from a study of 22,000 nearby galaxies ( conselice 2006b ) .",
    "the short - dashed lines are the limits of the conselice ( 2006 ) survey ; local galaxies are brighter than the vertical short - dashed line and their colors lie between the horizontal short - dashed lines .",
    "the long - dashed lines approximately outline the bright limit for the local blue cloud galaxies .",
    "our galaxies fall in both the red sequence and the blue cloud .",
    "the restframe colors in figure [ fig : shrimf15 ] are consistent with their morphological appearances .",
    "the red sequence galaxies in the figure usually appear smooth ( the diffuse types ) or lack obvious huge star formation clumps ( the equal mass mergers ) , while the blue cloud galaxies usually have patches of star formation ( the m51-types , shrimps , assemblies , and many antennae ) .",
    "we see now why the redshifts of the diffuse galaxies ( @xmath32 are much lower than the others : this is a selection effect for the acs camera .",
    "these tails comprise old stellar populations without star - forming clumps , and their intrinsic redness makes them difficult to see at high redshifts . also , they tend to have intrinsically low surface brightnesses because of a lack of star formation , and cosmological dimming makes them too faint to see at high redshift .",
    "hibbard & vacca ( 1997 ) note that it is difficult to detect tidal arms beyond @xmath33 .",
    "prominent star - forming clumps are apparent in many of the interacting galaxies .",
    "their sizes and magnitudes were measured using rectangular apertures .",
    "the observed magnitudes were converted to restframe b magnitudes whenever possible , using linear interpolations between the acs bands .",
    "for example , gems observations are at two filters , @xmath16 and @xmath34 .",
    "gems galaxies with redshifts @xmath22 between 0.39 ( @xmath35 ) and 0.95 ( @xmath36 ) were assumed to have restframe blue luminosities given by @xmath37 .",
    "the restframe b magnitude is then @xmath38 . for goods galaxies ,",
    "the conversions were divided into 3 redshift bins to make use of the 4 available filters , and a linear interpolation was again applied to get restframe clump magnitudes . for the goods galaxies , the restframe magnitudes determined by interpolation between the nearest 2 filters among the 4 filters are within @xmath280.2 mag of the restframe magnitudes determined from only the v and z filters .",
    "thus , the gems interpolations are accurate to this level .",
    "( we do not include corrections for intergalactic absorption in these colors , because we are comparing them directly with their parent galaxy properties .",
    "below , when we convert the colors and magnitudes to masses and ages , absorption corrections are taken into account . )",
    "the apparent restframe b magnitudes of the clumps were converted to absolute restframe b magnitudes using photometric redshifts and the distance modulus for a @xmath19cdm cosmology .",
    "these absolute clump magnitudes are shown as a function of absolute galaxy magnitude in figure [ fig : shrimf9 ] .",
    "the clump absolute b magnitudes scale linearly with the galaxy magnitudes .",
    "the clumps are typically a kpc in size ( @xmath1 to 8 pixels across ) , comparable to star - forming complexes in local galaxies ( efremov 1995 ) , which also scale with galaxy magnitude ( elmegreen et al . 1996 ; elmegreen & salzer 1999 ) .",
    "clump ages and masses were estimated by comparing observed clump colors , magnitudes , and redshifts with evolutionary models that account for bandshifting and intergalactic absorption and that assume an exponential star formation rate decay ( see elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) .",
    "internal dust extinction as a function of redshift is taken from rowan - robinson ( 2003 ) .",
    "the gems galaxy clumps only have ( v@xmath13-z@xmath15 ) colors , so the ages are not well constrained . for the goods galaxies , the additional b and i filters",
    "help place better limits on the ages , although there is still a wide range of possible fits .",
    "figure [ fig : masscol0 ] shows sample model results for redshift @xmath39 .",
    "the different lines in each panel correspond to different decay times for the star formation rate , in years : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , and the sixth line represents a constant rate .",
    "generally the shorter the decay time , the redder the color and higher the mass for a given duration of star formation .",
    "this correspondence between color and mass gives a degeneracy to plots of mass versus color at a fixed apparent magnitude ( top left ) and apparent magnitude versus color at a fixed mass ( top right ) .",
    "thus the masses of clumps can be derived approximately from their colors and magnitudes , without needing to know their ages or star formation histories .",

    "the magnitudes tend to be about constant for each redshift because of a selection effect ( brighter magnitudes are rare and fainter magnitudes are not observed ) .",
    "figure [ fig : masscol2 ] indicates that the masses of the observable clumps are between @xmath9 and @xmath44 m@xmath10 for all redshifts , with higher masses selected for the higher redshifts .",
    "the masses for all of the clumps are plotted in figure [ fig : masscol3 ] versus the galaxy type ( types 1 through 6 are in order of figs . 1 through 6 above ) .",
    "the masses are obtained from the observed values of @xmath16 and @xmath46 using the method indicated in figure [ fig : masscol2 ] .",

    "the rms values of log - mass among these six evaluations are shown in figure [ fig : masscol3 ] as plus - symbols , using the right - hand axes .",
    "these rms deviations are less than 0.2 , so the uncertainties in star formation decay times and clump ages do not lead to significant uncertainties in the clump mass .",
    "( systematic uncertainties involving extinctions , stellar evolution models , photometric redshifts , and so on , would be larger . )",
    "the clump ages can not be determined independently from the star formation decay times with only the few passbands available at high angular resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : masses2 ] shows model results that help estimate the clump ages . as in the other figures , each line is a different exponential decay time for the star formation rate .",
    "if we consider the two extreme decay times in this figure ( continuous star formation for the bottom lines in each panel and @xmath40 years for the top lines ) , then we can estimate the age range for each decay time from the observed color range . for @xmath46 colors in the range from 0 to 0.5 at low @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "fig [ fig : masscol2 ] ) , the clump ages range from @xmath40 to @xmath47 yr with continuous star formation and from @xmath40 to @xmath43 yr with a decay time of @xmath40 yrs . for colors in the range from 0 to 1.5 at higher redshifts , the age ranges are about the same in each case . for intermediate decay times , the typical clump ages are between @xmath48 years for the bluest clumps and @xmath49 years for the reddest clumps .",
    "these are reasonable ages for star formation regions , and consistent with model tail lifetimes .",
    "the star - forming complexes in the gems and goods interacting galaxies are 10 to 1000 times more massive than the local analogs seen in non - interacting late - type galaxies ( elmegreen & salzer 1999 ) , but the low mass end in the present sample is similar to the high mass end of the complexes measured in local interacting galaxies .",

    "the ngc 3628 clusters are also faint with surface brightnesses less than 27 mag arcsec@xmath11 ; they would not stand out at high redshift .",
    "it is reasonable to consider whether the observed increase of complex mass with increasing redshift is a selection effect .",
    "our clumps are several pixels in size , corresponding to a scale of @xmath51 kpc .",
    "individual clusters are not resolved and we only sample the most massive conglomerates .",
    "these kpc sizes are comparable to the complex sizes in local galaxies , but the high redshift complexes are much brighter and more massive . they would be observed easily in local galaxies .",
    "the massive complexes in our sample are more similar to those measured generally in udf galaxies ( elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) .",
    "clump separations were measured for clumps along the long arms in the shrimp galaxies of figure [ fig4shrimps ] .",
    "they average @xmath52 kpc for 49 separations .",
    "this is about the same separation as that for the largest complexes in the spiral arms of local spiral galaxies ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1983 , 1987 ) , and comparable to the spacing between groups of dust - feathers studied by la vigne et al .",
    "yet the clumps in shrimp galaxies and others studied here are much more massive than the complexes in local spiral arms , which are typically @xmath53 m@xmath4 in stars and @xmath48 m@xmath4 in gas .",
    "this elevated mass can be explained by a heightened turbulent speed for the gas , combined with an elevated gas density .",
    "considering that the separation is about equal to the two - dimensional jeans length , @xmath54 for velocity dispersion @xmath55 and mass column density @xmath56 , and that the mass is the jeans mass , @xmath57 , the mass scales with the square of the velocity dispersion , @xmath58 for fixed length @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the mass column density also scales with the square of the dispersion , @xmath61 to keep @xmath62 constant .",
    "thus the interacting tidal arm clumps are massive because the velocity dispersions and column densities are high . another way to derive",
    "this is to note that for regular spiral arm instabilities , @xmath63 is about unity at the instability threshold , where @xmath64 is the mass / length along the arm ( elmegreen 1994 ) . thus cloud mass scales with @xmath65 for constant cloud separation .",
    "high velocity dispersions for neutral hydrogen , @xmath66 km s@xmath67 , are also observed in local interacting galaxies ( elmegreen et al .",
    "1993 ; irwin 1994 ; elmegreen et al . 1995 ; kaufman et al .",
    "1997 ; kaufman et al .",
    "1999 ; kaufman et al .",
    "presumably the interaction agitates the interstellar medium to make the large velocity dispersions .",
    "the orbital motions are forced to be non - circular and then the gaseous orbits cross , converting orbital energy into turbulent energy and shocks .",
    "similar evidence for high velocity dispersions was found in the masses and spacings of star forming complexes in clump cluster galaxies ( elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) and in spectral line widths ( genzel et al .",
    "2006 ; weiner et al . 2006 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : shrimf7 ] shows the average tail surface brightness as a function of @xmath68 for galaxies in figures 1 - 4 .",
    "some systems have more than one tail .",
    "cosmological dimming causes a fixed surface brightness to get fainter as @xmath69 , so there should be an inverse correlation in this diagram . clearly , the tails are brighter for the more nearby galaxies , and they decrease out to @xmath70 , where they are fairly constant .",
    "this constant limit is at the 2@xmath20 detection limit of 25 mag arcsec@xmath11 .",
    "antennae galaxies with average tail surface brightnesses fainter than this limit have patchy tails with no apparent emission between the patches .",
    "only the brightest high redshift tails can be observed in this survey .",
    "simulations by mihos ( 1995 ) suggested that tidal tails are observable for a brief time in the early stages of a merger , corresponding to @xmath71 myr at a redshift @xmath39 and 350 myr at @xmath72 .",
    "the difference is the result of surface brightness dimming as tails disperse . a nearby galaxy merger , arp 299 , has a 180 kpc long tail encompassing 2 to 4% of the total galaxy luminosity , with an interaction age of 750 myr , but its low surface brightness of 28.5 mag arcsec@xmath11 ( hibbard & yun 1999 ) would be below the goods / gems detection limit .    the ratio of the luminosity of the combined tails and bridges to the luminosity of the disk ( the luminosity fraction ) is shown in figure [ fig : shrimf8 ] .",
    "the luminosity fraction in the tidal debris ranges from 10@xmath73 to 80@xmath73 , averaging about 30@xmath73 regardless of redshift .",
    "this range is consistent with that of local galaxies in the arp atlas and toomre sequence ( e.g. , schombert , wallin , & struck - marcell 1990 ; hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "interaction models with curled tails , as in our shrimp galaxies , were made by bournaud et al .",
    "their models had dark matter halos with masses @xmath74 times the disk mass and extents less than 12 disk scale lengths .",
    "some of our shrimp galaxies have one prominent curved arm that is pulled out from the main disk but not very far , resulting in a lopsided galaxy .",
    "simulations indicate that such lopsidedness may be the result of a recent minor merger ( bournaud et al .",
    "2005 ) . in some of our cases ,",
    "a nearby companion is obvious .",
    "the linear sizes of the tidal tails in our sample are shown in figure [ fig : shrim10 ] .",
    "they range from 2 to 60 kpc , and are typically a few times the disk diameter , as shown in figure [ fig : shrim11 ] , which plots this ratio versus redshift .",
    "the average tail to diameter ratio is @xmath75 for diffuse tails , @xmath76 for antennae , @xmath77 for m51-types and @xmath78 for shrimps , so the shrimps are about 60% as extended as the antennae types .",
    "there is no apparent dependence of these ratios on redshift in figure [ fig : shrim11 ] .",
    "projection effects make these apparent ratios smaller than the intrinsic ratios .    for comparison ,",
    "the ratio of tail length to disk diameter versus the tail length for local galaxies is shown in figure [ fig : shrimf16 ] based on measurements of antennae - type systems in the arp atlas ( 1966 ) and the vorontsov - velyaminov atlas ( 1959 ) .",
    "our galaxies are also shown .",
    "the average tail length for the local galaxies in this figure is @xmath79 kpc , while the average tail length for the gems and goods antennae is 37% as much , @xmath80 kpc .",
    "the diameters for these two groups are @xmath81 kpc and @xmath82 kpc , and the ratios of tail length to diameter are @xmath83 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "thus the local antennae mergers are larger in diameter by a factor of 2 than the gems and goods antennae , and the tails for the locals are larger by a factor of 2.7 .",
    "these results for the diameters are consistent with other indicators that galaxies are smaller at higher redshift , although usually this change does not show up until @xmath84 ( see observations and literature review in elmegreen et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "three antennae galaxies at the top of figure [ fig2bants ] , numbers 15 , 16 , and 18 , have long straight tidal arms with large star - forming regions at the ends .",
    "these clumps are possibly tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "the clump diameters and restframe b magnitudes are listed in table [ tab : dwarf ] , along with the clump in diffuse galaxy number 1 discussed in sect . [",
    "sect : sample ] . listed are their @xmath16 and @xmath46 magnitudes and associated masses , calculated as in sect .",
    "[ sect : clump ] .",
    "the masses range from @xmath85 to @xmath86 m@xmath4 for the star - forming dwarfs , but for the stellar condensation in the diffuse - tail galaxy 1 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , the mass is @xmath87 m@xmath10 .",
    "the star - forming dwarf masses are similar to or larger than those found for the tidal object at the end of the superantennae ( mirabel et al .",
    "1991 ) as well as the tidal object at the end of the tidal arm in the ic 2163/ngc 2207 interaction ( elmegreen et al .",
    "2001 ) and at the end of the antennae tail ( mirabel et al .",
    "the hi dynamical masses for these local tidal dwarfs are @xmath49 m@xmath10 .",
    "simulations of interacting galaxies that form tidal dwarf galaxies require long tails and a dark matter halo that extends a factor of 10 beyond the optical disk ( bournaud et al . 2003 ) . if one or both galaxies contain an extended gas disk before the interaction , then more massive , @xmath44 m@xmath10 stellar objects can form at the tips of the tidal arms from the accumulated pool of outer disk material ( elmegreen et al .",
    "1993 ; bournaud et al .",
    "observations of nearby interactions show clumpy regions of tidal condensations with masses of @xmath88 m@xmath10 ( bournaud et al .",
    "2004 ; weilbacher et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; knierman et al . 2003 ; iglesias - paramo & vilchez 2001 ) , like what is observed in our high redshift tidal dwarfs .",
    "no well - resolved models have yet formed tidal dwarfs from stellar debris .",
    "wetzstein , naab , & burkert ( 2007 ) considered this possibility and found collapsing gas more likely . yet the condensed object in the tail of galaxy 1 could have formed there and it is interesting to consider whether the jeans mass in such an environment is comparable to the observed mass .",
    "if , for example , the tidal arm surface density corresponds to a value typical for the outer parts of disks , @xmath74 m@xmath4 pc@xmath11 , and the stellar velocity dispersion is comparable to that required in sect .",
    "[ sect : clump ] for the gas to give the giant star forming regions , @xmath89 km s@xmath67 , then the jeans mass is @xmath90 m@xmath4 .",
    "this is not far from the value we observe , @xmath3 m@xmath4 , so the diffuse clump could have formed by self - gravitational collapse of tidal tail stars .",
    "the timescale for the collapse would be @xmath91 myr , which is not unreasonable considering that the orbit time at this galactocentric radius is at least this large .",
    "models of interacting galaxies have been used to place constraints on dark halo potentials .",
    "springel & white ( 1999 ) and dubinski , mihos , & hernquist ( 1999 ) found that tidal tail lengths can be long compared to the disk if the ratio of escape speed to rotation speed at 2 disk scale lengths is small , @xmath92 , and the rotation curve is falling in the outer disk . in a series of models , dubinski et al",
    ". showed that this condition may result from either disk - dominated rotation curves where the halo is extended and has a low concentration , or halo - dominated rotation curves where the halo is compact and low mass .",
    "dubinski et al .",
    "point out that the latter possibility is inconsistent with observed flat or rising disk rotation curves , but the first is compatible if the disk is massive and dominant in the inner regions .",
    "the first case also gives prominent bridges .",
    "in addition , springel & white ( 1999 ) found that cdm halo models with embedded disks allow long tidal tails , but dubinski et al . noted that most of those which do are essentially low surface brightness disks in massive halos , and not normal bright galaxies .",
    "galaxies without dark matter halos are not capable of generating long tidal tails ( barnes 1988 ) . in all cases ,",
    "longer tails develop in prograde interactions .",
    "the smooth diffuse types and antenna types in figures 1 and 2 have relatively long tails , so the progenitors were presumably disks of early and late types , respectively , with falling rotation curves in their outer parts .",
    "these long - tail cases are relatively rare , comprising only about 8% and 9% , respectively , of our original ( 300 galaxy ) interacting sample from gems and goods .",
    "the more compact m51 types and shrimps represent 9% and 12% of the sample .",
    "short tail interactions could be younger , less favorably projected , or have a more steeply rising rotation curve than long tail interactions .",
    "the m51 types have clear companions , so the prominent features are bridges . according to dubinski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , bridging requires a prograde interaction with a maximum - disk galaxy , that is , one with a low - mass , extended halo .",
    "mergers and interactions out to redshift @xmath93 have tails , bridges , and plumes that are analogous to features in local interacting galaxies .",
    "some interactions have only smooth and red features , indicative of gas - free progenitors , while others have giant blue star - formation clumps .",
    "the tail luminosity fraction has a wide range , comparable to that found locally .",
    "a striking difference arises regarding the tail lengths , however .",
    "the tails in our antenna sample , at an average redshift of 0.7 , are only one - third as long as the tails in local antenna mergers , and the disk diameters are about half the local merger diameters .",
    "this difference is consistent with the observations that high redshift galaxies are smaller than local galaxies , although such a drop in size has not yet been seen for galaxies at redshifts this low .",
    "the implication is that dark matter halos have not built up to their full sizes for typical galaxies in gems and goods .",
    "star formation is strongly triggered by the interactions observed here , as it is locally .",
    "the star - forming clumps tend to be much more massive than their local analogs , however , with masses between @xmath50 m@xmath10 and a few @xmath94 m@xmath4 , increasing with redshift .",
    "this is not merely a selection effect , since the massive clumps seen at high redshift would show up at lower redshift , although of course smaller clumps would not be resolved at high redshift .",
    "the clump spacings were measured along the tidal arms of the most prominent one - arm type of interaction , the shrimp - type , and found to be @xmath52 , which is typical for the spacing between beads on a string of star formation in local spiral arms . if both types of arms form clumps by gravitational instabilities , then the turbulent speed of the interstellar medium in the gems and goods sample has to be larger than it is locally by a factor of @xmath7 or more ; the gas mass column density has to be larger by this factor squared .",
    "some interactions have tidal dwarf galaxies at the ends of their tidal arms , similar to those found in the superantennae galaxy and other local mergers .",
    "one diffuse interaction with red stellar tidal debris has a large stellar clump that may have formed by gravitational collapse in a stellar tidal arm ; the clump mass is @xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "long - arm interactions are relatively rare , comprising only @xmath95% of our total sample of @xmath96 interacting systems ( only a fraction of which were discussed here ) . for those with long arms , numerical models suggest the dark matter halos",
    "must be extended , so that the rotation curves are falling in the outer disks .",
    "most interactions are not like this , however , so the rotation curves are probably still rising in their outer disks , like most galaxies locally .",
