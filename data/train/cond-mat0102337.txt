    "numerous studies of the vibrational features of superconducting cuprates have shown that some ions in the unit cell of these materials perform large  amplitude anharmonic oscillations even at low temperatures ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) . however , in some cases the results obtained by means of different experimental techniques are not in agreement .",
    "for example , both neutron  diffraction @xcite and exafs experiments @xcite reveal vibrational anharmonicity in the motion of apical oxygens . however , neutron diffraction on samples of ybco single crystals ascribes the anharmonicity to motions in the ( @xmath3 ) plane , while exafs ascribes it to the motion along @xmath4 .",
    "another example : neutron diffraction performed at 10 k on samples of rbco powders ( r= y and rare earths ) @xcite showed that the r - ion motion is practically independent of the ion s atomic number , and is consistent with normal atomic vibrations .",
    "this result has also been confirmed by neutron diffraction on samples of rbco single crystals ( r = y , ho)@xcite .",
    "however , mssbauer spectroscopy performed on samples of eubco powders measures a much larger mean square displacement ( msd ) for the eu ion @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mssbauer data on samples of eubco oriented powders , which will be presented in this paper , also confirm the large low  temperature anharmonicity of the eu ion , and show that this anharmonicity must be ascribed to the component along @xmath4 . since there is no plausible reason for the eu ion to behave differently from y and the other rare earth ions",
    ", we must conclude that mssbauer data conflict with the neutron ones .",
    "as is well known , the pairing mechanism in high-@xmath5 superconductors is not yet understood .",
    "in particular , the role played by the lattice thermal vibrations is still debated ( see _ e.g _  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hence , it is very important to deeply investigate such low - temperature anharmonicities . in order to prove their existence",
    ", the msd must be determined as a function of the temperature . for harmonic crystals ,",
    "the high temperature trend of the atomic msd extrapolates through the origin @xcite . on the contrary , if the ion moves in a non  parabolic potential , the extrapolation of the high  temperature trend intercepts the y  axis above the origin .",
    "the @xmath6 intercept provides a measure of the `` flat '' part in the potential ",
    "well bottom .    in this article",
    ", we present a study of the vibrational features of eubco as seen by using both mssbauer and exafs spectroscopies .",
    "in particular , mssbauer spectra of @xmath7eu in samples of oriented powders will be analysed , in order to investigate the anharmonic components of the motion . on the other hand ,",
    "exafs measurements at the eu k - edge make it possible to obtain the mean square relative displacements ( msrd ) of the eu ion and its neighbours . in summary ,",
    "information on the correlation among atomic motions in the unit cell can be obtained by taking into account mssbauer and exafs data .",
    "two samples of oriented single  phase powder ( samples @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and a sample of randomly - oriented single  phase powder ( sample @xmath10 ) of euba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath11 were prepared , all in the form of flat disks .",
    "the orientation was obtained by means of two different methods : ( 1 ) we mixed the finely  ground powder with epoxy resin , and shaped it in a 8 t magnetic field at room temperature . by doing this , for eubco , as for erbco , the monocrystalline grains oriented themselves with the @xmath4 axis perpendicular to the magnetic - field @xcite . ( 2 ) we shaped the powder  a mixture of euba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath11 and polyethylene  under a pressure of about 0.3 gpa , thereby orienting the grains with the @xmath4 axis in the direction of the pressure .",
    "finally , we obtained sample 3 simply by mixing the powder with epoxy resin .",
    "the orientation degree was determined by means of x  ray bragg diffraction with bragg ",
    "brentano acquisition geometry .",
    "the orientation distribution is gaussian in the cosine of the orientation angle for both samples , with standard deviations of 15@xmath12 for the magnetically oriented sample and about twice as much for the one oriented under pressure .",
    "the transition temperature for all the samples is 92 k.    we collected six spectra at the temperatures t=20 , 85 , 90 , 95 , 200 and 300 k for each sample , using a standard spectrometer with a smf@xmath1 source of 3.7 gbq at room temperature . from the analysis of the spectra , we calculated the ratio between the debye - waller factors in the @xmath4 and @xmath13 directions as functions of the temperature .",
    "we carried out this analysis for the two oriented samples , combining them with the results from the isotropic sample .",
    "we got the same value for the ratio @xmath14 in the two cases , thereby obtaining a good cross ",
    "check for the reliability of the measurement .",
    "this also provided direct evidence of consistency of data sets from the different grain  aligned samples .",
    "a detailed description of this analysis will be given elsewhere .",
    "the @xmath15 ratio turned out about 0.4 at all temperatures .",
    "this means that the motion of the eu ion is anisotropic , the amplitude in @xmath4 direction being greater than the one in the @xmath13 plane . by combining this result with the previous mssbauer measurements of the angular  averaged @xmath7eu msd @xcite , we can calculate @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the results of these calculations are plotted in fig .",
    "we note that the msd of the @xmath18component is about three times greater than the @xmath19component .",
    "moreover , the @xmath6 intercept of the high temperature trends of both components do not cross the origin .",
    "consequently , our mssbauer data show low - temperature anharmonicities , both along @xmath20 and in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "we prepared two samples of euba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single  phase powders mixed with polyethylene , with @xmath22 ( nonsuperconducting ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 k ) . for each of them , we collected trasmission eu k ",
    "edge exafs spectra at @xmath2530 , 60 , 90 , 120,180 , 250 and 300 k. the measurements were performed at the beam  line gilda crg of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) in grenoble .    the model cluster used for the exafs calculations",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] , which represents the local structure around eu in eubco up to a radial distance of 4 .",
    "the four shells included in the calculations are denoted as eu  o , eu ",
    "cu , eu  ba and eu ",
    "eu(2 ) , in order of ( their ) increasing distance from eu .",
    "actually , the exafs fourier transform shows further components above 4  , but their analysis is much less accurate .",
    "therefore , they have not been considered in fitting the experimental data .",
    "a typical exafs signal with corresponding fourier transform is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] .",
    "we carried out the data analysis by fitting the experimental spectra with the aid of the gnxas package @xcite , with distances @xmath26 and debye - waller factors @xmath27 as fitting parameters , beside the energy treshold @xmath28 used in the energy  to  wavevector conversion .",
    "we found that the average distances between europium and its neighbours do not vary appreciably ( less than 0.5% for temperatures up to 300 k ) .",
    "the trends of the msrd s are more interesting .",
    "the best fit results are reported in table  [ t.1 ] and table  [ t.2 ] for the samples with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that they lie in a range which is consistent with normal harmonic vibration ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , where the @xmath31 values for copper are reported ) . moreover",
    ", the @xmath31 s of the first two shells do not depend on the doping . on the contrary , the @xmath32 s corresponding to the ba and eu(2 ) shells",
    "are observed to be somewhat smaller for the overdoped sample .",
    "as is well known , the exafs debye ",
    "waller factors measure the broadening of the bond distances due to the thermal motions , provided the static disorder is negligible .",
    "then , denoting by @xmath33 and @xmath34 the absorber and the backscatterer msd s along the interatomic distance @xmath35 respectively , the corresponding @xmath36 is given by :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 denotes the so  called correlation parameter . if @xmath39 , the motion is highly correlated , in  phase or out  of  phase , respectively . if @xmath40 , the ionic oscillations are uncorrelated",
    "generally , a decrease of @xmath41 is expected as the interatomic distance increases .",
    "furthermore , if the debye model is a good approximation for the considered solid , @xmath38 is expected to be an increasing function of temperature .",
    "this is a consequence of the correlations , as seen by exafs , being projected onto the absorber ",
    "backscatterer bond distance , thereby being 1d correlations in their very nature  @xcite .",
    "some qualitative conclusions regarding the correlations among ion motions are drawn here as follows .",
    "let us consider the ionic radii of eu@xmath42 and o@xmath43 .",
    "we see that the two ions are practically in contact with each other  @xcite .",
    "consequently , a large positive correlation between the motions of the europium and the oxygen ions of the first shell is expected .",
    "moreover , taking into account the tight binding between the oxygen and copper ions in the cuo@xmath0 planes , a large positive correlation is also expected with the copper ions of the second shell @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we note that ba@xmath44 ions are not in contact with the inner shells .",
    "nevertheless , the corresponding measured @xmath31 show to be rather small .",
    "then , in order for these results to be consistent with the large oscillation of the eu ion along @xmath4 as measured by mssbauer spectroscopy , a large positive correlation between the two ions has to exist .",
    "finally , we can combine the mssbauer value for the @xmath45 in the @xmath21 plane with the @xmath46 to calculate @xmath47 as a function of temperatuure .",
    "unlike the normal trend , @xmath47 decreases monotonically from @xmath48 to @xmath49 as the temperature increases from 30 to 300 k.",
    "by combining the mssbauer and exafs results with the expected scenario of a large positive correlation between the motions of eu and o ions , we suggest that the ionic motions consist of large ",
    "amplitude , highly ",
    "correlated oscillations with superimposed small  amplitude , weakly  correlated , vibrations . the large  amplitude component can be described as follows .",
    "starting from the equilibrium configuration , let us imagine we displace the eu ion along @xmath4 . as a consequence , the oxygen ions will move along the line joining the eu and o centres , see fig .",
    "[ f.4 ] . but",
    "this displacement hardly changes the eu ",
    "o distance and therefore , it will not be revealed by exafs .",
    "hence , the measured @xmath50 s correspond only to the small  amplitude component .",
    "the same considerations apply to the cu ions , since their motions are closely correlated with the motions of the oxygen neighbours @xcite .",
    "the rather small values of @xmath51 measured in our experiment may seem surprising .",
    "in fact , since ba@xmath52 ions are not in contact with the inner shells , the large  amplitude oscillations of eu along @xmath4 , as measured by mssbauer spectroscopy , would result in a large  amplitude relative motion for these two ions .",
    "however , @xmath51 s are fairly small .",
    "consequently , we should conclude that the motions of barium and europium are strongly and positively correlated , despite their rather large separation .",
    "a possible explanation could be that , due to coulomb interaction between the eu@xmath53 and ba@xmath52 ions , when the former moves in a certain direction the latter is forced to move in the same direction , and _",
    "viceversa_. we also note that the large displacements of the oxygen ions result in a variation of the sum of their attractive forces on the barium ions .",
    "this , in turn , increases the correlation between europium and barium motions .",
    "to summarise , the large anharmonic oscillation includes the eu and ba motions along @xmath4 and the rotation around the cell centre of the oxygen ions of the first shell .    finally , we observe that our experiments do not reveal remarkable differences between the underdoped and overdoped samples . the @xmath50 and @xmath54 values clearly show that the relative motions of these ions are independent of the doping level . on the contrary , the @xmath51 and @xmath55 values of the overdoped sample are significantly smaller than those of the underdoped one at @xmath56",
    ". such a difference could be due to the coupling phenomenon that takes place at @xmath56 in the superconducting sample .",
    "however , in order to clarify this question , further investigations will be necessary .",
    "we also note that the observed decrease in @xmath47 as the temperature increases can not be explained within the framework of phonon theory .",
