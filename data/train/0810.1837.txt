    "understanding sliding friction between substrates separated by a thin lubricant film is technologically crucial but also rich physically  @xcite . without lubricant ,",
    "it is known that the lowest friction can be achieved for a contact of two hard crystalline solids , when the atomically flat surfaces are incommensurate ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when the surfaces are separated by a lubricant film , the lowest friction is achieved if the film is solid and crystalline but incommensurate with the substrate surface .",
    "such a situation appears in the so - called `` hard '' lubricant system @xcite , where the intermolecular interaction strength within the lubricant , @xmath0 , is stronger than the lubricant - substrate interaction , @xmath1 . in that case",
    ", the shape of lubricant molecules is not too relevant , because friction is determined uniquely by the substrate - lubricant interface structure .",
    "conventional lubricants , however , belong typically to the opposite `` soft '' lubricant type , with @xmath2 . here",
    "each substrate is covered by a glued lubricant monolayer , protecting it from wear .",
    "sliding occurs deeper inside the lubricant film , where below the film melting point a typical melting - freezing mechanism operates : the lubricant locally melts at slip ( i.e. , during sliding ) and re - solidifies at stick @xcite . for a thick lubricant film above its melting point ,",
    "e.g. , and for thicknesses larger than say ten molecular diameters , friction is proportional to the bulk viscosity of the lubricant .",
    "therefore , thick fluid lubricants consisting of simple spherical molecules or individual atoms , characterized by a low bulk viscosity , would provide the best frictional properties .",
    "indeed , experiments show that the bulk viscosity for linear molecules grows with the molecule length as was shown in ref .",
    "one could then expect that the friction coefficient of chain lubricant molecules should grow with their molecular length .    however , it is well known that long molecules often make better lubricants .",
    "the reason for this is the squeezout effect : at high load , when the regime of boundary lubrication is approached and the film is locally extremely thin , at stick the lubricant may be squeezed out in correspondence of the substrate asperities .",
    "direct contact of unlubricated asperities leads to a high static friction force @xmath3 and generally to substrate wear .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that with the increase of the alkane chain length , transitions from @xmath4 to @xmath5 lubricant layers occurs at higher pressure .",
    "longer lubricant molecules are harder to squeeze out , and this is why they provide better lubrication properties . following that line , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the `` totally - glued '' case , where all atoms of the lubricant molecule interact strongly with the substrates .",
    "longer molecules adhere more to the substrates , making it harder for the squeeze - out of the last lubricant layer to nucleate . in agreement with that ,",
    "longer alkanes perform better as boundary lubricants than shorter ones , because they prevent more effectively the appearance of cold - welded junctions and the resulting wear .",
    "tribological properties of lubricants constructed of linear ( chain ) molecules of length @xmath6 , again for the totally - glued system , were also studied with the help of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation by he and robbins @xcite .",
    "they found that at the small coverage @xmath7 ( the number of lubricant molecules @xmath8 divided by the number of substrate surface atoms @xmath9 ) the dependence of the static friction on chain length ( for @xmath10 ) is small , while for a higher coverage , @xmath11 , chains with @xmath12 and 6 show nearly the same behavior , while `` monoatomic molecules '' ( @xmath13 ) display a dramatically reduced friction ( about one fourth ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the role of molecular length in detail for a wide range of model parameters .",
    "moreover , we wish to compare a totally - glued lubricant ( with all monomers of the lubricant chain sticking to the substrates ) to a `` head - glued '' , with a single ( head ) atom of the molecule strongly attached to the substrate , while the other atoms ( molecular tail ) interact more weakly with the substrates . our aim is to clarify the role of the length of the lubricant molecules in friction , in particular to find what length of lubricant molecules could provide best tribological characteristics for a thin ( few molecular layers ) soft lubricant film .",
    "we will use the following criteria to define good tribological properties : ( i ) a better lubricant provides lower values for both the static friction force @xmath3 and the kinetic friction force @xmath14 , and ( ii ) a better lubricant is characterized by lower values for the critical velocity @xmath15 of the transition from stick - slip to smooth sliding ( or at least to provide a less irregular motion in the stick - slip regime ) .    with the aim of addressing general trends , we choose to explore a simplified two - dimensional ( 2d ) minimal model which in our view is sufficient to catch the physics of the problem , with qualitatively correct trends . in return for the model s simplicity , we will be able to span a large choice of structures and parameters .",
    "on top of that , the 2d geometry provides an easier visualization of all processes inside the lubricant .",
    "the 2d model does not describe realistically the lubricant squeezout @xcite , which requires a full three - dimensional ( 3d ) modeling , such as that employed in md simulations of ref .",
    "therefore we will not address squeezout properties any further .",

    "the substrates are modeled as two rigid chains of @xmath9 atoms and lattice spacing @xmath18 , so that the total mass of each substrate is @xmath19 and the system size in the sliding direction is @xmath20 .",
    "we apply periodic boundary condition along the @xmath16 direction .",
    "the bottom substrate is fixed at @xmath21 , while the top one is free to move in both @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions .",
    "the top substrate is pressed toward the bottom one by a @xmath22-directed constant load force @xmath23 , and is driven in the @xmath16 direction at velocity @xmath24 through an attached spring of elastic constant @xmath25 , as sketched in fig .",

[ l01 ] ) forms two complete monolayers for @xmath92 and three monolayers for @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath94 , one ordered layer sticks to the bottom substrate and another ordered monolayer to the top substrate , while the layer(s ) in between are liquid during sliding . for the monatomic lubricant , the static friction force ( not shown ) is larger than the kinetic friction by a factor of @xmath95 to @xmath96 ; the transition from stick - slip to smooth sliding occurs at @xmath97 .",

    "when the middle layer is incomplete , friction is slightly lower than for three complete monolayers , see fig .",
    "when the lubricant amount decreases further , @xmath100 , there remain only two , generally incomplete , lubricant layers , each glued to the nearest substrate ( e.g. , @xmath92 atoms form exactly two complete lubricant layers , which slide slowly , thanks to incommensurability , over the substrates to which they are attached ) . at even smaller values of @xmath28",
    "we have one monolayer or eventually just a monolayer island in the narrow gap between substrates , and at this point both the friction and the critical velocity @xmath15 grow rapidly when @xmath28 decreases .    for all chain molecules ( polymer lubricant ) @xmath101 , _ friction is always larger than for the monomer lubricant . _",
    "the kinetic friction force increases with the chain length @xmath6 , if the total number of atoms @xmath28 is kept fixed . in general , regardless of @xmath6 , friction decreases roughly monotonically with increasing @xmath28 , the lubricant thickness . in fig .",

    "unlike expectations for a fluid lubricant at high temperature , at @xmath91 the log - log plot of the function @xmath106 suggests that the simulation data may be ( crudely ) fit by power laws @xmath107 for the totally - glued case , and @xmath108 for the head - glued system .",
    "accordingly , the function @xmath109 displays a nontrivial apparent `` universal scaling '' with thickness , at least within the nanoscale thickness range considered here",
    ". the slower decay of friction compared to @xmath110 may be attributed to a non - uniformity of local heating due to sliding - induced local shear . at fixed driving velocity , the local shear decreases as thickness increases , whence the local viscosity involved increases , and so does frictional dissipation , causing a positive deviation from the fluid - like @xmath111 behavior . in other words , the higher average kinetic energy , and therefore higher effective temperature , produces a smaller viscosity @xmath102 @xcite , thus a smaller friction for a thinner lubricant layer than for a thicker one , moderating the power - law decay of @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ l02 ] . for a much thicker lubricant , a @xmath91 simulation would eventually show lubricant solidification with slip movements associated to local melting , even at the very high sliding velocity considered here",
    ".    figure  [ thicknessscaling ] reports similar calculations carried out at a finite temperature @xmath112 , compared to which the extra kinetic energy induced by shearing at sliding velocity @xmath90 becomes neglible when the lubricant thickness exceeds about @xmath113 .",
    "when the lubricant thickness exceeds such values we do observe a crossover to the expected scaling @xmath114 , as soon as the shearing kinetic energy becomes smaller than the thermal fluctuations imposed by the finite @xmath112 .",
    "note that small finite - size effects induced by the periodic simulation box tend to delay slightly the onset of the @xmath115 constant - viscosity regime .    analyzing the simulation movies for the _ totally - glued _ lubricant with @xmath101 and large enough @xmath28 we observe two complete layers sticking to the corresponding substrates and a liquid lubricant between these layers . however , not all boundary molecules are glued completely , some of them are glued partially , i.e.only a part of a molecule sticks to the substrate while another part is detached and points into the lubricant bulk .",
    "it is precisely these `` free tails '' that make the friction higher as compared with the monoatomic case . at lower lubricant thickness ( @xmath116 for the @xmath12 case",
    ", @xmath117 for the @xmath118 case , and @xmath119 for the @xmath120 system ) the middle layer is incomplete : its molecules group together at the narrowest intersubstrate gap and just ahead of it ( jamming / plowing effect ) . with a further decrease of lubricant thickness , sliding takes place at a single interface only , namely between the lubricant layers which are attached to bottom and top substrates . in this case",
    ", we observe a slow `` caterpillar '' motion of glued molecules relative the substrate , but this effect is weak because of the strong lubricant - substrate interaction . at even lower lubricant",
    "thickness occasional molecules may be glued to both surfaces simultaneously , and in such cases the molecular end sticking with fewer atoms slides along the corresponding substrate .",
    "we come now to analyze the _ head - glued _ lubricant , comparing its behavior to the totally - glued one described above , all other parameters being the same .",
    "firstly , the head - glued system ( solid symbols in figs .",
    "[ l01 ] and  [ l02 ] ) display a systematically higher friction than the totally - glued lubricant ( open symbols ) .",
    "as in the totally glued case , the surfaces are covered by lubricant layers .",
    "again , the layers are orientationally ordered : in this case the molecular heads are attached to the corresponding surface , while the tails are directed outside the surface , and inclined in the sliding direction , like combed hair . also , the sliding interface is more `` irregular '' , than in the totally - glued system .",
    "therefore , one may expect a smoother frictional motion even in the stick - slip regime at low driving velocities .",
    "it is important to note that contrary to the fully glued case , in the head - glued system we find essentially no jamming effects even at low lubricant thickness .",
    "figure  [ l04 ] depicts the different atomic density @xmath121 and velocity distributions @xmath122 and @xmath123 across the lubricant for the totally- and head - glued molecular lubricants . in both cases",
    ", one layer sticks to the substrate , but the thickness of this layer is @xmath124 in the totally - glued system and much thicker , @xmath125 , similar to the molecular gyration radius , in the head - glued case . accordingly , while the sliding profile @xmath122 is fairly linear in the totally - glued case , in the head - glued case the shearing dissipation concentrates mostly in a bulk lubricant region remote from the substrates .    to elucidate the different tribological properties of the two kinds of molecular lubricants , in fig .",
    "[ l05 ] we analyze the distribution of energy losses ( dissipated power ) due to sliding , with the method described in ref .",

    "( [ ffriction ] ) and ( [ etaprofile ] ) , mimicking the capability of different lubricant layers to transfer energy into phononic / electronic degrees of freedom of the substrates .",
    "importantly , we find that the main losses come from atomic vibrations in the transverse ( @xmath17 ) direction , by far dominant over those coming from the motion along the driving ( @xmath16 ) direction .",
    "this observation explains why , even though head - glued molecules displace sliding away from the substrates surfaces where most dissipation takes place , the head - glued system leads to a higher friction : transverse vibrations of larger amplitude penetrate better near the substrates ( where most dissipation occurs ) through head - glued molecules than through totally - glued ones .",
    "our results suggest that a totally - glued lubricant is more effective than a head - glued one , because it provides lower kinetic friction . according to sivebaek _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , totally - glued molecules with their stronger sticking to the substrate , should also be more stable against squeezout of the contact area at high load .",
    "unfortunately , as was said in the beginning , in our simplified 2d model we can not study quantitatively the squeezout process .",
    "squeezout involves nucleation of a small @xmath126 negative island or `` crater '' and its subsequent expansion , a process which also involves elasticity of the substrates , and which is very characteristically three - dimensional @xcite .",

    "[ caterpillar ] , a caterpillar - type motion indeed takes place .",
    "however , as some molecules are attached with all @xmath6 atoms but others stick only partially , e.g. , with @xmath182  atoms , while the glued layer should move as a whole ( the molecules can not overtake one another ) , caterpillar motion is disturbed , and this makes the minimum in fig .  [ l12 ] broad and shallow .",
    "the dependence of friction on the incommensurability between the substrate and molecular spacings was actually observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "we presented simulations of a simple 2d model of molecular lubrication .",
    "results indicate that layers of similar thickness of totally - glued lubricant molecules generally produce a smaller friction than lubricant molecules that are head - glued .",
    "totally - glued lubricants also stick better to the substrates , and boundary layers thereof may accordingly be harder to squeeze out under high load . on the other hand ,",
    "whenever the applied load becomes strong enough to squeeze the lubricant out to less than two molecular layers , then the head - glued kind behaves much better in sustaining smooth sliding and low friction even at very small residual coverage .",
    "we predict that when such extreme - load situations are likely to occur in a practical lubricated sliding devices , head - glued molecules could provide the best lubricant , unless the squeeze - out resistance is much worse than for totally glued lubricant .",
    "moreover , when the base lubricant is totally - glued as a typical oil and , therefore , provides low friction properties , then even a small concentration of head - glued additives such as diblock polymers may prevent the substrates from wearing at places ( asperities ) where the surfaces come close to each other within a thickness of less than two layers .",
    "this is a new result , susceptible of experimental test .",
    "similarly , friction shows a clear increasing trend as a function of molecular length ",
    "the number @xmath6 of monomer units in the molecules .",
    "this result is similar to the @xmath6 dependency of the bulk viscosity , and our results compare well to those of ref .  @xcite .",
    "this would make monoatomic liquids the best lubricants , if it was not for their much reduced resistance against squeeze - out , which eventually makes polyatomic chains more effective lubricants at loads where boundary lubrication matters .",
    "the detailed search for the best compromise between the necessity of a squeeze - out resistance , calling for large @xmath6 , and of low - friction characteristics , calling for small @xmath6 , is a rather intricate task that is probably best undertaken on a case - by - case base by experimental trial and error procedures , or possibly by very extended simulations of sophisticated 3d realistic models .",
    "the simple 2d model at hand allows us to understand the main mechanisms at play in the soft lubricant and to predict the general trends .",
    "for example , local extra heating induced by the increased lubricant shear velocity at thinnest lubricant regions between substrate corrugations may well act as an important mechanisms producing a considerable overall friction reduction in macroscopic sliding .",
