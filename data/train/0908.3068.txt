    "wetting @xcite is well exemplified by considering a liquid droplet on a substrate .",
    "depending on the physical properties of the system , determining the shape of the droplet , the substrate will be more or less wet .",
    "more specifically , the contact angle @xmath0 ( see fig . [ drops ] ) is related to the surface tensions trough young s equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the surface tensions of the substrate - vapor , substrate - liquid and liquid - vapor surfaces , respectively .",
    "total wetting happens if @xmath5 , and @xmath6 corresponds to partial wetting .",
    "cahn @xcite observed that by approaching the critical temperature @xmath7 , for @xmath8 , the liquid - vapor surface tension @xmath4 goes to zero faster than the difference @xmath9 , therefore , at a temperature @xmath10 a wetting transition should take place . in this wetting transition ,",
    "@xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath5 for @xmath13 .",
    "this observation introduced the notion that wetting could be viewed as a type of critical phenomena .",
    "more generally , a wetting transition occurs in a thermodynamic system constituted of a bulk phase @xmath14 and a substrate that attracts a second coexisting phase @xmath15 .",
    "depending on the control parameters , like e.g. temperature and chemical potential , the system will be in the moving phase or in the bound phase . at the wetting transition",
    "a macroscopic layer of the absorbed phase @xmath15 is formed and phases @xmath14 and @xmath15 coexist . in the bound phase only the phase @xmath14 is stable and the @xmath16 interface stay pinned to the wall , whereas in the moving phase the @xmath16 interface grows and only phase @xmath15 is stable .",
    "abraham @xcite introduced a two - dimensional ising model that could be solved exactly and displayed the same kind of transition predicted by cahn @xcite ; it was also shown that in the solid on solid ( sos ) limit the model still exhibited a wetting transition .",
    "the advantage of taking this limit is that it simplifies the calculations and with it several exact results can be obtained using the transfer matrix method @xcite .",
    "the sos model , defined on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions and size @xmath17 , has the following hamiltonian , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a discrete random variable representing height , @xmath20 is a positive coupling , @xmath21 is a potential accounting for the interaction between the wall ( @xmath22 ) and the absorbed phase and no overhangs are allowed .",
    "the region @xmath23 corresponds to the phase @xmath14 and the region @xmath24 to the coexisting phase @xmath15 , therefore , the height gives the position of the @xmath16 interface . by varying the temperature",

    "and wets less the substrate , in comparison to the right one with @xmath38.,width=359 ]    the kardar - parisi - zahng ( kpz ) @xcite equation differs from the ew equation by the presence of the nonlinear term @xmath39 .",
    "the basic difference of an interface described by the kpz equation ( when compared to one described by the ew equation ) is that the velocity of the interface depends on the local interface slope @xmath40 .",
    "the non - linear term comes from an expansion of the velocity with respect to the local interface slope , and it can be shown that higher order terms in the expansion are irrelevant under a renormalization group transformation @xcite . that is why the kpz equation defines a robust universality class for nonequilibrium moving interfaces .",
    "since the paper of cahn @xcite , equilibrium wetting has been intensively studied , theoretically and experimentally ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "differently , nonequilibrium wetting is in it s very beginning and experimental studies on it still lacks .",
    "one way to study it is to add the nonlinear term of the kpz equation @xmath39 to equation ( [ bew ] ) , such equation was considered for the first time by tu et al .",
    "hinrichsen et al .",
    "@xcite and muoz and hwa @xcite introduced microscopic models in the kpz universality class in the presence of a hard wall , showing that nonequilibrium wetting could also be studied with them . a considerable amount of work on nonequilibrium wetting has already emerged and our aim is to review it here .",
    "in this article we present a detailed description of nonequilibrium wetting , reviewing the very rich phenomenology that is obtained from numerical and analytical methods used to study the langevin equation and the microscopic models .",
    "two reviews on the subject , more focused on the langevin equation approach , are @xcite , and there is some overlap between them and the present one .",
    "nevertheless , in the account we make here many aspects of nonequilibrium wetting are presented in more detail , mainly when it comes to microscopic models .",
    "we also obtain a few new results that will be pointed out when they come .",
    "the review is organized in the following way . in the next section",
    "we define the langevin equations and the microscopic models to be analyzed . moreover , the quantities of interest and the exponents associated with them are defined .",
    "3 contains exact calculations , that are possible for microscopic models when detailed balance is fulfilled . in sec .",
    "4 monte carlo simulations of microscopic models and numerical integration of the langevin equations are presented .",
    "the content of sec .",
    "5 is mean field approximations for microscopic models . the case of a substrate with more",
    "than one dimension is treated in sec .",
    "6 , where mean field approximations for the continuum model , naive power - counting and some renormalization group arguments are used .",
    "we end with final remarks in sec .",
    "the langevin equation we are going to consider , describing the motion of an interface in the presence of a wall , is the bounded kpz ( bkpz ) equation , given by @xcite @xmath41 this is equation ( [ bew ] ) added with the nonlinear term @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast to the unbound kpz interface , the sign of @xmath43 is of great importance , because , as we will see , it leads to different universality classes .",
    "we call them bkpz+ and bkpz universality classes",
    ".    the potential @xmath44 has to account for the presence of a substrate and the interaction between the absorbed phase and the substrate .",
    "a natural way to consider the presence of a substrate is to forbid negative heights with a hard - wall potential , that is given by    @xmath45    the problem with this potential is that it is not suitable for calculations ( analytical and numerical ) .",
    "a potential that overcomes this problem and is used in the study of equilibrium and nonequilibrium wetting with short range interactions is @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 controls the hardness of the wall , @xmath48 is a control parameter that in equilibrium and near the transition is proportional to @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath51 the wall is repulsive and the term @xmath52 is irrelevant , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 we have an attractive wall .",
    "the order parameter of the wetting transition is @xmath55 . in the bound phase the mean height is finite and",
    "the interface stays pinned to the substrate , therefore @xmath56 . in the moving phase the mean height grows linearly with time and @xmath57 . as we will see , in the microscopic models",
    "a hard - wall is considered , and the critical behavior of them is the same as the critical behavior of the bkpz equation with the soft - wall potential ( [ 2eqvh ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the bkpz equation ( [ bkpz ] ) , with @xmath44 given by ( [ 2eqvh ] ) , can be transformed into a langevin equation with multiplicative noise .",
    "this is done with the cole - hopf transformation @xmath58 , which , in the case that the sign of the nonlinear term is negative , gives the following equation for the order parameter @xcite , @xmath59 where without loss of generality we set @xmath60 and chose to interpret the langevin equation in the stratonovich sense ( interpreting it in the ito sense would just produce a shift in the factor multiplying the linear term @xcite ) .",
    "the potential , as a function of @xmath61 , is now given by @xmath62 where the linear term @xmath63 appearing in equation ( [ mn1 ] ) is now incorporated in the potential .",
    "this equation was introduced by grinstein et al .",
    "@xcite , later it was pointed out that it was equivalent to the bkpz equation @xcite .",
    "the universality class it defines is called multiplicative noise 1 ( mn1 ) , obviously mn1 and bkpz are the same universality classes . the mn1 equation is also related to the synchronization transition in coupled map lattices @xcite , therefore , there is a relation between this transition and the wetting transition .",
    "we do not discuss this point here , references about it are @xcite .    by applying the same transformation to the bkpz+ case ( now with @xmath64 ) ,",
    "the resulting equation is @xmath65 this equation is known as the multiplicative noise 2 ( mn2 ) equation .",
    "the mn1 ( [ mn1 ] ) and mn2 ( [ mn2 ] ) equations will be very important in the course of this review , because they are more convenient in several situations .",
    "for example , integrating them numerically is simpler than integrating the bkpz equation directly , which suffers by numerical instability problems @xcite .    with this map between the bkpz equations and the mn equations it is easy to see what are the effects of considering an upper wall instead of a lower wall .",
    "an upper wall is implemented with the potential @xmath66 in equation ( [ bkpz ] ) , in this case an negative ( positive ) @xmath43 corresponds to the case of an lower wall with positive ( negative ) @xmath43 .",
    "this can be verified by performing the cole - hopf transformation , but now with @xmath67 , in the bkpz equation with an upper wall .",
    "the result is : with a positive ( negative ) @xmath43 the obtained equation is mn1 ( mn2 ) . in this review we always consider a lower wall , also in the microscopic models .    before going to the definition of the microscopic models we point out that , although the bkpz equation is defined for @xmath28 spatial dimensions , in most of this review we will restrict to the case @xmath68 , the exception being sec .",
    "6 . for this reason ,",
    "the microscopic models are defined , in the following , on a one - dimensional substrate .",
    "the model for nonequilibrium wetting described in what follows was introduced by hinrichsen et al .",
    "@xcite . it is a growth process taking place in a one - dimensional discrete lattice with periodic boundary conditions and size @xmath17 .",
    "to each site @xmath69 a random variable @xmath70 is attached , it can take the values @xmath71 and is interpreted as the interface height .",
    "nearest neighbors respect the restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) constraint , i. e. , @xmath72 which introduces an effective surface tension .",
    "the interface evolves in time by random - sequential updates in the following way . a site @xmath69 of the lattice",
    "is randomly chosen and the processes that may occur are ( see fig .  [ frates ] ) : +    * deposition of a particle ( @xmath73 ) with rate @xmath74 , + * evaporation of a particle ( @xmath75 ) at the edges of plateaus with rate @xmath76 , + * evaporation of a particle ( @xmath75 ) from the middle of a plateau with rate @xmath77 . +    if the final configuration would violate the rsos condition or would lead to a negative height , than it is not carried out .",
    "after @xmath17 attempts a monte carlo step is completed , and time is increased by one .",
    "the initial condition is a flat interface at height zero and we , without loosing generality , set @xmath78 .",
    "a hard wall is present because evaporation events at the bottom layer ( @xmath79 ) are forbidden . since this model respects the rsos condition and",
    "there is a hard - wall , we name it rsosw model .        the wetting transition can be explained as follows .",
    "consider a free interface ( negative heights are allowed ) .",
    "it may propagate , depending on the deposition and evaporation rates , in the directions of increasing or decreasing height . in the phase where the velocity of the interface @xmath80 is positive ( increasing height direction )",
    ", the presence of the wall makes no difference : after some transient the interface will propagate with the same velocity as if the wall was not present .",
    "in contrast , when the rates are such that @xmath81 , the wall changes the scenario completely because the interface stays bounded to the wall . therefore , by forbidding negative heights , a wetting transition from a bound to a moving phase takes place , and the phase transition line @xmath82 corresponds to a free interface with @xmath83 .",
    "the phase diagram of the rsosw model is displayed in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "the transition is in the direct percolation ( dp ) universality class ; for @xmath84 it is in the bkpz universality class ; for @xmath85 , where detailed balance is satisfied , it is in the bew universality class ; for @xmath86 in the bkpz+ universality class.,width=321 ]    this model was generalized by hinrichsen et al .",
    "@xcite , in order to include an attractive interaction between the substrate and the interface .",
    "this is done by considering a different deposition rate @xmath87 at zero height .",
    "because @xmath88 is smaller than @xmath74 the detachment of the interface from the substrate becomes harder and , therefore , this change in the dynamical rules simulates an attractive force between the substrate and the interface .",
    "as we will show , using microscopic models and the bkpz equation , the presence of an attractive potential leads to new physics .",
    "the sign of the factor multiplying the nonlinear term of the the kpz equation can be determined in a microscopic model . considering a initially tilted interface ,",
    "it is related to how the interface velocity varies with the tilt @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] the doted - line where @xmath89 is displayed , above ( below ) it @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this shows that for @xmath84 the phase transition is in the bkpz , for @xmath85 in the bew and for @xmath86 in the bkpz+ universality class .",
    "@xmath92 is a particular case that will be addressed in sec .",
    "another microscopic realization of nonequilibrium wetting is the so - called single - step model with a wall ( ssw ) introduced by ginelli et al .",
    "here we use a more specific version of it , studied in @xcite .    in the ssw model",
    ", the difference of height of two neighbors sites is restricted through the condition @xmath93 as in the previous model , it is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of size @xmath17 and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it evolves random - sequentially by the following rules :    * deposition of a particle ( @xmath94 ) with probability @xmath77 , + * evaporation of a particle ( @xmath95 ) with probability @xmath96 , +    at a chosen site @xmath69 occur if the configuration after the move is carried out does not violate the single - step constraint .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath97 ( @xmath22 ) if @xmath69 is odd ( even ) . in the case of the ssw model",
    "@xmath43 is proportional to @xmath98 , therefore for @xmath99 we have the bew case and for @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) the bkpz ( bkpz+ ) case .",
    "the incorporation of a wall , in comparison to the previous case , is a bit more complicated , it is done in the following way .",
    "different from the rsosw model , it is not possible to vary the velocity of the interface keeping @xmath43 fixed in the ssw model because there is just one control parameter , namely @xmath77 .",
    "fortunately , the velocity of the interface , in the long time limit , for the single - step model ( free interface case ) is known exactly ; it is given by @xmath102 therefore , in order to study nonequilibrium wetting the system is tuned to criticality by considering a wall that moves with velocity @xmath103 , given by ( [ 2veloss ] ) .",
    "this is done by forbidding evaporation events below the substrate height @xmath104 .    .",
    "on the right is the interface after the substrate moves , @xmath105.,title=\"fig:\",width=585 ] [ ssmodel ]    in this paper we attain ourselves to the cases @xmath99 , @xmath85 and @xmath92 which are in the bew , bkpz and bkpz+ universality classes , respectively . for @xmath99 , since @xmath106 , the height of the wall is @xmath107 . at @xmath85 , during a simulation , after every @xmath108 we increment the substrate height by one unity , @xmath105 .",
    "this means that all sites below the new @xmath109 have their height increased and evaporation events at the new @xmath109 are forbidden .",
    "for the bkpz+ case ( @xmath92 ) after every @xmath110 we have @xmath111 .",
    "the ssw model is particular useful to obtain critical exponents numerically , since in this case one knows the critical point exactly .",
    "on the other hand the advantage of the rsosw model is that it presents a richer behavior .",
    "the ssw model is also important in the study of mean field approximations ( see sec . [ 5 ] ) .",
    "finally , we define the physical quantities , that we are going to consider in this review , and the exponents associated with them .",
    "they are defined in the context of the rsosw model and will be generalized to the continuum model at the end of this section .",
    "the generalization to any other microscopic model is straightforward .",
    "a key quantity in what follows is the mean height of the interface , defined by @xmath112 where @xmath113 means the ensemble average .",
    "another observable of great importance is the interface width , given by @xmath114    considering an infinite system , if the interface width grows with time and does not reach a stationary value in the long time limit , the interface is called rough . otherwise , if @xmath115 saturates after some transient it is smooth . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the wetting transition is a roughening transition , the interface is smooth for @xmath116 and rough for @xmath117 . obviously , if the system is finite , even when the interface is rough , @xmath115 saturates .",
    "when one wants to verify if an interface is rough or smooth , by doing simulations in finite systems , one has to consider different sizes and see how the saturation value @xmath118 varies with @xmath17 . if @xmath118 grows with @xmath17 , than the interface is rough ;",

    "one can see that the saturation value of @xmath115 tends to a constant in the bound phase ( smooth interface ) and grows with @xmath17 in the moving phase ( rough interface).,width=359 ]    the kpz universality class describes the self - affine properties of the roughening interface under scale transformations .",
    "the scaling exponents are defined by the relations @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the time at which the interface width saturates .",
    "@xmath125 is known as the growth exponent , @xmath126 is the roughness exponent and @xmath127 the dynamical exponent .",
    "they are not all independent , but related because of the family - vicsek scaling relation @xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a scaling function . from this last relation",
    "follows that @xmath130 . in one dimension",
    "the scaling exponents of the ew universality class are @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 ; while for the kpz universality class they are @xmath131 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "we stress that the definition of the scaling exponents does not depend on the presence of the wall , they are related to the invariance of scale of @xmath115 . however , the definition of critical exponents just make sense with a wall .",
    "as we will show , by introducing a wall , only one new independent critical exponent arises , the others can be determined by scaling relations and the values of the scaling exponents .",
    "the order parameter of the wetting transition is the density of sites at zero height , i. e. , @xmath136 in the bound phase @xmath137 , while in the moving phase , where the interface detaches from the wall , @xmath138 .",

    "when dealing with a one - dimensional substrate , we consider the above definition also valid for @xmath115 .",
    "when analytical calculations are possible , we calculate both quantities and show that , indeed , they have the same critical behavior .    at the wetting transition , like the interface width , the mean height follows the relation @xmath155 . in",

    "nevertheless , the exponents @xmath133 and @xmath294 are still the same .      a method to obtain exact results , in the long time limit , for the rsos model without the wall",

    "is to measure how the critical point varies with the system size , because , as observed in @xcite , this variation is very pronounced . from relation ( [ nuperp ] ) it is expected that @xmath322 where @xmath323 is the critical point for a system of size @xmath17 and @xmath324 is the extrapolated value . with the use of this relation , fig .",

    "the interplay of these two length scales leads to other differences between the bkpz+ and bkpz universality classes , they are related to the distribution function of the distances between contact points and to the first depinning time probability distribution @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the special case @xmath92 . here",
    "the rsosw model exhibits a very different dynamics , which was introduced in @xcite and further analyzed in @xcite .",
    "this is a very particular case of the model , because , with @xmath92 , once a layer is completely filled an evaporation on it becomes impossible .",
    "hence , since the initial condition is a flat interface at height zero , the presence of the wall makes no difference .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the phase transition at @xmath92 pertains to the direct percolation ( dp ) universality class @xcite , which is the most prominent universality class of nonequilibrium phase transitions into an absorbing state @xcite .",
    "an explanation for this comes from the fact that the rsosw model at @xmath92 can be related to the contact process ( cp)@xcite . the cp is a well - known model in the dp universality class , it can viewed as a simple , and also simplistic , model for the propagation of a disease , where each site can be in two states : empty ( healthy ) or occupied by a particle ( infected ) .",
    "particles can create other particles in empty first neighbors sites ( propagation of the disease ) or die spontaneously ( cure ) .",
    "if the system has no particles ( no sick individuals ) it is in the absorbing state and the dynamics ceases .",
    "an non - exact map between the cp and the rsos at @xmath92 model was proposed in @xcite where sites with zero height are related to the infected individuals in the contact process .",
    "hence , once the first layer is filled it is analogous to enter the absorbing state in cp , since no particles in this layer can be evaporated anymore and the height zero becomes inaccessible .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the region in the phase diagram with @xmath84 can be interpreted as a dp process with an external field that destroys the transition . in the cp , an external field",
    "is introduced by allowing creation of particles at a certain rate . with it , there is no absorbing state anymore and the transition is lost . in the same way",
    "the non - zero @xmath77 destabilizes the absorbing state in the rsosw model , since even after the first layer is completely filled an evaporation on it is still possible . with this interpretation the curvature of the phase transition line , fig.[phasediagram ] ,",
    "is predicted and a crossover exponent from the dp to the bkpz universality class calculated ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the mn equations can be integrated numerically very easily by using a method introduced in @xcite to integrate langevin equations with non - additive noise .",

    "the results are : for @xmath400 the critical behavior is the same as the one obtained with short range interactions for the bkpz and bkpz+ universality classes ; for @xmath401 mean field ( in the sense that the noise is irrelevant ) critical behavior holds . these results for long range interactions",
    "were also confirmed with a microscopic model in @xcite . another microscopic model with long range interactions",
    "was previously studied in @xcite , nevertheless , as pointed out in @xcite , it does not display a mechanism that produces surface tension ( like the rsos constraint for example ) and , therefore , it is not clear if it corresponds to the bkpz equation with the potential ( [ potentiallong ] ) .",
    "one relevant point in considering long range interactions is that it may play an important role in possible experimental realizations of nonequilibrium wetting .",
    "another generalization of the problem , that can be central in an experiment , is to consider diffusion of single atoms in the interface .",

    "what was found in @xcite is that , for @xmath264 diffusion can shift the critical line but the critical behavior is still the same and at @xmath85 the critical behavior and the critical point do not change .",
    "another extension , which is not yet studied , is nonequilibrium wetting with disorder . in equilibrium",
    "wetting , the random substrate and also random bulk cases were studied , and new physical properties are born from these situations @xcite .",
    "an open problem , in the equilibrium case , is what happens to critical wetting when a random substrate is considered @xcite .",
    "in this section we present mean field approximations for the rsosw and ssw models .",
    "we first write down the master equation for surface growth models and then apply simple and pair mean field approaches in order to solve it . the first mean field approximation , for microscopic models for nonequilibrium wetting ,",
    "was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the presentation here follows the works of ginelli and hinrichsen @xcite for the ssw model and barato and de oliveira @xcite for the rsosw model .",
    "we also obtain some new results concerning pair mean field approach for the rsosw model .",
    "a stochastic process with continuous time evolves according to the master equation ( see @xcite ) , such equation reads @xmath407 where @xmath408 is the probability of being in a configuration @xmath198 at time @xmath191 and @xmath409 is the transition rate from the configuration @xmath199 to the configuration @xmath198 . in the case of surface growth models with deposition and evaporation rates depending only on height of the target site and it s nearest neighbors , the master equation becomes @xmath410 where @xmath411 is the rate for a transition from @xmath412 to @xmath413 , @xmath17 is the system size and we are considering a one - dimensional system with periodic boundary conditions .    denoting @xmath414 by @xmath415",
    "we have that for the rsosw model , where the height changes by only @xmath416 , the rates are : @xmath417 @xmath418 and @xmath419 on the other hand , for the ssw model they are non - zero only for @xmath420 and given by @xmath421 and @xmath422    in the following we denote @xmath423 by @xmath424 . the time evolution of the one - site probability distribution is obtained by summing over all heights but one in equation ( [ 4master ] ) , which gives @xmath425 for the the pair mean field approach ( see below ) we also need the time evolution of the two - site probability distribution , it is given by @xmath426    the scaling exponents of the kpz and ew universality classes are related to the interface width @xmath115 .",
    "one can make the stronger assumption that the one - site probability distribution of these universality classes , for an infinite system and in the long time limit , is given by @xmath427 where @xmath129 is a scaling function . since in the calculations that follows we always consider an infinite system in the long time limit ,",
    "when possible to solve the problem exactly , we use this ansatz for the one - site probability distribution at the wetting transition and in the moving phase .",
    "the mean field approximations we apply to the rsosw and ssw models in the following consist in approximating the probability distribution @xmath428 by a ( simple or pair ) factorized form so that the master equation becomes tractable .",
    "they are applied to one - dimensional models and expected to capture some features of them , they are not expected to become valid above some critical dimension .        in simple mean field ,",
    "terms like @xmath429 are approximated by their factorized form , i.e. , @xmath430 note that this approximation does not take the rsos constraint into account .",
    "for example , the probability @xmath431 is zero in the original problem and in the simple mean field approach it is simple given by @xmath432 .    with this approach the master equation for the one site probability distribution ( [ 4master1 ] ) for the rsosw model acquires the following simpler form , @xmath433 where @xmath434 denotes the one - site probability distribution , @xmath435 and @xmath436 ( in order to account for the presence of the wall at height zero ) .",

    "one can carry out the calculation that follows with general @xmath254 and then verify it with the final result .",
    "since we are interested in this limit we proceed with the calculations setting @xmath455 .    at the critical point",

    "since the term proportional to @xmath48 goes to zero in the moving phase , the bkpz equation is equivalent to the kpz equation in the moving phase , the flow diagram is similar to the well - known kpz one @xcite : above the critical dimension @xmath580 there is a weak - noise attractive fixed point , where @xmath583 , and a strong - noise repulsive fixed point .",

    "this was verified with numerical integration of the mn1 equation for @xmath584 in @xcite .",
    "another important point about the perturbative expansion is that changing @xmath376 , the hardness of the wall , does not introduce new divergences and therefore it is not expected to affect the critical behavior @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with numerical results and different from the mean field result that predicts an exponent depending on @xmath376 in the weak noise regime .",
    "the critical behavior at the critical dimension @xmath585 can not be determined by perturbation theory .",

    "the critical exponents @xmath148 ( or @xmath316 ) of the bkpz universality classes in two dimensions are not known .",
    "the renormalization group flow equations can be derived in an alternative way without writing down the action , but direct from the langevin equation . for the mn1 equation",

    "what was not yet studied is nonequilibrium wetting with disorder , which can be very relevant in a experimental situation . also relevant in possible experimental realizations ,",
    "is to consider nonequilibrium wetting in a two - dimensional substrate .",
    "the critical exponents of the bkpz universality class in @xmath585 were not yet determined . performing monte carlo simulations with microscopic models or numerical integration of the langevin equation at @xmath585",
    "is a trivial task , the main problem is to find some approximative method that can support the results obtained with simulations .",
    "the main challenge , in what we defined here as nonequilibrium wetting , is to observe experimentally the critical behavior obtained theoretically .",
    "any growing interface in the presence of a wall and under nonequilibrium conditions is , in principle , a candidate of an experimental realization of the bkpz universality classes .",
    "following the discussion in @xcite good candidates may come from crystal growth and synchronization transitions in extended one - dimensional systems .",
