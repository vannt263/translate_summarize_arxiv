    "for example for all positive integers @xmath122 , the braid @xmath123 is not considered since its closure is the braid index two torus knot @xmath124 .",
    "if @xmath125 holds for a positive @xmath26-braid @xmath1 , then one also has @xmath126 for all positive integers @xmath90 since gambaudo and ghys established that @xmath127 for all @xmath26-braids @xmath1 and all integers @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to establish   for positive @xmath26-braids @xmath1 with @xmath28 and @xmath128 , or @xmath26 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath119 . after possibly a conjugation , we have that @xmath129 is given by a braid word starting with @xmath79 and ending with @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath130 for some odd integer @xmath131 , where for all @xmath132 the @xmath133 are integers larger than or equal to @xmath96 .",

    "this is possible by making saddle moves that ` separate ' all but one of the @xmath137-blocks as illustrated in figure  [ fig : saddlemoveonalpha ] .",
    "thus , we have @xmath138 and , therefore , we get @xmath139    if @xmath140 , we can assume ( after possibly a conjugation ) that @xmath141 with @xmath142 for some even integer @xmath143 , where for all @xmath132 the @xmath133 are integers larger than or equal to @xmath96 .",

    "thus , we have @xmath146 and , therefore , we get @xmath147    similar arguments work for @xmath148 or @xmath26 . a small difference occurs : the link @xmath3 will be a connected sum of braid index two torus knots and @xmath149 for some positive integer @xmath122 ( instead of just braid index two torus knots ) ; however , @xmath150 ( see for example  @xcite ) and so the argument remains the same .",
