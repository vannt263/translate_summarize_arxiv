    "the nature of human driving behaviour and the differences with the automated driving implemented in most micromodels is a controversial topic in traffic science @xcite .",
    "finite reaction times and estimation capabilities impair the human driving performance and stability compared to automated driving , sometimes called ` adaptive cruise control ' ( acc ) . however ,",
    "unlike machines , human drivers routinely scan the traffic situation several vehicles ahead and anticipate future traffic situations leading , in turn , to an increased stability .",
    "the question arises , how this behaviour affects the overall driving behaviour and performance , and whether the stabilizing effects ( such as anticipation ) or the destabilizing effects ( like reaction times and estimation errors ) dominate , or if they effectively cancel out each other .",
    "the answers to these questions are crucial for determining the influence of a growing number of vehicles equipped with automated acceleration control on the overall traffic flow . up to now",
    ", there is not even clarity about the sign of the effect .",
    "some investigations predict a positive effect @xcite , while others are more pessimistic @xcite .",
    "single aspects of human driving behaviour have been investigated in the past .",
    "for example , it is well known that traffic instabilities increase with the reaction times @xmath0 of the drivers .",
    "finite reaction times in time - continuous models are implemented by evaluating the right - hand side of the equation for the acceleration ( or velocity ) at some previous time @xmath1 with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "reaction times in time - continuous models have been modelled as early as 1961 by newell @xcite . recently",
    ", the optimal - velocity model ( ovm ) @xcite has been extended to include finite reaction times @xcite",
    ". however , the newell model has no dynamic velocity , and the ovm with delay turns out to be accident - free only for unrealistically small reaction times @xcite .    to overcome this deficiency , davis @xcite has introduced ( among other modifications ) an anticipation of the expected future gap to the front vehicle allowing accident - free driving at reaction times of 1 s. however",
    ", reaction times were not fully implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite since the own velocity , which is one of the stimuli on the right - hand side of the acceleration equation , has been taken at the actual rather than at the delayed time .",
    "another approach to model temporal anticipation consists in including the acceleration of the preceding vehicles in the input variables of the model . for cellular automata ,",
    "this has been implemented by introducing a binary - valued ` brake light ' variable @xcite .    to our knowledge",
    ", there exists no car - following model exhibiting platoon stability ( with respect to all stimuli ) for reaction times exceeding half of the time headway of the platoon vehicles .",
    "human drivers , however , accomplish this task easily : in dense ( not yet congested ) traffic , the most probable time headways on german freeways are 0.9 - 1s @xcite which is of the same order as typical reaction times @xcite .",
    "however , single - vehicle data for german freeways @xcite indicate that some drivers drive at headways as low as 0.3 s , which is below the reaction time of even a very attentive driver by a factor of at least 2 - 3 @xcite . for principal reasons",
    ", therefore , safe driving is not possible in this case when considering only the immediate vehicle in front .",
    "this suggests that human drivers achieve additional stability and safety by taking into account next - nearest neighbors and further vehicles ahead as well .",
    "such ` spatial anticipation ' or ` multi - anticipation ' has been applied to the ovm @xcite and to the gipps model @xcite as well as to some cellular automata model @xcite . as expected ,",
    "the resulting models show a higher stability than the original model . however , the stability of the aforementioned models is still smaller than that of human driving",
    ". furthermore , they display unrealistic behaviour such as clustering in pairs @xcite , or too elevated propagation velocities of perturbations in congested traffic ( @xmath3 km / h ) @xcite .",
    "imperfect estimation capabilities often serve as motivation or justification to introduce stochastic terms into micromodels such as the gipps model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "most cellular automata require fluctuating terms as well . in nearly all the cases ,",
    "fluctuations are assumed to be @xmath4-correlated in time and acting directly on the accelerations .",
    "an important feature of human estimation errors , however , is a certain _ persistency_. if one underestimates , say , the distance at time @xmath5 , the probability of underestimating it at the next time step ( which typically is less than 1 s in the future ) is high as well .",
    "another source leading to temporally correlated acceleration noise lies in the concept of ` action points ' modelling the tendency of human drivers to actively adapt to the traffic situation , i.e. , to change the acceleration only at discrete times @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the human driver ( meta-)model ( hdm ) in terms of four extensions to basic physics - oriented traffic models incorporating into these models ( i ) finite reaction times , ( ii ) estimation errors , ( iii ) spatial anticipation , and ( iv ) temporal anticipation .",
    "the class of suitable basic models is characterized by continuous acceleration functions depending on the velocity , the gap , and the relative velocity with respect to the preceding car and includes , for example , the optimal - velocity model ( ovm ) @xcite , the gipps model @xcite , the velocity - difference model @xcite , the intelligent - driver model ( idm ) @xcite , and the boundedly rational driver model @xcite .    for matters of illustration",
    ", we will apply the hdm to the intelligent - driver model @xcite , which has a built - in anticipative and smooth braking strategy , and which reaches good scores in a first independent attempt to benchmark micromodels based on real traffic data @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we will formulate the hdm in terms of the acceleration function of the basic model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we will simulate the stability of vehicle platoons as a function of the reaction time @xmath0 and the number of anticipated vehicles @xmath6 . we find string stability for arbitrarily long platoons for reaction times of up to 1.5 s. furthermore , we simulate the macroscopic traffic dynamics for an open system containing a flow - conserving bottleneck @xcite .",
    "we find that multi - vehicle anticipation ( @xmath7 ) can compensate for the destabilizing effects of reaction times and estimation errors .",
    "the numerically determined phase diagram for the corresponding parameter space gives the conditions under which simple physical models describe the traffic dynamics correctly . in the concluding section [ sec : diss ]",
    ", we suggest applications and further investigations and discuss some aspects of human driving that are not included in the hdm .",
    "let us formulate the hdm as a meta - model applicable to time - continuous micromodels ( car - following models ) of the general form @xmath8 where the own velocity @xmath9 , the net distance @xmath10 , and the velocity difference @xmath11 to the leading vehicle serve as stimuli determining the acceleration @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this class of basic models is characterized by ( i ) instantaneous reaction , ( ii ) reaction only to the immediate predecessor , and ( iii ) infinitely exact estimating capabilities of drivers regarding the input stimuli @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , which also means that there are no fluctuations . in some sense , such models describe driving behaviour similar to adaptive cruise control systems .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to single - lane longitudinal dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we will not include adaptations of drivers to the traffic conditions of the last few minutes .",
    "this so - called ` memory effect ' is discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a reaction time @xmath0 is implemented simply by evaluating the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ mic ] ) at time @xmath1 . if @xmath0 is not a multiple of the update time interval , we propose a linear interpolation according to @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes any quantity on the right - hand side of ( [ mic ] ) such as @xmath10 , @xmath9 , or @xmath11 , and @xmath18 denotes this quantity taken @xmath19 time steps before the actual step . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the integer part of @xmath20 , and the weight factor of the linear interpolation is given by @xmath21 .",
    "we emphasize that _ all _ input stimuli @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 are evaluated at the delayed time .",
    "notice that the reaction time @xmath0 is sometimes set equal to the ` safety ' time - headway @xmath22 .",
    "it is , however , essential to distinguish between these times conceptually .",
    "while the time headway @xmath22 is a characteristic parameter of the driving style , the reaction time @xmath0 is essentially a physiological parameter and , consequently , at most weakly correlated with @xmath22 .",
    "we point out that both the time headway @xmath22 and the reaction time @xmath0 are to be distinguished from the numerical update time step @xmath23 , which is sometimes erroneously interpreted as a reaction time as well .",
    "for example , in our simulations , an update time step of 2 s has about the same effect as a reaction time of 1 s while the results are essentially identical for any update time step below 0.2 s.      we will now model estimation errors for the net distance @xmath13 and the velocity difference @xmath15 to the preceding vehicle .",
    "since the velocity itself can be obtained by looking at the speedometer , we neglect its estimation error . from empirical investigations ( for an overview see @xcite , p. 190 ) it is known that the uncertainty of the estimation of @xmath15 is proportional to the distance , i.e. , one can estimate the time - to collision ( ttc ) @xmath24 with a constant uncertainty @xcite . for the distance itself",
    ", we specify the estimation error in a relative way by assuming a constant variation coefficient @xmath25 of the errors .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to other stochastic micromodels @xcite , we take into account a finite persistence of estimation errors by modelling them as a wiener process @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following nonlinear stochastic processes for the distance and the velocity difference , @xmath26 @xmath27    where @xmath28 with @xmath29 is the variation coefficient of the distance estimate , and @xmath30 , a measure for the average estimation error of the time to collision .",
    "the stochastic variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 obey independent wiener processes @xmath33 of variance 1 with correlation times @xmath34 defined by @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36    in the explicit numerical update from time step @xmath5 to step @xmath37 , we implemented the wiener processes by the approximations @xmath38 where the @xmath39 are independent realizations of a gaussian distributed quantity with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "we have checked numerically that the update scheme ( [ wienernum ] ) satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath40 for any update time interval satisfying @xmath41 .",
    "simulations have shown that , in agreement with expectation , traffic becomes more unstable with increasing values of @xmath25 and @xmath42 . to compare the influence of the temporally correlated multiplicative hdm noise with more conventional white acceleration noise",
    ", we have repeated the simulations of section [ sec : results ] with the deterministic hdm ( @xmath43 ) augmented by an additive noise term @xmath44 at the right - hand side of the acceleration equation .",
    "remarkably , the dynamics did not change essentially for reasonable values of the fluctuation strength @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the more detailed representation of stochasticity by the hdm can be used to relate the conventional noise strength @xmath46 ( which does not have any intuitive meaning ) to better justified noise sources .",
    "we will assume that drivers are aware of their finite reaction time and anticipate the traffic situation accordingly .",
    "besides anticipating the future distance @xcite , we will anticipate the future velocity using a _ constant - acceleration heuristics_. the combined effects of a finite reaction time , estimation errors and temporal anticipation leads to the following input variables for the underlying micromodel ( [ mic ] ) : @xmath47 with @xmath48_{t - t'},\\ ] ] @xmath49_{t - t'},\\ ] ] and @xmath50 we did not apply the constant - acceleration heuristics for the anticipation of the future velocity difference or the future distance , as the accelerations of other vehicles can not be estimated reliably by human drivers .",
    "instead , we have applied the simpler _ constant - velocity heuristics _ for these cases .",
    "notice that the anticipation terms discussed in this subsection ( which do not contain any additional model parameters ) are specifically designed to compensate for the reaction time by means of plausible heuristics .",
    "they are to be distinguished from ` anticipation ' terms in some models aiming at collision - free driving in ` worst - case ' scenarios ( sudden braking of the preceding vehicle to a standstill ) when the braking deceleration is limited .",
    "such terms typically depend on the velocity difference and are included , e.g. , in the gipps model , in the idm , and in some cellular automata @xcite , but notably not in the ovm .",
    "the hdm is most effective when using a basic model with this kind of anticipation .",
    "let us now split up the acceleration of the underlying microscopic model into a single - vehicle acceleration on a nearly empty road depending on the considered vehicle @xmath51 only , and a braking deceleration taking into account the vehicle - vehicle interaction with the preceding vehicle : @xmath52 notice that this decomposition of the acceleration has already been used to formulate a lane - changing model for a wide class of micromodels @xcite .",
    "next , we model the reaction to several vehicles ahead just by summing up the corresponding vehicle - vehicle pair interactions @xmath53 from vehicle @xmath54 to vehicle @xmath51 for the @xmath55 nearest preceding vehicles @xmath54 : @xmath56 where all distances , velocities and velocity differences on the right - hand side are given by ( [ s_est ] ) - ( [ dv_est ] ) .",

    "the dynamic part implements an accident - free ` intelligent ' braking strategy that , in nearly all situations , limits braking decelerations to the ` comfortable deceleration ' @xmath67 .",

    "these states were caused by intersections acting as bottlenecks .    to obtain the spatiotemporal dynamics shown in these plots ,",
    "we have applied the adaptive smoothing method ( asm ) @xcite to the lane - averages of the velocity data .",
    "the smoothing times and lengths of the asm are set to the values used for the averaging filter in the simulation , i.e. , to 1 min and 0.4 km , respectively .",

    "traffic is essentially non - oscillatory in a region of about 1 km width near the bottleneck ( this is sometimes called the ` pinch region ' @xcite ) , 4 .   further upstream , the congested traffic consists of stop - and - go waves propagating upstream at a constant velocity @xmath137 , 5 .",

    "[ figempstates ] .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the destabilizing effects of finite reaction times can be compensated to a large extent by spatial and temporal anticipation such that the resulting stability and dynamics are similar to the case of the idm with zero anticipation and reaction time . however , besides stability issues , the hdm simulation results agree better with empirical traffic data in the following aspects : ( i ) compared to the underlying idm , the hdm simulation shows larger oscillation periods in the case of oct and , generally , lower velocity gradients .",
    "( ii ) coexisting plcs and mlcs are observed both in the hdm and in real traffic data @xcite , but not in the idm .",
    "( iii ) near the bottleneck , the hdm regularly produces traffic of relatively high flow and density ( pinch region ) .",
    "finite reaction times and errors in estimating the input variables are clearly essential factors of driver behaviour affecting the performance and stability of vehicular traffic .",
    "however , these aspects are rarely considered in physics - oriented traffic modelling .",
    "nevertheless , the simple models used by physicists such as the optimal - velocity model and its generalizations @xcite , the velocity - difference model @xcite , or the idm allow to describe many , particularly macroscopic , aspects of traffic dynamics such as the spatiotemporal dynamics of the various types of traffic congestion , the propagation of stop - and - go traffic , or even the scattering of flow - density data points of ` synchronized traffic ' @xcite .",
    "the question arises why , despite their obvious shortcomings , these models work so well .",
    "this question became more pressing after it turned out that all of the above models ( including the idm ) produce unrealistic dynamics and crashes when simulating these models with realistic reaction times ( of the order of 1 s ) .    in this work",
    ", we have shown that the destabilizing effects of reaction times and estimation errors can be compensated for by spatial and temporal anticipations : one obtains essentially the same longitudinal dynamics , which explains the good performance of the underlying simple models . in order to put this balance of stabilizing and destabilizing effects into a more general context ,",
    "we have formulated the human - driver model ( hdm ) as a meta - model that can be used to extend a wide class of car - following models , where the acceleration depends only on the positions , velocities and accelerations of the own and the preceding vehicle . by applying the hdm extensions to the idm",
    ", we have provided quantitative details of the balance conditions and the remaining differences in the dynamics .",
    "this involves validity criteria for the applicability of simpler physics - oriented car - following models .",
    "since the basic models have both the advantages and limitations of adaptive cruise control ( acc ) systems , one can investigate the impact of acc vehicles on the capacity and stability of the overall traffic simply by simulating a mixture of , e.g. , idm and hdm vehicles .",
    "furthermore , one gets the nontrivial result that hypothetical future traffic consisting predominantly of automated vehicles will exhibit macroscopic dynamics similar to that of the actual traffic , although the driving strategy would be markedly different .",
    "while finite reaction times have been investigated for more than 40 years @xcite the hdm - idm combination is , to our knowledge , the first car - following model allowing accident - free driving at realistic accelerations in all traffic situations for reaction times of the order of and even exceeding the time headway",
    ". a closer look at quantitative features of stop - and - go traffic or oscillations shows that , compared to simulations of the original idm , the hdm extensions reduce the gradients of transitions between free and congested traffic and increase the wavelengths of stop - and - go waves , in agreement with empirical data .",
    "this suggests that multi - anticipation is an essential aspect of the driver behaviour .",
    "a comparison of the stochastic hdm expressions for imperfect estimation capabilities with other stochastic micromodels is in order .",
    "while fluctuating terms were first introduced to traffic models more than 20 years ago @xcite , the most prominent example of stochastic traffic models are cellular automata ( ca ) of the nagel - schreckenberg type @xcite and extensions thereof .",
    "there is , however , a qualitative difference compared with most continuous models : fluctuation terms change the qualitative dynamics of many ca models .",
    "therefore , they must be carefully chosen to yield plausible results .",
    "in contrast , the qualitative dynamics typically remains the same when fluctuations are added to car - following models _ via _ the hdm extensions .",
    "having modelled the estimation errors by a stochastic wiener process with a finite correlation time , we have included the persistence of estimation errors for a certain time interval .    the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ figphasediagramtrafficstates ] contained qualitatively the same spatiotemporal congested states as found in refs . @xcite . at first sight",
    ", this seems surprising . besides using a different model , the control parameters making up the phase space were extrinsic in the previous work , while the phase space is spanned by intrinsic model parameters in the present work .",
    "a closer look at the analytic expressions for the phase boundaries @xcite containing both extrinsic flow parameters and intrinsic stability limits indicates that variations of both kinds of control parameters can lead to phase transitions .    from a control - theoretical point of view",
    ", the hdm extensions implement a continuous response to delayed and noisy input stimuli .",
    "alternatively , human driving behaviour can be modelled by so - called action - point models , where the response changes discontinuously whenever certain boundaries in the space spanned by the input stimuli are crossed @xcite , but these thresholds can not easily confirmed by empirical data .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that , in this work , we have considered only longitudinal aspects of human driving ( acceleration and deceleration ) and implemented only identical driver - vehicle units .",
    "platooning effects due to different driving styles and the remarkable ability of human drivers to safely and smoothly change lanes even in congested conditions are the topic of a forthcoming paper .",
