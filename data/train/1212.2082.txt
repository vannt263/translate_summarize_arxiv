    "the fixed points are stable to small perturbations , with frequencies @xmath144 \\ , .\\ ] ] the frequencies are always real - valued .",
    "thus , all the @xmath145 cw solutions are stable within the continuous wave framework ( i.e. , not considering modulational instabilities , which due to length is deferred to another paper ) . physically , these are the frequencies of oscillatory coherent spin mixing @xcite .",
    "this oscillation is not the same as that in refs .",
    "@xcite and@xcite . in those papers ,",
    "the frame of reference can be rotated such that the solutions have no bec component with spin @xmath115 .",
    "the governing equations then reduce to two coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations , without any parametric terms that either mix the spin components or lock their frequencies ( chemical potentials ) together .",
    "if such solutions are viewed in a rotated reference frame that mixes the spin components , there is an oscillation due to the beating of one frequency and wavenumber against another .",
    "the oscillations with frequencies  ( [ cw : n0n1.oscillations ] ) , in contrast , can not be eliminated by a change in the variables .",
    "there is just one oscillatory frequency for a given near - cw solution .",
    "one could rotate such a near - cw solution with a small oscillation into another reference frame , and get oscillations as in refs .",
    "@xcite _ on top of _ the frequency  ( [ cw : n0n1.oscillations ] ) of the small variations about the fixed point . the oscillations in refs .",
    "@xcite can be affected by linear zeeman splitting ; the oscillation frequencies  ( [ cw : n0n1.oscillations ] ) are independent of it .",
    "we obtained the most general continuous wave ( plane wave ) solutions for spinor becs for spin @xmath0 , with linear and quadratic zeeman splitting due to a magnetic field .",
    "we do not make the assumption that the wavenumbers of the different spin components are all the same .",
    "the physics only requires that cw solutions have wavenumbers and frequencies in the @xmath115 fields that are the average of the quantities in the @xmath118 fields .",
    "there are three distinct families of cw solutions .",
    "the first family are the solutions in which the @xmath22 spin component vanishes .",
    "the second and third families of cw solutions have non - zero densities of particles with spin @xmath146 . the second and third families of solutions",
    "are distinguished from each other by the phase of the @xmath115 bec field with respect to the average phase of the @xmath118 bec fields .",
    "other things being equal , the different phases in the @xmath115 fields give the cw solutions different densities of spin @xmath115 particles .",
    "the third family does not allow all the wavenumbers to be identical ; in this limit , the density of @xmath115 particles is asymptotically large .",
    "the first family of solutions , without spin @xmath115 particles , is governed by the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations , which have been studied in great detail .",
    "the solutions of the second and third type depend on whether the bec is ferromagnetic or polar ( antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "there are always cw solutions of the first type , and there is always at least one solution of the second or third type .",
    "the linear zeeman splitting term , with a constant uniform magnetic field , can be eliminated by a gauge transformation , so it does not change the dynamics .",
    "quadratic zeeman splitting can not be eliminated , and has nontrivial effects .",
    "if the quadratic zeeman coefficient is positive ( which is the usual case for @xmath0 particles ) , it s effects on the cw solutions are similar to the effects of a difference in the wavenumbers in the spin components . if the quadratic zeeman coefficient is negative ( which can be achieved by using microwaves and the stark effect ) , a sufficiently large magnetic field can made the cw solutions in the @xmath0 spinor bec switch from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic and _ vice versa_.    the cw solutions of the second and third families are stable to small perturbations within the cw ansatz .",
