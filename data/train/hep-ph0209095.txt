    "multiquark exotic hadrons different from the ordinary mesons or baryons have been discussed and searched for many years @xcite . motivated by the possible discovery of doubly charmed @xmath1 baryons , @xcite , we reconsider the @xmath4 tetraquark  the doubly charmed exotic state .",
    "we find that such a @xmath5 state is likely to exist below or near the @xmath6 thresholds , and may be the first stable / narrow exotic state to be discovered .",
    "let @xmath8 denote a putative tetraquark state ( it is denoted as @xmath9 in @xcite ) consisting of two heavy quarks@xmath10 or @xmath11and two light quarks@xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in genuine four quark `` one bag states '' with a `` connected color network '' .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] indicates one such state where @xmath13 are combined via @xmath14 into @xmath15 color diquark , and @xmath16 make an @xmath17an anti - diquark .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 combine to give an overall color singlet state .",
    "note that according to the well - known arguments , @xcite , in the large @xmath20 limit such a four - quark state is unstable against a decay into the two mesons , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for instance .",
    "alternatively , however , one can assume that the state @xmath23 in the large @xmath20 limit corresponds to the state containing @xmath24 heavy quarks , which combine into @xmath25 representation of @xmath26 color , and @xmath27 light quarks combined into @xmath28 . according to the standard large @xmath20 counting rules the binding energy of such a @xmath29-exotic state , @xcite , is of order @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ of the same order as the meson masses .",
    "the identity @xmath31 allows one to express the above tetraquark state as a superposition of two meson states , @xmath32 etc .",
    ", which are separately color singlets .",
    "@xmath33 if the @xmath34 ( and @xmath35 ) colors are coupled symmetrically to @xmath36 ( and @xmath37 ) the analog of the eq .",
    "( [ identity ] ) will have a plus relative sign .    in a `` string picture ''",
    "the chromoelectric fluxes are squeezed into thin `` vortices '' connecting the various ( anti)quarks and/or junction points . in this case the various lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] describe not only the color coupling but also the actual layout of the strings .",
    "the transition between the tetraquark ( color connected``one - bag '' state ) to the two - meson state can be pictorially described by shrinking the string bit connecting the two junctions , and then annihilating them via the above @xmath38 contraction ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this naively would suggest the two - meson state , in which the above string bit has been eliminated , is lighter than the tetraquark state rendering the latter unstable since @xmath39 would be kinematically allowed",
    ".    however , the naive string picture may not apply to the ground state hadron considered here .",
    "indeed we can directly show that @xmath40 _ is stable _ in the heavy quark limit ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 would then bind into a @xmath44 via the perturbative one gluon exchange .",
    "the essentially coulombic interaction yields a binding energy @xmath45 ( for @xmath46 ) . once @xmath47 is sufficiently large this binding exceeds hadronic energy scales and possible bindings in the heavy - light @xmath48 mesonic systems .",
    "this then ensures the stability against decay into two such mesons .",
    "unfortunately for this mechanism to generate stable tetraquarks @xmath47 ( much ) larger than ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 is required .",
    "detailed , and to some extent model dependent , considerations are thus required to motivate a @xmath0 state near or below @xmath51 threshold .",
    "an alternative approach , which can directly address the stability of the physical @xmath52 ( @xmath0 ) state against a decay into @xmath3 or @xmath53 , starts with these charmed mesons and attempts to form bound states via the potential due to light mesons , particularly one - pion exchange .",
    "following t@xmath54rnqvist , @xcite we will call such `` deutron like '' or `` molecular '' bound states of two mesons , `` deusons '' .",
    "the ranges and strengths of such potentials are independent of @xmath47 since @xmath55 or @xmath56 couplings , for instance , depend only on the light quark degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , if the two heavy mesons are attracted by these potentials , binding is again guaranteed in the heavy quark limit as the kinetic energy and centrifugal barriers for @xmath57 waves vanish like @xmath58 .",
    "previous calculations utilizing opep ( one - pion exchange potential ) disagree on this issue .",
    "thus t@xmath54rnqvist @xcite finds @xmath60 , @xmath59 and even @xmath61 bound states whereas manohar and wise @xcite find only @xmath62 bound states .",
    "the difficulty stems from the fact that much of the binding is due to the short range part of the potential .",
    "channel has the form : @xmath63 with @xmath64 in @xmath65 and @xmath66 in @xmath67 .",
    "averaging over the polarizations we get an expression like @xmath68 .",
    "the second piece becomes negligible as @xmath69 ( except at @xmath70 ) and the first piece contributes in configuration space a @xmath71-function which clearly can not be utilized in a reliable way for binding an extended object of interest . ]",
    "the derivative pion coupling generates in the tensor part of the opep a @xmath72 term which is singular at short distance . cutting off the opep at some distance @xmath73",
    "is therefore required .",
    "the fact that manohar and wise ( conservatively ( ? ) ) chose @xmath74 and t@xmath54rnqvist ( boldly ( ? ) ) takes @xmath75 is the likely reason for their disagreement on bound @xmath59 deusons .",
    "we do not believe that this issue can be settled . yet the fact that the binding of this system by opep alone is not guaranteed may make the problem even more interesting . to decide the issue of a physical bound state with @xmath76 flavor we may need the genuine four quark``one bag '' component of the state  where nontrivial aspects of qcd are operative",
    "indeed , once the distance between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons defined , say , by the distance between the respective charmed quarks , is smaller than the size of @xmath21 or @xmath22 we can no longer treat the system as two separate hadrons exchanging light mesons .",
    "rather , we need to revert to the `` one bag '' tetraquark description .",
    "the various quark-(anti)quark interactions in this state may then supply just the extra attractive interaction at ( relatively ) short distances needed in order to bind the system .",
    "the same physical @xmath76 state would then be a @xmath23 at short distances , @xmath77 and a @xmath78 deuson for @xmath79 .",
    "neither deusons nor tetraquarks are true ground states .",
    "the basic variational principle implies that mixing will _ lower _ the true ground state energy below the lowest energies found in each sector separately .",
    "lacking a consistent first principle computational framework we appeal to the vast existing lore and literature . thus to approach",
    "the problem of `` color connected single bag '' states one utilizes : + i ) `` constituent '' massive quarks @xmath80 , @xmath81 ; + ii ) appropriate @xmath82 long range interactions , or alternatively , an overall bag which confines the quarks into a single state ; + iii ) the chromomagnetic hyperfine pairwise interactions : @xmath83 where @xmath84/@xmath85 are the spin / color matrices of the ( anti)quarks , and `` @xmath86 '' is the relative wave function at zero separation for a @xmath87 meson and more generally the probability of overlap of the two ( anti)quarks considered .    rather than attempting an _ ab initio _ calculation we adopt a more phenomenological approach .",
    "it utilizes known masses and insight from successful past calculations instead based on ( i)-(iii ) above in order to extrapolate to the @xmath76 mass .",
    "we focus on the @xmath76 @xmath88 state ( rather then @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) @xmath91 states ) since in both the tetraquark and deuson approach it is more strongly bound .",
    "the @xmath92 hyperfine interaction , eq .",
    "( [ hf ] ) , strongly favors @xmath93 @xmath94 which is a @xmath19 of color .",
    "the resulting anti - symmetry in color and separately in spin does then require flavor antisymmetry , _",
    "i.e. _ isosinglet @xmath94 state , in order to maintain overall fermi statistics .",
    "note that the @xmath95 quarks , which are in @xmath18 of color , must then form a spin triplet .",
    "this suggests an overall @xmath96-wave @xmath52 singlet @xmath76 state whose lightest putative decay channel is indeed @xmath97 .",
    "also in the deuson approach the attractive opep is three times as strong in the @xmath88 than in the @xmath91 channel .",
    "we thus consider the following putative double difference relation , @xmath98 it assumes that the extra energy required for replacing a @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 ) quark by a @xmath101 ( @xmath94 ) diquark in the presence of a @xmath102 quark or @xmath103 diquark is the same .",
    "it is clearly true in the heavy quark limit . indeed in this limit",
    "the compact tightly bound @xmath104 pair is like a heavier antiquark flavor .",
    "equation  ( [ main ] ) would then be analogous to the relation inspired by the heavy quark symmetry : @xmath105 which holds very well .    to further motivate eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) we note that quark masses and almost all pairwise interactions cancel out via the double difference .",
    "the interactions between the @xmath106 and @xmath107 quarks in the @xmath108 diquark in @xmath76 and in @xmath109 match as well as the interactions between the @xmath110 ( @xmath111 of spin ) in @xmath76 and the similar @xmath101 pair in @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath92 interaction between the @xmath102 quark and the @xmath113 quarks in @xmath114 cancel out since @xmath115 implies @xmath116 where we utilized the color neutrality condition , @xmath117 , for @xmath118 .",
    "similarly the @xmath92 interactions between the charmed quarks and the @xmath119 quarks in @xmath23 cancel .",
    "apart from an overall common factor @xmath120 we have , using again @xmath121 , @xmath122 the last expression is an operator @xmath123 anti - symmetric under the exchange of the color degrees of freedom of @xmath100 and @xmath124 . in the tetraquark state",
    "the @xmath100 and @xmath124 colors are also coupled antisymmetrically in forming the @xmath125 ( anti)diquark . as a result",
    "the total @xmath92 interaction energy between the light and the heavy quarks in the tetraquark has the form @xmath126 which vanishes since upon an exchange of color indices of @xmath100 and @xmath124 this matrix element changes sign .    to complete motivating eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) we still need to show that the @xmath127 ( and @xmath128 ) @xmath92 interactions in @xmath129 and in @xmath130 match .",
    "the latter is : @xmath131 where we used @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath92 interactions in the doubly charmed baryon are however : @xmath134 the second term above vanishes since , again , @xmath135 so that we obtain : @xmath136 where in the last step we used @xmath137 ( since the lightest charmed baryon has spin 1/2 ) and @xmath138 ( since the two charmed quarks are in @xmath139 state ) .    we find that the hyperfine ( attractive ) interaction in @xmath129 and in @xmath140 do not exactly match but are slightly stronger in @xmath141 by @xmath142 thus by subtracting the physical _ lighter _ d mass we are actually causing an imbalance in eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) and an _ overestimate _ of @xmath143 .",
    "a corrected equation should therefore read : @xmath144 while the masses of @xmath118 , @xmath141 and @xmath145 are well known , this is definitely not the case for the doubly charmed baryons .",
    "the lowest selex peak appears in @xmath146 at @xmath147 @xcite . using this value in eq .",
    "( [ mt ] ) yields @xmath148 which is about @xmath149 _ below _ the @xmath78 threshold .",
    "unfortunately the lowest peak in @xmath150 is at @xmath151 and not degenerate with the @xmath152 peak as it should be by isospin invariance .",
    "we therefore choose the @xmath150 peak ( which indeed coincides with a ( relatively small ) enhancement in the @xmath150 selex data ) as representing the true value of the lowest charmed baryon .",
    "this is clearly a more conservative choice as both selex peaks are lower than most previous theoretical predictions . using this we obtain , @xmath153 some @xmath154 _ above _ the @xmath78 threshold .",
    "various explicit and implicit assumptions were made in order to obtain eq .",
    "( [ mt ] ) making for a theoretical uncertainty in the predicted value of @xmath143 beyond the @xmath155 experimental uncertainty discussed above .",
    "\\a ) we used a common overlap probability `` @xmath156 '' for all @xmath157 or @xmath158 pairs which corresponds to a `` universal bag radius '' . in reality",
    "the latter could change as we go from two to three to four quark systems .",
    "the successful phenomenology of baryon / meson hyperfine splitting suggests that this may be a weak effect .",
    "furthermore a systematic change will largely cancel in the double difference relation in eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .",
    "\\b ) we have restricted our discussion to diquarks coupled to @xmath159 ( or @xmath19 ) of color only .",
    "however in the tetraquark system we encounter ( for the first time ) the possibility of coupling @xmath160 ( and @xmath94 ) to @xmath37 ( @xmath161 ) of color  a coupling , which is clearly not allowed in a baryon .",
    "the restriction to the @xmath162 pattern may be well justified by the fact that it has a lower energy than the @xmath163 .",
    "nonetheless these channels can in principle mix , and allowing for such admixture to optimize the binding will lower the mass of the physical state .",
    "\\c ) the admixture of the `` one bag '' tetraquark state above and the `` two bag '' deuson state ( which again occurs first in four - quark exotic states ) will also , by the above mentioned variational argument , tend to lower the energy .",
    "all the above suggests that if the selex peak at @xmath164 is indeed the lightest double charmed baryon , we have a @xmath23 state slightly below or slightly above threshold . specifically , if @xmath165 we expect @xmath166",
    "we would next like to argue that if @xmath23 has the above mass it may well be the first narrow exotic hadron to be discovered .",
    "the potential discovery depends jointly on + ( i ) the rate of @xmath76 production @xcite , and + ( ii ) the existence of decay modes which can provide a unique signature .",
    "the production rates ( at hadronic or @xmath167 colliders ) of the state @xmath76 of interest are very small as all the following conditions should be met : + ( a ) two pairs of charmed quarks @xmath168 and @xmath169 need to be produced .",
    "+ ( b ) these pairs should be close spatially .",
    "also @xmath106 from the first pair , and @xmath107 from the second should have small relative momenta in order for a a @xmath95 diquark to form .",
    "+ ( d ) finally the @xmath95 diquark should pick up a @xmath94 ( anti)diquark to form @xmath76 .    the first two factors ( a ) and ( b ) also suppress the production rate of doubly charmed baryons @xmath109/@xmath170 .",
    "the only further suppression of the @xmath76 production rate is due to the need to pick up a @xmath94 diquark instead of merely just one @xmath99 ( or @xmath171 ) in the case of @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests the following `` double ratio '' relation : @xmath172 which is analogous to the double difference relation in eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .",
    "is suppressed by a boltzmann factor proportional to @xmath173 .",
    "equation  ( [ rr ] ) results then as the exponential of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) . ]",
    "the ratio of the charmed baryon , @xmath118 , production and that of @xmath21 s is roughly the same as in the case of strange baryons / mesons : @xmath174 hence we expect from eq .",
    "( [ rr ] ) @xmath175 namely that the @xmath23 production rate is about @xmath176 that of charmed baryons .",
    "if @xmath23 is to be discovered this tiny production rate needs to be compensated by striking decay signatures .",
    "the decay modes critically depend on @xmath143 or @xmath177 , the separation between @xmath143 and the @xmath178 threshold , defined in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) .",
    "we will next discuss the different @xmath143 ranges starting with the most strongly bound case .",
    "\\(a ) @xmath179 or @xmath180 .",
    "+ in this case  which the above discussion suggests to be unlikely  we can only have two consecutive weak decays . strictly speaking",
    "only the second vertex involves an on - shell reconstructible @xmath181 or @xmath141 .",
    "however , up to small binding effects , @xmath182 , the tracks emerging from the first decay may well correspond to another @xmath21 .",
    "there is some probability that the charm quark surviving after the first decay may be inside a @xmath22 so that an extra , slow pion emitted from the first decay vertex can combine with the @xmath183-momenta of the second vertex particles to form a @xmath22 .",
    "finally all particles from the two decay vertices should reconstruct a narrow @xmath23 state below @xmath184 .",
    "\\(b ) @xmath185 or @xmath186 + in this case we will have an electromagnetic decay : @xmath187 with two weak decay vertices due to @xmath181 and @xmath141 decays . while the state will be narrow ,",
    "reconstructing the invariant mass , @xmath188 , and looking for a sharp peak requires identifying a relatively soft photon ( @xmath189 in the @xmath23 rest frame ) emerging from the primary decay vertex .",
    "\\(c ) @xmath190 or @xmath191 + here we clearly have @xmath192 ( or @xmath193 ) .",
    "the @xmath194 will decay into @xmath195 at the primary vertex and the two @xmath21 s will next decay weakly at separate vertices .",
    "thus we attempt to reconstruct the two @xmath21 s and the @xmath22 and finally look for an overall peak in the @xmath78 invariant mass distribution",
    ". this last constraint may not be very helpful ( and the @xmath23 can be altogether missed ) if its width @xmath196 ( substantially ) exceeds the experimental resolution which we optimistically take to be @xmath197 .    since @xmath198 is an @xmath199-wave decay and no new quark pairs need to be created ( as in @xmath200",
    ", for instance ) one might expect a large decay width , @xmath201 , as is the case with @xmath202 exotics made of light quarks .",
    "two factors may , however , reduce @xmath203 .",
    "first we have a two - body decay phase space which is proportional to @xmath204 or @xmath205 , the velocity of @xmath21 or @xmath22 in the @xmath23 s rest frame , which unlike in the decays of light exotics may be significantly less than one : @xmath206    second , it may well be that the physical @xmath52 hadron of interest has a relatively small deuson component , @xmath207 : @xmath208 with @xmath23 being the `` one bag '' genuine four quark state .",
    "since only the deuson component readily falls apart into @xmath209 we may then have a further suppression by a factor of @xmath207 . if @xmath210 the joint @xmath211 effect reduces the decay rate from @xmath201 to @xmath212 .",
    "note , since the state of interest is an @xmath199-wave of the @xmath213 we may lack any repulsive interaction  akin to coulomb repulsion in fission or @xmath214 decays  to generate a resonance in the first place @xcite .",
    "rather we may have , as in the @xmath91 @xmath199-wave nucleon - nucleon scattering , a `` virtual bound state '' .",
    "the experimental manifestation of the latter  a strong enhancement at the @xmath97 threshold , may be still sufficiently striking .",
    "the above lifetime estimates would then still pertain to the width of this enhancement .    in principle we can also have @xmath215 tetraquark ( and/or meson - antimeson , @xmath216 , @xmath217 deusons ) with `` hidden '' charm .",
    "such combinations will be much more easier to produce as only one @xmath218 pair needs to be created .",
    "naively one would expect such states to decay very quickly into @xmath219 .",
    "t@xmath54rnqvist , whose main concern was actually meson - antimeson binding did , however , suggest that a primary extended deuson @xmath220 state would have little overlap with the @xmath221 ( compact @xmath222 ) state .",
    "this would then make for a relatively narrow @xmath220 state which still could be nicely identified via its unique ( @xmath223 ) decay mode at a specific @xmath219 invariant mass .",
    "the @xmath224 double charmed baryons have presumably been seen at fnal @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 is most likely produced there with high lab momenta .",
    "the proximity of the @xmath23 mass to the @xmath78 threshold cause the two subsequent weak decay vertices to be very precisely aligned with the initial interaction vertex  a feature which will be most helpful in a tetraquark hunt .",
    "the much lower energy @xmath167 colliders can also serve as promising search grounds with a much cleaner environment . thus at @xmath225 ( @xmath226 ) the primary virtual photon interaction yields in about @xmath227 of all cases a @xmath222 pair .",
    "this then will vastly increase the number of events in which we have two charmed quark pairs to be @xmath228 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath229 events @xcite .",
    "the events in which @xmath230 will not form will have typical @xmath231 final states ( @xmath232 indicates @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) with a few extra particles due to the limited phase space ( @xmath233 ! ) .",
    "the systematic search of peaks in @xmath234 or @xmath235 invariant mass distribution could thus be feasible despite the large combinatorial background .",
    "peaks in @xmath236 mass distribution could also occur .",
    "these should manifest in the much cleaner ( @xmath237 ) channel .",
    "hopefully by @xmath22 ( or @xmath238 ) cascade decays and by @xmath239 , @xmath240 separation one will be able to distinguish @xmath241 from @xmath242 pairs .    finally we note that the brown - hanbury - twiss effect favoring @xmath243 ( and @xmath244 ) pairs with small relative momenta should not be operative here as the two pseudoscalar @xmath21 s do not emerge from the same vertex ( even the @xmath21 s from the @xmath245 decay would emerge several hundred fermies away from the primary vertex because of the narrow @xmath22 s width ) .",
    "we have presented various estimates pertaining to a possible tetraquark @xmath246 state .",
    "if the selex second peak corresponds to the lightest doubly charmed baryon , then our estimates of the mass of @xmath246 are close to the @xmath97 threshold .",
