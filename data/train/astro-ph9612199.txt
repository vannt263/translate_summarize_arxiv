    "understanding of the observed alignment of interstellar grains is a challenging problem of nearly a half century s standing ( see roberge 1996 ) . lacking a proper understanding of the alignment processes",
    ", we can only tentatively interpret polarimetric data in terms of the magnetic field . indeed",
    ", polarizing grains can be aligned with long axes either perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field , depending on what causes the alignment ( see lazarian 1994 ) ; they can also be not aligned at all ( see goodman 1996 ) .",
    "one of the essential features of grain dynamics in the diffuse interstellar medium ( henceforth ism ) is suprathermal rotation ( purcell 1975 , 1979 ) .",
    "originally , three separate causes of suprathermal rotation were suggested : inelastic scattering of impinging atoms when the gas and grain temperature differ , photoelectric emission , and h@xmath0 formation on grain surfaces .",
    "the latter was shown to dominate the other two for typical conditions in the diffuse ism ( purcell 1979 ) .",
    "more recently , radiative torques due to starlight have been identified as a major mechanism driving suprathermal rotation ( draine & weingartner 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "alignment of grains rotating suprathermally differs considerably from the alignment of thermally rotating grains .",
    "the theory of paramagnetic alignment of suprathermal grains was discussed by purcell ( 1979 ) and spitzer & mcglynn ( 1979 ) ; henceforth sm ) , and has been elaborated by lazarian ( 1995b , c , 1996b ) . until recently , mechanical alignment , e.g. alignment caused by a gaseous flow ,",
    "was thought not to be applicable to suprathermally rotating grains , as rapid rotation makes the grains not susceptible to such a process .",
    "however , two new mechanisms of mechanical alignment of suprathermally rotating grains , namely , the `` crossover '' and `` cross - section '' mechanisms , have been suggested recently ( lazarian 1995d ) and shown to be effective in interstellar regions with gas - grain streaming ( lazarian & efroimsky 1996 ; lazarian et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the crossover event is the most important period in the dynamics of suprathermally rotating grains .",
    "the h@xmath0 formation sites on a grain surface have a finite `` lifetime '' @xmath5 , which may be determined by the `` resurfacing '' of the grain by accreted atoms ( sm , purcell 1979 ) or poisoning of active sites by oxygen ( lazarian 1995c ) .",
    "because of the changes in the resulting torque , the spin - up has a finite duration and this limits the paramagnetic alignment attainable . in the case of mechanical alignment , it is during the crossovers that the grain is susceptible to alignment due to gaseous bombardment .",
    "the pioneering study of sm showed that the direction of angular momentum before and after crossover are correlated .",
    "however , sm found that the correlation was insufficient for the paramagnetic mechanism to achieve significant alignment within the model they adopted .",
    "recent progress in the understanding of certain subtle issues of grain dynamics has led us to reexamine the crossover process .",
    "sm assumed that during suprathermal rotation the grain angular momentum is perfectly aligned with the axis of major inertia .",
    "this coupling arises from internal dissipation which , as known from theoretical mechanics , causes a spinning solid body to rotate about its axis of major inertia , this being the state of minimum rotational kinetic energy for fixed angular momentum .",
    "the assumption of perfect relaxation seems natural , as the time - scale for internal relaxation for suprathermally rotating grains is many orders of magnitude less than the time - scale of the spin - up , but it is not exact : it disregards thermal fluctuations within the grain body .",
    "in fact , it was shown in lazarian ( 1994 ) that due to thermal fluctuations , the coupling above is never perfect ( the formal theory of this phenomenon is elaborated in lazarian & roberge 1996 ) .",
    "the component of angular momentum perpendicular to the axis of the major inertia , although tiny compared to the grain angular momentum during suprathermal rotation , is very important in the course of a crossover .",
    "we therefore reconsider the sm theory of crossovers in order to allow for the effects of thermal fluctuations .",
    "in  2 we pose the problem and present the necessary facts concerning incomplete internal relaxation . in ",
    "3 we derive the disorientation factor accounting both for thermal fluctuations within the grain material and for the effects of gaseous bombardment . the latter effect is of secondary importance in diffuse clouds but may be important in molecular clouds .",
    "the consequences of the incomplete disorientation on paramagnetic and mechanical alignment are discussed in  4 and the conclusions are presented in  5 .",
    "a crossover is the event that occurs between two sequential spin - ups when the component of @xmath6 parallel to the axis of major inertia passes through zero .",
    "this is a critical period for grain dynamics , and during the crossover the grain is susceptible to disorientation , which will limit the effectiveness of paramagnetic alignment .",
    "if the grain is situated in a region with substantial gas - grain streaming , the grain is susceptible to mechanical alignment during crossovers .",
    "our task in the present paper is to describe the evolution of grains through crossover events , accounting for the effects of thermal fluctuations within the grain material .    to understand the crossover one needs to recall certain basic features of suprathermal rotation . here",
    "we assume that grains are spun - up by torques arising from h@xmath0 formation , and consider a `` brick '' with dimensions @xmath7 and density @xmath8 .",
    "the ratio @xmath9 determines the degree of grain oblateness ; @xmath10 for the grain @xmath11 discussed in purcell ( 1979 ) .",
    "it is possible to show ( sm ; draine & lazarian 1996 ) that the components of the torque perpendicular to the axis of major inertia average out and therefore only the component of the torque parallel to this axis matters .",
    "we direct the @xmath12-axis along the axis of major inertia .",
    "we let n_hn(h)+2n(h_2 )  , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the concentrations of atomic and molecular hydrogen , respectively ; the h@xmath0 fraction we denote @xmath15 .",
    "the number of h@xmath16 molecules ejected per second from an individual site is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fraction of h atoms ( with mean speed @xmath19 and mass @xmath20 ) adsorbed by the grain , and @xmath21 is the number of active sites over the grain surface .",
    "the mean square torque from h@xmath16 formation is ( see appendix a ) l_z^2 ^ 2a^6(1-y)^2 n_^2m_v_^2e^-1r^4(r+1 )  , [ 3 ] where @xmath22  ev is the kinetic energy of a nascent h@xmath0 molecule . the fluctuating torque @xmath23 spins up grains to an rms angular velocity ^2 ^ 1/2 = l_z^2 ^ 1/2 ( ) ^1/2  , [ 4 ] ( purcell 1979 ) , where @xmath24 is the @xmath12 component of the momentum of inertia , @xmath25 is the rotational damping time ( see appendix a ) t_d=  , [ 5 ] and @xmath5 is the lifetime of an active site .    to obtain both characteristic numerical values and functional dependencies",
    "we will use quantities normalized by their standard values ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we denote the normalized values by symbols with hats , e.g. @xmath26 , with @xmath27 as the standard value of grain size .",
    "we consider ` standard ' an h@xmath0 formation efficiency @xmath28 and @xmath29  cm  s@xmath30 . for diffuse clouds we assume that all hydrogen there is in atomic form and therefore @xmath31 .",
    "note that sometimes the choice of ` standard ' values is somewhat arbitrary , e.g. for the time being we assume the density of active sites of active sites . ] @xmath32 to be @xmath33  @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 .    using standard values of the parameters we obtain the following expression for the angular velocity @xmath36 the lifetime of an active site of h@xmath0 formation",
    "is limited by both accretion of a mono - layer of refractory material ( sm ) and poisoning by atomic oxygen ( lazarian 1995c ) .",
    "the former is usually slower than the latter and could provide long - lived spin up with @xmath37 .",
    "further on we use the term `` resurfacing '' to refer to the fastest mechanism of the two .",
    "the component of the mean torque along the axis of major inertia before and after , say , resurfacing may be directed either in the same direction as before the process , or in the opposite direction . in the latter case",
    "the grain undergoes a spin - down .",
    "the mean interval between crossovers is ( purcell 1979 ) |t_z(t_l t_d)^1/2  .",
    "[ pur ] the active site lifetime @xmath5 is very uncertain . in our numerical examples in this paper",
    "we will take @xmath38 s. for our standard parameters ( table  2 ) in a diffuse hi cloud this corresponds to @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "when a grain rotates about an arbitrary axis , the angular velocity precesses in grain body coordinates .",
    "the barnett effect produces a magnetic moment parallel to the angular velocity .",
    "purcell was the first to realize that this should result in internal dissipation with a dissipation time - scale inversely proportional to the angular velocity squared ( purcell 1979 ) .",
    "it is possible to show ( see  3.2 ) that this effect suppresses rotation around any axis but the axis of major inertia on a time - scale @xmath41  s , where @xmath42 is the ratio of grain rotational energy to the equipartition energy @xmath43 .",
    "both h@xmath0 formation ( purcell 1979 ) and radiative torques ( draine & weingartner 1996a ) can produce @xmath44 and therefore grains tend to rotate around their axes of major inertia .",
    "although the ratio @xmath45 can be as small as @xmath3 ( see table  2 ) the alignment of @xmath6 with the axis of major inertia ( @xmath2 ) is not perfect .",
    "the deviations of @xmath2 from @xmath6 arise from thermal fluctuations within the grain material ( lazarian 1994 , lazarian & roberge 1996 ) . to estimate the value of such deviations recall that rotation about @xmath2 corresponds to the minimum of the grain kinetic energy for",
    "fixed @xmath46 ( internal dissipation does not alter @xmath46 ) does change due to h@xmath0 torques one should substitute its value averaged over the time of internal relaxation in eq.([ek1 ] ) . ] .",
    "for a symmetric oblate grain with @xmath47 ( i.e. , our `` brick '' with @xmath48 ) , the grain kinetic energy is e_k()=(1+^2 ( -1 ) )  , [ ek1 ] where @xmath49 is the angle between @xmath6 and @xmath2 . in thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "the fluctuations of the kinetic energy should have a boltzmann distribution : f()d = const(-)d  , [ r1 ] where @xmath50 is the dust temperature .",
    "it follows from ( [ r1 ] ) that the fluctuating component of angular momentum perpendicular to the axis of the major inertia @xmath51 can be approximated j_0 ^ 2 ( )  .",

    "@xmath52 is the characteristic value for the minimum value of the grain angular velocity during a crossover .",
    "when the rotation is suprathermal , @xmath53 is negligible compared to @xmath46 and angle @xmath49 is very close to zero .",
    "however , as the component of angular momentum @xmath54 parallel to the axis of major inertia decreases during crossovers , the angle @xmath55 increases .",
    "when the angular velocity decreases sufficiently , internal relaxation becomes less efficient and the value of @xmath56 rises as a result of the stochastic character of h@xmath0 formation and impacting gas atoms . at some point the component of @xmath6 parallel to @xmath57 passes through zero and the grain flips over ( sm ) .",
    "our task is to calculate the correlation of the grain angular momentum before and after the crossover .",
    "this is done in the next section .",
    "in our treatment below we repeat the reasoning introduced in sm but with allowance for thermal fluctuations . the zeroth approximation , following sm ,",
    "is the dynamics of a grain subjected to regular torques only .",
    "the dynamical effects of the stochastic torques can be evaluated by an approximate theory based on small perturbations of the zeroth - order solution .",

    "scales long compared to @xmath69 the rotation of the grain around @xmath70 and the precession of @xmath70 around @xmath65 imply that the only torque component which does not average to zero is that due to @xmath23 , the component of @xmath67 along the @xmath57-axis .",
    "after this averaging we obtain @xmath71 from the euler equations ( see sm ) we find the components of @xmath70 in body coordinates @xmath72 where @xmath73 at the moment of crossover .",

    "the stochastic torques make the story more involved .      our considerations above ignored the fluctuations associated with the barnett effect .",

    "consequently , the actual time spent during the crossover will be increased .",
    "quantitative analysis of this regime is beyond the scope of the present paper ; it does appear clear , however , that each crossover will be accompanied by substantial disalignment when @xmath82 .    in our present study",

    "although we do not quantitatively discuss here the alignment of grains with @xmath225  cm we conjecture that the alignment of such grains may be suppressed by the effective disalignment during each crossover ( i.e. @xmath226 ) , due to the variations in the angle @xmath49 due to barnett fluctuations when @xmath82 ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath227 on @xmath92 ( see eq.([tbtc ] ) ) suggests that this may account for the observed lack of alignment of interstellar grains with @xmath228 ( kim & martin 1995 ) .",
    "we see , then , that if the only important torques were those due to h@xmath0 formation , gas - grain collisions , and paramagnetic dissipation , we would expect paramagnetic grains in diffuse clouds to be substantially aligned for @xmath229 cm , and probably minimally aligned for @xmath89 , at least qualitatively consistent with observations .",
    "it has recently been recognized , however , that starlight plays a major role in the dynamics of @xmath230 @xmath231 m grains : the torques exerted by anisotropic starlight ( @xmath210 ) drive suprathermal rotation ( draine & weingartner 1996 ) and ( @xmath232 ) can directly act to align @xmath6 with the interstellar magnetic field ( draine & weingartner 1997 ) .",
    "since we have neglected starlight torques in the present paper , our conclusion for @xmath230 @xmath231 m grains is only preliminary .",
    "a study of crossovers incorporating the effects of both h@xmath0 formation and anisotropic starlight is planned .",
    "it appears to us highly likely that when both effects are included , the observed lack of alignment of @xmath233 @xmath231 m grains , and substantial alignment for @xmath230 @xmath231 m grains , will be explained .",
    "we recall that suprathermal rotation can also be driven by variations of the accommodation coefficient and photoelectric emissivity ( purcell 1979 ) . in a molecular ( @xmath234 ) region with no ultraviolet light , purcell s estimate for the torque due to variations in accommodation coefficient leads to @xmath235 cm as the radius for which @xmath236 .",
    "however , for this case we also find @xmath237 for @xmath238 , so that purcell alignment will be insufficient unless @xmath239 .",
    "it was previously thought that suprathermally rotating grains are not subject to mechanical alignment when the gas is streaming relative to the grain .",
    "however , two mechanisms of mechanical alignment of suprathermally rotating grains , namely , `` cross - section '' and `` crossover '' alignment , were proposed by lazarian ( 1995d ) .",
    "the first process is caused by the fact that the frequency of crossover events depends on the value of the cross - section exposed to the gaseous flux ( see lazarian & efroimsky 1996 for more details ) .",
    "the second mechanism arises from the substantial susceptibility of grains to alignment by gas - grain streaming during crossover events .",
    "both mechanical processes are related to the phenomenon of crossovers .",
    "thus our finding of reduced disorientation during crossovers is a new feature that should be incorporated into the discussion of mechanical alignment . as we mentioned earlier , this reduced randomization is valid only for grains with @xmath88 , where @xmath86 is given by eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) , and therefore no changes of the earlier results are expected for grains with @xmath240  cm . such grains can be aligned , for instance , by ambipolar diffusion , which favors small grains .    to start with ,",
    "consider the cross - section mechanism .",
    "in lazarian ( 1995d ) this mechanism was exemplified using a toy model , namely , a flat disc grain which randomly jumps in the course of a crossover from one position , where the surface of the disc is parallel to the flow , to the other position , where the disc surface is perpendicular to the flow .",
    "if the probability per unit time of a crossover is proportional to the rate at which atoms arrive at the grain surface , it is easy to see that the grain will spend more time at orientations where the cross section presented to the streaming gas is minimal . within the toy model above , this corresponds to the position with the surface of the disc parallel to the flow .    in other words",
    ", the cross - section mechanism uses the fact that @xmath185 is a function of the angle @xmath241 between the grain axis of major inertia and the direction of the gaseous flow . roughly speaking",
    ", our study above shows that crossovers with disorientation parameter @xmath222 and mean time between crossovers @xmath185 are equivalent to crossovers with complete disorientation and the mean time between crossovers @xmath242 .",
    "if @xmath124 is dominated by thermal fluctuations its dependence on gaseous bombardment vanishes ( see eq .",
    "( [ a101 ] ) ) as does its dependence on @xmath241 .",
    "thus the only effect of incomplete disorientation during crossovers ( as compared to full disorientation ) is to increase of alignment time ( the time to attain a steady - state ) by a factor @xmath243 .",
    "`` crossover alignment '' depends on the ratio of the randomizing torques arising from h@xmath0 formation and aligning torques caused by gaseous bombardment ( see lazarian 1995d ) .",
    "this ratio neither depends on the number of crossovers nor on the time of alignment .",
    "the fact that the thermal fluctuations do not change the direction of @xmath6 is essential for understanding why this type of alignment is not suppressed in the presence of the incomplete disorientation during crossovers .",
    "it is possible to show , however , that the time of alignment increases by a factor @xmath243 .    in spite of the fact that the measure of the mechanical alignment does not change , our observation that the time required to reach steady state is increased by a factor @xmath243 can be important",
    "this is particularly important whenever grain alignment is caused by a transient phenomenon , e.g. , a mhd shock .",
    "if @xmath242 is much longer than the time of streaming , the alignment of grains with @xmath244 cm will be marginal .",
    "we have shown that thermal fluctuations within the grain material limit the extent to which the axis @xmath2 of major inertia can be aligned with the angular momentum @xmath6 in suprathermally rotating grains .",
    "although the fluctuating angle @xmath49 between @xmath2 and @xmath6 is tiny when the grain is rotating suprathermally , it becomes larger and of critical importance during periods of crossovers .",
    "we have proved that for grains with @xmath229 cm the non - zero component of @xmath2 perpendicular to @xmath6 arising from thermal fluctuations substantially _ diminishes _ the degree of the randomization of the angular momentum direction in the course of crossovers . if the only torques acting on a grain are those due to gas - grain collisions , h@xmath0 formation , and paramagnetic dissipation , our estimates show that for large ( @xmath245 ) grains the grain alignment is close to perfect , while small ( @xmath89 ) would have only marginal alignment .",
    "if there is gas - grain streaming , the thermal fluctuations increase the time for mechanical alignment for large suprathermally rotating grains , but do not alter the limiting steady state measure of alignment .",
    "if the mechanical alignment is caused by alfvenic waves , it acts in unison with the paramagnetic mechanism to enhance the alignment of large grains . for small grains mechanical alignment due to transient phenomena ( e.g. ambipolar diffusion within mhd shocks )",
    "can be the dominant cause of alignment .",
