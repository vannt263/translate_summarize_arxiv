    "is detected near one or a few internuclear separations ( condon points ) , at which the energy difference between upper and lower potential curves match the laser energy .",
    "as the wp swings back and forth inside the potential well , excitation to the ionic state becomes maximum each time the wp passes a condon point .",

    "the source chamber is pumped by three turbo pumps ( 1000l / s each ) backed by a roots and rotary vane pump .",
    "the beam enters the oven chamber through a commercial skimmer with a diameter of 0.4 mm to pick up two rb atoms out of atomic rb vapor inside a pickup cell .",
    "the number of collisions of the droplets with free dopant atoms inside the vapor cell is controlled by the oven temperature . given the flight distance of the droplets of 1 cm inside the vapor cell the rb reservoir is heated to a temperature @xmath50380k to achieve highest probability for pick - up of two dopant atoms per droplet .",
    "due to their high mobility on the superfluid he droplets the picked - up atoms bind together to form dimers which are weakly bound in dimples on the droplet surface .",
    "collisional as well as binding energy is dissipated by the he droplet through evaporation of he atoms , which may also cause the desorption of the alkali dimers from the droplets .",

    "this leads to an enrichment of the droplet beam with high - spin dimers and clusters compared to covalently bound systems @xcite .",
    "the alkali - he droplet complex eventually equilibrates at the terminal temperature of pure he droplets of 380mk .",
    "thus , only the lowest vibrational state , @xmath52 , and a few rotational states ( @xmath53 ) are populated which provides well - defined starting conditions for pump - probe experiments .    in the third vacuum chamber",

    "interestingly , the d1-transition ( 5p@xmath675s@xmath63 ) is not observed as increased pi signal , presumably due to missing further resonance conditions for the transition up into the ionic state .    for pi of rb attached to the surface of he nanodroplets , however , the situation is different . here , a broad feature red - shifted to the d1-line",
    "is measured and the peak close to the 5d@xmath625p@xmath63-transition is also enhanced . the difference between gas - phase and he droplet",

    "besides , in this spectral range the rb@xmath0-he droplet spectrum partly coincides with the system @xmath74 measured in the gas - phase . therefore we conclude that presumably both the singlet transition @xmath74 of rb@xmath0 as well as fragmentation of rb@xmath61 contribute to the pi spectrum measured at the mass of rb@xmath0 .",

    "this clearly shows that the pi spectra stem from rubidium oligomers attached to he nanodroplets .",

    "the agreement between measurement and calculation regarding peak positions and widths is quite good , in particular when considering additional broadening of the fs pi spectrum due to the spectral bandwidth of the fs - laser as well as saturation effects .",
    "however , it has to be assumed that this agreement relies on the accidental cancelation of he - matrix induced frequency shifts and the effect of near - resonant higher lying electronic states of rb@xmath0 , since the peak measured by beam depletion ( bd ) at lower laser intensity ( blue dotted line ) is blue shifted by about 100@xmath56 with respect to the pi maximum .",
    "thus , the discrepancy between the line positions in the pi and bd spectra is attributed to enhanced ionization probability due to higher lying resonances at certain laser wavelengths .",
    "the additional red squares and blue circles represent amplitudes of the fourier components , @xmath81 and @xmath84 , of the fundamental frequencies @xmath100 and @xmath117 , respectively .",

    "interestingly , the @xmath84 amplitude spectrum is shifted to smaller frequencies by about 200@xmath56 with respect to the one - pulse pi spectrum .",
    "this is an effect of the additional frequency selectivity imposed by the transition from the @xmath2-state into the ionic continuum of rb@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , when incorporating into the calculation the fcfs for the transition from the @xmath2-state to the intermediate near - resonant state @xmath15 , good agreement with the @xmath84-amplitude spectrum ( blue circles ) is achieved .",
    "the @xmath81 amplitude spectrum features two maxima in the wings of the one - pulse pi spectrum around @xmath120 nm and @xmath77 nm , and a minimum at the peak position of the pi spectrum around @xmath121 nm .",
    "again , this is attributed to the influence of various near - resonant higher - lying states on the transition to the ionic state driven by the probe pulse .",
    "this interpretation is backed by the analysis of the initial phases of the @xmath35-state oscillations obtained from band - pass filtered pump - probe transients . at @xmath120 nm ,",

    "[ fig : pispectra ] ( b ) ) .",

    "this distribution is in reasonable agreement with the left peak of the droplet spectrum of rb@xmath0 .",
    "the slight deviation of peak positions may be due to perturbations by the he matrix or due to the influence of higher lying resonances in the 3pi process .",
    "in addition , spin - orbit coupling between @xmath127 and @xmath128-states are known to induce strong perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the black dashed line is obtained by summing over franck - condon spectra assuming thermally populated @xmath129-levels at the temperature of the rb vapor cell ( 380k ) .",
    "the resulting profile matches the measured pi spectrum of effusive rb@xmath0 quite well .",
    "the peak in the bd spectrum ( blue dotted line ) is narrower but centered at the same position with respect to the pi signal .",
    "the frequency shift of about 300@xmath56 to the blue as compared to the calculated franck - condon profile is attributed to the effect of the he matrix .    besides the mentioned singlet transition",
    ", this part of the he droplet spectrum measured at the mass of rb@xmath0 may also result from fragmentation of rb@xmath130rb@xmath131rb and possibly of larger oligomers following pi , as suggested by the resemblance of rb@xmath0 and rb@xmath61 spectra ( fig .",

    "these data will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the fact that these oscillations are not observed on the rb@xmath0-mass indicates that the contribution of rb@xmath61 fragmentation to the rb@xmath0-signal is smaller than about 20@xmath132 of the signal intensity .",

    "the bd spectrum ( blue dotted line ) in this spectral range significantly differs from the pi spectrum by featuring a much narrower peak .",

    "indeed , the transition from the lowest triplet state @xmath35 to the second excited state @xmath133 is found to fall into this wavelength region .",

    "while the bd spectrum agrees quite well with the franck - condon spectrum when accounting for the laser bandwidth , both width and fine - structure of the pi spectrum are not correctly reproduced .",
    "the fact that the line intensities of the low - frequency part of the spectrum ( @xmath138@xmath56 ) varies much stronger as a function of laser intensity than the high - frequency part indicates that near - resonant transitions at higher excitations of rb@xmath0 perturb the spectrum particularly strongly in the vicinity of the @xmath139-transition .",
