    "the quasi - one - dimensional molecular compound , ( edo - ttf)@xmath0pf@xmath2 , ( refs .  )",
    "( where edo - ttf denotes ethylenedioxytetrathiafulvalene ) has been studied as one of the central topics showing a photoinduced phase transition .",
    "@xcite the 1/4-filled ( edo - ttf)@xmath0pf@xmath2 system exhibits a peierls insulating state , which is accompanied by a charge disproportionation and the bending of the edo - ttf molecules.@xcite several experiments indicate that this peierls transition comes from the cooperation effect of the molecular deformation , charge ordering , and anion ordering .",
    "the charge disproportionation along the one - dimensional chain exhibits a fourfold periodicity given by a periodic array of [ 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 ] ; i.e. , the pattern is an alternation of two charge - rich sites and two charge - poor sites .",
    "a remarkable feature of the insulating state is the large bending of the edo - ttf molecules , which does exist even for the neutral single molecule .",
    "the degree of bending depends on the valence of the edo - ttf molecule .",
    "each molecule in the high - temperature metallic phase has a valence of @xmath3 , while the valences in the insulating state are estimated as @xmath4 and @xmath5 for hole - rich and hole - poor sites , respectively .",
    "@xcite in the insulating state , the degree of bending is enhanced at the electron - rich site and is suppressed at the electron - poor site ; i.e. , the bending ( flattening ) of the molecule is observed in the electron - rich ( -poor ) site .",
    "however , the mechanism beyond the kinetic - energy gain is required in order to explain the bending and/or flattening of the molecules .",
    "recent experimental studies have focused on the phase transition induced by a weak laser pulse ; i.e. , the photoinduced phase transition , and suggest that ( edo - ttf)@xmath0pf@xmath2 exhibits a gigantic photoresponse in the low - temperature phase.@xcite in the photoinduced phase , the lattice distortion and the molecular deformation are relaxed and the system shows a metallic behavior . in addition , it has been discussed that the photoinduced phase shows an exotic behavior , and is different from that in the high - temperature metal phase .",
    "@xcite from these experiments , it has been argued that a new phase , which is not possible as a ground state and is related to a metastable state , is achieved by the photoexcitation .",
    "therefore it is of particular interest to investigate the mechanism of a metallic behavior in such a metastable state , which may be related to the electronic correlation .        a theoretical investigation on the peierls state in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quarter - filled system has been performed based on the peierls@xmath1hubbard model including the effect of the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath6 and the intersite one @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite it has been clarified that the spatial variation of the conventional charge - density wave at the quarter - filled system is of the site - centered type ; i.e. , the charge density takes a maximum at a site . on the other hand , in the peierls state of ( edo - ttf)@xmath0pf@xmath2 , it takes a maximum at the location between two neighboring sites ; i.e. , it is of the bond - centered type .",
    "it has been shown , within the mean - field theory , that the experimentally observed pattern of charge disproportionation can be reproduced by taking into account the alternation of the elastic energies.@xcite it has also been shown that , due to the effect of the elastic - energy modulation , the peierls state and the charge - ordered ( co ) state with a twofold periodicity compete with each other , and there exists the metastable state wherein the energy takes a local minimum with respect to the lattice distortion .",
    "@xcite the trigger of such a metastable state comes from the competition between the electron correlation and the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the former favors the co state with a twofold periodicity , while the latter supports the charge disproportionation with a fourfold periodicity . in the present paper ,",
    "we study both the peierls ground state and the metastable state , in terms of the phase representation based on bosonization .",
    "furthermore , we also examine the two kinds of excitations : ( i ) the excitation followed by the lattice relaxation and ( ii ) the purely electronic excitations . in ",
    "2 , our model consisting of an electron - lattice system is given and a representation based on bosonization is introduced .",
    "the peierls distortion with the bond order is taken by considering the alternation of the elastic constant for the lattice distortion . in ",
    "3 , the ground state is analyzed in terms of the phase variables of spin and charge to show the condition for the existence of the metastable state .",
    "using an extended peierls@xmath1holstein@xmath1hubbard model treated in terms of the bosonization method , we demonstrate how the first - order transition occurs where the result is qualitative the same as the previous mean - field result.@xcite in  4 , the excitations from both the peierls state and the metastable state are examined by calculating the soliton formation energy .",
    "it is shown that the latter is much smaller than that of the former .",
    "section v is devoted to the summary and discussions .",
    "as a system exhibiting the correlated peierls state , we consider a tight - binding hubbard model coupled with lattice distortion and molecular deformation , through the electron - phonon interaction . in this section , by focusing on the peierls state in ( edo - ttf)@xmath0pf@xmath2 , we first examine the characteristic features of the molecular deformation and the lattice distortion of the edo - ttf molecules , based on a quantum - chemical calculation .",
    "next , we derive the model hamiltonian of the 1d quarter - filled peierls@xmath1holstein@xmath1hubbard model , and we introduce the `` phases '' of the lattice distortion and of the molecular deformation .",
    "it has been confirmed that ( edo - ttf)@xmath0pf@xmath2 exhibits a first - order transition at around 280 k. @xcite the overlap integrals at room temperature ( rt ) and at 260 k have been estimated by an extended hckel calculation@xcite based on an x - ray structure analysis . at room temperature",
    ", there is a very weak dimerization and the overlap integral is almost uniform along the stacking direction .",
    "however , at 260 k , there is a strong variation among the overlap integrals , given by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , along the stacking direction .",
    "@xcite    in order to make the situation clearer , we estimate the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homos ) for the flat and bent molecules , and also estimate the overlap integrals , as a function of the lattice distortion and/or molecular deformation . here",
    "we simply perform the interpolation of the coordinates for the respective atoms in the edo - ttf molecules between rt and 260 k by using the relation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distortion parameter and @xmath13 . for both cases of rt and 260 k ,",

    "we found that the homo energy level for the bent edo - ttf molecule is sufficiently lowered due to the molecular deformation , and that the overlap integrals do not change their sign as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "we estimate the transfer integrals from the overlap integrals by using the empirical relation @xmath18 10 ev.@xcite at 260 k , the transfer integrals are estimated as @xmath19 mev , @xmath20 mev , and @xmath21 mev .",

    "the lattice distortion parameter @xmath24 characterizes a modulation of fourfold periodicity ; i.e. , the lattice tetramerization , and the parameter @xmath25 characterizes a modulation of twofold periodicity ; i.e. , the lattice dimerization .",
    "it can be found that the strength of the lattice tetramerization is @xmath28 mev , while that of the lattice dimerization is @xmath29 mev .",

    "the system becomes effectively half filling and each electron is localized at the location of each lattice dimer .",
    "when the @xmath35 peierls instability is taken into account , such a paramagnetic insulator changes into the non - magnetic sp state .",
    "@xcite then , one finds @xmath32 and @xmath34 in the dimer - mott + sp state .",

    "<S> we investigate the exotic peierls state in the one - dimensional organic compound ( edo - ttf)@xmath0x , wherein the peierls transition is accompanied by the bending of molecules and also by a fourfold periodic array of charge disproportionation along the one - dimensional chain . </S>",
    "<S> such a peierls state , wherein the interplay between the electron correlation and the electron - phonon interaction takes an important role , is examined based on an extended peierls@xmath1holstein@xmath1hubbard model that includes the alternation of the elastic energies for both the lattice distortion and the molecular deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the model reproduces the experimentally observed pattern of the charge disproportionation and there exists a metastable state wherein the energy takes a local minimum with respect to the lattice distortion and/or molecular deformation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we investigate the excited states for both the peierls ground state and the metastable state by considering the soliton formation of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the soliton excitation from the metastable state costs energy that is much smaller than that of the peierls state , where the former is followed only by the charge degree of freedom and the latter is followed by that of spin and charge . </S>",
    "<S> based on these results , we discuss the exotic photoinduced phase found in ( edo - ttf)@xmath0pf@xmath2 . </S>"
