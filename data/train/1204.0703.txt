    "the term _ statistical properties _ of a dynamical system @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a measurable space and @xmath2 a measurable map , refers to the behavior of large sets of trajectories of the system .",
    "it is well known that this relates to the properties of the evolution of measures by the dynamics .",
    "statistical properties are often a better object to be studied than pointwise behavior . in fact",
    ", the future behavior of initial data can be unpredictable , but statistical properties are often regular and their description simpler .",
    "suitable results can be established in many cases , to relate the evolution of measures with that of large sets of points ( ergodic theorems , large deviations , central limit , logarithm law , etc ... ) .    in this paper",
    "we take the point of view of studying the evolution of measures and its speed of convergence to equilibrium to understand the statistical properties of a class of dynamical systems .",
    "we consider fiber - contracting maps which are a skew - product whose base transformation has exponential convergence to equilibrium ( a measure of how fast iterates of the lesbegue measure converge to the physical measure ) and deduce that the whole system has exponential decay of correlations . by this",
    "it is possible to obtain other consequences regarding the statistical behavior of the dynamics , as the logarithm law , which will be introduced below .",
    "the regularity required by the techiniques we use to prove decay of correlations is quite low , so we can apply it to a class of systems including poincar return maps of lorenz like systems .",
    "we apply indeed these results to suitable poincar maps of an open dense subset of a large class of attractors of three - dimensional partially hyperbolic flows , including the _ singular - hyperbolic ( or lorenz - like ) attractors _ , introduced in @xcite .",
    "these last kind of attractors present equilibria accumulated by regular orbits , and the lorenz attractor as well the geometric lorenz attractor are the most studied examples of this class of attractors @xcite .",
    "the main feature of these systems we exploit to estimate the decay of correlations is the existence of a quite regular stable foliation .",
    "we can disintegrate a measure along the foliation , and estimate the convergence of its iterates separately , along the stable and along the unstable direction , also by the use of suitable anysotropic norms .",
    "let us mention that it was proved in @xcite that a generic @xmath3 vector field on a closed @xmath4-manifold either has infinitely many sinks or sources , or else its non - wandering set admits a finite decomposition into compact invariant sets , each one being either a uniformly hyperbolic set or a singular - hyperbolic attractor or a singular - hyperbolic repeller ( which is a singular - hyperbolic attractor for the time reversed flow ) .",
    "this shows that the class of singular - hyperbolic attractors is a good representative of the limit dynamics of many flows on three - dimensional manifolds .",
    "more important , _ the class of singular - hyperbolic attractors contains every @xmath3 robustly transitive isolated set _ for flows on compact three - manifolds ; see @xcite .",
    "we obtain exponential decay of correlations for the poincar return maps of a well - chosen finite family of cross - sections for these flows . in @xcite , exponential decay of correlations and",
    "limit laws for the two - dimensional poincar first return map of a class of geometrical lorenz attractors were proved .",
    "we now provide similar results in a much more general context .",
    "we remark that our results on decay of correlations are finer that the one of bunimovich @xcite and afraimovich , chernov , sataev @xcite , which can be seen as developments on the work of pesin  @xcite .    from the decay of correlations",
    "we then deduce a logarithm law for the hitting times to small targets in these cross - sections .",
    "then , exploiting the fact that _ the flow _ on these attractors can be seen as a suspension flow over poincar return maps , we also obtain a logarithm law for the hitting time for the singular hyperbolic flow itself .",
    "we observe that quantitative dynamical properties of this class of systems are still quite unknown .",
    "a logarithm law is a statement on the time a typical orbit hits a sequence of decreasing targets which is strictly related to the so called dynamical borel cantelli lemma and to diophantine approximation ( see @xcite and @xcite for relations with the borel cantelli lemma and other approaches ) . roughly speaking",
    ", a system has a logarithm law for a decreasing sequence of targets @xmath5 if the time which is needed for a typical orbit to hit the @xmath6-target is in some sense inversely proportional to the measure of the target .",
    "hence it is a quantitative statement indicating how fast a typical orbit `` fills '' the space .",
    "hitting time results of this kind have been proved in many continuous time dynamical systems of geometrical interest : geodesic flows , unipotent flows , homogeneous spaces etc . ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "other examples of connections with diophantine approximation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also remark that , in the symbolic setting , similar results about the hitting time are also used in information theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the logarithm law automatically holds for fastly mixing systems ( see e.g , theorem [ maine ] ) , but there are mixing systems for which the law does not hold ( @xcite ) . as it will be mentioned in the next section ,",
    "some subclass of singular hyperbolic flows has been proved to be fastly mixing but in general the speed of mixing ( and several statistical properties ) of such flows are still unknown .",
    "the referee of the current paper has pointed out to us that , in the case of poincar maps for geometric lorenz attractors , as considered in @xcite , exponential decay of correlations can be also obtained as an application of the landmark work of young  @xcite .",
    "indeed , results on the statistical behavior of more or less general classes of lorenz like flows have also been obtained by markov tower like constructions ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the approach we present here to estimate decay of correlations decouples the statistical properties of the base map of a skew - product with contracting fibers from the rest of the estimation about the speed of mixing . in the application to singular hyperbolic flows , we use the functional analytic approach to estimate the convergence to equilibrium for the base map ( a piecewise expanding map ) , but in other cases",
    "also tower like constructions could be used in this step .",
    "we also remark that we need very weak regularity assumptions on the base map apart from the speed of convergence to equilibrium ; see section  [ sec : primeiroretorno ] and remark  [ rmk : slowconverg ]",
    ". this will be essential when studying higher - dimensional partially hyperbolic systems , like the sectional - hyperbolic attractors introduced by bonatti , pumarino , viana in @xcite and metzger - morales in @xcite , where the quotient map over the contracting fibers in general fails even to have a derivative ; it should be not more than a locally holder homeomorphism .      in section [ 2p1 ]",
    "we establish results on the decay of correlations and convergence to equilibrium for fiber contracting maps with a base transformation which rapidly converges to equilibrium .",
    "those results imply the following statement ( which in turn will be applied to singular hyperbolic attractors ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the unit square , where @xmath8 $ ] . for a function @xmath9",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the best lipschitz constant of @xmath11 , that is , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the euclidean distance .",

    "we say that a @xmath2-invariant probability measure @xmath38 is _ physical _ if the _ ergodic basin _ of @xmath38 @xmath39 has positive area in @xmath40 ( two - dimensional lebesgue measure ) .",
    "we remark that items ( 4 ) to ( 6 ) of the assumptions on the above theorem can be replaced by ( much more general ) exponential convergence to equilibrium on the base map under suitable observables : see theorem [ resuno ] and theorem  [ thm : summary - exp - decay ] in section  [ 2p1 ] .",
    "we also remark that lipschitz norms can be replaced by suitable weaker anisotropic norms .",
    "next , we establish a logarithm law for the dynamics of the flow .",
    "this is a relation between hitting time to small targets and the local dimension of the invariant measure we consider .",

    "moreover @xmath1034 in item ( 2 ) above is established at item ( 6 ) of theorem [ thm : propert - singhyp - attractor ] , provided that for all equilibria @xmath464 we have the eigenvalue relation @xmath465 .",
    "let us also observe that , for the first return map @xmath1057 , associated to the singular - hyperbolic flow , the entropy is positive @xmath1058 ; see section  [ sec : positive - entropy - two ] .",
    "so , all we need to prove that @xmath1059 is exact dimensional is to verify that @xmath1060 satisfies the hypothesis of theorem [ th : steinberg ] .",

    "this all together completes what is necessary to use theorem  [ th : steinberg ] , establishing that each @xmath1065 is exact dimensional .",
    "the exact dimensionality of the measure on the section implies the exact dimensionality of the measure @xmath48 on the flow at almost each point , and the dimension satisfies @xmath1066 at almost every point @xmath44 .",
    "in this section we prove the logarithm law for singular hyperbolic flows .",
    "more precisely we prove    [ thm : exactdim - loglaw ] let @xmath1067 be a @xmath61 flow having a singular hyperbolic attractor @xmath76 satisfying the nonresonance condition in theorem  [ thm : smooth - linear ] and @xmath465 at each fixed point @xmath75 of the flow in @xmath76 .",
    "let us consider its physical invariant measure @xmath48 .",
    "let us consider @xmath42 and the local dimension at @xmath42 @xmath1068 ( which was above proved to exist almost everywhere ) , then for @xmath48 almost every @xmath44 @xmath1069 where @xmath1070 is the time needed for the orbit of @xmath44 to hit the ball @xmath41 as defined in  ( [ circlen ] ) .",
    "the remaining part of the section is devoted to the proof of the theorem [ thm : exactdim - loglaw ] .",
    "the strategy is to first establish the law for the poincar map associated to the flow , and then extend it to the flow itself .",
    "the first step is based on a result about discrete time systems which we recall : let @xmath1071 be an ergodic , measure preserving transformation on a metric space . in this setting the following is proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a generalization to targets different than balls ) .",
    "[ maine]for each @xmath42 @xmath1072 hold for @xmath1073-almost every @xmath44 .    moreover , if the system has super - polynomial decay of correlations under lipschitz observables and @xmath1074 exists , then for @xmath48-almost every @xmath44 it holds @xmath1075    [ log - sec ] we show how this result can be applied to deduce a logarithm law for the poincar map of singular hyperbolic systems as described in theorem [ thm : propert - singhyp - attractor ] , which is a suitable iteration of the first return map and then to the first return map . by proposition",
    "[ dec - lip ] and remark [ dec - sec ] , we know that the poincar map we consider has super - polynomial decay of correlations for lipshitz observables with respect to each physical invariant measure @xmath1076 .",
    "since in the previous section we proved exact dimensionality of those measures , we can apply proposition [ maine ] to our poincar map .",
    "more precisely , to apply this result to the poincar map @xmath2 and establish the logarithm law , suppose @xmath42 is in the basin of @xmath1076 and consider the system @xmath1077 .",
    "now note that since we are dealing with a ratio of logarithms , and always hold , if we establish the logarithm law for some iterate @xmath1078 , then it will hold also for @xmath1079 ; indeed , applying proposition [ maine ] , we know that there is a set @xmath137 with @xmath1080 such that @xmath1081 then we also have @xmath1082 for each @xmath1083 . but this is also true for each @xmath1084 for each @xmath6 , which by ergodicity of the first return map @xmath1079 covers a full measure set for the invariant measure @xmath1085 of the first return map @xmath1079 .",
    "finally we remark that , since each @xmath1065 is exact dimensional , and each @xmath1065 give rise to the ergodic physical measure @xmath48 of the flow by suspension , then the a.e",
    ". local dimension of each @xmath1065 will be the same for each @xmath6 .",
    "in remark [ log - sec ] we showed that , on the section , the logarithm law holds for the first return map .",
    "let us extend this to the flow .",
    "we consider a general measure preserving flow and note that , just like in discrete time systems , one inequality between hitting time behavior and dimension of the measure is valid in general ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.4 ) ) .",
    "[ easyineqflow ] let us consider a @xmath26 flow preserving the measure @xmath1086 , then for each @xmath1087 where @xmath1088 is defined @xmath1089 hold for amost each @xmath44 .",
    "the other inequality can be established by the behavior of the system on a section , as considered before .",
    "let @xmath578 be a section of a measure preserving flow @xmath1090 .",
    "we will show that , if the flow is ergodic and the return time is integrable , then the hitting time scaling behavior of the flow can be estimated by the one of the system induced on the section .    given any @xmath1091 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath611 the smallest strictly positive time such that @xmath1092 .",
    "we also consider @xmath1093 , the smallest non negative time such that @xmath1094 .",
    "we remark that these two times differ on the section @xmath578 , where @xmath1095 , while @xmath600 is the return time to the section .",
    "we define @xmath1096 as @xmath1097 , the projection on @xmath1098 . as before denote by @xmath1099 the invariant measure for the first return poincar map @xmath1079 which is induced by the invariant measure @xmath48 of the flow .",
    "[ 4log ] let us suppose that the flow @xmath1100 is ergodic and has a transverse section @xmath1098 with an induced first return map @xmath1079 and an ergodic invariant measure @xmath1101 such that @xmath1102 let @xmath1103 and @xmath1104 be balls centered in @xmath42 , with @xmath1105 .",
    "then , there is a full measure set @xmath1106 not depending on @xmath42 , such that if @xmath1107@xmath1108 ( we recall that @xmath1109 is the time needed for the flow to take @xmath44 to @xmath41 and @xmath1110 is the time needed for the induced map @xmath1079 to take @xmath42 to the same set . )    once we have the logarithm law for the first return map , by this proposition we can extend it to the flow .",
    "indeed , on the section there will be a set @xmath1111 of points where the logarithm law is satistied for each @xmath1107 .",
    "let us consider @xmath1112 .",
    "then @xmath1113 ( recall that @xmath51 is the physical measure of the flow ) because the flow is ergodic and , by definition of @xmath137 , for each @xmath1114 there is @xmath1115 such that @xmath1116 , where the constant represent the time which is needed for @xmath44 to arrive in @xmath1117 by the flow , and does not depend on @xmath43 . hence the same logarithm law which is satisfied on @xmath1111 is satisfied on @xmath137 , showing that , for @xmath44 in the full measure subset of @xmath137 @xmath1118 a similar construction can be done if the target point @xmath42 is not on the section , and extend the result to @xmath1119 .",
    "the other inequality is provided by proposition [ easyineqflow ] .",
    "all together this proves the logarithm law for the flow , once it was proved on the section .",
