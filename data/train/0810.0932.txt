    "quantum entanglement @xcite is a valuable resource in many areas of quantum optics and quantum information processing .",
    "one of the most widespread techniques for generating entangled optical states is spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) @xcite .",
    "spdc is a second - order nonlinear optical process in which a pump photon is split into a pair of new photons with conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "the phase - matching relation establishes conditions to have efficient energy conversion between the pump and the downconverted waves , called signal and idler .",
    "this condition sets also a specific relation between the frequency and the emission angle of down converted radiation .",
    "in other words , the quantum state emitted in the spdc process can not be factorized into separate frequency and wavevector components .",
    "this leads to several interesting effects where the manipulation of a spatial variable affects the shape of the polarization - temporal interference pattern .",
    "for example , the dependence of polarization - temporal interference on the selection of collected wavevectors was studied in detail in @xcite .    here",
    "we engineer the quantum state in the space of transverse momentum and we study how this spatial modulation is transferred to the polarization - spectral domain by means of quantum interferometry .",
    "we will focus on type - ii spdc using birefringent phase - matching since the correlations between wave - vectors and spectrum are stronger than employing other phase - matching conditions .",
    "our aim is twofold . from one point of view",
    ", we study the effect of spatial modulations on temporal quantum interference .",
    "this could be useful , for example , in quantum optical coherence tomography ( qoct ) @xcite .",
    "when focusing light on a sample with non - planar surface , the photons will acquire a spatial phase distribution in the far - field , which may perturb the shape of the interference dip .",
    "our results will provide a tool to understand this effect .    from a second point of view",
    ", we would like to study and characterize spatial modulation as a tool for quantum state engineering .",
    "this may find application in the field of quantum information processing , where it is important to gain a high degree of control over the production of quantum entangled states entangled in one or more degrees of freedom ( hyper - entanglement ) .",
    "we start ( section ii ) introducing a theoretical model of a type - ii quantum interferometer , comprising the polarization , spectral and spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "a modulation in the wave - vector space is provided by an adaptive optical setup and equations for the polarization - temporal interference pattern in the coincidence rate are derived . in our analysis",
    "( section iii ) we will highlight and discuss theoretically two interesting special cases .",
    "the first one is the possibility of restoring high visibility in type - ii quantum interference with large collection apertures . in some situations , to collect a higher photon flux or a broader photon bandwidth , it can be useful to enlarge the collection apertures of the optical system .",
    "but , when dealing with type - ii spdc in birefringent crystals , for large collection apertures the effect of spatial walkoff introduces distinguishability between the photons , leading to a reduced visibility of temporal and polarization quantum interference .",
    "we will show that high visibility can be restored with a linear phase shift along the vertical axis .",
    "the second effect is the spatial counterpart of spectral dispersion cancellation @xcite . in the limit of large detection apertures",
    ", the correlations between the photons momenta will cancel out the effects of even - order aberrations , exactly as in the limit of slow detectors the frequency correlations cancel out the even - order terms of spectral dispersion .",
    "the experimental demonstration of this effect has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "finally , in section iv , we introduce a numerical approach for practical evaluation of the results of the theoretical model , discussing a few examples . by means of this approximated model",
    ", we will examine under what conditions the even - order aberration cancellation effect can be observed ( section v ) .",

    "physically , this can be explained by the fact that increasing the aperture size we let more wave - vectors into the system , and so the spatial walk - off in type - ii interferometry introduces distinguishability , reducing the interference visibility . enlarging the aperture sizes is often useful in practice , for example to get a higher photon flux . moreover , since in the spdc process different frequency bands are emitted at different angles it may be necessary to open the detection aperture in applications where a broader bandwidth is needed .",

    "the modulation on the spatial degree of freedom can affect the shape of the polarization - temporal interference pattern in the coincidence rate .",
    "our aim is twofold : from one side we want to study the effect of wavefront aberration on quantum interferometry , from the other we want to discuss a way to engineer multiparametrically - entangled states .",
    "we have introduced a theoretical model to calculate the shape of the polarization - temporal interference pattern given a certain phase modulation in the crystal far - field , assuming as a free parameter the shape and the dimension of the collection apertures . using a numerical method to study",
    "the resulting equation has shown that for typical experimental cases the hypothesis of large apertures can be assumed valid .",
    "in such an approximation , only the odd part of the assigned phase modulation affects the shape of the interference pattern .",
    "this effect has recently been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .    moreover , it is often useful in experiments to enlarge the collection aperture in order to collect a higher photon flux and larger optical bandwidth .",
    "but when working with type - ii birefringently phase - matched downconversion , spatial walk - off between the emitted photons introduces distinguishability between the two possible events that can lead to coincidence detection , reducing the visibility of quantum interference .",
    "such walk - off can be compensated with a linear phase shift in the vertical direction , restoring high visibility .",
