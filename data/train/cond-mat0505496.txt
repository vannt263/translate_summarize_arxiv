    "granular materials are ubiquitous in nature and play an important role in many industrial applications , yet the appropriate coarse - grained theories for the description of these materials remain elusive due to the rich phenomenology they display in response to external perturbation  @xcite .",
    "a common example of the unusual nature of granular systems is the phenomenon of force chains , highly - stressed extended linear clusters first seen in experiments on static granular piles .",
    "these striking inhomogeneities are thought to be responsible for a host of observed nonlinear effects in static systems including interesting features in distributions of contact forces between particles  @xcite .",
    "however , the reason for the existence of the force chains has not been determined ; one possible explanation is that correlations develop while the material is flowing which then get `` frozen in '' when the system comes to rest .",
    "spatial structures have been directly observed in experiments on flowing granular materials  @xcite .",
    "more recently , measurements of velocity correlations in the surface layer of particles flowing down an inclined plane have yielded a length scale which appears to grow as the flow is arrested  @xcite . while detection of such dynamical heterogeneities in numerical studies has been more difficult , there is some evidence for their existence in simulations of gravity - driven flow through a hopper  @xcite and in images of the contact force network in simulations of chute flow  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such structures will play a crucial role in determining the dynamics of the flowing system , especially as the transition to a static system is approached .",
    "the development of spatial and temporal correlations near the transition to the static state must be investigated carefully in order to understand the nature of the transition from the flowing liquid state .",
    "dynamical heterogeneities have been observed in other systems which exhibit a similar slow dynamics as the transition from fluid to solid is approached , such as colloids near the glass transition .",
    "fast - moving particles were observed to be spatially correlated with a characteristic cluster size that increased as the glass transition was approached  @xcite . in supercooled liquids , spatial inhomogeneities can be identified via a time - dependent four - point ( two - time , two - space ) correlation function  @xcite .",
    "the interesting commonalities between these disparate systems have been explored in the context of the jamming phase diagram proposed in refs .",
    "it should be noted that in these studies the focus has been primarily on the search for a common static signature ( i.e. the distribution of contact forces @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus the proper framework to describe the dynamics of systems which have a jamming transition remains an open question .",
    "if the presence of dynamical heterogeneities governs the dynamics of these far - from - equilibrium systems near the jamming transition , then while the microscopic process by which these structures form may vary between different types of systems , some unified dynamical description may be applicable once the structures have formed .",
    "the `` soft glassy rheology '' ( sgr ) model  @xcite describes soft , nonergodic systems such as foams and dense emulsions and has successfully predicted many of the experimentally observed results .",
    "application of this type of `` trap - like dynamics '' to granular systems has also had some promising initial results  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the connections between dynamical heterogeneities and slow dynamics in a simplified model which allows us to focus on the essential effects of driving and dissipation in a flowing granular system , while still reproducing observable results from related experimental systems  @xcite .",
    "simulations have been performed of a two - dimensional gravity driven system of frictionless , bidisperse hard disks in a hopper geometry .",
    "the disks undergo instantaneous , inelastic binary collisions and propagate under gravity in between collision events . despite the simplified dynamics of the simulation ,",
    "several interesting collective effects are seen to emerge . as in previous studies  @xcite , extended linear structures defined by inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the collision frequency are visible , and their presence has a measurable effect on distributions of impulse and time intervals between collisions for a given particle . in this study",
    "we observe that the particles which make up the linear structures display a dynamic correlation between their impulse and collision time which is reflected in measurements of the collisional stress tensor ; particles identified as part of the structures appear to experience higher than average collisional stress compared with the remainder of the system . using this measure of collisional stress we can probe further into the nature of these structures and their relevance to the dynamics of the system .",
    "the grain dynamics used in the simulations are similar to ref .",
    "specifically , ( i ) at each interparticle collision , momentum is conserved but the collisions are inelastic so the relative normal velocity is reduced by the coefficient of restitution @xmath1 ; ( ii ) to allow the side walls to absorb some vertical momentum we impose the condition that collisions with the walls are inelastic with a coefficient of restitution @xmath2 in the direction tangential to the wall and ( iii ) since we wish to observe the system over many events , particles exiting the system at the bottom must be replaced at the top to create uniform , sustained flow .",
    "note that collisions are instantaneous and in between collisions the particles are driven by gravity . to avoid the phenomena of inelastic collapse the coefficients of restitution @xmath1 and @xmath2 are velocity dependent ; if the relative normal velocity between particles or between a given particle and the wall is less than some cutoff @xmath3 then the collision is presumed to be elastic  @xcite .",
    "the flow velocity is controlled by adjusting the width of the hopper opening .",
    "we also introduce a probability of reflection @xmath4 at the bottom which reduces the time needed to reach steady - state flow .",
    "typically , our simulations were done on bidisperse systems ( diameter ratio 1:1.2 ) of 1000 disks , with @xmath1 = 0.8 , @xmath2 = 0.5 , @xmath3 = @xmath5 and @xmath4 = 0.5 .",
    "the simulation was run for a total time of @xmath6 in simulation time units ( smaller particle diameter @xmath7 and gravitational constant @xmath8 are both set to 1 ) with the initial time interval of @xmath9 discarded before recording data to ensure the system has reached steady state . during the total time interval of @xmath10 over which we are evaluating the data , a given particle will pass through the hopper 5 - 10 times depending on the flow velocity .    as the width of the hopper opening is decreased the average flow velocity decreases , and at some minimum opening",
    "sustained flow is no longer observed .",
    "close to this width the mass flow exiting the hopper appears to become very intermittent , with large outflow of mass occuring on short timescales followed by long time intervals where few particles exit the system .",
    "intermittent dynamics has also been observed in simulations of flow down an inclined plane where the angle of incline is approximately equal to the angle of repose of the grains  @xcite .",
    "additionally , some preliminary measurements of spatial velocity correlations in our hopper simulations parallel to the flow direction indicate long range correlations on length scales comparable to the system size for slow flow velocities  @xcite .",
    "spatial velocity correlations with long length scales are also seen on the surface of incline plane flow  @xcite .",
    "in studies of two - dimensional freely - cooling gases @xcite some evidence of dynamical large - scale structures forming in the system was first observed by identifying all particles experiencing inelastic collapse as the assembly of grains cooled .",
    "these particles formed linear structures within dense clusters and experienced collision frequencies significantly higher than that of the other particles in the system . due to the effect of driving in our flowing system , we do not observe inelastic collapse .",
    "however , we can ask an analogous question : _ `` how many collisions does a given grain undergo in a given time interval @xmath11 ? '' _ the collision frequency for a particular particle @xmath12 in @xmath11 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of collisions experienced by particle @xmath12 in @xmath11 . we can construct images of our simulated system at regular intervals and colour individual disks according to the value of the collision frequency for that disk . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fcplot ] particles with high collision frequencies form linear chains reminiscent of the structures observed in 2d freely - cooling gases and the transient solid chains postulated by the hydrodynamic model of ref .  @xcite .",
    "these chains often appear to terminate at the boundary of the system , forming an arch - like structure in the centre of the hopper . from the pictures",
    "it is also evident that collision direction is typically oriented along the chain direction ( i.e. particles within a chain collide with other particles in the chain and not with neighbouring particles which are not part of the structure ) .",
    "thus the velocities of frequently - colliding particles are highly correlated in direction , and we can evaluate the stability of this structure with respect to perturbations arising from collisions with other ( uncorrelated ) particles . consider an initially isotropically distributed dense assembly of completely correlated disks and perturb one disk by giving it a velocity @xmath15 .",
    "the collision rule for two inelastic hard disks @xmath16 is  @xcite :    @xmath17 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\bf{v_i } \\\\ \\bf{v_j } \\end{array } \\right ]   + \\frac{1 + \\mu}{2 } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\bf{-v_i \\cdot   q } + \\bf{v_j \\cdot q } \\\\ \\bf{v_i \\cdot   q } - \\bf{v_j \\cdot q } \\end{array } \\right ] \\bf{q } \\label{collrule}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is a unit vector along the centre of mass line of the colliding disks and @xmath19 denotes the velocity of a given particle after the collision . rewriting eq .  [ collrule ] in terms of the relative velocity of particle @xmath20 to particle @xmath12 before the collision @xmath21 and after the collision @xmath22 , we can obtain an approximate expression for the time derivative of the relative velocity in the limit of @xmath23 :    @xmath24 \\bf{q } \\label{vderiv}\\ ] ]    define @xmath25 and @xmath26 as the components of @xmath18 parallel and perpendicular , respectively , to the initial perturbing velocity . from eq .",
    "[ vderiv ] it is easy to see that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "however , @xmath26 is equally likely to be positive or negative thus @xmath30 while @xmath25 is always positive and so @xmath31 . substituting this result into the above expressions for the time derivatives yields @xmath32 and @xmath33 indicating that velocity differences parallel to the initial perturbation will decay while velocity differences perpendicular @xmath15 will remain .",
    "given this , and the organizing influence of the inelastic wall collisions leading to velocities becoming normal to the wall , the appearance of collisional chains anchored to the wall becomes plausible .",
    "the unusual rheology of granular matter in response to external stress , as well as the phenomena of force chains prompts us to investigate stress in this simple model of flowing granular matter .",
    "specifically , are the frequently - colliding chains described in the previous section the dynamical analog of force chains",
    "? we can explore this possible connection by measuring the stress in our system and determining if a correspondence exists between the collisional chains and the spatial distribution of stress .",
    "additionally , we can potentially use the measured stress to calculate relevant time and length scales associated with the structures , as well as making a clearer connection between our model and other systems with soft , glassy rheology .    as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , macroscopic stress in discrete particle systems develops as a result of two microscopic mechanisms of momentum transfer : ( a ) transport of momentum due to the fluctuations of the individual particle velocities ( the kinetic stress @xmath34 ) and ( b ) transport of momentum at interparticle collisions ( the collisional stress @xmath35 ) .",
    "the total stress tensor is then the sum of the kinetic and collisional stresses .",
    "however , for the densities we observe , we find as in ref .",
    "@xcite that the magnitude of the kinetic stress contribution is several orders of magnitude lower than the collisional stress .",
    "thus we will consider only the collisional stress contribution in the analysis to follow .",
    "for a given particle @xmath12 , the @xmath36 component of the collisional part of the stress tensor at time @xmath37 is given by :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 are cartesian coordinates .",
    "the sum is taken over all collisions @xmath40 experienced by particle @xmath12 during time @xmath41 , where the interval @xmath11 is chosen such that @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the time between successive collisions for a particular particle .",
    "this constraint ensures that the particle being evaluated experiences many collisions during @xmath11 but is not significantly rearranging relative to its neighbours .",
    "there is a separation of time scales ( which will be demonstrated more concretely in the analysis to follow ) that ensures an interval @xmath11 satisfying this constraint is easy to locate . note that for hard - disk collisions @xmath44 will always be along @xmath45 , therefore the @xmath46 term in the sum is simply @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the diameters of particle @xmath12 and the other particle involved in collision @xmath40 respectively .",
    "similarly to the images of the system at a given time @xmath37 constructed for the collision frequency , we can make complementary images of @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ strplot ] ) . for every particle",
    "we calculate @xmath49 as described in eq .",
    "[ collstress ] , and extract the maximum eigenvalue @xmath50 along with the corresponding principal axis .",
    "a line along the direction of this principal axis is plotted at the particle position , and then coloured according to the value of @xmath50 relative to the average value of the maximum eigenvalue measured in that time interval @xmath51 .",
    "[ strplot ] shows some sample images constructed in this way for the same systems and times as in fig .",
    "[ fcplot ] .",
    "comparison of the two figures reveals a strong correlation between the frequently colliding particles and the highly - stressed particles . additionally , the principal axis of the stress for the highly - stressed / frequently - colliding particles is typically aligned along the chain direction .",
    "there is also a lack of a obviously growing length scale as @xmath52 , however , timescales associated with these highly - stressed structures show a significant change with flow velocity as discussed below .",
    "note that the value of @xmath50 will depend on the ratio @xmath53 , and thus , since the frequently colliding particles experience many collisions in @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath54 , where @xmath43 is the time between successive collisions for a particular particle ) , then the sum over @xmath55 can be large even if the average impulse per collision is small .",
    "thus @xmath50 ( and similarly @xmath49 ) will depend crucially on the ratio of impulse @xmath56 and collision time @xmath43 , and any correlation between these quantities .",
    "therefore , to gain a better understanding of the correspondence between the frequently - colliding particles and the highly - stressed particles we have studied the joint distribution of impulse and collision time @xmath57 .",
    "in previous work @xcite we modelled recent experiments on dense , gravity - driven monodisperse granular flows@xcite .",
    "both the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite and the simulations we performed measured the distribution of impulses transferred at each collision , @xmath58 as well as the distribution of time intervals between the instantaneous collisions @xmath59 . in the experiment",
    "the measurement was made at the wall by using a transducer positioned a short distance upstream from the hopper opening to detect the impulse transfer as a function of time to that point on the wall . in the simulation",
    "we can separately analyze data from events located within the bulk , at the walls or at a specific point on the wall to mimic the experimental measurement . for most of our discussion",
    "we will focus on observations of distributions taken from events occurring in the bulk of the material .",
    "both the experiment and the simulation revealed the same effects in the measured distributions : ( i ) an increase in the number of small impulse events as the flow velocity is decreased as well as ( ii ) an increase in the number of small collision time events as the flow velocity is decreased . in the impulse distribution in particular , this change could be directly linked to the appearance of the frequently - colliding clusters pictured above .",
    "additionally , a simple one - dimensional model was devised that demonstrated how the existence of linear clusters of particles which collide primarily along the chain direction would lead to the observed behaviour in @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the flow - rate invariant exponential form of @xmath58 at large impulse as measured in both experiment and simulation was shown to be a reflection of the local velocity distribution , which had an exponential tail ( note that the impulse distribution of uncorrelated particles is essentially the convolution of the individual velocity distributions ) . using the same 1d toy model we were able to demonstrate that the large impulse region of @xmath58 is determined primarily by the form of the velocity distribution as observed .    in the bidisperse system",
    ", the picture retains many of its original features with some added complexity . defining the scaled impulse @xmath60 where @xmath61 we can consider the behaviour of the joint distribution of impulse and collision time @xmath62 . shown in fig .",
    "[ itdist_all]a as a function of @xmath63 for two values of @xmath43 , several interesting features are seen to emerge . for both values of @xmath43",
    ", @xmath62 still shows an increase in height at impulses smaller than the average impulse as the flow velocity is decreased .",
    "however , for @xmath64 the large impulse region of the distribution is no longer flow rate independent as in the monodisperse system , and an increase in height at impulses much larger than the average is also visible  @xcite .",
    "as before , this large impulse behaviour can be linked to an accompanying shape change in the velocity distribution ( fig .",
    "[ itdist_all]b ) , and is similar to the behaviour of @xmath65 in three - dimensional md simulations of soft spheres @xcite .",
    "if we look at @xmath62 as a function of @xmath63 for a given flow velocity , it is evident that the impulse and collision time are correlated ( i.e. small impulses tend to be associated with small collision times ) . to clarify the roles played by the frequently - colliding and rarely - colliding particles in the observed shape changes in @xmath62 we can divide the joint impulse - collision time distribution into contributions from these two populations ( shown in fig .  [ itdist_fcrc ] for @xmath66 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "based on review of the images we chose a threshold frequency of @xmath67 where @xmath68 and defined all particles with collision frequency @xmath69 above this threshold as frequently - colliding .",
    "rarely - colliding particles are similarly defined as particles with @xmath70 .",
    "it appears that the correlation between impulse and collision time is stronger for the frequently colliding particles , and that these particles are the primary contributors to @xmath62 at small @xmath63 and @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "additionally , as expected from the observations made on the large impulse region of the total @xmath62 , at longer collision times and large impulses the shape of the distribution is governed by the contribution from the rarely colliding particles ( which in turn reflects the shape changes in the velocity distribution shown in fig .  [ itdist_all]b ) .",
    "the impulse / collision time correlation observed in @xmath62 is further evidence that velocities of frequently - colliding particles are correlated with small fluctuations leading to collisions with @xmath71 .",
    "note that this correlation in the velocities is apparent even in the absence of any density inhomogeneity .",
    "the connection between the frequently colliding particles and the highly - stressed particles is not surprising in the context of the impulse / collision time correlation discussed above , which would give rise to values of @xmath72 .",
    "therefore the stress heterogeneities seen in fig .",
    "[ strplot ] are directly related to the dynamic correlation reflected in @xmath62 .",
    "given that this correlation is seen to become stronger as the flow velocity decreases , it is reasonable to expect some kind of flow rate dependent behaviour in time and length scales associated with the collisional stress .",
    "as previously described , there does not appear to be any significant change in length scale of the structures with flow velocity .",
    "as a first attempt to quantify a trend in the time scale , we will calculate the autocorrelation @xmath73 of @xmath50 and determine the dependence of the time scale for the decay of @xmath73 on @xmath74 .",
    "the autocorrelation of the maximum eigenvalue @xmath75 of @xmath50 is calculated as :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the time - averaged value of the maximum eigenvalue and @xmath78 is the number of time origins @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath73 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ stracorr ] for varying flow velocities ) appears to have three decay regimes : ( i ) a short power - law regime at small time @xmath80 , ( ii ) a longer slow ( possibly logarithmic ) decay at intermediate time @xmath81 and ( iii ) a more complicated decay at long time @xmath82 which involves a shallow negative dip .",
    "this three - stage form of @xmath73 is reminiscent of density - density autocorrelations measured in supercooled liquids at low temperatures  @xcite , which show a power law regime at short time scales , a plateau at intermediate time scales and a decay to zero at much longer time scales .",
    "this implies that the intermediate slow decay observed in the granular system may be resulting from a type of `` caging effect '' introduced by the correlated motion of particles participating in one of the highly - stressed/ frequently - colliding chains .",
    "this type of @xmath73 indicates a growing separation of time scales as the flow velocity is decreased , which is an interesting similarity between granular flows and supercooled liquids .",
    "we can get a measure of the time scale associated with this intermediate slow decay of the stress by extracting the time @xmath83 at which @xmath73 has decayed to @xmath84 of its original value ( i.e @xmath85 . plotting @xmath83 vs @xmath86 ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ stracorr ] ) clearly indicates that @xmath83 diverges as @xmath86 . if we associate this time scale with the lifetime of the highly - stressed spatial structures visible in fig .",
    "[ strplot ] then one can see that as the flow velocity decreases the structures last for increasingly longer times .",
    "@xmath73 for the frequently - colliding particles only is shown in fig .",
    "[ stracorr_fc]a .",
    "these curves were calculated by choosing only those time origins @xmath79 where a given particle had been identified as frequently - colliding according to the criteria defined above ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "note the particle is not required to be frequently - colliding during the entire time interval over which @xmath73 is calculated , thus we expect the long time behaviour of these curves to be similar to that of the entire system .",
    "the same three - regime behaviour is evident , but the time scale of the decay @xmath88 is longer ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "however , the scaling of the decay time with the flow velocity is the same ( see inset to fig .  [ stracorr_fc]a ) .",
    "the role of the frequently - colliding / highly - stressed particles in determining the shape of the autocorrelation can be clarified by considering a related system ; a one - dimensional assembly of particles which experience instantaneous , binary , inelastic collisions . to establish a steady - state , a fraction of the particles are weakly driven in between collision events .",
    "this 1d system represents an idealized , isolated analog to the frequent - collision chains , and thus the stress autocorrelation measured in this system should be representative of the stress relaxation behaviour of these structures ( note that @xmath90 in the 1d system is a scalar quantity ) .",
    "@xmath73 for the 1d system is shown in fig .",
    "[ stracorr_fc]b  @xcite . from this plot",
    "it can be seen that the initial stress relaxation is slow and possibly logarithmic , similar to the slow decay regime of @xmath73 in the 2d flowing system . from this result",
    "it appears that the observed dynamical heterogeneities do dominate the stress relaxation in the flowing granular system at intermediate time scales @xmath81 .",
    "the picture which is emerging from these simulations is that large - scale highly - stressed structures analogous to force chains in static systems can form even in a simplified model of inelastic hard disks .",
    "these structures experience a slow relaxation from collisional stress at intermediate time scales in a manner analogous to temporal relaxations observed in glassy systems at low temperatures .",
    "additionally , the time scale extracted from measurements of the stress relaxation curve @xmath73 is seen to diverge as @xmath86 .",
    "this time scale can be associated with the average lifetime of a highly - stressed / frequently - colliding chain in the system and thus the chains appear to become infinitely long - lived as @xmath52 .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar search for a relevant length scale associated with these chains has been more difficult .",
    "simple two - point spatial correlations of the collisional stress have not yielded any meaningful results and thus a higher - order correlation function such as the four - point correlations measured in supercooled liquids  @xcite measured may be necessary .",
    "initial calculations of spatial velocity correlations in our flowing system have indicated the existence of a length scale which is increasing as the flow velocity is decreased  @xcite .",
    "preliminary measurements show that this length scale is of the order of the system size at the slowest flow velocities measured thus far .",
    "therefore another important consideration is finite - size effects ; while we have not explored this issue in this preliminary work , some finite - size scaling may be useful in accurately determining any measurable length scale  @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , the trap model picture may provide a framework for describing the dynamics of our simple granular flow system as well as other supercooled liquids . to explore this possibility",
    "the relevant quantity corresponding to the distribution of trapping times must be determined and measured , and the predictions of this type of coarse - grained dynamics quantitatively examined .",
