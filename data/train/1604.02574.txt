    "we see small changes by varying @xmath183 . for @xmath156",
    "the changes are moderate .",
    "they are a bit bigger for @xmath203 and even bigger for @xmath157 .",
    "but even for @xmath157 the results at threshold from @xmath204 to @xmath205 vary only by about @xmath206% .",
    "the reason for this stability is that the ratio with the new mechanisms alone is also of the type of @xmath207 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coup ] ) , so the mechanisms are practically proportional and the ratio is maintained . to observe the uncertainties in the cutoff , in fig .",
    "[ fig : delz2 ] we show the ratio from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rat5 ] ) for several @xmath116 and different values of the cutoff , @xmath150 and @xmath151 mev .",
    "@xmath183 is fixed to @xmath201 .",
    "we can see that the curves barely move as commented above .",
    "altogether , and summing different sources of uncertainties in quadratures , the conclusions that we drew before hold also now and one can obtain with this method the value of @xmath116 with uncertainties of about @xmath208 .",
    "let us note that through the derivations done we have always assumed that we have the @xmath38 state of @xmath2 in the final state . actually , the @xmath209 combination is also possible .",
    "the test conducted demands that we isolate the positive @xmath19-parity in the final state .",
    "this is in principle possible experimentally as shown in refs .",
    "certainly it would help if the process is dominated by the @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless , the study carried here is quite general and can be applied to multiple cases where one suspects that one resonance has large components of a composite system .",
    "we propose a new method to determine the amount of compositeness of resonances mostly made from two hadron components , and bound with respect to these components .",
    "the method relies on the comparison of two independent but related quantities . on the one hand ,",
    "one measures the production rate of the resonance in some reaction , independently of the decay channel of the resonance . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass distribution of the two components close to threshold is measured , which appears above the resonance energy since the resonance is supposed to be a bound state of these components .",
    "the resonance tail appears as an enhancement in the invariant mass distribution close to threshold , easily distinguishable from a pure phase space distribution .",
    "the method consists of taking the ratio of this mass distribution over the rate for the resonance production in the same reaction , also removing the phase space factors .",
    "we show that the strength is related to the coupling of the resonance to the two hadron component , and the shape to the square of the resonant amplitude .",
    "the ratio decreases as a function of the invariant mass at threshold .",
    "then , a method is used to relate the measured ratio to the compositeness of the resonance .",
    "we show that it is possible to determine the compositeness , 1-z , from that ratio .",
    "systematic uncertainties are estimated to conclude that it is possible to measure values of z with about 0.1 of uncertainty .",
    "we used a particular case for the numerical evaluations in the decay of @xmath11 which has a large composite component of @xmath2 . yet , the method is general and can be applied to any case where one has hints , or theoretical backing , for the molecular nature of a resonance . in view of this , we encourage the simultaneous measurement of these quantities , that for the moment appear in different reactions , or are measured by different groups , and usually are given in terms of counts and not absolute measurements , as is demanded by the method proposed .",
