    "the observations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies and of the large - scale structure of the universe offer a window to the physics of the inflaton .",
    "for instance the detailed measurement of the shape of the power spectrum can give constraints on the shape of the inflaton potential .",
    "on the other hand the detection of non - gaussian metric fluctuations could signal the existence of effective couplings between the inflaton and other fields .",
    "there have been a series of observational progresses in view of constraining the deviation from gaussianity using cmb data on large scales ( @xmath0 )  @xcite , intermediate ( @xmath1 )  @xcite and small scales ( @xmath2 )  @xcite , as well as large scales structures  @xcite .",
    "the recent cmb data by wmap were also used by komatsu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that concluded that the cmb spectrum was compatible with gaussianity on the basis of an analysis of the bispectrum . similar analysis using minkowski functionals  @xcite and 3-point correlation function  @xcite reached the same conclusions .",
    "more recently , an analysis of the wmap data using measurements of the genus and its statistics  @xcite conluded that the gaussianity of the cmb field was ruled out at a 99% level . as stressed after , non - gaussianity of primordial origin",
    "may still have escaped detection and further investigations are needed .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", gaussianity is a generic prediction of slow - roll single field inflation  @xcite .",
    "a series of models including feature in the inflationary potential  @xcite , existence of seeds such as @xmath3  @xcite , axion  @xcite or topological defects  @xcite , curvaton scenario  @xcite , varying inflaton decay rate  @xcite have been shown to be able to generate some primordial non - gaussianity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed a general mechanism to produce non - gaussianity in the adiabatic mode and explicit realizations of such models were presented in ref .",
    "the mechanism is based on the generation of non - gaussian isocurvature fluctuations which are then transferred to the adiabatic modes through a bend in the classical inflaton trajectory .",
    "natural realizations were shown to involve quartic self - interaction terms .",
    "the statistical properties of the resulting metric fluctuations were then shown to be the superposition of a gaussian and a non - gaussian contribution of the same variance , the relative weight of the two contributions being related to the total bending of the trajectory in field space . the non - gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf ) was also computed and shown to be described by a single new parameter so that generically only two new parameters suffice in describing this class of models .    in order to infer constraints from e.g. cmb data on these kind of models predicting non - gaussianity one needs at least to go through 2 steps .    1 .",
    "one first needs a precise prediction of the statistical properties of the curvature in order to construct estimator adapted to the detection of this kind of non - gaussianity .",
    "for instance the analysis komatsu _",
    "et al_.  @xcite uses the bispectrum and minkowski functional and constrains a @xmath3 deviation from gaussianity .",
    "the gravitational potential was parametrized as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gaussian linear perturbation of zero mean and it was concluded that @xmath6 at 95% cl .",
    "this constrains only a very peculiar type of non - gaussianity and does not apply e.g. to the models of refs .",
    "2 .   even if the form of the pdf is predicted theoretically , one needs to investigate what is measured and how the measurements are related to the theoretical predictions .",
    "the goal of this article is to investigate the observational implications of the theoretical predictions of ref .",
    "it requires further investigations in particular on the effect of finite volumes of the survey while the detailed comparison of our model to existing dataset , beyond the scope of this work , is still left for further studies .",
    "in particular , we want to show that these finite volume effects do not suppress the predicted non - gaussianity .",
    "section  [ sec_pb ] formulates the problem , focusing on the quantities that can actually be observed . in section  [ sec_mod ] ,",
    "we recall basics of the models we consider in this paper and give simple consequences .",
    "we then develop in section  [ sec_langevin ] some arguments to understand the effect of the mean value of the non - gaussian component on the size of the survey .",
    "section  [ sec_finitevol ] is devoted to the computation of the lowest order measured cumulants .",
    "in particular , we will show that there appears a non vanishing skewness that is directly induced by the finite volume effects as stressed in our concluding remarks , section  [ sec_concl ] .",
    "basically what we want to measure are the statistical properties of a scalar field @xmath7 of zero mean @xmath8 where and from now on angular brackets,@xmath9 , refer specifically to ensemble averages",
    ". such a scalar field will be in the following identified with the gravitational potential but the actual observations may be complex linear transforms of that field such as the temperature anisotropies or polarization of the cmb or the large - scale cosmic density fluctuations .",
    "the general questions raised by precision measurements of statistical properties of cosmic fields can be very intricate .",
    "we refer for instance to@xcite section  vi for extensive developments regarding such issues .",
    "we will restrict our discussion to the overall aspects of them .    in practice while performing such measurements , two scales enter the problem , the scale @xmath10 at which @xmath7 is measured ( e.g. somehow smoothed ) and the size @xmath11 of the survey .",
    "the smoothed field @xmath12 can be measured at different locations in the survey .",
    "the idea is that its spatial fluctuations should provide us with hints of the actual statistical properties of the field .",
    "ensemble averages are however inaccessible as such .",
    "the values of @xmath12 we have access to are in finite number and are all inherited from the a single stochastic process , the one of our universe .",
    "one can however get insights into the stochastic properties of @xmath7 from geometrical averages . in the following ,",
    "we denote such a geometrical average @xmath13 and its connected part @xmath14 .",
    "for instance one can have access to quantities such as @xmath15 the @xmath16 are themselves stochastic quantities that depend on the stochastic field @xmath7 . to be more specific we have @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a window function of volume unity and for simplicity assumed to be spherically symmetric , e.g. for a top hat filtering we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the heavyside function and @xmath22 the volume of the ball or @xmath23 for a gaussian window function .",
    "clearly quantities such as @xmath24 can not be estimated because they contain contributions from modes of wavelength larger than the size of the survey and that can not be observed .",
    "only modes with wavelength in a given range are measurable .",
    "this is in particular the case for a gaussian field . in this case",
    "one can show that if the two scales @xmath10 and @xmath11 are in large enough ratio , @xmath16 can be good estimates of @xmath25 , e.g. the expected dispersion of the measured values @xmath16 decreases with @xmath26 to a power that depends on the power spectrum shape . in our case",
    "however not only the super - hubble modes can not be measured but the modes that can be observed are correlated and also correlated to the super - hubble modes .    in the following , we will explore the consequences of both the fact that only modes in specific wavelength are measurable and that they are correlated .",
    "ideally , cosmological models should be able to predict the pdfs of the measured cumulants , @xmath27 but such predictions are obviously difficult to do in general .",
    "we will see in the following how we can estimate these distributions for some families of multi - field inflationary models .",
    "before we start to investigate the statistics of the observed quantities let us recall the basics of the models we have in mind . in the models",
    "@xcite , the non - gaussianities are first generated by an auxiliary field , @xmath7 , self - interacting in a potential , typically quartic , @xmath28 this field is assumed to be a test field so that it does not affect the dynamics of inflation driven by an other scalar field , @xmath29 . assuming an almost de sitter inflation and neglecting the gravitational back - reaction on the evolution of the universe , its evolution will be dictated by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the hubble constant and @xmath32 the comoving laplacian .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the cosmic time and @xmath35 , which is negative , the conformal time .",
    "for a free massless scalar field ( @xmath36 ) , the klein - gordon equation ( [ kgchi ] ) in the de sitter background takes the form @xmath37 where we have introduced @xmath38 .",

    "it implies that the field @xmath7 has a correlator given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the power spectrum , which is equal to @xmath46 on super - hubble scales for a free scalar field living in de sitter space .",
    "this is the so - called harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",
    "moreover , the self interaction term of @xmath7 induces non - zero high order correlation functions . for a quartic potential",
    "the odd order correlation functions vanish ; the even order ones can be computed from a perturbation theory approach at tree order .",
    "for instance , the four - point function in the super - hubble limit reads @xmath47 as explicitly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when one wants to relate the expectation values of observable quantities such as the @xmath16 to the statistical properties of the field , filtering effects should properly be taken into account .",
    "the observable quantities , @xmath48 , can be written in terms of the fourier modes , @xmath49 , as @xmath50 with @xmath51 it follows immediately that @xmath52 such an expression can be easily computed in case of a harrison - zeldovich spectrum and a @xmath53-space top - hat window function . defining @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the second moment of @xmath48 reduces to @xmath58    it follows from this calculation that the expectation value of the observable quantity @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 its ( cosmic ) variance , @xmath61 ,",
    "can similarly be computed and it scales like @xmath62 in case of a gaussian field   is expected to be strongly affected by the existence of a non - vanishing large - scale 4-point function for @xmath7 . but this is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate such effects . ] .",
    "furthermore , the expectation value of @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 expressing the 4-point correlator by mean of eq .",
    "( [ chi4pt ] ) and assuming a harrison - zeldovich spectrum and a top - hat window function in @xmath53-space , this expression finally reads @xmath65.\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ wtilde ] ) , simply expresses the condition @xmath67 and is inherited for the term @xmath68 .",
    "when the ratio @xmath69 is large this expression can be easily computed after noting that , in this case , one of the @xmath70 generically dominates over the others ( the contributions to the integral being roughly uniform over the integration domain when the wave - vector norms are logarithmicallly spaced ) . in this limit",
    "it is therefore possible to approximate @xmath71 by say @xmath72 and @xmath73 by @xmath74 .",
    "finally the integral reads , @xmath75 which corresponds to what has been found in our previous work provided the number of @xmath76-folds is identified with @xmath77 .",
    "it means that the kurtosis of the @xmath48 field is significant if @xmath78 approaches unity .",
    "this result demonstrates that the mechanism described in our previous study survives finite volume effects .",
    "we can also note that observable quantities are insensitive to the behavior of @xmath45 in the small @xmath53 limit .",
    "finite volume effects have however other consequences due to the fact that the observable modes are correlated .",
    "the physical reason of these correlations is that they share the same history , e.g. they have been produced in the same stochastic process .",
    "we found that a random walk approach for the evolution of the local @xmath7 field values gives precious insights on those more subtle finite volume effects .",
    "from the previous definitions , it is clear that @xmath79 and the different values of @xmath12 share contributions of super - hubble modes . those can not be observed but they shape the values of @xmath79 and @xmath12 . actually the value of @xmath80 at a given scale , whether it is @xmath11 or @xmath10 , is dynamically built from the stacking of modes that successively leave the horizon .    a random walk approach",
    "can then be used to describe the stochastic growth of @xmath80 .",
    "it will allow two things , to get insights into the excursion values of @xmath79 and to see how @xmath12 values are correlated through their common history . in this approach the field value evolution",
    "is described in term of a langevin eq during inflation .    before we go to this equation ,",
    "let us sort out how the different scales and evolution equation and related together .",
    "different scales will have to be distinguished in our study .",
    "* during the inflationary stage , the super - hubble modes of the scalar field can be treated as classical . in a de sitter spacetime ,",
    "the physical hubble radius is constant @xmath81 so that the comoving smoothing scale is time dependent , @xmath82 .",
    "the evolution equation of the classical part will thus contain a stochastic force simulating the effect of the quantum noise due to the modes which are crossing the horizon at each time step to become classical .",
    "we thus define a stochastic field , @xmath83 , for which the filtering scale is dependent and always equal to the horizon size , @xmath84 with @xmath85 so that @xmath86 the dynamics of @xmath87 will follow a langevin equation .",
    "we investigate the dynamics and the statistical properties of @xmath87 in section  [ subsec_langevin ] .",
    "* on the other hand the field values @xmath79 and @xmath12 can be seen as a time dependent quantity but they correspond to the filtering of @xmath7 at fixed physical scales .",
    "they identify though with @xmath87 at precisely the time @xmath35 at which the scales @xmath11 and @xmath10 respectively cross the horizon , e.g. @xmath88 and @xmath89 . after that these coincidental times the two fields @xmath79 and @xmath12 behave classically , i.e. follow an inflationary classical klein - gordon equation without stochastic source terms .",
    "to summarize , two of the comoving scales @xmath10 and @xmath90 are fixed while one , @xmath11 is a time dependent quantity .",
    "a sketch of the different sequences that the field dynamics follow are shown on fig .",
    "[ scales ] .",
