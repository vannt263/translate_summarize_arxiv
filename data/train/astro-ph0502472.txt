    "collapsed structures identified within the context of dissipationless cosmological simulations are invariably found to exhibit some invariant , or universal , form for their density profiles  irrespective of their mass or the epoch at which they are identified ( see , e.g. , and the references therein )  which , moreover , seems to reflect an invariant underlying phase space density distribution ( ) .",
    "these results are potentially of fundamental importance ; they may signal the existence of a generic tendency in initially cold and nearly homogeneous gravitational configurations to evolve towards definite final states , with a consistency reminiscent of that characterising the approach to a gibbs distributions in laboratory systems , irrespective of the details of the initial conditions or the intermediate dynamics .",
    "the existence of invariant final states in systems where the microscopic dynamics is known to be time reversible ( newtonian equations in our case ) inevitably echoes the protracted debate pertaining to irreversibility in laboratory statistical mechanics , the main conundrum being that such ` attractor ' like behaviour is characteristic of dissipative systems . nevertheless ,",
    "as is well known , dissipative dynamics can be effectively introduced in otherwise reversible systems by incorporating a degree of randomness .",
    "this can either be achieved by the presence of a fluctuating force , representing otherwise intractable interactions , or because the intrinsic dynamics is so complicated that tracking its detailed evolution from any given initial condition becomes impossible  the accompanying loss of information has consequences similar to the incorporation of random forces . systems where such processes are in action may exhibit the required macroscopic irreversibility that leads to invariant final states .",
    "even if , in the cosmological context , the ` universality ' may be only approximate , the relatively quaint state of affairs that transpires , rare in astrophysical research , has generated intense interest .",
    "discussions dealing with the origin of the identified density distributions can be broadly divided into two main theses along basic nature ( the profiles result from the initial collapse :  ) or nurture ( they arise from cumulative effect repeated mergers or interactions : ) lines .",
    "these situations encompass the two contexts alluded to above : irreversible evolution can either arise from the ` violent ' internal evolution involving complicated dynamics of the mean field during the initial collapse or merger events ; or phenomena arising from random encounters between , and dynamical friction forces on , component clumps .",
    "it is the latter category that concerns us here .",
    "the fact that haloes are _ always _ found to have basically the same forms for their profiles suggests that _ both arguments may be relevant _ : for , while numerical calculations simulating the cold collapse of isolated gravitational systems do indeed show that the process can account for halo profiles ( e.g. , hiotelis 2002 ) , a halo s tenure in the context of a cosmological environment will be punctuated by repeated mergers ; it will contain substructure , which will be constantly replenished by continual infall .",
    "the density distribution needs to be invariant under the action of such interactions if the profile is to survive .",
    "evidently , this will be the case if the underlying phase space structure is unaffected by the interactions .    in this paper",
    "we endevour to show that this is in fact true ; that the presence of substructure leaves the total phase space mass distribution of haloes with density distributions similar to those of cosmological - simulation - haloes ( at least approximately ) invariant .",
    "what needs to be shown is that when dynamical friction acts on clumps ( representing dark matter substructure ) inside a larger halo , causing them to sink towards the centre , the increased density that results from the mass deposition is precisely balanced by an outflow in the parent halo material ; and that mass stripping from clumps does not change that basic conclusion .",
    "since the evolution necessarily involves macroscopically irreversible behaviour , due to dynamical friction and random clump - clump encounters , the formulation presented in this paper may also shed light on the process of attainment of the universal profile _ via _ substructure interaction .",
    "though this issue is only touched upon briefly here .    as in laboratory statistical mechanics , effective randomness , born of the presence of granularity in a system , can be introduced by considering a _ macroscopic _ transport equation that contains a collision term where this randomness is incorporated . in the context of gravitational systems",
    "the usual approximation involves the fokker - planck equation , extensively used in the study of globular clusters for example ( spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "it has also been invoked in the context of cosmological haloes ( ) .",
    "the basic assumption in deriving it from more basic kinetic equations is that the encounters are weak .",
    "this implies that it can not describe the dynamics leading to major mergers between a few large components of roughly equal mass .",
    "the assumption however is well founded when what is involved is the gravitational interaction of a large number of clumps ( representing substructure ) and their motion though a smooth background medium ( representing a parent halo ) .",
    "this is the picture we will have in mind in this paper .    in section  [ sec : pasim ]",
    "we discuss simple numerical experiments illustrating the phase space dynamics of such a clump - background system . following this , in section  [ sec : physical ]",
    ", we tackle the question of correspondence between the almost exact phase space invariance present in these calculations and the persistence of density profiles in simulations of the significantly more sophisticated cosmological context .",
    "we then outline the fokker - planck formulation used in this paper ( section  [ sec : fp ] ) and apply it to pure power law systems ( section  [ sec : scalefree ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : times ] discusses the evolution timescales on which the total mass distribution changes , relative to the dynamical friction timescale it takes for the clumps to sink in .",
    "these are then applied to the power law solutions in section  [ sec : timescales ] . in section  [ sec : instab ] , the evolution of the _ individual _ components is considered in more detail .",
    "the consequences of the solutions obtained are outlined in several sections that follow . in particular",
    ", section  [ sec : core ] discusses the formation of a constant density core .",
    "this occurs in the background material if no stripping is invoked .",
    "the effect of stripping is dealt with in section  [ sec : strip ] .",
    "both configurations correspond to approximate equilibria , with the ones involving stripping longer lived .",
    "technical background material is outlined in several appendices .",
    "its inclusion was found necessary because of the variety of conventions , terminology and notation used in the literature of the fokker - planck equation as applied to gravitational systems .",
    "moreover , to the author s knowledge , derivations of some of the results required for this paper have only been been published in the ( french language ) paper of henon ( 1961 ) .",
    "alternative derivations are presented .",
    "[ fig : sim ] shows the density and velocity dispersion distributions of systems of massive clumps and smooth background .",
    "the simulations are identical to one of the runs presented in el - zant et al .",
    "the clumps are represented by softened point particles whose ` size ' is about @xmath4 of the scale length of the navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) initial density distribution .",
    "there are 900 000 background ( ` light ' ) particles through which moves a system of 900 clumps with combined mass representing @xmath5 the system s total .",
    "they are all started from the same initial density and velocity distributions .",
    "the system is spherically symmetric with isotropic velocities , and is evolved using a polar particle mesh code .",
    "as already noted by el - zant et al ( 2004 ) , the total density distribution of the clump - background system remains virtually unchanged for many dynamical times ( given in terms of the average density inside the initial halo scale length by @xmath6 ) ; it is identical , except perhaps at the very centre and up to statistical noise , to the passively evolved system containing no clumps .",
    "this statement is also true at all times smaller than the timescale shown in the figure ( the invariance breaks down completely on timescales almost an order of magnitude larger , for reasons we discuss in the next subsection ) .",
    "we have tried different values of the nfw concentration parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the results presented in this figure refer to a system with @xmath8 .",
    "we ran , in addition , simulations with of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with almost identical results .",
    "different heavy particle masses and fractions were also investigated . as long as the problem is rescaled in terms of the relevant dynamical and dynamical - friction ( see next subsection below ) timescales , the situation described by fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] remains for time intervals of the order of those shown .    in el - zant et al ( 2004 )",
    "we had interpreted the clump distribution to be composed of baryonic material . in that case , the conclusions outlined in that paper still stand : the dark matter , made of lighter background particles , is heated and forms a constant density core ; but the total distribution ( interpreted to be composed of baryons and dark matter ) remains constant . however",
    ", if the clumps are also made of dark matter , this invariance implies that the total distribution of dark matter remains constant .    a rather remarkable result , transpiring from fig .  [ fig : sim ] ,",
    "is that it is not only the physical density that remains unchanged , but also the velocity dispersion .",
    "the invariance of the velocity distribution is all the more remarkable because the initial ` temperature inversion '  the fact that the velocity dispersion decreases towards the centre  is a thermodynamically unstable state of affairs , that should be washed out under the action of energy transfer ; the system then evolving towards an isothermal distribution , as heat flows from hotter to colder regions .",
    "it so happens , nevertheless , that the ` heating ' of the lighter particles is precisely balanced by a corresponding ` cooling ' in the clump distribution , so as to keep the total ` temperature ' constant .",
    "the constancy of the mass and velocity dispersion distributions in a spherical isotropic system , where the distribution function is dependent only on energy , must be associated with an invariant phase space structure . in section  [ sec : physical ] we argue that _ this state of affairs , so stark in this idealised setting , may remain relevant , resulting in the observed persistence of universal profiles , in the highly more complex cosmological context . _",
    "the remainder of the paper is an attempt to explain and derive the simulations presented here , and to quantitatively justify this basic contention .      the state of affairs described by fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] is metastable ; in the sense it is long - lived , but not infinitely so .",
    "this should be obvious , since once the massive particles form a self gravitating component , relaxation resulting from their mutual interactions will result in evolution .    for timescales of order @xmath11",
    ", we have verified that the center expands , as energy is transferred from the outer hotter regions .",
    "this is in accordance to what was found , for example , by hayashi et al .",
    "although we have not performed integrations for longer intervals , it is expected that it would then proceed towards core collapse .",
    "the notion of solid clumps can not possibly be useful however in either of these regimes ; the effect of stripping , which will transform clump material into background , ensures that the former can never form an autonomous dynamical system ( cf . , section  [ sec : physical ] ) .",
    "we will see later in this paper ( section  [ sec : times ] and section  [ sec : instab ] ) , that the characteristic timescale for the evolution that significantly modifies the distribution of the ( light and heavy ) components , but keeps the total virtually invariant , is the local dynamical friction time",
    ". it will be useful therefore to parametrise the timescale of the simulation just analysed in terms of that quantity .    to get a rough estimate of the relation between the time the system is evolved in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] and the average dynamical friction time within a given radius , we write the latter as ( e.g. , el - zant , shlosman & hoffman 2001 )  .",
    "it also assumes that the velocity of the clumps is comparable to the dispersion of the background , which has a maxwellian velocity distribution . ]",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is of the total system mass inside radius @xmath14 divided by the mass of a clump and @xmath15 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "we denote this timescale with the label ` sim ' to distinguish it from an analogous timescale @xmath16 that we derive later , in a more rigorous manner , from diffusion coefficients ( section  [ sec : times ] ) .    for a system with significant softening ,",
    "as is the case here , @xmath17 is determined by the softening length .",
    "the maximum impact parameter can be taken as the radius inside which we are calculating the average dynamical friction timescale .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfsim ] the dynamical friction time , relative to the simulated timescale , for an nfw system with @xmath18 .",
    "note that the dynamical friction timescale is smaller than the simulated one only in the very inner region , and then only by a factor of a few .",
    "( it increases again , because the softening dominates .",
    "probably by then however , the formula above becomes entirely inadequate , the dynamics being dominated by a non - newtonian contributions to the softened potential ) .",
    "thus , in terms of dynamical friction time , the system is fairly young , despite it being of significant dynamical age ( parametrised in terms of @xmath19 ) .    to explain the results of the simulation discussed in section  [ sec : sim ]",
    "therefore , it suffices to show that the evolution timescales characterising the change in total phase space mass density of a system with central density cusp are much longer than the dynamical friction time . noting also that most of the evolution in the lighter component in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] takes place deep inside the @xmath20 cusp , it should be possible , for the purpose of explaining the aforementioned results , to approximate the system as a scale free configuration .",
    "there are two glaring idealisations pertaining to the calculations presented in the previous section : the heavier bodies are solid softened point particles ; they also all have the same mass .",
    "the advantage , of course , is that the simplified models serve as to highlight and isolate the interesting phenomenon involving the invariance of the phase space distribution  and identify its origin in the dynamical friction interaction between a distinguishable background and a system of massive objects , the number of which is large enough so that statistical reasoning may be relevant . but how do these toy models relate to the actual situation found in realistic simulations of halo evolution in the context of cdm cosmologies ? in other words , would the discovered invariance survive , at least in some approximate sense , the removal of the idealisations ?    in the following we attempt to make this connection the arguments are only suggestive ; though most are broadly supported by the analysis based on the fokker - planck formulation presented in subsequent sections of the paper , future detailed numerical investigation should also be undertaken .",
    "subhaloes found in cosmological simulations do not all have the same mass .",
    "indeed , their differential number distribution follows the rather steep mass function @xmath21 ( e.g. , gao et al 2004c ) .",
    "the mass is also a deciding factor as to how strongly a body will interact with a background  the rate of energy lost by that object varying as @xmath22 .",
    "it would thus appear that in the assumption of equal masses lies a drastic approximation , compromising the description of the evolution .",
    "nevertheless , it may precisely be the steep mass spectrum , and the sensitive dependence of the dynamical friction on the mass , that ensure that the situation described by the single ( clump ) mass model survives . for , by virtue of these properties , a separation of timescales will ensue ; the heavier mass clumps sinking in first , while the lower mass ones are hardly affected by dynamical friction .",
    "if clump - clump interaction is not of major importance , this initial evolution will mimic that of the single mass model ( clump - clump interaction will cause the dynamical evolution of small mass clumps to follow the background material ) .    the total distribution of the system just described is also an equilibrium .",
    "formally , we show in section  [ sec : fp ] , that the fundamental equation deciding the presence of an equilibrium is linear with respect to the distribution of massive objects : if a set of distributions , possibly corresponding to different mass species , is a zero of that equation , so is their sum ( or any linear combination thereof ) .",
    "thus , one can superpose an equilibrium distribution made of the evolved system , composed of the heaviest clumps plus background , and the distribution of the remaining ( non - participating ) clumps , which will remain unchanged if clump - clump interactions can be neglected ( or , if such interactions are included , to various distributions of the remaining clumps ) .",
    "there is a caveat .",
    "detailed invariance will require that the clumps representing substructure be initially distributed in a similar manner to the background .",
    "but the viability of a statistical description will be severely affected by the relatively small number of massive objects in each mass range .",
    "in particular , the most massive bodies , which initially contribute most , will be represented only by a few specimen .",
    "the invariance therefore would only hold in an ensemble averaged sense .",
    "ma & boylan - kolchin ( 2004 ) found that substructure may , in individual runs increase or decrease the steepness of density profiles ; and cosmological simulations do indeed show large scatter in the the profiles of identified haloes ( e.g. , klypin et al .",
    ". more work , involving a series of simulations representing a statistical sample of initial sustructure distribution and concentrations , in the controlled context of isolated halo calculations , is in order .    if the clumps come to completely dominate the mass distribution at small radii ( as happens to the evolved system in section  [ sec : sim ] ) , then the effect of dynamical friction will be limited to the most massive specimen  by the time , at any given energy , the dynamical friction coupling is strong enough to affect the next group of clumps , most of the background particles that these clumps should couple with would have been removed .",
    "one is then left with a region that can be best described as a system of self gravitating clumps , with fluctuating and dissipative forces roughly balancing each other , but where energy transfer ( ` relaxation ' ) leads to eventual evolution ( cf .",
    "sections  [ sec : theinvariance ] and  [ sec : core ] ) .",
    "it is quite likely however that stripping would be effective in transforming much of the substructure into background , before such a situation transpires .",
    "this represents another form of cutoff for the dynamical friction - mediated coupling .",
    "two question are clearly pertinent .",
    "they are concerned with the timescale for stripping and its effect on the total phase space mass distribution function .",
    "satellites can no longer be regarded as solid clumps if any of the following processes are efficient    1 .",
    "particles are removed from the satellites due to pruning by the background ( this includes the possibility of complete dissolution ) .",
    "particles are removed due to weak encounters with other satellites .",
    "satellites participate in strong mutual encounters or merge .",
    "the first of these mechanisms does not , to a very good approximation , change the total phase space mass distribution function : particles are gently removed from a satellite ; they leave with approximately the same velocity and position as the satellite .",
    "thus , material with virtually the same location in phase space is transferred from clump to background , the total phase space mass density remaining nearly constant .",
    "this will also be true of the second mechanism .",
    "weak encounters will lead to the gentle removal of particles , they may also facilitate stripping by the main halo ( cf . pennerubia & benson 2004 ) , both processes through which the total phase space mass distribution is closely conserved .",
    "the situation is different however if violent encounters and mergers are involved .",
    "it is possible to estimate the timescale associated with such events by averaging the clump distribution inside a given radius and invoking an effective collision crossection .",
    "the envisioned ` collisions ' will not necessarily lead to mergers ( this will depend on their orbital parameters etc ) , but we will assume that when two satellites so interact , particles in their outer regions can be removed with significantly modified phase space coordinates ..    the collision mean free time for a randomly moving system of @xmath23 spheres of radius @xmath24 , confined within a spherical volume of radius @xmath14 , can be written as ( e.g. , saslaw 1985 ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 , is the time for an object to make one full crossing of the system .",
    "clumps of different masses will have different diameters , but one can define an effective crossection @xmath27 let the differential mass function @xmath28 , and the characteristic radius of a clump be @xmath29 , where the parameter @xmath30 relates the virial radius and mass ( it depends on the redshift and the cosmology ; cf .",
    "a1 of nfw ) and @xmath31 is the typical fraction of the virial radius of a clump that survives stripping by means of mechanisms i ) and ii ) in the list above . in this context we can write @xmath32 where we have assumed that the maximal mass in the clump distribution is at least a few orders of magnitude larger than the minimal one .    confider a radius @xmath33 , inside a host halo of virial mass @xmath34 , and containing @xmath35 satellites .",
    "we can rewrite eq  ( [ eq : freet ] ) in these terms , replacing @xmath36 by the effective crossection @xmath37 , @xmath38 if @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( e.g. , if @xmath41 is of order @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "this represents an average collisional timescale inside the virial radius .",
    "it is necessarily a lower limit , because it effectively assumes that stripping by the host halo , or _ via _",
    "weak encounters , is negligible ( hence @xmath44 ) .    as one averages over smaller radii ( that is @xmath45 ) ,",
    "our estimate of @xmath46 will depend on how the ratio @xmath47 changes . a simple single power law that can be taken as a reasonable representation of the density distribution of host and satellites is @xmath48 ( we discuss this further in section  [ sec : scalefree ] ) .",
    "in this case , it is easy to show ( e.g. , el - zant , kim & kamionkowski 2004 ) that the tidal radius of a satellite is proportional to its radial position inside the host halo  that is @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath50 necessarily decreases with @xmath14 , this suggests that the above estimate at the virial radius is indeed a lower limit  not only there , but at all radii .    during a time interval @xmath46",
    ", substructure continues to be radically modified due to stripping by the host halo ; as can be seen from fig .",
    "11 of taylor & babul ( 2004 ) for example , where for almost all haloes , well over @xmath51 of satellite mass is lost on such a timescale ( note that the radial period used there @xmath52 ; and that the authors do not consider clump - clump interactions at all .",
    "not even weak encounters ) .",
    "it therefore appears unlikely that strong encounters or mergers will be important at any stage during the evolution  haloes being affected by gentle stripping on a significantly shorter timescale .",
    "finally , note that only a substructure satellite for which @xmath53 will be affected by dynamical friction before most of its mass is lost _ via _ stripping . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfsim ] ) it should have @xmath54 . thus stripping eventually puts an effective end to the dynamical friction coupling .",
    "the discussion of the present section suggests that a situation whereas sinking clumps would come to dominate the mass distribution within a certain region ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] ) probably would not , in practice , arise  satellites having been significantly stripped long before such a configuration materialises  but that , nevertheless , the invariance found there will remain if    1 .   stripping is due to gentle removal of particles from clumps due to their interaction with background or soft mutual encounters .",
    "2 .   substructure distributions , properly modified to take into account the effect of stripping , also constitute ( at least approximate ) equilibria .",
    "the estimates of the mean free time presented here suggest that the first condition is satisfied . in section  [ sec : strip ] we show that distributions satisfying condition  2 are indeed excellent approximate equilibria .",
    "in fact , as may already be expected from the discussion above , such configurations are much longer lived , as they do not suffer from the problem of relaxation , characteristic of a system composed of self gravitating clumps .",
    "the fokker - planck equation has been discussed in the context of gravitational systems in several textbooks ( saslaw 1985 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; sptizer 1987 ) .",
    "the basic assumption is that the perturbations due to the granularity in a system are weak , local and random .",
    "the situation is then analogous to that of brownian motion in a laboratory setting .",
    "the dynamical variables therefore undergo a random walk , the amplitude of which is limited by a deterministic force .",
    "chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) reviewed these phenomena , both in the case of laboratory systems , where the approximations involved are much more easily justifiable , and the gravitational case ; for which he derived an explicit formula for the deterministic force , that he dubbed dynamical friction .",
    "it proved remarkably successful in the face of numerical tests , despite the problems associated with justifying the assumptions of locality and randomness ( e.g. zaritsky & white 1988 ) .",
    "the ratio of the amplitude of the fluctuating force causing the random walk to that of dynamical friction is determined by the mass of the object in question relative to that of the perturbers in the background .",
    "this implies that more massive particles will typically have smaller velocities ; in the gravitational context , they will sink to the centre of the system .",
    "the timescale for this to happen we call the dynamical friction time .",
    "( [ eq : dfsim ] ) represents an estimate derived on the basis of the chandrasekhar formula alluded to above .",
    "other evaluations can be directly deduced from the fokker - planck formulation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : times ] ) .",
    "the energy deposited among the population of lighter particles causes their velocities to increase and their distribution to expand .",
    "the principal object of this paper is to show that these processes leave the total phase space mass density invariant for timescales significantly longer than the dynamical friction time ( so as to be negligible on timescales of that order ) . in physical space",
    ", that would correspond to the expansion of the lighter particle system being almost exactly compensated by the inflow of massive clumps .",
    "provided that the dynamical friction time is significantly longer than the orbital timescale ( @xmath55 ) , the fokker - planck equation can be averaged over particle trajectories , and expressed in terms of the integrals of motion in the smoothed out potential .",
    "the orbit averaged fokker - planck equation and its properties have been elucidated in detail by henon ( 1961 ) , and discussed in binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) and spitzer ( 1987 ) .",
    "other works include that of kohn ( 1979 , 1980 ) and merritt ( 1983 ) , the latter being particularly relevant to the situation at hand here .",
    "in the case when the configuration is spherical and has isotopic velocity distribution , as we will assume here , the six dimensional phase space is also spherically symmetric .",
    "the relevant integral of motion is the energy _ per unit mass _ e , which defines a radial coordinate in that space , in terms of which the distribution function and the fokker - planck equation may be written .   in this paper",
    "refers to the energy , and not to the binding energy , which has opposite sign , favoured in some of the aforementioned work . ]    we will not be using the fokker planck equation directly here , but instead relations for the change in mass and energy , within a given surface @xmath56 , that can be readily derived from it ( e.g. , henon 1961 and appendices  [ app : mass ] and  [ app : energy ] of the present paper ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is twofolds .",
    "first , the fokker - planck equation itself allows for solutions with non - vanishing constant mass flux . these are steady state solutions , even though they are unphysical , unless there is something to produce or absorb particles at the center of the system , a possibility we do not consider here .",
    "the second is that steady state solutions of the fokker planck equation do not guarantee thermodynamic stability , we will need to estimate the effect of energy transfer on the steady state ( cf .",
    ", section  [ sec : energychange ] ) .        for the mass evolution we have ( appendix  [ app : mass ] ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the phase space mass density distribution function  that is , the amount of mass contained in a volume element @xmath59 is @xmath60 .",
    "this equation simply says that the rate of mass change inside the energy surface @xmath61 is determined by the mass flux @xmath62  that is , the amount of mass , per unit time , that enters ( negative sign ) or exists the phase space volume bounded by the energy surface @xmath61  and the mass acquired or lost at the edge of this volume because of its variation with time .",
    "that phase space volume is related to the potential ; since , in a spherical phase space , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( here @xmath65 is the maximum radius out to which a particle with specific energy @xmath61 can travel ) .",
    "the ` density of states ' @xmath66 , the area _ in phase space _ of the surface with energy @xmath61 , relates to the volume inside that surface by @xmath67 .",
    "accordingly , the mass enclosed within an energy interval @xmath68 $ ] is @xmath69 ; and the total mass within the surface at @xmath61 : @xmath70    note that , even when the fokker plank flux @xmath62 is zero , the mass distribution may be time dependent .",
    "this state of affairs is characteristic , for example , of smooth ( collisionless ) systems in configurations out of dynamical equilibrium . in this paper",
    "we assume that we are dealing not with the merger of a few clumps of comparable mass , but with a large number of them and a smooth background , with the combined system having reached a slowly evolving quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "any evolution must therefore arise from the flux @xmath62 describing the collisional evolution .",
    "we will therefore ignore evolution driven solely by the second term on the right hand side of  ( [ eq : fok ] ) .",
    "comparison of the isotropic fokker planck equation in flux conservation form ( eq .",
    "[ eq : fpfc ] ) and its standard format ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ; spitzer 1987 ) yields @xmath71 from which follows the equation for the flux @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 and where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : d1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : d2 ] ) .",
    "the fokker - planck flux is due to the deterministic and random forces , acting on the components of the system due to their mutual interactions ( as discussed in the last subsection ) .",
    "the changes in energies that result from these forces are represented by the diffusion coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "it is possible to heuristically describe how their forms , and the accompanying expression for the flux , arise .    when ( [ eq : de ] ) and  ( [ eq : dee ] ) are inserted into  ( [ eq : fluxp ] ) , this expression is seen to consist of three components .",
    "the first term , due to the component @xmath79 of  ( [ eq : fluxp ] ) , i.e.  @xmath80 , refers to a shell in phase space of volume @xmath81 . on average , due to systematic change in energy @xmath82 , particles will traverse such a shell during a unit time interval .",
    "that is , particles crossing a surface at @xmath56 in a unit time interval , b will come from this shell .",
    "the mass inside that shell is the volume multiplied by the phase space mass density .",
    "hence the expression @xmath80 .",
    "the random fluctuations characterised by @xmath83 , as opposed to their weighed gradients discussed below , can not produce a particle flux unless the distribution function has a gradient  because particles will be as likely to enter or leave energy surface @xmath61 . the rms energy space",
    "` length ' traversed in unit time by a typical particle due to random fluctuation is @xmath84 .",

    "if the interaction due to dynamical friction leaves the system in equilibrium , it will remain so in the presence of tidal stripping .",
    "one nevertheless still needs to show that satellite distributions that are affected by stripping also correspond to long lived equilibrium states for the total mass distribution .",
    "suppose now the stripping turns most of the mass in clumps into background materials for energies @xmath340 .",
    "then the role of the two components are reversed from what was described in section  [ sec : approxal ] .",
    "now , as appears to be the situation in evolved cosmological systems , it is the satellite distribution which would have a lower energy cutoff and develop a core ( in physical space ) , while the background would have a cusp . in that case , instead of substituting @xmath147 into eq .",

    ", in a realistic system , the distribution of clumps would be more complicated .",

    "the principal conclusion of this paper is that the phase space mass distribution associated with density distributions akin to the ` universal ' halo profiles are approximately invariant under the action of the interaction induced by the presence of substructure satellites ; which is shown to lead to negligible evolution over timescales comparable to halo lifetimes .",
    "this conclusion applies to the central region ( @xmath343 ) , where the dynamical friction coupling is strongest , and up to radii where the profile can be approximated as @xmath48 .    since haloes in cosmological simulations build up from smaller components ; are continually incorporating infalling material ; and retain significant substructure throughout their evolution , this is a necessary condition for the observed universal forms , apparently present at all redshifts and mass ranges  even if the initial collapse naturally leads to the ` right ' distribution , evolution driven by the presence of substructure will modify it , unless the total mass distribution is shown to be invariant over relevant timescales .",

    "clumps and background are coupled via dynamical friction interaction .",
    "the clumps move in , the lighter background particles move out , the total remains the same .",
    "this equation , which we have shown in terms of distribution functions in energy space , naturally leads to invariance in physical space .",
    "it is unmodified by the effect of inter - substructure interaction in the form of weak encounters .",
    "we presented simple simulations which showed that for dozens of dynamical times ( inside the initial scale length @xmath160 ) , the physical as well as velocity space total distributions remain invariant under the dynamical friction mediated interaction between a ( solid ) clumpy component and a background of far lighter particles  despite the fact that , during that same timescale , the distribution of each component is radically modified ( section  [ sec : sim ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper had the two principal goals : 1 ) to explain the results of these simple simulations and 2 ) to discuss , both from the qualitative and quantitative viewpoints , the relevance of such idealised models to the more complex context of cosmological simulations .",
    "the conceptual and computational framework employed is based on a fokker - planck formulation , dividing self gravitating structures into two components : a background made of light particles and a system of clumps representing substructure satellites .",
    "the latter are assumed to interact with the background _ via _ dynamical friction , and among themselves through weak gravitational encounters .",
    "although we usually have in mind a system where the background dominates , this is not an _ a priori _ assumption of the model .",
    "it shows ( section  [ sec : scalefree ] ) that there are exact scale free solutions for cusps with both components having scale free density distributions @xmath344 , and @xmath136 .",
    "this solution , already found for single mass systems by evans & collett ( 1997 ) , is generalised for the case of clump - background systems considered here .",
    "as long as the massive clumps are much heavier than the background particles , any mass distribution of the former is allowed ; by virtue of the linearity of the fundamental equation for the mass flux ( sec  [ sec : linfun ] ) .",
    "power law distributions , in the whole range of @xmath345 , are in approximate equilibrium , both in terms of the mass and energy transfer ; the total mass distribution in phase space remaining constant for many dynamical friction times ( sec .",
    "[ sec : timescales ] ) .",
    "solutions with @xmath346 do not correspond to any power law found in the central regions of cosmological haloes .",
    "but they are faithful representations of the phase space structure at intermediate radii ( up to the virial radius for haloes of small concentration ; section  [ sec : scalefree ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , when @xmath157 and @xmath158 power laws can no longer be taken as faithful represntations of the density distribution , there can , in principle , be a large mass flux towards higher energies , if dynamical friction is not completely negligible at these radii , and if they contain a significant fraction of the halo mass ( section  [ sec : steep ] ) .",
    "even when the total mass distribution function is constant , there is continuous evolution in the distribution of each of the components .",
    "two cases may be distinguished , depending on how efficient the stripping of the massive clumps is .    in the case",
    "when the clumps are considered as solid objects , we show that the evolution of each of the components away from the initial power law function takes the form of an exponential instability , which we termed the ` segregation instability ' , and which takes place on a characteristic timescale comparable to the local dynamical friction time .",
    "it involves the replacement of lighter particles , which gain energy and exit lower energy levels , by the massive clumps ( section  [ sec : instab ] ) .",
    "this results in a situation whereby the distribution of light background particles develops a low energy cutoff in energy space  with a corresponding constant density core in physical space ( section  [ sec : core ] ) , in line with the evolution of the idealised @xmath23-body models discussed in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "long lived solutions for such models are given in section  [ sec : approxal ] .",
    "situations whereas substructure is formed by dissipationless collapse are unlikely to be represented by such models for any significant period of time .",
    "nevertheless , these may be relevant if the clumps are made of significantly denser baryonic material ; which is more resistant to dissolution _ via stripping _ , because it dissipated during collapse ( e.g. gao et al .",
    "one then recovers the situation described by el - zant et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , where a core developed in the light dark matter particles but the total density distribution remained largely unchanged .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by gao et al ( 2004a ) in a much more sophisticated cosmological setting .",
    "if the timescale for mass loss from clumps  stripping  is significantly smaller than the segregation time , a cutoff in the _ satellite _ distribution function may result instead , with an accompanying constant density core in the physical space distribution of that component .",
    "this appears to be what happens in the context of dissipationless cosmological simulations .    in section  [ sec : striptease ] we had argued that stripping does not modify the total mass distribution function .",
    "therefore , if the dynamical friction interaction between clumps and background , and weak encounters between clumps , do not modify that distribution function , it suffices to show that solutions that take into account stripping  that is ones incorporating a low energy cutoff in the clump distribution  can be long lived .",
    "such solutions , valid up to a thousand dynamical friction times ( much longer than the age of cosmological haloes ) , are given in section  [ sec : strip ] .    finally , it is interesting to note that , whereas in the case of a single mass system , or a multimass systems without stripping , the only solutions with no energy transfer ( i.e. , thermodynamically stable configuration ) , are isothermal spheres , the case may be different when there is a mass spectrum and stripping is effective  ( section  [ sec : energysol ] ) .",
    "several issues raised in this paper would seem to require numerical work , either by means of the fokker - planck equation or direct simulations , to be settled in a satisfactory manner .",
    "the two approaches are complementary : the full simulations including fewer physical assumptions and the fokker - planck models corresponding to more controlled calculations that are computationally far less intensive .",
    "the question concerning statistical effects arising from the finite number of subhaloes , and the contention that stripping does not modify the total mass distribution function ( both discussed in section  [ sec : physical ] ) , need to be empirically verified by means of full simulations , involving live @xmath23-body satellites .",
    "other issues are best treated by a combination of the two approaches .",
    "the effects of a mass spectrum and stripping may be explicitly included in fokker - planck models ( merritt 1983 ) .",
    "it is also possible to incorporate a prescription for the evolution of the halo mass distribution  as was done for example by nusser & sheth ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors used a stable clustering formulation , supplemented by an algorithm for the effect of dynamical friction on substracture and associated back reaction on the main halo .",
    "because they have assumed that energy lost by sinking satellites is redistributed homogeneously among parent halo particles , their conclusion was that sinking substructure causes a steepening of the cusp , invalidating the ` universality ' assumption .",
    "their basic model nevertheless remains relevant and can be coupled to the fokker - planck formulation , which provides a much better representation of the effect of energy deposition by substructure ( which in fact is better approximated as a local phenomenon ) .    of prime interest",
    "is the issue of stability , touched upon in the introduction  whether the effectively dissipational interaction due to the presence of substructure may lead to an ` attractor ' like behaviour , with systems tending to preferred configurations similar to those observed in the large simulations .",
    "there are several related points that are raised by the material presented here .    the fundamental conclusion of this paper , the invariance of the total phase space mass density distribution under the action of the dynamical friction coupling , strictly speaking holds only when _ both components _ initially have the same phase space distributions .",
    "simple considerations involving the direction of phase space fluxes and their gradients ( section  [ sec : scalefree ] ) suggest that power law systems may expand if the the clumps distribution rises less steeply than the background , and contract if the situation is reversed .",
    "what is available in terms of numerical data tends to confirm this .",
    "for example , el - zant , hoffman & shlosman ( 2001 ) ran monte carlo simulations where solid substructure was given homogeneous spatial initial conditions inside an nfw halo ; the combined system was started from virial equilibrium and left to relax towards detailed dynamical equilibrium ; the dynamical friction , modelled on the chandrasekhar formula , was then turned on",
    ". the total density distribution decreased .",
    "heuristically , one may explain this from the fact that the binding energy available , per unit mass , is larger the more diffuse distribution . nevertheless , this issue is of sufficient importance so as to merit further work , involving a series of simulations whereby the spatial distribution of substructure within the halo , as well as the internal structure of individual clumps is varied .",
    "the material in sections  [ sec : scalefree ] and  [ sec : timescales ] suggest that single power law systems with flat cusp ( @xmath223 ) are only marginally unstable  they would evolve on a dynamical friction time only when @xmath347 ( which may be taken to represent the nearly homogeneous centre of a system ) and when the mass fraction in clumps is comparable to that in the background . whether any evolution actually occurs will clearly depend on if stripping is effective enough in order to quench the evolution , by modifying the mass ratio and cutting the source of the flux before any actual evolution takes place .",
    "it is of interest to determine under what ( if any ) condition evolution does occur , and whether this happens in the direction of the cusps characterisitc of cosmological haloes .",
    "finally , there is the issue of whether the large evolution flux associated with the very outer parts of haloes ( @xmath117 ; see section  [ sec : steep ] ) has any significance in determining the structure of the outer profiles . dealing with these regions",
