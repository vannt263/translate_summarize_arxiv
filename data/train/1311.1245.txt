    "we aim to study the oscillations of a thin flexible plate interacting with an inviscid potential flow in which it is immersed . in the literature , many models have been suggested to accommodate various configurations and physical parameters . in this treatment",

    "( k - j ) flow conditions in a flow - plate model of great recent interest . the k - j condition is stated in @xcite as taking  a zero pressure jump off the wing and at the trailing edge \" ; in line with the analyses in @xcite , we take this to correspond to taking the _ acceleration potential _ of the flow to be zero outside the plate , in the plane of the plate . in this analysis",
    "we take _ clamped plate boundary conditions _ in order to focus on the abstract problems associated to the pde analysis of the k - j condition .",
    "in fact , preliminary investigations indicate that free plate boundary conditions may better accommodate the k - j flow conditions  this is in line with certain engineering applications ( e.g. flag type models @xcite ) .",
    "however there are many technical challenges associated to pde models of flow - plate interactions when the plate boundary conditions are not of homogeneous type .",
    "more specifically , we address a flow - structure pde model which describes the interactive dynamics between a plate and a surrounding potential flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the novel feature of our analysis is the implementation of the k - j flow condition in the model considered in @xcite . in the aforementioned analyses , a more straightforward ( neumann type )",

    "panel _ configuration . to extend the analysis to more general ( physical ) configurations , well - posedness of the model",
    "must be established with the k - j flow condition of recent interest @xcite ( see section [ physicals ] for more discussion ) .",
    "our goals in the treatment are therefore ( 1 ) to make precise the k - j boundary condition in the three dimensional model found in @xcite and provide a well - posedness result , and , ( 2 ) to relate two existing mathematical analyses of flow - plate models found in @xcite and @xcite .    for simplicity in exposition ,",
    "we first consider a linear plate in our arguments .",
    "nonlinearity is then included , as it required for accuracy in modeling ; however , it is nonessential to demonstrate the principal mechanisms at play with respect to the k - j condition .",
    "the considerations @xcite address the nonlinear aspects of the model in great detail .",
    "we address the nonlinear nature of the plate , and provide a discussion of the critical properties of the nonlinear model in section [ physicals ] .",

    "the oscillatory behavior of the plate is governed by the second order ( in time ) kirchoff plate equation .",
    "the principal point of interest in this treatment is the linear theory . in section [ physicals ]",
    "we briefly mention certain ` physical ' nonlinearities which are used in the modeling of the large oscillations of thin , flexible plates  so called _ large deflection theory_.    the environment we consider is @xmath22 .",

    "we normalize @xmath27 to be mach 1 , i.e. @xmath28 corresponds to subsonic flows .",
    "often in modeling panels , clamped or hinged boundary conditions are considered @xcite .",
    "see the treatments for more details on these plate boundary conditions and the corresponding coupling with the flow .",
    "we analyze a general nonlinear plate equation , taken without rotational inertia .",
    "the coupling with the flow takes place in the external pressure term acting on the plate via the _ acceleration potential _ of the flow .",

    "this energy is well - behaved and bounded from below @xcite .    in the case of supersonic flows , or in the case of subsonic flows",
    "_ with _ the k - j condition in place , this procedure leads to an energy which is unbounded ( from below ) for the flow component of the model .",
    "hence , in line with the analysis of the supersonic flows ( with standard flow boundary conditions ) in @xcite , we make use of the flow acceleration multiplier @xmath47 for the _ subsonic flow _ , taken with the _ k - j _ flow boundary conditions .",
    "thus for the flow dynamics , instead of @xmath48 we seek invariance for @xmath49 .",
    "this leads to the following ( formal ) energies , arrived at via green s theorem when the multipliers @xmath45 and @xmath50 are applied to : @xmath51 these energies provide the formal energy relation for the system ( implementing the k - j conditions ) @xmath52>_{\\omega } dt = { { \\mathcal{e}}}(0).\\ ] ] this energy relation provides motivations for viewing the dynamics as the sum of a generating piece and a ` perturbation ' .",
    "finite energy constraints manifest themselves in the natural requirements on the functions @xmath20 and @xmath53 : @xmath54 @xmath55 the above finite energy constraints lead to the _ finite energy space _ : @xmath56    we see above that the primary source of mathematical difficulty lies in interpreting and unravelling the energy relation in .",
    "in fact , this representation of the energies in ( [ energies ] ) provides a good topological measure for the potential solution ; however the energy balance is _ lost _ in ( [ energyrelation ] ) when making use of the state variable @xmath50 and , in addition , the boundary term involves the traces of @xmath57 solutions of the flow , which are possibly _ not defined _ at all . in view of these complications ,",
    "our approach is be based on ( 1 ) developing a suitable theory for the traces of the flow solutions ( as in @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) counteracting the loss of energy balance relation .      in the discussion below , we will encounter strong ( classical ) , generalized ( mild ) , and weak ( variational ) solutions . in our analysis",
    "we will be making use of semigroup theory , hence we will work with _",
    "generalized _ solutions ; these are strong limits of strong solutions .",
    "these solutions satisfy an integral formulation of ( [ flowplate ] ) , and are called _ mild _ by some authors .",
    "topologically , generalized solution are finite energy solutions ( i.e. @xmath58 ) and are elements of the space @xmath59 .",
    "that is to say that they satisfy the regularity properties in ( [ flowreq ] ) , ( [ platereq ] ) .",
    "these solutions are obtained as strong limits of solutions which originate in the domain of the generator given by ( [ dom - ba - n ] ) .",
    "generalized solutions correspond to semigroup solutions for an initial datum outside of the domain of the generator .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.5.5 ) and @xcite for more detailed discussion of solutions .",
    "in fact , in the context of linear problems ( and the nonlinear models addressed in section [ physicals ] ) generalized solutions are in fact _ weak solutions _ ,",
    "i.e. , they satisfy the corresponding variational forms ( see definition 6.4.3 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) ) .",
    "the original flow - plate interaction ( for the clamped plate ) was discussed numerically in @xcite .",
    "we note that in these original considerations ( in the panel configuration ) the standard flow boundary condition was taken . in the monograph @xcite",
    ", the authors consider the flow - plate model abstractly in the case of subsonic flows , and show well - posedness .",
    "later , the subsonic case was considered @xcite and cast into a semigroup framework .",
    "finally , in @xcite a thorough treatment is given ( again in the subsonic case ) utilizing a viscosity method and obtaining hidden regularity of associated flow traces .",
    "in all of these cases , the standard boundary conditions and subsonic nature of the flow provide a _ good _ energy relation .",
    "however , the flow energy itself becomes degenerate for supersonic flows in this configuration .",
    "this degeneracy necessitates a  change of state variable \" ( @xmath60 ) in order to recover the validity of the flow energy ; however , this comes at the cost of polluting the _ energy relation_. correspondingly , the well - posedness of the flow - plate system for supersonic flows was an open question until recently @xcite .",
    "in this manuscript , the authors take the approach of recovering the dynamics ( after the change of state variable ) by viewing them as the sum of a generating component and a perturbation , where there perturbation corresponds to the  energy polluting \" term in the energy relation .",
    "ultimately , to handle this perturbation , a suitable trace theory must be developed for the flow term @xmath61 $ ] , which is a priori undefined ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the key insight into the present analysis occurs at the level of the energy relation . for flow models which call for the k - j boundary condition",
    ", we may again utilize the state variable @xmath50 ( rather than @xmath46 ) ; doing so , we arrive at the same energy relation in the case of supersonic flows ( as discussed in the preceding paragraph ) .",
    "this indicates that the abstract approach ( i.e. the decomposition of the dynamics ) taken in the supersonic case with standard boundary conditions will in fact accommodate the k - j boundary conditions , if a suitable trace theory can be developed for the flow .",
    "we pause here to mention another approach to the study of a similar flow - plate model ; the author of @xcite considers a linear _ wing _ immersed in a subsonic flow ; the wing is taken to have a high aspect ratio thereby allowing for the suppression of the span variable , and reducing the analysis to individual chords normal to the span . by reducing the problem to a one dimensional analysis , many technical hangups are avoided , and fourier - laplace analysis is greatly simplified .",
    "ultimately , the problem of well - posedness and @xmath63 regularity of solutions can be realized in the context of the classical _ possio integral problem _",
    "@xcite , involving the inverse hilbert transform and analysis of mikhlin multipliers @xcite . in our approach",
    ", we attempt to characterize our solution by similar means and point out how the two dimensional analysis greatly complicates matters and gives rise to singular integrals in higher dimensions .",
    "we also mention the confluence of our approach and the papers mentioned above in remark [ bal1 ] .",
    "the main result of this paper provides existence , uniqueness and continuous dependence on the data of finite energy solution .",
    "this result is obtained under a technical trace regularity condition imposed on aeroelastic potential , and stated in condition [ le : ftr0 ] . in the case",
    "when the flow domain is two dimensional , the validity of this condition is proved herein ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we do not discuss this condition in detail here to avoid clouding the exposition .",
    "additionally , as discussed above , we focus on the linear theory in the arguments below .",
    "however , our analysis ( as in @xcite ) applies to the case of nonlinear plates .",
    "we have provided a description of the pertinent nonlinearities and critical properties in section [ physicals ] .",
    "the final result reads as follows :    with reference to the model ( [ flowplate ] ) , with @xmath64 :    1 .   assuming @xmath65 is _ locally lipschitz _ , 2 .   assuming the trace regularity condition [ le : ftr0 ] holds for the aeroelastic potential @xmath66 ,    then there exists a unique finite energy solution that is local in time .",
    "this is to say , there exists @xmath67 such that @xmath68 for all initial data @xmath69 .",
    "this solution depend continuously on the initial data .",
    "+ if in addition , we take @xmath70 to be the von karman nonlinearity , the berger nonlinearity , or kirchoff type nonlinearity ( section 6.1 ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , resp . ) , then the solution above is global in time . in other words ,",
    "the nonlinear dynamical system generates a continuous semigroup @xmath71 on the space @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , when we restrict to the lower dimensional case ( and consider nonlinearities which are analogous to those listed in section 6.1 in two dimensions ) we have :    [ c:1 ] in the case when the dimension of @xmath72 is one , condition [ le : ftr0 ] is satisfied .",
    "hence , in that case , any semiflow defined by ( [ flowplate ] ) with nonlinear function subject to the hypotheses of proposition [ abstractnonlin ] generates a continuous semigroup .",
    "the generation of semigroups for an arbitrary three dimensional flow is subjected to the validity of the trace condition [ le : ftr0].this , in turn , depends on invertibility properties of finite riesz - type transforms in two dimensional domains . while it is believed that this property should be generically true , at the present stage this appears to be an open question in the analysis of singular integrals and depends critically on the geometry of @xmath72 in two dimensions .",
    "we briefly outline our approach :    1 .",
    "as motivated by the supersonic analysis in @xcite , we decompose the linear dynamics into a dissipative piece @xmath73 ( unboxed below ) and a perturbation piece @xmath74 ( boxed below ) : @xmath75&\\text { in }   { { \\omega}}\\times ( 0,t),\\\\ u={\\partial_{\\nu}}u = 0 & \\text { on } { { \\partial}}{{\\omega}}\\times ( 0,t).\\\\ \\end{cases}\\ ] ] we then proceed to show that @xmath73 ( corresponding to the unboxed dynamics above ) is @xmath76-dissipative on the state space . dissipativity is natural and built in within the structure of the problem , while maximality requires analysis of the zaremba problem ( mixed flow boundary conditions ) .",
    "2 .   to handle the  perturbation \" of the dynamics , @xmath74 ( boxed ) we cast the problem into an abstract boundary control @xcite framework following the analysis in @xcite .",
    "in order to achieve this , the critical ingredient in the proof is demonstrating  hidden \" boundary regularity for the acceleration potential @xmath50 of the flow . it will be shown that this component is an element of a negative sobolev space @xmath77 , based on an assumption about special integral transform related to the finite hilbert transform .",
    "the above regularity allows us to show that the term @xmath78>$ ] is well - defined via duality .",
    "consequently , the problem with the  perturbation \" of the dynamics @xmath74 , can be recast as an abstract boundary control problem with appropriate continuity properties of the control - to - state maps .",
    "3 .   then , to piece the operators together as @xmath79 , we make use of variation of parameters with respect to the generation property of @xmath73 and appropriate dual setting .",
    "this yields an integral equation on the state space ( interpreted via duality ) which must be formally justified in our abstract framework .",
    "this is critically dependent upon point ( 2 . ) above .",
    "we then run a fixed point argument on the appropriate space to achieve a local - time solution for the fully linear cauchy problem representing formally the evolution @xmath80 . in order to identify its generator ,",
    "we apply ball s theorem @xcite which then yields global solutions .",
    "we introduce the standard linear plate operator with clamped boundary conditions : @xmath81 with the domain @xmath82 additionally , @xmath83 .",
    "take our state variable to be @xmath84 we work with @xmath50 as an independent state variable , i.e. , we are not explicitly taking @xmath85 here .    to build our abstract model ,",
    "let us first define the operator @xmath86 by @xmath87 \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] the domain of @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 \\in l_2(\\omega ) \\end{array } \\right .",

    "as a first step , we show that @xmath73 is m - dissipative .",
    "the operator @xmath73 is @xmath76-dissipative on @xmath59 .",
    "hence , via the lumer - philips theorem , it generates a c@xmath90 semigroup of contractions .",
    "we employ the following inner product on our state space : for @xmath91    @xmath92    with this inner product , we have for any @xmath93 :    @xmath94 @xmath95 , v > \\ ] ] implementing the k - j boundary conditions and the coupling : @xmath96>_{\\omega } + < { \\partial_{\\nu}}\\phi , \\psi > _ { { \\mathbb{r}^2}\\backslash   \\omega}\\ ] ] yields @xmath97 for any @xmath98 .",
    "+      we must verify that @xmath99 for some @xmath100 .",
    "we will take the system with @xmath101 first for simplicity .",

    "as we are in the subsonic case , @xmath106 , the above problem is strongly elliptic .",
    "let us now solve for @xmath107 .",
    "we differentiate the flow relations above and the first boundary condition in @xmath26 , and combine the flow equations to arrive at the elliptic problem @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "this is a mixed ( zaremba ) elliptic problem @xcite .",
    "we recall , with @xmath110 , where @xmath11 is a bounded and smooth domain , the solution to @xmath111 enjoys the regularity @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "thus the maximal spatial regularity possess @xmath114 derivatives .",
    "the above result is almost optimal , since it is known that in general when @xmath115 and @xmath116 do not meet at an appropriate acute angle , one has that @xmath117 for all @xmath118 ; on the other hand @xmath119 ( where @xmath120 is the appropriately defined besov space on @xmath11 ) .",
    "an application of the above result with @xmath121 yields the solution @xmath122 returning to the equation , we recover @xmath50 : @xmath123 and hence , @xmath124 . with @xmath125 in hand ( and hence @xmath126 \\in h^{1/2}(\\omega)$ ] ) , solving for @xmath127 is standard .",
    "in addition , having solved for @xmath128 , we may then specify that @xmath129 , with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we must verify that this is valid by recovering @xmath18 .",
    "note that ( from the regularity of the flow equations and mixed boundary conditions ) we _ will not obtain _",
    "@xmath130 , demonstrating that the resolvent operator , in this case , is not compact .    to see that @xmath131 , we proceed as follows : let @xmath132 and consider the equation for @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is a solution ( as obtained above for the case @xmath135 ) : @xmath136 + \\lambda v   = g_2 \\in l_2({{\\omega}})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] applying @xmath137 to both sides of first equation , multiplying by @xmath138 , and integrating gives",

    "moreover , @xmath145 for all @xmath146 , and so @xmath147 finally , taking @xmath148 sufficiently large , we have the final a priori estimate on the solution : @xmath149    in addition , we note from the proof of the m - dissipativity of @xmath73 above , that @xmath150 is also m - dissipative ; indeed , @xmath151 .",

    "the following proposition allows us to incorporate the above nonlinearities into our theory of well - posedness as in @xcite . for this reason we do not elaborate further on the nonlinear analysis , as the key issues arising in the study of this model which stand apart from the aforementioned analyses occur in the _ linear theory_.    [ abstractnonlin ] for each of the nonlinearities @xmath479 above",
    ", we have that @xmath479 is locally lipschitz from @xmath483 into @xmath484 and there exists @xmath485-functional @xmath486 on @xmath483 such that @xmath479 is a frchet derivative of @xmath486 , @xmath487 .",

    "to do so , we have taken clamped plate boundary conditions . however , in recent discussions with e. dowell ( duke ) @xcite , the authors have come to understand that the _ free - clamped _",
    "configuration represents a model of great recent interest . in addition , it is perhaps the most mathematically interesting ( and difficult ) case corresponding to this class of flow - plate models .",
    "these configurations are extremely important in the modeling of airfoils and in the modeling of panels in which some component of the boundary is left free .",
    "in addition to k - j condition , one must contend with the difficulties associated with the free plate boundary condition .",
    "the applicability of k - j boundary condition is highly dependent upon the geometry of the plate in question .",
    "the configuration below represents an attempt to model oscillations of a plate which is _ mostly free_. the dynamic nature of the flow conditions correspond to the fact that the interaction of the plate and flow is no longer static along the free edge(s ) , and in this case the implementation of the k - j condition is called for .",
    "this yields the following boundary conditions for the flow - plate system : @xmath491 where @xmath492 and we have partitioned the boundary @xmath493 . the boundary operators @xmath494 and @xmath495 are given by @xcite : @xmath496\\,=\\partial_{\\tau}\\partial_{\\nu}\\partial_{\\tau}u,\\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath497 is the outer normal to @xmath498 , @xmath499 is the unit tangent vector along @xmath500 .",

    "the regions are described by the picture below .",
    "the configuration above arises in the study of airfoils , but another related configuration referred to as _ axial flow _ takes the flow to occur in the @xmath319 direction in the picture above . in our analysis ,",
    "the geometry of the plate ( and hence the orientation of the flow ) do not play a central role . in practice",
    ", the orientation can have a dramatic effect on the occurrence and magnitude of the oscillations associated with the flow - structure coupling . in the case of axial flow ,",
    "the above configuration is often discussed in the context of _ flag flutter _ or flapping .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "the physical nature of the models given by the boundary conditions in makes their analysis desirable ; however , such models involve a high degree of mathematical complexity due to the dynamic and mixed nature of the boundary coupling near the flow - plate interface . from the point of view of the existing analysis ,",
    "much of the well - posedness and long - time behavior analysis is contingent upon taking clamped boundary conditions assumed for the plate ; these allow for smooth extensions to @xmath504 of the neumann flow boundary conditions satisfied by the flow . in the absence of these",
    ", one needs to approximate the original dynamics in order to construct sufficiently smooth functions amenable to pde calculations .",
    "this is a technical challenge and was carried out in a similar fashion in @xcite , although the need for this analysis was not due to plate boundary conditions .",
