    "a _ maximal _ surface in a @xmath4dimensional lorentzian manifold is a spacelike surface with zero mean curvature . here by _",
    "spacelike _ we mean that the induced metric from the ambient lorentzian metric is a riemannian metric on the surface .",
    "the mathematical interest of maximal surfaces resides in the fact that they locally maximize area among all nearby surfaces having the same boundary @xcite .",
    "furthermore , maximal surfaces and , more generally spacelike surfaces with constant mean curvature , have also a great importance in general relativity @xcite .",
    "parabolicity is a concept that lies in the borderline between several branches of mathematics , such as riemannian geometry , stochastic analysis , partial differential equations and potential theory .",
    "let us recall that a riemannian surface @xmath5 with non - empty boundary , @xmath6 , is said to be _ parabolic _ if every bounded harmonic function on @xmath7 is determined by its boundary values .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the parabolicity of @xmath7 is equivalent to the existence of a proper nonnegative superharmonic function on @xmath7 ( see beginning of section  [ s3 ] ; for details see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "classically , a riemannian surface without boundary is called parabolic if it does not admit a nonconstant negative subharmonic function .",
    "in fact , in @xcite we considered that definition of parabolicity .",
    "however , along this work we will reserve the term _ parabolicity _ for riemannian surfaces with non - empty boundary , and we will use the term _ recurrence _ for riemannian surfaces without boundary . a riemannian surface @xmath5 without boundary is called _ recurrent _ if for every nonempty open set @xmath8 with smooth boundary , @xmath9 is parabolic ( as a surface with boundary ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the concept of recurrence is equivalent to the classical concept of parabolicity ( for surfaces without boundary ) .",
    "this follows from the observation that a riemannian manifold without boundary is recurrent precisely when almost all brownian paths are dense in the manifold ( for the details , see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) ) .    in @xcite fernndez and lpez",
    "have recently proved that properly immersed maximal surfaces with non - empty boundary in the lorentz - minkowski spacetime @xmath10 are parabolic if the lorentzian norm on the maximal surface in @xmath10 is eventually positive and proper ( see also section 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by that work , in this paper we study some parabolicity criteria for maximal surfaces immersed into a lorentzian product space of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is a connected riemannian surface and @xmath11 is endowed with the lorentzian metric @xmath12 here @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the projections from @xmath15 onto each factor , and @xmath16 is the riemannian metric on . for simplicity ,",
    "we will simply write @xmath17 and we will denote by @xmath18 the 3-dimensional product manifold @xmath11 endowed with that lorentzian metric . observe that in particular , when @xmath19 is the flat euclidean plane what we obtain is the well known @xmath20 lorentz - minkowski 3-dimensional spacetime .    a natural generalization of the lorentzian norm on a surface in @xmath10 to the lorentzian product  consists in considering the function @xmath21 where the function @xmath22 measures the distance on the factor @xmath23 to a fixed point @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the height function of the surface @xmath26 ( for the details , see section  [ s3 ] ) . in this context ,",
    "our main result is theorem [ teorlap ] which asserts that given a complete riemannian surface @xmath27 with non - negative gaussian curvature , then every maximal surface in  with non - empty boundary and such that the function @xmath28 is eventually positive and proper is parabolic . in particular , and as an application of this result , we deduce that every maximal graph over a starlike domain @xmath3 is parabolic .",
    "this allows us to give an alternative proof of the non - parametric version of our calabi - bernstein result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.3 and corollary 4.4 ) for maximal entire graphs in  ( see corollary [ cb ] ) .",

    "a smooth immersion @xmath29 of a connected surface @xmath30 is said to be a spacelike surface if @xmath31 induces a riemannian metric on , which as usual is also denoted by @xmath32 . in that case , since @xmath33 is a unitary timelike vector field globally defined on the ambient spacetime @xmath34 , then there exists a unique unitary timelike normal field @xmath35 globally defined on which is in the same time - orientation as @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 we will refer to @xmath35 as the future - pointing gauss map of , and we will denote by @xmath38 $ ] the smooth function on  given by @xmath39 . observe that the function @xmath40 measures the hyperbolic angle @xmath41 between the future - pointing vector fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 along . indeed , they are related by @xmath42 .",

    "then the gauss and weingarten formulae for the spacelike surface  are given by [ eqgauss ] _",
    "xy=_xy - n and [ eqwein ] ax=-_xn , for every tangent vector fields @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath47 is the projection of  onto @xmath48 , that is , @xmath49 .",
    "observe that the gradient of @xmath14 on  is @xmath50 so that the gradient of @xmath51 on @xmath7 is @xmath52 throughout this paper , for a given vector field @xmath53 along the immersion , we will denote by @xmath54 its tangential component ; that is , @xmath55 in particular , @xmath56 and we easily get [ normgradh ] h^2=^2 - 1 , where @xmath57 denotes the norm of a vector field on . since @xmath36 is parallel on  we have that [ eqaux ] _ x _",

    "in particular , [ laph ] h=0 for every maximal surface in .    given any function @xmath62 , we can consider its lifting @xmath63 defined by @xmath64 in turn , we associate to @xmath65 the function @xmath66 given by @xmath67 . in this context , the laplacian on  of @xmath68 can be expressed in terms of the laplacian @xmath69 of @xmath70 and the differential operators of @xmath71 as follows .",

    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath96 , where @xmath32 stands for the riemannian metric on  induced from the lorentzian ambient space .",
