    "we report on a search for dark matter ( dm ) satellites via @xmath1-ray emission from weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) annihilation . specifically , we searched for satellites predicted by cosmological n - body simulations  @xcite but lacking counterparts in other wavelengths .",
    "we selected unassociated , high - galactic - latitude @xmath1-ray sources from both the first lat source catalog ( 1fgl )  @xcite and an independent list of source candidates created with looser assumptions on the source spectrum . using the likelihood ratio test ,",
    "we distinguished extended sources from point sources and wimp annihilation spectra from conventional power - law spectra .",
    "no candidates were found in either the unassociated 1fgl sources or our additional list of candidate sources .",
    "this null detection is combined with the via lactea ii ( vl - ii )  @xcite and aquarius  @xcite simulations to set an upper limit on the annihilation cross section for a @xmath2 wimp annihilating through the @xmath3channel .",
    "our data sample consisted of ` diffuse ' class events with energies between @xmath4 and @xmath5 from the first year of lat data collection ( 2008 august 8  2009 august 7 ) .",
    "we rejected events with zenith angles larger than 105@xmath6and events taken during time periods when the rocking angle of the lat was greater than 47@xmath6 .",
    "this analysis was limited to sources with galactic latitudes greater than 20@xmath6 , since the galactic diffuse emission complicates source detection and the analysis of spatial extension at lower galactic latitudes .",
    "we modeled the diffuse @xmath1-ray emission with the standard galactic ( _ gll_iem_v02.fit _ ) and isotropic ( _ isotropic_iem_v02.txt _ ) background models . throughout this analysis",
    ", we used the lat sciencetools version v9r18p1 and the p6_v3_diffuse instrument response functions .",
    "the 1fgl contains 1451 high - energy @xmath1-ray sources , of which 806 are at high galactic latitude ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "of these high - latitude 1fgl sources , 231 are unassociated with sources at other wavelengths and constitute the majority of the sources that were examined as potential dm satellites . the 1fgl spectral analysis , including the threshold for source acceptance , assumed that sources were point - like with power - law spectra .",
    "this decreased the sensitivity of the 1fgl to both spatially extended and non - power - law sources , which are characteristics expected for dm satellites . to mitigate these biases , we augmented the unassociated sources in the 1fgl with an independent search of the high - latitude sky  @xcite .",
    "we searched for @xmath1-ray sources using the internal lat collaboration software package , ` sourcelike `  @xcite . `",
    "sourcelike`performs a fully binned likelihood fit in two dimensions of space and one dimension of energy . for spectral",
    "fitting , ` sourcelike`fits the number of counts associated with a source in each energy bin independently . the full likelihood is the product of the likelihoods in each bin .",
    "this calculation has more degrees of freedom than that performed by the lat sciencetool , ` gtlike ` , which calculates the likelihood from all energy bins simultaneously according to a user - supplied spectral model . in this analysis",
    ", we used 11 energy bins logarithmically spaced from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .    using ` sourcelike ` , we searched for sources in 2496 regions of interest ( rois ) of dimension @xmath8 centered on healpix  @xcite pixels obtained from an order 4 tessellation of the high - latitude sky ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "each roi was sub - divided into @xmath10 pixels , and for each pixel the likelihood of a point source at that location was evaluated by comparing the maximum likelihood ( @xmath11 ) of two hypotheses : ( 1 ) that the data were described by the standard lat diffuse background models without any point sources ( @xmath12 ) , and ( 2 ) that the data were described by the existing model with an additional free parameter corresponding to the flux of a source at the target location ( @xmath13 ) . utilizing the likelihood ratio test , we defined a test statistic , @xmath14 .    after creating a map of @xmath15over the high - latitude sky , candidate sources with @xmath16 were iteratively refit incorporating the normalizations of diffuse backgrounds and neighboring point sources as free parameters .",
    "after refitting , source candidates with @xmath17 background fluctuations are detected at @xmath18 when fit with ` sourcelike ` .",
    "] were accepted for study . finally , to avoid duplicating 1fgl sources , we removed candidate sources with 68% localization errors overlapping the 95% error ellipse given in the 1fgl .",
    "our search of the high - latitude sky revealed 710 candidate sources , of which 154 are not in the 1fgl ( 36 of these candidate sources were subsequently included in the second lat source catalog ( 2fgl )  @xcite ) .",
    "we did not expect to recover all of the 806 high - latitude 1fgl sources , since the 1fgl is a union of four different detection methods and external seeds from the bzcat and wmap catalogs  @xcite .",
    "however , since ` sourcelike`fits each energy bin independently , we expected to find source candidates that were not included in the 1fgl , either because they had non - power - law spectra or they had hard spectra with too few photons to pass the 1fgl spectral analysis .",
    "we sacrificed some sample purity for detection efficiency in our candidate source list because stringent cuts on spatial extent and spectral shape were later applied .",
    "we obtained a final list of 385 high - latitude unassociated lat sources and source candidates by combining 231 unassociated 1fgl sources with 154 non-1fgl candidate sources .",
    "to check for consistency with the source analysis of the 1fgl , we performed an unbinned likelihood analysis with ` gtlike`assuming that the unassociated sources were point - like with power - law spectra .",
    "our fitted fluxes and spectral indices are in good agreement with those in the 1fgl for the 231 unassociated 1fgl sources",
    ". the wide range of fluxes and spectral indices spanned by the unassociated lat sources can be seen in figure  [ fig : image1 ] .",
    "it is apparent that there are more non-1fgl source candidates in this sample with very hard spectra ( spectral index @xmath19 ) and very low fluxes ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we find that these source candidates are very likely spurious  @xcite .",
    "to @xmath5 for the 385 high - latitude unassociated sources and source candidates .",
    "the squares are the 231 unassociated sources from the 1fgl , while the triangles are the 154 additional source candidates detected with ` sourcelike ` .",
    "the stars are the 10 representative power - law models in table  [ tab : tests ] . ]",
    "the @xmath1-ray flux from wimp annihilation in a satellite can be expressed as @xmath21 here , @xmath22 represents the line - of - sight integral through the dm density at an offset angle @xmath23 ( relative to the center of the satellite ) , while @xmath24 is an energy - dependent particle physics factor including the velocity - averaged annihilation cross section @xmath25(see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "while the majority of dm satellites in current simulations are not spatially resolvable by the lat , spatial extension is an important feature for distinguishing large or nearby satellites from point - like astrophysical sources . assuming that the dm distribution of a satellite follows an nfw profile  @xcite with scale radius @xmath26 at a distance @xmath27 , the angular extent of the satellite can be characterized by the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "approximately @xmath29 of the integrated @xmath30-factor comes from within the angular radius @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "we used the likelihood ratio test , as implemented by ` sourcelike ` , to test sources for spatial extension .",
    "we defined a test statistic for extension as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the test statistic of the candidate source assuming that it has negligible extension ( @xmath31 much smaller than the lat psf ) and @xmath34 is the test statistic of the candidate source when @xmath31 is fit as a free parameter . in both cases ,",
    "the position of the source was optimized during the fit .",
    "additionally , we defined a test statistic to select sources with @xmath1-ray spectra consistent with wimp annihilation into @xmath3(chosen as a representative proxy for tree - level annihilation spectra ) .",
    "this spectral test statistic , @xmath35 , is the difference in source @xmath15calculated with an unbinned analysis using ` gtlike`assuming a @xmath3spectral model ( @xmath36 ) and a power - law ( @xmath37 ) spectral model . when performing our fit , we modeled the candidate source as point - like  @xcite .",
    "] and left its flux and the flux of the diffuse backgrounds free .",
    "in addition to the flux , each spectral model contained an additional free parameter ( the dm mass or spectral index ) .",
    "we defined cuts to independently eliminate 99% of point sources and 99% of power - law sources , labelled @xmath38 and @xmath38 respectively . to evaluate these cuts over the pertinent range of source fluxes and spectral indices",
    ", we bracketed the unassociated lat sources with 10 representative power - law models ( table  [ tab : tests ] and blue stars in figure  [ fig : image1 ] ) .",
    "for each of these 10 models , we simulated 1000 independent sources at random locations in the high - latitude sky using the lat simulation tool , ` gtobssim ` , and the spacecraft pointing history for our one - year data set . to accurately incorporate imperfect modeling of background point and diffuse sources",
    ", we embedded the simulated point sources in the lat data and calculated @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we defined @xmath38 and @xmath41 for each representative model as the smallest value of @xmath39 or @xmath40 that was larger than that calculated for 99% of simulated power - law point sources .",
    "the values of @xmath38 and @xmath41 ( table  [ tab : tests ] ) were calculated independently of each other and the @xmath17 detection cut .",
    "we used a bilinear interpolation of table  [ tab : tests ] to estimate the value of @xmath38 and @xmath41 for any point in the space spanned by the grid of flux and spectral index .",
    "these tests of spatial extension and spectral character allow us to select non - point - like and non - power - law sources with a contamination of 1 in @xmath42 assuming they are independent .",
    "realizations of the galactic dm satellite population were created by selecting 6 maximally separated vantage points 8.5 kpc from the center of the vl - ii simulation and each of the 6 aquarius simulations . for each of the @xmath44 `` visualizations '' of vl - ii and aquarius , we calculated the @xmath1-ray fluxes of all satellites for a given @xmath25using eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : flux ] ) . with these fluxes and the true spatial extension for each satellite",
    ", we performed a bilinear interpolation on table  [ tab : bbbar ] to determine the detection efficiency for each satellite .",
    "the probability that the lat would observe none of the satellites in visualization @xmath45 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the detection efficiency for satellite @xmath48 in visualization @xmath45 . because there is no reason to favor any one visualization",
    ", we calculated the average null detection probability over the @xmath49 visualizations as @xmath50 to set an upper limit on the dm annihilation cross section , we increased @xmath25until the probability of a null observation was @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to 95% probability that , for this @xmath25 , at least one satellite would have passed our selection criteria . using this methodology",
    ", the lat null detection constrains @xmath25to be less than @xmath53 for a @xmath2 wimp annihilating through the @xmath3channel .",
