    "there are several possibilities to characterize the excitation of _ undular bores _ and related phenomena @xcite : the very definition and observation of the wave - breaking phenomena in the presence of disorder and nonlinearity is an open issue .",
    "this calls for an extensive development of experimental techniques and the use of multiple methods to characterize the dsws .    in this paper",
    "we give a detailed review of our experimental investigations of the hydrodynamical regime in the generation of optical shocks during nonlinear optical propagation in a thermal defocusing nonlinearity of a continuous wave ( cw ) laser beam .",
    "the hydrodynamical regime is achieved when the nonlinear length is much smaller than the diffraction and losses ( absorption and scattering ) lengths .",
    "our experimental technique allows the direct observation of a propagating initially gaussian laser beam in a thermal nonlinear liquid with controllable disorder obtained by a colloidal dispersion with a low index of refraction contrast .",
    "we show that , by increasing the strength of the nonlinearity , shock formation is enhanced , while , on the other hand , the random scatterers limit and ultimately inhibit the wave - breaking phenomenon .",
    "we quantify such a competition by analyzing both the laser beam along the propagation direction and its far field distribution intensity : these allow the measurement of the relevant scaling laws that relate the shock position @xcite and the post - shock wave - vector spectrum with the input beam size , power , and the scale and strength of disorder @xcite .",
    "these observables , namely the shock formation point and the output wave - vector spectrum , exhibit a threshold and determine a phase diagram identifying parameter regions where the shock occurs .    the paper is organized as follows : first we briefly review the theoretical framework .",
    "we then illustrate the experimental setup and the characterization of the samples used in the experiments .",
    "we then review the results in three different sections , corresponding to the experimental characterization of different observables .",
    "we present the analysis of the beam intensity distribution both during propagation and exiting the samples .",
    "we conclude with a summary section of the obtained results .",
    "in our experiments , cw laser beams propagate in dye - doped dispersions of dielectric colloidal beads .",
    "the beam is partially absorbed and scattered , activating the interplay between thermal - defocusing and spatial - disorder .",
    "neglecting , in a first approximation , the spatial nonlocality @xcite , the refractive index perturbation in the presence of nonlinearity and disorder to the bulk index @xmath0 is written as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 takes into account the considered defocusing kerr effect , @xmath3 is the optical intensity and @xmath4 represents the random perturbation due to the colloidal beads .",
    "the propagation of a tem@xmath5 gaussian beam inside the medium is described by the paraxial wave equation for the complex envelope , @xmath6 , of a monochromatic electric field @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wave - vector , @xmath10 the velocity of light , and @xmath11 is the electric permittivity of free space . in eq .",

    ", we obtain the following dimensionless equation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , being @xmath20 and @xmath21 the diffraction length , and @xmath22 . the quantity @xmath23 measures the strength of the nonlinearity with respect to the diffraction : a small value for @xmath23 implies negligible diffraction and a pronounced nonlinear response .",
    "@xmath24 is the ratio between the perturbation of index due to the disorder and the nonlinearity .    setting in eq.([eq : dimensionless ] ) @xmath25 $ ] and retaining only the leading order in @xmath23 , we obtain the following equation for the phase @xmath26 : @xmath27    limiting to one dimension ( @xmath28d , @xmath29 ) , performing the transverse derivative of eq.([eq : decoupled ] ) , and defining a _ velocity field _ equal to the phase chirp , @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 in the homogeneous case ( @xmath32const . ) and for an ordered medium ( @xmath33 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hopf ] ) takes the form of the hopf equation @xcite , the solution of which can develop discontinuities in the velocity profile , @xmath34 , and hence gives rise to shock waves .",
    "here we remark that from the hydrodynamical approximation , a threshold in the nonlinearity is present : in fact , the approximation holds true when @xmath35 .",
    "another threshold arises from the term @xmath22 , corresponding to the existence of a critical value for the amount of randomness , above which it is expected that no shock occurs : when the random index perturbation @xmath4 becomes comparable with the nonlinearity @xmath36 , the material refractive index fluctuations are so pronounced that the nonlinear effect is totally masked .",
    "correspondingly , in our experiments ( see below ) in absence of disorder , we find a threshold in the laser power , while in the presence of disorder a threshold emerges also in the amount of randomness .",
    "in the hydrodynamic limit , dsws are expected to occur when the nonlinearity is dominant compared to diffraction ; nevertheless the diffraction , which is initially negligible , starts to play a major role in the proximity of the wave - breaking point , and regularizes the singularity by means of the appearance of characteristic oscillations ( undular bores ) .",
    "besides these regularizing oscillations , the singularity in the field phase and amplitude also results in a diffraction enhancement , evident in the funnel shape along the propagation direction ( see below ) appearing with the increase of the input power .",
