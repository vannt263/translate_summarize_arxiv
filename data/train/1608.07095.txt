    "we limit  nals to quasars with @xmath153 so that  emission lines can be available by the boss spectra .",
    "surveyed spectral region of  nals is between ly  @xmath4  and  emission lines , which constrains @xmath154 for  nals . and that of  nals is between ly  @xmath4  and  emission lines , which permits measurement of much higher @xmath5 values for  nals .",
    "in order to make a consistent comparison , we limit both  and  nals with @xmath155 . taking into account of @xmath153 and @xmath155 , there are 5922  nals and 3012  nals .",
    "we display the @xmath5 distributions of both  and  nals in figure [ fig8 ] .            in the calculation of @xmath5 ,",
    "we have made an assumption that all nals are produced by quasar self - absorptions .",
    "in fact , the catalogs contain absorptions from ( 1 ) the first population : cosmologically intervening galaxies ; ( 2 ) the second population : quasar host galaxies or galaxy clusters / groups that quasars reside in , which is often called as environmental absorptions ; and ( 3 ) the third population : quasar outflows .",
    "although ultra - fast outflows have been detected by many researchers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the vast majority of absorbers with a large @xmath5 belong to the first population .",
    "when absorbers fall into the second population , some absorbers move toward the observer and some away , and the @xmath5 would show a normal distribution centred at @xmath156 .",
    "in addition , galaxies around quasars are clustered / grouped , so one expects an excess of associated absorbers with respect to cosmologically intervening absorbers .",
    "absorbers of the third population move towards the observer , thus they have @xmath157 and are expected to destroy the normal distribution of @xmath5 of the second population absorptions .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] clearly shows that there are an abnormal excess in range of @xmath158 and a flat tail in range of @xmath159 .",
    "this suggests that the data in range of @xmath159 would be dominated by absorptions of the first population , and those in range of @xmath158 be mainly contributed from absorptions of the second and third populations .    in theory",
    ", quasar outflows do not affect the @xmath5 distribution of associated absorbers with @xmath160 . in figure [ fig8 ] , absorbers with @xmath161",
    "are probably contributed from cosmologically intervening absorptions .",

    "this results in gaussian components with @xmath164 for  nals and @xmath165 for  nals .",
    "the fitting results are plotted with color lines in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "it is clear that a combination of a gaussian and a linear functions can not well characterize the overall distributions , and the excesses located at @xmath166 are very remarkable with respect to fitting curves , which likely are the contribution of quasar outflows .",
    "since  ( 64.49 ev ) has much higher ionization potential than  ( 15.035 ev ) , we expect the associated  and  nals to show different statistical properties .",

    "the multi - component fittings overplotted with red lines imply that the dispersion of  environmental absorptions ( @xmath168 ) is much larger than the same value of  environmental absorptions ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "in addition , with respect to multi - component fittings , the excessive tail of  absorbers reaches a value of @xmath170 , but that of  absorbers can extend out to a higher value of @xmath171 .",

    "the radius of 300 kpc for survived  absorbers is much smaller than that of 800 kpc for survived  absorbers .",
    "this discrepancy is also clearly reflected by our multi - component fittings ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) : @xmath168 for  absorbers , and @xmath169 for  ones .    using the emission redshifts of the sdss pipeline",

    "we exclude quasars that the flux data at 1350  are not available by the boss spectra due to quasar redshifts and that are located at @xmath179 , and limit absorbers with @xmath174 .",
    "this results in a sample of 2866  nals .",

    "we find that both low- and high - luminosity quasars have similar median .",
    "thus , the differences reflected by figures [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] are not originated in the evolution of quasar surrounding gas .",
    "it is interesting that the high - luminosity quasars tend to show larger velocity ( @xmath5 )  nals with smaller absorption strengths , which might be related to the radiative acceleration by quasar luminosity and ionization condition of cgms around quasars . for high - luminosity quasars ,",
    "the enormous power of outflows and the energetic radiation from accretion disc could produce stronger feedback to surrounding gas of quasars .",
    "in this case , surrounding gas of high - luminosity quasars is possibly accelerated to higher velocity and photo - ionized to higher level .",
    "using the boss quasar spectra ( dr9q ) , combining the two early works ( papers i and ii ) , we have detected a total number of 41,479  nals with @xmath2@xmath3 in wavelength range between ly  @xmath4  and  emission lines .",

    "the associated systems show significant absorptions when compared to the intervening ones .",
    "the redshift density evolution shape of  absorbers is similar to the history of the cosmic star formation , which indicates that  absorbers may be connected to the star formation activities within galaxies .",

    "when compared with the low - luminosity quasars , high - luminosity quasars tend to have larger @xmath5 and weaker absorptions .",
    "the line number density of absorbers depends not only on their volume density , but on physical cross - section and ionizing background of absorbing clouds .",
    "one of our future works will investigate the properties of absorbers that intersect both sightlines of a quasar pair ( two close quasars on sky ) .",
    "this might provide a useful limit to the geometric cross - section of absorbing cloud .",
    "deep imaging / spectroscopy observations to this kind of absorbers might also provide useful information about absorption line formation by comparing absorption strength and profile of absorption lines and characteristics of galaxy halo , such as gas distribution , star formation rate , orientations of disc and outflow , and so on .",

    "<S> in this paper , we extend our works of papers i and ii @xcite , which are assigned to systematically survey  narrow absorption lines ( nals ) with @xmath0  on quasar spectra of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , to collect  nals with @xmath1  from blue to red wings of  emission lines . together with papers i and </S>",
    "<S> ii , we have collected a total number of 41,479  nals with @xmath2@xmath3 in surveyed spectral region redward of ly  @xmath4  until red wing of  emission line . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the stronger  nals tend to be the more saturated absorptions , and associated systems ( @xmath1 ) seem to have larger absorption strengths when compared to intervening ones ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift density evolution behavior of absorbers ( the number of absorbers per redshift path ) is similar to the history of the cosmic star formation . when compared to the quasar - frame velocity ( @xmath5 ) distribution of  absorbers , the @xmath5 distribution of  absorbers is broader at @xmath6 , shows longer extended tail , and exhibits a larger dispersion for environmental absorptions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for associated  absorbers , we find that low - luminosity quasars seem to exhibit smaller @xmath5 and stronger absorptions when compared to high - luminosity quasars .    </S>",
