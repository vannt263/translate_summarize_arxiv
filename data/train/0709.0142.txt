    "quantum operations , such as the application of a unitary rotation on a qubit or a projective measurement in some basis , require some form of reference frame . in most descriptions of quantum experiments , this reference frame is considered to be classical and therefore can be treated as non - dynamical and used repeatedly without disturbance .",
    "the situation is quite different for a quantum reference frame  measurements and interactions can cause an unknown disturbance on the quantum frame and , consequently , it can reduce the ability of that system to serve as a reference frame in subsequent uses  @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , an apparatus implementing a unitary rotation operation on a qubit .",
    "for concreteness , we consider this qubit to be spin-1/2 system ; however , it could equally well be the polarization state of a single photon , a two - level atom , etc .",
    "a standard apparatus uses a classical directional reference frame to define the axis about which the rotation occurs .",
    "now suppose that due to miniaturization , space constraints , or to improve the speed of the operation , the system that serves as the reference direction is not accurately described classically , but instead requires a quantum treatment using a hilbert space of finite size .",
    "the quantum operation describing the unitary rotation is then an operation _",
    "conditional _ on the state of the quantum reference frame .",
    "two effects will occur as a result of the quantum nature of the reference frame .",
    "first , this conditional operation will not be identical to the classical case due to the inherent uncertainty in the direction of the quantum reference frame .",
    "second , upon use , the state of the quantum reference frame may experience an unknown disturbance , essentially due to entanglement induced between the reference frame and system as a result of the interaction .",
    "it should be noted that the constraints that lead to the requirement that the reference system be treated quantumly are ones that are expected to arise in a quantum computing architecture .",
    "for example , measuring devices for such a system must couple strongly to specific registers ( subsystems ) , and this could imply a very small device .",
    "ideally , a measuring apparatus should be well - modeled classically , to reduce noise , however , that may not be compatible with the previous requirement .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider how a moderately sized system decoheres when being used in this way .",
    "this work is directly applicable to the magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) proposal of  @xcite . in that scheme a magnet on the scale of tens of nanometers in length",
    "is placed on tip of a nanomechanical resonator , which at very low temperatures may allow single - spin measurements in a solid state quantum computer . in this regime",
    "the assumption of classical behavior of the device leads to a poor approximation .",
    "similar problems would occur in situations in which hamiltonians must be applied to specific subsystems without disturbing neighboring ones .",
    "we now formally define the scenario that we are considering .",
    "let @xmath2 be the initial state of the quantum reference frame .",
    "let @xmath3 be the state of a reservoir composed of @xmath4 ordered subsystems on which we will sequentially perform operations using the same quantum reference frame .",
    "using the first subsystem , we apply a quantum operation @xmath5 on the joint system @xmath6 .",
    "we require that the map @xmath5 is _ rotationally invariant _ , meaning that it is independent of any specific direction in space .",
    "formally , a map @xmath5 is rotationally invariant if and only if @xmath7 = r(\\omega ) \\chi(\\cdot)r(\\omega)^\\dag$ ] for any rotation @xmath8 ( or more generally @xmath0 if half - integral spins are considered ) of the joint system .",
    "( here , @xmath9 is the unitary representation of the rotation group @xmath10 on the joint system . )",
    "subsequent to the operation , the reduced state of quantum reference frame is @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 denotes the partial trace over the @xmath13 subsystem of the reservoir .",
    "the first subsystem of the reservoir is then discarded , and the same operation is performed on the second subsystem , but using the updated quantum reference frame @xmath14 .",
    "we repeat these steps with the following subsystems of the reservoir , always using the updated quantum reference frame .",
    "the state of the quantum reference frame after the @xmath13 step is recursively @xmath15 $ ] . by discarding the previous subsystems of the reservoir at every step , we assume that the reservoir can not be used to increase our knowledge about the quantum reference frame .",
    "we wish to define a measure of the quality of the quantum reference frame , and to study how it decreases with the number of times the reference frame is used . defining the quality of a quantum reference can be quite arbitrary and depends on the interests of the experimentalist and on the task at hand . in this paper",
    ", we use the term _ quality function _ for any function @xmath16 that is meant to quantify the ability of the reference frame to perform a particular task .",
    "we will set general conditions on such functions , and analyze how such functions evolve with the number of uses of the quantum reference frame .",
    "we will also analyze the _ longevity _ of the quantum reference frame , that is , the number of times it can be used to perform a certain task before its quality falls below a certain threshold .    as in  @xcite , a quantum directional reference frame could be used to measure whether a series of spin-@xmath17 particles are parallel or anti - parallel to some classical arrow .",
    "( see figure  [ directionsfig ] .",
    ") however , there are a myriad of other possible cases , including measuring the angular momentum of a series of spin-@xmath18 systems with @xmath19 , or using the quantum reference spin to indicate an axis about which a unitary rotation operation is performed",
    ".     particles in the completely mixed state by means of a projection onto the @xmath20 or @xmath21 subspaces.,width=336 ]    in this paper , we generalize the results of refs .",
    "@xcite in three different ways .",
    "first , we consider performing operations on a reservoir of _ qudits _ ( quantum systems with @xmath22-dimensional hilbert spaces ) instead of restricting to the case of qubits ( @xmath23 ) as in  @xcite .",
    "second , we consider all possible rotationally - invariant quantum operations on the reference frame and the system , while the analyses in  @xcite were restricted to very particular kind of interaction ( specifically , interactions describing measurements ) .",
    "note that this joint quantum operation could be a measurement , a conditional unitary , or any other completely - positive map , provided that it is rotationally invariant .",
    "third , we generalize the concept of the quality function , and place general conditions on its form and evolution . in  @xcite , only a particular kind of quality function was considered ",
    "one which was based on the average probability of a correct measurement given a known spin direction  while now we are interested in any possible quality function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : momentsii ] , we introduce a set of parameters for describing a quantum reference frame , which we call _ moments _ , and demonstrate that any quality function must depend only on these moments .",
    "we then present the key result , theorem  [ th1 ] , which provides a classification of all rotationally - invariant maps .",
    "we give some recursive equations describing the evolution of the moments ( theorem  [ th2 ] ) . in section  [ sec : paramsandscaling ] , we discuss the longevity of a quantum reference frame for a general quality function under the repetitive application of a rotationally - invariant map , by analyzing the dependance of the evolution of its moments . section  [ sec : examples ] is dedicated to a pair of examples intended to illustrate the power of the techniques developed in the earlier sections of the paper . we explore the specific cases of measuring spin-@xmath24 particles relative to a quantum reference frame , as well as the use of a reference frame to perform pauli operations on qubits .",
    "we conclude with some general comments in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a classical reference frame is a local convention for describing the state of a system .",
    "a quantum reference frame is a quantum system that carries information about a classical reference frame .",
    "we define a quantum directional reference system as one which is correlated with a classical direction in space represented by the vector @xmath25 .",
    "the quantum system that indicates the direction of our reference axis is taken to be a spin-@xmath1 system , which has dimension @xmath26 .",
    "as in  @xcite , we consider an arbitrary initial state @xmath27 for the spin-@xmath1 quantum directional reference frame .",
    "( that is , the quantum reference frame transforms under rotations according to the spin-@xmath1 representation . )",
    "if we additionally assume that the initial quantum reference frame depends _ only _ on the vector @xmath25 , we deduce a symmetry condition : if @xmath28 is the spin-@xmath1 unitary representation of the rotation @xmath29 that transforms @xmath25 to @xmath30 , then @xmath31 .",
    "that is , the set of possible initial states @xmath32 is in one - to - one correspondence with the set of directions @xmath25 .    because a vector @xmath25 has an invariance group",
    " the group of rotations about this axis  the symmetry condition implies that the state of the quantum directional reference frame is also invariant under rotations about the @xmath25-axis .",
    "this in turn ensures that @xmath33 commutes with the angular momentum operator @xmath34 in the @xmath25-direction , and thus @xmath33 is diagonal in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath34 .",
    "we now consider how the state of the quantum reference frame is updated through its use in repeated rotationally - invariant operations @xmath5 which act on both the frame and the reservoir .",
    "we assume as in  @xcite that the reservoir initiates in a state that is invariant under rotations .",
    "( the completely mixed state is one example of such a state , but there exist other non - trivial states ) .",
    "that do not preserve angular momentum and to reservoirs that are not polarized in the direction of the quantum reference or only composed of spin-@xmath35 particles is a challenging problem .",
    "we hope that the framework we provide here will be useful in extending our results to this general situation . ]",
    "the assumptions that the initial state of the reservoir and the joint quantum operation are spatially invariant imply that the map @xmath36 used to update the state of the quantum directional reference frame , @xmath37 $ ] , is also rotationally invariant .",
    "we denote the restricted map @xmath36 on the quantum directional reference the _ disturbance _ map .",
    "it describes the back - action on the reference which occurs as a result of the interaction .",
    "let @xmath38 be the rotation by an angle @xmath39 around the vector @xmath25 .",
    "suppose that a rotationally - invariant map @xmath36 is applied to density matrix @xmath40 that is diagonal in a basis given by the eigenvectors of @xmath34 . because @xmath41 then @xmath42 is also diagonal in the basis given by the eigenvectors of @xmath34 . as a result , the evolution of the quantum reference frame under the repeated application of the rotationally - invariant map @xmath36 can be described by @xmath43 equations , one for each of the eigenvalues of @xmath40 .",
    "a different set of parameters that are equivalent to the eigenvalues is the set of _ moments _ given by @xmath44\\   |\\   1 \\leqslant \\ell \\leqslant 2j   \\}.",
    "\\label{eq : moments}\\ ] ] note that only @xmath45 moments are necessary because the sum of the eigenvalues must be one .",
    "the use of moments instead of eigenvalues will greatly simplify the analysis of the evolution of the quantum reference frame .",
    "the main motivation for studying the moments of the quantum reference frame is that any quality function @xmath16 will depends only on these moments .",
    "consequently , the behavior of the different moments will determine the behavior of the different quality functions . to see why @xmath16 depends only on the moments given by equation  [ eq : moments ]",
    ", we first remark that any reasonable form of @xmath16 depends only on the state of the quantum reference , but that it must respect the relation @xmath46 for all rotations @xmath29 and state @xmath40 diagonal in the basis composed of the eigenvectors of @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , the quality measure should not be biased such that it favors a quantum reference frame that is pointed in any particular direction relative to some external frame .",
    "all directions must be equally valid .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 does not depend on the direction of @xmath25 , but only on the eigenvalues or the moments of @xmath40 .",
    "note that the set of moments with respect to the direction @xmath25 can be written as a function of the moments with respect to any other direction  this is simply a change of basis .",
    "recall that @xmath47 as the state of the quantum reference frame after the @xmath48 joint operation with a subsystem of the reservoir , and @xmath49 as the initial state of the quantum reference frame . by our previous arguments , for a given state @xmath3 of the reservoir and joint quantum operation @xmath5 , the moments of @xmath47 must be explicit linear functions of the moments of @xmath50 .",
    "these results lead us to the general recursion relation , @xmath51 = \\sum_{i=0}^{2j } a_{i}^{(\\ell ) } { \\text{tr}}[\\rho_j^{(k-1 ) } j_{\\hat{n}}^{i } ] ,    \\label{eq : rec}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are real coefficients .",
    "we now present a theorem which provides a classification of the different rotationally - invariant maps in terms of lie algebra generators .",
    "the important question of how to obtain noiseless subsystems for quantum channels constructed from generators of a lie algebra has been first studied in @xcite , and various proprieties of lie algebra channels were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those works , we restrict our attention to @xmath0 .",
    "first , some notation .",
    "let @xmath53 for @xmath54 be the angular momentum operators for some arbitrary cartesian frame . on a spin-@xmath1 system ,",
    "define the map @xmath55 for @xmath40 a density matrix of the spin-@xmath1 system .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the @xmath4-fold composition of @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and define @xmath59 .",
    "any map @xmath36 which is invariant with respect to a spin-@xmath1 irreducible representation of @xmath0 has the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 are real coefficients .",
    "[ th1 ]    the proof is provided in appendix  [ app : proof ] .",
    "theorem  [ th1 ] allows us an immediate simplification by restricting the number of coefficients @xmath52 of equation  ( [ eq : rec ] ) that are required to calculate the evolution of the reference state .",
    "the following theorem limits the number of coefficients ( @xmath62 ) which determine the evolution of the @xmath34-moments of a spin-@xmath1 under the action of a general invariant channel , and can be very useful to study the behavior of moments with low degree :    if @xmath63 is even , then @xmath64 = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\ell/2 } a_{2i}^{(\\ell ) } { \\rm tr}[\\rho_j^{(k-1 ) } j_{\\hat{n}}^{2i } ]    \\label{eq : even}\\ ] ] and if @xmath63 is odd , then @xmath64 = \\sum_{i=1}^{(\\ell+1)/2 } a_{2i -1}^{(\\ell ) } { \\rm tr}[\\rho_j^{(k-1 ) } j_{\\hat{n}}^{2k - 1 } ] .",

    "consider any rotationally - invariant map @xmath36 . by theorem  [ th1 ] ,",
    "we can write @xmath66 where the coefficients @xmath67 are real numbers and @xmath57 is given by equation  ( [ eq : zetamap ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath68= { \\text{tr}}[\\rho_j \\xi(j_z^\\ell ) ] = \\sum_{n=0}^{2j } q_n { \\text{tr}}[\\rho_j \\zeta ^{\\circ n}(j_z^\\ell)].\\ ] ] to prove our theorem , it is sufficient to show that @xmath69 is a polynomial in @xmath70 of degree @xmath63 , but where all the powers have the same parity as @xmath63 .",
    "define @xmath71 and define the function @xmath72 using the commutation relations @xmath73 = i\\epsilon_{a , b , c } j_c$ ] , we can show that @xmath74 and @xmath75 by induction , it is easy to prove using those relations that @xmath76 is a polynomial in @xmath70 of degree @xmath63 where all the powers have the same parity as @xmath63 .",

    "this concludes our proof .",
    "suppose we have a microscopic device for performing an operation or measurement on a quantum spin using a quantum reference frame . ultimately , after many uses , the quantum reference frame will need to be reinitialized . however , we wish to make as many uses of it as possible before performing this reinitialization , without allowing the accuracy to fall below some allowed threshold . to define this accuracy",
    "we will pick some quality function that is suited to our particular purpose . recall that any quality function @xmath16 will depend only on the moments of the @xmath34 operator .    as in  @xcite ,",
    "we are interested in the scaling , with respect to hilbert space dimension , of how many times a quantum reference frame can be used before the value of its quality function falls below a certain threshold .",
    "we refer to this property as the _ longevity _ of a quantum reference frame .",
    "there are three important features of our analysis to highlight .",
    "first , whereas the work of  @xcite restricts attention to one particular quality function , we will investigate the behavior of arbitrary functions satisfying the invariance relation described in sec .",
    "[ sec : momentsii ] .",
    "because we consider any such function , the longevity of the reference frame can be arbitrary .",
    "however , we are able to prove some general statements about the decay of the moments , and relationships amongst them , and these results can then be used to infer the behavior of any particular quality function .",
    "second , rather than considering only a particular state of the reference frame ( in  @xcite , they considered the state @xmath80 because it was optimal for the task at hand ) , we consider an arbitrary state .",
    "as such , the initial state @xmath49 of the quantum reference frame , as specified by its moments , can depend on @xmath1 in a quite arbitrary way . finally , we consider arbitrary rotationally - invariant joint quantum operations @xmath5 . in  @xcite",
    ", @xmath5 was chosen to describe a particular measurement that was optimal for some task . the resulting disturbance map that they considered is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is given by equation  ( [ eq : zetamap ] ) .",
    "this covariant map was also analyzed in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the number of times a reference frame can be used before its quality function ( which in their case depends only of the first moment ) falls below a certain threshold value scales by a factor @xmath83 .    in the following ,",
    "we prove a general theorem about the longevity of quantum reference frames .",
    "we start with theorem  [ th1 ] , which states that any rotationally - invariant disturbance map can be written as @xmath84 .",
    "however , as we now show , if the range and values of the coefficients @xmath85 can depend on @xmath1 arbitrarily , it is impossible to make any general statements about the longevity .",
    "we identify some natural assumptions for the coefficients , which then allow us to present a general theorem .",
    "first , in general , the number of parameters @xmath85 describing a map increases with @xmath1 ; i.e. , there are @xmath43 parameters which can be significant to the evolution . as an example , consider the complete depolarization map @xmath86 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , for this map , all parameters @xmath85 for @xmath87 are nonzero .",
    "however , inspired by an argument in @xcite , consider a rotationally - invariant map @xmath88 that conserves angular momentum in the @xmath25 direction , meaning that @xmath89 where @xmath34 is the _ total _ angular momentum operator in the @xmath25 direction .",
    "the change of angular momentum of the quantum reference frame caused by such a disturbance map @xmath36 can not be higher than the change in angular momentum of the subsystem @xmath90 , which is in turn bounded by the subsystem s dimension @xmath22 . given that the map @xmath91 can not lower or increase the angular momentum in any direction by more then one unit , the disturbance map s coefficients therefore satisfy @xmath92 for all @xmath93 , where @xmath22 is the dimension of each subsystem @xmath90 of the reservoir .",
    "thus , if a rotationally - invariant map conserves angular momentum , then we can bound the number of non - zero coefficients @xmath85 in a way that is independent of @xmath1 .    second , if the parameters @xmath85 can depend on @xmath1 arbitrarily , then we would not be able to conclude anything about the longevity of the quantum reference frame . to understand this , consider the example @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a projection into the subspace of total angular momentum @xmath96 .",
    "this map conserves the total angular momentum of the joint system .",
    "the dependence of @xmath97 on @xmath1 will determine directly the rate of the decay of the moments in function of @xmath1 . because the dependence of @xmath97 can be arbitrary",
    ", then the rate of the decay of the moments can also be an arbitrary function of @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that , in order to make a statement about the longevity of the quantum reference frame , we need to assume more than a bound on the number of the @xmath85 parameters or that the rotationally - invariant map @xmath5 conserves angular momentum in the direction of @xmath25 . for the following theorem , we assume that each coefficient @xmath85 converges to a constant when @xmath98 .",
    "we also need to make an assumption about the rate of convergence : suppose that each @xmath85 can be written as a quotient of two polynomial in @xmath1 , such that the degree of the denominator is at least the degree of the numerator ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) .",
    "finally , we assume that the state @xmath100 has the propriety that @xmath101=o(j^{\\ell})$ ] .",
    "a sufficient condition for this to be true is that there exists a @xmath102 independent of @xmath1 such that @xmath103 .",
    "( we note that these assumptions are motivated by examples , which we explore in the following section . )",
    "consider a quantum reference frame , realised as a spin-@xmath1 system with initial state @xmath100 , which is used for performing a rotationally - invariant joint operation @xmath5 .",
    "if this operation induces a disturbance map @xmath104 that satisfies the following assumptions :    1 .",

    "@xmath99 , 3 .",
