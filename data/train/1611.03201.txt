    "hadronic light - cone distribution amplitudes  ( das ) have been known to play an essential role in the qcd description of hard exclusive processes via the factorization theorem  @xcite .",
    "taking the transverse separation to zero , the factorization takes the form of a convolution of a perturbatively calculable hard - scattering amplitude and the process - independent nonperturbative das . these nonperturbative das motivated many theoretical studies to calculate meson das using nonperturbative methods such as the qcd sum rule  @xcite , the chiral - quark model from the instanton vacuum  @xcite , the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) approach  @xcite , and the light - front quark model  ( lfqm )  @xcite . among them",
    ", the lfqm appears to be one of the most efficient and effective tools in studying hadron physics as it takes advantage of the distinguished features of the light - front dynamics ( lfd )  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation of lfd , namely @xmath4 , yields the sign correlation between the light - front ( lf ) energy @xmath5 and the lf longitudinal momentum @xmath6 and leads to the suppression of vacuum fluctuations in lfd .",
    "this simplification is a remarkable advantage in lfd and facilitates the partonic interpretation of the amplitudes .",
    "based on the advantage of lfd , the lfqm has been quite successful in describing various static and non - static properties of hadrons such as meson mass spectra  @xcite , the decay constants  @xcite , electromagnetic and weak transition form factors  @xcite and generalized parton distribution amplitudes  ( gpds )  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have analyzed twist-2 das of pseudoscalar  ( @xmath7 ) and vector  ( @xmath8 ) mesons using the lfqm  @xcite . in more recent works",
    "@xcite , we have extended our lfqm to analyze twist-3 pseudoscalar ( @xmath9 ) das of pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite and chirality - even twist-3 ( @xmath10 ) das of vector mesons  @xcite and discussed the link between the chiral symmetry of qcd and the numerical results of the lfqm .",
    "in particular , we have discussed a wave function dependence of the lf zero - mode  @xcite contributions to @xmath9 and @xmath10 not only for the exactly solvable manifestly covariant bethe - salpeter ( bs ) model but also for the more phenomenologically accessible realistic lfqm  @xcite using the standard lf ( slf ) approach .",
    "we also linked the covariant bs model to the standard lfqm providing the correspondence relation  @xcite between the two models .",
    "effectively , we prescribed a consistent substitution for the lf vertex function in the covariant bs model with the more phenomenologically accessible gaussian wave function provided by the lfqm analysis of meson mass  @xcite .",
    "the remarkable finding is that the zero - mode contribution as well as the instantaneous contribution revealed in the covariant bs model become absent in the lfqm . without involving the zero - mode and instantaneous contributions",
    ", our lfqm result of twist-3 das @xmath9 and @xmath10 provides the consistency with the chiral symmetry anticipated from qcd s conformal limit  @xcite .",
