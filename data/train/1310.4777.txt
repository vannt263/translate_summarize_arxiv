    "explosive user traffic increase in spite of scarce wireless frequency - time resources is one of the most challenging issues for the future cellular system design @xcite .",
    "lte broadcast , also known as evolved multimedia multicast broadcast service ( embms ) in the third generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) standards @xcite , is one promising way to resolve the problem by broadcasting common requests among users so that it can save frequency - time resources @xcite .",
    "the common user requests can be easily found in , for example , popular multimedia content or software updates in smart devices . by harnessing these overlapping requests of users ,",
    "lte broadcast enhances the total resource amount _ per cell_.",
    "this plays a complementary role to the prominent small cell deployment approach providing more resource amount _ per user _ by means of reducing cell sizes @xcite .    to implement this technique in practice , it is important to validate the existence of sufficiently large number of common requests . according to the investigation in @xcite ,",
    "discovering meaningful amount of common requests is viable even in youtube despite its providing a huge amount of video files .",
    "that is because most users request popular files ; for instance , 80% of user traffic may occur from the top 10 popular files . on the basis of this reason ,",
    "at&t and verizon wireless are planning to launch lte broadcast in early 2014 to broadcast sports events to their subscribers @xcite .",
    "the number of available common requests and its resultant saving amount of resources in cellular networks are investigated in @xcite , but it focuses on broadcast ( bc ) service while neglecting the effect of incumbent unicast ( uc ) service .",
    "joint optimization of the resource allocations to bc and uc are covered in @xcite in the perspectives of average throughput and spectral efficiency .",
    "the authors however restrict their scenarios to streaming multimedia services where data are packetized , which can not specify the content of data as well as the corresponding user demand of the files .",
    "leading from the preceding works , we propose a bc network framework being specifically aware of content and able to transmit generic files via either bc or uc service .",
    "the selection of the service depends on the following content characteristics : 1 ) file size , 2 ) delay tolerance , and 3 ) price discount on bc compared to uc .",
    "these characteristics are able to represent a content specified file in practice . for easier understanding ,",
    "let us consider a movie file as an example .",
    "it is likely to be large file sized , delay tolerable ( if initial playback buffer is saturated ) , and sensitive to the per - bit price of bc under usage - based pricing @xcite owing to its large file size .",
    "an update file of a user s favorite application in smart devices can be a different example , being likely to be small file sized , delay sensitive , and less price sensitive .",
    "furthermore , this study devises a policy that a base station ( bs ) solely carry out bc / uc service selection based on user demand prediction . corresponding to the policy , we maximize the network operator s revenue without user payoff degradation by jointly optimizing bc resource allocation , file scheduling , and pricing . to be more specific",
    ", the following summarizes the novelty of the proposed network framework .    * * bc / uc selection policy * : a novel bc / uc selection policy is proposed where a bs solely assigns one of the services for each user by comparing his expected payoffs of bc and uc if assigned , without degrading user payoff . * * bc resource allocation * : optimal bc frequency allocation amount is derived in a closed form , showing the allocation is linearly increased with the number of users in a cell , and inversely proportional to uc price .",
    "* * bc pricing * : optimal bc price is derived in a closed form , proving the price is determined proportionally to the number of users until bc frequency allocation uses up the entire resources . *",
    "* bc file scheduling * : optimal bc file order is derived in an operation - applicable form as well as a closed form for a suboptimal rule suggesting smaller sized and/or more delay tolerable files should be prioritized for bc .    as a consequence ,",
    "we are able to not only estimate revenue in a closed form , but also verify the revenue from the proposed network keeps increasing along with the number of users unlike the conventional uc only network where the revenue is saturated after exhausting entire frequency resources . considering 3gpp release 11 standards , we foresee up to @xmath0% increase in revenue for a single lte broadcast scenario and more than a @xmath1-fold increase for a multi - cell scenario .",
    "a single cellular bs simultaneously supports downlink uc and bc services with @xmath2 frequency bandwidth where bc files are slotted in a single queue .",
    "the bs serves @xmath3 number of mobile users who are uniformly distributed over the cell region .",
    "let the subscript @xmath4 indicate the @xmath4-th user for @xmath5 , and define @xmath6 s as the locations of users .",
    "user locations are assumed to be fixed during @xmath7 time slots , but change at interval of @xmath7 independent of their previous locations .",
    "let the subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent uc and bc hereafter , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively denote uc and bc usage prices per bit . in order to promote bc use",
    ", the network offers price discount on bc so that it can compensate longer delay of bc .",

    "let the subscript @xmath12 represent the @xmath12-th popular file for @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the number of all possible requests in a given region .",
    "assume user request pattern follows zipf s law ( truncated discrete power law ) as in youtube traffic @xcite .",
    "it implies the file @xmath12 requesting probability @xmath15 is given as @xmath16 where @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "note that larger @xmath19 indicates user requests are more concentrated around a set of popular files .",
    "the following example sequentially describes the bs s operation to serve a typical user @xmath4 requesting file @xmath12 .    1 .",
    "* common request examination * : by inspecting user requests , bs becomes aware of the file @xmath12 s size @xmath20 as well as the number of file @xmath12 requests @xmath21 .",
    "delay tolerance examination * : user @xmath4 marks his requesting priority of the file @xmath12 as in conventional peer - to - peer ( p2p ) services ( e.g. high / low ) . assuming bs has the full knowledge of users quality - of - experience ( qoe ) patterns , this priority information corresponds to delay threshold @xmath22 , allowable delay without degrading qoe .",
    "bc frequency allocation , pricing , and file scheduling * : by inspecting @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , bs allocates bc frequency amount @xmath23 , and sets bc price @xmath11 as well as optimizing bc file scheduling in a revenue maximizing order .",
    "* bc / uc selection * : meanwhile in 3 ) , bs assigns either bc or uc to user @xmath4 in order to maximize revenue without inflicting the user s payoff loss .",
    "note that the pricing scheme we consider is similar to time - dependent pricing @xcite in respect of its flattening user traffic effect by adjusting @xmath11 over time .",

    "bc average spectral efficiency is therefore not greater than the uc s .    to be more specific , as fig .",

    "after using up the entire uc resources , bs then assigns bc ; 2 .   if @xmath51 , bs resorts to assign uc in order to avoid payoff loss .",

    "the reason is there is no more available bc frequency since then , and thus revenue can not be increased by any operations of bs other than the increasing number of common requests due to @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior can be further justified by fig .",

    "for the purpose of the network operator s revenue maximization , the proposed framework jointly optimizes resource allocation , pricing , and file scheduling under a novel bc / uc selection policy .",
    "although a bs solely assigns bc or uc service without informing users of the possible selections , the proposed policy does not degrade but even enhance user payoff .",
    "in addition , this study provides closed form solutions that enables to understand the fundamental behavior of the proposed framework and give meaningful network design insights ; for instance , revenue gain scaling order becomes @xmath3 from @xmath77 as @xmath3 increases .",
