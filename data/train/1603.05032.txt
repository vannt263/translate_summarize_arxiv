    "we discuss models of directed polymer which have unbounded jumps introduced in @xcite .",
    "see  @xcite for the background and related works .",
    "the previous paper shows the following three results : ( i ) the continuity of the free energy with respect to inverse temperature and the appearance probability of obstacles ; ( ii ) the asymptotic of the free energy as the appearance probability of obstacles goes to 1 ; ( iii ) the continuity of the time constant of first passage percolation ( fpp ) related to the model . in this paper , we show concentration bounds for the ground state energy , which is nothing but the passage time , and the free energy . as applications ,",
    "we derive the so - called `` rate of convergence '' results and , based on them , we are able to remove the restriction left in @xcite on a parameter in ( i ) and also give an alternative proof of ( iii ) .",
    "in fact , a concentration bound for the lower tail for fpp is shown in @xcite , proposition 3.1 .",
    "however the upper tail is significantly more difficult as we need to control the maximum jump of the optimal path , see section  [ key ] below . in this paper , we succeed in controlling jumps not only of the optimal path but also of low energy paths in the directed polymer model . as a result",
    ", we can show the concentration for the passage time and the free energy .",
    "+ let @xmath0 be the random walk on @xmath1 starting from @xmath2 and with the transition probability @xmath3 where @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a function of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a positive constant determined as to be @xmath10 ( for the choice of @xmath11 , see remark [ choice ] below ) .",
    "the random environment is modelled by independent and identically distributed bernoulli random variables @xmath12 with parameter @xmath13 ; @xmath14 we introduce the hamiltonian @xmath15 and define the partition functions by @xmath16 \\textrm { for $ \\beta\\in{\\mathbb{r}}$ and }    z_n^{\\eta,-\\infty}=p(h_n^\\eta=0),\\ ] ] where @xmath17 $ ] denotes the expectation with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath19 is positive for @xmath20-almost every @xmath21 , since the random walk has unbounded jumps .",
    "an important quantity in this model is the so - called free energy defined by @xmath22 ,   \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose existence can be shown by using subadditive ergodic theorem . in  @xcite ,",
    "the continuity property and some asymptotic beahvior of the free energy were studied .",
    "next , we introduce first passage percolation models related to this directed polymer",
    ". denote the ( scaled ) points where @xmath23 by @xmath24 with the scaling factor @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this scaling is natural since @xmath27 converges as @xmath26 to the poisson point process @xmath28 on @xmath29 whose intensity is the product of the counting measure and lebesgue measure . with some abuse of notation we will frequently identify @xmath27 , and more generally any point measure , with its support . given a realization of @xmath27 , we define the minimum passage time from @xmath2 to @xmath30 by @xmath31 this is the directed version of the howard - newman s euclidean fpp model in @xcite .",
    "now , a direct application of the subadditive ergodic theorem shows that the limit @xmath32 exists @xmath20-almost surely and equals to @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the limit @xmath34 , so - called time constant , is non random .",
    "observe  also that definition ( [ eq : passtime ] ) makes perfect sense when @xmath35 , yielding a limit @xmath36 in ( [ mu_p ] ) .",
    "it is again shown in  @xcite that @xmath34 is continuous as @xmath37 .",
    "this fpp is related to the _ ground state at @xmath38 _ of the directed polymer introduced above .",
    "namely , @xmath39 furthermore , it is shown in  @xcite that as @xmath40 , the ground state gives dominant contribution to the free energy : @xmath41    as one sees above , the subadditive ergodic theorm is useful to show the existence of the free energy and the time constant .",
    "however , it prevent us from getting more information about them , such as the continuity . in this paper",
    ", we will use a method of concentration of measures to get the rate of convergence in   and   and derive the continuity results as a corollary .",
    "+ first , we shall present the results for fpp .",
    "the first result is the concentration of the passage time around the mean .",
    "[ conc;fpp ] for any @xmath42 there exist positive constants @xmath43,@xmath44 , and @xmath45 $ ] which are independent of @xmath13 and @xmath30 such that for any @xmath46 , @xmath47|>n^{\\frac{1}{2}+\\delta})<{}c_1\\exp\\{-c_2n^{\\lambda}\\}.\\label{con1;fpp}\\ ] ]    the next result is about the rate of convergence .",
    "it implies that the fluctuation exponent ( see @xcite ) is @xmath48 or less .",

    "since it is easy to check the usual subadditivity , we have . from and , we have .",
    "+       + the proof is almost the same as that for fpp , so we only mention the outline here . to prove theorem [ 21 ] , we again use the argument of zhang .",
