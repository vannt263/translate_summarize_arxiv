    "computing the scattering amplitudes of a quantum theory using its singular and analytic structure has a long history with many notable sucesses  @xcite .",
    "recently the five - point all - plus helicity amplitude has been computed in qcd : first the integrands were determined using the method of maximal cuts  @xcite and @xmath2-dimensional unitarity and then the integrals were evaluated yielding a compact analytic form  @xcite . in @xmath2-dimensional unitarity the cuts",
    "are computed in @xmath3 dimensions where , typically , the components of the cuts are considerably more complicated than in four dimensions . in",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that four - dimensional unitarity techniques  @xcite blended with a knowledge of the singular structure of the amplitude could reproduce this form in a straightforward way .",
    "the four - dimensional approach was also used to calculate the six - point amplitude  @xcite which was subsequently verified  @xcite .",
    "here we apply these techniques to gravity amplitudes with a particular emphasis on their ultra - violet ( uv ) behaviour . understanding the uv structure of quantum gravity necessitates studying the two - loop amplitude .",
    "t hooft and veltman  @xcite demonstrated the one - loop finiteness of on - shell amplitudes in quantum gravity by showing the available counterterms in four dimensions made no contribution to perturbative amplitudes .",
    "this cancellation does not persist to two loop and goroff and sagnotti  @xcite in a landmark calculation were able to compute a uv infinity of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the functional form generated by an @xmath1 counterterm . a feature of the computation was the appearance of sub - divergences which were cancelled diagram by diagram . in  @xcite this computation",
    "was revisited using evanescent operators which arise at one - loop to remove the sub - divergences in the four - point two - loop amplitude . for gravity",
    "coupled to various matter multiplets they found uv terms @xmath6 and noted that the coefficient of @xmath0 , @xmath7 , was more robust and simpler than @xmath8 . specifically , when coupled to @xmath9 ( non - propagating ) three form fields @xmath8 obtained a contribution proportional to @xmath9 but @xmath7 did not .",
    "additionally when coupled to scalars and vectors @xmath7 was simply proportional to the the difference between the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom . as was argued in ref  @xcite , the coefficient @xmath7 has physical content since after renormalisation the amplitude depends upon @xmath7 but not @xmath8 .",
    "in this article we explore and compute , up to rational terms , the four and five - point two - loop amplitude in quantum gravity where all the external gravitons have positive helicity .",
    "we use the techniques which have proven successful for the gluon amplitude : the amplitude is organised using a knowledge of its singularity structure , then four - dimensional unitarity is used to determine the logarithmic and dilogarithmic parts .",
    "since @xmath0 only appears in the combination @xmath10 we can extract the coefficient of @xmath0 using unitarity .",
    "we obtain the same coefficient of @xmath0 for the four - point amplitude as in ref .",
    "we also obtain the coefficient of @xmath0 for the five - point amplitude and show that this matches to the same @xmath1 counterterm .",

    "these arise in two - particle cuts and have the form of one - loop bubble integral functions , @xmath25 where @xmath26 are rational functions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .. for real momenta @xmath29 but for complex momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31 are independent  @xcite .",
    "we are using a spinor helicity formalism with the usual spinor products @xmath32 and @xmath33 . ]    the all - plus two - loop amplitude in qcd does not contain this term  @xcite . this give rise to @xmath34 and @xmath0 terms in the combination @xmath35 there may be other sources of @xmath22 terms not directly determined by unitarity .",
    "the function @xmath36 contains the remaining polylogarithms of the amplitude and @xmath37 contains the remaining rational terms . in dimensional",
    "regularisation the internal momenta lie in @xmath3 and it is really @xmath2-dimensional unitarity which should be used to reconstruct the amplitude .",
    "consequently , four dimensional unitarity is not sensitive to the rational terms , however it does give considerable simplification .",
    "the rational terms may be computed by complementary methods such as recursion .",
    "for the case of qcd , the rational terms for @xmath38 were computed by recursion starting from the four point amplitude .",
