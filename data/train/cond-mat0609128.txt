    "following the discovery of ferromagnetism in zinc - blende mn - based semiconducting compounds,@xcite a theory has been developed that describes correctly a number of properties of those materials.@xcite the theory , which is based on the zener model of ferromagnetism mediated by band carriers , takes into account the complex structure of the valence band of zinc - blende semiconductors _ via _ the @xmath2 method , and employs the molecular - field and virtual - crystal approximations to include the exchange interaction between the mn _ d _ electrons and the valence band holes.@xcite in particular , the magnetic moment of the hole carriers per unit volume , @xmath3 , has been calculated for a range of hole concentrations  @xmath4.@xcite the results,@xcite corroborated recently by an independent calculation,@xcite have shown that while a part of this magnetic moment can be attributed to spin polarization of the hole fermi liquid , the orbital magnetic moment of the holes has also to be taken into account . however , in order to reduce a differential multi - band landau equation to an algebraic one , it has been assumed in refs .   and   that two relevant luttinger parameters have the same value , @xmath5 . a quantitative error introduced but this approximation has been hard to estimate and , moreover , within such an approximation a significant warping of the valence band has been neglected .    motivated by the recent accurate magnetization measurements carried out by sawicki and co - workers@xcite and ferromagnetic resonance studies of liu _ et al._,@xcite both completed for high quality ( ga , mn)as",
    ", we have decided to develop theory of hole magnetization in carrier - controlled ferromagnetic semiconductors valid for the arbitrary values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "our results show that in the experimentally relevant range of hole concentrations the theoretical values of @xmath3 are much greater that those evaluated previously,@xcite which allows us for a better description of the experimental findings.@xcite furthermore , we find that the crystalline anisotropy of @xmath3 is practically negligible , so that the dipole interaction between the subsystems of mn and hole magnetic moments does not contribute to magnetic anisotropy of ( ga , mn)as .    the calculation proceeds by the determination of the partition function of the holes occupying the landau levels in in the presence of mn spontaneous magnetization @xmath8 , assumed to be parallel to the external magnetic field  @xmath9 .",
    "hole magnetization is then obtained by differentiating the gibbs thermodynamic potential with respect to  @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath5 , a significant amount of symbolic calculations involving trigonometric expressions is required , followed by an efficient numerical solution of a truncated infinite eigenvalue problem .",
    "this methodology allows us to calculate and examine hole magnetization for various crystallographic directions of the magnetic field and magnetization of the @xmath1-sublattice .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows : in section  ii we present the details of the valence band structure of a zinc - blende semiconductor ; in section  iii we discuss quantized motion of an electron in uniform magnetic field ; in section  iv we describe some technicalities of our algorithm ; in section  v we present our results , and finally in section  vi we present conclusions of our work .",

    "this requires applying to @xmath82 a unitary transformation @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a @xmath70 unitary matrix that implements a rotation from the crystal back to the `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' , `` 3 '' coordinate system , so that in the spherical case the resulting matrix does not depend on @xmath76 .",

    "great care must be undertaken because the set of selected eigenvalues does not have to be complete unless @xmath80 is large enough , _",
    "i.e_.  there may be some lacking eigenvalues in the range between the smallest and the largest eigenvalues selected .",
    "the minimal selected eigenvalue does not monotonically decrease with increasing  @xmath80 in such a case .",
