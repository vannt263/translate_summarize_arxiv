    "<S> instead , we use in this channel , _ for the first time _ , finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) , which exhibit a nice stability in the qcd continuum threshold @xmath0 , at which one can extract , with a good accuracy , the mass of the lowest resonance . </S>",
    "<S> including the @xmath1 condensate contributions in the ope , we obtain @xmath2 mev , and the corresponding residue @xmath3 gev@xmath4 , which favours the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and negative parity s - wave interpretation of the @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> however , our analysis indicates a degeneracy between the unmixed @xmath5 and @xmath8 @xmath9-wave states . in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath10-wave channel </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain , for the @xmath10-resonance , @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 gev@xmath13 , which we expect to be discovered experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> our results also suggest that some _ intuitive choices _ of the continuum threshold used in the lsr literature are inconsistent with the fesr results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a study of the @xmath14-@xmath15-@xmath16 coupling using a vertex sum rule shows that , for the @xmath5 , @xmath9-wave channel , the leading ope contributions only start to order @xmath17 in the chiral limit @xmath18 , indicating that the @xmath14 is very narrow . </S>"
