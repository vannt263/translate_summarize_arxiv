    "in the last two decades , the phenomenon of chaos synchronization has been extensively studied in coupled nonlinear dynamical systems from both theoretical and application perspectives due to its significance in diverse natural and man - made systems @xcite . in particular ,",
    "various types of synchronization , namely complete synchronization ( cs ) , phase synchronization ( ps ) , intermittent lag / anticipatory synchronizations and generalized synchronization ( gs ) have been identified in coupled systems .",
    "all these types of synchronization have been investigated mainly in identical systems and in systems with parameter mismatch .",
    "very occasionally it has been studied in distinctly nonidentical ( structurally different ) systems .",
    "but in reality , structurally different systems are predominant in nature and very often the phenomenon of synchronization ( gs ) is responsible for their evolutionary mechanism and proper functioning of such distinctly nonidentical systems .",
    "as typical examples , we may cite the cooperative functions of brain , heart , liver , lungs , limbs , etc .",
    ", in living systems and coherent coordination of different parts of machines , between cardiovascular and respiratory systems @xcite , different populations of species @xcite , in epidemics @xcite , in visual and motor systems @xcite , in climatology @xcite , in paced maternal breathing on fetal @xcite etc",
    ". it has also been shown that gs is more likely to occur in spatially extended systems and complex networks ( even in networks with identical nodes , due to the large heterogeneity in their nodal dynamics ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , gs has been experimentally observed in laser systems @xcite , liquid crystal spatial light modulators @xcite , microwave electronic systems @xcite and has applications in secure communication devices @xcite . therefore understanding the evolutionary mechanisms of many natural systems",
    "necessitates the understanding of the intricacies involved in the underlying generalized synchronization ( gs ) phenomenon .",
    "the phenomenon of gs has been well studied and understood in unidirectionally coupled systems @xcite , but still it remains largely unexplored in mutually coupled systems .",
    "only a limited number of studies are available on gs in mutually coupled systems even with parameter mismatches @xcite and rarely in structurally different dynamical systems with different fractal dimensions @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have revealed that gs emerges even in symmetrically ( mutually ) coupled network motifs in networks of identical systems , and that it also plays a vital role in achieving coherent behavior of the entire network @xcite . as almost all natural networks",
    "are heterogeneous in nature , the notion of gs has been shown to play a vital role in their evolutionary mechanisms @xcite . thus to unravel the role of gs in such large networks , it is crucial to understand the emergence of gs in heterogeneous network motifs composed of distinctly different nonidentical systems .",
    "it is to be noted that the notion of ps has been widely investigated in mutually coupled essentially different ( low - dimensional ) chaotic systems @xcite , while the notion of gs in such systems has been largely ignored .",
    "it is an accepted fact that ps is weaker than gs ( because ps does not add restrictions on the amplitude , and only the locking of the phases is crucial ) .",
    "parlitz et al .",
    "have shown that in general gs always leads to ps , if one can suitably define a phase variable , and that gs is stronger ( which has been studied in unidirectionally coupled chaotic systems ) .",
    "that is , ps may occur in cases where the coupled systems show no gs @xcite .",
    "further , the transition from ps to gs as a function of the coupling strength has been demonstrated in coupled time - delay systems with parameter mismatch which confirms that ps is weaker than gs @xcite . on the other hand , zhang and hu @xcite have demonstrated that gs is not necessarily stronger than ps , and in some cases ps comes after gs with increasing coupling strength depending upon the degree of parameter mismatch .",
    "they have concluded that ps ( gs ) emerges first for low ( high ) degree of parameter mismatch and that they both occur simultaneously for a critical range of mismatch in low - dimensional systems @xcite . in general , the notion of gs and its relation with ps in mutually coupled systems , particularly in distinctly nonidentical systems with different fractal dimensions including time - delay systems , need much deeper understanding .    in line with the above discussion , we have reported briefly the existence of gs in symmetrically coupled networks of distinctly nonidentical time - delay systems using the auxiliary system approach in a letter @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will provide an extended version of the letter with important additional results and explanations .",
    "in particular , in this paper we will demonstrate the occurrence of a transition from partial to global gs in mutually coupled networks of structurally different time - delay systems ( for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) with different fractal ( kaplan - yorke ) dimensions and in systems with different orders using the auxiliary system approach and the mutual false nearest neighbor ( mfnn ) method .",
    "we use the mackey - glass ( mg ) @xcite , a piecewise linear ( pwl ) @xcite , a threshold piecewise linear ( tpwl ) @xcite and the ikeda time - delay @xcite systems to construct heterogeneous network motifs . the main reason to consider time - delay systems in this study",
    "is that even with a single time - delay system , one has the flexibility of choosing systems with different fractal dimensions just by adjusting their intrinsic delay alone , which is a quite attracting feature of time - delay systems from modelling point of view @xcite .",
    "further , time - delay systems are ubiquitous in several real situations , including problems in ecology , epidemics , physiology , physics , economics , engineering and control systems , @xcite which inevitably require delay for a complete description of the system ( note that intrinsic delay is different from connection delays which arise between different units due to finite signal propagation time ) .    in our present work ,",
    "we report that there exists a common gs manifold even in networks of distinctly different time - delay systems .",
    "in other words , there exists a functional relationship even for systems with different fractal dimensions , which maps them to a common gs manifold .",
    "further , we also wish to emphasize that our results are not confined to just scalar one - dimensional time - delay systems alone but we confirm that there exists a similar type of synchronization transitions even in the case of time - delay systems of different orders .",
    "particularly , we demonstrate that synchronization phenomenon occurs in a system of a ikeda time - delay system ( first order time - delay system ) mutually coupled with a hopfield neural network ( a second order time - delay system ) , and in a system of a mg time - delay system ( first order time - delay system ) mutually coupled with a plankton model ( a third order system with multiple delays ) to establish the generic nature of our results .",
    "stability of gs manifold in unidirectionally coupled systems is usually determined by examining the conditional lyapunov exponents of the synchronization manifold  @xcite or the lyapunov exponents of the coupled system itself  @xcite .",
    "here , we will estimate the maximal transverse lyapunov exponent ( mtle ) to determine the asymptotic stability of the cs manifold of each of the systems with their corresponding auxiliary systems starting from different initial conditions , which in turn asserts the stability of gs between the original distinctly nonidentical time - delay systems .",
    "further , we will also estimate the cross correlation ( cc ) and the correlation of probability of recurrence ( cpr ) to establish the relation between gs and ps ( here gs and ps always occur simultaneously in structurally different time - delay systems ) .",
    "cc essentially gives a much better statistical average of the synchronization error , which is being widely studied to characterize cs .",
    "further , cpr is a recurrence quantification tool  @xcite , which effectively characterizes the existence of ps especially in highly non - phase - coherent hyperchaotic attractors usually exhibited by time - delay systems  @xcite .",
    "it is also to be noted that the auxiliary system approach has some practical limitations .",
    "this method fails for systems whose dynamical equations are not known .",
    "particularly , cs between response and auxiliary systems arises only when their initial conditions are set to be in the same basin of attraction . due to the above limitations of the auxiliary system approach",
    ", we have also calculated the mutual false nearest neighbor ( mfnn ) which doubly confirms our results .",
    "in addition , an analytical stability condition using the krasovskii - lyapunov theory is also deduced in suitable cases .",

    "in this section , we consider structurally different first order scalar time - delay systems with different fractal dimensions . here",

    "it is also clear from this figure that the number of positive les , and hence the complexity and dimension of the state space , generally increase with the delay time .",
    "further , the degree of complexity , measured by their number of positive les of the dynamics ( attractors ) exhibited by all the four systems are distinctly different even for the same value of time - delay .",
    "in fact , we have taken different values of delay for each of the systems , as pointed out by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , to demonstrate the existence of suitable smooth transformation that maps the strongly distinct individual systems to a common gs manifold .",

    "the mathematical formulation of this concept was put forward by kocarev and parlitz @xcite for a drive - response configuration in low - dimensional systems .",
    "they formulated it as the asymptotic convergence of the response and its auxiliary systems which are identically coupled to the drive system , starting from two different initial conditions from the same basin of attraction .",
    "the asymptotic convergence indeed ensures the existence of an attracting synchronization manifold ( cs manifold between the response and auxiliary systems and gs manifold between the drive and response systems ) @xcite . in other words ,",

    "<S> we point out the existence of transition from partial to global generalized synchronization ( gs ) in symmetrically coupled regular networks ( array , ring , global and star ) of distinctly different time - delay systems of different orders using the auxiliary system approach and the mutual false nearest neighbor method . it is established that there exist a common gs manifold even in an ensemble of structurally nonidentical time - delay systems with different fractal dimensions and we find that gs occurs simultaneously with phase synchronization ( ps ) in these networks . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the maximal transverse lyapunov exponent to evaluate the asymptotic stability of the complete synchronization manifold of each of the main and the corresponding auxiliary systems , which , in turn , ensures the stability of the gs manifold between the main systems . </S>",
    "<S> further we also estimate the correlation coefficient and the correlation of probability of recurrence to establish the relation between gs and ps . </S>",
    "<S> we also deduce an analytical stability condition for partial and global gs using the krasovskii - lyapunov theory . </S>"
