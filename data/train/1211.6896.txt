    "the regge - plus - resonance ( rpr ) framework provides a hybrid model that conjoins an isobar description of nucleon exchanges in the @xmath10 channel and the exchange of regge trajectories in the background channel .",
    "the members of a regge trajectory share identical internal quantum numbers , such as strangeness and isospin , but have different total spins .",
    "more specifically , the spins and the squared masses of the regge trajectory members are linearly related @xcite . as the @xmath0 reaction is dominated by background contributions at forward kaon scattering angles ,",
    "only @xmath11 channel regge trajectories are introduced in the rpr model .",
    "the featuring regge families of the rpr model are the @xmath12 and @xmath13 trajectories . by replacing the feynman propagators of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 diagrams with the corresponding regge propagators ,",
    "the reggeized background amplitude is obtained .    in the @xmath10 channel of the rpr model ,",
    "individual nucleon resonances are exchanged .",
    "these nucleon resonances have half - integral spins and are modeled by effective rarita - schwinger ( r - s ) fields .",
    "r - s field is the dirac field . only fields with a spin @xmath14",
    "will be referred to as r - s fields . ]",
    "the finite lifetime of a resonance is incorporated in the rpr model by replacing the real pole of the feynman propagator , i.e.  @xmath15 , with the imaginary pole @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the mass and the decay width of the resonance , respectively . in order to ensure that the resonance contributions vanish in the high-@xmath10 limit , a phenomenological hadronic form factor ( hff )",
    "is introduced .",
    "such a form factor essentially `` cuts off '' the @xmath10 channel amplitude beyond a certain energy scale .",
    "in ref .  @xcite",
    "a model was introduced that is now dubbed `` rpr-2007 '' . in this model ,",
    "only spin-@xmath19 and spin-@xmath20 nucleon resonances are included . while spin-@xmath19 interactions are straightforward to deal with , spin-@xmath20 ( in fact , spin @xmath14 in general ) couplings are more difficult to treat .",
    "the tensor - spinor representation of the r - s formalism inevitably invokes additional components for the r - s fields .",
    "these degrees of freedom are unphysical and are attributed to additional spin-@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 components , next to the physical components of the spin-@xmath23 r - s field .",
    "it is clear that these unphysical degrees of freedom should be eliminated from the transition amplitude in order to have reaction observables that are physically meaningful .    in rpr-2007",
    "so - called `` contact - invariant '' interaction lagrangians are used to characterize the spin-@xmath20 couplings @xcite .",
    "these lagrangians contain one ( two ) `` off - shell '' parameter(s ) for the strong ( electromagnetic ) vertex .",
    "there are hence three off - shell parameters for each amplitude that models a spin-@xmath20 resonance exchange .",
    "the hff that is used in rpr-2007 is of the gaussian form and has a common cutoff energy for all of the resonant amplitudes .",
    "the coupling constants , off - shell parameters , and the cutoff energy of the rpr-2007 model were optimized against the available , forward - angle experimental data at that time . the following resonance content was found for rpr-2007 : @xmath3 , @xmath24 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 and the missing resonance @xmath6 .",
    "[ rpr-2007_prediction ] shows the rpr-2007 prediction for the @xmath0 differential cross section at three different photon energies in the lab frame . at",
    "forward kaon angles rpr-2007 is fully consistent with the data . at backward kaon angles",
    ", however , the model deviates significantly from the data .",
    "moreover , an artificial bump is present and the situation worsens with increasing photon lab energy or , equivalently , increasing @xmath10 .",
    "the observed elevation between the data and the rpr-2007 predictions can , to minor extent , be attributed to the fact that only @xmath25 data were considered when optimizing the rpr-2007 parameters .",
    "the main cause , however , of the unphysical bumps at @xmath26 is the adopted inconsistent interaction lagrangians for the spin-@xmath20 vertices . as mentioned earlier , these lagrangians contain one or two off - shell parameters .",
    "now , these parameters allow for physical couplings to the unphysical components of the spin-@xmath20 r - s field .",
    "hence , they give rise to unphysical structures in the predicted observables , which can not be eliminated for any combination of the values of the off - shell parameters .",
    "what is more , the off - shell parameters are actually fitted to the data and , consequently , so are the artificial structures .",
    "clearly this is a peculiar situation and it has to be put right .     differential cross section at photon lab energies of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 mev .",
    "the rpr-2007 model is optimized against the @xmath25 data , which is indicated by the arrows .",
    "more details about the calculations and the data can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a formalism was developed in which the interaction of r - s fields with fundamental fields can be described in a consistent way .",
    "the consistent interaction lagrangians are invariant under the so - called `` unconstrained r - s gauge '' and it was proven that the unphysical components of the r - s field decouple from the transition amplitude for this type of interactions .",
    "moreover , the gauge - invariant lagrangians do not contain any additional parameters , apart from the usual coupling constants . in ref .",
    "@xcite a novel , spin - dependent hff was developed as well , dubbed the `` multidipole - gauss '' hff .",
    "this hff is able to regularize the amplitudes involving consistently interacting r - s fields , something that is not feasible with the standard gaussian hff .",
    "the combination of consistent high - spin interactions and the accompanying multidipole - gauss hff , constitutes the foundations of a new rpr model , i.e.  rpr-2011 .",
    "when it comes to specifying the set of nucleon resonances that has the most important contribution to the @xmath0 reaction , one faces a lack of consensus between the various analyses for the reaction at hand .",
    "this disagreement becomes clear by inspecting table i of ref .",
    "the difficulty in determining the resonance contributions lies in the observed dominance of background ( i.e.  @xmath11 channel ) reactions in the @xmath0 process .",
    "the challenge for the newly developed rpr model is to determine the most probable model variant @xmath30 ( read : the most probable set of resonances ) given the @xmath0 data @xmath31 of the last decade .",
    "the standard @xmath32 distribution for the rpr model variant space is only capable of specifying the set of resonances that offers the best description of the data @xmath31 .",
    "however , the @xmath32 distribution does not punish for the expansion of the set of resonances , i.e.  the addition of extra model parameters .",
    "in fact , the absolute minimum of the @xmath32 hypersurface is most likely relocated , in general , by increasing the dimension of the model parameter space .",
    "therefore , a model with a `` large '' number of contributing resonances is not a probable model .",
    "bayesian inference offers a quantitative way of selecting the most probable model amongst its possible variants .",
    "the bayesian evidence @xmath33 for a specific set of resonances is defined as the probability of the data @xmath31 , given the model variant @xmath30 , and can be expressed as @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the model s parameters .",
    "the integrand of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bayesian_evidence ] ) is the product of the likelihood function @xmath36 and the prior distribution @xmath37 . the prior distribution for the model s parameters @xmath35 is chosen to be a uniform distribution .",
    "now , consider the two model variants @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the probabilities for both models are given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 . by using bayes theorem ,",
    "the probability ratio @xmath42 can be calculated as @xmath43 since there is no prior preference for any of the two model variants , @xmath44 and the probability ratio reduces to the evidence ratio .",
    "the most probable model is therefore the model with the highest evidence . due to the non - gaussian and correlated nature of the systematic errors of @xmath31 ,",
    "the bayesian evidence is underestimated . in ref .",
    "@xcite an approximate expression can be found for the corresponding corrected evidence , i.e.  @xmath45 .    for the bayesian analysis of the rpr-2011 model ,",
    "11 candidate resonances up to spin-@xmath46 are considered .",
    "so next to the consistent couplings , rpr-2011 differs from rpr-2007 in the inclusion of spin-@xmath46 resonances .",
    "the candidate resonances are : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath24 , and @xmath5 ( established resonances ) , @xmath7 and @xmath9 ( less - established resonances ) , and @xmath6 and @xmath8 ( `` missing '' resonances ) .",
    "now , each of the @xmath50 model variants were optimized against @xmath31 ( 6148 data points to date ) and the corresponding @xmath45 value was calculated .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ best_rpr - estimate_ratio](a ) .",
    "the model variant with the highest evidence is indicated as `` rpr-2011 '' .",
    "the resonances that are not included in rpr-2011 are @xmath47 , @xmath49 , and @xmath24 . the best rpr model variant , i.e.  the one that includes all of the 11 candidate resonances , is hence not the most probable model . the individual probability ratio for each of the candidate resonances is shown in fig .  [ best_rpr - estimate_ratio](b ) .",
    "a positive ratio indicates that it is more probable that the resonance contributes to the reaction @xmath0 than that it does not .",
    "vice versa , a negative ratio implies that the possibility that the resonance contributes to the reaction is not supported by the data .",
    "there are only 3 resonances that have a negative probability ratio , which are exactly those that are not part of the resonance set of rpr-2011 .    in fig .",
    "[ rpr-2011_prediction ] the rpr-2011 prediction for the @xmath0 differential cross section is shown at four different photon lab energies .",
    "it is seen that the bumps at @xmath26 ( see fig .  [ rpr-2007_prediction ] ) are no longer present and that rpr-2011 offers a good description of the data for the whole range of kaon scattering angles .",
