    "hilbert geometries are a family of metric spaces defined in the interior of an open and bounded convex set using cross - ratios following the construction of the hyperbolic geometry s projective model @xcite .",
    "they are actually length space with an underlying finsler structure which is riemannian only if the convex set is an ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "the present paper focuses on the volume growth of these geometries and more specifically on the volume entropy .",
    "this immediately raises the problem of the definition of the volume one uses , as in finsler geometry there is nt uniqueness of the notion of volume . in this paper",
    "we will mostly work with two volumes : the _ busemann volume _ which also appears as the hausdorff measure associated to the distance , and the _ holmes - thompson _ volume which is built thanks to the natural symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle .",
    "the first one is more convenient for computational purposes , but the second one possesses better and crucial properties , such as minimality property of totally geodesic hypersurface @xcite .",
    "both happen to be equivalent and belong to a larger family of measures over the hilbert geometries that we call _ normalised density measures _ and for which all the results presented in this paper coincide .",
    "therefore in a open convex set @xmath0 , we will consider a member @xmath1 of this family of measures and if we denote by @xmath2 the metric ball of radius @xmath3 centred at the point @xmath4 , then the volume entropy of @xmath0 will be defined as @xmath5    let us stress out that thus defined , the entropy of @xmath0 does not depend on either the base point @xmath6 nor on the normalised density measure chosen and is actually a projective invariant attached to @xmath0 ( one can also replace the `` @xmath7 '' by a `` @xmath8 '' in all the definitions of this paper , and get the same results for the corresponding numbers ) .",
    "the question we address in this essay is the _ entropy upper bound conjecture _ which states that if @xmath0 is an open and bounded convex subset of @xmath9 , then @xmath10 .",
    "let us recall the main related results .",
    "the first one is a complete answer to the the conjecture in the two dimensional case by g.  berck & a.  bernig & c.  vernicos @xcite ] , where the authors actually obtained an upper bound as a function of @xmath11 , the upper minkowski dimension ( or _ ball - box _ dimension ) of the set of extremal points of @xmath0 , as follows : @xmath12    the second results is a more precise statement with respect to the asymptotic volume growth of balls and involves another projective invariant introduced by g.  berck & a.  bernig & c.  vernicos @xcite called the _ centro - projective _ area of @xmath0 defined by @xmath13 where for any @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the gauss curvature , @xmath16 the normal and @xmath17 the antipodal map defined by @xmath18 .",
    "let us remind the reader that both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defined almost everywhere as alexandroff s theorem states  @xcite .",
    "now we can state the second main result of g.  berck & a.  bernig & c.  vernicos @xcite which encloses former results by b.  colbois and p.  verovic  @xcite . if @xmath21 is @xmath22 , then @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , without any assumption on @xmath25 , if @xmath26 then @xmath27 .",
    "the third one which is also a rigidity results requires stronger assumptions on the hilbert geometries : they have to be divisible , which means that they admit a compact quotient , and they have to be hyperbolic in the sense of gromov , which implies by y.  benoist @xcite that their boundary is @xmath28 and strictly convex .",
    "let us stress out that among them only the hyperbolic geometry has a @xmath22 boundary , and as hyperbolicity implies non - nullity of the cheeger constant(see",
    "b.  colbois and c.  vernicos  @xcite ) , their entropy is strictly positive .",
    "m.  crampon  @xcite results states that for a divisible open bounded convex set @xmath0 in @xmath9 whose boundary is @xmath28 ,    * @xmath10 ; * and equality occurs if and only if @xmath0 is an ellipsoid .    in the present paper",
    "we relate the entropy to another invariant associated to a convex set , its _ approximability _ whose name was introduced by schneider and wieacker @xcite and which somewhat measure how well a convex set can be approximated by polytopes . more precisely , let @xmath29 be the smallest number of vertices of a polytope whose hausdorff distance to @xmath0 is less than @xmath30 .",
    "then the approximability of @xmath0 is @xmath31 the main result which is of interest for this essay is the following upper bound , obtained by fejes - toth  @xcite in dimension @xmath32 and by bronshteyn - ivanov  @xcite in the general case : if @xmath0 is a bounded open convex set in @xmath9 , then @xmath33    our main result it the following one    let @xmath34 be a bounded open convex set , then    * @xmath35 ; * if @xmath36 or @xmath37 then @xmath38 .",
    "the first important corollary is that it gives a proof of the entropy upper bound conjecture in dimension @xmath32 and @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded open convex set in @xmath9 , with @xmath39 , then @xmath10 .",
    "the second one tells us that in dimension @xmath32 there are hilbert geometries with intermediate volume growth .",
    "let @xmath40 be an increasing function such that @xmath41 then there exist an open bounded convex set @xmath42 in @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and three constants @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , such that for @xmath48 one has @xmath49 therefore there are convex sets @xmath0 with maximal entropy and zero centro - projective area , and there are convex sets with zero entropy which are not polytopes .",
    "this corollary directly follows from our proof of the main theorem ( see section [ lesinegalites ] ) and schneider and wieacker @xcite results on the approximability in dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the last statement follows from our work @xcite , where we showed that polytopes have polynomial growth of order @xmath50 in dimension two .",
    "the equalities and inequalities also implies the following four new results ,    let @xmath51 be a convex body ,    * @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the hausdorff dimension of the farthest points of @xmath0 .",
    "* if @xmath36 or @xmath37 , * * @xmath54 is a projective invariant of @xmath0 . * * let @xmath55 be the polar dual of @xmath0 , then @xmath56 .",
    "* if @xmath36 , then @xmath57 .",

    "if either @xmath62 or @xmath63 is at infinity the corresponding ratio will be taken equal to @xmath70 .",
    "note that the invariance of the cross ratio by a projective map implies the invariance of @xmath71 by such a map .",
    "these geometries are naturally endowed with a @xmath72 finsler metric @xmath73 as follows : if @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 , the straight line passing by @xmath6 and directed by @xmath77 meets @xmath61 at two points @xmath78 and @xmath79  .",
    "then let @xmath80 and @xmath81 be two positive numbers such that @xmath82 and @xmath83 , in other words these numbers corresponds to the time necessary to reach the boundary starting at @xmath6 with the speed @xmath77 and @xmath84 .",
    "then we define @xmath85 should @xmath78 or @xmath79 be at infinity , then corresponding ratio will be taken equal to @xmath86 .",

    "we shall denote by @xmath2 the metric ball of radius @xmath3 centred at the point @xmath4 and by @xmath87 the corresponding metric sphere .",
    "thanks to that finsler metric , we can built two important borel measures @xmath0 .",
    "the first one is called the _ busemann _ volume , will be denoted by @xmath1 ( it is actually the hausdorff measure associated to the metric space @xmath88 , see @xcite , exemple  5.5.13 ) , and is defined as follows . to any @xmath74 , let @xmath89 be the open unit ball in @xmath90 of the norm @xmath91 and @xmath92 the euclidean volume of the open unit ball of the standard euclidean space @xmath9 . consider the ( density ) function @xmath93 given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the canonical lebesgue measure of @xmath9 equal to @xmath70 on the unit `` hypercube '' .",

    "let @xmath99 be the polar dual of @xmath100 and @xmath101 the density defined by @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath98 is the measure associated to that density .",
    "we can actually consider a wider family of measure as follows let @xmath103 be the set of pointed properly open convex sets in @xmath9 .",
    "these are the pairs @xmath104 , such that @xmath105 is a properly open convex set and @xmath106 a point inside @xmath105 .",
    "we shall say that a function @xmath107 is a _ proper density _ if it is    continuous : :    with respect to the hausdorff pointed topology on    @xmath103 ; monotone decreasing : :    with respect to inclusion of the convex sets , i.e. , if    @xmath108 then    @xmath109 . chain rule compatible : :    if for any projective transformation @xmath110 one has    @xmath111    we will say that @xmath112 is a _ normalised proper density _ if in addition @xmath112 coincides with the standard riemannian volume on the hyperbolic geometry of ellipsoids . let us denote by @xmath113 the set of proper densities over @xmath103 .",
    "let us now recall a result of benzecri  @xcite which states that the action of the group of projective transformations on @xmath103 is co - compact .",
