    "for a long time wormholes have been regarded as exotic solutions of general relativity ( gr ) , more suitable for science fiction than representing true situations happening in nature . however , a number of developments and findings in the last few decades , including the seminal paper by morris and thorne@xcite , the supernova data@xcite suggesting the potential existence of exotic forms of energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe , and the different approaches to a quantum theory of gravity where topologically non - trivial structures could play a relevant role , have put these once bizarre objects under a new light . following visser@xcite ,",
    "a ( traversable ) time - independent , spherically symmetric wormhole space - time can be generically written as    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the proper time .",
    "wormholes are characterized by a number of properties , of which we underline the following :    * the coordinate @xmath1 covers the whole space - time @xmath2 . *",
    "the asymptotic flatness of the two regions connected by the wormhole requires the limits @xmath3 to be both finite .",
    "* at the asymptotically flat regions , @xmath4 , one has @xmath5 . *",
    "the throat of the wormhole satisfies @xmath6 .    loosely speaking ,",
    "wormhole are hypothetical tunnels connecting two asymptotically flat portions of the same universe , or two asymptotically flat universes .",
    "historically , the first example was given by the einstein - rosen bridge@xcite , which was later shown to be just two copies of the exterior region of a schwarzschild space - time joined at their event horizons .",
    "but with the new insights given by morris and thorne in their celebrated 1988 paper @xcite the interest on this field boosted .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , within the context of gr , wormholes violate all the pointwise energy conditions , and face the problematic issue of topology change . because of this , in the past they have been largely regarded as mere theoretical tools for the understanding and teaching of gr .",
    "the related concept of geon - gravitational electromagnetic entities - was introduced by j. a. wheeler@xcite as hypothetical objects mirroring the idea of body within gravitational physics .",
    "wheeler s original proposal consisted in _ balls of light _ , an electric beam with so high an intensity that would be held together by its own self - interaction . with the seasoning of",
    "non - trivial topology , misner and wheeler@xcite were able to give an interpretation of both charge and mass as properties resulting from lines of electric flux trapped in the non - trivial topology of a wormhole . in their picture",
    ", geons would represent self - gravitating objects resulting from the einstein - maxwell equations without sources with the ambitious goal of explaining all particle properties in terms of non - trivial topologies and fields .",
    "the geon program failed , partially due to the lack of explicit , physically motivated , and analytically tractable models .",
    "starting from a slightly different perspective , in a series of papers@xcite we have implemented a systematic analysis of classical effective geometries supported by modified theories of gravity .",
    "as opposed to the standard procedure in the literature , where a wormhole space - time is given _ a priori _ and then the einstein equations are driven back to find the matter sources generating such a geometry , in our approach we derive them from gravitational actions including additional contractions of the ricci tensor with the metric , and assuming independent metric and affine structures ( palatini approach ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the more standard metric approach , where the connection is given a priori by the christoffel symbols of the metric ( see e.g.@xcite for a review on modified gravity ) . in the last few years we have studied in detail such gravitational actions with electromagnetic fields and found that the black hole point - like singularity of gr is generically replaced by a wormhole structure .",
    "because of their properties , the resulting objects represent explicit implementations of wheeler s geon within the context of modified gravity .",
    "in palatini gravity , the field equations admit a gr - like representation of the form    @xmath7    this representation is valid for @xmath8 theories @xcite , @xmath9 theories @xcite , born - infeld gravity @xcite and in higher - dimensional@xcite and braneworld scenarios@xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath10 represents the transformation between the _ effective _ metric @xmath11 and the physical metric @xmath12 as @xmath13 and , though is model - dependent , can be shown to depend only on the matter stress - energy tensor @xmath14 , and the same applies to the gravity function @xmath15 .",
    "the independent connection @xmath16 is compatible with the metric @xmath11 , namely , @xmath17 ( but not with @xmath12 , @xmath18 ) , so it is given by the christoffel symbols of @xmath11 .",
    "the field equations ( [ eq : fieldeqs ] ) thus represent a system of second - order field equations , where all the terms on the right - hand - side only depend on the matter . as @xmath12 is algebraically related to @xmath11 via the matter sources , the field equations for @xmath12 are second - order as well . in vacuum , @xmath19 , the equations ( [ eq : fieldeqs ] )",
    "yield those of gr , which implies the absence of ghost - like degrees of freedom .    in static ,",
    "spherically symmetric space - times , we take the matter sector to be that of an electromagnetic field . by solving the field equations in different gravitational backgrounds",
    "[ see refs.@xcite for full details ] one finds a line element that can be written under the generic ( eddington - filkenstein ) form    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a re - scaled radial coordinate through @xmath22 , which typically contains the charge @xmath23 and some length scale @xmath24 encoding the deviations with respect to gr .",
    "the constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 parameterize the solutions in terms of mass , charge and length scale @xmath24 .",
    "the explicit form of the objects @xmath27 depends on the particular theory of gravity chosen , and the matter - dependent function @xmath28 typically recovers the gr behaviour , @xmath29 , at large distances ( provided an asymptotic coulombian behaviour ) , but undergoes drastic modifications around @xmath30 .",
    "the space - times ( [ eq : line element ] ) above satisfy a number of properties :    * asymptotic flatness is obtained provided that the matter fields satisfy usual energy conditions .",
    "slight modifications of ( [ eq : line element ] ) also allow for asymptotically ( anti-)de sitter solution @xcite . * for large distances , @xmath31 and the role of @xmath1 as the standard radial coordinate of the reissner - nordstrm space - time",
    "is restored . *",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath32 reaches a minimum @xmath33 at @xmath34 and bounces off [ see fig.[fig:1 ] ] . on this region ,",
    "large departures from the gr behaviour are found . *",
    "the existence or not of horizons depends on the combination of parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , namely , on the charge - to - mass ratio .",
    "this is in agreement with visser s requirements introduced discussed above and , therefore , the space - times ( [ eq : line element ] ) represent a generalization of the reissner - nordstrm solution where the point - like singularity is replaced by a finite - size wormhole structure , with the surface @xmath33 representing its throat .     for born - infeld gravity coupled to an electromagnetic field in the case @xmath35 ( see ref.@xcite for details ) in @xmath36 ( solid ) , @xmath37 ( dashed ) and @xmath38 ( dotted ) space - time dimensions , as given by the expression @xmath39 , where @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath23 the electric charge . for @xmath42 one",
    "has @xmath43 and the standard gr behaviour .",
    "a bounce occurs at @xmath33 , setting the location of the wormhole throat .",
    "[ fig:1],width=283,height=207 ]    in wheeler s approach@xcite geons are self - gravitating structures where the non - trivial topology of the geon allows to generate both its charge and mass without sources . in our case",
    ":    * the non - trivial topology of the wormhole allows to define the electric charge as the flux of electric lines through a @xmath44 surface enclosing the wormhole throat : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is hodge dual of the electromagnetic field and the sign @xmath47 comes from which side of the wormhole this computation is done .",
    "note that no point - like sources are needed , which is consistent with the sourceless electromagnetic field of the matter sector .",
    "a local observer on one of the sides of the wormhole would measure a positive ( or negative ) charge , though no charges are present in the system and the net global flux is zero , which represents a explicit implementation of the _ charge - without - charge _ mechanism . *",
    "evaluation of the total action ( gravitational + electromagnetic ) for these geonic solutions produce the generic result @xmath48 [ with @xmath49 some constant ] , where @xmath50 is the total mass of space - time ( as given by the mass seen by an asymptotic observer ) and the factor @xmath51 comes from the need of integrating on both sides of the wormhole .",
    "this is just the action of a point particle of mass @xmath52 .",
    "the new gravitational effects are essential for this result , which can be seen as an implementation of the _ mass - without - mass _ mechanism .    in order for these wormholes to be traversable one",
    "first requires the absence of horizons which , according to the discussion above , depends on the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for each model .",
    "moreover , one must guarantee its safeness , namely , that a physical observer crossing the wormhole throat is not destroyed on its transit .",
    "however , in the wormhole geometries above curvature divergences generically arise at the throat , @xmath33 , though in some scenarios they can be completely removed for a given mass - to - charge ratio@xcite .",
    "we point out that both the existence of the bounce in the wormhole radial function , and some physical properties associated to the geon ( like the energy density ) , are insensitive to the existence or not of curvature divergences [ these are generically much milder than their gr counterparts ] . indeed , a three - fold strategy - geodesic completeness , congruence of geodesics , and scattering of waves off the wormhole - has revealed that , in the case of quadratic and born - infeld gravity in four dimensions , curvature divergences seem to have little impact ( if any ) on physical observers , who find a geodesically complete space - time no matter the behaviour of curvature invariants and where no loss of causality occurs among the constituents making up the observer@xcite .",
    "one thus concludes that physical observers are not affected by any absolutely destructive effect as they cross the wormhole throat and thus these space - times constitute explicit examples where curvature divergences do not entail space - time singularities .",
    "let us point out that , as opposed to what happens in the gr case , the fact that we are using a standard electromagnetic field means that the energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "the generation of the wormhole structure is a genuine non - perturbative gravitational effect , since only as one gets close to the center of the solutions the wormhole modification of the point - like singularity of gr becomes manifest .",
    "the wormhole structure is robust , in the sense that it arises in different gravitational backgrounds and coupled to several kinds of matter , but disappears when the theories are formulated in the standard metric approach .",
    "in addition , these wormhole geometries might be generated in dynamical scenarios sourced by high - intensity fluxes of particles carrying mass and charge@xcite or even by large magnetic fields in the early universe@xcite , which could shed new light on the issues of topology change and the geometry of entanglement@xcite .",
    "in summary , in palatini theories of gravity , which are supported by the physics of crystalline structures with defects @xcite , self - gravitating , particle - like , non - singular solutions of sourceless equations generated by an electromagnetic field can be found .",
    "these classical effective geometries are able to generate a wormhole structure without any need of violation of the energy conditions , and without resorting to the standard thin - shell formalism or _ engineering _ constructions",
    ". implications of such geonic solutions regarding our understanding of particles and fields are still to be seen .",
    "since we have dealt with a simplified scenario with spherical symmetry and an electromagnetic field it is thus important to investigate if other particle properties ( like color charges or spin ) can be reproduced by adding other free gauge fields . in this way",
    ", geons might potentially yield an interesting phenomenology for gravitational and high - energy physics .",
