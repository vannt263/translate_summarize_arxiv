    "in recent years , and mainly due to the emergence of laser cooling techniques @xcite there has been an increasing interest on the physics of ultra - cold atoms .",
    "this interest has been mainly concentrated on the study of bose einstein condensates , and on the theoretical and experimental understanding of their properties @xcite .",
    "however , attention has also been given recently to the study of collective oscillations of non - condensed atomic molasses in the magneto - optical traps @xcite . from this work , collective behavior similar to",
    "that observed in plasma physics , has emerged , leading to the discovery of an equivalent electric charge for the neutral atoms , and of electrostatic type of interactions between nearby atoms @xcite , and to coulomb like explosions of the atomic cloud when the magnetic confinement is switched off @xcite .",
    "the theoretical modeling of such collective processes is still not well established , and this is the main motivation of the present work .",
    "here we propose to apply the well known methods of waves and oscillations in plasmas to such processes in a neutral gas .    in this work",
    "we consider the collective behavior of ultra - cold atom gas , in order to identify the basic mechanisms of oscillation , to establish its frequencies and to derive dispersion relations for its basic modes of propagation phenomena .",
    "we will use both fluid and kinetic descriptions where the main forces associated with the laser cooling processes are retained .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we define some essential parameters to describe the features of a cold atomic cloud confined in a magneto - optical trap .",
    "the basic set of fluid equations is also established . in sec .",
    "iii , we report the existence of brand new hybrid mode for short wavelength scales , somewhere between plasma waves and acoustic waves . in sec .",
    "iv , we adress the oscillations for the long wavelength scales , where we discover modified tonks - dattner resonances , which correspond to confined hybrid oscillations inside the atomic cloud , formally similar to those in ref .",
    "nonlinear hybrid resonances driven by the dipolar oscillations are predicted in sec .",
    "v. we also use a wave kinetic approach , in order to refine the fluid description and describe new phenomena .",
    "hence , in sec . vi we describe the system via a fokker - planck equation that can be directly derived from the schroedinger equation for the collective field of the atoms in the radiation and trapping fields .",
    "it is shown that the waves and oscillations in the gas can be damped by a resonant atomic interaction with the collective oscillations , which is a manifestation of landau damping .",
    "we will also show that a spectrum of collective oscillations will lead to diffusion in the atomic velocity space , thus preventing the laser cooling process to proceed further .",
    "this effect is added to other diffusion processes already known in the literature .",
    "finally , some conclusions are stated .",
    "the simplest model to describe a gas of cold atoms in a magneto - optical trap is based on doppler cooling @xcite and on the spatial confinement due to the presence of a magnetic field gradient .",
    "the relevant average forces acting on a single atom are based on the quasi - resonant radiation pressure force and can be written ( for a convenient choice of the relative polarisations of the laser beams and the atomic transition ) for each direction @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) as    @xmath4 } \\end{array } \\label{force}\\ ] ]    this expression relies on the low intensity doppler model for the magneto - optical force ( incident on - resonance saturation parameter per beam @xmath5 ) .",
    "the zeeman shifts ( described by @xmath6 ) and doppler shifts ( @xmath7 ) are responsible for trapping and cooling respectively . here",
    "@xmath8 is the laser intensity of laser beams incident along the six directions , @xmath9 the natural line width of the transition used in the cooling process and @xmath10 the frequency detuning between the laser frequency @xmath11 and the atomic transition frequency @xmath12 .",
    "assuming symmetric forces ( @xmath13 ) along each of the three directions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 one can write to first order in @xmath17 and @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the spring constant of the trap and @xmath21 the friction coefficient ,    @xmath22 ^ 2}\\quad,\\quad \\kappa = \\alpha \\mu / k_l   \\label{eq:2.1b}\\ ] ]    which is related to the dipole frequency    @xmath23    where @xmath24 represents the mass of a single atom . even though most magneto - optical traps using for instance alkaline atoms ( such as na , li , k , rb or cs ) are not completely described by such a simple doppler model @xcite ,",
    "the forces above constitute a good first approach to describe the dynamics of single atoms in a magneto - optical trap .",
    "this description of a magneto - optical trap is known to be limited to only moderate number of atoms ( typically @xmath25 ) . for larger atom number additional forces",
    "need to be taken into consideration .",
    "a second force to be considered is the shadow force , or absorption force , @xmath26 , and was first discussed by dalibard @xcite .",
    "this is associated with the gradient of the incident laser intensity due to laser absorption by the atomic cloud .",
    "it is an attractive force which can be determined by a poisson type of equation , as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the atom density and @xmath29 the laser absorption cross section .",
    "finally , a third force , @xmath30 , can be called repulsive force or radiation trapping force , and was first considered by sesko et al @xcite .",
    "it describes atomic repulsion , due to the radiation pressure of scattered photons on nearby atoms , and can also be determined by a poisson type of equation    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the atom scattering cross section .",
    "a detailed discussion of these forces and explicit expressions for the cross sections @xmath32 and @xmath29 can be for instance found in @xcite .",
    "these expressions for the forces acting on the atomic clouds and due to the laser cooling beams , correspond to the simplest possible description of the laser cloud interaction , and can be used in a first approximation to model the fluid dynamics of the ultra - cold gas , which can be derived by computing the zeroth and the first momenta of the fokker - planck equation , neglecting the diffusion term @xcite .",
    "the basic set of equations can then be written as    @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath18 are the density and velocity field of the gas respectively , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the gas pressure .",
    "here we have also defined the collective force @xmath38 , which is determined by the poisson equation resulting from equations ( [ eq:2.2a ] ) and ( [ eq:2.2b ] ) ,    @xmath39    the system can then be regarded as a one component plasma where the electrostatic attractive force due to ions can be formaly replaced by the confining force , in such way that , for the unperturbed state @xmath40 , we may represent the total force through a laplace - like equation    @xmath41    in typical experimental conditions the repulsive forces largely dominate over the shadow effect , and the quantity @xmath42 is positive @xcite , which allows us to define the typical frequency @xmath43 which is a straight - forward generalization of the well - known electron plasma frequency . comparing this expression with the usual definition of the plasma frequency @xmath44 in an ionized medium ,",
    "we conclude that neutral atoms behave as if they had an equivalent electric charge , as first noticed by @xcite , with the value @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the vacuum electric permitivity .",
    "the experimental value observed for this effective atomic charge is @xmath47 to @xmath48 times the electron charge . in a typical mot experiment",
    ", we expect to have @xmath49 , @xmath50 , what yields a plasma frequency in the range of @xmath51 .",
    "it is clear from equation ( [ freqp ] ) that plasma like oscillations are only possible for @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , they can not occur when the shadow force ( [ eq:2.2a ] ) dominates over the repulsive scattering force ( [ eq:2.2b ] ) .    in order to conclude the analogy between the fundamental parameters between the plasma and the cold atoms ,",
    "one remark should be made concernig the motion of the center - of - mass @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , for a typical neutral plasma with spherical geometry , it is a well know result that the center - of - mass oscillates at the so - called mie frequency @xmath55 , where the factor @xmath56 arises from the spherical symmetry @xcite and is an essential parameter in the description of resonances in clusters @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of a spherical cloud of cold atoms , it is a simple task to verify that the center - of - mass obeys the following equation of motion    @xmath57    which states that the @xmath58 oscillates exactly at the dipole frequency @xmath59 , corresponding to the generalized plasma frequency @xmath60 in the unperturbed state @xmath40 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ freqp ] ) .",
    "the reason for this difference remains in the fact that , in the case of the spherical plasmas , the restoring force depends on the charge balance between ions and electrons @xmath61 , which on the other hand depends on the shape of the cloud . in the case of cold atoms ,",
    "the potential is unequivocally determined by the laser and the magnetic field ( say trapping ) parameters , and therefore the shape and the atomic cloud plays no role .    in",
    "what follows , we make use the set of fluid equations derived in this section for a quasi - continum medium and describe the main collective modes .",
    "we start from the infinite medium approximation , to emphasize the nature of the oscillations , and then introduce in sec .",
    "iv the effect of the finite size of the cloud .",
    "we first assume oscillations that can be excited in the cold gas with a wavelength much smaller that its radius . the medium can therefore be assumed as infinite .",
    "we then assume that the equilibrium state of the gas is perturbed by oscillations with frequency @xmath62 and wavevector @xmath63 . in the sense of linear response theory ,",
    "we linearize the above fluid and poisson equations , by defining perturbations around the equilibrium quantities    @xmath64    since the trapping force @xmath65 defines only the equilibrium quantities and plays no role in the modes we are about to describe , we drop the subscript @xmath66 for the perturbation in the collective force @xmath67 in ( [ eq:2.5b ] ) for the sake of simplicity . for the closure of the system of fluid equations , one equation of state for the hydrodinamical pressure must be given .",
    "in this paper , we assume that @xmath37 is given by an adiabatic equation of the form    @xmath68     ( color online ) normalized dispersion relation @xmath69 plotted against @xmath70 .",
    "the red dashed line represents the acoustic assimptotic behavior of the hybrid waves . ]    where @xmath71 represents the adiabatic constant .",
    "the implications of this assumption will be stated in sec .",
    "v , in the context of a kinetic description . using the later together with equations ( [ eq:2.3a ] ) , ( [ eq:2.3b ] ) and ( [ eq:2.4a ] )",
    ", we can easily obtain @xmath72 \\tilde{n } = \\left ( \\frac{u_s^2 \\nabla \\tilde{n}}{n_0 } - \\frac{\\delta \\vec{f}}{m } \\right ) \\cdot \\nabla n_0 \\label{eq:2.6}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 can be identified with the sound speed    @xmath74    and @xmath75 is the equilibrium gas pressure .",
    "we will now assume that the atomic equilibrium density @xmath76 is uniform , in consistence with the harmonic nature of the trapping potential , therefore neglecting the right hand side of equation ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) .",
    "the influence of boundary conditions and inhomogeneities on the collective oscillations of the gas will be discussed later . assuming a space - time dependence of the perturbations @xmath77 and @xmath78 of the form @xmath79 , with a complex frequency @xmath80",
    ", we obtain for the dispersion relation and for the corresponding damping rate , the values    @xmath81    in the limit of very small viscosity @xmath82 , the later dispersion relation reduces to @xmath83 , which is formally identical to the dispersion relation of electron or plasma waves in ionized media ( also known as langmuir waves ) but where the electron thermal velocity @xmath84 , ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the electron temperature and mass ) is replaced by the sound velocity divided by a numerical factor @xmath87 . according to the experimental parameters",
    "refereed in the previous section , we estimate the sound velocity to value @xmath88 .",
    "this shows that the wave mode described by equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) contains elements of both electron plasma waves and acoustic waves .",
    "it possesses a lower cut - off , given by @xmath89 , which is typical on an electron plasma wave , but its phase velocity tends to the sound velocity @xmath73 and becomes weakly dispersive as an acoustic wave .",
    "its corresponding quasi - particles can therefore be seen as hybrid entities , somewhere between plasmons and phonons .",
    "the excitation of such modes in a typical mot setup could be driven by modulating one of the six trapping laser beams .",
    "such modulation should be nearly resonant with @xmath60 , and hence one may excite hybrid waves by sweeping the modulation frequency around @xmath90 .",
    "associated with the propagation of such waves , we expect to observe a periodic variation on the intensity of the luminosity . by measuring the period of this oscillation , one can identify the excited mode .",
    "the existence of such an hybrid mode is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "the hybrid mode discussed above is only meaningful in infinite and homogeneous media . in physical terms",
    ", its dispersion relation can only be applied to waves that propagate locally , with wavelength scales much smaller than the inhomogeneity scale and the cloud dimensions .",
    "let us consider now oscillations with a wavelength that is comparable with the size of the atomic cloud .",
    "in this case we can no longer neglect the boundary conditions .",
    "going back to equation ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) , we assume that the density perturbations oscillate at a frequency @xmath62 as previously , but the corresponding spatial structure will be determined by the expressions    @xmath91 \\tilde{n } = \\frac{\\delta \\vec{f}}{m u_s^2 } \\cdot \\nabla n_0 + \\nabla \\ln n_0 \\cdot \\nabla \\tilde{n}},\\nonumber\\\\\\\\   \\displaystyle{\\nabla \\cdot \\delta \\vec{f } = q \\tilde{n } } \\end{array } \\label{eq:3.1}\\ ] ]    where the space dependent wavenumber @xmath92 is defined by    @xmath93 / u_s^2 \\label{eq:3.2}\\ ] ]    before going into a more complex model , it is useful to consider the simple one - dimensional problem @xcite . in the case of a uniform slab of cold gas , we have @xmath94 , except at the boundaries @xmath95 and @xmath96 . equations ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) then reduce to a simple one - dimensional equation    @xmath97 \\tilde{n } = 0 \\label{eq:3.3}\\ ] ]    taking the boundary conditions @xmath98 , we obtain the following dispersion relation    @xmath99 \\label{eq:3.4}\\ ] ]    where the quantum number @xmath100 can take the values @xmath101 , and the quantity @xmath102 is the debye length for a cold neutral gas , in analogy with the plasma definition ( where however the sound speed @xmath73 is replaced by @xmath103 , as mentioned before ) .",
    "this defines a natural length above which plasma effects should be expected . following the previously estimated values for @xmath60 and @xmath73",
    ", we expect to observe a debye length of the order of @xmath104 . in a typical mot experiment",
    ", the radius of the cloud varies between @xmath105 , yielding the relation @xmath106 .",
    "hence , plasma - like effects are expected to take place in a cloud containing a moderate number of atoms . as a remark",
    ", we should stress out that there is no experimental evidence so far of any equation of state @xmath107 , which may compromise the definition of the sound speed @xmath73 .",
    "+    the relation ( [ eq:3.4 ] ) shows that the finite dimensions of the slab imply the existence of a series of resonant modes with an integer number of half - wavelengths .",
    "the cylindrical geometry was considered , for the plasma case , in a famous paper by parker , nickel and gould in 1964 @xcite , but it is more natural here to consider a spherical geometry for the ultra - cold gas which , to our knowledge , was not derived for a plasma .",
    "we expect to find an infinite series of resonances , similar to equation ( [ eq:3.4 ] ) , known as the tonks - dattner resonances @xcite . for this purpose , we consider the internal oscillations in a spherical cloud with radius @xmath108 in the homogeneous case , where @xmath109 , for @xmath110 , for which analytical solutions can be found .",

    "moreover , a kinetic approach avoids the use of an equation of state for the hydrodinamical pressure @xmath37 .",

    "the temporal evolution of @xmath212 under the influence of the fluctuation spectrum is determined by a diffusion equation of the form    @xmath213    where the new diffusion tensor @xmath214 , associated with the collective oscillations , is determined by    @xmath215    comparing this with our previous kinetic equation ( [ eq:5.2 ] ) it can be seen that the existence of a collective spectrum of oscillations introduces an additional diffusion effect in atomic velocity space , which tends to prevent the atomic cooling process .",
    "as we have noticed , these results are only valid in the limit of a negligible viscosity parameter , @xmath216 .",
    "a finite value of @xmath21 will have two distinct consequences .",
    "first , it will lead to the damping coefficient already stated by equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) , adding to the purely kinetic landau damping .",
    "second , it will broaden of the landau resonance appearing in the dispersion relation ( [ eq:5.6 ] ) , and in the diffusion coefficient ( [ eq:5.15 ] ) therefore reducing the efficiency of the resonant atom - collective wave interactions associated with the landau resonance and to the quasi - linear diffusion .",
    "it will therefore compete with the kinetic effects described in this section .",
    "the combined influence of viscous and kinetic damping is outside the scope of the present work and would deserve a separate investigation .",
    "in this work we have used both fluid and kinetic equations to describe the collective oscillations in a cloud of neutral atoms confined in a magneto - optical trap .",
    "our approach is based on a simple but physically relevant model for the forces acting on the cold atoms , which has been well verified by the experiments , and can be described by a poisson equation similar to that describing electrostatic interactions @xcite . once the physical picture was established , we started by setting the basic equations and parameters .",
    "we have also shown that the existence of internal forces leads to the existence of collective waves which have an hybrid character , with properties that are common to both electron plasma waves and acoustic waves .",
    "the similarities and differences of the cold atom gas oscillations and those of a plasma were discussed .",
    "taking into account the finite size effect in a cloud of cold atoms , we have shown that internal resonances of these hybrid oscillations inside the cloud can be excited .",
    "these modes should be called tonks - dattner resonances , in analogy with similar plasma physics effects , since they are shown here also to exist in a neutral magneto - optical trapped gas as well .",
    "previous models developed for plasmas were limited to planar and cylindrical geometries , and they were extended to the spherical geometry which is more relevant to the cold atom clouds .",
    "we have extended our discussion of these oscillations to the nonlinear regime , where coupling between dipole oscillations and hybrid waves can take place .",
    "our approximate description suggests that such a nonlinear coupling can lead to the destabilization of hybrid waves or tonks - dattner resonances , driven by dipolar oscillations of the cloud center of mass .",
    "our analysis proceeded with a kinetic approach . using this more refined description of oscillations",
    ", we were able to derive more general dispersion relations where non - dissipative landau damping was included .",
    "we have limited our discussion to hybrid wave modes with wavelengths much smaller than the typical dimensions of the atomic cloud .",
    "but , the results can easily be extended to the confined tonks - dattner resonances .",
    "finally , we have established a quasi - linear kinetic equation , showing the occurrence of diffusion in atomic velocity space .",
    "this diffusion effect is a direct consequence of the collective fluctuation spectrum , and implies the existence of new collective processes preventing the occurrence of laser cooling .    in the present work",
    "we have explored the similarities of the could atom cloud with a plasma , which can be associated with the existence of an effective electric charge for the neutral atoms .",
    "the resulting wave modes however are not identical to the plasma wave modes , but show an hybrid character .",
    "we hope that this work will motive future experimental and theoretical work on the collective oscillations in cold atom traps , and will contribute to launch cold atom research in new directions ."
