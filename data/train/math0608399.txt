    "in the last few years , mean curvature flow of higher codimension submanifolds has attracted some attention .",
    "most of the work done has focused on finding initial conditions that assure the flow will exist for all time .",
    "for instance , under some natural convexity assumptions on the image of the gauss map , long time existence and convergence results have been proved by j. chen , j. li , and tian @xcite , smoczyk @xcite , smoczyk and m .-",
    "wang @xcite , m .-",
    "tsui and m .-",

    "wang @xcite . on the other hand , finite time singularities for mean curvature flow in the higher codimension case",
    "are not so well understood and , reasoning in analogy with minimal surfaces , they are expected to exhibit a far more complicated behavior than in the codimension one case .",
    "there is , therefore , interest in identifying initial conditions for the flow that are broad enough to admit singularities , but restrictive enough so that the singularities are , so to speak , `` well - behaved '' .",
    "a natural candidate for such an initial condition is _ lagrangian _ because , when the ambient manifold is khler - einstein , the lagrangian condition is preserved by mean curvature flow ( see @xcite ) .",
    "mu - tao wang observed in @xcite that , when the ambient manifold is calabi - yau , _ almost - calibrated _ lagrangians ( see next section for the definition ) can not develop type i singularities , i.e. , no sequence of rescaled flows at a singularity can converge strongly to a homothetically shrinking solution .",
    "later , jingyi chen and jiayu li @xcite showed that in this setting the sequence of rescaled flows converges weakly to an integer rectifiable stationary lagrangian varifold which is also a cone .    in this paper",
    "we study finite time singularities for zero - maslov class lagrangians in @xmath0 , a more general condition than being almost - calibrated . the first result , theorem",
    "a , states that the tangent flow at a singularity can be decomposed into a finite union of area - minimizing lagrangian cones .",
    "theorem b is a more interesting result because , assuming the initial condition is an almost - calibrated and _ rational _ lagrangian , it states that the lagrangian angle converges to a _",
    "constant on each _ connected _ component of the rescaled flow . in particular",
    ", this implies that connected components of the rescaled flow converge weakly to a single area - minimizing lagrangian cone , instead of a possible non - area - minimizing union of area - minimizing lagrangian cones .",
    "heuristically speaking , such property qualifies the formation of singularities as being , so to speak , `` well behaved '' . without such behavior",
    ", it would be hopeless to expect lagrangian mean curvature flow to be more tractable than general higher codimension mean curvature flow .",
    "we remark that any lagrangian @xmath2 with @xmath3 finitely generated can always be perturbed in order to become rational .    assuming some rotational symmetry",
    ", we also construct zero - maslov class exact lagrangians that develop finite time singularities under lagrangian mean curvature flow .",
    "these examples include lagrangians with arbitrarily small oscillation of the lagrangian angle and lagrangians which are hamiltonian isotopic to a plane .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ prelim ]",
    "we recall some standard definitions and results that will be useful throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "the main two results are discussed and stated in section [ state ] .",
    "examples of finite time singularities for lagrangian mean curvature flow are given in section [ examples ] .",
    "the first result , theorem a , is proven in section [ a ] . in section [ basic ]",
    "we derive evolution equations of some geometric quantities that will be needed in section [ b ] . in this section",
    "we prove theorem b.    the author would like to express his gratitude to richard schoen for all of his guidance and insight .",
    "he would also like to thank leon simon and brian white for enlightening discussions and constant availability .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote , respectively , the standard complex structure on @xmath0 and the standard symplectic form on @xmath0 .",
    "we consider also the closed complex - valued @xmath6-form given by @xmath7 and the liouville form given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 are complex coordinates of @xmath0 .",
    "a smooth @xmath6-dimensional submanifold @xmath10 in @xmath0 is said to be _ lagrangian _ if @xmath11 and this implies that ( see @xcite ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the volume form of @xmath10 and @xmath14 is some multivalued function called the _",

    "the concept of being special lagrangian can be easily extended to the case when @xmath10 is an integral current .    for a smooth lagrangian",
    ", the relation between the lagrangian angle and the mean curvature is given by the following remarkable property ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath23    let @xmath24 be a smooth lagrangian in @xmath0 such that , for some constant @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 for all @xmath27 sufficiently large and assume that we have a solution @xmath28 to mean curvature flow for which the second fundamental form of @xmath29 is bounded by a time dependent constant .",
    "the same argument used in @xcite and the maximum principle for noncompact manifolds proved by ecker and huisken in @xcite imply that the lagrangian condition is preserved . in this case",
    ", we say that we have a solution to _ lagrangian mean curvature flow_. moreover , if @xmath24 is also zero - maslov class , then this condition is preserved by the flow and , according to @xcite , the lagrangian angles @xmath30 can be chosen so that @xmath31 an immediate application of the parabolic maximum principle shows that the almost - calibrated condition is preserved by lagrangian mean curvature flow .",
    "a lagrangian @xmath24 is said to be _ rational _ if for some real number @xmath32 @xmath33 any lagrangian having @xmath34 finitely generated can be perturbed in order to become rational . when @xmath35 the lagrangian is called _",
    "exact_. furthermore , if @xmath24 is also zero - maslov class , we will see in section [ basic ] that the rational condition is preserved by lagrangian mean curvature flow , i.e. , @xmath36 while the solution exists smoothly .",
    "assume now that the solution to mean curvature flow develops a singularity at the point @xmath37 in space - time .",

    "* lemma 8) that for every sequence @xmath39 going to infinity there is a a subsequence for which the @xmath40 converges weakly to a homothetically shrinking weak solution of mean curvature flow ( brakke flow ) .",
    "this solution is called _ tangent flow _ and depends on the sequence @xmath39 taken .",
    "let @xmath41 be a smooth solution to lagrangian mean curvature flow in @xmath0 satisfying , for some constant @xmath25 , the area bounds @xmath26 for all @xmath27 sufficiently large .",
    "furthermore , assume that the flow develops a finite time singularity at time @xmath42 and that @xmath24 is zero - maslov class with bounded lagrangian angle .",
    "we denote the lagrangian angle of a rescaled flow @xmath43 by @xmath44 . arguing informally ,",
    "the following theorem states that a sequence of rescaled flows at a singularity converges weakly to a finite union of integral special lagrangian cones .",
    "if @xmath24 is zero - maslov class with bounded lagrangian angle , then for any sequence of rescaled flows @xmath43 at a singularity , there exist a finite set @xmath45 and integral special lagrangian cones @xmath46 such that , after passing to a subsequence , we have for every smooth function @xmath47 compactly supported , every @xmath48 in @xmath49 , and every @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the radon measure of the support of @xmath54 and its multiplicity respectively .",
    "furthermore , the set @xmath55 does not depend on the sequence of rescalings chosen .",
    "* it is possible and expected that , for instance , @xmath56 but the supports of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are all the same . * in case @xmath59 , it is well known that the support of area - minimizing cones are planes intersecting transversely .",
    "theorem a follows from combining standard ideas from geometric measure theory with the evolution equation @xmath60 we will show that , after using huisken monotonicity formula @xcite , such equation implies that for all @xmath61 and all positive @xmath27 @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the vector determined by the point @xmath64 in @xmath0 and @xmath65 denotes the projection of the vector @xmath63 onto the orthogonal complement of @xmath66 . hence , for almost all @xmath50 we get that for all positive @xmath27 @xmath67 and this implies that , after passing to a subsequence , @xmath68 converges weakly to a stationary integral varifold @xmath10 which is also a cone .",
    "note that so far @xmath10 could be a union of three lagrangian half - planes meeting at angles of @xmath69 along a common boundary .",
    "we now sketch briefly why such configuration can not occur because the proof of theorem a consists essentially in exploiting this argument .",
    "suppose that each of the half - planes have lagrangian angles @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "then , for all sufficiently small @xmath16 , @xmath72 converges to a half - plane and so @xmath73 this is impossible because , using the coarea formula and hlder s inequality , we have @xmath74    theorem a raises the following question : given @xmath75 a sequence of connected components of @xmath76 that converges weakly to @xmath77 , does @xmath77 need to be a slag cone ?",
    "in other words , does @xmath44 need to converge to a constant ? according to theorem a we only know that @xmath77 is a finite union of slag cones which might have different lagrangian angles and hence not necessarily area - minimizing .",
    "an affirmative answer to this question is necessary if one wants to make reasonable the possibility of developing a regularity theory for the flow .",
    "technically , the difficulty comes from the fact that because the sequence of smooth manifolds @xmath68 are becoming singular when @xmath78 goes to infinity , no poincar inequality holds with a constant independent of @xmath78 and therefore we can not conclude that , on each connected component of @xmath68 , the lagrangian angles @xmath44 converge to a constant . as a matter of fact , for the sequence of smooth surfaces @xmath79 one can easily construct bounded functions @xmath80 for which the @xmath81 norm of its gradient goes to zero when @xmath16 goes to zero but nevertheless @xmath80 converges to a distinct constant on each complex plane .",
    "the question raised in the previous paragraph was addressed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) but unfortunately this technical aspect was overlooked . in order to deal with this difficulty",
    ", we require @xmath24 to satisfy two additional conditions , namely that it is an almost - calibrated and rational lagrangian ( see section [ prelim ] for the definitions ) . we argued in section [ prelim ] that these conditions are preserved by lagrangian mean curvature flow .",
    "if @xmath24 is almost - calibrated and rational , then , after passing to a subsequence of @xmath43 , the following property holds for all @xmath82 and almost all @xmath83 .    for any convergent subsequence ( in the radon measure sense ) @xmath75 of connected components of @xmath84 intersecting @xmath85",
    ", there exists a special lagrangian cone @xmath10 in @xmath86 with lagrangian angle @xmath87 such that @xmath88 for every @xmath48 in @xmath89 and every smooth @xmath47 compactly supported in @xmath86 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote the radon measure of the support of @xmath10 and its multiplicity respectively .",
    "next , we give a heuristic argument explaining why the rational condition should play a role . from the pioneering work of richard hamilton both on ricci flow and on mean curvature flow we know that it is helpful to find quantities that are constant on self - similar solutions . for that matter ,",
    "let us consider @xmath92 to be a solution to lagrangian mean curvature flow where @xmath24 is zero - maslov class .",
    "a simple computation reveals that for all @xmath93 @xmath94 thus , we conclude that @xmath95 is exact and that if we denote by @xmath96 the primitive for the liouville form @xmath97 , then @xmath98 is constant in space for all @xmath99 .",
    "arguing informally , this suggests that showing convergence of the lagrangian angle to a single constant should be equivalent to showing that the primitive for the liouville form converges to a single constant .",
    "the advantage of doing so is that the gradient of @xmath96 is a first order quantity and thus easier to control than the gradient of @xmath100 which is a second order quantity .",
    "we now sketch the main idea behind the proof of theorem b. assume , for the sake of simplicity , that @xmath24 is exact which implies that for each @xmath78 there is a family of smooth functions @xmath101 defined on @xmath68 such that @xmath102 or equivalently , @xmath103 moreover , as it will be shown in section [ basic ] , the functions @xmath101 can be chosen so that @xmath104 this evolution equation combined with identity implies that , after passing to a subsequence , @xmath105 has a limit which is independent of @xmath99 and so it must converge to some constant @xmath106 on each special lagrangian cone @xmath54 , with @xmath107 hence , we obtain from theorem a that @xmath101 converges to @xmath108 on each @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , we can assume without loss of generality that the set @xmath109 has @xmath110 distinct values .",
    "let @xmath111 be a convergent sequence of connected components of @xmath76 .",
    "because the gradient of @xmath101 is _ pointwise bounded _ and its @xmath81-norm converges to zero , we can show that the sequence of functions @xmath101 converges to a single constant when restricted to @xmath111 ( see proposition [ cont ] ) .",
    "thus , the lagrangian angle of @xmath111 must converge to a constant because otherwise two numbers in the set @xmath112 would be equal .",
    "we construct examples of finite time singularities for mean curvature flow where the initial condition is a zero - maslov class and exact lagrangian .    for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath113 but we note that the phenomena observed also occur in @xmath0 .",
    "given a curve @xmath114 in the complex plane , it is easy to see that @xmath115 is a lagrangian surface in @xmath113 .",
    "a choice of orientation for the curve @xmath114 induces an orientation on @xmath10 and if @xmath116 denotes a parametrization of @xmath114 , then @xmath117 hence , we get that @xmath10 is exact and zero - maslov class whenever @xmath114 is diffeomorphic to a line .",
    "if we evolve @xmath10 by mean curvature flow , the rotational symmetries are preserved and the corresponding @xmath118 evolve according to @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the curvature of @xmath114 and @xmath121 denotes the projection of the position vector @xmath122 on the orthogonal complement of @xmath123 .",
    "for any @xmath124 , consider the following initial condition for the _ equivariant mean curvature flow _ @xmath125 the corresponding lagrangian surface @xmath24 is asymptotic to two oriented planes with lagrangian angles @xmath126 and @xmath127 and , when @xmath128 , its intersection with @xmath129 can be seen in figure [ fig2 ] .    in order to compute the lagrangian angle of @xmath24",
    ", we use the formula @xmath130 and obtain that @xmath131 note that the oscillation of the lagrangian angle can be made arbitrarily small by choosing @xmath132 close to @xmath133 .",
    "we now sketch briefly three distinct behaviors for the equivariant mean curvature flow .",
    "when @xmath134 , the curve will expand indefinitely because the curvature term on the right hand side of points outward and dominates the first - order term that points inward . as a matter of fact , anciaux @xcite found a self - expander with the same asymptotics at infinity as @xmath135 .",
    "when @xmath136 , the lagrangian surface is one of the special lagrangians studied in @xcite .",
    "thus , the curvature term equals the first order term on because the curve is a fixed point for the flow . finally , when @xmath137 , the first order term will be pointing inward and bigger than the curvature term , thus forcing the solution to have a finite time singularity at the origin ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is the content of the next theorem .",
    "[ example ] when @xmath137 , the lagrangian mean curvature flow starting at @xmath24 develops a finite time singularity at the origin .",
    "the tangent flow is a union of two planes intersecting at a single point , both with lagrangian angle @xmath138 .",
    "we start by proving short - time existence for the equivariant mean curvature flow .",
    "the procedure is well - know among the specialists but we include it here for the sake of completeness .    after rotating the coordinate axis by @xmath139",
    ", the curve @xmath135 can be written as the graph of a function @xmath140 over the real axis .",
    "a straightforward computation shows the existence of some constant @xmath141 such that @xmath142 , consider graphical solutions @xmath143 for the equivariant mean curvature flow with boundary conditions @xmath144 we will show uniform apriori @xmath145-estimates for the sequence of functions @xmath146 .",
    "a simple computation reveals that @xmath147 solves the quasilinear equation @xmath148    [ max ] there exists positive @xmath149 and @xmath16 so that @xmath150 for all @xmath151 and all @xmath152 .",
    "moreover , we have for all @xmath151 that @xmath153    consider a solution @xmath154 to having initial condition a circle of small radius centered at the origin that does not intersect @xmath135 .",
    "the maximum principle implies that the graph of @xmath147 can not intersect @xmath155 and so the first assertion follows .",
    "the second assertion also follows from the maximum principle because @xmath156 and @xmath140 are a solution and supersolution for respectively .",

    "hence , the maximum principle implies that @xmath160 is uniformly bounded for all @xmath161 .",
    "moreover , we obtain from lemma [ max ] that @xmath162 and so , it follows from that @xmath163 converges to zero as @xmath6 goes to infinity .",
    "because @xmath164 satisfies an evolution equation of the form @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are uniformly bounded functions , we obtain from the maximum principle that @xmath168 is uniformly bounded .",
    "standard theory for quasilinear parabolic equations implies the existence of some constant @xmath2 for which @xmath169 for all @xmath151",
    ". therefore , we can let @xmath6 go to infinity and obtain a solution @xmath170 for the equivariant mean curvature flow .",
    "next , we argue that the flow @xmath171 develops a finite time singularity .",
    "we need the following lemma .",

    "the second identity can be checked using @xmath183    let @xmath184 denote the area of the triangular - shaped region @xmath185 note that @xmath186 and that @xmath187 because @xmath188 therefore , @xmath189 because @xmath16 can be chosen arbitrarily small , the flow must develop a finite time singularity if @xmath137 .",

    "we need to show that the singularity occurs at the origin .",
