    "the equations of motion for a spinning test particle in a given gravitational background resulting in the so called mathisson - papapetrou model @xcite are rather difficult to solve even for highly symmetric spacetimes . trying to obtain solutions which describe particle motion along killing trajectories ( like circular orbits , for example )",
    "is in general too restrictive to yield nontrivial solutions since the forces associated with the nongeodesic motion complicate matters @xcite .",
    "however , implicit in the model is the requirement that the spin structure of the particle should produce very small deviations from geodesic motion in the sense that the length scale naturally associated with the spin should be very small compared to the one associated with the curvature tensor of the spacetime itself .",
    "if this were not the case , one would have to take into account the particle back reaction on the spacetime metric , i.e. , approach the problem from a completely different point of view .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to make some progress towards understanding the consequences of the model by introducing the condition of  small spin \" from the very beginning , resulting in a simplified set of linearized differential equations which can be easily integrated as shown below .",
    "this approach allows an analytic discussion of the problem in complete generality in this limit , which can be compared with the previous numerical studies of the full nonlinear equations @xcite .",
    "one finds that the general solution of the linearized equations of motion corresponds to an adjustment of constants of the motion for the stable oscillations of the nearby geodesics about a new equilibrium circular orbit due to the additional radial component of the spin force arising from the constant spin component out of the equatorial plane .",
    "this new equilibrium orbit has a slightly adjusted azimuthal velocity to balance this radial spin force and a slightly adjusted radius .",
    "the spin component in the equatorial plane ( boosted to the local rest space of the world line ) undergoes a simple rotation corresponding to parallel transport along the original circular geodesic and induces an oscillation of the particle path in and out of the equatorial plane adding to the geodesic oscillations already present .",
    "let us briefly recall the mathisson and papapetrou model , which uses a `` center of mass line '' for the spinning particle to perform a multipole reduction .",
    "let @xmath0 be the timelike unit tangent vector to this world line , parametrized by the proper time @xmath1 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total 4-momentum of the particle and @xmath4 is its antisymmetric ( intrinsic angular momentum ) spin tensor , both fields defined only along this center of mass world line .",
    "this system of 10 equations evolve @xmath5 and @xmath6 along this world line but contain 13 unknown quantities : @xmath7 ( 3 ) , @xmath5 ( 4 ) , @xmath6 ( 6 ) . in order for the model to be consistent , the above equations of motion must be completed with the dixon - tulczyjew @xcite supplementary conditions [ tconds ] s^p_=0 , under which the trajectory of the extended body is determined by the position of the center of mass of the body itself .",
    "other possible choices of supplementary conditions will not be considered here . the present model with these supplementary conditions",
    "will be referred to as the mathisson - papapetrou - dixon model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there exists a wide literature in which the lagrangian formulation is used to study spinning particle motion , including the interaction with external fields as well ( see e.g. @xcite ) . furthermore , it is possible to obtain the mathisson - papapetrou - dixon equations ( [ papcoreqs1])([tconds ] ) directly from the dirac equation by taking a proper limit through the wkb approximation , as shown e.g. in @xcite .    contracting both sides of eq .",
    "( [ papcoreqs2 ] ) with @xmath8 , one obtains the following expression linking the total 4-momentum to the 4-velocity and spin tensor derivative @xmath9 where the quantity @xmath10 is a convenient definition which reduces to the ordinary ( constant ) particle mass when the spin vanishes . contracting this momentum relation instead with @xmath11 yields @xmath12    by contracting both sides of eq .",

( [ pnorm ] ) . neglecting these second order terms leaves the relation @xmath15 valid to first order in the spin , which implies that @xmath5 and @xmath7 are parallel in this limit : @xmath16 .",
    "the projection of the spin tensor into the local rest space of @xmath7 ( i.e. , the subspace of the tangent space orthogonal to @xmath7 ) defines the spin vector by spatial duality [ spinvec ] s^=12 _ ^u^s_=u^_^,s_=_u^s^ , where @xmath17 is the unit volume 4-form and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the levi - civita alternating symbol .",

    "the requirement which is essential to the validity of the mathisson - papapetrou - dixon model and the test particle approach is that the characteristic length scale @xmath23 associated with the particle s internal structure be small compared to the natural length scale @xmath24 ( say ) associated with the background field @xcite .",

    "we have also shown that during its motion the orbit of the spinning particle has a radial component which oscillates in a circular ring either inside or outside the geodesic radius depending on the relative sign of the vertical component of the spin and the orbital velocity .",
    "the azimuthal motion also oscillates around the geodesic value with the same frequency characterizing the radial motion , apart from a secular drift which occurs at slightly different speeds for the inner and outer radial oscillations .",
    "the @xmath148 motion is instead characterized by the superposition of two frequencies , one the same as in both the horizontal motion , and the other governing the oscillations of the spin vector ; the result is a harmonic oscillation at the orbital frequency , modulated by a beat frequency .",
    "thus the orbit is confined to a tube inside or outside the initial circular orbit at the radius @xmath111 .    if the spin of the particle is initially aligned along the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane ( @xmath144 ) the tube collapses to a flat ( horizontal ) circular corona .",
    "if the spin is initially horizontal ( @xmath150 ) , then the tube collapses to a flat vertical band .",
    "finally , an interesting consequence of this analysis is that the spin of the test particle leads to a small spread in its position compared to a spinless particle following the same circular geodesic . in other words without precise knowledge of the initial orientation of the spin",
    "when the test particle has the initial data of the corresponding circular geodesic , it can be found somewhere within a small neighborhood of that geodesic within the limits to the oscillating deviations in the three independent directions , modulo a small secular drift in the azimuthal direction which stretches out the two halves of this ellipsoid in opposite azimuthal directions .",

    "<S> the deviation of the path of a spinning particle from a circular geodesic in the schwarzschild spacetime is studied by an extension of the idea of geodesic deviation . within the mathisson - papapetrou - dixon model and assuming the spin parameter to be sufficiently small so that it makes sense to linearize the equations of motion in the spin variables as well as in the geodesic deviation , the spin - curvature force adds an additional driving term to the second order system of linear ordinary differential equations satisfied by nearby geodesics . </S>",
    "<S> choosing initial conditions for geodesic motion leads to solutions for which the deviations are entirely due to the spin - curvature force , and one finds that the spinning particle position for a given fixed total spin oscillates roughly within an ellipse in the plane perpendicular to the motion , while the azimuthal motion undergoes similar oscillations plus an additional secular drift which varies with spin orientation . </S>"
