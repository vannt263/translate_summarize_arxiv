    "the fukushima dai - ichi npp accident  @xcite contaminated the soil of densely - populated regions of fukushima prefecture with radioactive cesium , which poses risks of internal ( and external ) exposures to the residents .",
    "if we apply the knowledge of post - chernobyl accident studies  @xcite , internal exposures in excess of several msv y@xmath1 would be expected to be frequent in fukushima .",
    "extensive whole - body - counter surveys of 21,785 residents in highly - affected fukushima municipalities , however , showed that their actual internal exposure levels are much lower than estimated  @xcite ; in 20122013 , the @xmath0cs detection percentages ( the detection limit being @xmath2 bq / body ) are about 1% for adults , and practically 0% for children ( age 615 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with those of many other measurements and studies conducted so far in fukushima , e.g. , dose assessment  @xcite , rice inspection  @xcite , foodstuff screening and duplicate - portion studies  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there continue to be many residents , families with small children in particular , who are very much concerned about internal exposures .",
    "this is in part due to the fact the whole body counters currently being used in fukushima , such as the fastscan  @xcite , are designed for radiation workers , who are adults .",
    "children have been successfully measured previously at chernobyl , and in fukushima prefecture , by having them stand on a small stool to get their bodies into the detection zone . while this is suitable to measure larger uptakes in larger children , it is not optimum for measuring small children ( @xmath3 y ) , and is not suitable for infants or children who can not stand .",
    "scientifically , it is sufficient to measure parents , but worried parents strongly request to have their babies measured .",
    "we therefore launched a project in the spring of 2013  @xcite to develop a whole body counter for small children called a `` babyscan '' , and have installed the first unit at the hirata central hospital in fukushima prefecture in december 2013 .",
    "the design principles , implementation and the initial operating experience are reported .",
    "about 80% of some 60 whole body counters currently installed in fukushima prefecture are canberra s fastscan .",
    "a subject stands for two minutes in a shielding box made of iron , which houses two @xmath4 cm sodium iodide ( nai ) gamma - ray detectors .",
    "the detection limit for radioactive cesium is about 250 - 300 bq / body ( both for @xmath5cs and @xmath0cs ) , which is nearly independent of height and/or weight of the adult subject ( flat within @xmath6 ) .",
    "this detection limit is however too high for reliably measuring small children , since the biological half - life of radioactive cesium in children ( @xmath7 days for 1-year old , @xmath8 days for 5-year old ) is much shorter than that in adults ( @xmath9 days )  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "children s internal contamination is harder to detect .",
    "for example , if an adult ingested 3 bq of @xmath0cs every day , the body burden would reach an equilibrium plateau of @xmath10  bq / body  @xcite .",
    "this can be detected by the fastscan .",
    "if on the other hand a 1-year - old child ingested the same amount , the resultant body burden would be @xmath11bq / body .",
    "therefore , the whole body counters for babies must have a much lower detection limit .",
    "our goal was to achieve a detection limit of @xmath12 bq / body for @xmath13cs . in order to realize this high sensitivity ,",
    "the babyscan must be ergonomically designed so that a small child can stay still for several minutes , without feeling afraid of confinement .    from the beginning",
    ", it was recognized that the babyscan s design must be reassuring to parents , and that in addition to being a measurement device , it would be expected to play an important role as a communication tool to facilitate interactions between medical staff and residents .",
    "the babyscan s design principles and technologies were derived from those of fastscan , but in order to realize higher sensitivity , there are some crucial differences .    as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cutaway ] , the subject lies down inside the measurement chamber of babyscan , as opposed to standing as in the case of fastscan .",
    "a child can either lie on the bed supine ( on their back and face up ) , or prone ( on their stomach , face down ) . during development",
    ", we discovered that older children s posture tends to be more stable in the prone position , as shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cutaway ] .",
    "small babies , however , tend to prefer the supine position , and are more comfortable when they can also see their mother s face through the opening .",
    "both positions are ok , as they have essentially the same efficiency .",
    "there are four nai detectors ( @xmath4 cm each ) , arranged in a two - by - two geometry , installed in an iron - shielded compartment placed above the subject .",
    "the bottom of the nai compartment has a window facing the subject , made of a carbon - honeycomb plate measuring 28 cm @xmath14 86 cm .",
    "the detectors are close to each other , therefore the area of the nai group of detectors is approximately 26 cm @xmath14 82 cm .",
    "this is similar to the size of a small child , thereby achieving a high gamma - ray detection efficiency .",
    ".[tab : param]babyscan parameters [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]      comparison of the @xmath0cs 6-year - old phantom spectra .",
    "black : babyscan 4-minutes , gray : fastscan 2-minutes . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] shows the spectra of the 6-year - old phantom ( 6226 bq of @xmath0cs ) measured with the babyscan ( 4-minutes , shown in black ) and the fastscan ( 2-minutes , shown in gray ) ; they are installed in the same room of the hospital .",
    "the @xmath0cs peak count of babyscan is about 8 times larger as compared to the fastscan . from the increase in the number of detectors ( @xmath15 ) and in the measurement time ( @xmath15 )",
    ", one would navely expect an increase of factor 4 ; the extra factor of 2 comes from the closer subject - detector distance than in the fastscan , and because the detectors are closer to each other than in the fastscan detector geometry .",
    "the cs - region background count of babyscan is about 3.5 times higher than that of fastscan , which is 13% smaller than the factor 4 expected from the differences in both the number of detectors and the measurement time .",
    "this 13% background reduction ( despite a rather large opening at the top ) is the result of the increased shielding .",

    "height vs weight of the subjects . ]",
    "the first babyscan unit , installed at the hirata central hospital in fukushima prefecture , started operation on december 2 , 2013 .",
    "we here demonstrate its performance based on the data of first 100 subjects , whose age distribution ( minimum 3.8 months old , maximum 10 year old , mean 4.2 year old ) is shown in fig .",

    "radiocesium was not detected in any of the 100 subjects , and the mothers were happy to learn the test results .",
    "nevertheless , as expected , @xmath16k was detected in all subjects .",
    "typical gamma - ray energy spectra are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ; the spectra shown in black dots were taken with subjects ( 4 minutes ) , and those shown in gray dots were taken without subject ( measured for 5 hours , normalized to 4 minutes ) .",
    "a statistically - significant @xmath16k peak was found in each of the background - subtracted spectrum ( open circles ) .",
    "[ fig : k40 ] shows the distribution of the @xmath16k activity ( bq / body ) vs the weight of the subject .",
    "the data shown in open circles / filled circles / open squares were measured with the 20-cm/25-cm/30-cm bed . the data points show a linear correlation between the weight and the amount of @xmath16k in the body , with a slope of @xmath17 bq kg@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the known amount of @xmath16k in human body .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig : k40 ] indicates that @xmath16k activities as low as 300 bq were reliably detected , and accurately measured .",
    "one can use this information , to estimate the amount of @xmath0cs that can be reliably measured .",
    "the gamma yield of @xmath0cs is 85% while the gamma yield of @xmath16k is only 10% .",
    "the @xmath0cs background [ counts per kev ] is 3 times the background of @xmath16k , but the detector full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for @xmath0cs is 0.6 times that of the @xmath16k .",
    "the efficiency at @xmath0cs energies is 1.4 times larger than at @xmath16k .",
    "these combine to convert a reliably measured 300 bq @xmath16k value into an estimated 35 bq @xmath0cs value that should be reliably measured , all other things being equal .",
    "this is consistent with the calculated @xmath0cs mda described in the next paragraph .    the minimum detectable activity ( mda )  @xcite for @xmath0cs ( bq / body ) , calculated for each subject , is plotted in fig .  [ fig : mda ] against weight ( kg ) .",
    "here again , data taken with 20-cm/25-cm/30-cm beds are shown in open circles / filled circles / open squares .",
    "as the bed - to - detector distance decreases , the solid angle increases and hence the mda decreases .",
    "this plot clearly shows that our initial goal of achieving a detection limit lower than 50 bq / body has been met .    the minimum detectable activity ( mda ) for @xmath0cs ( bq / body ) vs subjects weight .",
    "babyscan , a whole body counter for small children was developed , and the first unit has been installed at a hospital in fukushima . the radiocesium detection limit of babyscan is better than 50 bq / body , which has been realized by a careful ergonomic design , optimized detector geometry and reinforced shielding . even with this low detection limit , radiocesium was not detected in any of the first 100 fukushima children , while , as expected , @xmath16k was detected in all subjects .",
    "the results of larger - scale measurements with the babyscan will be reported in our forthcoming publications .",
    "the authors would like to express their appreciation to kinya tagawa and hisato ogata of takram design engineering for their assistance in the design of babyscan .",
