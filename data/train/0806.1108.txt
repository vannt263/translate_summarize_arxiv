    "there are several salient features of the charmless three - body baryonic @xmath0 decays @xmath11 with @xmath12 being a baryon .",
    "first , a peak near the threshold area of the dibaryon invariant mass spectrum has been observed in many baryonic @xmath0 decays @xcite .",
    "the so - called threshold effect indicates that the @xmath0 meson is preferred to decay into a baryon - antibaryon pair with low invariant mass accompanied by a fast recoil meson .",
    "second , none of the two - body charmless baryonic @xmath0 decays has been observed so far and the present limit on their branching ratios has been pushed to the level of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this means that three - body final states usually have rates larger than their two - body counterparts ; that is , @xmath14 .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in terms of the threshold effect , namely , the invariant mass of the dibaryon is preferred to be close to the threshold ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the configuration of the two - body decay @xmath15 is not favorable since its invariant mass is @xmath16 . in @xmath11",
    "decays , the effective mass of the baryon pair is reduced as the emitted meson can carry away a large amount of the energies released in baryonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "third , in the dibaryon rest frame the outgoing meson tends to have a correlation with the baryon or the antibaryon .",
    "experimentally , the correlation can be studied by measuring the dalitz plot asymmetry or the angular distribution of the baryon or the antibaryon in the dibaryon rest frame .",
    "for example , the proton in the dibaryon rest frame of @xmath17 is found to prefer to move collinearly with its meson partner @xcite , whereas the proton and @xmath18 in @xmath19 move back to back most of the time @xcite .    while various theoretical ideas @xcite have been put forward to explain the low mass threshold enhancement , this effect",
    "can be understood in terms of a simple short - distance picture @xcite .",
    "one energetic @xmath20 pair must be emitted back to back by a hard gluon in order to produce a baryon and an antibaryon in the two - body decay .",
    "this hard gluon is highly off mass shell and hence the two - body decay amplitude is suppressed by order of @xmath21 . in the three - body baryonic @xmath0 decays , a possible configuration is that the @xmath22 pair is emitted collinearly against the meson .",
    "the quark and antiquark pair emitted from a gluon is moving nearly in the same direction .",
    "since this gluon is close to its mass shell , the corresponding configuration is not subject to the short - distance suppression .",
    "this implies that the dibaryon pair tends to have a small invariant mass .",
    "while the above - mentioned short - distance picture predicts a correct angular distribution pattern for the decays @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 @xcite , it fails to explain the angular correlation observed in @xmath26 @xcite and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the intuitive argument that the @xmath28 in the @xmath29 rest frame is expected to emerge parallel to @xmath30 is not borne out by experiment @xcite .",
    "likewise , the naive argument that the pion has no preference for its correlation with the @xmath31 or the @xmath32 in the decay @xmath27 is ruled out by the new belle experiment @xcite in which a strong correlation between the @xmath31 and the pion is seen .",
    "therefore , although the short - distance picture appears to describe the global features of the three - body baryonic @xmath0 decays , it can not explain the angular correlation enigma encountered in the penguin - dominated processes @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the study of the charmful baryonic @xmath0 decays @xmath33 may help improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism for the threshold enhancement and the angular distribution in three - body decays .",
    "first , the aforementioned three features also manifest themselves in @xmath34 .",
    "an enhancement at the low dibaryon mass has been seen , for example , in the decay @xmath35 @xcite , while the dalitz plot of @xmath35 @xcite with asymmetric distributions signals a nonzero angular distribution asymmetry .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 is a mirror reflecting the phenomena observed in @xmath11 .",
    "second , since the decay rates of @xmath34 are 10 - 1000 times larger than that of @xmath11 , in principle this will render the detection of angular distributions and dalitz asymmetries in the latter easier .",
    "theoretically , the relevant topologic quark diagrams for charmful decays are simpler than the charmless ones as the latter receive not only tree but also penguin contributions . in this work",
    ", we shall therefore focus on @xmath36 with @xmath37 or @xmath2 , and our first task is to see if we can explain the branching fractions .",

    "we have @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "note that since numerically @xmath142 , we thus have @xmath143 as the ratio @xmath144 is close to 1 . for heavy dibaryons , the ratio @xmath145 will become larger , for example , @xmath146 ^ 2=4.2 $ ] . among the current - type modes listed in table [ tab :",

    "note that the experimental studies of the angular distributions in the charmful cases may help solve the angular correlation puzzle in @xmath149 owing to the same @xmath104 transition form factors appearing in both cases .",
    "similar to the charmless cases of @xmath150 and @xmath151 @xcite , the decay rate of the class - ii decay @xmath44 is dominated by the form factors @xmath152 and @xmath153 defined in eq .",
    "( [ transitionf ] ) .",
    "contrary to the @xmath154 production , the decay @xmath155 receives contributions from the form factors @xmath156 and @xmath157 accompanied by @xmath158 .",
    "considering the dibaryon in the nonrelativistic limit , the ratio of the amplitudes reads @xmath159 this ratio is expected to be of the order of unity since @xmath160 and @xmath161 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) are of the same order , and so are @xmath153 and @xmath157 terms .",
    "class - iii decays will have rates larger than class - i and class - ii ones if the relative phase between @xmath107 and @xmath108 is small so that their interference is constructive .",

    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : r3 ] .",
    "for example , @xmath164 which are larger than @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively , by a factor of 3 . it will be interesting to test this experimentally .    as seen in table [ r4 ] and [ r5 ] , for the baryonic decays with a @xmath167 in the final state ,",
    "our prediction @xmath168 is consistent with the belle limit , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 is in accordance with the babar limit but slightly higher than the upper bound set by belle [ see eq . ( [ decay2 ] ) for the data ] .",
    "we also find that the decays @xmath171 have branching fractions of order @xmath172 .",
    "as for the threshold peaking effect , while it manifests in the decay @xmath4 the data clearly do not show the threshold behavior in @xmath173 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_threshold ] ) .",
    "this can be understood as follows . in the latter decay ,",
    "the invariant mass @xmath174 ranges from 2.05 to 2.18 gev , which is very narrow compared to the @xmath175 range in the @xmath4 decay .",
    "consequently , the invariant mass distribution of @xmath176 is governed by the shape of the phase space due to the relative flat @xmath177 dependence within the small allowed @xmath174 region .",
    "finally we notice that since the transition - type decays share the same @xmath178 transition form factors with @xmath179 , @xmath26 and @xmath180 , measurements for distributions / daltiz plot asymmetries are useful for solving the puzzle of the angular distributions in the charmless baryonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "for example , a recent dalitz plot analysis of @xmath4 by babar @xcite shows a possible indication that @xmath181 where the angular asymmetry @xmath182 is defined by @xcite @xmath183 which is equal to @xmath184 , where @xmath185 are the events with @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively . the above relation ( [ appd ] )",
