    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we construct six - quark local interpolating currents for @xmath2 without derivative operators .",
    "local interpolating fields for dibaryons consisting of six quarks can be generally described as @xmath11 where @xmath12 are color indices , @xmath13 are flavor indices , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are used to denote their internal color and flavor structures , respectively ; @xmath16 is the flavor triplet quark field at location @xmath17 ; the superscript @xmath18 represents the transpose of the dirac indices only ; and @xmath19 is the charge - conjugation operator . in this paper",
    "we also use the following notations : @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are the gell - mann matrices , @xmath22 is the totally anti - symmetric tensor , and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are the normalized totally symmetric matrices .      the local color - singlet baryon fields without derivatives have been systematically studied and classified in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we found that there are altogether six independent baryon fields , including one flavor - singlet , three flavor - octet and two flavor - decuplet baryon fields . among these fields ,",
    "three of them do not have any free lorentz indices : @xmath40 two of them have one free lorentz index : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and only one of them has two anti - symmetric free lorentz indices : @xmath43 where @xmath44 we note that they all have a positive parity , except @xmath45 .",
    "the baryon fields with a negative parity can be obtained simply by inserting an extra @xmath46 .",
    "we can now use these color - singlet baryon fields to construct the dibaryon interpolating fields .",
    "the @xmath47 dibaryon field without derivatives can be generally written as @xmath48 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 denotes symmetrization and subtracting the trace terms in the sets @xmath50 , and @xmath51 result in dibaryon interpolating fields containing @xmath47 components .",
    "we note that these operators can contain more than three free lorentz indices .",
    "a familiar example is the electromagnetic field @xmath52 which has two antisymmetric lorentz indices but has spin only 1 .",
    "to construct such a dibaryon field : ( a ) the matrix between two baryon fields , @xmath53 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : color2 ] ) , should contain either one free lorentz index @xmath54 , or two anti - symmetric lorentz indices @xmath55 ; ( b)additionally , we need two extra symmetric lorentz indices .",
    "we find the following four currents containing @xmath47 components : @xmath56 and the following four currents containing @xmath57 components , i.e. , both @xmath47 and @xmath58 components : @xmath59 in ref .",
    "@xcite all these baryon fields were used to perform qcd sum rule analyses .",
    "the results showed that only sum rules from @xmath60 are reasonable .",
    "furthermore , the mass sum rules from @xmath61 are unphysical ( the spectral density is negative in the physical region ) while those from @xmath45 are too trival to give reliable results .",
    "hence , @xmath62 and @xmath63 may be good candidates for qcd sum rule studies .",
    "however , the latter current contains both @xmath64 and @xmath65 components , so we shall use the former one for the @xmath2 . considering isospin symmetry , we therefore choose the following @xmath10 like dibaryon interpolating field to perform qcd sum rule analyses in the next section : @xmath66 = \\mathcal{s } [ \\epsilon_{abc } \\epsilon_{def } ( u^{at } c \\gamma_{\\alpha_1 } u^b ) u^{ct } c \\gamma_{\\alpha_3 } d^f ( d^{dt } c \\gamma_{\\alpha_2 } d^e ) ] \\ , .",

    "\\label{eq : deltadelta3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by doing this we shall have investigated all the local @xmath64 dibaryon currents of color - singlet - color - singlet @xmath10 type . however , we note that there are still many other dibaryon fields with @xmath0 , such as the @xmath69-@xmath70 type current @xmath71 and many other color - octet - color - octet currents and non - local currents . however , our primary interest is exploration of the @xmath10 scenarios , and hence these additional currents are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we assume @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) couples to the @xmath2 with @xmath0 through @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the decay constant ; @xmath76 is the symmetric and traceless polarization tensor , which has the following properties at the leading order ( only counting @xmath77 ) : @xmath78 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 denotes symmetrization and subtracting the trace terms in the sets @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "qcd sum rule techniques have proven to be a powerful and successful non - perturbative method over the past few decades  @xcite . in sum rule analyses ,",
    "we consider the following two - point correlation function : @xmath82 \\pi(q^2 ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and compute @xmath83 in the qcd operator product expansion ( ope ) up to certain order in the expansion .",
    "the result is then matched with a hadronic parametrization to extract information about hadron properties . at the hadron level",
    ", we express the correlation function in the form of the dispersion relation with a spectral function : @xmath84 where the integration starts from the physical threshold .",
    "the imaginary part of the two - point correlation function is @xmath85 as usual , we adopt a parametrization of one pole dominance for the ground state @xmath2 and a continuum contribution .",
    "the sum rule analysis is then performed after the borel transformation of the two correlation function expressions ( [ def : pi ] ) and ( [ eq : disper ] ) @xmath86 assuming the contribution from the continuum states can be approximated well by the ope spectral density above a threshold value @xmath87 ( duality ) , we arrive at the sum rule relation for the @xmath2 .",
    "the sum rule for the first current @xmath88 is @xmath89 and the one using the second current @xmath90 is @xmath91 the sum rule for the third current @xmath92 is identical to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule1 ] ) obtained for the first current .",
    "this may suggest that @xmath88 and @xmath92 can be related to each other , or the equivalence of the sum - rules may only exist at leading - order .",
    "moreover , we shall see in the following discussions that the results obtained by using @xmath88 and @xmath90 are also quite similar .",
    "we discuss the results obtained from the first current @xmath88 in detail , and simply show the results obtained from @xmath90 .    in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sumrule2 ] ) the chirally - suppressed contributions from current quark masses are neglected because they are numerically insignificant .",
    "moreover , the terms containing quark - related condensates in ope are found to be significantly larger than those containing gluon - related condensates . in our calculation , we consider only leading order contributions from the two - gluon condensate ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "we would like to note that we have used the _ mathematica _ @xmath94 package  @xcite to calculate the ope .",
    "we have calculated the correlation function up to dimension 16 to make sure that the convergence of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sumrule2 ] ) is sufficient for a reliable qcd sum rule .",
    "to study this convergence , we use the following values for various condensates  @xcite : @xmath95 and numerically show @xmath96 for @xmath97 : @xmath98 eq .",
    "shows that the ope convergence improves with increasing @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , we will work at the borel mass region @xmath1002.2 gev@xmath101 in our analysis to ensure that the perturbative contribution is the dominant contribution . in this region ,",
    "the dimension six and dimension eight condensates become significant to satisfy the ope convergence . in the following",
    ", we shall calculate the mass of the @xmath2 with @xmath87 around 6 gev@xmath101 .",
    "another criterion of qcd sum rule is the pole contribution @xmath102 however , it is only about 0.0002 when @xmath103 gev@xmath101 and @xmath104 gev@xmath101 . we can not increase it to be larger than 0.01 in a wide region of 3 gev@xmath105 gev@xmath101 and 5 gev@xmath106 gev@xmath101 .",
    "this is similar to other sum - rule analyses with multi - quark states , the pole contribution is small because of the large powers of @xmath107 in the spectral function . in the following analyses , we find reasonable regions for the borel mass @xmath99 and the threshold value @xmath87 , in which the final results are stable against these two free parameters .",
    "our final expression for the mass of the @xmath2 is @xmath108 in the fig .",
    "[ fig : current1]a we first show the variations of @xmath109 with respect to the threshold value @xmath87 , in a large region 3 gev@xmath110 gev@xmath101 and @xmath111 gev@xmath101 .",
    "it shows that the obtained mass decreases monotonically and quickly with @xmath112 from 3 gev@xmath101 to 7 gev@xmath101 .",
    "however , the dependence of our results on @xmath112 becomes much weaker as @xmath112 continues increasing from 7 gev@xmath101 .",
    "all these curves have a mass minimum in a similar region when @xmath87 is around 5.5 gev@xmath101 .",
    "hence , the @xmath87 dependence of the mass prediction is also weak at this point .",
    "accordingly , we use the following parameters as our working region : @xmath113 and obtain the mass of the @xmath2 to be @xmath114 where the error @xmath115 gev originates from the uncertainties in the borel mass @xmath99 , continuum threshold @xmath87 and the various condensates shown in eqs .",
    "( [ condensates ] ) .",
    "the dominant error source in our analysis is the uncertainty of quark condensate .",
    "we also evaluate the decay constant @xmath116 to be : @xmath117 which gives the coupling between the interpolating operator and the physical state ( the uncertainty in the coupling is based upon the same sources considered for the mass ) .",
    "this value of the coupling is needed to calculate hadronic decay width of the physical state in the three - point function sum rules ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "moreover , we find that the curves start to fluctuate merge when @xmath112 is larger than about 50 gev@xmath101 , which means that the variation of the hadron mass with the borel parameter @xmath112 is very small in this region .",
    "therefore , we find a lower bound on the @xmath2 mass of @xmath4 gev . for completeness , we also show the variations of @xmath109 with respect to the borel mass @xmath112 in the fig .",
    "[ fig : current1]b , again in a large region 3 gev@xmath118 gev@xmath101 and for @xmath119 gev@xmath101 , again illustrating that the dependence of our results on @xmath112 becomes much weaker when @xmath112 is larger than 7 gev@xmath101 .",
    "similarly , we use the second current @xmath90 to perform the qcd sum rule analyses .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : current2 ] are quite similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : current1 ] obtained by using the first current @xmath88 .",
    "we obtain the mass of the @xmath2 to be @xmath114 and the decay constant @xmath120 to be : @xmath121",
    "in the previous section we used three single @xmath10 type dibaryon interpolating field , @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , and performed the qcd sum rule analyses . because the first and the third currents lead to identical sum rules , here we only study the mixing current constructed from the first and the second ones , which can be written as : @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are two real mixing parameters . using this mixed current",
    ", we arrive at the following sum rule : @xmath125 after performing numerical analysis , we find that as long as the borel transformed two - point correlation function @xmath126 is positive in our working region @xmath87 around @xmath127 gev@xmath101 , the results are also quite similar : we obtain the same mass of the @xmath2 of @xmath3 gev",
    ". therefore , we arrive at the conclusion that the mixing of @xmath10 like local dibaryon currents does not change our previous conclusion significantly .",
    "in summary , we have systematically constructed @xmath0 six - quark local interpolating currents without derivatives .",
    "we have presented arguments for selecting three @xmath10 like operators to perform qcd sum rule analyses and calculated the mass of the @xmath2 .",
    "the ope was calculated up to dimension 16 and we verified that its convergence is acceptable.the mass predictions are stable under variations in the two sum - rule parameters in the following regions @xmath128 the sum - rule prediction of the @xmath2 mass is @xmath3 gev and its corresponding decay constant is @xmath129 gev@xmath130 and @xmath131 gev@xmath130 . our result is consistent with the experimental value of the @xmath2 mass  @xcite .",
    "we also obtained a lower bound of @xmath4 gev for the @xmath2 mass . considering the dibaryon current used in this paper is a @xmath10 like current , where two @xmath1 s are both color singlets ( see eqs .",
    "- ) , this result may suggest that the @xmath10 bound state has a binding energy less than 220 mev . to ensure that our conclusions are not significantly influenced by the choice of interpolating current , we mix these @xmath10 dibaryon operators , and",
    "calculate the two - point correlation using this mixed interpolating current and then perform the qcd sum rule analysis to extract the mass of the @xmath2 and its lower mass bound .",
    "the numerical results show that this mixing effect does not change our previous conclusion for the @xmath2 .    however , all the dibaryon currents discussed in this paper are local currents without derivatives .",
    "this makes it challenging to determine whether the @xmath2 is a @xmath8 bound state or a six - quark state with hidden - color configurations , because we can always use the fierz transformation to change a color - octet - color - octet structure to be a combination of color - singlet - color - singlet structures ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : color1 ] ) and ( [ eq : color2 ] ) ) , and vice versa . to discriminate between them in the qcd sum rule",
