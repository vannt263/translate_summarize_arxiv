    "the eastern longitude extremum is formed by sgr b2 .",
    "they propose that the collision of orbit systems at the extrema give rise to strong shocks , driving enhanced star formation .",
    "given the prolific star formation rate of sgr b2 , sgr c must be examined more closely to understand the observed asymmetry in the cmz .    the first evidence of high mass star formation in the sgr c cloud was reported by  @xcite , who detected a faint 8 - 9 ghz radio source measuring 0.06 @xmath5 0.01 pc near its tip . using data from the spitzer galcen survey  @xcite ,",

    "we note that the measured velocities also allow this site to be associated with the 3 kpc arm at 5.5 kpc , however linewidths and widespread sio emission indicate a likely distance of 8.5 kpc . the cloud harbours @xmath010@xmath8",
    "m@xmath4  of gas and dust with typical column densities of @xmath2010@xmath46 @xmath7 and temperatures of 19 - 25 k. it shows no evidence of further star formation activity despite presenting suitable physical conditions .",
    "the presence of three star - forming cores in the ego contrasts with the absence of further star formation in the host molecular cloud , placing sgr c at an interesting mid - point between the quiescent g0.253 and starburst - like sgr b2 .",
    "the driving and inhibiting forces at work in the cmz clouds and the relevance of their location along the proposed 100-pc elliptical ring are fascinating open questions ."
