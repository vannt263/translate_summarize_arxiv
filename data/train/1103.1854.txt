    "dissipation is usually modeled by coupling a _ central system _ to an external _ environment_. the environment can be represented by an infinite collection of modes ( either harmonic or spin - like ) at a given temperature , or by few chaotic degrees of freedom .",
    "models in the first category include the caldeira  leggett ( cl ) @xcite , where the environment is represented by @xmath0 harmonic oscillators with a linear distribution of frequencies . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath2 ,",
    "the central system obeys the classical langevin equation , exhibiting exponential dissipation subjected to fluctuating forces .    in the case of small environments ,",
    "the exchange of energy with the central system exhibits large fluctuations and equilibration is achieved only after averaging over an ensemble of realizations , usually of the micro - canonical type .",
    "wilkinson @xcite , and later berry and robbins @xcite , studied the coupling of a fast chaotic environment to a slow central system using the properties of adiabatic invariants .",
    "they showed that the adiabatic invariance of the chaotic energy shell @xcite leads , in first order , to a born - oppenheimer conservative type of reaction on the central system .",
    "second order corrections lead to a force proportional to the velocity whose symmetric part corresponds to friction and whose antisymmetric part acts as a geometric magnetism @xcite . since the publication of these pioneering works , a large number of papers has explored the possibility of dissipation caused by small environments , both classically @xcite and quantum mechanically @xcite , where decoherence is the main focus .",
    "although the approach to dissipation via ensemble average over small environments has lead to several interesting results , it can not account for situations where a single experiment is performed and no averages take place .",
    "this is , for example , the case of the @xmath3 molecule interacting with its own internal degrees of freedom . as pointed out in @xcite , couplings of these molecules to the environment or to their own internal degrees of freedom play an essential role in the appearance of decoherence , destroying self - interferences in a double slit experiment , and deserve a careful analysis .",
    "when the environment has relatively few degrees of freedom it is not clear whether they lead to standard dissipation effects over the collective degrees of freedom .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study dissipation from the classical point of view as induced by small environments without resorting to ensemble averages . to distinguish this process from those obtained after averaging , we term it _",
    "effective dissipation_. we follow the general approach of feynman and vernon @xcite where the system of interest , or _ central system _ , has much fewer degrees of freedom than the environment , which , however , is also small . in our simulations",
    "the central system is a harmonic oscillator with a single degree of freedom whereas the environment has @xmath4 freedoms .",
    "we study the system as a function of @xmath0 and of its dynamical character , regular or chaotic .",
    "we wish to determine the minimum value of @xmath0 for which the environment behaves as a thermal bath , inducing irreversible dissipation on the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we consider a globally conservative system governed by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 \\equiv \\sum_{n=1}^{n } h_{cn } , \\label{eq : quartic system}\\\\ v_{i } & = & \\sum_{n=1}^{n}qx_{n}. \\label{eq : coupling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the environment @xmath7 is modeled by the finite sum of identical quartic systems ( qs ) @xcite .",
    "each qs has two degrees of freedom and is invariant under a scaling transformation in such a way that the dynamics in all energy shells are the same .",
    "this property allows us to adjust the qs s energy and time scales without changing its dynamical regime , which is solely controlled by the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the qs is integrable for @xmath9 , strongly chaotic for @xmath10 and mixed for intermediate values .",
    "in addition to the dynamical regime , the number of qs s coupled to the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) plays a crucial role in the dynamics of dissipation . in order to compare results for different values of @xmath0 , the coupling parameter @xmath11 , as seen in equation ,",
    "has to be properly normalized with the size of the environment , so that the effective coupling becomes independent of @xmath0 for large @xmath0 .",
    "we use @xmath12 and derive this scaling later using linear response theory .",
    "we want to study the behavior of the system for a single global initial condition and we consider two types of initialization . in both cases",
    "the ho starts from @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in the first type , the initial condition for each qs is chosen randomly at a fixed energy shell @xmath18 .",
    "this choice is related to the microcanonical distribution @xmath19 where @xmath20 , for @xmath21 .",
    "we refer to it as _ pseudo - microcanonical _ , to distinguish it from the real microcanonical distribution which is uniform over the entire energy shell of the @xmath0 qs s .",
    "the second type of initialization corresponds to pick a different energy shell @xmath22 for each qs from the boltzmann distribution @xmath23 and we call it _",
    "pseudo - canonical_. the initial condition for each qs is again chosen randomly at the corresponding energy @xmath22 .",
    "in all simulations the coupling parameter will be fixed at @xmath24 .",
    "we consider initially the pseudo - microcanonical distribution with @xmath25 .",
    "we first study the role of chaos in promoting dissipation .",
    "fixing @xmath26 we integrate hamilton s equations for different values of the parameter @xmath8 and compute the energy of the harmonic oscillator @xmath27 as a function of the time .",
    "time is measured in units of the ho s period , @xmath28 .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows the results of simulations for a single numerical realization for three values of @xmath8 .",
    "qs in distinct dynamical regimes : integrable , @xmath29 ( blue ) ; mixed , @xmath30 ( red ) ; chaotic , @xmath31 ( black ) . ]    in the integrable regime , @xmath29 , the effect of the environment is minimal , causing a small decrease in the oscillator s energy and inducing small amplitude , noisy , oscillations . in the mixed case ,",
    "@xmath30 , the energy loss is slightly larger and the oscillations are more clearly visible , particularly at shorter times . at long times",
    "the energy fluctuates around @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to the papers @xcite for numerical results on analogous systems , computed via ensemble averages , in the regular and in mixed regimes .",
    "the authors describe in great detail the dependence of the dissipation rate on the number of degrees of freedom of the environment in these regimes .    in the chaotic regime",
    "the energy of the ho shows a clear exponential decay for @xmath26 qs s .",
    "similar results were obtained in @xcite with @xmath33 but performing ensemble averages over several thousands of trajectories .",
    "the results displayed in fig.[fig1 ] are for a single trajectory .",
    "changing the initial conditions in the environment , but keeping the same microcanonical constraint , produces energy curves that differ only in the details of the fluctuations , but not in their main qualitative features .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom of the environment is of fundamental importance to the effective dissipative behavior .",
    "the exponential decay observed in fig.[fig1 ] occurs only if @xmath0 is sufficiently large .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the typical behavior of @xmath34 for different values of @xmath0 .        for small environments qs @xmath35 , the fluctuations are so large that dissipation can not be characterized for each numerical realization .",
    "in these cases , and in particular for @xmath33 , exponential dissipation can be observed only in an ensemble averaged treatment of the energy @xcite .",
    "increasing the number of qs s to @xmath36 makes the decreasing behavior of the ho energy more evident , although the fluctuations are still large .",
    "finally , for the parameters of this simulation , the curves converge to a @xmath0-independent exponential decay @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "such convergence occurs only if the coupling constant scales properly with @xmath0 .",
    "clearly @xmath11 has to decrease with the number of qs in the environment , otherwise the interaction hamiltonian @xmath39 would diverge as @xmath2 .",
    "only if @xmath12 , the effect of the environment over the ho converges as @xmath0 becomes large , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "this scaling of the coupling constant will be demonstrated using linear response theory .",
    "environments with @xmath40 behave as infinite reservoirs .",
    "clearly , @xmath41 depends on the model parameters and , in particular , on @xmath8 , that controls the degree of chaos in the qs .",
    "indeed , dissipation is intimately associated with correlation functions that contain information about the memory of the environment . increasing the phase space region covered by chaos ( by decreasing @xmath8 )",
    "makes these correlation functions decay faster , leading to a faster transfer of energy from the oscillator to the environment , even for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "this makes @xmath41 smaller for smaller values of @xmath8 .",
    "the flow of energy between the ho and environment also depends on the relative time scales of the ho and qs . increasing the ho frequency ( @xmath42 ) decreases the relative velocity of the two subsystems , leading to a less efficient energy dissipation .",
    "however , since the qs is scalable , we can always change its energy in such a way to readjust its relative velocity .",
    "the decay rate @xmath43 , or the characteristic time @xmath44 , also changes with @xmath45 , as shown in fig.[fig3 ] for @xmath26 and @xmath31 .",
    "the dependence is well fitted by a quadratic law , a result that will also be demonstrated using linear response theory .     as a function of the coupling constant ( @xmath46 for @xmath26 and @xmath31 .",
    "the curve is well fitted by a quadratic function . ]    the numerical results in fig.[fig2 ] show that small chaotic environments may behave as infinite reservoirs , absorbing energy from the ho .",
    "this behavior can be further characterized by associating a temperature to the full system after its equilibration . in order to do so",
    ", we look at the energy distribution of the ho and the environment at equilibrium .",
    "this can be done in two different ways : the first is to count , at a fixed time , the number of qs s with energy in the interval @xmath47 for a large number of initial conditions ( ensemble average ) .",
    "the second possibility is to count , for a single realization , the number os qs s with energy in the interval @xmath47 , starting at some time after equilibration and repeating the procedure several times at a pre - specified time step ( time average ) .",
    "the same procedures can be applied to the energy of the ho .",
    "the statistical distribution of these results will be the same if the system is ergodic .",
    "we performed numerical calculations using both the time and ensemble averages and found very similar results , indicating that both the environment and the ho are indeed ergodic in equilibrium .    in order to define a temperature for the environment we use the general equipartition theorem @xcite to show that @xmath48 .",
    "the energy distribution of the environment for @xmath26 is well fitted by @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is a measure of the environment s temperature .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows that the energy distribution of the ho also follows a boltzmann - like distribution , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , showing that the systems are indeed in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the temperature is @xmath54 .",
    "energy was sampled @xmath55 times at equal intervals . ]",
    "this is an important result of this paper , that distinguishes between the coupling of the ho with a single qs ( where results are averaged over many realizations with different initial conditions ) @xcite and the coupling with many ( @xmath56 ) simultaneous qs ( and no average over realizations ) . in the former case",
    "a temperature can be defined only by modifying the definition of entropy @xcite .",
    "when several qs s are present , the indirect , and therefore weak , interaction between the members of the environment plays a key role in the dynamics of the system .",
    "it is this weak interaction that allows for their eventual equilibration .",
    "these numerical results suggest that classically irreversible processes may indeed occur in nature if the system interacts with a small , but not too small , chaotic environment .",
    "the primary coupling between the system and the environment leads to dissipation whereas the secondary interactions between the few , but chaotic , degrees of freedom of the environment , leads to thermalization .",
    "we can understand the basic mechanisms of dissipation using linear response theory ( _ lrt _ ) @xcite .",
    "we start by writing an approximation to the full hamiltonian of the system as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent the full set of canonical variables of the environment , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the second term @xmath62 is a perturbation that includes the central system through the time dependent function @xmath63 .",
    "this approximation to is valid in the limit of weak coupling , since the central system is treated as an external source that does not respond to the environment .",
    "the feedback of the environment on the central system will be considered in a moment .",
    "the dynamics can be described by the liouville equation @xmath64 where the liouville operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 = i}\\left\\ { h,\\rho\\right\\ } .",

    ". can also be written in integral form as @xmath70    the initial distribution @xmath71 is assumed to be invariant under @xmath7 , like , for example , the pseudo - microcanonical or pseudo - canonical distributions given by eq .. the action of @xmath72 removes the environment from this initial equilibrium . if the perturbation is small , eq . can be expanded to first order in @xmath66 as @xmath73 the ensemble average of a general function @xmath74 can then be calculated as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the _ response function _ of @xmath74 when the environment is under the influence of the perturbation @xmath77 .",
    "the subscript @xmath78 indicates that the averages are computed with the initial invariant distribution @xmath79 .",
    "we can now compute the response of the central system to the environment .",
    "for the hamiltonian the ho satisfies the equation @xmath80 and is perturbed by the ` external force ' @xmath81 .",
    "if the dynamics of the bath coordinates @xmath82 are chaotic we may replace @xmath83 by its average @xmath84 : @xmath85        using eq .",
    ", @xmath86 where @xmath87 . the first term in the righthand side of eq .",
    "is zero due to the parity of @xmath7 . using the pseudo - microcanonical as the initial invariant distribution",
    "it follows that @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the response function obtained by bonana @xcite for the case of a single qs coupled with the oscillator . substituting in and we obtain @xmath90 that shows that it is necessary to re - scale the coupling constant as @xmath91 , in order for the external driving @xmath92 to be independent of the size of the environment in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "the approximation where the @xmath0 chaotic systems forming the environment are treated independently correspond to ensemble averages of a single qs coupled to the central system .",
    "as we have seen , this approximation can not describe the long time equilibration of the environment , since this requires some interaction between the chaotic systems .",
    "linear response theory can not , therefore describe the long - time behavior of the system .",
    "in particular , it can not describe the change from an initial pseudo - microcanonical distribution to the final canonical distribution .    .",

    "fig.[fig5 ] shows the breakdown of the pseudo - microcanonical distribution and its consecutive rearrangement to a boltzmann - like distribution as a function of time .",
    "the transition between the distributions occurs at about @xmath96 of the characteristic time for dissipation , as can be seen from figs.[fig5 ] and [ fig10 ] .",
    "as pointed out in the last section , this redistribution of energy is promoted by the secondary interactions between the qs s .",
    "this rapid equilibration on the environment hints to the possibility of using lrt to describe the long time behavior of the system by changing from the initial pseudo - microcanonical to the pseudo - canonical distribution .",
    "if the initial temperature , as given by @xmath97 , does not change much during the time evolution , the environment will not be largely affected by the central system , and the interaction between the qs s can be ignored .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] shows an example with @xmath26 and @xmath98 where the distribution of energy of the environment does not change significantly with time .",
    "therefore , for @xmath0 sufficiently large , we can establish a regime where the central system dissipates energy exponentially , but the environment s temperature remains nearly constant .",
    "this allows us to use the lrt to describe the system dynamics for much longer times . in order to do this",
    "we need to obtain explicit expressions for eqs . and for the pseudo - canonical distribution .",

    "it is important to note that the time scale where @xmath104 is significant is much smaller than the time scale of the dissipation , as can be seen by comparison with fig.[fig2 ] .     with @xmath105",

    "it turns out that @xmath111 increases linearly with @xmath0 , as shown in fig.[fig8 ] , and we call @xmath112 the slope of such linear function .",
    "the index  @xmath113 \" on @xmath108 and @xmath112 expresses the dependence with the mean energy of reservoir , as we will see in a moment .",
    "equation indicates that the presence of chaos introduces a fast memory loss in the microscopic dynamics of reservoir , so that its dynamics can be described by a markovian process , unlike the integrable and mixed regimes .     and the number of qs s in the environment .",
    "the slope depends on the environment s mean energy . ]",
    "using we obtain the response function @xmath114 substituting @xmath115 in equations and , and computing the integrals , we obtain @xmath116 where    @xmath117    the inverse characteristic time @xmath118 obtained from lrt decreases exponentially with @xmath113 as shown in fig.[fig9 ] ( circles ) .",
    "the numerically obtained values , on the other hand , displays a more complex behavior , as shown by the squares in the same figure .",
    "the numerical results can be divided into two regimes : the first , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 increases with @xmath121 and , the second regime , where @xmath122 and @xmath120 decreases with @xmath121 .",
    "the inverse characteristic time as a function of the environment s mean energy for : theoretical model ( @xmath118 , red circles ) ; and numerical data ( @xmath43 , black squares ) . ]",
    "the discrepancies between the numerical and lrt results can be understood if we note that in the first regime , where @xmath113 is small , the qs s are very slow . since the value of @xmath118 is related to the maximal amplitude of the correlation @xmath104 , this value increases considerably in these regimes because changes in the state of the quartic oscillators are slow .",
    "this , in turn , implies a super - estimated value for @xmath118 . in this regime , as @xmath113 increases , the influence of the environment on the ho increases , facilitating the flow of energy and increasing @xmath118 . this is a non - trivial effect , since an environment with lower mean energy should correspond to a cooler thermal bath , with a greater dissipation rate",
    "this shows that the finite set of qs s can not be traded by a thermal bath at very low energies .",
    "after a threshold is passed @xmath43 recovers the expected decreasing behavior and the association between the mean energy and temperature is restored . even in this case ,",
    "where the qualitative behavior of @xmath118 and @xmath43 is the same , the numerical value of the coefficients needs some correction .",
    "we define the parameter @xmath123 in order to adjust the theoretical model with numerical results .",

    "we constructed a simple model of classical dissipation where a harmonic oscillator interacts with an environment consisting of @xmath0 identical quartic sub - systems ( qs ) with two degrees of freedom .",
    "interactions among the sub - systems occur via the harmonic oscillator and are , therefore , of second order in the coupling constant . in order to compare results with different number of qs s",
    "we re - scaled the coupling constant according with @xmath125 .",
    "the main result of this paper is that a small chaotic environment can indeed behave as an effective infinite reservoir , promoting energy flow and equilibration with smaller systems in a single realization of the dynamics .",
    "this is to be contrasted with previous results where a single chaotic system plays the role of environment and thermodynamical behavior is achieved via ensemble average over many realizations with random initial conditions @xcite .",
    "for the same values of parameters the results with @xmath26 are roughly equivalent to averaging over 30,000 initial conditions . comparing our model environment with those composed of harmonic oscillators with linear distribution of frequencies @xcite ,",
    "the number of oscillators needed to mimic an infinite reservoir is at least an order of magnitude larger than needed for chaotic qs s .    at long times",
    "the environment and the ho equilibrate and their energy distributions converge to boltzmann - like curves with the same temperature .",
    "the equilibration of the environment depends on the indirect interactions among its members that occur via the ho .",
    "we have also developed a linear response theory to describe the system .",
    "we have shown , in particular , that the scaling of the coupling constant with @xmath0 is indeed correct and that dissipation constant @xmath43 depends quadratically on @xmath45 ."
