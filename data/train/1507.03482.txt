    "you remember the last time you felt genuinely nervous ? maybe you had a pressing deadline and very little time to write a report or perhaps you received an unpleasant e - mail you had to reply to .",
    "this tension can suppose the appearance of stress @xcite . in the literature , stress has been defined as a reaction from a calm state to an excited state in order to preserve the integrity of the organism @xcite .",
    "hence , there are stressful situations where individuals must deal with changes in their condition ( from a calm state to an excited state ) .",
    "this reaction is given by changes and pressures which provoke physical and physiological responses @xcite .",
    "the presence of stress has been associated with a decrease in performance @xcite . according to the yerkes - dodson law @xcite ,",
    "this achievement is a function of arousal , as shown in fig .",
    "[ yerkes - dodson ] .",
    "performance increases with arousal when any individual feel relaxed , then reaches its peak at the highest arousal level because the patient be involved in the task , and decreases when the individual feel in a breakdown or anxiety situation .",
    "the aim of this article is to use the yerkes - dodson law to design an individual performance curve using physiological responses .",
    "we need to explore all the possible stress values ( from a comfort to a breakdown state ) to obtain the performance of a user .",
    "we already know that humans reacts to stress situations , next questions we need to answer are when these situations happen and how we can measure this stress .",
    "stress reactions are different for each person , but present similar behaviours doing the same exercise .",
    "different tests have been used in the literature for stress detection .",
    "renaud and j. blondin @xcite used stroop color test @xcite , a recognition test with in congruent questions to obtaining the individual performance based on number of correct answers .",
    "e. jovanov et al .",
    "@xcite used specific military personal training to know the performance of a soldier based on time reaction .",
    "arousal is also closely related to subject s performance in mental tasks .",
    "there are different ways to determine the level of arousal that an individual is achieving while performing activities .",
    "two subjective approaches : sagat and nasa - tlx , have been used in aeronautic operations . using the first one , the fly controller was then required to answer a written questionnaire in order to compare his mental model with reality .",
    "questions were selected according to the spatial knowledge . on the other hand ,",
    "nasa task load index ( nasa - tlx ) is a multi - dimensional scale designed to estimate the controller s workload while performing a task .",
    "it consists of six subscales that represent the subjective workload experienced by the controller .",
    "these scales involve mental , physical and temporal demand , effort , frustration and performance .",
    "emotional states provoke changes in different physiological signals that can be measured in order to obtain information about the mental state of the individual .",
    "various methods for detecting stress levels by monitoring physiological signals in different status are already presented in the literature .",
    "d. wu et al .",
    "@xcite captured in real - time physiological responses : galvanic skin response ( gsr ) , respiration , ecg and electroencephalogram ( eeg ) .",
    "they captured these signals for identification and classification into an optimal arousal as indicated the yerkes - dodson law taking into account the user performance .",
    "another case was zhai and barreto @xcite , who s acquired different affective features : gsr , blood volume pressure ( bvp ) , pupil diameter ( pd ) and skin diameter ( st ) to differentiate states ( relax or mental stress ) in computers user .",
    "the main scope of this work is to analyse physiological signals and determinate when an individual starts to suffer a decrease in performance , according to the yerkes - dodson curve . by eliciting each subject from a low level arousal to a breakdown situation",
    ", it is possible to find a proper calibration for the yerkes - dodson law stress detection .",
    "our proposal consists of eliciting each subject to simulate the arousal of yerkes - dodson law . to explore all the stress possibilities ,",
    "our method is based two different test : one of visual attention and another of logical reasoning .",
    "each individual starts in a comfort situation , continuing with an alertness and optimal performance state , and finishing with an anxiety and breakdown condition . if we go across the obtainedresults , its calibrates each individual performance because we have all the possible arousal points .",
    "therefore we only have to make a relation with the achievement performance .",
    "we propose to detect stress signs in real time and acquisition in a non - intrusive way with wearable devices to minimize the inconvenience caused by the monitoring .",
    "taking into account different biomedical responses , our proposal is to capture signals using wireless sensors which acquire signal based in movement , heart beats and electrodermal activity ( eda ) .",
    "three shimmer ( shimmer research , dublin , ireland ) sensors were used for data acquisition .",
    "a shimmer3 ` gsr unit ' sensor was used to capture bvp and gsr signals . on the left hand ,",
    "the bvp optical pulse sensor was placed on the palmar surface of the pinky finger @xcite . for gsr signals two electrodes on the palmar surface of the middle and index fingers",
    "were placed @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ shimmerbvp ] .        another sensor model , shimmer3 ` exg unit ' ,",
    "was used to capture emg and ecg signals . in the case of ecg ,",
    "[ shimmerecg ] shows how the electrodes were positioned on the chest @xcite .        in order to capture emg signals , fig .",
    "[ shimmeremg ] shows an example of right arm electrode layout .",
    "two electrodes were placed in parallel with the muscle fibres of the biceps , near the centre of the muscle and the reference electrode an electrically neutral point of the body , as far away as reasonably possible from the muscle being measured @xcite .",
    "an experimental test was developed to capture physiological signals . to asses",
    "the effectiveness , we collected experimental data from two states conditions : mental stress and relaxation .",
    "two different tests have been designed to elicit stress : stroop color word test @xcite and mathematical operations , whereas the relaxation condition consisted on deep breathing exercises . with stroop test",
    "we found the reaction activity of each individual , while with the maths operations try to evaluate the capacity of concentration .",
    "physiological measures of gsr , ecg , emg and bvp were continuously recorded throughout exposure to the environment . in this study",
    ", we propose the protocol shown in table [ tab_overview ] :    .experimental protocol [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "an individual performance calibration have been designed .",
    "we used two tests for assessment of affective functioning to identify the performance level in mental tasks .",
    "the experiment consist of three wireless sensors that acquire signals : ecg , emg , bvp and gsr .",
    "the system was validated through a series of test that the subject was elicited to stress or relax situations .",
    "the number of correct responses were used to distinguish among different arousal levels .",
    "bvp signals where discarded because only the information extracted from them is similar to the obtained from the ecg measurements . in the other hand ,",
    "movement activity were discarded because after the experiment we saw that the results were not relevant stress information in this specific experiment .",
    "the results form the research outlined shows a promising correlation between the emotional stress and the ecg and gsr signals monitored as it is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig_4_ecgstd ] , fig .",
    "[ fig_4_gsrnumber ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_4_gsramplitude ] .",
    "our results show that , under controlled conditions the ecg and gsr features can differentiate between relaxed and stressed user states , as elicited by incongruent stroop simulation and maths operation test .",
    "we can conclude :    * two of the signals , gsr and ecg , have discriminative power to distinguish between relaxation and stress periods * there exists a positive correlation between the complexity level of the tests and the gsr and ecg signals * the part just before the number of correct responses decrease is considered the highest performance level of the yerkes - dodson law    besides , fig .",
    "[ fig_4_slopeecg ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_4_slopegsr ] has performed to have a relation between the curve of yerkes - dodson law and our proposal experiment .",
    "this two figures shows that the slope is greater in the metal stress than relaxation situations so it seems that each patient has more stress reactions in a difficult level than in a easy level .",
    "allow for fig .",
    "[ results ] , table [ tab : colornaming ] and table [ tab : mathoperat ] , we can conclude that the subjects performance starts to decrease sooner in the color naming than in the maths operation test .",
    "additionally , table [ tab : features ] , can be used to compare the results obtained from the individuals performance identification .",
    "we can observe how much increase in hr and gsr peaks each individual showed before the performance decrease . taking into account that one of the main aim of this paper is to study individuals response to stress situations , the mentioned table clearly shows how the subjects psychological reactions behave in different ways .",
    "an emphasis of the system presented in this paper was the use of signals that can be collected under normal conditions of computer usage .",
    "all the sensor used are non - intrusive .",
    "we expect that , eventually , all sensors could be build into standard pieces of a computer , such as a smart - watch with a bvp and gsr acquisition system .",
    "the experiments can not be utilised for the same subj ects because they learn the answers and the results were unexpected .",
