    "binary exponential backoff ( beb ) is widely adopted as a key collision resolution mechanism in popular random - access networks , such as ieee @xmath4 ethernet and ieee @xmath5 wireless local area network ( wlan ) . with exponential backoff ( eb ) ,",
    "a packet is transmitted after waiting a number of time slots randomly selected from a contention window , the size of which increases multiplicatively on collisions .",
    "mathematically , the contention window @xmath6 after @xmath7 consecutive collisions of a packet . here",
    ", @xmath8 with @xmath2 is the backoff function for eb must be an increasing function for the backoff process to be meaningful .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 must be larger than unity . ] and @xmath10 is the initial contention window size .",
    "beb is a special case with @xmath11 .",
    "most of the research attention has been focused on investigating the throughput provided by eb .",
    "thanks to the seminal work of bianchi@xcite , the throughput is now well understood through a fixed point equation that characterizes the backoff process .",
    "subsequently , @xcite shows that the throughput of eb is stable against the network size in the sense that the throughput converges to a nonzero constant when the network size goes to infinity ( assuming no retry limit is enforced ) .",
    "throughput stability has been the most intriguing aspect of eb , and has enabled eb - based mac protocols to support a wide range of throughput oriented applications regardless of the network congestion level .    with the recent boom of delay - sensitive multimedia applications such as voip and video conferencing , research interests",
    "are being shifted to other aspects of system performance such as delay , delay jitter , and short - term fairness @xcite .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that delay jitter significantly affects the users perception of quality of real - time multimedia services .",
    "eb , despite its good throughput performance , has been shown to suffer poor performance in delay and short - term fairness .",
    "more specifically , eb could induce divergent ( i.e. , infinite ) second- and high - order moments of medium access delay , yielding extraordinarily large delay jitter and severe transmission starvation of users @xcite .",
    "essentially , the medium access delay follows a power law distribution , implying that a non - negligible number of packets may experience much larger delay than the average @xcite . as a motivating example",
    ", we monitor the packet transmission during a @xmath12 second period in a @xmath13-node ieee @xmath5 g wlan , where beb is adopted .",
    "alarmingly , @xmath14 out of the @xmath13 nodes experience severe transmission starvation , as illustrated in fig . @xmath15 .",
    "the figure shows that node @xmath16 and @xmath17 perceive starvation for a duration of @xmath18 and @xmath19 seconds , respectively .",
    "even worse , node @xmath14 barely receives any service throughout the entire simulation time .",
    "consecutive seconds for @xmath14 of @xmath13 nodes in a 802.11 g system .",
    "assume that all nodes are continuously backlogged and no retry limit is enforced.,width=336 ]    in an attempt to address the above issues , this paper seeks to understand the following important questions .    1 .",
    "what is the root cause of the power - law delay distribution of eb .",
    "is it an intrinsic issue of eb , or can be avoided by adjusting the backoff exponent @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   if the problem is intrinsic with eb , can we find an alternative backoff function that does not suffer the same problem .",
    "in general , what is the necessary and sufficient condition for a backoff function to have convergent delay moments , i.e. , not to experience power law delay .",
    "3 .   is it possible to achieve throughput stability and convergent delay moments at the same time by certain backoff functions .",
    "if not , are there any backoff functions that exhibit convergent delay moments and good throughput performance at the same time when the network size is within a finite and practical range .    in the literature , @xmath20 has been partly addressed .",
    "@xcite first finds that the medium access delay distribution of eb is heavy - tailed when retry limit @xmath21 is infinite , regardless of the backoff exponent @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite later proves that the medium access delay indeed follows a power law distribution , the slope of which is obtained as a function of the backoff exponent and the collision probability .",
    "noticeably , the effect of power law delay can not be eliminated even if a finite retry limit k is enforced in practical systems . @xcite and @xcite observe that the medium access delay follows a truncated power law distribution , implying that small retry limit does not eliminate the power law characteristics induced by eb .",
    "this directly translates to high packet loss rate , if packets have to be discarded upon reaching a retry limit @xmath21 . indeed ,",
    "our simulation results show that beb suffers @xmath22 packet loss rate in a @xmath23-node network with @xmath24 , leading to an equal percentage reduction of throughput as that with @xmath25 .",
    "the analysis in these prior work can be treated as a special case of the analysis for general backoff functions in this paper .    as to @xmath26 , there are some initial attempts to replace eb with other more moderate backoff algorithms , such as linear backoff ( @xmath27 ) and polynomial backoff ( @xmath28)@xcite .",
    "observations made by @xcite showed that linear and polynomial backoffs with appropriate parameter settings can improve upon beb in terms of throughput and delay performance .",
    "@xcite observed that pb can achieve a similar saturation throughput as eb but with much smaller delay jitter .",
    "however , to the authors best knowledge , no analysis was provided to explain the root cause behind the phenomenon .    to fully address the important questions @xmath29",
    ", this paper attempts to uncover the fundamental laws that govern the throughput stability and tail distribution of medium access delay .",
    "our main contributions are detailed below .",
    "* we find that the heaviness of the tail distribution of medium access delay is closely related to how rapidly the contention window is augmented with each collision .",
    "specifically , eb always induces power law delay distribution regardless of the choice of backoff exponent @xmath9 .",
    "meanwhile , power law delay is mitigated as long as the backoff function is slower than exponential functions , i.e. , @xmath1 for all @xmath2 , where @xmath30 will be defined more rigorously later .",
    "this explains the observations made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that delay distribution becomes light - tailed if the backoff function increases linearly or sub - linearly .",
    "* we prove that throughput stability is achieved only when the backoff function is at least as fast as an exponential function , i.e. , @xmath3 for some @xmath2 , where @xmath31 will be defined rigorously later . in other words , pb fails to sustain non - zero asymptotic throughput , although they yield convergent delay moments .",
    "this presents a fundamental tradeoff between throughput stability and the heaviness of tail delay distribution .",
    "* we find that super - linear polynomial backoff achieves high throughput across a wide range of practical network size , despite its throughput instability asymptotically .",
    "this , together with our findings in @xmath32 , suggests that super - linear polynomial backoff is a better alternative than eb in supporting broadband network applications that call for both high throughput and low delay and delay jitter .",
    "our study on the delay tail distribution of backoff process is not only for theoretical interest but also closely related to engineering applications . in the past few years",
    ", a number of modified exponential backoff schemes , including quality of service enhancing protocols , have been proposed to improve the delay performance of conventional beb @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite proposed a lmild backoff algorithm , in which the contention window doubles upon collisions whereas decreases linearly upon successful transmissions . besides",
    ", the enhanced distributed channel access ( edca ) scheme , which is adopted in the @xmath33 standard , gives priority to delay - sensitive applications by setting a shorter contention window and shorter arbitration inter - frame space @xcite . despite their respective contributions , they do not eliminate the fundamental feature of power law delay distribution induced by exponential backoff , and thus may still perceive relatively large delay jitter or high packet loss rate .",
    "instead , we propose to fundamentally solve the power law delay problem by replacing eb with pb .",
    "meanwhile , we show that high throughput can be achieved in a wide range of practical network size through parameter tuning of pb . in this sense",
    ", we can mitigate the power law delay distribution of eb without hurting the advantageous throughput performance .",
    "our simulation results show that pb with reasonable backoff parameter outperforms beb regardless of the existence of the retry limit . with current hardware processing power ,",
    "the implementation of pb in random access networks incurs minor extra cost .",
    "therefore , we believe it is a promising algorithm with broad applications in future random access networks .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review the backoff protocols and introduce some background information in section ii . in section iii",
    ", the main results of this paper is summarized . in section iv",
    ", we analyze the power law tail distribution of medium access delay for general backoff protocols . in section",
    "v , we derive the condition to sustain stable throughput .",
    "simulation results are presented in section vi , where we show that pb is a better alternative than eb in random access networks .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section vii .",
    "in this section , we first briefly review the operation of general backoff protocols .",
    "we then introduce the notion of medium access delay and some important metrics that will be used in later sections to evaluate the performance of different backoff schemes .",
    "we consider a fully connected wlan consisting of @xmath34 continuously backlogged nodes .",
    "illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath35 , the transmission of @xmath14 nodes is coordinated by a backoff mechanism . at each packet transmission ,",
    "a node sets a backoff counter value @xmath36 by randomly choosing an integer from a contention window @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 is the size of contention window . at the initial transmission attempt of a packet , @xmath38",
    "is set to its minimum value @xmath10 .",
    "the contention window size is incremented on each collision .",
    "after @xmath39 collision , we say the node is in its @xmath39 backoff stage and the contention window size @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is an increasing backoff function characterizing the backoff process .",
    "for example , @xmath8 , @xmath40 for eb , @xmath41 , @xmath40 and @xmath42 for sub - exponential backoff ( seb ) , @xmath43 , @xmath44 for polynomial backoff ( pb ) .",
    "we denote the backoff counter value at the @xmath39 backoff stage by @xmath45 .",
    "the backoff counter value decreases by one following each time slot , which could either be an idle slot or a transmission time slot .",
    "the packet is transmitted once the backoff counter reaches zero .",
    "when there is a finite retry limit @xmath21 , a packet is dropped if it has not been successfully transmitted after @xmath21 retransmissions .",
    "the backoff process is illustrated in fig . @xmath35 .",
    "for example , a tagged packet at node @xmath16 experiences three backoff stages before a successful transmission . in backoff stage @xmath46",
    ", one backoff countdown slot is occupied by the collision between node @xmath17 and @xmath14 , while the other countdown slots are idle time slots . after the countdown process in stage @xmath46",
    ", node @xmath16 collides with node @xmath17 s transmission and enters backoff stage @xmath16 .",
    "the process repeats until it successfully transmits after backoff stage @xmath17 .     and backoff schemes .",
    "the initial backoff window @xmath47 and the retry limit @xmath25.,width=336 ]    the exact backoff process is very complex and often intractable , since the success and collision processes of various nodes are coupled and strongly correlated @xcite .",
    "a common technique adopted by most of the prior work on saturation analysis is the mean field decoupling approximation , where the backoff process at one node is decoupled and treated as if it is independent from the backoff processes at the other nodes .",
    "specifically , it assumes that a node encounters a collision probability @xmath48 when it transmits , regardless of its own backoff stage .",
    "moreover , the average attempt rate of an arbitrary node in a generic time slot , denoted by @xmath49 , is assumed to be constant and does not vary with the backoff stage @xcite .",
    "the validity of mean field approximation for eb has been recently verified in both theorem and experiments @xcite . to validate the assumption for general backoff functions , we reproduce the experiments in @xcite and plot @xmath48 against backoff stage for three representative backoff functions in fig . @xmath50 .",
    "the figure shows that , @xmath48 is largely independent of the backoff stage for all the backoff functions in consideration . in particular , the variances of @xmath48 across backoff stage are less than @xmath51 for all three backoff functions .",
    "the simulation results match the analytical results based on mean field approximation , which will be introduced in ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can safely adopt the assumptions in this paper to analyze the throughput and delay performance of general backoff schemes .    under mean field approximation , the probabilities of a time slot",
    "being an idle time slot , successful transmission or a collision can be calculated as @xmath52 with ( [ 19 ] ) , normalized throughput @xmath53 , defined as the portion of time occupied by successful packet transmissions , is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the lengths of idle , success and collision time slots , respectively .",
    "an important metric of system performance is throughput stability . here",
    ", we say a backoff scheme is throughput - stable if it can yield non - zero asymptotic throughput when the network size approaches infinity ( i.e. , becomes extraordinarily large ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the transmission probability @xmath49 of a saturation network in steady - state is the root of a fixed point system @xmath58},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the probability of a node encounters a collision when it transmits , which is given by @xmath59 the above fixed point system always has one unique solution as long as the backoff function @xmath0 is non - decreasing for @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "as we will show in later sections , some important properties of system performance , such as power law delay behavior and asymptotic throughput , are closely related to the value of @xmath48 .",
    "it is worth noting that , @xmath61 always holds in a system under steady - state , despite that the limit of @xmath48 could be @xmath16 . otherwise ,",
    "if @xmath62 , all nodes will continuously encounter collisions and enter the next backoff stage . in this case , the limiting distribution of backoff stages does not exist and the system can never be in steady - state .    for simplicity , we assume that the retry limit @xmath21 is infinite hereafter , so as to better understand the factors that fundamentally affect the properties of a backoff function without considering the implementation details . in this case , ( [ 2 ] ) becomes @xmath63}.\\ ] ] the results obtained from the infinite-@xmath21 model can be easily translated to the standard systems with finite @xmath21 .",
    "for instance , an infinite - variance medium access delay distribution in the infinite-@xmath21 model indicates high packet loss rate in the standard networks .",
    "in fact , we will show this implication in the simulations section where results for both cases are presented .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use  delay \" and  medium access delay \" interchangeably throughout the paper .",
    "illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath35 , the medium access delay of a packet , denoted by @xmath64 , is the time period from the instant it becomes the head - of - line ( hol ) packet to the instant at which the packet is successfully transmitted .",
    "medium access delay of a packet consists of three parts , namely a series of backoff countdowns , collisions involving the tagged node and successful transmissions of the tagged node@xcite .",
    "in particular , the backoff countdown slots seen by a tagged node include idle slots as well as the busy slots , successful or collided , due to other nodes .",
    "for example , the medium access delay of the tagged packet at node @xmath16 in fig .",
    "@xmath35 includes @xmath14 backoff countdown stages , @xmath17 collision slots involving node @xmath16 and a successful transmission slot .",
    "suppose that a packet is successfully transmitted after @xmath65 collisions .",
    "then , the medium access delay of this packet denoted by @xmath66 , is @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the time consumed on backoff countdown at the @xmath39 backoff stage .",
    "it is the summation of a number of backoff countdown slots , given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the length of its @xmath71 countdown slot , which could either be @xmath57 , @xmath56 or an idle time slot @xmath55 .",
    "we denote the probability density function of medium access delay @xmath64 by @xmath72 and its tail distribution function @xmath73 .      in many engineering applications ,",
    "we often encounter heavy - tailed distributions whose tail decaying rate is slower than exponential@xcite . for instance , it is observed that both the size of data files stored in web servers and the process execution time in a computing environment follow heavy - tailed distribution@xcite .",
    "power law distribution belongs to a subclass of heavy - tailed distribution , whose tail distribution follows a power law decaying rate .",
    "conversely , a probability distribution is light - tailed if it is not heavy - tailed .",
    "the definitions of the different distributions with respect to the decay rate of tail distribution are formally defined as follows and illustrated in fig . @xmath74 .",
    "* definition 1 : * a probability distribution @xmath72 is power law distribution with slope parameter @xmath75 , if its tail distribution function @xmath76 satisfies @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a slow varying function ( i.e. , slower than any power function , such that @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",

    "in fact , the tail decaying rate of a probability distribution is closely related to the convergence of moments .",
    "specifically , a finite @xmath84 $ ] indicates that the tail distribution decays faster than a polynomial function with power @xmath87 ( cf .",

    "the rhs of ( [ 26 ] ) could still be infinite even if all moments are finite .",
    "for example , weibull distribution with shape parameter smaller than @xmath16 is a heavy - tailed distribution but not a power law distribution .",

    "if a delay distribution is identified as a power law or heavy - tailed distribution , the probability of extremely large delay occurs is non - negligible .",
    "for instance , it is shown in @xcite and @xcite that the delay distribution of eb follows power law distribution , which is considered as the root cause of poor delay performance and user unfairness in current wlan systems . in this paper , we develop a unified framework to study the heaviness of delay tail distribution of any general backoff functions , making the study in @xcite and @xcite a special case of ours .    before leaving this session , we introduce the following two important notations to describe the limiting behavior of functions .    * definition 3 : * a function @xmath94 , if @xmath95 and @xmath96 such that @xmath97 , @xmath98 .    * definition 4 : * a function @xmath99 , if @xmath100 , @xmath96 such that @xmath101 , @xmath98 .",
