    "the high field nonlinear polarizability of diatomic molecules is a topic of practical and fundamental importance . from optical frequency conversion @xcite to simulations and experiments in high intensity propagation @xcite , understanding the atomic and molecular behaviour under high laser fields is crucial for applications . unlike in monatomic gases ,",
    "the nonlinear molecular response can not be characterized by a single coefficient at a given optical frequency : processes at several timescales contribute , and so the response depends on pulse duration @xcite . at the fastest timescale ,",

    "optical laser excitation of vibrational and rotational states can occur by two - photon raman excitation , but for commonly used @xmath150 - 100 fs optical pump pulses , there is insufficient laser bandwidth ( @xmath10 ev ) to excite vibrational modes in molecules of interest for atmospheric propagation ( @xmath11 ev for n@xmath0 ) , and only rotational states are excited @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , to our knowledge there has never been a controlled experiment directly measuring the full , time - resolved electronic and rovibrational nonlinear response of a light molecule .    here , we measure the full absolute electronic and rovibrational nonlinear response of h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 to intense ultrashort optical pulses up to the ionization threshold of @xmath15 w/@xmath3 .",
    "we use the technique of single - shot supercontinuum spectral interferometry ( sssi ) @xcite .",
    "the 40 fs pump pulse inducing the nonlinear response is sufficiently short to impulsively drive the rotational nonlinearity , but , on its own , can not drive vibrational modes as discussed above .",
    "however , the vibrational component of the nonlinearity contributes to a two - beam coupling phase shift and energy transfer @xcite , even for a long pump pulse .",
    "we use this phase shift , which is independent of the amplitude of a sufficiently weak probe pulse , to also measure the vibrational component of the optical nonlinearity .",
    "the nonlinear response can be explored using single - beam experiments @xcite , but pump - probe techniques allow direct time - resolved observation of the response @xcite or the response reconstructed with an auxiliary model for the pump spatio - temporal dependence @xcite .",
    "single - shot techniques , in particular , eliminate laser pulse - to - pulse fluctuations as a source of error @xcite . however , it is crucial in pump - probe experiments to properly account for two - beam coupling effects , as we recently showed for plasma and rotational nonlinearities @xcite .",

    "the sc pulse is strongly chirped ( see later ) and split into probe and reference pulses separated by 2 ps , which are then collinearly combined with an 800 nm pump beam using a dichroic mirror , with the reference pulse earliest in time and the pump and probe pulses temporally overlapping .",
    "the collinear pulses propagate through either a thin laser - drilled stainless steel gas flow tube in a vacuum chamber , or through the backfilled chamber without the tube .",
    "the probe pulse picks up the wavelength - dependent phase and amplitude change induced in the h@xmath0 or d@xmath0 gas by the intense pump pulse , which are then extracted from the spectral interference pattern collected in an imaging spectrometer , which also provides transverse 1d spatial resolution ( @xmath18-direction ) . the absolute nonlinear change in refractive index @xmath19",
