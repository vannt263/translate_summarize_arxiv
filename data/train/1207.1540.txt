    "the quantum tunneling of a system with intrinsic degrees of freedom , or of many particles , is an important subject of modern physics@xcite . in nuclear physics ,",
    "typical examples include heavy - ion fusion reactions at subbarrier energies@xcite , spontaneous fission@xcite , alpha and heavy - cluster decays@xcite , and stellar nucleosynthesis@xcite . in heavy - ion fusion reactions , for instance",
    ", it has been well recognized that the couplings of the relative motion between the colliding nuclei to several collective motions enhance the tunneling probability of the coulomb barrier , thus increasing the fusion cross sections , by several orders of magnitude as compared to a prediction of a simple potential model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has still been a challenging problem to understand the many - particle tunneling from a fully microscopic view .",
    "for instance , even though there have been several attempts @xcite , alpha decays have not fully been understood microscopically with sufficient accuracy .",
    "recently , two - proton ( 2_p _ ) radioactivities have been experimentally observed for a few proton - rich nuclei outside the proton drip - line , such as @xmath0fe @xcite and @xmath1be @xcite , and have attracted much attention @xcite in connection to _",
    "e.g. , _ the dinucleon correlations @xcite .",
    "this is a phenomenon of spontaneous emission of two valence protons from the parent proton - rich nuclei , in which the emission of one proton is energetically forbidden .",
    "notice that an analogous process of the two - proton radioactivity , that is , a two - neutron decay has also been observed recently for @xmath2be@xcite .",
    "these two - nucleon emission decays may provide a useful testing ground of many - particle tunneling theories .",
    "a primary task for a many - particle tunneling decay is to investigate the effect of interaction or correlation among emitted particles on decay properties such as the decay width and the survival probability . in the case of decay",
    ", this corresponds to the pairing correlation between the valence protons . because of the strong pairing correlation in proton - rich nuclei",
    ", emitters are expected to have an even number of protons outside the proton drip - line .",
    "incidentally , it has been well known that the pairing correlation plays an important role in two - neutron transfer reactions @xcite .",
    "the quantum tunneling decay phenomena can be studied either with the time - independent approach @xcite or the time - dependent approach @xcite . in the time - independent approach , one seeks _",
    "e.g. , _ a gamow state , which is a purely outgoing wave outside the barrier . the imaginary part of the energy of the gamow state is related to the decay width , while the real part corresponds to the resonance energy . on the other hand , in the time - dependent approach , one first modifies the potential barrier so that the initial state can be prepared as a bound state of a confining potential .",
    "the confining potential is then suddenly changed to the original barrier , and the initial state evolves in time .",
    "the decay width can be obtained from the survival probability of the initial state .",
    "an advantage of the time - independent approach is that the decay width can be calculated with high accuracy even when the decay width is extremely small @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the time - dependent approach , on the other hand , is that it provides an intuitive way to understand the tunneling decay , even though it may be difficult to apply it to a situation with an extremely small decay width .",
    "this approach may provide a useful means to explore the mechanism of many - particle tunneling decay , though it has so far been applied only to two - body decay phenomena , such as @xmath3 decays and one - proton decays @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the time - dependent approach to two - proton emissions and discuss the dynamics of a two - particle tunneling decay . to this end",
    ", we employ the one - dimensional three - body model @xcite , which consists of a heavy core nucleus and two valence protons .",
    "we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation by expanding the wave function on a basis with time - dependent expansion coefficients .",
    "the decay width is then defined from the survival probability .",
    "we shall study the time evolution of the survival probability as well as the density distribution .",
    "we shall also discuss the role of pairing correlation in the two - proton decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we detail our formalism for the time - dependent approach to the two - proton decays .",
    "we show the results of the calculations in sec .",
    "it will be shown that the decay width converges to a constant value after a sufficient time evolution , indicating that the decay rate follows the exponential law . with this method",
    ", the time - evolution of a quasi - stationary state , namely the density and the flux distributions , can be visualized . using them",
    ", we shall discuss an important role of the pairing interaction between the two protons in the decay process .",
    "finally we summarize the paper in sec .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional three - body system with two valence protons and the core - nucleus whose atomic and mass numbers are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "neglecting the recoil kinetic energy of the core nucleus , the three - body hamiltonian reads @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the nucleon mass , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the coordinates of the valence protons with respect to the core nucleus .",
    "@xmath10 is the potential between a valence proton and the core , whereas @xmath11 is the interaction between the two valence protons .",
    "the core - proton potential , @xmath12 consists of the nuclear part @xmath13 and the coulomb part @xmath14 .",
    "for the nuclear part , we take a woods - saxon form , @xmath15 for the coulomb part , we employ a soft - core coulomb potential@xcite , that is , @xmath16 in this paper we take @xmath17 mev .",

    "we have employed the time - dependent method and investigated many - particle tunneling decays , particularly the two - proton radioactivity . to this end , we have used a one - dimensional three - body model which consists of a core nucleus and two valence protons . in order to describe the decaying process , we first confined the two - proton wave function inside a confining potential .",

    "we have found that an emission of a bound diproton is enhanced due to the pairing correlation , as was evidenced in the time evolution of the density and flux distributions .",
    "we have also analyzed the partial probabilities and discussed the relative importance of the sequential and simultaneous two - proton decays .",
    "we have shown that , for the uncorrelated case , the sequential decay is the dominant decay process , while the simultaneous decay plays an essential role in the case of strong pairing correlation . for an intermediate value of the pairing strength",
    ", we have shown that both the simultaneous and the sequential two - proton emission coexist .",
    "the one - dimensional three - body model which we employed in this paper is a simple schematic model , with which a deep understanding of many - particle decay process may be obtained .",
    "one drawback , however , is that two protons are inevitably bound even with an infinitesimal attraction between the two protons .",
    "even though our model nicely demonstrates the coexistence of the simultaneous and sequential decays for an intermediate pairing interaction , in reality two protons are never bound in vacuum .",
