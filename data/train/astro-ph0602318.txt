    "since the first applications of absorption line indices as a diagnostic tool for studying stellar populations in early - type galaxies , it was found that some of these evolved and dynamically relaxed objects contain a non - negligible population of young stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of this ` frosting ' of young stars within a galaxy was then largely uncertain , given the difficulties in measuring spatially - resolved absorption - line strengths . with the advent of integral - field spectroscopy , it is however now possible to obtain high - quality ` maps ' of absorption - line strength distributions within galaxies ( e.g. see @xcite , these proceedings ) , and in turn , maps of luminosity - weighted age , metallicity and abundance ratio by applying modern stellar population models .        from such stellar population maps , it is evident that many galaxies showing globally young ages also tend to show centrally concentrated young components .",
    "figure [ fig : mcdermid_fig1 ] shows a clear example of this in the dusty s0 galaxy ngc3032 .",
    "the top row shows the mean stellar age , derived from maps of line - strength indices ( h@xmath1 , fe5015 , mg_b _ , and fe5270 ) observed with sauron ( left ) and oasis ( right ) , using the single - burst stellar population ( ssp ) models of @xcite , where the ssp which best reproduced the multiple observed indices was found at each position .",
    "the galaxy shows rather young ages across the whole field , but shows a distinct decrease in age in the central @xmath2 radius .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ fig : mcdermid_fig1 ] show the corresponding velocity maps for this galaxy from the same two instruments .",
    "the increased spatial resolution of the oasis observations reveals a small ( 3.5@xmath3  pc diameter ) kinematically decoupled component ( kdc ) , which coincides with the location of the central young population .    combining the available sauron and oasis data",
    ", we find a number of galaxies within our sample which contain similar small ( @xmath4 few hundred parsec ) , young ( @xmath4 5 gyr ) kdcs , several of which are only resolved with oasis .",
    "figure [ fig : mcdermid_fig2 ] shows the distribution of kdc size ( estimated from the velocity maps ) against the mean luminosity - weighted age measured within the central arcsecond of the galaxy ( where light from the kdc is assumed to dominate ) for all e / s0 galaxies in the sauron sample which show a clear kdc ( i.e. neglecting co - rotating components ) . from this figure , we see that intrinsically large ( @xmath5 1kpc ) kdcs tend to be rather old , and the compact kdcs tend to be young , although they cover a range in age .",
    "moreover , the large kdcs are found exclusively in galaxies showing low global angular momentum , which we term ` slow rotators ' ; the small kdcs on the other hand inhabit ` fast rotators ' , which show significant net rotation",
    ". the young kdcs are also generally counter - rotating systems , sharing almost the same rotation axis as the outer parts ( within @xmath6 in most cases ) .",
    "why are the small kdcs mostly young ?",
    "figure [ fig : mcdermid_fig3 ] shows that , of the fast rotating galaxies in the sauron sample , five of the seven youngest objects ( @xmath7  gyr ) show a counter - rotating core , and one of these has yet to be observed with high spatial resolution , and so may yet reveal a kdc",
    ". only one of the remaining thirteen objects older than 5  gyr shows a detectable kdc .    is the counter - rotation significant in producing the young stars ? there are also galaxies showing young / intermediate - aged global and central populations , but which do nt show strong substructure in their velocity fields .",
    "are these ` single component ' systems fundamentally different ?",
    "figure [ fig : mcdermid_fig4 ] shows a possible answer to these questions . using the measured central line - strengths from one of our young kdc galaxies , we constrain the amount of mass of young stars that can be added to a background ` base ' population ( assumed to be that of the main body of the galaxy ) within the central aperture . taking the example of ngc4150 ,",
    "we add 8% _ by mass _ of a 0.5  gyr population on a 5  gyr base population , to give a combined h@xmath1 absorption strength of @xmath8   .",
    "we simulate a two - component velocity field using a fourier expansion technique similar to the ` kinemetry ' method of @xcite .",
    "we assign these velocities at each position to ssp model spectra of @xcite , assigning the young population to the kdc component , and make the mass - weighted combination of spectra .",
    "the simulated data cube is then spatially binned using a voronoi tessellation @xcite , and the kinematics were extracted using the penalised pixel fitting technique of @xcite .",
    "the result is a realistic - looking kdc velocity field .",
    "we then hold the mass fraction fixed , and ` evolve ' the populations in step . as the kdc population ages , its mass - to - light ratio increases , resulting in a dimming of the kdc stars .",
    "the effect is to ` fade ' the kdc into the background rotation field , as the luminosity - weighted contribution becomes less significant .",
    "after 5  gyr , the kdc is barely visible .",
    "this helps explain the apparent lack of intermediate and old aged small kdcs .",
    "the importance of counter - rotation is harder to address .",
    "the middle row of figure [ fig : mcdermid_fig4 ] uses the same kinematic components and populations as the top row , but in this case the subcomponent is co - rotating .",
    "the impact of the co - rotating component on the total observed velocity field is clearly more subtle , and the component becomes difficult to separate from the background field after only @xmath9  gyr .",
    "for this reason , the intrinsic distribution of co- and counter - rotating central young components could be rather similar , but since the co - rotating cases can only be clearly identified at young ages , our sample of young galaxies is currently too small to answer this question satisfactorily .",
