    "one reason is ` endosymbiosis ' : the incorporation of one organism together with its genetic material into another , as probably happened with the mitochondria in our cells and also the plastids that hold chlorophyll in plants .",
    "another is ` horizontal gene transfer ' : the passing of genetic material from one organism to another , which happens frequently with bacteria .",
    "so , the tree of life is really a thicket , as shown in this figure @xcite :    1em    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horizontal_gene_transfer [ ]    but a tree is often a good approximation , especially for animals and plants in the last few hundred million years .",
    "biologists who try to infer phylogenetic trees from present - day genetic data often use simple models where :    * the genotype of each species follows a random walk , but * species branch in two at various times .",
    "these are called ` markov models ' .",
    "the simplest markov model for dna evolution is the jukes  cantor model @xcite .",
    "consider one or more pieces of dna having a total of @xmath10 base pairs .",
    "we can think of this as a string of letters chosen from the set \\{a , t , c , g } :    @xmath11 atcgattgagctctagcg @xmath11    as time passes , the jukes  cantor model says the dna changes randomly , with each base pair having the same constant rate of randomly flipping to any other .",
    "so , we get a markov process on the set @xmath12 however , a species can also split in two .",
    "so , given current - day genetic data from various species , biologists try to infer the most probable tree where , starting from a common ancestor , the dna in question undergoes a random walk most of the time but branches in two at certain times .    to formalize this , we can define a concept of ` phylogenetic tree ' .",
    "our work is based on the definition of billera , holmes and vogtmann @xcite , though we use a slightly different definition , for reasons that will soon become clear . for us , a phylogenetic tree is a rooted tree with leaves labelled by numbers @xmath13 and edges labelled by ` times ' or , geometrically speaking , ` lengths ' in @xmath14 .",
    "we require that :    * the length of every edge is positive , except perhaps for ` external edges ' : that is , edges incident to the leaves or root ; * there are no 1-ary vertices .",
    "for example , here is a phylogenetic tree with 5 leaves : @xmath15 ( 0,0 ) edge ( 0,1 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( -1.5,4 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( 0,4 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( 1,2 ) ( 2,3 ) edge ( 1,4 ) ( 2,3 ) edge ( 2,4 ) ( 1,2 ) edge ( 3,4 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 but we demand that @xmath17 . we draw the vertices as dots .",
    "we do not count the leaves and the root as vertices , and we label the root with the number @xmath18 .",
    "we can not collapse edges of length zero that end at leaves , since doing so would eliminate those leaves .",
    "also note that the embedding of the tree in the plane is irrelevant , so this counts as the same phylogenetic tree : @xmath19 ( 0,0 ) edge ( 0,1 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( -1.5,4 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( 0,4 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( 1,2 ) ( 2,3 ) edge ( 1,4 ) ( 2,3 ) edge ( 2,4 ) ( 1,2 ) edge ( 3,4 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ]    in applications to biology , we are often interested in trees where the total distance from the root to the leaf is the same for every leaf , since all species have evolved for the same time from their common ancestor .",
    "these are mathematically interesting as well , because then the distance between any two leaves defines an ultrametric on the set of leaves @xcite .",
    "however , more general phylogenetic trees are also interesting  and they become essential when we construct an operad whose operations are phylogenetic trees .    let @xmath20 be the set of phylogenetic trees with @xmath3 leaves .",
    "this has a natural topology , which we explain in section [ section : phylogenetic_topology ] .",
    "for example , here is a continuous path in @xmath21 where we only change the length of one internal edge , reducing it until it becomes zero and we can collapse it : @xmath22 \\node ( 1 ) at ( 0,1){$\\bullet$ } ; \\node ( 2 ) at ( 2,2){$\\bullet$ } ; \\node ( 3 ) at ( -2,2){$\\bullet$ } ;   \\node at ( 0,-1.5){$0 $ } ; \\node at ( -3,4.5){$1 $ } ; \\node at ( -1,4.5){$2 $ } ; \\node at ( 1,4.5){$3 $ } ; \\node at ( 3,4.5){$4 $ } ; \\node at ( 1.3,1.2){$1 $ } ; \\node at ( -1.3,1.2){$1 $ } ; \\node at ( -3.1,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( -0.9,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( 3.1,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( 0.9,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( -0.8,-0.1){$1.2 $ } ; \\node at ( 5,1.5){$\\leadsto$ } ; \\path[-,font=\\scriptsize ] ( 0,-1 ) edge ( 0,1 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( 2,2 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( -2,2 ) ( -2,2 ) edge ( -3,4 ) ( -2,2 ) edge ( -1,4 ) ( 2,2 ) edge ( 1,4 ) ( 2,2 ) edge ( 3,4 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture } \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5 ] \\node ( 1 ) at ( 0,1){$\\bullet$ } ; \\node ( 2 ) at ( 1.5,1.5){$\\bullet$ } ; \\node ( 3 ) at ( -2,2){$\\bullet$ } ;   \\node at ( 0,-1.5){$0 $ } ; \\node at ( -3,4.5){$1 $ } ; \\node at ( -1,4.5){$2 $ } ; \\node at ( 1,4.5){$3 $ } ; \\node at ( 3,4.5){$4 $ } ; \\node at ( 1.05,0.9){$0.5 $ } ; \\node at ( -1.3,1.2){$1 $ } ; \\node at ( -3.1,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( -0.9,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( 3.1,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( 0.6,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( -0.8,-0.1){$1.2 $ } ; \\node at ( 5,1.5){$\\leadsto$ } ; \\path[-,font=\\scriptsize ] ( 0,-1 ) edge ( 0,1 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( 1.5,1.5 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( -2,2 ) ( -2,2 ) edge ( -3,4 ) ( -2,2 ) edge ( -1,4 ) ( 1.5,1.5 ) edge ( 1,4 ) ( 1.5,1.5 ) edge ( 3,4 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture } \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5 ] \\node ( 1 ) at ( 0,1){$\\bullet$ } ; \\node ( 3 ) at ( -2,2){$\\bullet$ } ;   \\node at ( 0,-1.5){$0 $ } ; \\node at ( -3,4.5){$1 $ } ; \\node at ( -1,4.5){$2 $ } ; \\node at ( 1.5,4.5){$3 $ } ; \\node at ( 3.5,4.5){$4 $ } ; \\node at ( -1.3,1.2){$1 $ } ; \\node at ( -3.1,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( -0.9,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( 3.1,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( 0.3,3){$0.6 $ } ; \\node at ( -0.8,-0.1){$1.2 $ } ; \\path[-,font=\\scriptsize ] ( 0,-1 ) edge ( 0,1 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( -2,2 ) ( -2,2 ) edge ( -3,4 ) ( -2,2 ) edge ( -1,4 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( 1.5,4 ) ( 0,1 ) edge ( 3.5,4 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ]    phylogenetic trees reconstructed by biologists are typically binary .",

    "the idea is that the abstract operations in @xmath7 are realized as actual operations on the space @xmath36 .    in this paper",

    "we can also think of @xmath38 as a linear map @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath3th tensor power of @xmath40 .",
    "we also need ` coalgebras ' of operads .",
    "the point is that while ordinarily one thinks of an operation @xmath28 as having @xmath3 inputs and one output , a phylogenetic tree is better thought of as having one input and @xmath3 outputs .",
    "a coalgebra of @xmath7 is a finite - dimensional real vector space @xmath40 on which operation @xmath28 gives a linear map @xmath44 obeying the same conditions as an algebra , but ` turned around ' .",
    "the main point of this paper is that the phylogenetic operad has interesting coalgebras , which correspond to how phylogenetic trees are actually used to describe branching markov processes in biology . but to understand this , we need to start by looking at coalgebras of two operads from which the phylogenetic operad is built .    by abuse of notation",

    "we shall see that any markov process on @xmath36 makes @xmath51 into a coalgebra of @xmath2 .",
    "this handles the markov process aspect of dna evolution ; what about the branching ? for this we use @xmath1 , the unique operad with one @xmath3-ary operation for each @xmath55 .",
    "algebras of @xmath1 are not - necessarily - unital commutative algebras : there is only one way to multiply @xmath3 elements for @xmath55 .    for us",

    "the unique @xmath3-ary operation of @xmath1 acts as the linear map @xmath56 where @xmath57",

    "it is clear that given any markov process on a finite set @xmath36 , the vector space @xmath51 naturally becomes a coalgebra of this operad .",
    "the reason is that , as we have seen , @xmath51 is automatically a coalgebra of @xmath1 , and the markov process makes it into a coalgebra of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , by the universal property of a coproduct , it becomes a coalgebra of @xmath64 .",
    "we prove this in theorem [ thm : coalgebra_of_phyl ] .    since operads arose in algebraic topology , it is interesting to consider how the phylogenetic operad connects to ideas from that subject .",
    "boardmann and vogt @xcite defined a construction on operads , the ` @xmath35 construction ' , which when applied to the operad for spaces with an associative multiplication gives an operad for loop spaces .",
