    "now we proceed to examine the second implicit condition .",
    "if the noisy state observation is available non - causally at the encoder , the gelfand - pinsker theorem @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",

    "indeed , it is known @xcite that , when @xmath86 , the ratio of @xmath51 to @xmath50 is at least 0.942 and the difference between these two quantities is at most @xmath3000.011 bit ; in other words , the gain that can be obtained by exploiting the encoder side information ( or the loss that can be incurred by ignoring the encoder side information ) is very limited anyway .",
