    "our understanding of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in disordered solids is based on the scaling theory of localization @xcite .",
    "we believe that mit is universal .",
    "it means that the system - size dependence of any quantity , say conductance @xmath1 , is determined only by one parameter .",
    "the validity of the one parameter scaling was tested and confirmed in the neighborhood of the critical point by various numerical simulations on quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) systems @xcite . however , a detailed analytical theory of mit is still missing .",
    "their formulation is complicated also by absence of the self - averaging of the conductance in disordered systems at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "complete description of transport properties requires therefore a detailed analysis of the conductance distribution @xmath0 .",
    "such theory exists only in the weak disorder limit .",
    "the weak disorder expansion@xcite , dorokhov - mello - pereyra - kumar equation ( dmpk ) @xcite , and the random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite provide us with entire quantitative description of the transport statistics",
    ". however , critical regime never appears in the weak disorder limit .",
    "for the critical regime , analytical results for the conductance statistics were derived only in dimensions slightly above the lower critical dimension @xmath2 with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these can not be extrapolated to three dimensional systems ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "our information about the critical regime in 3d systems is therefore based only on numerical simulations .",
    "the shape of the conductance distribution at the critical point was analyzed @xcite and one - parameter scaling of the mean conductance was numerically proven in @xcite .",
    "recently , an attempt has been made to obtain relevant information about the critical regime from studies of the weakly disordered q1d systems @xcite .",
    "although q1d systems do not exhibit critical phenomena ( correlation length never diverges ) their transport properties resemble that observed in 3d systems : ( 1 ) in the metallic regime when the system length @xmath5 is shorter than the localization length @xmath6 , both rmt and the dmpk equation predict that @xmath0 in q1d systems is gaussian with a constant , disorder independent width .",
    "this was numerically observed also for squares ( 2d ) @xcite and cubes ( 3d ) @xcite . only the variance of conductance depends on the dimension @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) in the limit of very long system length , @xmath7 , q1d samples become insulating , in spite of weak disorder .",
    "rmt predicts that the distribution of @xmath8 is gaussian and var log @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "log - normal distribution was observed also in 2d and 3d strongly disordered systems @xcite .",
    "the dimension - dependence of the variance var log @xmath1 is , however , not understood .",
    "( 3 ) in the intermediate regime , where @xmath10 , analytical relation for the conductance distribution can be obtained @xcite .",
    "its shape is similar to that obtained numerically at the critical point of mit @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the differences between the conductance distribution for q1d weakly disordered systems and for 3d cubes . as",
    "the metallic limit is already good understood both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite we concentrate to the critical regime ( @xmath10 ) and the strongly localized regime ( @xmath11 .",
    "although the distributions are qualitatively similar in each transport regime , quantitative differences will be found .",
    "we show that statistics of the conductance depends on the dimension in the critical and even in the localized regime .",
    "this must be taken into account in the entire description of the transport .",
    "our analysis of the statistical properties of parameters @xmath12 , which are defined by eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) below , confirms the validity of the one - parameter scaling theory in the insulating regime .    in section 2",
    "we describe the model we use .",
    "section 3 presents numerical data for the conductance distribution in the intermediate ( critical ) regime .",
    "the shape of the distribution in the three dimensional localized regime is studied in detail in section 4 .",
    "we consider anderson model defined by the hamiltonian @xmath13 }    counts the sites in @xmath14-dimensional lattice and @xmath15 are nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the size of the lattice is either @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) or @xmath18 .",
    "random energies @xmath19 are distributed with the box distribution @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the strength of the disorder .",
    "our analysis of the conductance distribution is based on the landauer formula for the conductance @xcite [ g ] g= tr   t^t= _ 1^n^-2(z_i/2 ) in ( [ g ] ) , @xmath22 is the transmission matrix , and the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , the parameterize the eigenvalues of @xmath25  @xcite . in the limit @xmath26",
    ", parameters @xmath12 converge to lyapunov exponents of the transfer matrix .",
    "@xmath27 is the number of open channels @xcite .    according to ( [ g ] )",
    ", statistics of the conductance is completely determined by statistical properties of the parameters @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that in weakly disordered systems the spectrum of @xmath12 is linear [ linear ] z_ii independently on dimension and shape of the sample@xcite . the linear behavior ( [ linear ] ) can be derived also from the random matrix model @xcite and was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to prove of the universality of conductance fluctuation @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that weakness of the disorder is not only necessary but also sufficient condition for the linear form of the spectra ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "relation ( [ linear ] ) holds therefore for any weakly disordered q1d systems independently on the system length @xcite .",
    "this is not true when disorder increases .",
    "thus , we have numerically proven that [ kvad ] z_i^d-1i w = w_c . at the critical point of mit in dimension @xmath28 and 4 .",
    "relation ( [ kvad ] ) holds for both q1d @xcite and 3d @xcite systems . in 3d , it enables us to understand the dimension - dependence of the conductance distribution at the critical point @xcite .",
    "the form of the spectra of @xmath12 for strongly disordered systems is known for the q1d samples @xcite .",
    "an attempt was made to study @xmath12 for 2d and 3d strongly disordered systems @xcite .",
    "we present here much more accurate data for parameters @xmath12 , which enable us to estimate the contribution of higher channels to the conductance .",
    "three - dimensional anderson model with a box distributed disorder exhibits mit at the critical point @xmath29 .",
    "we calculated the conductance distribution for ensembles of three - dimensional cubes with disorder @xmath30 .",
    "the system size was @xmath31 which is large enough to exhibit quantitative properties of the conductance distribution .",
    "calculated shape of @xmath0 is compared with the conductance distribution for weakly disordered q1d systems of the size @xmath32 .",
    "the disorder @xmath33 assures the existence of the metallic regime for short @xmath5 , @xmath34 .",
    "the localized regime appears when @xmath5 exceeds 250 .",
    "tuning the length @xmath5 we find for each 3d ensemble the corresponding q1d ensemble with the same mean conductance .",
    "a comparison of the conductance distribution of 3d and q1d systems is presented in figures [ fi1 ] , [ fi1a ] and [ fi3 ] . in the metallic regime , when @xmath35 , @xmath0 is gaussian in both 3d and q1d geometry , as supposed ( fig . [ fi1]a ) .",
    "the width of the distribution is universal , independent on the system size .",
    "it depends only on the system shape , and is slightly smaller for q1d than for 3d systems , in agreement with theoretical results @xcite .",
    "figures 1 ( b - e ) present the shape of @xmath0 in the critical regime , when @xmath36 . we know that @xmath0 for 3d systems becomes non - analytical at @xmath37 and decreases exponentially when @xmath38 @xcite . the same is true also for q1d systems in the intermediate regime @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 decreases for @xmath38 much faster than predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "the exponential decrease in q1d is even faster than that in 3d systems .",
    "this is because for a given @xmath39 the difference @xmath40 is much smaller in 3d than in q1d , as follows from the comparison of ( [ linear ] ) with ( [ kvad ] ) .",
    "higher channels have therefore a better chance to contribute to the conductance in 3d than in q1d .",
    "figure [ fi1a ] presents the conductance distribution for 3d anderson model at the critical point ( @xmath29 ) and for 2d and q1d systems with the same mean conductance . as supposed , 3d distribution posses the longest tail , while two q1d - distributions are almost identical . from the plot of the @xmath41 ( data not shown in the paper )",
    "we conclude that all four distributions are identical for small @xmath1 .",
    "this is not surprise since the small -@xmath1 behavior is determined completely by the distribution of @xmath42 , which is the same in all systems .",
    "the quantitative difference between the conductance distribution for cubic and q1d systems is measured by the integral i(1)=_1^p(g ) dg in figure [ fi2 ] we plot @xmath43 as a function of the mean conductance @xmath44 for various geometrical shapes of systems . for q1d systems",
    ", we calculated both @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath26 ) . the data lay on the same curve .",
    "this is no surprise since the spectrum of @xmath12 is linear in both systems .",
    "a similar universality was found in 2d system . here",
    ", we either increase disorder with constant system size or increase the size of square samples keeping disorder constant . as supposed , the data for 3d and 2d systems scales independently .",
    "the figure [ fi3 ] compares @xmath41 for 3d and q1d systems in localized regime .",
    "it confirms that @xmath41 converges to gaussian both for 3d and q1d systems .",
    "the distribution for q1d systems is much broader than that for 3d .",
    "while the shape of @xmath41 in weakly disordered q1d systems can be obtained analytically @xcite , distribution for 3d systems is known only from numerical simulations @xcite and deserves more detailed analysis .",
    "in the insulating regime all @xmath12 increase linearly with the system length .",
    "the length - dependence of @xmath42 determines the localization length @xmath6 [ locl ] z_1(l)=+const ( for q1d systems , @xmath47 should be replaced by @xmath5 ) .",
    "the knowledge of the spectrum of parameters @xmath12 is important also in the insulating regime .",
    "as mentioned above , the spectrum of @xmath12 remains linear in weakly disordered q1d systems @xcite so that @xmath48 .",
    "contrary to q1d systems , we find that the difference @xmath40 increases only logarithmically with the system size for 2d systems ( figure [ fi4 ] ) : [ log ] z_2-z_1~cl .",
    "the same logarithmic behavior was found also in the 2d systems with spin - orbit scattering ( data are not presented here ) .    in 3d systems",
    "we find that the differences @xmath40 and @xmath49 do not depend on the system size in the strongly localized regime : [ threed ] z_2- z_1 in figure [ fi5 ] we present the @xmath42-dependence of the difference @xmath40 for the 2d and 3d systems .",
    "for @xmath42 large enough , data scale to the same curve , confirming the one - parameter scaling .",
    "more important , data prove that the spectrum of the transfer matrix depends on the dimension of the sample in the localized regime .",
    "figure [ fi6 ] presents the @xmath42 - dependence of the differences @xmath50 for @xmath51 and 5 . although the convergence is worse for higher differences , the saturation to the @xmath42-independent constant is clearly observable as @xmath42 increases .    due to ( [ threed ] ) ,",
    "the contribution of the second channel is nonzero whichever is the contribution of the first one .",
    "this contribution , however gives only small correction to the first channel contribution @xmath52 .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to test how the contributions of the higher channels influence the statistical properties of the conductance .",
    "we found that apart the shift of the mean value the distribution @xmath53 and the distribution @xmath54 are almost identical .",
    "although the absolute value of the conductance changes only slightly due to the contribution of higher channels , the present effect influences the variance of the log @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the small difference @xmath55 causes that @xmath42 is confined from above : the probability to find @xmath56 is much less in the 3d than in the q1d .",
    "the width of the distribution of @xmath42 and of @xmath8 is therefore narrower in 3d than in in the q1d",
    ". this agrees with numerical data presented in figure [ fi3 ] .",
    "note also an asymmetry of the distribution : the probability to find @xmath57 is higher than the probability to find @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .    to support one - parameter scaling by more quantitative arguments we analyzed also statistical properties of the parameters @xmath12 .",
    "contrary to weakly disordered q1d systems , we have to take into account also mutual correlations of @xmath42 and higher @xmath12 in 3d .",
    "it is therefore not clear in advance , whether or not the one - parameter scaling theory is valid in this regime .",
    "however , figure [ fi5 ] shows that the differences @xmath50 are unambiguous functions of @xmath39 .",
    "validity of the one - parameter scaling in the localized regime is confirmed also by the data in figure [ fi4 ] which shows that var @xmath42 is an unambiguous function of the mean value @xmath39 in 2d even when disorder is strong .",
    "the same seems to hold also for 3d systems ( figure [ fi7 ] ) in figure [ fi7 ] we present also the @xmath60-dependence of var log @xmath1 . in the last case",
    "we find deviations from scaling only when the localization length @xmath6 becomes comparable with inter - atomic distance ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we analyzed also systems with non - zero fermi energy .",
    "this was motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite , where separate var @xmath12 _ vs _ @xmath62 - relations were found in systems with different fermi energy .",
    "our present data , however , scale to the same curve as that for the zero fermi energy ( figure [ fi7 ] ) .",
    "however , we can not guarantee that more detailed statistical analysis will not show small deviations from the one - parameter scaling , similar to that observed in one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "we have shown numerically that the shape of the conductance distribution depends on the system dimension when the system leaves metallic regime . qualitative explanation of this difference is based on the known spectra of the parameters @xmath12 . in weakly disordered quasi - one dimensional systems",
    "the spectrum of @xmath12 is linear independently on the dimension and the system length .",
    "however , in the cubic @xmath14-dimensional samples the spectrum depends on the dimension of the system when the disorder increases .",
    "we presented and compared the conductance distributions for q1d and 3d systems in the intermediate ( critical ) regime .",
    "for both of them we found non - analytical behavior in @xmath37 and exponential decrease of @xmath0 for @xmath38 .",
    "the distributions differ only quantitatively .",
    "we have shown for the first time that the differences @xmath40 increase logarithmically with the system size in two - dimensional strongly disordered systems . in three dimensional strongly disordered systems",
    "the differences @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constant and independent on the system size and on the strength of the disorder .",
    "is agrees with previous results @xcite .",
    "the contributions to the conductance from the first , the second and higher channels have therefore the same system - size dependence @xmath65 . although the contribution of higher channels to the mean conductance is small , the shape of the spectra of @xmath12 influences strongly the form of the distribution of the @xmath8 , which becomes narrower in 3d than in the weakly disordered quasi - one dimensional systems .",
    "the one - channel approximation is therefore not sufficient for the entire description of the insulating regime in three dimensions .",
    "our numerical data confirm that @xmath66 , @xmath67 together with var @xmath42 are unambiguous functions of @xmath42 .",
    "we believe therefore , that , in spite of the non - linearity of the spectrum of @xmath12 , the random matrix theory can be generalized to the description of the non - metallic systems @xcite .",
    "such a generalization would approve applicability of the one - parameter scaling theory both to the critical and the strongly insulating regime .",
