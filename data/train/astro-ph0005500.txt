    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ ph_gem ]    the middle - aged geminga pulsar has been already detected with the ground - based ( cfht , eso 3.6 m , ntt ) and hst telescopes in different bands and presently it is one of the well - studied pulsars in the the optical domain ( see , e.g. , bignami  &  caraveo , 1996 , mignani , 1998 ) .",
    "it has been concluded that the optical emission of geminga seems to be thermal with a broad emission feature at 6000 .",
    "jacchia ( 1999 ) suggested a rough model to explain the observed excess of geminga s emission in the v - band as emission of hot ions in the strong magnetic field near the ns surface .",
    "the results of geminga s spectroscopy ( martin et al , 1998 ) with tentative detection of an apparent absorption feature at 6400are generally consistent with the photometry . in figure  1 we present our images of the geminga field in the b , v , r@xmath0 bands taken on march , 1997 and in the i@xmath0 band on january 19 , 1999 .",
    "the pulsar position in the v and r images is indicated with arrow .",
    "the objects suggested to be geminga candidates at the first observations of this field in the optical range ( halpern &  tytler , 1988 ) are marked with letters g and g@xmath5 .",
    "the photometry both of the pulsar optical counterpart ( g@xmath6 ) and the mentioned field objects yields the magnitude estimates , which are presented in table [ ph_gem ] .",
    "the obtained geminga flux distribution is in a good agreement with the data published so far . in figure  [ gem1 ]",
    "we present the broadband spectrum of geminga based on all optical data available .",
    "filled circles correspond to our results , and arrows with bars to the i and f675w upper limits .",
    "our observations of the geminga field in the i - band were tentative and we could not get so deep images as had been done before ( bignami , 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the fading of geminga s flux at these wavelengths is still unconfirmed .    in all the optical bands ( excluding",
    "the i one ) the optical fluxes exceed the rayleigh - jeans extrapolation of the thermal spectrum seen in the euv and soft x - rays ( dashed line in figure  [ gem1 ] ) .",
    "such a spectrum behaviour is similar to that of the psr b0656 + 14 and probably can be also fitted by combination of both a magnetospheric and a thermal component .      like geminga ,",
    "the pulsar b0950 + 08 has been previously detected .",
    "the field of this pulsar was observed with the hst in the uv - optical range using the long - pass filter f130lp ( @xmath7 ) ( pavlov , 1996 ) .",
    "the only pointlike source was detected in the image of @xmath8 in size ( @xmath9 = 27.1 ; f = @xmath10 ) .",
    "its location does not coincide with the radio pulsar position .",
    "the difference in positions is about @xmath11 , that may be caused by systematic uncertainties in the hst guide star catalogue ( up to @xmath12 ) , which is used for hst astrometric referencing , as well as by uncertainties in the pulsar radio position ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the field of this pulsar was observed with the 6 m telescope in the r band of the cousins system on march , 1997 and january , 1998 .     in radius , corresponds to the accuracy of our astrometry.,width=302 ]    there are not enough reference stars from usno catalogue in this field ( approximately @xmath14 in size ) , that makes an accurate astrometry impossible .",
    "to improve the situation we used the image of this field ( @xmath15 ) taken with the zeiss-600 telescope of sao ras .",
    "this enabled us to increase the accuracy of the astrometrical referencing of the bta images up to @xmath12 . in figure  [ psr0950 ] we present an image of psr b0950 + 08 neighbourhood , positions of the radio pulsar ( small cross ) , the uv - opical candidate ( big cross ) and the possible optical counterpart ( in circle )",
    "are indicated .",
    "an object ( @xmath16 ) has been found in the combined image , and its position differs by @xmath17 from the pulsar radio position . in case the detected object is indeed the pulsar , this discrepancy may be due to two reasons : different epochs of the radio and optical observations with the lack of reliable data on the pulsar proper motion , and uncertainties both in our astrometry and the pulsar radio position .",
    "the object magnitude is @xmath18 , corresponding flux is @xmath19 .",
    "upper levels on the flux of undetected sources ; dashed line reflects the blackbody spectral fit for radiation from entire ns surface for the distance @xmath20 = 130  pc and ns radius of 13  km ( pavlov , 1996 ) .",
    ", height=377 ]    figure  [ sp0950 ] shows photometric data of the possible psr b0950 + 08 counterpart based on the 6 m telescope ( r - band ) and hst ( f130lp ) observations .",
    "if the observed object is the pulsar optical counterpart its r - magnitude shows that old pulsars may be brighter in near - ir than in near - uv region .",
    "this is in opposite to the expected spectral behaviour and can not be explained by thermal emission only .",
    "more observations are needed .",
    "psr j0108 - 1431 was discovered during a survey of the southern sky for pulsars using the parkes 64 m radio telescope ( tauris , 1994 ) . in accordance with the galactic electron distribution density model ( taylor  &  cordes , 1993 ) the low dispersion measure suggests that this pulsar is within 90  pc from the sun .",
    "thus this is the closest known neutron star , but it is quite old , @xmath21yrs . the pulsar has not been detected in any high - frequency range .",
    "figure  [ psr0108 ] represents images of the psr j0108 - 1431 neighbourhood taken with the 6 m telescope on august 1999 .",
    "no object coinciding with the radio pulsar in position was detected and we obtained the following 3@xmath3-limits for the observed pulsar magnitudes : b @xmath22 ; v @xmath23 ; r@xmath0 @xmath22 ; i@xmath0 @xmath24 .",
    "further observations of this field might yield the detection of the ins optical counterpart .",
    "the pulsar psr j1908 + 0746 was discovered at the arecibo observatory during the search for pulsars of low luminosity using the 305 m radio telescope ( camilo  &  nice , 1995 ) . for its characteristic age",
    "this is old pulsar , while the rotational energy loss @xmath25 is rather high . in the absence of an unequivocal theory of the high - energy emission of pulsars , a high level of @xmath26",
    "is used as a rough indicator of likelihood that high - frequency emission from a pulsar can be detected ( see , e.g. , goldoni  &  musso , 1996 ) .",
    "search for the emission in the high - frequency domain from pulsars with the highest values of @xmath26 ( @xmath2740 pulsars including psr j1908 + 0746 ) yielded the detection of x - rays from 27 pulsars ( becker  &  trumper , 1997 ) and the @xmath28-rays from 4 pulsars ( thompson , 1994 ) .",
    "no high - frequency emission has been found so far from psr j1908 + 0746 ( becker  &  trumper , 1997 ) .",
    "the field of this pulsar was observed in bvr@xmath0i@xmath0 bands on july and august , 1999 .",
    "the obtained images are shown in figure  [ psr1908 ] .",
    "the photometry yields the following 3@xmath3 upper limits for the observed pulsar magnitudes : b @xmath29 , v @xmath30 , r@xmath0 @xmath31 , i@xmath0 @xmath32 . as this rather distant pulsar lies almost in the galactic plane ,",
    "its dereddened flux values can be derived only after an accurate study of the interstellar extinction towards the pulsar position .",
    "the deep photometric study of the psr b0656 + 14 at the 6 m telescope has shown that the broadband spectrum of this middle - aged pulsar is significantly of nonthermal origin ( kurt , 1998 ; koptsevich , 2000 ) .",
    "its complicated shape differs from flat and featureless spectra of young crab - like pulsars and can not be explained by a simple spectral model ( pavlov , 1997 ; kurt , 1998 ; koptsevich , 2000 ) .",
    "similar behaviour , confirmed by our observations , shows the spectrum of the slightly older pulsar geminga . some doubt still remains how deep is the fall of geminga s flux redward of r and whether its depth is restricted by the emission level of the thermal component .",
    "more observations , including the ir - range , are needed to address this question .",
    "nevertheless , current stage of the optical studies allows us to suggest that the optical spectra of these middle - aged nss are likely to be very different from those of young ones and may hint the spectral evolution of the optical emission with the pulsar age .",
    "the detection of the optical emission from the old pulsar psr b0950 + 08 , if proposed counterpart candidate is confirmed by further observations , may contribute to the above idea .",
    "the apparent excess in the r - band may indicate the presence of spectral feature at these wavelengths and raise a question whether thermal component is dominant in the optical emission of old neutron stars ( @xmath33 yrs ) , which is expected from the scenario of inss evolution .",
    "thus , search for optical counterparts to old pulsars and cooling inss detected in x - rays may be of great importance .",
    "we have observed the fields of the pulsars j0108 - 1431 and j1908 + 0734 for the first time .",
    "although no optical counterparts have been found , the estimated magnitude upper limits suggest deeper observations of the fields of these promising objects",
    ". however , the optical emission of psr j1908 + 0734 seems unlikely to be detected in the b and v bands due to extinction .    the search for optical emission of more inss with the subsequent multicolour photometric study is needed to shed light on the mechanisms of their optical emission , to put constraints to the parameters of both thermal and nonthermal components , to enrich our knowledge of the ns interior and draw a real picture of the neutron star evolution .",
    "the work on pulsar study was partially supported by grant 1.2.6.4 of program `` astronomia '' , by intas ( grant 960542 ) and rfbr ( grant 99 - 02 - 18099 ) .",
