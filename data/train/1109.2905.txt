    "[ janicesample ] , we show a comparison between the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios from @xcite ( navy and grey points ) with those of the 185 galaxies considered in this study ( navy points only ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 , fuv , and b - band fluxes , as well as the adopted dust corrections in this figure have all been taken from @xcite .",
    "although similar in most aspects , there are two notable difference between the samples .",

    "second , our sample contains fewer low luminosity systems than the larger sample of @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the limiting factor is the lack of sufficient ancillary data . in the case of the low luminosity galaxies , nearly all that have been excluded from the present study lack sufficiently homogenous optical broadband coverage . for more luminous galaxies , some lack either ancillary optical imaging or fall outside the boundaries of the lvl survey and therefore lack _ spitzer _ imaging .",
    "we next examine the differences in h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios between the two samples . in table",
    "[ samplediffs ] , we quantify the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios as a function of h@xmath0  sfr , after applying identical extinction corrections from @xcite ( see  [ duscor ] ) .",
    "as expected , the largest difference is seen at high h@xmath0  sfr , where our sample lacks galaxies with high h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios . for @xmath11",

    "similarly , the 1@xmath12 scatter over the same range is @xmath1 0.1 dex lower in the present sample .",

    "the two samples are in general agreement .",
    "this indicates that possible selection effects associated with the smaller sample in this study are minimal .",
    "for accurate comparison of h@xmath0  and fuv sfr indicators , corrections are required for extinction due to both galactic foreground and to internal effects in each galaxy .",
    "we correct for foreground extinction using the maps of @xcite , assuming the milky way extinction law of @xcite . for internal attenuation , we use two types of corrections : the first based on direct ir measurement of reprocessed light and another using correlation - based prescriptions ( e.g. , see appendix d in @xcite ) .    for @xmath1 70% of the sample , we have estimates of the total - ir flux based on spitzer / mips far - ir ( fir ) measurements , allowing us to use the ` energy balance ' extinction correction methods derived by @xcite for h@xmath0  and by @xcite for fuv .",
    "these methods derive an intrinsic luminosity from the combination of unobscured ( e.g. , h@xmath0 , fuv ) and obscured ( i.e. , fir continuum ) signatures of star formation .",
    "from the intrinsic luminosity one can correct for the effects of internal dust attenuation on the observed h@xmath0  and fuv fluxes .",
    "for the @xmath1 30% of the sample where fir measurements were not available , we used the same correlation - based attenuation corrections as @xcite , namely a @xmath13-band luminosity prescription for @xmath14 and a dust - law prescription for @xmath15 .",
    "while both methods are anchored to balmer decrement extinction corrections , the self - consistency of the ` energy balance ' method along with the availability of ir for the majority of our sample make it an appealing choice for this study .",
    "more explicitly , the ` energy balance ' extinction correction for @xmath14 from @xcite is :    @xmath16    and from @xcite , the correction for the fuv is given as :    @xmath17    where the tir luminosity is a mips - based measurement made using the conversion in @xcite :    @xmath18    overall , our internal extinction corrections yield similar results to those used by @xcite .",
    "as shown in table [ samplediffs ] , the main difference between the two sets of corrections is seen for the most luminous galaxies in the sample . here , @xcite find the mean h@xmath0-to - fuv ratio to be @xmath1 0.2 - 0.3 dex below the expected fiducial , whereas the energy balance dust corrections place the mean ratios within @xmath1 0.05 dex of the fiducial .",
    "however , for galaxies with low h@xmath0  sfrs , the adopted extinction correction does not drastically influence the mean or scatter in the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios ; these galaxies have low dust contents , such that extinction corrections have only modest impacts on their luminosities .",
    "we plot the flux ratios for our sample with the energy balance extinction corrections applied in figure [ hasfrmb ] .",
    "although differences in dust corrections are both important and interesting in their own right , analyzing the impact of various extinction corrections on sfr indicators is beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "instead , we refer the reader to @xcite , which investigates the reliability and consistency of various h@xmath0  and fuv extinction corrections , including those from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ".      the stellar mass for each galaxy in the sample was derived by spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting as detailed in @xcite , which closely follows the methods detailed in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we fit the observed uv , optical data , and ir luminosities of each galaxy with a suite of @xcite population synthesis models , whose parameters span a range in stellar metallicity , age , exponentially declining sfhs , and dust properties . for each model , we derive a stellar mass from the best fitting normalization of the model sed",
    ". we also construct the cumulative distribution function for the stellar mass from the likelihoods of the normalized model seds for each sample galaxy .",
    "the stellar masses reported here are the medians of the cumulative distribution function . in practice ,",
    "the stellar mass is surprisingly robust , as the effects of dust and age on the optical mass - to - light ratio have correspondingly similar effects on the observed optical color @xcite , while the effects of stellar metallicity on the optical mass - to - light ratios are minimal .",
    "the derived stellar masses for each system are presented in table [ tab1 ] .    the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratio as a function of galaxy stellar mass ( figure [ obs_data ] ) shows subtle , but important differences compared to when the ratios are plotted versus h@xmath0  sfr or @xmath9 , as in figure [ hasfrmb ] .",
    "for example , when considering the ratios versus h@xmath0  sfr , we see there are no galaxies with h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios above the fiducial for @xmath19 $ ] @xmath4 @xmath102.5 .",
    "additionally , there are only a few galaxies with h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios near or above the fiducial for systems with @xmath9 @xmath4 @xmath1013 . from these two panels",
    ", one could conclude that galaxies with low luminosities or low current sfrs must have systematically low h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios .    however , when plotting the same ratios versus stellar mass , one could reach a different conclusion . as shown in the top panel of figure [ obs_data ] , a number galaxies with masses @xmath4 10@xmath5 m@xmath6  have h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios near or above the fiducial .",
    "recent bursts of sf have little impact on a galaxy s total mass , but can strongly influence the observed h@xmath0  or optical luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , considering the data versus total stellar mass minimizes the covariances that affect the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios when plotted versus luminosity .      a similar study conducted by @xcite found a strong trend between @xmath2-band surface brightness ( @xmath20 ) and h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios . to facilitate a direct comparison , we utilize @xmath2-band imaging from either sdss or lvl , and follow the surface brightness measurement procedure described in @xcite .",
    "below , we briefly summarize the methodology .",
    "we first masked foreground stars and background galaxies identically to the method described in @xcite . with these objects removed , we computed the surface brightness profiles using elliptical apertures .",
    "the major and minor axes of a measurement aperture are scaled , preserving ellipticity , such that the ellipse encloses 50% of the total flux .",
    "we then normalized the total flux to the area of the aperture to derive the surface brightness .",
    "particular care was taken to ensure that these scaled measurement apertures , constructed using ellipticity and position data compiled from ned / simbad , were properly shaped and centered .",
    "for consistency with @xcite , we note that the flux percentage choice of 50% rather than 90% does not affect the overall trends in our data , beyond shifting to slightly higher surface brightnesses .",
    "we plot the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios versus @xmath2-band surface brightness ( @xmath20 ) in the bottom panel of figure [ obs_data ] .",
    "again , we see a decline in h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios toward lower surface brightness systems . in this case , the systematic decline of h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios is not as strong as when the sample is plotted versus h@xmath0  sfr , but is still more evident than when the ratios are considered versus galaxy stellar mass . like all optical luminosities , @xmath2-band fluxes are known to vary due to episodes of recent sf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which likely explains at least some of the correlation between h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios and @xmath20 .",
    "we note that the observed trend between h@xmath0-to - fuv ratio and @xmath2-band surface brightness in our sample is not quite as strong as that presented in @xcite , which we have over - plotted as the red dotted line in figure [ obs_data ] .",
    "we discuss some of the potential reasons for this disagreement in  [ previous ] .",

    "the model sfhs we consider in this analysis are simple toy models that are primarily composed of periodic bursts superimposed onto a constant sfr .",
    "given that modest variations in the period , duration , and amplitude of bursts can result in significantly different h@xmath0 , uv , and broadband fluxes , we consider a diverse and extensive set of @xmath1 1500 model sfhs , whose properties and construction we describe below .",
    "we model sfhs that focus on two separate regimes : the ancient epoch ( @xmath22 1 gyr ago ) which has little impact on the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios and recent sfhs ( @xmath30 1 gyr ago ) which are characterized by a mix of constant sf and bursts .",
    "we have modeled the older stellar populations that dominate a galaxy s total stellar mass using a 1 gyr burst of sf 8 gyr ago to populate the red giant branch and ancient main sequence , as well 1 gyr of constant sfr from 1 - 2 gyr ago to account for the contribution of asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "the precise epoch of the ancient and intermediate age sfhs do not significantly change any of our analysis . changing the ages of these older bursts results in small variations in the absolute values of @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath4 0.5 dex . however , because the same ancient and intermediate sfhs are used for all models , there is no effect on the relative values of @xmath31 .",
    "finally , to match findings from measured sfhs in nearby dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we scaled the sfhs such that sf from @xmath22 1 gyr ago accounts for 90% of the total stellar mass formed in each model .",
    "we constructed the recent model by assuming a constant sfr over the past 1 gyr and superimposing bursts of sf .",
    "we assume the bursts to be a 1 myr long episode of constant sf , which we then interpolated onto a finer time grid to track the evolution of h@xmath0  and uv fluxes over longer timescales .",
    "this basis model was then shifted in time , multiplied by the appropriate amplitude , and finally linearly co - added with other basis models to obtain the desired recent sfh .",
    "each model has a specified burst amplitude ( a ; the ratio of maximum sfr to constant sfr ) , burst duration ( d ) , and period between bursts ( p ) .",

    "we proceed to discuss these findings alongside predictions from the model sfhs analyzed in this paper .",
    "we first consider the case of a universal , but not fully sampled imf .",
    "the effect of this stochastically sampled imf scenario on the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratio has been simulated in @xcite . assuming a constant sfh , the authors found that the predicted turnover in h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios occurred at too low an h@xmath0  luminosity relative to the data ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) .",

    "this result is confirmed by more recent simulations in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in each paper , the authors verify the inability of random sampling of the imf to account for the observed trend in h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios , under the assumption of a constant sfh and a fully populated cluster mass function .",
    "instead , each study demonstrates that stochastic sampling of _ both _ the stellar and cluster mass functions are necessary to produce h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios that are consistent with observations .",
    "the effect of stochastically sampling the cluster mass function is that lower mass galaxies form massive clusters less frequently than higher mass systems . along the same lines",
    ", stochastically sampling stellar imf implies that high mass stars have a higher probability of forming in high mass clusters . in light of these scenarios",
    ", we would then expect low mass galaxies to form fewer high mass clusters , and hence fewer high mass stars when compared to more massive galaxies .",
    "therefore , low mass systems would have fewer massive stars capable of producing h@xmath0 , and the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios in low mass systems is expected to be less than for more massive galaxies .",
    "crucially , these models posit that the formation of massive clusters in low mass galaxies are rare , but not impossible , which is the case for certain prescriptions of a variable imf ( see  [ igimf ] ) . more detailed discussion and quantitative analysis of these effects can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the second possibility we consider is that the imf is not universal .",
    "this scenario has been widely debated in the literature , but a consensus has yet to be reached ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we discuss on the validity of this assumption below .    as a first comparison ,",
    "we follow the discussion of the igimf in @xcite , and over - plot predictions for the ` standard ' and ` minimum1 ' igimf models ( solid and dashed navy lines ) on the observed h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios versus h@xmath0  luminosity in the top panel of figure [ igimf_comp ] .",

    "the broad dispersion of h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios predicted by the model sfhs are generally in good agreement with the observations .",

    "in particular , for galaxies with stellar masses @xmath4 10@xmath59 m@xmath6 , there are a substantial number of galaxies that have h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios significantly above the igimf predictions .",

    "* ) , extrapolating the current h@xmath0  sfr to a constant lifetime sfh to determine the stellar mass is not a valid assumption . in the event that we have _ over - estimated _ the galaxy stellar mass , the igimf curves would shift to the left in the bottom panel of figure [ igimf_comp ] . in order to match",
    "the mean observed flux ratios , the extrapolated galaxy masses need to be decreased by a factor of @xmath1 10 .",
    "even with this correction applied , the igimf curves still do not match the observed scatter in the data very well .",
    "the second area of uncertainty is the connection between the igimf and assumed form of the sfh .",
    "both the ` standard ' and ` minimal1 ' igimf models assume a constant sfh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "including the effects of a bursty sfh may be able to produce h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios higher than currently predicted . as seen from the model sfhs , during the early phases of a burst , the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios are near their peak .",
    "combining this mechanism with the igimf provides at least one possible explanation for galaxies with higher than predicted h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios",
    ".    however , the convolution of bursts with the igimf is not without complications .",
    "first , if bursts are required to explain h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios above the igimf predictions , this implies that all such galaxies are currently in the midst of a burst .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that the majority of low mass galaxies in our sample should be undergoing simultaneous bursts .",
    "second , under the auspices of the igimf , one also needs to consider the absolute sfr , not just the relative burst amplitudes . at low absolute sfrs such as 10@xmath60 m@xmath6  yr@xmath61",
    ", the igimf model predict that @xmath42 $ ] is @xmath1 @xmath101 . extrapolating this sfr over 13.7",

    "we see a handful of galaxies with @xmath42 $ ] @xmath7 0 .",
    "the only way for such low mass galaxies to have these high h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios is through intense bursts of sf that significantly increase the amount of h@xmath0  emission .",
    "additionally , we note that such bursts should not be too long in duration or too high in frequency or the final mass of the galaxy could be substantially increased .",
    "overall , we find that bursty sfh models can qualitatively account for the general decline and scatter in the observations as a function of decreasing h@xmath0  luminosity or galaxy stellar mass , whereas the simplest form of the igimf models do not .",

    ", we have found a set of sfh models that match the trend and scatter in observed h@xmath0-to fuv ratios .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    determining the degree to which any model sfh truly reflects those in nature is a challenging and presently unresolved question .",
    "a comprehensive assessment of the realistic nature of the model sfhs used in this paper is beyond the scope of this study , but is the subject of future work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "instead , in this section we outline the limitations of the simple model sfhs and discuss ways in which future sfh model efforts can be improved .",
    "one increasingly common method of directly measuring sfhs is from analysis of color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in figure [ real_sfhs ] , we show an example of six such sfhs measured from cmds based on hubble space telescope imaging of dwarf galaxies in the m81 group @xcite .",
    "the solid black and dot - dashed magenta lines represent the same sfh binned to different time resolutions , which we discuss below .",
    "these measured sfhs provide an indication of the complexity of galaxy - wide star formation .",
    "the most striking characteristic in these measured sfhs is the degree of stochasticity in the amplitude and duration of star formation episodes .",
    "further , there is no clearly defined period associated with any of the measured sfhs .",
    "there is also a conspicuous lack of stochasticity in the model sfhs ( e.g. , figure [ sample_sfhs ] ) .",
    "clearly , non - uniform parameterization of bursty sfhs is an important next step toward constructing more realistic sfhs .",
    "of course , there is some degree of similarity between the modeled and measured sfhs .",
    "focusing on the most recent 100 myr ( insets in figure [ real_sfhs ] ) , where the time resolution of the cmd - based sfhs is the highest , a handful of bursts with amplitudes of @xmath1 10 - 50 are present in the measured sfhs , similar to those found in the highest probability models for low mass galaxies .",
    "the measured sfhs also suggest that extended duration , high amplitude bursts ( e.g. , @xmath63 100 myr , @xmath64 50 ) are probably not common . burst durations of hundreds of myrs have been measured in a minority of starburst dwarf galaxies @xcite , but with average burst amplitudes of less than a factor of 5",
    ". however , these global , long duration bursts are superimposed with a short timescale ` flickering ' of enhanced sf , which result in short - term burst amplitudes @xmath7 10 on 10 myr timescales .",
    "average burst amplitudes in these systems are typically a factor of a @xmath4 5 over the course of hundreds of myr , although variations in the sfrs on timescales of order @xmath1 10 myr can vary by factors of 10 or more",
    ". determinations of exact amplitude and duration parameters directly from cmd - based sfhs are challenging due to the logarithmic time resolution of the measured sfhs .",
    "we explicitly illustrate the issue at hand in appendix [ timeres ] .",
    "integrated fluxes provide further empirical constraints for sfh modeling efforts",
    ". a realistic set of model sfhs should be able to reproduce such observations as the distribution of observed h@xmath0  ews , the uv luminosity function , and optical broadband colors and luminosities .",
    "the simple model sfhs we consider are not in strong agreement with either observed distributions of either h@xmath0  ew or uv luminosity , as presented in @xcite and @xcite . while both the model and observed distributions are well described by lognormal functions , the functional form of the model predictions has too many galaxies near the median value and not enough at the extremes . some of the difference can be reconciled by increasing the simulated noise in the models , but we would prefer to avoid this type of fine - tuning .",
    "further , the addition of stochasticity would also mitigate the over - density of galaxies near the median of the distribution .",
    "quantitatively testing these effects is beyond the scope of this paper , but is discussed in the context of the slug population synthesis code @xcite .",
    "we have compared predictions from simple , periodic sfhs with observed h@xmath0-to - fuv sfr ratios observed as part of the 11hugs and _ spitzer _ lvl programs . from a suite of @xmath1 1500 simple model sfhs",
    ", we have identified a set of models that matches the observed distribution of h@xmath0-to - fuv sfr ratios over a range of galaxy stellar masses .",
    "we find that high mass galaxies tend to have characteristic sfhs that are predominantly constant , with relatively modest amplitude bursts ( @xmath34 @xmath4 10 ) spaced by @xmath1 100 myr .",
    "we find that lower mass galaxies are best described by sfhs with burst amplitudes of @xmath1 30 , and inter - burst spacings of @xmath1 150 - 200 myr .",
    "these model sfhs have burst amplitudes that are comparable to those inferred from cmds of nearby star forming dwarf galaxies .    using results from the highest probability models , we compared the predicted evolution of the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios versus stellar mass , @xmath2-band surface brightness , sfr(h@xmath0 ) , and @xmath9 , and found that in all cases , the models were in good agreement with observations .",
    "we find that highest probability models are well matched to the observed systematic decline in the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios as a function of both decreasing h@xmath0  luminosity and decreasing galaxy stellar mass .",
    "variations in the high mass stellar imf have been proposed as an explanation for this trend .",
    "we therefore compare predictions from the model sfhs with those from the igimf theory , which also makes specific predictions for h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios . from this comparison",
    "we see that stochastic sampling of the imf can not re - produce the observed trend .",
    "a convolution of stochastically sampled stellar and cluster mass functions are necessary to match observations .",
    "we find that both the sfh and igimf predictions are in good agreement with the h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios as a function of h@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "however , when considered versus stellar mass , it is not clear if the igimf allow for h@xmath0-to - fuv ratios higher than the predicted curves , whereas the model sfhs naturally account for the observed scatter .    instead ,",
    "the we find that only time variable sfhs are able to explain both the mean trend in the data , as well as the scatter .",
    "while we have only considered toy model sfhs , they share characteristics with the stochastically sampled cluster and stellar mass function scenario presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "essentially , at low sfrs , a stochastically sampled cluster mass function rarely produces massive clusters .",
    "however , when a massive cluster does form , the sfr of the galaxy increases , and can effectively look like a burst of sfh . while the frequency of massive cluster formation in low mass galaxy is not well understood , the new population synthesis code , slug @xcite will permit investigations on the impact of stochastic cluster formation on the galaxy wide sfh and broadband flux properties .",
    "finally , we discuss the limitations of our toy model sfhs , including the assumptions of periodicity and lack of stochasticity . in addition",
    ", we find that one major challenge is understanding differences between our model predictions and observations of the h@xmath0  and uv luminosity functions , as well as precisely matching observed optical and nir galaxy luminosities . exploring these differences are one of the topics that will be explored in the upcoming paper of @xcite .",
