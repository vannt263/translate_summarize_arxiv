    "neutron capture on a proton , @xmath3 is one of the key reactions for big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , because this process is the bottleneck to the synthesis of light elements .",
    "predictions of the abundances of primordial light elements such as @xmath4 , @xmath5he , @xmath6he , and @xmath7li , and their comparison with observations are crucial tests of the standard big - bang cosmology . on the theoretical side , because of the relative simplicity of the objects under consideration , the processes provide important test grounds for our understanding of nuclear dynamics . in spite of these importances , it is hard to realize the @xmath8 process at bbn energies in the laboratory due to its tremendously small probability .",
    "an alternative method is to consider the inverse process @xmath2 .",
    "the process is more feasible in the laboratory conditions because the deuteron targets and photons with bbn energies are easily available relatively .",
    "in addition , the dynamics involved in the process are exactly the same to those in @xmath8 , so the process is useful to understand bbn and nuclear forces .    at the bbn energy scale",
    ", strong interactions may be mostly mediated by the exchange of pions .",
    "since the energies involved in the bbn processes are much smaller than the mass of pions , one can treat the exchange of pions in terms of effective contact interactions .",
    "contact interactions thus treated include the contributions of not only pions , but also heavy mesons and multi - meson exchanges .",
    "counting rules , which allow to classify the significance of a given term order by order , constitute a perturbative expansion scheme for the effective strong interactions at low energies . theories thus constructed are called pionless effective field theory ( eft(@xmath9 ) ) @xcite , and we employ a modified version of pionless theory , so called pionless theory with dibaryon fields ( deft ) @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations are commonly utilized for effective experiments plan and results analysis .",
    "geant4 ( geometry and tracking ) @xcite is a simulation tool kit written in the c++ language which allows microscopic simulations of the propagation of particles interacting with materials .",
    "it is being widely and successfully used in many different scientific fields , such as neutron shielding studies @xcite , medical physics @xcite , accelerator - based radiation studies @xcite , environment radiation detection studies @xcite , and etc . however , one of the authors ( jws ) recently reported that built - in hadronic models of geant4 ( v10.0 ) failed to describe peaks that are produced through the @xmath10be(p , n)@xmath10b reaction in low energy region @xcite .",
    "geant4 was originally built for high - energy physics , and hadronic models of geant4 have been made for wide use . and",
    "thus , the authors developed a new data - based charge exchange model for @xmath11be(p , n)@xmath11b reaction , and could achieve good agreement with experimental data .",
    "since an deft is based on perturbative expansions , in principle one can improve the theoretical results to any accuracy one requires .",
    "if deft is incorporated in a simulation tool like geant4 , one can increase the accuracy of the simulation in a controlled and systematic way .",
    "for this reason , we construct an deft - based hadronic model of geant4 for the @xmath2 reaction .",
    "similar to the @xmath10be(p , n)@xmath10b reaction , an existing model of geant4 ( v10.1 ) shows non - negligible discrepancies in the total cross sections of @xmath2 . as a first attempt to merge defts with geant4 , we simulate the total and differential cross sections of the @xmath2 process by using geant4 with deft ( g4deft ) at various energies and angles , and compare the results with available experimental data .",
    "the result will prove usefulness of the combination of deft with geant4 .",
    "for an application of the model , we also calculate the neutron yields from the @xmath12 reaction .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section  ii ,",
    "we address more details about deft , and exhibit analytic formulae relevant to the results shown in the following sections . in section  iii , we present the results for the cross sections in @xmath2 with g4deft , and compare them with diverse experimental data .",
    "also , we propose experiments from which we can test the usefulness and predictive power of g4deft . we summarize the work in section  iv .",
    "efts , which provide us a systematic perturbative scheme and a model - independent calculation method , have become a popular method to study hadronic reactions with and without external probes at low and intermediate energies . in low - energy processes ,",
    "typical momenta are much smaller than the mass of the pion ( @xmath13 ) , which is the lightest meson that mediates strong interactions ; thus it is natural to treat pions as heavy particles and integrate out the pions in the theory .",
    "this is called eft(@xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "its advantage is that the perturbative expansion is directly manifested in the physical observables like cross sections , and their analytic forms are available .    to perform a sensible perturbative expansion ,",
    "a small expansion parameter is required . in eft(@xmath9 ) , it is given by the pion mass ( or nucleon mass ) and the typical small momentum scale .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom are nucleons and non - hadronic external currents .",
    "massive hadronic excitations such as pions and the delta resonance are not dynamical .",
    "their contributions are encoded in the contact interactions between nucleons .",
    "thus interactions are calculated perturbatively with the small expansion parameter .",
    "a more effective and convenient method was suggested by kaplan @xcite .",
    "large scattering lengths signal the presence of a state that is weakly bound or almost bound . through the inclusion of a dibaryon field that represents a weakly bound state ( @xmath14 channel ) or an almost bound state ( @xmath15 channel ) of two nucleons",

    "this implies that the contribution of the deuteron in these energy ranges is negligible . however , striking differences happen around @xmath139 mev for @xmath129 mev , and @xmath140 mev for @xmath95 mev , where high and broad peaks appear .",
    "number of neutrons per an incident photon can be obtained by integrating the yield curves in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] with respect to @xmath128 .",
    "ratio of the neutron number for @xmath129 mev to that for @xmath95 mev is obtained as @xmath141 .",
    "this number is very similar to the ratio of the total cross section of @xmath2 process , 2.29 , which is obtained from the total cross sections 1.44 mb for @xmath88 = 9.8 mev , and 0.63 mb for @xmath88 = 19.8 mev .",
    "the similarity of two ratios is an evident proof that the peaks in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] are originated from interactions of photons and deuterons .    in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] , we show the angular distribution of the neutron yield .",
    "maximum values are located around @xmath142 = @xmath143 , which is in agreement with the behavior of the differential cross section of @xmath2 process , fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "this coincidence proves again that most of the neutrons in the peak are emitted from the deuterons in cd@xmath125 .",
    "angular distribution for @xmath95 mev is relatively broader than that for @xmath144 mev , which is one of reasons why we have a peak broader for @xmath145 mev than for @xmath130 mev in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] .",
    "angles around @xmath117 show the best efficiency for the detection of neutrons . in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] , we plot the energy distribution of the emitted neutrons at @xmath146 .",
    "there are very sharp peaks at @xmath139 mev for @xmath130 mev , and @xmath140 mev for @xmath95 mev . if one treats the scattering process @xmath2 classically and calculates the energy of outgoing neutrons in the laboratory frame , one can easily obtain @xmath147 mev and 8.7 mev for @xmath130 mev and 19.8 mev , respectively .",
    "coincidence of these values and the position of peaks provides a signal for the dominance of @xmath148 reactions in the emission of neutrons .",
    "with the development of effective field theories and lattice qcd in nuclear physics , the accuracy to describe and understand the few - nucleon systems is being improved unprecedentedly .",
    "the improvement will make it possible to have more precise results for the simulations in which few - nucleon processes will contribute non - negligibly .",
    "our work started from the question how we can embed the progress of the nuclear theory for few - nucleon systems in the simulations of nuclear processes .",
    "first we checked the validity of an existing model g4emextraphysics which accounts for the photonuclear interactions in geant4 ( v10.1 ) by calculating the total cross section of @xmath2 process .",
    "we found that the g4emextraphysics model gives null result for the total cross section of the process below pion threshold .",
    "as a way to resolve the problem and enhance the predictive power of simulations , we incorporated analytic results of a dibaryon effective field theory in geant4 .",
    "the new model has been checked thoroughly by calculating total and differential cross sections of the @xmath2 process below pion threshold , and comparing the results with available experimental data .",
    "results of the model has turned out to agree well with the experimental data within the uncertainties of the approximations of the theory . in the next step ,",
    "the model has been applied to the calculation of yield of neutrons emitted from cd@xmath125 bombarded by photons .",
    "since no experimental datum is available for the observable , only the comparison between the new and the existing models was made .",
    "two models show critical difference in the prediction of the neutron yield .",
    "the measurement , if performed , will provide criterions about to what accuracy and extent the model is valid and applicable .",
