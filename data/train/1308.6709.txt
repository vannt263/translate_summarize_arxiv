    "distributed control of multi - agent systems has been receiving a great deal of attention in the recent literature due to its broad applications in a number of areas ; e.g. , see  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the leader - follower tracking problem represents a particular class of distributed control problems which is concerned with the design of control protocols for each agent based only on the information from the nearest neighbours , with the aim to guarantee that states of all followers converge to that of a dynamic leader ; e.g , see  @xcite .",
    "this paper considers the leader - following tracking problem for a class of discrete - time linear multi - agent systems with a high - dimensional leader and undirected communications between followers .",
    "closely related work includes @xcite@xcite .",
    "these references exemplify a common trend in the existing literature , which has a significant focus on consensus of discrete - time multi - agent systems with first or second - order integrator dynamics .",
    "in contrast , consensus tracking for discrete - time multi - agent systems with identical linear higher - order node dynamics was studied in @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite covers the results on consensus tracking for multi - agent systems consisting of first- and second - order integrator dynamics as special cases , respectively .",
    "also , in the majority of the existing papers on this topic , including some of the previously mentioned references , the leader and all the followers are assumed to have identical dynamics models .",
    "this assumption allows one to directly analyze dynamics of the tracking error arising in the corresponding multi - agent networks consisting of closed - loop agent systems . on the contrary , the case where dynamics of the leader and those of the followers have different models ( e.g. ,",
    "are described by state - space equations of different order ) has not received as much attention .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the case where dynamics of the leader are more complex than those of the followers .",
    "therefore , the existing theoretical approaches for analyzing leader - following tracking problems which have been developed for networks of identical agents can not be directly applied in this case .",
    "furthermore , the state of the leader which evolves independently of the followers is not directly measurable by all of the followers .",
    "it is assumed that only a partial information about the state of the leader can be sensed by a small group of followers which are subject to uncertainty .",
    "thus , the multi - agent system under consideration is more general and contains some other commonly studied classes of leader - following multi - agent systems such as , e.g. , the multi - agent systems in @xcite , as special cases .",
    "the control goal here is to design a tracking protocol for each agent such that the closed - loop system of agents achieves a desired level of @xmath0 leader - following tracking performance .",
    "note that the proposed problem of distributed @xmath0 leader - following tracking for multi - agent systems with a high - dimensional leader is meaningful in a number of practical applications such as the design of distributed sensor networks @xcite where dynamics of the leader are more complex than those of the followers .",
    "the fact that the followers can only sense partial information about the state of the leader prompts us to introduce a dynamic protocol where a local controller together with a neighbor - based state observer is designed for each follower . in the present framework ,",
    "the state observer embedded in the followers performs the task of estimating the unmeasurable states of the leader in a distributed way . under the assumptions that the leader is detectable and the communication topology contains",
    "a directed spanning tree , we propose a procedure for the design of a tracking protocol which involves a solution to a modified algebraic riccati equation .",
    "the analysis of distributed @xmath0 leader - following tracking performance of this protocol when applied to a multi - agent system with a high - dimensional leader is then presented .    the protocol design to achieve a pre - specified level of @xmath0 leader - following tracking performance for a system of agents whose dimension are different form that of the leader is the main contribution of this paper .",
    "we note that dynamic protocols have been considered in a number of recent papers .",
    "for example , a dynamic protocol for synchronization of multiagent systems has been proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "similar to this paper , the analysis in @xcite is based on the reduction of the problem to the analysis of @xmath1 decoupled systems .",
    "however , in contrast to our paper , robust performance issues are not considered in @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that there is another possible way to solve tacking problems under partial information about the leader , by using the distributed output regulation theory and internal model principle @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , some preliminaries from the graph theory and the problem formulation are given .",
    "in section iii , the main results are presented . a numerical example and simulations to illustrate our theoretical analysis are provided in section iv .",

    "accordingly , the state matrix @xmath57 $ ] is in @xmath58 , and admits a compatible partition of the following form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the vector @xmath62 represents the output information about the leader that is made available to the followers for sensing at time instant @xmath63 .",
    "however , as will be seen later , it will be assumed that only a partial information about this vector is sensed by some of the followers .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality it is assumed that @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 , for @xmath66 .",
    "the above model for the leader reflects the common situation where the leader of the group plays the role of a command generator providing reference states to be tracked by the followers .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that the state of the leader evolves in accordance with its intrinsic nominal model and is not influenced by the followers .",
    "the dynamics of the followers , labeled as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , are described by the state equations @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constant matrices , @xmath72 is the control input to be designed , and @xmath73 is a disturbance input .",
    "as mentioned , we assume that some of the followers are able to sense the output of the leader . in a general form",
    ", the output @xmath74 of the leader sensed by the follower @xmath67 , @xmath75 , is expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 , and @xmath78 if and only if the leader is a neighbor of follower @xmath67 .",
    "the matrix @xmath79 characterizes the protocol for information exchange in the network , and @xmath80 .",
    "this reflects the situation where only a partial information about the leader is made available to selected followers .",
    "clearly , if the agent @xmath67 is not connected to the leader , then @xmath81 .",
    "the present framework has several features that distinguish it from similar problems considered in the literature .",
    "firstly , while we assume that the state matrix @xmath82 is known to the followers , though the initial condition @xmath83 is unknown , the leader and the followers have significantly different models in that the states of the leader and the followers have different dimensions , and are also governed by different state matrices .",
    "secondly , the followers employ different output matrices @xmath84 ; the scaling parameters @xmath85 may reflect differences in the strength of the leader s signal received by the followers positioned at a different distance from the leader .",
    "finally , dynamics of the followers are subject to uncertain perturbations .",
    "as is well known , within the @xmath86 framework , such perturbations are often associated with unmodeled uncertain dynamics , and can be used to account for imperfections in the followers models .    in regard to communications between the followers , define the information output of follower @xmath67 to be @xmath87 where @xmath79 is the matrix from equation ( [ outputinformation ] ) .",
    "we will assume that each follower @xmath67 can only use for control the information outputs of its neighbours relative its own output , @xmath88 . as mentioned previously",
    ", the matrix @xmath89 characterizes the protocol for information exchange in the network .",
    "the matrix @xmath89 is in general a rectangular matrix ; this allows for the vectors @xmath88 exchanged between the neighboring followers @xmath67 and @xmath90 to have a lower dimension than their states .",
    "note that all agents are assumed to use the same matrix @xmath89 . as discussed in @xcite , in certain applications ,",
    "using a common communication matrix by all followers is not a significant limitation .    for the notational convenience ,",
    "let is replaced with @xmath91 , and then using this modified matrix instead of @xmath92 in the subsequent derivations . ]",

    "the factor @xmath98 on the right hand side of ( [ relativeinformation ] ) is a weighting factor which scales the actual communication weights between follower @xmath67 and its neighbors into positive scalars within the interval @xmath99 , for each @xmath68 .",
    "note that such scaling technique is commonly used in consensus problems for discrete - time multi - agent systems @xcite .    before closing this section ,",
    "we state the standing assumptions about the structure of the system communication topology .",
    "the first assumption is concerned with interactions between the followers , while the second assumption describes the communication topology between the leader and the rest of the network .",

    "note that assumption [ assumptionundirected ] indicates that the subgraph describing the communication topology between the followers is undirected .",
    "however , this subgraph is not required to be connected in the present framework .",
    "[ assumptionspanningtree ] the communication topology graph @xmath25 contains a directed spanning tree with the leader node being its root .",
    "note that assumption [ assumptionspanningtree ] is not restrictive . for example , it holds when the subgraph describing the communication topology between the followers is connected , and also at least one follower senses the output of the leader .",
    "more generally , when the communication topology between the followers consists of @xmath102 separate connected components , assumption [ assumptionspanningtree ] will be satisfied if each component of the graph includes a node which directly senses the output of the leader .",
    "the control problem in this paper is to design a distributed protocol @xmath103 , @xmath68 , to enable the closed - loop multi - agent system ( [ followerdynamics ] ) , equipped with this protocol , to achieve a prescribed level of @xmath0 leader - following tracking performance .",
    "the mathematical definition of the @xmath0 leader - following tracking performance index will be given later .",
    "to guarantee the @xmath0 leader - following consensus tracking performance , the following observer - based dynamic distributed tracking protocol is proposed for each follower @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the protocol consists of two parts :    * the neighbor - based local controller : @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath61 , are defined in ( [ partition ] ) and @xmath107 is given in ( [ relativeinformation ] ) . *",
