    "recently , hardy @xcite and hardy et al .",
    "@xcite have presented a generalization of hardy s proof of bell s theorem without inequalities for two spin-@xmath0 particles @xcite . neither the original proof nor the ladder generalization and not even the generalizations for the case of two spin-@xmath5 particles proposed in @xcite work for maximally entangled states .",
    "the improvement in the ladder generalization of the two spin-@xmath0 particles case comes from the fact that , adding new observables , the probability for the proof to go through increases .",
    "it grows from 9% of pairs in the original proof with two alternative observables on each particle @xcite to almost 50% of pairs when an infinite number of alternative observables are considered @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i present a similar ladder proof of bell s theorem without inequalities for two spin-@xmath2 particles prepared in the singlet state . in its simplest form ,",
    "treated in section  3 , the proof works for 17% of pairs .",
    "an extended version , considered in section  4 , works for 100% of pairs and uses a finite number of alternative observables . in section  5 ,",
    "i explain how the proof can be extended to any other maximally entangled state of two spin-@xmath2 particles and to any maximally entangled state of two spin-@xmath5 particles ( with @xmath6 ) .",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed ladder proof in order to design a real experiment to test bell s theorem are discussed in section  6 . finally , in section  7 , some differences between ladder proofs of bell s theorem and the proofs of the so - called kochen - specker with locality theorem initially proposed by heywood and redhead @xcite are remarked upon . in order to introduce some notations ,",
    "i begin in section  2 with a brief review of the ladder proof by hardy et al .",
    "the scenario considered by hardy et al .",
    "@xcite is the following : two spin-@xmath0 particles , initially prepared in some specific quantum state , are confined to space - like separated regions of space - time . on the first particle only one measurement @xmath7 chosen from a set",
    "@xmath8 can be made .",
    "each one of these potential measurements has the outcome @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , on the second particle only one measurement @xmath11 from the set @xmath12 can be made to see whether it has the outcome @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "hardy et al .  show that there exist quantum states @xmath15 and sets of measurements @xmath8 and @xmath12 with the following properties : @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 for @xmath20 to @xmath21 . from these properties",
    "we can build a ladder of inferences based on epr condition for elements of reality ( _ `` if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i.  e. , with a probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exist an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity '' _",
    "@xcite ) . this ladder of inferences will conclude in a contradiction .",
    "we start from the proportion , @xmath22 , of pairs in which we get @xmath23 and @xmath24 , given by equation ( [ hardy1 ] ) .",
    "then , using epr condition , we have the following inferences : since , according to ( [ hardy2 ] ) ( ( [ hardy3 ] ) ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) allows us to predict with certainty @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , then @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) was an element of reality . similarly , since @xmath26 ( @xmath25 ) allows us to predict with certainty @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , then @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) was an element of reality , etc .",
    "finally , since @xmath29 allows us to predict @xmath30 and @xmath31 allows us to predict @xmath32 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 were both elements of reality .",
    "therefore , in the state @xmath15 we should have @xmath32 and @xmath30 for at least the proportion @xmath22 of pairs .",
    "but , according to ( [ hardy4 ] ) , we should never get @xmath32 and @xmath30 .",
    "so we reach a contradiction .",
    "in fact , this way of viewing the contradiction is not unique @xcite .",
    "the whole reasoning can be summarized with the aid of some graphs . the graph    ( 90,15 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 60,0 ) ( 30,0)(1,0)30 ( 6,0)@xmath23 ( 69,0)@xmath24 ( 38,5)@xmath22    represents the statement ( [ hardy1 ] ) : the outcomes @xmath23 and @xmath24 occur together with probability @xmath22 .",
    "graphs like    ( 100,10 ) ( 60,0 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 30,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,0)18 ( 69,0)@xmath33 ( 6,0)@xmath34    represent statements like ( [ hardy2 ] ) : if @xmath34 happens then we can predict @xmath33 with certainty .",
    "analogously , graphs like    ( 100,10 ) ( 36,0 ) ( 66,0 ) ( 66,0)(-1,0)30 ( 66,0)(-1,0)18 ( 4,0)@xmath35 ( 75,0)@xmath36    represent statements like ( [ hardy3 ] ) . finally , the graph    ( 90,10 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 60,0 ) ( 30,0)(1,0)30 ( 44,4)(0,-1)8 ( 46,4)(0,-1)8 ( 8,0)@xmath32 ( 69,0)@xmath30    represents the statement ( [ hardy4 ] ) : the outcomes @xmath32 and @xmath30 never occur together . using these graphs , the ladder proofs by hardy et al .  with two , three and @xmath37",
    "settings are represented in figure  1 . for the case of two alternative observables on each particle ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath38 is 9.0% @xcite . adding more observables this value grows . in case of three observables on each particle ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath39 is 17.5% @xcite .",
    "as @xmath21 tends to infinity @xmath40 tends to 50% @xcite . for details on these calculations the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "the name `` ladder '' comes from the fact that the proof uses a chain  of adjustable length  of predictions with certainty .    on the other hand , clifton and niemann @xcite and , recently , ghosh and kar @xcite have proposed generalizations for the case of two spin-@xmath5 particles ( with @xmath41 ) of hardy s original proof .",
    "their generalizations are based on statements similar to ( [ hardy1])-([hardy4 ] ) in which all the measurements @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) correspond to nondegenerate operators ( components of spin ) . in case of two spin-@xmath2 particles , ghosh and kar have found a maximum value for @xmath38 of 13.2% @xcite .",
    "both clifton and niemann s extension @xcite and ghosh and kar s extension @xcite do not work for maximally entangled states .",
    "as far as i know , no ladder proof for maximally entangled states exists .",
    "however , the hilbert space corresponding to a system of two spin-@xmath5 particles , @xmath45 , with @xmath6 , is richer than the hilbert space @xmath46 of two spin-@xmath0 particles . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath6 , we can measure and predict the outcomes of local observables corresponding to degenerated operators .",
    "for instance , in case of two spin-@xmath2 particles , there are sets of three mutually compatible local observables which can be measured on the same run of the experiment . in this paper",
    "i exploit these facts to construct a ladder proof without inequalities of bell s theorem for maximally entangled states of two spin-@xmath2 particles .",
    "the scenario is analogous to the one described in section  2 , changing the two space - like separated spin-@xmath0 particles prepared in a nonmaximally entangled state by two space - like separated spin-@xmath2 particles prepared in the singlet state @xmath47 on the first particle a measurement of the _ square _ of the spin component in some direction @xmath48 , @xmath49 , chosen from a large but specific set of them can be made .",
    "each one of these possible measurements has the outcome @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",

    "( [ dos ] ) , and the corresponding properties obtained by interchanging particle 1 and 2 , will be used in our proof in the same way as properties ( [ hardy2 ] ) and ( [ hardy3 ] ) in the ladder proof for two spin-@xmath0 particles . to summarize this kind of inferences",
    "i shall continue to use the same kind of graphs as in the previous proof .",
    "in addition , in case of two spin-@xmath2 particles in the singlet state , if the outcome of measuring @xmath49 is @xmath50 , then we can predict with certainty that the outcome of measuring @xmath54 , in every direction @xmath55 orthogonal to the direction @xmath48 , will be @xmath51 .",
    "this occurs because @xmath56 ^ 2= \\hbar ^2 \\left|{\\,[{\\bf s}_1\\cdot { \\bf n}_k]^2=0 } \\right . }",
    "\\right)=1\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\forall\\,{\\bf n}_j \\bot { \\bf n}_k\\ , , \\label{tres}\\ ] ] and , consequently @xmath57 and @xmath53 can not be both zero if @xmath55 is orthogonal to @xmath48 , i.  e. , @xmath58",

    "new graphs must be introduced to reflect these new inferences .",
    "for instance , the graph    ( 90,10 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 6,0)@xmath9 ( 60,7.5 ) ( 30,0)(4,1)30 ( 30,0)(4,1)18 ( 69,7.5)@xmath59 ( 60,-7.5 ) ( 30,0)(4,-1)30 ( 30,0)(4,-1)18 ( 69,-7.5)@xmath60    represents the case of two predictions : @xmath9 could be @xmath61 and @xmath59 and @xmath60 could be @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , being @xmath64 and @xmath65 both orthogonal to @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , by interchanging the first and the second particles there are also graphs like    ( 90,10 ) ( 60,0 ) ( 69,0)@xmath13 ( 30,-7.5 ) ( 60,0)(-4,-1)30 ( 60,0)(-4,-1)18 ( 6,7.5)@xmath66 ( 30,7.5 ) ( 60,0)(-4,1)30 ( 60,0)(-4,1)18 ( 6,-7.5)@xmath67    .",
    "property ( [ tresdos ] ) plays the same role as property ( [ hardy4 ] ) in the ladder proof by hardy et al .",
    ", therefore , to represent it i will use the same graph as in section  2 .",
    "moreover , for a spin-@xmath2 particle the observables @xmath68 , @xmath57 , @xmath49 are compatible if @xmath69 , @xmath55 , @xmath48 are mutually orthogonal directions . in fact , their values sum @xmath70 @xmath71 therefore , in the singlet state , if the outcome of measuring @xmath68 is @xmath51 _ and _ the outcome of measuring @xmath57 is @xmath51 then , using ( [ uno ] ) , we can predict with certainty that the outcome of measuring @xmath53 will be @xmath50 , @xmath72 ^ 2=0 \\left|   { \\,[{\\bf s}_1\\cdot { \\bf n}_i]^2=\\hbar ^2\\,\\,\\&\\,\\ , [ { \\bf s}_1\\cdot { \\bf n}_j]^2=\\hbar ^2 } \\right . } \\right)=1\\ , .",
    "\\label{cuatro}\\ ] ] to represent these inferences",
    "i will use a new kind of graph :    ( 90,10 ) ( 60,0 ) ( 69,0)@xmath13 ( 30,7.5 ) ( 6,7.5)@xmath73 ( 30,-7.5 ) ( 6,-7.5)@xmath34 ( 30,7,5)(4,-1)30 ( 30,7.5)(4,-1)18 ( 30,-7.5)(4,1)30 ( 30,-7.5)(4,1)18    . or , interchanging the particles ,    ( 90,10 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 6,0)@xmath9 ( 60,7.5 ) ( 69,7.5)@xmath74 ( 60,-7.5 ) ( 69,-7.5)@xmath36 ( 60,7.5)(-4,-1)30 ( 60,7.5)(-4,-1)18 ( 60,-7.5)(-4,1)30 ( 60,-7.5)(-4,1)18    . to avoid confusion when different kinds of graph appear , note that the latter have thicker lines than the previous graphs .",
    "the proof itself has two parts . in the first part , using a chain of predictions with certainty , i will show that no local realistic interpretation exists for the case in which the outcome of measuring @xmath75 on the first particle is @xmath50 and the outcome of measuring @xmath76 on the second particle is also @xmath50 when the directions @xmath77 and @xmath78 form an angle @xmath79 bound between certain values .",

    "@xmath80 and @xmath82 occur for @xmath114 of pairs . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is not ( yet ) a ladder argument  since it is not apparently extensible  but just a stepladder argument .",
    "the second part uses a particular geometrical situation to improve the conclusion of the previous stepladder argument .",
    "let @xmath77 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 be three mutually orthogonal vectors and let @xmath78 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 be other three mutually orthogonal vectors .",
    "let us define @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 these definitions allow us to easily implement the orthogonality relations between the members of each triad .",
    "these angles could be @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 this particular situation is represented in figure  3 . in that case , the angles @xmath125 , @xmath126 satisfy ( [ siete ] ) but the angle @xmath127 does not .",
    "it is easy to see that all 9 angles between each direction of one triad and all three directions of the other can not satisfy ( [ siete ] ) .",
    "let us go back to physics .",
    "suppose that , with the previous choice of angles , @xmath75 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 are measured on the first particle and @xmath76 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 are measured on the second . since on each particle we will find one @xmath50 and two @xmath51 , then there are 9 different possible results .",
    "on 6 of them , the previous stepladder argument works and therefore , in those cases , no local realistic interpretation exists .",
    "however , the stepladder argument can be eluded when @xmath132 , or when @xmath133 , or when @xmath134 .",
    "the probability for each of these three cases can be computed using ( [ once ] ) with the election for @xmath127 given in ( [ phi1 ] ) . as can be easily checked",
    ", the sum of these three probabilities is @xmath135 . for the remaining @xmath136 of pairs the previous ladder argument goes through .",
    "in fact , it can be proved that this is the maximum value for finding a contradiction , using definitions ( [ malo]-[bueno2 ] ) and if @xmath125 and @xmath126 satisfy ( [ siete ] ) and @xmath127 does not .",
    "in this section i will describe a ladder extension of the previous proof . here",
    "i will present a genuine ladder argument ( i.  e. , with a variable number of steps ) to provide a proof of bell s theorem without inequalities for two particles which works for @xmath4 of pairs",
    ". the strategy will be the same as before .",
    "first i will develop the ladder argument and then i will use an additional geometrical argument to complete the proof .",
    "the ladder argument is completely analogous to the one presented in section  3 , if longer .",
    "in fact , it would be too long to explicitly develop all the steps .",
    "it can be easily followed with the aid of figure  4 . to simplify the diagram , in figure  4",
    "i have sometimes substituted the graph    ( 90,10 ) ( 60,0 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 30,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,0)18 ( 69,0)@xmath36 ( 2,0)@xmath137    with the graph    ( 34,10 ) ( 8,0 ) ( 8,0 ) ( 18,0)@xmath36    : i.  e. , this graph means that if @xmath137 happens then we can predict with certainty @xmath36 .",
    "the rest of the symbols mean the same as in section  3 .",
    "please follow the argument in figure  4 .",
    "note that the basic step of the ladder is composed by 4 predictions on each particle .",
    "for instance , one basic step contains the predictions @xmath80 to @xmath138 and @xmath82 to @xmath139 .",
    "other basic step is the one which includes the predictions @xmath140 to @xmath141 and @xmath142 to @xmath143 .",
    "note also that the initial step ( the one which contains @xmath144 to @xmath137 and @xmath145 to @xmath146 ) and the final step ( the one which contains @xmath32 to @xmath87 and @xmath30 to @xmath94 ) are both a little bit different from the basic steps in between .",
    "the coefficients @xmath147 are @xmath148 and , for @xmath149 , the coefficients can be obtained recursively using @xmath150 or explicitly using @xmath151 therefore , @xmath152 if @xmath153 for @xmath154 , the right - hand side of ( [ ortogonalidad ] ) is bound between @xmath110 and @xmath155 , then ( [ ortogonalidad ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath156 analogously , for @xmath157 , ( [ ortogonalidad ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath158 in general , the right - hand side of ( [ ortogonalidad ] ) is bound between @xmath110 and @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , as @xmath21 tends to infinity , the right - hand side of ( [ ortogonalidad ] ) is bound between @xmath110 and @xmath160 , with @xmath161 , and then ( [ ortogonalidad ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath162 however , for our purposes , we will not need to consider an infinite number of observables .",
    "for the following geometrical argument , the particular case @xmath163 will be of special interest . for @xmath163 , ( [ ortogonalidad ] )",
    "is fulfilled if @xmath164      let us change the particular geometrical situation considered in the second part of section  3 . maintaining the definitions ( [ malo]-[bueno2 ] ) ,",
    "now let the relative angles between the mutually orthogonal vectors @xmath77 , @xmath115 ,",
    "@xmath116 and the mutually orthogonal vectors @xmath78 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 be @xmath165 @xmath166 this particular situation is represented in figure  5 . with this choice of angles ,",
    "the 9 relative angles satisfy ( [ k11 ] ) . therefore ,",
    "whatever the results of measuring @xmath75 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 on the first particle and @xmath76 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 on the second , we will always find the outcome @xmath50 in one direction of the first particle that forms , with one direction of the second particle in which the outcome @xmath50 has also been found , an angle @xmath79 satisfying ( [ k11 ] ) .",
    "for this case , the ladder argument , when @xmath163 , gives a contradiction .",
    "therefore , for @xmath4 of pairs no local realistic interpretation exists .",
    "the above proof is based on some specific properties of the singlet state of two spin-@xmath2 particles . in this section",

    "real experiments are not expected to elude the detection efficiency loophole @xcite , and therefore they will not provide more conclusive experimental tests against local realism than previous tests of bell s theorem @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the ladder proof proposed in this paper presents some advantages and disadvantages in relation to the ladder proof by hardy et al .",
    "pros : maximally entangled states are easier to produce in a laboratory since some of them are associated to a conserved quantity of a physical system after its decay into two parts . since my proof works for all the pairs , in principle , no postselection is needed .",
    "only a finite number of observables are needed .",
    "cons : i need at least a two - part three - level system .",
    "each step of the ladder would require more experiments than in the case of hardy et al .",
    "however , these experiments are always of the same kind .",
    "they consist on measuring the square of one spin component on one of the particles and the square of the same spin component or one orthogonal to it of the other particle . on the contrary , in the experiment by hardy et al .",
    "the relative orientation of the polarizers changes in every step of the proof .",
    "more cons : the geometrical argument requires measuring a triad of the square of spin components in three mutually orthogonal directions ( or the equivalent observables if a different physical system is considered ) .",
    "one way to do it is proposed in @xcite , however , it could be difficult to do this in practice .",
    "in this section i clarify the differences between ladder proofs of bell s theorem and proofs of the so - called kochen - specker with locality ( ksl ) theorem .",
    "the ksl theorem shows that , for two spin-@xmath2 particles in the singlet state , there is no hidden variables theory that satisfies separability , locality and some additional assumptions .",
    "this result was first proved by heywood and redhead in 1983 @xcite and then reelaborated many times since @xcite .",
    "its proof is based on two points : first , on kochen - specker ( ks ) geometric proofs @xcite , which show that noncontextual values explaining all quantum predictions are impossible for certain sets of observables of a single spin-@xmath2 particle ( usually these observables are squares of components of spin or other observables related to them , as in our ladder proof ) .",
    "second , on epr condition for elements of reality @xcite .",
    "but this condition is used here in a different way than in the ladder proofs : it is used to justify why in the singlet state of two spin-@xmath2 particles the previously mentioned observables must have a predefined value .",
    "in contrast , ladder proofs use epr condition to make predictions with certainty .",
    "indeed , no published proof of the ksl theorem can be used to construct a ladder proof of bell s theorem . to illustrate this point",
    "consider the following example .",
    "consider a singlet state of two spin-@xmath2 particles and on each of them , consider the simplest known ks geometric proof in a three dimensional hilbert space , due to conway and kochen @xcite .",
    "all the directions used in the following explanation belong to this geometric proof .",
    "suppose that we make a measurement on the first particle and found that @xmath174 ^ 2=0 $ ] .",
    "this implies that , for instance , @xmath175 ^ 2=\\hbar ^2 $ ] .",
    "then , this would imply that one of @xmath176 ^ 2 $ ] or @xmath177 ^ 2 $ ] must be @xmath50 ( and the other @xmath51 ) . but which one ? to decide it , one would need to know the value in a direction orthogonal both to @xmath178 and @xmath179 , or in a direction orthogonal to @xmath178 and @xmath180 , but such directions are not contained in the geometric proof by conway and kochen .",
    "therefore , using this geometric proof one can not decide which one must be @xmath50 .",
    "the same problem occurs sooner or later using every published geometric proof of the ks theorem and therefore occurs in every proof of the ksl theorem .",
    "in contrast , ladder proofs are based only on epr inferences .",
    "therefore , in a ladder proof one must be able to predict with certainty all the outcomes involved in the proof , except the two at the beginning ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the ladder proof by hardy et al . , or @xmath137 and @xmath146 in the proof proposed in this paper ) .",
    "hardy s argument @xcite is `` the best version of bell s theorem '' @xcite and possesses `` the highest attainable degree of simplicity and physical insight '' @xcite .",
    "the recent ladder extension @xcite is an improvement in the sense that a greater proportion of the pairs is subject to a contradiction with local realism .",
    "however , it does not work for maximally entangled states . in this paper ,",
    "i have presented a proof which fills the most important holes left by the ladder extension by hardy et al .",
    ": the new proof works for maximally entangled states of two spin-@xmath5 particles ( with @xmath6 ) , and the proportion of the pairs subject to a contradiction with local realism becomes @xmath4 .",
    "the experimental implementation of this proof could be achieved with present day technology , although in practice it would not provide more conclusive results than previous tests of bell s theorem .",
