    "although the shapes obtained via imaging results do not yield the complete shape of the inclusion with certainty , the iterative reconstruction algorithm can be successfully performed by employing them as an initial guess .",
    "however , the proposed algorithm has some limitations ; for example , it can not be applied to the limited - view inverse problems in contrast to the kirchhoff migration , refer to @xcite .",
    "therefore , the supplement of a deficiency point of the proposed algorithm will be an interesting subject .    in this contribution , we considered the imaging of thin electromagnetic inclusions when measured boundary data is polluted by gaussian random noise .",
