    "a detailed understanding of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon is important for revealing aspects of both perturbative and nonperturbative nucleon structure .",
    "the form factors also contain important information on nucleon radii and vector meson coupling constants .",
    "moreover , the form factors are an important ingredient in a wide range of experiments such as lamb shift measurements @xcite and measurements of the strangeness content of the nucleon @xcite . with the advent of the new continuous beam electron accelerators like cebaf ( jefferson lab . ) , mit - bates , and mami ( mainz ) , a wealth of precise data for spacelike momentum transfers has become available . due to the difficulty of the experiments , the timelike form factors are less well known . while there is a fair amount of information on the proton timelike form factors , only one measurement of the neutron form factor from the pioneering fenice experiment @xcite exists .",
    "the basic theoretical framework of dispersion theory for nucleon form factors was established long ago @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "these methods have been refined considerably .",
    "in particular , constraints from perturbative qcd and independent low - energy experiments ( e.g. on the neutron radius ) have been incorporated @xcite .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we review the status of dispersion theory for nucleon form factors and show results from a recent update @xcite . in the second part",

    "in the breit frame , @xmath14 and @xmath15 may be interpreted as the fourier transforms of the charge and magnetization distributions , respectively .",
    "based on unitarity and analyticity , dispersion relations relate the real and imaginary parts of the em nucleon form factors .",
    "let @xmath16 be a generic symbol for any one of the four nucleon form factors .",
    "we write down an unsubtracted dispersion relation of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the threshold of the lowest cut of @xmath19 .",

    "the four - momentum transfer in the timelike region is @xmath22 . using the lsz formalism ,",
    "the imaginary part of the form factors is obtained by inserting a complete set of intermediate states as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a nucleon spinor normalization factor , @xmath25 is the nucleon wave function renormalization , and @xmath26 with @xmath27 a nucleon source .",
    "the states @xmath28 are asymptotic states of momentum @xmath29 which are stable with respect to the strong interaction . for the matrix elements in eq .",

    "furthermore , they have no net baryon number . for the isoscalar part the lowest mass states are : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    "; for the isovector part they are : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 . because of @xmath38-parity , states with an odd number of pions only contribute to the isoscalar part , while states with an even number contribute to the isovector part .",
    "associated with each intermediate state is a cut starting at the corresponding threshold in @xmath39 and running to infinity . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectral function @xmath40 is different from zero along the cut from @xmath18 to @xmath41 with @xmath42 for the isovector ( isoscalar ) case .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eqj],[spectro ] ) , the spectral functions for the form factors can in principle be constructed from experimental data . in practice , this proves a formidable task and is also unstable .",
    "however , the spectral function can be constrained using , for example , vector meson dominance .      within the vector meson dominance ( vmd )",
    "approach , the spectral functions are approximated by a few vector meson poles , namely the @xmath43 in the isovector and the @xmath44 in the isoscalar channel , respectively . in that case",
    ", the form factors take the form @xmath45 clearly , such pole terms contribute to the spectral functions as @xmath46-functions , @xmath47 these terms arise naturally as approximations to vector meson resonances in the continuum of intermediate states like @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and so on .",
    "if the continuum contributions are strongly peaked near the vector meson resonances , eq .",
    "( [ emff : vmd ] ) is a good approximation .    for the contribution of the two - pion continuum to the isovector spectral functions , however , the replacement by a sharp @xmath52-resonance is not justified and strongly underestimates the isovector radius .",
    "the unitarity relation of frazer and fulco @xcite determines the isovector spectral functions from @xmath53 to @xmath54 gev@xmath55 in terms of the pion form factor @xmath56 and the p - wave @xmath57 partial wave amplitudes .",
    "the isovector spectral function is strongly enhanced close to the two - pion threshold ( see , e.g. , fig . 2 in ref .",
    "the reason for this behavior is well known .",
    "the corresponding partial waves have a branch point singularity on the second sheet ( from the projection of the nucleon pole terms ) located at @xmath58 very close to the physical threshold at @xmath59 .",
    "the isovector form factors inherit this singularity and the closeness to the physical threshold leads to the pronounced enhancement .",
    "note that in the vmd approach this spectral function is given by a @xmath46-function peak at @xmath60 and thus the isovector radii are strongly underestimated if one neglects the unitarity correction @xcite , as can be seen from the formula @xmath61 in the isoscalar channel , it is believed that the pertinent spectral functions rise smoothly from the three - pion threshold to the @xmath62-peak , i.e. that there is no pronounced effect from the three - pion cut on the left wing of the @xmath62-resonance ( which also has a much smaller width than the @xmath52 ) . in chiral perturbation theory an investigation of the spectral functions to two loops",
    "has indeed shown no such enhancement @xcite , in contrast to the one loop calculation of the isovector nucleon form factors where the unitarity correction on the left wing of the @xmath52 has been seen . a form factor analysis in the described framework with three vector meson poles in both the isoscalar and isovector channels as well as the two - pion continuum was carried out by hhler et al .",

    "due to the various constraints ( unitarity , normalizations , superconvergence relations ) , we end up with only three free parameters since two ( three ) of the isovector ( isoscalar ) masses can be identified with the masses of physical particles .",

    "neither data set can be described by the fit .",
    "even when the experimental uncertainties of the fenice data are reduced by a factor of 10 or more , the fit can not be forced through the data .",
    "it is possible that the spectral function simply has not enough freedom to account for the fenice data and additional poles have to be introduced .",
    "it is also surprising that the neutron form factor is larger in magnitude than the proton one , as pqcd predicts asymptotically equal magnitudes . in any case , there is interesting physics in the timelike neutron form factors and more data is called for .",

    "chpt allows for a systematic and model - independent calculation of low - energy observables by means of an expansion in small momenta and quark masses .",

    ", however , the relativistic method does not give an improvement over the heavy baryon expansion .",
