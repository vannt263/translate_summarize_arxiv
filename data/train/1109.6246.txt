    "in march of 2011 the large hadron collider ( lhc ) had begun , once again , colliding protons at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath3  tev . by june",
    "the atlas detector had recorded more than @xmath4  fb@xmath2 of proton - proton collisions . ] .",
    "these proceedings summarize the search for a @xmath0 boson decaying to a lepton ( where lepton is defined as a muon or electron ) plus a neutrino using @xmath1  fb@xmath2 of data collected by the atlas detector  @xcite .",
    "there are many extensions to the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics that predict a new high - mass state similar to the @xmath5 boson in the sm  @xcite . the sequential , standard model ( ssm ) boson , i.e. the extended gauge boson of ref .",
    "@xcite , is used to model a @xmath0 boson with the same couplings to leptons as the sm @xmath5 boson but at a higher mass .",
    "no @xmath0 boson signal is observed , and the data is used to set new limits  @xcite on @xmath6 ( cross section times branching fraction ) as a function of the @xmath0 boson mass .",
    "table  [ tab : xsec ] shows the signal production cross sections used for each mass point .",
    "the search is performed in the individual electron and muon channels where limits on @xmath7 and @xmath8 are set .",
    "the channels are also combined assuming the same branching fraction for both channels .",
    "the limits are determined by examining the transverse mass ( @xmath9 ) distribution for resonant states above @xmath10  gev , where @xmath9 is constructed from events with a single high transverse momentum ( @xmath11 ) lepton plus large missing transverse energy ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the angle between the lepton @xmath11 and @xmath12 vectors .- axis and the @xmath15 ",
    "@xmath16 plane is transverse to the beam direction .",
    "the positive @xmath15-axis is defined as pointing from the interaction point to the center of the lhc ring and the positive @xmath16-axis is defined as pointing upwards .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath17 is measured around the beam axis and the polar angle @xmath18 is the angle from the beam axis .",
    "the pseudorapidity is defined as @xmath19 .",
    "the distance @xmath20 in @xmath21 ",
    "@xmath17 space is defined as @xmath22 . ]",
    "a bayesian method is used to search for an excess of the @xmath9 signal above the expected backgrounds . when no excess is observed ( above @xmath23 ) a limit on the cross section ( @xmath24 significance ) times branching ratio ( @xmath25 ) is set where the ssm @xmath0 boson is used as a benchmark for setting limits .",
    "these proceedings begin with a brief description of the atlas detector in section [ sec : detector ] , followed by an explanation of the event selection in section [ sec : evtsel ] .",
    "the explanation of the modeling of the backgrounds is done in section [ sec : bknds ] .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents the final results and these proceedings are concluded in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the atlas detector is a general purpose particle detector that is characterized by three different components , the inner - detector ( i d ) , the calorimeter , and the muon system ( ms ) .",
    "the innermost system is the inner - detector which consists of a silicon pixel detector and a silicon strip detector covering @xmath26 .",
    "a transition radiation tracker is the outer tracker of the i d and covers @xmath27 .",
    "the i d is immersed in a homogenous @xmath28  t field produced from a superconducting solenoid .",
    "the i d allows reconstruction of the vertices and tracks of charged particles originating from the interaction region .",
    "a finely segmented , hermetic calorimeter system surrounds the i d and covers @xmath29 as well as provides three - dimensional reconstruction of particle showers . the electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter uses liquid argon , while the outer calorimeter , which primarily detects hadronic showers , uses scintillating tiles in the barrel ( @xmath30 ) and liquid argon for higher @xmath31 . the energy resolution for an electron approaches @xmath32 for electrons above @xmath33  gev in @xmath34 .",
    "the ms , situated outside the calorimeters , is immersed in a @xmath35  t toroidal field that is produced by superconducting air - core toroids .",
    "the integral magnetic field for the ms is about @xmath36  tm on average .",
    "the curvature of the muons as they pass through the magnetic field is measured with three layers of precision drift - tube chambers in the region @xmath27 and one layer of cathode - strip chambers followed by two layers of drift - tube chambers for @xmath37 .",
    "resistive - plate and thin - gap chambers provide the triggering for muons and measure the @xmath17 coordinate .",
    "the muon system is able to achieve a momentum resolution of @xmath38 at @xmath4  tev .",
    "the event selection for this analysis first requires that all events were recorded while the detector was operating in an optimal fashion . a well reconstructed primary vertex , with at least three reconstructed tracks associated with the vertex is required to be present in the event ( all objects selected in the event are then required to be associated with this primary vertex ) .",
    "the primary vertex is also required to be reconstructed within @xmath39  mm , along the @xmath40-axis , of the center of the interaction region .",
    "events are then examined to determine if any jets have abnormal shapes .",
    "if an event has a poorly reconstructed jet , then it is thrown out as this type of event could bias the @xmath12 measurement .",
    "only events that fire specific single - lepton triggers are included in the search .",
    "for the electron channel the lowest unprescaled lepton trigger for the dataset has a @xmath41  gev @xmath34 threshold .",
    "the trigger requires an em cluster in the em calorimeter that has an energy deposition profile consistent with that of an electron .",
    "the trigger also requires that the em cluster be matched to a track in the inner detector .",
    "the muon trigger has to be fired by the rpc or the tgc systems , and to pass a @xmath11 threshold of @xmath42  gev .",
    "then the trigger object has to match an inner detector track .    in the electron channel",
    ", the reconstructed electron energy must be larger than @xmath43  gev and the electron must have an @xmath44 or @xmath45 . the offline energy cluster must have an energy deposit that is consistent with that of an electron and is matched to an offline track . the offline track is required to have a transverse impact parameter within @xmath46  cm of the primary vertex and a longitudinal distance from the primary vertex within @xmath47  cm .",
    "a hit from the first layer of the pixel detector is required to be associated with the electron track .",
    "finally the energy isolation of the electron , @xmath48 is required to be less than @xmath49  gev .",
    "events with an additional electron are vetoed .",
    "the muon channel makes the following offline requirements .",
    "the offline muon track is first matched to the trigger object .",
    "a @xmath11 cut of @xmath43  gev is then required , where the @xmath11 is the combined transverse momentum in the ms and the i d .",
    "the @xmath31 of the muon must be less than @xmath47 or @xmath50 .",
    "the combined track of the muon is required to have a transverse impact parameter less than @xmath46  cm from the primary vertex and a longitudinal distance from the primary vertex less than @xmath47  cm .",
    "the muon track in the ms is required to register hits in all three stations of the ms , ensuring the best possible momentum measurement . as an additional quality cut , the significance of the difference of the curvature measurements between the i d and the ms is required to be less than @xmath51 .",
    "this requirement ensures that no poorly measured muons pass into the final sample . the track isolation , @xmath52 , is to be less than @xmath53 of the muon s @xmath11 .",
    "events with additional muons are also vetoed .",
    "finally both channels are required to have @xmath12 greater than @xmath43  gev . in order to further reduce",
    "the amount of background from light flavor or heavy flavor decays in the electron channel , the @xmath12 is required to be larger than @xmath54 of the electron @xmath34 .",
