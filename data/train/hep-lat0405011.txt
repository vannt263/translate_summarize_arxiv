    "in a previous paper  @xcite , which we denote by i in the following , we investigated the dynamics of 2d potts models in the glauber universality class .",
    "dynamics in this class , model  a in the classification of ref.@xcite , contains local monte carlo ( mc ) updating schemes @xcite which imitate the thermal fluctuations of nature .",
    "here we extend our study to the 3d 3-state potts model with and without an external magnetic field .",
    "this model gives an effective description of the deconfinement transition @xcite and by adding an external field @xcite , one can represent the effect of quark masses .    a detailed motivation of our study in the context of qcd and a compilation of preliminaries such as potts models , spinodal decomposition , fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) clusters and structure functions , are given in the first two sections of i and are not repeated here .",
    "hysteresis calculations for 2d potts models are presented in i for a number of observables including the ( internal ) energy , properties of fk clusters and structure function .",
    "the main result is that the dynamics leads for most parameter values to a spinodal decomposition , which dominates the statistical properties of the configurations , independently of whether the equilibrium transition is second or first order .",
    "hysteresis cycles and time evolution after a cooling @xcite quench are presented in i and we find also initial evidence ( compare fig .",
    "18 of i ) that the scenario of dynamical spinodal decomposition may survive when the equilibrium transition is rendered into a cross - over .",
    "the latter point is of importance for qcd , because lattice simulations and effective models suggest that for physical quark masses @xmath1 , @xmath2 of the order of 10 mev and @xmath3 of the order of 150 mev neither a chiral nor a deconfining transition occurs in the sense that there are thermodynamical singularities @xcite .    in the linear approximation of spinodal decomposition cahn - hilliard theory @xcite for model",
    "b predicts an exponential growth of the low momentum structure function in the initial part of the time evolution .",
    "whether such an exponential growth was found or not was used by miller and ogilvie @xcite to determine a critical @xmath4 between low and high momentum modes , which they related to the debye screening mass . in this paper",
    "we present the linear approximation , derive its diffusive differential equation , and confront the predicted exponential growth with mc data .    at the present level",
    "our results are mainly qualitative . within a model of dynamics",
    "one expects universal properties , because the equations of motion differ only in their constants , but not in their general structure .",
    "the proper dynamics for minkowskian relativistic dynamics is expected to be hyperbolic .",
    "altogether little is known about the kind of effects one may expect to be produced by a dynamics .",
    "therefore , we would like to advocate studies of different models of dynamics to get a handle on their similarities and differences .",
    "we begin with the diffusive dynamics of model  a by the pragmatic reason that it is relatively easy to follow the time evolution of corresponding mc algorithms .",
    "the study of hyperbolic dynamics within full qcd or just pure non - abelian gauge theory is presently out of reach .",
    "however the polyakov loop model of pisarski and dumitru @xcite allows for simulations in the minkowskian @xcite and it may be interesting to confront an investigation of its dynamics with our present results .    in the next section we fill a gap of the literature by presenting the linear theory of spinodal decomposition for model  a. our numerical results are compiled in section  [ sec_nr ] , with quench and hysteresis investigations in subsections . summary and conclusions are given in the final section  [ sec_conclude ] .",
    "metastable states are non - equilibrium states with lifetimes comparable to the time of observation , while unstable states are non - equilibrium evolving states with no observable lifetime @xcite . when dealing with metastable states we consider systems with a first order phase transition , while unstable states can be observed for systems with first and second order phase transitions .",
    "metastable and unstable states are distinguished by different types of instability characterizing the early stages of a phase separation .",
    "metastable states require finite amplitude , localized fluctuations .",
    "the system evolves by growing the nuclei or droplets of the new phase and the theory of nucleation explains ( e.g. becker - dring theory @xcite ) the rate of formation of such nucleating droplets .",
    "in contrast , infinitesimal amplitude , non - localized fluctuations are sufficient for the initial decay of unstable states , which is called spinodal decomposition .    in mean field theory",
    "there is a sharp distinction between metastable and unstable states .",
    "they are separated by the spinodal curve , which is the locus of points inside the coexistence curve for which an appropriate susceptibility ( for instance the concentration susceptibility @xmath5 for binary fluids ) diverges .",
    "there is no sharp distinction in real systems .",
    "there is a difference in the dynamics for models with conserved ( model  b in the classification of @xcite ) and non - conserved ( model  a ) order parameters .",
    "binary alloy or binary fluid models are typical examples of models with conserved order parameters ( the concentration @xmath6 ) .",
    "originally @xcite the linear approximation was developed for model  b. following @xcite we consider here a linear theory of spinodal decomposition for model  a. related results can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the general picture is the same for model  a and model  b dynamics .",
    "the difference is in the quantitative details .",
    "we start by considering the coarse - grained free energy @xcite .",
    "it is a functional of the order parameter and its minima correspond to the equilibrium states of the model . to use the coarse - grained energy for a study of non - equilibrium phenomena",
    ", one assumes that the model is not too far from equilibrium .",
    "the requirement is fulfilled for systems with slow dynamics on the scale of local equilibration times .",
    "one introduces a spatial mesoscopic length scale @xmath7 , separating the fast dynamics local microscopic regions from the slow dynamics macroscopic regions .",
    "the system is divided into regions ( _ elementary physical cells _ ) of size @xmath7 , which are centered around vector coordinates @xmath8 defining their positions .",
    "the length scale @xmath7 has to be significantly larger than the lattice spacing size , @xmath9 , to allow for a statistical treatment of the elementary physical cells .",
    "the other requirement is that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a typical correlation length of the system . on the scale @xmath7 one",
    "treats the system as being in the equilibrium .",
    "the order parameter @xmath12 ( e.g. the magnetization ) has to vary smoothly on the length scales larger than @xmath7 , to satisfy the requirement that the system on these length scales is not far from equilibrium .",
    "since elementary physical cells are equilibrated , their equilibrium thermodynamical functions are defined .",
    "we write down the coarse - grained partition function for the system of cells @xmath13 where the sum is over spin configurations @xmath14 and the prime indicates the constraint @xmath15 by summing in eq .",
    "( [ coarse_gr_z ] ) over all configurations @xmath16 of magnetization , one gets the normal partition function .",
    "the phenomenological model we use is based on the assumption that the rate of displacement of the order parameter is linearly proportional to the local thermodynamic force @xmath26 @xmath27 the coefficient of the proportionality , @xmath28 , is the response coefficient and defines the relaxation time scale of the system .",
    "this equation describes a purely dissipative system and not one with an internal hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the structure factor ( or function ) can be measured in condensed matter experiments : a system is exposed to radiation of a wavelength @xmath46 and the scattering intensity at different angles @xmath47 is recorded .",
    "the structure factor @xmath48 is proportional to the scattering intensity at the angle @xmath47 , where @xmath49 . in the gauge theory studies",
    "one may expect that the structure factor reflects the production of corresponding momentum gluons .",
    "the structure function can be written as @xmath50 to derive the equation of motion for the structure factor we take the time derivative of @xmath48 and make use of eq .  ( [ u_eq_mot ] ) @xmath51 the average of fluctuations about the average magnetization has to be zero @xmath52 .",
    "thus ( [ s_eq_mot1 ] ) becomes @xmath53 with the solution @xmath54 we see that it is very similar to the evolution of fluctuations .",
    "again , if @xmath55 low momentum modes grow exponentially .",
    "the value of the critical momentum is the same as for the fluctuations .",
    "the maximum growing mode is the one for which @xmath56 takes on its maximum , @xmath57 . in the linear theory @xmath58 according to eq .",
    "( [ omega_k ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath59 decrease with increasing @xmath60 .",
    "then there exists a @xmath4 value , so that higher momentum modes @xmath61 are exponentially decaying .",
    "the results in the linear approximation are the same as for models with conserved order parameter , except for the values of @xmath56 and @xmath62",
    ".    a similar structure factor behavior may be obtained from the somewhat more accurate langevin approach if we consider only linear terms .",
    "this result was first obtained for model  b by h. cook according to the review  @xcite . for model",
    "a a straightforward algebra yields @xmath63 when the intrinsic dynamics of the system is prevailing over the extrinsic thermal fluctuations than the right hand side is dominated by the first term and the previous result for the structure function ( [ str_fact ] ) is recovered .      in the following",
    "we assume the existence of two phases , each described by a single equilibrium value of an order parameter .",
    "potts models belong to a slightly more general group , because there are @xmath64 equilibrium values in the ordered phase .",
    "to trace them in our present discussion would lead to a rather cumbersome notation .",
    "now the uniform free energy @xmath20 at the scale @xmath7 has two minima which correspond to the equilibrium values of the order parameter in the two phases : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the obvious criterium for the validity of the linear approximation is that the mean square value of fluctuations of the magnetization are much smaller than the square of the magnetization scale , @xmath67 : @xmath68 .",
    "note that the fluctuations @xmath69 depend on the introduced coarse - grained scale .",
    "the fluctuations are averaged over the cells of volume @xmath70 @xmath71 and we can write the condition for the validity of the linear approximation as @xmath72 the langevin approach allows us to estimate the value of @xmath73 from the requirement that the first term of the right - hand side of ( [ langevin_sf ] ) is the largest ( see @xcite for similar consideration for model  b ) and gives @xmath74 if we assume that the system is near the critical point @xmath75 , this equation is _ not _ fulfilled . close to @xmath75",
    "the only relevant length scale is the correlation length @xmath76 .",
    "the analysis of planar interfaces @xcite shows that @xmath77 is essentially a surface tension @xmath78 in a scaling sense .",
    "so we can rewrite ( [ linear1 ] ) as @xmath79 but critical point scaling arguments show that the ratio @xmath80 is a universal constant of order unity for @xmath81 .",
    "this means that for near - critical quenches the linear approximation is not valid and non - linear behavior is relevant .    for quenches",
    "far from the transition point @xmath82 the mean - field approach becomes accurate .",
    "it allows to evaluate the condition ( [ linear1 ] ) of validity of the linear approximation .",
    "using mean - field estimates one finds inequality ( [ linear1 ] ) to hold for both model  a and b @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the lattice spacing and @xmath85 is the range of the interaction . for potts models",

    "as in i we measured various properties of fk and geometrical clusters .",
    "see the definitions given in  i.    for most of our simulations we use the heat bath algorithm with systematic updating , because we found previously that systematic updating is faster than random updating .",
    "however , for the linear theory of spinodal decomposition , one may be interested in the very early time development .",
    "then it is advantageous to be able to take data within one sweep and we use random updating for a few cases .",
    "we study the time evolution after a quench from an initial to a final temperature @xmath148 and are interested in the limit of large lattices , @xmath149 . to get a statistically meaningful sample , we performed between @xmath150 and @xmath151 repetitions of each quench . here the first number counts the pcs we used in parallel and the second number gives the repetitions performed on each pc .",
    "the large number of repetitions required and the various adjustable parameters ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) make a thorough investigation laborious and quite computer time consuming .",
    "therefore , we were not able to arrive at conclusion for all questions , which deemed interesting to us .",
    "miller and ogilvie  @xcite investigated the dynamics of su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge theories after quenching from a low to a high physical temperature ( corresponding to the @xmath155 in the spin system ) .",
    "they report a critical value @xmath4 , so that modes grow ( do not grow ) exponentially for @xmath156 ( @xmath61 ) . using an effective potential approach , they were able to relate @xmath4 to the debye screening mass .",

    "figure  [ fig_hsfk_a ] shows the thus obtained very early time development of the structure functions of @xmath100 for @xmath164 and  4 .",

    "the time between the updating schemes is scaled according to @xmath168 .",
    "the fit values for @xmath169 are positive for the low values of @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "notably , the largest value @xmath172 is obtained for @xmath162 in contrast to the monotonous decrease of @xmath173 which the linear theory ( [ omega_k ] ) predicts for increasing @xmath170 . already our 2d results of fig .",
    "[ fig_hsfk_a ] disagreed with the ordering of @xmath173 predicted by the linear theory , but there it comes to no surprise , as the linear theory fails altogether in 2d . in 3d",

    "so the finite size correction from @xmath182 to @xmath184 is about 3% . for @xmath185 and 110 we estimate @xmath186 , outside the range where we took data .",
    "the @xmath4 estimate of @xcite ( the polyakov loops substituting for the potts spins ) does not consider fnite size corrections , which future studies may reveal .      a quench in the temperature changes instantaneously the bond probability of fk cluster configurations and observables such as the number of clusters , the mean volume and surface , the maximum volume , and maximum surface change considerably .",
    "then the evolution proceeds smoothly .",
    "the fk potts clusters are similar to domains in a ferromagnet . for each of the possible magnetizations we define the largest cluster .",
    "when we quench into the ordered phase one magnetization will eventually take over .",
    "however , a - priori the system does not know which direction this is , because it is prepared in the disordered state where all directions are equally probable .",
    "let us address the question how the system grows domains .",
    "there are two alternatives .",
    "( i )  the system grows a cluster of a particular magnetization , while clusters of the other magnetizations decay right from the beginning .",
    "( ii ) the system grows clusters in each direction of magnetization . at a later stage",
    "smaller clusters coalesce by statistical fluctuations and one of the directions emerges as dominant .    in fig .",
    "[ quench:3qdom ] we plot the evolution of the largest fk clusters for the three magnetizations of the 3-state potts model in zero external magnetic field . for different",
    "lattice sizes the plot shows that the system grows clusters of each magnetization before one becomes dominant .",
    "the process of competitions between the largest clusters of different magnetization takes longer on the larger lattices .    to study the dependence of the speed of the evolution on the depth of the quench",
    ", we consider different final temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ quench:3q_diff ] we compile results for a @xmath187 lattice and find that the growth of the largest clusters of all the magnetizations is faster when the system is quenched deeper into the ordered phase .    for gauge theories an equivalent percolation model does not exist and it is problematic to find an appropriate substitute for the fk definition when clusters of polyakov loops are considered .",
    "but it is easy to study geometrical clusters .",
    "therefore , we compare for the 3d 3-state potts model the evolution of geometrical and fk clusters in fig .",
    "[ quench:3q_geom ] .",
    "the geometrical definition ( bonds between neighboring spins of the same direction are always set ) leads to the first of our two scenarios .",
    "geometrical clusters do not compete .",
    "the system starts growing one of the domains , while reducing the largest domains of the other magnetizations right after the quench .",
    "this picture is unfavorable for the use of geometrical clusters of polyakov loops in gauge theories .",
    "fk clusters are subsets of geometrical clusters .",
    "so , the fk clusters of the figure are always smaller than the geometrical .",
    "sufficiently far in the ordered phase fk and geometrical domains converge in size , while closer to the disordered phase the difference is significant , because geometrical clusters lead to artificial groupings of spins into clusters .",
    "next , we apply the external magnetic field @xmath188 , which puts the model slightly above the critical endpoint at @xmath189 in the @xmath190 plane , see eq .",
    "( [ 3dpotts_cp ] ) , and drive the system through the emerging region of a sharp crossover .",
    "the external magnetic field sets the direction of preferable magnetization . in fig .",
    "[ quench:3qh ] we see that the growth proceeds in the same manner as for @xmath191 with fk clusters of all magnetizations growing at the early time , only that the preferred domain grows a bit faster than before .",

    "the @xmath244 structure functions are bounded from above by @xmath245 , implying @xmath246 for any true asymptotic behavior .",
    "apparently lattices of size @xmath247 are needed . with checkerboard updating",
    "they could be handled on supercomputers .    for a @xmath187 lattice we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_hys_sf1kv3dh ] the structure function @xmath229 for the 3d 3-state potts model in the @xmath188 field for different @xmath248 up to @xmath249 together with equilibrium data .",
    "the approach to equilibrium with the decrease of the speed of the dynamics ( increase of @xmath199 ) appears to be faster than in 2d .",
    "possibly a greater connectedness of domains allows in higher dimensional models for a faster evolution of macroscopic structures . the heating ( @xmath250 ) peak develops and reaches the equilibrium peak , as we reduce the speed .",
    "the cooling peak decreases , but it would need much slower simulations to reach the equilibrium values .",
    "thus within a range of speeds the cooling peak stays strong and spinodal decomposition is the dominant scenario . for @xmath191",
    "the figure looks very similar , but for an increase of all peak values by a factor of about two .",
    "the explanation of the difference between the heating and cooling branches presented for 2d models in  i remains valid .",
    "driven from the disordered to the ordered phase , the system freezes in domains of different magnetization , which are slow to evolve . for",
    "a fast dynamics it does not have enough time to equilibrate in the ordered phase .",
    "the decrease of the speed allows then the system to equilibrate in the ordered phase and the heating peak emerges .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_hys_hsfk3d ] and  [ fig_hys_hsfk3dh ] we plot for an @xmath184 lattice the lowest momentum ( @xmath251 ) structure functions for zero and non - zero external magnetic field . in the absence of the external magnetic field",
    "we observe that the peaks are very pronounced for @xmath160 to @xmath162 , and much smaller for @xmath252 . in the presence of the external magnetic field",
    "all peaks are smaller and the difference between lower and higher modes is less distinct . we still observe a qualitative difference between the @xmath253 and the @xmath252 modes .",
    "another observation is that the peaks are less broad for @xmath188 than for @xmath191 , because the system equilibrates for @xmath254 easier in the ordered phase .      in  i",
    "we identified the maximum connected surface of fk clusters as an interesting quantity . in the transition region",
    "it exhibits a pronounced peak related to percolation .",
    "the 3d analysis @xcite of this quantity has remained limited to rather small lattices ( @xmath255 ) , because of a rapid slowing down with lattice size of the algorithm identifying the maximum connected surface .",
    "in contrast to 2d deviations from equilibrium appear relatively weak .",
    "a reason may be that the extra dimension adds new degrees of freedom to the surface .",
    "for the crossover region ( @xmath188 ) the approach to equilibrium is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hys_clsmvh ] by comparing the dynamics at different speeds ( including a ` super - fast ' @xmath256 choice ) with equilibrated data .",
    "notably the figure is practically identical for the @xmath191 transition , reiterating that percolation happens for a crossover in quite the same way as for a proper transition  @xcite .",
    "in our simulations of the model  a dynamics of the 3d 3-state potts model on @xmath175 lattices , we find spinodal decomposition to be the dominant scenario of phase conversion . under a quench from the disordered into the ordered phase , we observe an early time development of structure functions @xmath257 , which is in over - all agreement with the exponential growth predicted by the linear theory of spinodal decomposition for @xmath156 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_omega_3dsq ] ) . however , the ordering of the growth coefficients is not always in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ omega_k ] ) .",
    "further , the linear approximation fails for near critical quenches ( as was known before  @xcite ) and , altogether , in 2d .",
    "following the structure function evolution over extended times , their pronounced peaks are the most noticeable feature .",
    "it is certainly a challenge to base a theory of spinodal decomposition on their finite size scaling instead of using the linear approximation .",
    "unfortunately , very large lattices appear to be needed to extrapolate the infinite volume limit for the structure function maxima . within our hysteresis investigation we pushed their analysis to systems as large as @xmath0 .",
    "but , for zero external magnetic field we find an increase , which can not yet be asymptotic , because it violates an upper bound . applying a small external magnetic field ( @xmath188 ) and quenching through the cross - over region results in an increase with @xmath154 for small lattices ( @xmath258 ) and a _ slower than non - critical",
    "_ fall off on our larger ( @xmath259 ) lattices ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sfmax ] ) .",
    "if the last trend continues towards @xmath149 , signals of spinodal decomposition would survive the continuum limit of an analogue qcd scenario .",
    "a quench into the ordered phase leads to a competition of fk cluster domains .",
    "for the proper transition ( @xmath191 ) this leads to a divergence of the equilibration time in the limit @xmath149 , an effect well - known in condensed matter physics  @xcite . for a cross - over the @xmath149 scenario is less scary , but our fig .",

    "[ quench:3q_diff ] the largest one covers only about 10% the system .",
    "so , a number of vacuum domains are expected and the effects from the dynamics are manifested on their surfaces . inside the domains",
