    "we consider nearest - neighbor random walks on the one - dimensional integer lattice in an i.i.d .  cookie environment with a uniformly bounded number of cookies per site .",
    "the uniform bound on the number of cookies per site will be denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "informally speaking , a cookie environment is constructed by placing a pile of cookies at each site of the lattice ( see figure  [ informal ] ) .",
    "the piles of cookies represent the transition probabilities of the random walker : upon each visit to a site the walker consumes the topmost cookie from the pile at that site and makes a unit step to the right or to the left with probabilities prescribed by that cookie . if the cookie pile at the current site is empty the walker makes a unit step to the right or to the left with equal probabilities",
    ".    a cookie will be called positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) if its consumption makes the walker to go to the right with probability larger ( resp.smaller ) than 1/2 .",
    "a cookie which is neither positive nor negative will be called a placebo .",
    "placebo cookies allow us to assume without loss of generality that each pile originally consists of exactly @xmath3 cookies . unless stated otherwise , the random walker always starts at the origin .",
    "the term  excited random walk \" was introduced by benjamini and wilson in @xcite , where they considered random walks on @xmath4 , @xmath5 , in an environment of identical cookies , one per each site . allowing more ( or fewer ) than one cookie per site and randomizing",
    "the environment naturally gave rise to the multi - excited random walk model in random cookie environments .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for the precise description and first results .",
    "it was clear then that this new model exhibits a very interesting behavior for @xmath6 .",
    "we shall mention some of the results for @xmath7 in section  [ mult ] and now concentrate on the one - dimensional case .",
    "the studies of excited random walks on integers were continued in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite deals with numerical simulations of this model . in all papers mentioned above a ( possible ) bias introduced by the consumption of a cookie was assumed to be only in one direction , say , positive . the recurrence and transience , strong law of large numbers @xcite , conditions for positive linear speed @xcite , @xcite , and the rates of escape to infinity for transient walks with zero speed @xcite are now well understood . yet",
    "some of the methods and facts used in the proofs ( for example , comparison with simple symmetric random walks , submartingale property ) depend significantly on this `` positive bias '' assumption .",
    "the main novelty of the current paper is in considering cookie environments , which may induce positive or negative drifts at different sites or even at the same site on successive visits .",
    "our main results are the recurrence / transience criterion ( theorem 1 ) , the criterion for positive linear speed ( theorem 2 ) and an annealed central limit theorem ( theorem 3 ) .",
    "the first two theorems are extensions of those for non - negative cookie environments but we believe that this is a purely one - dimensional phenomenon . moreover , in section  [ mult ] we give an example , which shows that , at least for @xmath8 , the criteria for recurrence or transience and for positive linear speed can not depend just on a single parameter , the average total drift per site ( see ( [ d ] ) ) .",
    "the order of the cookies in the pile should matter as well .",
    "the proofs are based on the connections to branching processes with migration . branching processes allowing both immigration and emigration",
    "were studied by several authors in the late 70-ties through about the middle of the 90-ties , and we use some of the results from the literature ( section  [ lit ] ) . see the review paper @xcite for more results and an extensive list of references up to about 1990 .",
    "the connection between one - dimensional random walks and branching processes was observed long time ago .",
    "in particular , it was used for the study of random walks in random environments , see e.g.@xcite . in the context of excited random walks ,",
    "this idea was employed recently in @xcite , @xcite ( still under the `` positive bias '' assumption ) . in the present paper",
    "we are using results from the literature about branching processes with migration in a more essential way than @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of our tasks is to show how to translate statements about excited random walks into statements for a class of branching processes with migration which have been studied in the past .",
