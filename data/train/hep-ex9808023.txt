    "the lep accelerator has provided collisions at ever increasing energies over the past two years . in this paper",
    "we present measurements of cross - sections for hadronic ,  and lepton pair final states at a centre - of - mass energy @xmath0 of 183  gev ; forward - backward asymmetries for the leptonic states are also given .",
    "the data were collected by the opal detector at lep in 1997 . during 1997",
    "lep briefly returned to centre - of - mass energies of 130 and 136  gev , providing an integrated luminosity at these energies similar to the 1995 ` lep1.5 ' run .",
    "we also present cross - sections and asymmetry measurements from these data , and combine them with the results from the earlier run  @xcite .",
    "the analyses presented here are essentially the same as those already presented at lower energies  @xcite .",
    "we use identical techniques to measure @xmath47 , the square of the centre - of - mass energy of the  system after initial - state radiation , and to separate ` non - radiative ' events , which have little initial - state radiation , from ` radiative return ' to the z peak .",
    "however , we have changed the definition of non - radiative events compared with  @xcite , loosening the requirement from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "this new definition reduces the total measurement errors at the highest centre - of - mass energies , and is the recommended definition of the lep electroweak working group .",
    "inclusive measurements are corrected to @xmath50 as before . as in our previous publication ,",
    "we correct our measurements of hadronic ,  and events for the effect of interference between initial- and final - state radiation .",
    "we use the same treatment as before of the four - fermion contribution to the two - fermion final states . because of ambiguities arising from the @xmath51-channel contribution , for the  final state the acceptance is defined in terms of the angle @xmath52 of the electron or positron with respect to the electron beam direction and the acollinearity angle @xmath53 between the electron and positron .",
    "cross - sections and asymmetries for  are not corrected for interference between initial- and final - state radiation ; they are compared to theoretical predictions which include interference .",
    "measurements of fermion - pair production up to 172  gev have shown very good agreement with standard model expectations  @xcite . here",
    "we repeat our measurement of the electromagnetic coupling constant ( @xmath0 ) including the higher energy data . including data at 183",
    "gev also allows us to extend the searches for new physics presented in  @xcite .",
    "in particular we obtain improved limits on the energy scale of a possible four - fermion contact interaction .",
    "we also present improved limits on the coupling of a heavy particle such as a leptoquark , or a scalar quark ( squark ) in supersymmetric theories with @xmath1-parity violation , which might affect the hadronic cross - section via a @xmath51-channel exchange diagram .",
    "these analyses are updates of those already presented in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend our search for heavy particles to include those coupling to leptons only .",
    "such particles could be scalar neutrinos ( sneutrinos ) in supersymmetric theories with @xmath1-parity violation .",
    "searches for such particles have been presented in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we introduce a new technique in which a scan over the complete @xmath47 distribution improves our sensitivity for masses between the centre - of - mass energy points of lep for processes involving @xmath54-channel sneutrinos .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the data analysis , cross - section and asymmetry measurements . as the analyses are essentially the same as in  @xcite we give only a brief description of any changes .",
    "in section  [ sec : sm ] we compare our measurements to the predictions of the standard model and use them to measure the energy dependence of @xmath55 .",
    "the results of searches for new physics are presented in section  [ sec : new_phys ] .",
    "the opal detector axis is along the electron beam direction and the @xmath56 axis is horizontal .",
    "the polar angle @xmath52 is measured with respect to the @xmath57 axis and the azimuthal angle @xmath58 with respect to the @xmath56 axis . ] , trigger and data acquisition system are fully described elsewhere  @xcite . the analyses presented in this paper use 5457  pb@xmath59 of data collected at centre - of - mass energies of 181184  gev during 1997 ; the actual amount of data varies from channel to channel .",
    "the luminosity - weighted mean centre - of - mass energy is 182.69@xmath600.06  gev  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we present results for about 2.6 ( 3.3 )  pb@xmath59 of data at 130.00@xmath600.03 ( 135.98@xmath600.03 )  gev collected during 1997 and combine these with earlier results at similar centre - of - mass energies  @xcite .",
    "selection efficiencies and backgrounds were calculated using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the set of generators used is identical to that in  @xcite . at 183",
    "gev a new background arises from the production of z - pair events ; these were simulated with the grc4f  @xcite and pythia  @xcite generators .",
    "all events were passed through a simulation  @xcite of the opal detector and processed as for real data .",
    "the luminosity was measured using small - angle bhabha scattering events recorded in the silicon - tungsten luminometer  @xcite .",
    "the overall error on the luminosity measurement amounts to 0.43% at 183  gev , arising mainly from data statistics ( 0.26% ) and knowledge of the theoretical cross - section ( 0.25% ) . at 130 ( 136 )",
    "gev the total error of 1.0% ( 1.0% ) arises mainly from data statistics .",
    "errors from the luminosity measurement are included in all the systematic errors on cross - sections quoted in this paper , and correlations between measurements arising from the luminosity determination are included in all fits .",
    "hadronic , ,  and  events were selected using the criteria described in  @xcite with some modifications to improve efficiency and background at the higher centre - of - mass energy . here",
    "we briefly describe these changes .    * in the selection of  events we have rejected events identified as w - pairs according to the criteria of  @xcite , instead of subtracting their expected contribution , resulting in a reduction of about 15% in the overall error on the non - radiative cross - section . *",
    "the background in the muon pair sample has been reduced from 11.5% to 4.7% for inclusive events , from 6.7% to 2.0% for non - radiative events , by introducing a cut on the invariant mass of the muon pair . for inclusive events ,",
    "if the ratio of the visible energy to the centre - of - mass energy is less than @xmath62 the muon pair invariant mass is required to be greater than 70  gev . for non - radiative events",
    "the mass is required to be greater than @xmath63 ( about 108  gev ) . * the efficiency for tau pairs , particularly radiative events ,",
    "has been increased by extending the angular acceptance and adjusting cuts so that additional background is suppressed .",
    "the result of the changes is to increase the efficiency for inclusive events from 31% to 40% , with a modest ( 2% ) increase in background . in detail",
    "the changes are : * * the acceptance has been increased by requiring that the value of @xmath64 for both tau leptons satisfies @xmath65 , instead of demanding that the average value satisfy @xmath66 . * * the cuts on the total energy of an event have been modified : as before , the total visible energy in the event , derived from the scalar sum of all track momenta plus electromagnetic calorimeter energy , was required to be less than 1.1@xmath67 , but the lower cut on this variable was removed . instead",
    ", the total electromagnetic calorimeter energy was required to be greater than 0.02@xmath67 and either the total electromagnetic calorimeter energy or the scalar sum of track momenta was required to be greater than 0.2@xmath67 . * * the cuts on the missing momentum and its direction , calculated using electromagnetic calorimeter clusters , have been modified : the missing momentum in the plane transverse to the beam axis was required to exceed 0.015@xmath67 , and the polar angle of the missing momentum was required to satisfy @xmath68 .",
    "the cut on the polar angle of the missing momentum calculated using central detector tracks was removed . * * the above modifications increase the efficiency substantially , but also increase the background , particularly from bhabha events . to reduce this background two new cuts",
    "have been introduced . using the values of @xmath52 measured for the two tau leptons ( as defined in  @xcite ) ,",
    "the expected energy of each lepton is calculated assuming that the final state consists only of two leptons plus a single unobserved photon along the beam direction .",
    "we then require that @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the total electromagnetic calorimeter energies in each tau cone normalized to the expected value calculated above , and @xmath72 are the scalar sums of track momenta in the two tau cones , also normalized to the expected values .",
    "these cuts are designed to remove both electron and muon pairs .    in  @xcite non - radiative events",
    "were selected by demanding @xmath48 ; here we select non - radiative samples by demanding @xmath49 .",
    "distributions of @xmath73 for each channel , determined using kinematic fits for hadrons and track angles for the lepton pairs as in  @xcite , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp ] . efficiencies , backgrounds and feedthrough of events from lower @xmath47 into the non - radiative samples were calculated from monte carlo simulation , and are given in table  [ tab : eff ] .",
