    "electric and spin transport near ferromagnet - paramagnet interfaces received a large attention boost with the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance effect @xcite and the subsequent developments in magnetoelectronics and spintronics .",
    "aronov @xcite , and later johnson and silsbee @xcite theoretically predicted that an electric current through such an interface leads to an accumulation of nonequilibrium spin polarization with an accompanying spin current in the paramagnetic metal .",
    "a reverse effect also takes place , a pure spin current from the normal metal gives rise to an electric potential difference in the ferromagnet .",
    "the physics of these phenomena is quite simple .",
    "a sufficiently large difference of conductivities of spin - up and spin - down electrons in ferromagnets induces spin polarization of the electric current therein .",
    "spin polarized currents passing through ferromagnet - paramagnet boundaries result in an accumulation of nonequilibrium magnetization near the interface . both the spin injection and detection of this spin polarization has been experimentally demonstrated in refs . in systems containing two or more junctions of thin normal metal wires with ferromagnets .",
    "one of them acts as a spin injector , while the other is a detector , where the voltage created by diffusing spins can be measured .",
    "related spin - polarized transport phenomena have been investigated in many spintronic applications , such as giant magnetoresistance @xcite , spin hall effects @xcite , current induced magnetization dynamics @xcite , spin - pumping @xcite , and spin caloritronics @xcite .    in the case of superconducting systems , spin injection and detection within a nonlocal setup similar to the one studied in ref .",
    "was investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "these studies have been focused on dc transport .",
    "they revealed a strong renormalization of spin - related transport parameters as compared to normal systems .",
    "these changes were mostly caused by the modified density of states in a superconductor . beyond such quasi - particle transport properties ,",
    "the macroscopic coherent state of the superconducting condensate can give rise to a quite different transport phenomenon associated with the spin - polarized transport .",
    ".,width=302 ]    below we will consider an ac effect produced by a dc spin current towards a thin ferromagnetic contact .",
    "the dc potential induced by this polarization flux gives rise to an ac electric current of condensate electrons .",
    "since in the considered experimental setup the total current of the superconducting and normal components must be zero , the ac condensate oscillations result in an ac potential difference between the opposite sides of the contact . a schematic of a possible experimental setup",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "a current is passed from a ferromagnet to a normal metal generating an associated spin accumulation and spin current therein . in the non - local geometry",
    ", this spin accumulation also diffuses transversely in a contacted normal metal towards another normal metal reservoir via a ferromagnet contact .",
    "the non - local potential @xmath0 increases with the injected dc current @xmath1 and the nonlocal resistance @xmath2 describes the spin transport properties in the device .",
    "we will demonstrate that when the normal metals become superconducting , @xmath3 acquires an ac component in addition to the dc component in the normal state .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "a model system used in our calculation is described in sec .",
    "also in this section we present a simple calculation of the ac voltage oscillations assuming a local thermodynamic equilibrium between quasiparticles and the condensate . a microscopic analysis based on coupled kinetic equations for the superconducting order parameter and the quasiparticle distribution function",
    "will be given in sec .",
    "a discussion of results will be presented in sec .",
    "our model system consists of two superconducting wires in contact via a spin - active barrier .",
    "we consider this contact to be weak in the form of a thin ferromagnetic layer with , if necessary , additional insulating layers .",
    "such a barrier can be characterized by two resistances @xmath4 and @xmath5 corresponding to two spin eigenstates .",
    "we assume that a non - equilibrium spin polarization is created in the left wire ( see fig.1 ) , either by spin injection , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , or by other means .",
    "moreover , we assume that the electron s energy relaxation is faster than their spin relaxation , so that up and down spin distributions can be characterized by the respective chemical potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 , resulting in the spin accumulation potential @xmath8 . in the right ( @xmath9 )",
    "wire @xmath10 is much smaller , if the spin relaxation is faster than the influx of polarization from the left reservoir through the ferromagnetic contact .",
    "this is satisfied when the contact resistance is much larger than the resistance of the wire of the length @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the diffusion constant and @xmath13 is the spin relaxation rate .",
    "this is true in many practical cases , in particular , in the systems studied in ref . .",
    "we , therefore , simplify our model assuming @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the equilibrium chemical potential and @xmath0 is the charge potential difference between two wires .    with these definitions",
    "the electric current through the contact in the normal state is @xmath17where the inverse charge and spin resistances are given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . in an open circuit , electro - neutrality requires @xmath20 , and eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) gives @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the spin current polarization of the contact .",
    "this is just the voltage induced by the spin current trough the contact , as it has been experimentally demonstrated in ref . .",
    "let us now consider this situation for superconducting wires .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 , so that the nonequilibrium spin polarization does not cause depairing @xcite .",
    "the difference between cooper pair energies on opposite sides of the contact is @xmath24 .",
    "this potential difference gives rise to the ac josephson current @xmath25 of condensed electrons .",
    "in addition , electro - neutrality causes an oppositely directed current @xmath26 of quasi - particles , so that the total electric current is zero .",
    "this results in dc and ac voltage differences between the left and right superconductors that we will now compute .    the simplest approach to this problem is based on the assumption that in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath27 the quasiparticle current remains expressed by eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) .",
    "we will discuss in the next section in which regime this approach is valid . denoting the phase difference of the order parameters between the left and right wires as @xmath28 , and taking into account that @xmath29 , electro - neutrality @xmath30 and eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) dictates @xmath31where @xmath32 is the critical josephson current .",
    "it is easy to see that when @xmath33 the josephson current is dominated by harmonic oscillations with the frequency @xmath34 .",
    "hence , the voltage induced by the spin current is @xmath35the dc component @xmath36 of this voltage is exactly the same as in the case of normal metals .",
    "additionally , @xmath37 contains a term that oscillates with a frequency determined by the dc ( normal state ) contribution of the non - local signal .",
    "the magnitude of the oscillating voltage can be estimated by noting that at temperatures close to @xmath38 @xmath39where @xmath40 is the superconducting gap and @xmath41 is a dimensionless coefficient that takes into account the depairing effect inside the ferromagnetic contact layer @xcite , leading to exponential suppression of the josephson current and , consequently to small values of @xmath42 .",
    "it should be noted that according to eqs .",
    "( [ v ] ) and ( jc ) the oscillation amplitude @xmath43 does not explicitly depend on the transmission coefficient , apart from the weak dependence through the depairing factor @xmath42 .",
    "the above analysis was based on the assumption that near the critical temperature , the current carried by quasiparticles can be represented by the expression in the normal state eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) , ignoring small corrections associated with the gap in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "the small gap alone , however , does not justify this assumption . in particular , when quasiparticles are transmitted between the left and right wires they may not be in the local thermal equilibrium with the respective condensates , that have been assumed when deriving eq.([psi ] ) . to take into account nonequilibrium effects",
    ", one needs to consider time dependent transport and relaxation of the quasiparticles .",
    "there are two physical effects that determine kinetics of quasiparticles in the superconducting wires .",
    "the first one is the so called @xcite charge ( or branch ) imbalance of electron and hole excitations .",
    "it is produced by quasiparticle tunneling between superconducting electrodes , leading to a quasiparticle distribution with a local chemical potential different from that of the condensate .",
    "this difference relaxes during a time much longer than the electron - phonon scattering time .",
    "another effect is related to condensate space - time oscillations .",
    "it dominates over the charge imbalance relaxation when @xmath44 is large enough .",
    "we will demonstrate that the spin injection then enables detection of collective condensate - quasiparticle modes , carlson - goldman modes @xcite which are characterized by oppositely directed oscillations of condensate and normal fluids .",
    "there is an important difference with respect to the usual josephson effect , since our device requires no net current @xmath20 .",
    "the usual josephson effect does not couple to carlson - goldman modes and is not reduced at low temperatures , @xmath45 .",
    "in contrast , to provide a counterflow we need excitations that vanish at low temperatures .",
    "the coupling to the collective modes is enabled by a spin - driven battery effect induced by the spin injection .",
    "let us now detail the calculations .",
    "assuming a small deviation from equilibrium we employ the linearized time dependent kinetic and ginzburg - landau equations in the diffusive regime @xcite , when the elastic mean free path is much less than the superconductor s coherence length , as well as other relevant length scales . in this case , the isotropic quasiparticle distribution function @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the spin projection , depends only on the energy @xmath48 and time @xmath49 . within the linear theory the singlet condensate couples to the spin - independent part @xmath50 of the distribution function .",
    "therefore , after ignoring small terms @xmath51 , the unperturbed spin - independent distributions takes the form of fermi equilibrium functions @xmath52 of the left and right wires with respective electrochemical potentials @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in its turn ,",
    "the corresponding gap functions of unperturbed condensates are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to see that in this unperturbed state the spin independent contribution to the quasiparticle current through the contact is given by the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) .",
    "taking into account above condensate functions one can easy obtain eqs .",
    "( [ psi ] ) and ( [ v ] ) . in the perturbed state",
    "we have @xmath57 ( we will skip here and below the labels @xmath58 and @xmath9 ) . since the perturbation violates the electron - hole symmetry , it gives rise to a spatially dependent potential @xmath59 near the contact .",
    "also , a correction to the order parameter @xmath60 appears . in order to simplify the further analysis",
    ", we assume that @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the electron - phonon relaxation rate .",
    "besides that , the critical supercurrent @xmath32 is taken small enough , so that the time dependence of all functions is dominated by harmonic oscillations .",
    "accordingly , we introduce the time fourier components @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . from refs .",
    "it follows that @xmath67 obeys the kinetic equation @xmath68where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the electron - phonon scattering integral , whose explicit form can be found in ref . .",
    "furthermore , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the spectral functions : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with @xmath77 . in its turn , the linearized ginzburg - landau equation takes the form @xmath78 we will employ the above equations for the analysis of our model in two limiting cases of weak and strong energy relaxation versus the josephson frequency , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , corresponding to very different physical situations . in the former case",
    "slow time variations of @xmath81 may be ignored , so that the quasiparticle kinetics is dominated by the charge imbalance of electron and hole excitations .",
    "the deviation from the thermodynamic equilibrium decreases with increasing distance from the contact on the characteristic length scale @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the charge imbalance relaxation time , that is much longer than @xmath84 . in the opposite high - frequency regime",
    "inelastic collision processes are not important , because the quasiparticle distribution oscillates fast .",
    "therefore , one can neglect @xmath63 and @xmath70 in eqs .",
    "( [ kinetic],[gl ] ) . in this case , since josephson oscillations of the condensate take place at zero total current , they strongly couple to carlson - goldman modes .",
    "therefore , one can expect such modes to be excited near the contact and propagate along the left and right wires .    in both low - frequency and high - frequency regimes , using eqs .",
    "( [ kinetic],[gl ] ) with a reduced form of @xmath70 from refs .",
    "and and taking into account the zero electric current condition , one arrives to the equation for the potential @xmath85where @xmath86 at @xmath79 and @xmath87at @xmath88 , where the sound velocity @xmath89 .",
    "( [ phi ] ) is well known .",
    "at @xmath79 it describes the charge imbalance relaxation @xcite , while in the opposite limit it gives the dispersion of carlson - goldman modes @xcite .    for our geometry ,",
    "when @xmath90 is much larger than the width and thickness of the wire , @xmath91 depends only on the coordinate @xmath92 along the wire . then , at @xmath79",
    ", @xmath91 exponentially decreases with increasing distance from the contact , while at @xmath88 it shows decaying oscillations .",
    "we assume that the left and right wires are of the same length @xmath58 .",
    "since the system is symmetric with respect to @xmath93 , the oscillating part of the electrochemical potential is @xmath94 at @xmath95 and @xmath96 at @xmath97 , where @xmath98 denotes the fourier component of @xmath37 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) has the form @xmath99with the boundary conditions @xmath100 and @xmath101where @xmath102 is the wire cross - section area and @xmath103 is the normal state conductivity .",
    "these boundary conditions provide a zero electric current of quasiparticles at the wire ends and the current equal to the injected one at @xmath104 . from eqs .",
    "( [ phi]),([potential])-([bc ] ) one obtains a periodic part of the injected current @xmath105where @xmath106hence , the result is a renormalization of @xmath107 in eq . ( [ i ] ) , such that @xmath108 . to find the voltage @xmath109 , the quasiparticle current ( [ reff ] ) must be equated with the josephson current . by this way we obtain a new expression for a time dependent part of @xmath0 , instead of the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) : @xmath110\\ ] ]",
    "let us analyse above results in some limiting cases . since @xmath111 in both cases of high frequencies @xmath112 and strong energy relaxation @xmath113 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ rw ] ) that @xmath114 .",
    "we thus obtain eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) , that is an expected result , because in these limits a deviation from equilibrium is small . on the other hand , the nonequilibrium effect of quasiparticle",
    "s kinetics becomes strong when @xmath115 .",
    "the assumed linearization condition , however , restricts this inequality . this condition can be expressed in the form @xmath116 only at small @xmath117 .",
    "it should be noted that , according to eq .",
    "( [ rw ] ) , @xmath118 can be enhanced due to resonances of josephson oscillations with collective modes at im@xmath119 , if they are not overdamped ( if re@xmath120 ) . @xmath118",

    "@xmath122 v , resulting in @xmath123s .",
    "since @xmath124s @xcite , a regime intermediate between charge imbalance relaxation and generation of carlson - goldman modes will be realized , with @xmath125 about several @xmath16 m .",
    "therefore , strong resonances in @xmath118 are not expected .",
    "one can evaluate @xmath126 , that is much less than @xmath127 .",
    "hence , in the considered parameter range eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) remains valid . in samples with higher polarizations",
    "@xmath128 and at larger spin current through the contact the josephson oscillation frequency is expected to be large enough to produce noticeable collective resonances of @xmath129 in eq .",

    "the above calculations of josephson voltage oscillations have been restricted to @xmath130 . at the larger gap",
    "the oscillation amplitude is expected to decrease , because less excitations are available to compensate the supercurrent through the contact .",
    "on the other hand , in this range one should take into account that besides quasiparticles the spin transport through the contact can be associated with triplet components of cooper pair states that appear due to spin dependent tunneling and nonequilibrium spin polarization of superconducting wires .",
    "further studies are needed to understand the effect of such transport .    in conclusion , we considered an ac josephson effect induced by a dc spin current through the contact whose transmittance depends on the spin orientation of tunneling electrons .",
    "the oscillations of the voltage across the contact at zero electric current have , in certain parameter range , harmonic time dependence with the frequency proportional to the spin current .",
