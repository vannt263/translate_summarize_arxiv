    "the computation of the fermion - induced quantum energy in the presence of a constant magnetic field ( or heisenberg - euler lagrangian ) , is a topic that has attracted the attention of authors from the early time of quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",

    "@xcite . however , the topics which are covered in these works are different to what this paper aims at .",

    "an interesting feature of the strong field asymptotic formulas , of eq .",
    "( 32 ) , ( 37 ) , ( 43 ) and ( 45 ) , is that they are independent of the infrared cut - off @xmath177 , for @xmath110 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in higher dimensional spaces constant magnetic fields are characterized by the electromagnetic tensor @xmath178 where @xmath179 , which has more than one independent components ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . these more general magnetic fields are physical objects which are introduced by the higher dimensional theory .",
    "even these fields have not been observed directly in low energy physics , they can be relevant physically indirectly .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of a magnetic field in the intrinsic space can be used as a tool for supersymmetry breaking . in this paper , we have assumed the special case of a magnetic field which is directed toward the @xmath2 axis of the physical space .",
    "the computation of the quantum energy in the most general case of a higher dimensional magnetic field is beyond the scope of this paper and could be a topic of further investigation .",
    "we emphasize again , that this extra - dimension u(1 ) model with massive fermions ( or with a massive scalar field ) , can not be viewed as an extra - dimension extension of qed .",
    "it is only a toy model for the study of the effects of the extra dimensions .",
    "thus , the results of this paper are only suggestive and not realistic",
    ".    however , we can use the @xmath0 model in order to extract results for a more realistic case .",
    "we will assume an extra - dimension version of the standard model , before the electroweak symmetry ( @xmath180 ) breaking .",
    "then the @xmath0 symmetry , of the @xmath0 model of this work , corresponds to the @xmath181 of the standard model , and the magnetic field corresponds to a hypercharge @xmath181 magnetic field .",
    "then the effective energy , per unit volume , for @xmath136 , in the case of @xmath181 reads : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the renormalized hypercharge @xmath181 coupling , and @xmath141 is a free parameter ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the contributions to quantum energy are come from the spinor and scalar fields of the extra - dimension version of the standard model , and not from the vector fields .",
    "if we take into account that the main features of the quantum energy are the same for spinor and scalar fields ( see sections 4 and 5 ) , we expect the quantum energy @xmath8 , for @xmath184 and @xmath136 , to be positive and to behave as @xmath185 ( for @xmath149 see eq .",
    "thus , for an appropriate negative value of the free parameter @xmath141 it is possible for the effective energy to exhibit a minimum for @xmath186 , which corresponds to a stable hypercharge @xmath181 magnetic field .",
    "note , that in the above mechanism we have completely ignore the effects of the other possible higher order operators , and the negative value of the free parameter @xmath141 has been put by hand .",
    "it is worth to note that there are several scenarios for the generation of primordial magnetic fields , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . especially in the case of string",
    "cosmology , sufficiently large seeds for generating the observed galactic magnetic fields can be obtained from the amplification of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations , due to the inflationary dynamics of the dilaton , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , in the mechanism we present above",
    ", we assume that primordial magnetic fields may be created as the minimum of the one loop effective energy .",
    "however the magnetic fields that obtain from this mechanism , if we take into account the evolution of the early universe and the conservation of the magnetic flux ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , can not give the correct size of the seed fields which are responsible for the generation of the present days observed galactic magnetic fields .",
    "finally , we emphasize that a construction of a reliable scenario for the generation of primordial magnetic fields is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our main motivation is to investigate a classical topic like the heisenberg euler lagrangian in the case of extra dimensions , and to note the rapid power growing of the quantum energy in this case .",
