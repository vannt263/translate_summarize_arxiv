    "transiting exoplanetary systems provide us a unique probe to investigate the dynamical history of planetary systems discovered today .",
    "the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( hereafter , the rm effect ) , which was originally discussed for stellar eclipsing binaries @xcite , is an apparent radial velocity ( hereafter , rv ) anomaly during a planetary transit caused by a partial occultation of the rotating stellar surface ( e.g. , @xcite ) . through the rm effect , one can estimate the angle between the stellar rotation axis and the planetary orbital axis projected onto the sky plane . this angle , which we denote by @xmath1 , is strongly related to formation and migration history of close - in exoplanets .",
    "the standard formation theory of close - in gas - giants ( hot - jupiters ) suggests they formed outside the so called `` snow - line '' , which is usually located at a few au away from the host star , and then migrated inward due to some migration process ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while migration processes such as disk - planet interactions ( type i or ii migration ) predict relatively small values of @xmath1 , dynamical processes including planet - planet scattering and kozai cycles might produce a large value of @xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed distribution of @xmath1 and its host star dependence would help reveal the dynamical history of exoplanetary systems .    to this point",
    ", the rm effect has been measured for approximately 30 transiting hot - jupiters ( see table  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the observational results indicate that the spin - orbit axes in some of the systems are well - aligned ( at least on the sky ) , but others show significant misalignment .",
    "eccentric exoplanetary systems , where @xmath2 , and systems whose central stars are massive ( @xmath3 ) are more likely to show strong misalignment @xcite .",
    "specifically , out of the thirteen eccentric transiting systems ( corot-9 , corot-10 , gj  436 , hat - p-2 , hat - p-11 , hat - p-14 , hat - p-15 , hd  17156 , hd  80606 , wasp-8 , wasp-14 , wasp-17 , and xo-3 ) , the rm effect has been observed for seven systems ( hat - p-2 , hd  17156 , hd  80606 , wasp-8 , wasp-14 , wasp-17 , and xo-3 ) . among them , five systems have been reported to have significant spin - orbit misalignment ( hd  80606 , wasp-8 , wasp-14 , wasp-17 , and xo-3 ) based on measurements of the rm effect .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported the possibility of spin - orbit `` misalignment along the line - of - sight '' in other eccentric systems ( e.g. , hd  17156 and hat - p-14 ) based on an analysis of stellar rotational periods ( note that the sky - projected spin - orbit alignment angle for hd  17156 has been reported as @xmath4 by @xcite ) .    in this paper , we focus on the rm effect of the super - neptune hat - p-11b .",
    "so far , the rm effect has been observed only for hot - jupiters . in order to obtain a clearer insight into planetary migration processes ,",
    "we need to measure the rm effect for a wider range of planetary and stellar parameters .",
    "the transiting super - neptune exoplanet hat - p-11b @xcite was detected by the hatnet transit survey @xcite and confirmed by subsequent rv measurements at keck with hires .",
    "hat - p-11b orbits a bright k dwarf star ( @xmath5 mag ) with an orbital period of @xmath6 days .",
    "its planetary radius , @xmath7 , is one of the smallest among the known transiting exoplanets .",
    "although hat - p-11b is a difficult target for an rm measurement due to its small size , the significant eccentricity ( @xmath8 ) makes it very interesting for attempting the challenging observation .",
    "the detection of the rm effect for neptune - sized planets are of great importance for making further progress in studying migration histories .",
    "the rest of the present paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : sec2 ] we report on new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the hat - p-11 system using the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) installed on the 8.2 m subaru telescope , and the lcogt 2.0 m faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) .",
    "the new observations include simultaneous transit spectroscopy and photometry of hat - p-11b on ut 2010 may 27 as well as several out - transit rv datasets to determine the orbital ( keplerian ) motion of hat - p-11 .",
    "data analysis is presented in section [ s : sec3 ] .",
    "we combine the new photometric and rv dataset with the published rv data by @xcite and simultaneously determine the orbital and rm parameters in section [ s : sec4 ] .",
    "we report that the rv anomaly during the transit shows a possible spin - orbit misalignment in the system .",
    "finally , section [ s : sec5 ] summarizes our findings .",
    "we conducted spectroscopic observations of hat - p-11 with subaru / hds on ut 2010 may 21 , 27 , and july 1 .",
    "we employed the std - i2b setup on may 21 and 27 , and the std - i2a setup on july 1 . due to the bad",
    "seeing during the may observations , we needed to broaden the slit width , which we set to 0.8@xmath9 , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath10 .",
    "we set it to 0.4@xmath9 for the july observation , corresponding to @xmath11 .",
    "we observed the target with the iodine cell for a precise wavelength calibration .",
    "adopting exposure times of @xmath12-@xmath13 seconds , we obtained a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 150200 .",
    "we reduced the raw data with the standard iraf procedure , and extracted one - dimensional spectra .",
    "we then input the spectra into the rv analysis routine .",
    "the rv analysis for subaru / hds is described in detail by @xcite and @xcite . specifically , in order to obtain the stellar template spectrum , we adopted the method developed by @xcite , which uses a high s / n , high resolution observed spectrum of the host star without the iodine cell .",
    "we took that stellar template spectrum during the july  1 observation , and deconvolve it with the instrumental profiles , which were estimated by the rapid rotator plus i@xmath14 spectrum .",
    "the output relative rvs are summarized in table  [ hyo1 ] .",
    "the reported errors based on the rv analysis do not include stellar `` jitter '' , which have been reported to be significant for hat - p-11 .",
    "the measured rvs as well as the published keck data by @xcite are plotted in figure [ rv_all ] .",
    ".radial velocities measured with subaru / hds . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 85mm,85mm)rv_residual_std4.eps    ( 85mm,85mm)simultaneous.eps    the estimated stellar rotational velocity @xmath15  km  s@xmath16 by our rm analysis agrees with the spectroscopically measured value within 1@xmath17 . in order to confirm the robustness of the estimated spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath1 , we test the following two cases .",
    "first , instead of letting @xmath18 be a free parameter , we fix it as @xmath19 km s@xmath16 ( the spectroscopically measured value ) and fit the other five parameters . as a result , we obtain @xmath20 , in good agreement with the main result described above .",
    "second , we changed the planet to star radius ratio to the value determined by @xcite , of @xmath21 , based on a photometric follow - up observation of the system . adopting their results",
    "we obtain @xmath22 , which is also consistent with the main result within 1@xmath17 .",
    "as expected in this case , we obtain a slightly smaller rotational velocity ( @xmath23 km s@xmath16 ) than the main result . in both cases",
    "above , we find no significant difference in the other fitted parameters ( @xmath24 ) from the main result .",
    "the spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath1 is very sensitive to the rvs taken out - of - transit , which determine the keplerian motion of hat - p-11b .",
    "our new dataset contains two , nine , and twelve out - of - transit rvs taken on ut 2010 may 21 , 27 , and july 1 , respectively .",
    "however , the number of rvs might not be sufficient in systems as hat - p-11 , where the planet is small and its host star is active .",
    "in addition , since the observations in may and july are separated by roughly a month , the long - term rv drift reported by @xcite might have affected the result .",
    "if the long - term rv drift is actually caused by a secondary planet lurking in the hat - p-11 system , the rv drift should modulate with time . in order to test the effect of a rv drift variation",
    ", we artificially increased the rv drift from @xmath25 m s@xmath16 day@xmath16 to @xmath26 m s@xmath16 day@xmath16 .",
    "this treatment resulted in a slightly larger value for the spin - orbit misalignment angle ( @xmath27 ) and a smaller value for the projected stellar rotational velocity ( @xmath28 km s@xmath16 ) , both of which are consistent with the main result shown in table  [ hyo2 ] .",
    "this result indicates that the long - term rv drift has less impact on estimating @xmath1 , as long as @xmath29 does not exceed 0.10 m s@xmath16 day@xmath16 .",
    "although the measurement of the rm effect in the hat - p-11 system seems challenging due to the small size of the planet and large stellar jitter , our result suggests a significant spin - orbit misalignment of the system . as we have described in section [ s : sec1 ] , five out of the seven eccentric hot - jupiters where the rm effect has been observed have significant spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "our result suggests that the super - neptune hat - p-11b migrated to its present location by dynamical scattering or a long - term perturbation by an outer body , similarly to other eccentric hot - jupiters .",
    "by contrast , the fraction of misaligned systems with circular orbits is significantly smaller ( e.g. , corot-1 , hat - p-7 , wasp-15 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested the interesting possibility that hot - jupiters have large initial spin - orbit misalignment caused by dynamical processes , but the host stars obliquity could _ decline _ due to tidal interactions between hot - jupiters and the stellar convective zone .",
    "since convective zones are particularly well - developed in cooler and less massive stars , we are likely to observe spin - orbit alignment around cool host stars .",
    "although hat - p-11 is a very cool star ( @xmath30 k ) , this hypothesis also claims that the decay timescale of host star s obliquity is larger when the planet has a lower mass and a distant orbit from the host star ( see eq .  2 of @xcite ) . according to their criteria ,",
    "the hat - p-11 system can show a spin - orbit misalignment mainly because of the lower mass of hat - p-11b .",
    "comparison of the spin - orbit misalignment angle for hat - p-11b with those of other transiting hot - neptunes ( e.g. , gj  436b and kepler-4b ) is quite interesting , because their host stars are of different spectral types ( kepler-4 is a g0 star and gj 436 is an m2.5 star ) , while hat - p-11b , gj 436b , and kepler-4b have similar planetary radii and masses ( e.g. , butler et al .",
    "2004 ; shporer 2009 ; borucki et al .",
    "further observational investigations of formation and migration history of hot - neptunes will be an interesting topic in the next decade .",
    "we have measured the rm effect for one of the smallest transiting exoplanets known to date , hat - p-11b .",
    "the exoplanet has a significant eccentricity and is an interesting target for the rm effect .",
    "the observed rv anomaly during the transit suggests a significant spin - orbit misalignment of the system , of @xmath0 . to confirm the spin - orbit misalignment decisively",
    ", however , it is necessary to measure even more rvs of the system during and outside transits , as well as to better characterize the long - term rv variation . although challenging , the measurement of the rm effect for neptune - sized exoplanets will extend the parameter space where planetary formation and migration theories will be studied in the near future .",
