    "in the unified agn model , a type 2 agn is seen from an angle close to the plane of the central accretion disk . on this plane ,",
    "the accretion disk and the broad line regions are obscured by an outer molecular torus , while a bi - polar jet emanating from the nucleus is perpendicular to the plane@xcite .",
    "the type 1 agns are then these objects that we are able to see directly into the central regions .",
    "several studies have revealed that the angle between the orientation of the kiloparsec - scale jet and the normal to the host galaxy plane has a wide / random distribution based on the samples of dozens of radio galaxies@xcite .",
    "these results lead to a conclusion that the internal gas fuelling the black hole may not be co - aligned with the outer gas forming the stellar disk .    on the other hand ,",
    "the agns are known to be biased sample of inclinations of stellar disks for a long time .",
    "both the optically selected ( mostly type 1 ) and the soft x - ray selected seyfert galaxies show a bias against the edge - on galaxies , while the hard x - ray selected sample do not show such a bias@xcite .",
    "@xcite found an excess of face - on galaxies hosting both type 1 and type 2 agns and explained it with a substantial amount of obscuring material coplanar with the stellar disk(see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the intermediate type agns(1.8,1.9 ) are mostly found in edge - on galaxies and concluded a 100 pc - scale torus coplanar with the stellar disk .    in this study",
    ", we use a large type 2 agn sample selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sdss ) to check whether the stellar disks of their hosts are biased to edge - on views .",
    "we then further check whether this bias is better explained by a dust layer coplanar with the galaxy plane or by an intrinsic alignment between the nuclear obscurer and stellar disk .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we study the axis ratio distribution of the agns and make comparisons to that of a well - defined sample of non - active disk galaxies . with the distributions of the shape paraments of the spiral disks concluded in section 3 , we then build toy models to quantify the biased axis ratios of the agn hosts in section 4 .",
    "finally , we make brief conclusions and discussions in section 5 .",
    "our type 2 agns are selected from the complete spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the data release 7(dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of sdss using the empirical relation between the emission line ratios proposed by @xcite(see their equation 1 ) .",
    "the emission line data are take from the mpa - jhu dr7 release of spectrum measurements(http://www.mpa - garching.mpg.de / sdss / dr7/).we use the sdss parameter ` @xmath2 ' and criteria @xmath3 , is defined in @xcite through fcomposite = @xmath2 fdev + ( 1 - @xmath2 ) fexp , where fcomposite , fdev and fexp are the composite , de vaucouleurs and exponential fluxes of the object respectively . ] which ensures that the galaxy flux is dominated by an exponential(disk ) component , to select the agns hosted by disk galaxies .",
    "the number of the type 2 agns hosted by disk galaxies is then 32,618 .",
    "the inclination of a stellar disk is informed by its apparent axis ratio @xmath4 .",
    "if a disk is circular and thin , then @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the inclination of the disk ( the angle between the line - of - sight and the normal of the disk ) .",
    "if this disk is viewed from arbitrary directions , the resulted @xmath4 follows a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 .    for a more realistic triaxial ellipsoid model ,",
    "the observed @xmath4 is further dependent on two shape parameters , the disk height @xmath7 and the disk ellipticity @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are the major , middle and minor axis of the ellipsoid respectively@xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 distribution is then dependent on both of the shape parameter(@xmath10 ) and viewing angle distributions .",
    "the galaxies with different physical properties ( e.g. mass and size ) are shown to have different intrinsic shape parameters@xcite .",
    "in addition , the sample selection effects could also introduce biases into the measured @xmath4 distribution of a galaxy sample .",
    "for example , the seeing would make the galaxies with small apparent sizes look rounder@xcite .",
    "therefore , to quantify the inclinations of the disks of the agn hosts , their shape parameters must be well - defined or controlled .",
    "the agn host galaxies are known to have distinctive physical properties .",
    "for example , the agns reside mostly in massive galaxies@xcite and the strength of the nucleus activity is also correlated with its host property@xcite . for our sample of agns hosted by disk galaxies , we find that they are biased towards these hosts with large bulge component , high concentration and old stellar population . to quantify the sample properties of these agn hosts , we build a control sample of galaxies ( without agn phenomena ) from the same galaxy catalogue of sdss , which are selected to have the same sample size and the same distributions of stellar mass , redshift , size , concentration , @xmath11 and @xmath12(the 4000 break spectra index , a rough stellar age indicator ) as the agn hosts .",
    "we believe that this control sample of non - active galaxies shares the same stellar properties and selection effects(e.g .",
    "redshift distribution ) as the agn hosts so that they would have the same @xmath4 distribution if their viewing angles were both random .",
    "we compare the @xmath4 distributions of the agn hosts to the control non - active galaxies .",
    "the result is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "the agn sample(solid histogram ) has systematically more numbers of galaxies in smaller @xmath4 bins than the control galaxy sample(dotted histogram ) . for a better view of this over - density",
    ", we show the number ratios of the agns to the control galaxies ( @xmath13 ) in different @xmath4 bins in fig . [ model ] .",
    "as one can see , the @xmath13 decreases with the increasing of @xmath4 systemtically .",
    "the type 2 agns show both an excess of edge on objects and deficit of round objects . since the galaxy sample have already been controlled to have the same physical properties and selection effects as the agn hosts , the systemical bias in @xmath4 distribution of the agn hosts could only be stemmed from their preferred ( non - random ) viewing angles .",
    "the bias towards the small axis ratios for the agns is basically consistent with the scenario that the nuclear obscurer is partly co - aligned with the stellar disk .    ,",

    "however , for our control sample of galaxies , the sample selection criteria is not well - defined and the goodness of fit is also bad when only single gaussian distributions are assumed for @xmath14 and @xmath16 . as an alternative , the control galaxy sample can be viewed as a combination of sub - samples of galaxies , where the @xmath14 and @xmath15 distributions both follow gaussian distributions for each sub - sample .",

    "@xmath47 corresponds to a mean tilt angle @xmath49 .",
    "we emphasis here that our assumption of the gaussian distribution of @xmath50 is in a arbitrary way , however , the mean tilt angle ( @xmath51 ) is quite robust and independent of the shape of the @xmath21 distribution .",
    "we show the 68 ( @xmath52 ) and 90 ( @xmath53 ) percent of the confidence levels of our model parameters in the sub - panel of fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "as we can see , the parameter @xmath24 is degenerated with @xmath35 to a certain extent .",
    "the effect of increasing the torus opening angle @xmath24 is similar to the increasing of the effective tilt angle @xmath35 , which both result in a more randomized viewing angles of the disks of agn hosts .",
    "therefore , an independent measurement of @xmath24 from the type 2 agn fraction is crucial to constrain the tilt angle @xmath21 in our model .      in this section ,",
    "we test the scenario that the over - density of the edge - on galaxies of type 2 agns is caused by an extra dust layer aligned with the stellar disk .",
    "therefore , we no more assume that the nuclear obscurer is aligned with the stellar disk as that in the aligned torus model(section [ torus ] ) , but consider it being randomly oriented . besides the random orientated torus , the dust aligned with the stellar disk will obscure the nucleus when it is viewed as edge - on .    using the denotations as in aligned torus model ,",
    "a randomly oriented nuclear torus means that the orientations of the stellar disk and torus plane are independent of each other , i.e. @xmath31 follows a random distribution between 0 and 1 . for its opening angle , we set @xmath54 , the lower limit of the aligned torus model , since we have an extra component of type 2 agns obscured by the host - aligned dust layer . for host - aligned obscurer",
    ", we assume its height is the same as the stellar disk . thus , for a stellar disk with height @xmath14",
    ", its nucleus will be obscured when its viewing angles satisfies tan(@xmath20)@xmath55 .",
    "we then combine these two types of obscurers and get the final type 2 agn sample .",
    "the other model settings and procedures are the same as in aligned tours model .",
    "we show the model prediction as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ model ] . as we can see , this extra stellar obscurer model indeed predicts over - density of the low axis ratio galaxies for the agn sample .",
    "however , this over - density mostly takes place at @xmath56 . for the others with @xmath57 ,",
    "the predicted @xmath13 is almost a constant , whereas the observations show continuous decreasing of type 2 agns in more round galaxies .",
    "this is because that most of the stellar disks having @xmath58(see fig .",
    "[ btoa ] ) .",
    "therefore , this model prediction shows significantly poorer fitting(@xmath59 , outside the 99.9% confidence interval of the @xmath60 distribution with 8 freedoms ) than the aligned torus model .",
    "however , we would mention that there is no tuneable parameter in this stellar dust model , whereas the aligned torus model has two free parameters . setting @xmath24 to be a free parameter in the stellar dust model",
    "does not help , because the torus was assumed to be orientated randomly .",
    "however , assuming that the stellar dust layer following the same shape of the stars might be too simplistic .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment of the distribution of the stellar dust might improve the fit(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , but is out of the range of this study .",
    "in this study , we select a sample of type 2 agns hosted by spiral galaxies from the dr7 of the sdss . we build a control sample of non - active galaxies to the agn sample by matching their observational and physical properties in detail . by comparing with the control sample , we find that the agn hosts are systematically biased to edge - on views . by modelling the height and ellipticity of the disk galaxies with a non - parametric technic , we further find that this systematical bias can not be quantified by an extra dust layer aligned with stellar disk but can be nicely reproduced by assuming an average tilt angle of @xmath61 degree between the torus plane and stellar disk .",
    "some of the assumptions in our model are simplified , e.g. the constant type 2 agn fraction .",
    "there are studies suggesting that the opening angle of the torus is correlated with the central agn luminosity . for high luminosity agns ,",
    "the distance of the torus from the nucleus is further ( ` receding torus model ' ) so that the torus opening angel and the type 2 agn fraction @xmath25 are smaller@xcite .",
    "most of our agns are low luminosity objects(@xmath62 } } < 10 ^ 8l_\\odot$ ] ) , and the type 2 agn fraction has been shown to be roughly a constant in this luminosity region@xcite .",
    "a separation of our sample into two sub - samples according to @xmath62}}$ ] also would not show any significant differences but reduce the goodness of the statistics .    in the unified agn diagram ,",
    "the torus lies on the same plane of the accretion disk . in this case",
    ", the mean tilt angle between the torus plane and the stellar disk constrained from our model could also be understood as the mean tilt between the accretion disk and stellar disk .",
