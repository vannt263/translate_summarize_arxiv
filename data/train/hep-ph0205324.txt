    "based models the pomeron is usually regarded as a two - gluon state . within the two - gluon exchange model the two - gluon coupling with the proton can be written as follows : @xmath6 here the structure proportional to @xmath7 determines the spin - non - flip contribution .",

    "the diffractive @xmath0 production in the lepton - proton reaction is determined by the photon - two - gluon fusion .",
    "the spin - average and spin - dependent cross section can be written in the form @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a normalization coefficient , the functions @xmath12 are determined by a sum of all graphs integrated over the gluon momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "the contribution of the quark spd to the @xmath1 asymmetry should be important .",
    "to conclude , we would like to emphasize that the diffraction contribution to the @xmath1 asymmetry is found to be proportional to the ratio of @xmath49 structure functions .",
