    "we present a generalization of maxwell time [ 1 ] , which can also be referred - to as generalized maxwellian relaxation time [ 2 ] , a family of which is present in the evolution equations of higher - order hydrodynamics , also dubbed as mesoscopic hydro - thermodynamics ( mht ) [ 3 - 6 ] .",
    "such generalized maxwell times are associated to the dampening of densities of particles ( molecules in a classical fluid ) or quasi - particles ( bloch - band electrons , harmonic phonons , magnons , polaritons , etc . , in solid state matter , in semiconductors , for example ) , and of their energy density , together with the fluxes of all orders of both .",
    "the origin of maxwell times goes back to the fundamental article by j. c. maxwell in 1867 on the dynamical theory of gases [ 1 ] , in what is related to viscoelasticity and which is being expressed as the quotient of the dynamical viscosity coefficient with the modulus of rigidity .",
    "according to maxwell it may be called the `` time of relaxation '' of the elastic force .",
    "it has been noticed [ 2 ] that given a fluid subjected to some variable external forces , which vary periodically in time with frequency @xmath0 , of the period @xmath1 is large compared with maxwell time , i.e. @xmath2 , the fluid under consideration will be have as an ordinary viscous fluid . if however , the frequency @xmath0 is sufficiently large ( so that @xmath3 , the fluid will be have as an amorphous solid .",

    "_ rests on the characteristics of the hydrodynamic motion that develops under the given experimental procedure_.    inclusion of higher and higher - order fluxes implies in describing a motion involving increasing knudsen numbers per hydrodynamic mode , that is , governed by smaller and smaller wavelengths  larger and larger wavenumbers  accompanied by higher and higher frequencies . in a qualitative manner , we can say that , as a general  thumb rule \" , the criterion indicates that _ a more and more restricted contraction can be used when larger and larger are the prevalent wavelengths in the motion_. therefore , in simpler words , when the motion becomes more and more smooth in space and time the more reduced can be the dimension of the space of basic macrovariables to be used for the description of the nonequilibrium thermodynamic state of the system .",
    "it can be conjectured a general criterion for contraction , namely , a contraction of order @xmath279 ( meaning keeping the densities and their fluxes up to order @xmath279 ) can be introduced once we can show that in the spectrum of wavelengths , which characterize the motion , predominate those larger than a  frontier \" one , @xmath280 where @xmath281 is of the order of the thermal velocity and @xmath282 and @xmath283 the corresponding _ maxwell times _ associated to the @xmath279 and @xmath284 order fluxes .",

    "we can say that it is expected once the hydrodynamic motion is a collective one composed of the contribution of all the phonon modes .",
    "as in the previous case maxwell times follow a hierarchy involving ever decreasing values as the order of the fluxes increases .    finally , in section v , for the case of doped polar semiconductors , the maxwell times associated to the hydrodynamic motion of the electrons in bloch bands have been obtained .",
    "they are mainly determined by the presence of the polar frhlich interaction between electrons and phonons and they follow a hierarchy of values , which is dependent on the ratio of the phonon energy @xmath285 with the electron thermal ( kinetic ) energy : it implies in a series of decreasing values as long as the quasitemperature of the  hot \" electrons is higher than the einstein temperature of the phonons .      * in memoriam : * _ with very sad feelings , we regret to report the passing away of our dear colleague urea rosas vasconcellos , a genuine , devoted and extremely competent teacher and researcher with fervent dedication to theoretical physics in the condensed matter area .",
