    "it has been of interest that whether or not the initial hard scattering process is modified in relativistic heavy ion collisions , after the suppression of high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) hadron yields was discovered in au+au collisions at @xmath6=130gev in rhic year-2000 run  @xcite .",
    "the first @xmath3+au collision experiment was carried out in rhic year-2003 run and confirmed that the suppression attributes to a final state interaction of hard scattered partons with a medium created in au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "after these results were published , many theoretical works have been dedicated to precisely determine the initial state effect that affects to the evaluation of the final state effect such as parton energy loss .",

    "the hard scattering process is factorized into a fragmentation function , a reaction cross - section , and a parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "since the @xmath3+au collisions will not produce a bulk hot dense medium , the yield difference of the hard scattering probe in @xmath3+au and @xmath10 collisions are predominantly from the modification of pdf .",
    "therefore , the nuclear modification factor @xmath4 ( @xmath11 ) is expected to reflect the modification of pdf .",
    "eskola and companies tried to construct the centrality dependent nuclear pdf using the previously published @xmath1 @xmath4 result as shown in figure  [ fig2_npdf_eskola ]  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the statistical uncertainty is too large to observe the centrality dependence of the nuclear pdf .",

    "although jets and single identified hadrons can not be directly compared at the same @xmath0 , they are agreeing each other very well within quoted uncertainties . for reader",
    "s sake , it may be useful to note that the mean @xmath33(@xmath34 ) for @xmath1 and @xmath2 is @xmath320.7 .",
    "it was found that the @xmath4 is strongly centrality dependent ; the most central collisions show a small suppression , while the most peripheral collisions show a sizable enhancement , compared to the expectation from @xmath10 collisions .",
    "it should also be noted that the enhancement in the peripheral collisions increases as going to higher @xmath0 .",
    "this trend shows that the nuclear pdf may be strongly dependent of impact parameters as opposed to what was predicted by theoretical models . in order to investigate the suppression / enhancement trend with",
    "reduced systematic uncertainties , the ratio of the yield in central to peripheral collisions ( @xmath5 ) is computed and shown in figure  [ fig9_rcp ] . in this ratio , the error from @xmath10 baseline measurement will be excluded .",
    "it was found that the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and jet @xmath5 show the same trend and are consistent each other within even smaller uncertainties .",
    "the decreasing trend as going to higher @xmath0 is consistent with the fact that the @xmath4 is enhanced in peripheral collisions and suppressed in central collisions .",
    "before one concludes that the nuclear pdf is strongly impact parameter dependent , one may want to revisit some global features in @xmath3+au collisions such as triggering or centrality definition . in any collisions",
    ", one has to generate a trigger using signals from detectors whose efficiencies are not 100% in reality .",
    "the efficiency of a trigger is often particle multiplicity dependent .",
    "therefore , when triggering minimum bias events in small collision system such like @xmath3+au , the peripheral collisions are most biased . in figure",
    "[ fig10_hardfact ] , we tried to sketch the collision dynamics for events with low and high @xmath0 observables in peripheral collisions .",

    "as explained before , we trigger minimum bias events and define their centrality classes based on the charge signals from the south side bbc ( au - going direction ) .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig10_hardfact ] , the soft - process - dominated events emit particles isotropically . therefore , the bbc charge is proportional to the centrality .",
    "however , in the case that hardest jets are produced , less energy will be available for soft production at high @xmath2 , e.g. , at the bbc location .",
    "this leads to a possible @xmath0 dependence of the trigger efficiency in most peripheral collisions .",
    "we performed a simulation study for the simplest case , @xmath10 collisions , using pythia  @xcite and ampt  @xcite event generators to see this effect .",
    "the left side of the figure  [ fig11_ppbias_pythia ] shows the number of bbc hits as a function of jet @xmath35 obtained from a pythia simulation .",
    "pythia simulation of the number of bbc hits ( left ) and the fraction of jets seen in central arm when requiring bbc hits ( right ) .",
    "]    since the collision system is symmetric , we took the bbc hit distributions from both south and north sides .",
    "the error bars show rms of the distributions . as going to higher @xmath35",
    ", the number of hits in bbc decreases , and the trigger efficiency of events is reduced as shown in the right side of the same figure . at @xmath3230gev /",
    "c the trigger efficiency becomes 70% .",
    "figure  [ fig12_ppbias_ampt ] shows a ampt simulation of @xmath10 minimum bias collisions .",
    "ampt simulation of the number of bbc hits ( left ) and the fraction of @xmath1 s seen in central arm when requiring bbc hits ( right ) . ]    in this figure , the number of bbc hits and the trigger efficiency are plotted against the @xmath0 of @xmath1 s .",
    "the yield of @xmath1 s starts decreasing at @xmath324gev/@xmath22 , and reaches to @xmath3230% deficit at 14gev/@xmath22 .",
    "the trend and magnitude are found to be consistent with what pythia simulation showed , by taking the difference of the energy scale between jets and @xmath1 s into account .",
    "this implies a trigger bias is expected from a simple hard scattering kinematics , and manifests both in jet @xmath35 and single hadron @xmath0 .",
    "we are now looking for a same effect in the @xmath3+au collision case using the simulations .",
