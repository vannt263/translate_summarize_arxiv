    "let us construct its boundary @xmath109 .",
    "we start at @xmath88 and go to @xmath89 along an arc of a horizontal oval .",
    "no other points in @xmath28 or @xmath103 belong to this arc , since only one point of each generator is on the same oval .",

    "this shows that @xmath134 is indeed a chain complex .    to show that @xmath135 and @xmath136 are chain maps , i.e. @xmath137 and @xmath138",
    ", we again use @xmath139 , which is a consequence of lemma [ sublemma ] .    finally , we would like to show that the new differential @xmath140 can be realized by counting of maslov index one domains for a new system of curves .",
    "we write @xmath141 if @xmath86 .",
    "assume @xmath141 and @xmath28 , @xmath33 do not contain the corners of the bigon @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "for all such @xmath28 and @xmath33 , we also have @xmath142 , and they are connected by a maslov index one domain @xmath143 .",

    "note that @xmath151 , since any domain connecting @xmath152 to @xmath149 contains either the bigon with negative orientation or basepoints , hence they do not count for the differential .",
    "however , the new system of ovals contains a domain connecting @xmath152 to @xmath149 which is obtained from @xmath153 by shortening the oval .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure [ poly ] , where @xmath152 and @xmath149 are given by black and white points respectively ; @xmath33 is obtained from @xmath152 by switching the black point on the dashed oval to @xmath89 and the upper black point to the white point on the same oval ; @xmath28 is obtained from @xmath33 by switching @xmath89 to @xmath88 .",
    "8    it remains to show that the domain , obtained from @xmath153 by shortening the oval , belongs to @xmath83 .",
    "the domain is obtained by connecting @xmath154 to @xmath155 by two arcs shown on the right of figure 4 , i.e. the domain is connected .",

    "the complex @xmath162 is obtained from the complex with long ovals by applying lemma [ bigon ] several times , until the complex has @xmath38 as the set of generators .",
    "this subsection aims to give a recursive definition of the multiplicity @xmath163 of @xmath149 in the differential @xmath164 for all @xmath165 . in general",
    ", it will depend on the order in which the ovals were shortened .",
    "let us fix this order .",
    "if @xmath166 is a polygon we count it with multiplicity one .",
    "for any other domain in @xmath83 we prolongate the last oval that was shortened to obtain this domain , and show whether in the resulting complex @xmath167 , one can find @xmath28 and @xmath33 with @xmath168 , @xmath146 and @xmath169 as in the proof of lemma [ bigon ] .",
    "if there is an odd number of such @xmath28 and @xmath33 , then @xmath170 , otherwise the multiplicity is zero . to determine @xmath171 and @xmath172 in the new complex , we prolongate the next oval , and continue to do so until the domains in question are polygons which always count .",
    "in fact , the algorithm terminates already when the domains in question are strongly indecomposable without bad components ( as defined in the next section ) since they all count for the differential ( cf .",
    "theorem 2.1 below ) .      it remains to compute the homology of our complex .    by lemma [ bigon ] , the complex @xmath40 is homotopy equivalent to the complex with long ovals .",
    "the homotopy preserves both gradings , since @xmath61 count only maslov index one domains without basepoints inside .",
    "the complex @xmath62 coincides with the complex computing the hat version of link floer homology from the genus zero heegaard splitting of @xmath24 with extra basepoints ( see @xcite for summary ) .",
    "the relative maslov and alexander of these two complexes are also the same .",

    "suppose @xmath212 , and our domain is indecomposable .",
    "let us denote by @xmath53 the @xmath19th component .",
    "let us first assume that there are no cuts ending at @xmath53 . in this case the two cuts from the obtuse corner @xmath89connect @xmath53 with some other components which are all @xmath89connected by induction .",
    "if there is a component connected with @xmath53 by two cuts , then it is @xmath89connected with the outside exactly in the case when @xmath53 has this property . to check this , it is sufficient to find a required path for two choices of @xmath89 ( before and after one corner ) on this component",
    ". an example is shown in figure [ 0nc ] .",
    "hence , when all cuts ending at @xmath53 come from components connected with @xmath53 by two cuts",
    "( as in figure [ 0nc ] ) , then @xmath53 is @xmath89connected to the outside by the previous argument .    8    in the case , when @xmath213 is connected with @xmath53 by just one cut or @xmath53 and @xmath122 exchange their cuts , all components are again @xmath89connected to each other except when the following happens .",
    "the path described in definition 2.2 after leaving @xmath53 ( along one of the cuts ) comes back to @xmath53 without visiting all other components .",
    "since this path leaves and enter any component along cuts at odd distance ( compare figure [ 0na ] ) , and has no self intersections , it can be used to decompose the domain , which contradicts the assumption .",
    "8    it remains to consider the case where @xmath79 has straight corners , or special components , i.e. ovals with a common corner of two generators .",
    "we proceed by induction on the number of special components .",
    "assume that we have one special component .",
    "then the cut from the straight corner @xmath89connects this component with any other one ( otherwise not connected with the special one ) by the previous argument .",
    "the obvious induction completes the proof .",
    "the proof is again by induction on the number of boundary components @xmath207 in the domain . if @xmath214 , it is easy to see by prolonging ovals that any immersed polygon counts .",
    "assume that for @xmath211 , the claim holds .",
    "suppose our complex has a strongly indecomposable domain @xmath215 without bad components and @xmath212 .",
    "examples with @xmath208 are drawn in figure [ domain ] .",
    "8    let us stretch one oval in @xmath22 connecting two boundary components .",
    "the result is a domain @xmath216 .",
    "let @xmath88 and @xmath89 be the corners of the bigon , obtained after stretching .",
    "the stretched oval connects @xmath89 to some boundary component , say @xmath53 . by lemma",
    "[ new ] , @xmath89 can also be connected with @xmath53 by a unique path inside @xmath22 .",
    "this path is not affected by the prolongation , since otherwise the domain would not be strongly indecomposable ( compare figure [ notstrong ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath216 can be represented as a union of two domains connecting some generators and having less boundary components .",
    "the unique path connecting @xmath89 with @xmath53 leaves any boundary component along a cut .",
    "moreover , the path has no self  intersections .",
    "therefore , @xmath216 is a union of two strongly indecomposable maslov index one domains without bad components and with positive multiplicities at the corners not bigger than @xmath193 .",
    "these both domains count for the differential by the induction hypothesis .",
    "we conclude that the domain @xmath22 also counts for the differential .",
    "in this section we show how @xmath217 of small knots can be computed by hand and discuss the computer program written by droz .",
    "figure [ newdiag ] shows a rectangular diagram for @xmath74 knot of complexity @xmath218 obtained from the original diagram in figure [ diag ] by cyclic permutations ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "an advantage of this diagram is that there are no regions counted for the differential .",
    "the alexander grading of a generator is given by the formula @xmath219 .",
    "the maximal alexander grading is equal to one .",
    "there are two generators in this grading shown by colored dots in figure [ newdiag ] .",
    "both of them have maslov grading @xmath220 .",
    "the homology of our complex is @xmath221 .",
    "hence in alexander grading zero , we have 12 additional generators coming from the multiplication with @xmath222 .",
    "note that our complex has 15 generators in alexander grading zero .",
    "indeed , 12 of them can be obtained by moving one point of a generator in alexander grading one to the other side of the oval . in three cases , depicted by white dots",
    "there are two possibilities to move a point .",
    "this gives 3 additional generators .",
    "note that these moves drop maslov index by one . to compute @xmath217 in the negative alexander gradings we use the symmetry ( [ sym ] ) .",
    "finally , we derive that @xmath223 has rank two in the alexander ",
    "maslov bigrading @xmath224 , rank three in @xmath225 , and rank two in the bigrading @xmath226 . to compare , the alexander polynomial is @xmath227 . the knot @xmath74 is not fibered and its seifert genus is one .        in @xcite ,",
    "droz extend our construction over @xmath15 and wrote a computer program calculating the homology of the resulting complex @xcite .",
    "the program is installed on the bar ",
    "natan s knot atlas . as a byproduct ,",
    "his program generates rectangular diagrams of knots and links and allows to change them by cromwell ",
    "dynnikov moves .",
    "the program can be used to determine seifert genus and fiberedness of knots until 16 crossings .    according to droz s computations ,",
    "the number of generators in our complex is significantly smaller than that in the mos complex .",
    "moreover , for small knots , almost all domains suitable for the differential are embedded polygons , so they always count for the differential . for example , for knots admitting rectangular diagrams of complexity 10 , the number of generators in the mos complex is @xmath228 .",
    "our complex has on average about @xmath229 generators among them about @xmath230 in the positive alexander gradings .",
    "the knot @xmath231 admits a rectangular diagram of complexity 12 , where @xmath232 .",
    "our complex has @xmath233 generators with @xmath234 of them in the positive alexander gradings .    furthermore , droz s program produced examples of domains counted more than once over @xmath15 .",
    "we do not know similar examples in the analytic setting . in figure 15 one such domain is shown .",
    "this domain has a degenerate system of cuts and its count depends on the order of shortening of ovals .",
