    "the evolution of a neutron star ( ns ) in a binary system differs considerably in the case the donor star is a high mass giant star in a hmxb or is a lighter star in a lmxb ( see _ e.g. _ verbunt 1993 ; lipunov 1992 ) .",
    "it is only in the former case that the formation of a pulsar ( slowly rotating at @xmath7 ms ) in a relativistic ns - ns binary allows for the accurate estimate of the masses of the two components ( portegies , zwart & yungelson 1998 ) . collecting all data for the known binary pulsars , thorsett & chakrabarty ( 1998 ) found an average mass of @xmath3 ( with a very narrow spread @xmath8 ) for both nss in these systems .",
    "these values are fully compatible with the two hypotheses : that nss at birth possess a canonical mass of about @xmath9 ( woosley & weaver 1986 ; but see timmes , woosley & weaver 1996 ) and that the hmxb phase is shortlived so that at most @xmath10 can be accreted onto the oldest nonpulsating ns ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is widely accepted ( phinney & kulkarni 1994 , van den heuvel & rappaport 1992 ) that the formation of millisecond pulsars ( msps ; with period @xmath11ms ) takes place inside lmxbs , where an old neutron star is spun  up by accretion torques .",
    "the mass load can be significant , in these systems , and , in principle , the ns can reach ultrashort periods @xmath12 ms ( depending on the equation of state ) on a time that is controlled by the evolution of the magnetic field ( possenti _ et al .",
    "thus , there is a close relationship between the spin period @xmath13 the gravitational mass and the magnetic field evolution .",
    "cook , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1994a : csta ) developed a relativistic code to study the spin evolution of an unmagnetized ns accreting from the inner edge of a keplerian disk . here",
    "we reproduce their results using a semi  analytical model ( described in section @xmath14 ) .",
    "then we allow for the presence of a magnetosphere around the ns and explore the consequences on the relation between the baryonic mass load @xmath2 and the spin rate @xmath1 , considering two scenarios for the magnetic field evolution .",
    "the minimum mass load requested to reach the submillisecond range is computed for a magnetic neutron star in section @xmath15 , adopting different equations of state ( eoss ) .",
    "observational tests are discussed in section @xmath16 ; in @xmath17 we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we shortly describe the semi  analytical model used to compute the @xmath18vs@xmath19 relation , which is estimated down to limiting periods @xmath20 millisecond .",
    "we first derive a simple equation describing the evolution of the gravitational mass @xmath21 as a function of the baryon load .",
    "we then introduce the set of equations for the evolution of the rotational frequency @xmath22 , including rotational effects on the ns radius during recycling .",
    "the angular momentum transfer rate is computed including the corrections due to a strong gravitational field .",
    "the equations are solved numerically .",
    "the code follows the evolution of an ns of initial gravitational mass @xmath23 which is accreting at a constant rate @xmath24 .",
    "the initial values of the ns baryonic mass @xmath25 and of its radius @xmath26 are known once we specify the eos ( see _ e.g. _ cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994b ; cstb ) . in our model , the gravitational and the baryonic masses @xmath21 and @xmath27 of the ns are related , at any given time , by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ns radius circumferential radius ( _ i.e. _ the proper circumferential length at the ns equator divided by @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 is a constant evaluated using the initial set of parameters .",
    "accordingly , @xmath32\\ ] ] the decrease in radius due to the mass load is described using the simple relation @xmath33 ( for equilibria of degenerate nonrelativistic neutrons ) : with this scaling we estimate the non - rotating ns circumferential radius @xmath29 at any stage of the accretion .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath21 thus reads : @xmath34 \\left[1- \\frac{m_b}{3 m_g } \\left ( \\frac{m_{g,0}}{m_{b,0 } } - 1 \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{m_g}{m_{g,0 } } \\right)^{1/3 } \\right]^{-1 } ~\\dot{m}_b.\\ ] ]    the mass increase is accompanied by the increase in the rotational frequency @xmath22 , and at any time ( i.e. , at any current value of @xmath21 ) we need to determine whether @xmath22 is below or above the mass shedding limit @xmath35 that is the limiting angular frequency at which the gravitational pull is balanced by the centrifugal forces .",
    "@xmath35 is estimated using the classical expression @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the circumferential radius of the rotating ns which in turn depends upon @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath37 is estimated fitting the results of cstb : @xmath38 where @xmath26 is the radius of the static configuration at the current value @xmath21 . in table 1",
    "we compare equation ( 3 ) with the results of cstb , derived using a relativistic code for 13 different eoss ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the agreement is @xmath40 .",
    "the maximum angular speed occurs when the ns equatorial speed reaches the classical keplerian limit computed taking @xmath21 as gravitational mass and as radius @xmath37 : the rapid rotation inflates and deforms the ns surface .",
    "while the non - spherically - symmetric deformations ( oblateness effects ) are important in determining the radius of the spinning ns , they are almost irrelevant in changing the gravitational field felt by a test particle at the ns equator with respect to the corresponding spherical configuration .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that most of the mass is concentrated well inside the external radius , where the deformation effects due to rotation are almost negligible .",
    "this is predicted by the so called roche model ( see _ e.g. _ shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , that , in the hypothesis outlined above , conclude that the maximum expansion of a uniformly rotating star along its equator is a factor of 3/2 , irrespective of the eos adopted .    if @xmath41 , spin up can proceed and the circumferential radius @xmath42 of the rotating ns further increases .",
    "@xmath43 is computed using the relation @xmath44 derived fitting the results of cstb . in fig .  1 we report the values of @xmath43 vs @xmath22 from cstb , for 5 eoss ( @xmath45 and the relation given by equation ( 5 ) .",
    "in the numerical scheme , @xmath35 is firstly determined from ( 3 ) using equation ( 4 ) for @xmath37 .",
    "then ( 5 ) is used to calculate @xmath43 .      during the accretion process the specific angular momentum @xmath46 of the accreting matter",
    "is entirely transferred to the ns . from the angular momentum conservation @xmath47",
    "we obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star . taking into account the inflation of the radius caused by the rapid rotation ,",
    "we extrapolate a result of ravenhall & pethick ( 1994 ) obtained for static stars : @xmath50 the value @xmath51 is significantly altered at high rotational rates .",
    "hence , its derivatives with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath21 can not be neglected in the equation for @xmath52 .",
    "the inner rim of the disk at @xmath53 is at few ns gravitational radii , where relativistic gravity is important .",
    "therefore the specific angular momentum @xmath46 carried by matter differs from the classical newtonian value @xmath54 . assuming an accretion disk co - rotating with the ns , and the kerr metric for the approximate description of gravity around a ns ( see shibata & sasaki 1998 for a more detailed analysis of the metric ) , we obtain from bardeen ( 1972 ) : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    for an unmagnetized neutron star the inner rim @xmath53 of the accretion disk either skims the ns surface or , for very compact ns , is truncated at the radius of the last stable orbit @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the radius @xmath53 is defined as : @xmath59 in the kerr metric @xmath58 is given by : @xmath60^{1/2})\\ ] ] with @xmath61^{1/3 } [ ( 1 + a / r_{h})^{1/3}+(1- a / r_{h})^{1/3}]\\ ] ] @xmath62^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    solving for the differential equations ( 2 ) and ( 6 ) , we determine the ns rotational evolution under the hypothesis of stationary accretion .",
    "our results are in agreement with the results of the relativistic code of csta , within @xmath63 even in the high spin regime ( see _ e.g. _ fig .  2 ) .",
    "the related computational effort is greatly reduced with respect to a fully relativistic numerical approach .      for the case of a magnetized ns",
    ", there is another characteristic length , i.e. , the magnetospheric radius @xmath64 , which has to be compared with @xmath58 and @xmath43 when calculating the value of @xmath53 .",
    "the magnetospheric radius is computed as the product of the alfven radius ( see _ e.g. _ lipunov 1992 ) times a factor @xmath65 , estimated as in burderi _",
    "( 1998 ) . for high enough magnetic moment @xmath66 ,",
    "@xmath64 exceeds both @xmath42 and @xmath58 and the magnetic coupling between the disk and the star determines the extent of angular momentum transfer .",
    "the angular momentum balance relation in this case reads as @xmath67 where the torque function @xmath68 accounts for the details of the interaction between the ns magnetosphere and the accretion disk .",
    "when @xmath69 the ns is on the so  called `` spinup line '' , where it can load mass without modifying its angular momentum @xmath70 . to bracket the uncertainties in the determination of the function @xmath71 , we used two different forms of it , following wang ( 1996 ) and ghosh & lamb ( 1991 ) . in the integration scheme , equation ( 6 ) is modified accordingly , to include the magnetic coupling .",
    "we compute the @xmath1 vs @xmath72 relation for the case of an unmagnetized ns ( as in csta ) considering three selected eoss . as illustrated in fig .  3",
    ", the spin period @xmath1 shows a steep dependence on the mass loading just above @xmath73 ms and small values of @xmath72 ( @xmath74 ) are sufficient to produce a millisecond ns .",
    "by contrast , substantial mass load is requested for spinning the ns below the observed minimum period @xmath75 ms ( psr b1937 + 21 ) . when approaching the limiting period @xmath76 for mass shedding , the relation @xmath18vs@xmath77 flattens .",
    "is @xmath78 as already noted by csta , all eoss ( labeled as in arnett & bowers 1977 ) allow a ns to be spun up to @xmath79 , but a stiffer eos requires a higher value of @xmath72 : @xmath80 for eos l ( stiff ) as compared to @xmath81 for eos a ( soft ) .",
    "we have verified that such figures are only slightly affected by assuming a lower initial gravitational mass for the ns ( e.g. 1.30 @xmath82 - 1.35 @xmath83    in the case of a magnetized ns , the rate at which angular momentum is transferred to the ns is controlled by the interaction of the magnetosphere with the inner boundary of the accretion disk .",
    "thus , the mass load @xmath72 which is necessary to attain a period @xmath1 depends upon the magnitude of the @xmath84-field , on its evolution and on the torque function g(@xmath22 ) .",
    "we describe different evolutionary pathways , during recycling , introducing two characteristic times : the spinup time @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the timescale of decay of the star s magnetic moment @xmath66 .    as a guideline we consider ( i ) a two - steps evolution in which a phase of significant @xmath66-decay ( with @xmath87 ) precedes the phase of spinup at constant @xmath66 ( with @xmath88 ) ; and ( ii ) evolutionary pathways with @xmath89 this condition describes the idealized situation of a ns sliding parallel to the spinup line ( corresponding to a fixed accretion rate ) without braking along it .",
    "in other words , the decay of @xmath66 is tuned just to allow for the ns to approach but never reach the equilibrium period , where the efficiency of the spinup process drops steeply ( wang 1996 , ghosh & lamb 1991 ) .",
    "in fact , at the equilibrium period , the star would accrete matter without increasing its rotational rate .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that the mass necessary to attain a final period @xmath1 in case ( i ) exceeds that of case ( ii ) by a factor 4/3 . for @xmath90",
    "even larger amounts of mass are needed .",
    "thus , case ( ii ) provides a _ lower limit _ on the mass load onto the ns , during the recycling process .",
    "the relativistic corrections at short rotational periods and the details of the disk - magnetosphere interaction prevent a simple analytical study of the spin evolution .",
    "hence , we explored numerically the ns evolution .",
    "4 collects a sample of pathways in the plane @xmath18vs@xmath77 obtained for the equation of state fps ( an intermediate eos ) , combining various initial conditions ( periods in the range @xmath91 sec , @xmath92 between @xmath93 g@xmath94 , accretion rates in the interval @xmath95 @xmath96 ) and selecting decay histories according to models ( i ) and ( ii ) . as illustrated in fig .  4 ,",
    "the values requested to drive a ns to a final period @xmath1 depend on the magnetic field evolution .",
    "we notice however , that only for nss with @xmath97 ms at the end of binary evolution the mass load is sensitive to the history of the @xmath66-field . for a magnetized",
    "ns the demand of accreted matter can at most halve , relative to the value inferred for a unmagnetized ns .",
    "if evolution proceeds to drive @xmath1 below @xmath98 ms , the request of @xmath72 depends weakly on the evolution of @xmath66 since the magnetospheric radius shrinks , becoming comparable to the radius of the last marginally stable orbit or to the physical radius of the star .",
    "therefore , the @xmath18vs@xmath77 relation relaxes to the line that characterizes a unmagnetized ns .",
    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) with @xmath99 ms have not been detected so far .",
    "though such sources are beyond the sensitivity limits of the radio surveys conducted until now , available data may already place constraints on the distribution of msps at periods shorter than @xmath79 . through consideration of surveys sensitivities and",
    "known selection effects , cordes & chernoff ( 1997 ) carried out a likelyhood analysis and found that the best - fit models are those increasing towards short periods with a best - fit minimum period that lies only slightly below @xmath79 .",
    "they in addition found a 95% chance that the fastest msps are slower than 1 ms , and a 1% chance that they are as fast as 0.65 ms .",
    "recently , possenti _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) carried out a population synthesis calculation to determine the fraction of neutron stars with periods shorter than @xmath79 relative to those having @xmath100 , for @xmath101g@xmath102 ( the minimum magnetic moment observed so far ) .",
    "they found that the process of recycling in low mass binaries can lead to a distribution of periods extending below @xmath79 ( for the soft eos a maximum is found to develop about 1 ms ; possenti _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , in preparation ) . if future observations ( as those undergoing at the northern cross in medicina : damico _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) will reveal such pulsars , the underlying nss should have accreted at least @xmath103 .",
    "few estimates of the masses of msps in low mass binaries are now available and are reported in fig .",
    "the data , taken from thorsett & chakrabarty ( 1998 ) , are all compatible with the @xmath18vs@xmath77 relation derived in @xmath15 .",
    "in particular for psr b1855 + 09 , the msp with a mass estimate based on gr alone ( @xmath104 ) , the ( minimum ) mass requested to reach the observed period ( @xmath105 ms ) would be of at most @xmath106 ( for the stiff eos and an initially low value of @xmath66 ) .",
    "thorsett & chakrabarty ( 1998 ) found that data obtained collecting the mass measurements of all the known radio pulsars in binary systems are consistent with a remarkably narrow underlying gaussian mass distribution , with @xmath107 .",
    "their sample of objects contains however five relativistic ns - ns binary systems that contaminates the statistics of msp binaries , narrowing the value of @xmath108 and in turn of @xmath72 .",
    "the progenitors of the ns - ns systems are massive x - ray binaries , a population which does not lead to the formation of fast spinning pulsars .",
    "if the proposed value of @xmath109 is representative of the msps observed sample , this figure is suggestive that a fast decay of the magnetic field has occurred in these systems ( not only in psr b1855 + 09 ) .",
    "this is not in contraddiction with our estimates on @xmath72 because only for those msps recycled to limiting periods @xmath110 the demand of mass load would exceed that of thorsett & chakrabarty .",
    "interestingly , a suggestion of the existence of nss with masses larger than @xmath111 arises also from a recent model ( stella & vietri 1999 ) accounting for the pair khz - qpos observed in many lmxb sources ( see _ e.g. _ van der klis 1998 for a review ) .",
    "stella & vietri interprete the upper qpo frequency @xmath112 as due to matter inhomogeneities orbiting the ns at the inner disk boundary , while the lower qpo frequency @xmath113 is produced by the periastron precession at the inner edge of the accretion disk . in this framework ,",
    "the observed clustering of the differences @xmath114 around 250 - 360 hz is naturally explained provided the gravitational mass of the typical accreting nss is @xmath115 moreover the detection of millisecon x - ray pulsations from sax j1808.4 - 3658 at different luminosity levels of the source suggests the presence of a massive ns in this system as discussed by burderi and king ( 1998 ) .",
    "so far , there is no observational evidence against the existence of submillisecond nss . in the evolutionary scheme adopted ,",
    "the formation of submillisecond nss is a natural outcome if a minimum mass of @xmath116 is accreted and if the magnetic moment decays down to values @xmath117 g@xmath94 _ before _ the end of recycling .    only highly non - conservative scenarios may indeed prevent the transfer of @xmath118 in low - mass binaries .",
    "in fact , evolutionary considerations shows that the mass transfer occurs either because of the nuclear evolution or because angular momentum losses of a @xmath119 companion ( see _ e.g. _ burderi , king & wynn 1996 ; webbink , rappaport & savonije 1983 ) . a more massive companion ( @xmath120 ",
    "if we retain the hypothesis that the ns mass at birth is @xmath121 ) would determine a dynamically unstable mass transfer probably ending into a common envelope phase ( see kalogera & webbink 1996 ; 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , a low mass companion ( @xmath122 ) would either underfill its roche lobe , because its nuclear evolution timescale is longer than the age of the galaxy for initial orbital periods @xmath123 days , or , for shorter initial orbital periods , would fills its roche lobe during its main sequence lifetime , resulting in a near  permanent faint lmxb whose compact object will never appear as a radiopulsar . therefore , in order to produce a fastly rotating ns , we are restricted to a quite narrow range of companion masses , ( namely @xmath124 ) , and of initial orbital periods ( namely @xmath125 days ) . for such binary systems , typical timescales for intense accretion",
    "are @xmath126 years .",
    "once the mass  transfer ceases , the endpoint is often a circular binary containing a millisecond radio pulsar and a low  mass ( @xmath127 ) white dwarf companion , the latter being the degenerate helium core of the sub - giant which transferred mass to the compact object ( see _ e.g. _ burderi , king & wynn 1998 ) .",
    "this implies that the companion has lost @xmath128 during the evolution of the system . even taking into account the case of an highly non - conservative mass transfer phase , it is difficult to believe that the ns in these systems has accreted less than @xmath129 .",
    "\\(a ) slow decay of the magnetic moment would relent the spinup process thus requiring a amount of mass exceedingly large .",
    "in addition , precocious freezing of @xmath66 ( above @xmath130 g @xmath102 ; as discussed in konar & bhattacharya 1997 ; 1998 ) may prevent the formation of very fastly spinning nss .",
    "\\(b ) long term variation of the accretion rate may be important .",
    "the terminal phases of lmxb evolution are still uncertain depending on the roche - lobe feeding mechanisms .",
    "if the accretion rate ceases on a time comparable to the evolutionary time scale , the propeller effect may cause an increase of the spin period above @xmath79 .",
    "approximately , the ratio of the spin down time @xmath131 by propeller to @xmath132 scales as @xmath133 where indexes @xmath134 and @xmath135 refer to spinup and spindown , and @xmath136 is a parameter measuring the efficiency of the extraction of angular momentum from the ns during the propeller phase ( @xmath137 if the efficiency of spin up and down are equal ) . for spindown to be negligible ,",
    "that ratio needs to exceed unity , requiring a rather rapid turn off of the mass transfer rate ( @xmath138 ) ( possenti _ et al . _ in preparation ) .",
    "\\(c ) similar considerations holds in case in which the binary is subject to disk instabilities ( cannizzo 1993 and references therein ) , leading to long periods of low level of activity  referred in literature as quiescence  interrupted by brief periods of outbursts ( van paradijs 1996 , king 1998 ) . for the known soft x - ray transients ( sxts : see campana _",
    "_ 1998 for a complete review ) the first factor in equation ( 13 ) is @xmath139 , whilst the ratio of @xmath66 s stays nearly constant during a cycle .",
    "if the quiescence phase lasts @xmath140 times longer than the outburst phase , spin down would prevail .",
    "the off - on time ratio of observed recurrent transients varies from source to source and is about @xmath141 it is thus difficult to assess the relevance of this process in affecting the spin evolution and the statistical properties of the msp population .",
    "recently li , van den heuvel & wang ( 1998 ) argued that unsteady mass transfer in psr j1455 - 3330 may have occurred , and explored evolutionary tracks allowing for spindown by propeller during the long quiescent intervals that the binary would experience if fed through a thermally unstable keplerian disk .",
    "the discovery of sax j1808 - 3658 might challenge this picture .",
    "\\(d ) for nss with hot interiors , the viscosity of the nuclear matter may become inefficient in damping the recently discovered @xmath142mode instabilities of the star ( andersson 1998 ) . the related emission of gravitational waves ( stergioulas 1998 ) could limit the spin of a ns to a small fraction ( @xmath143 ) of its mass shedding rotational rate . for young nss with @xmath144 ,",
    "this effect could spindown the star at @xmath145 ms in a very short time ( @xmath146 yr ) ( see _ e.g. _ lindblom , owen & morsink 1998 ) .",
    "andersson , kokkotas & stergioulas ( 1998 ) claimed that a similar mechanism could occur during the lmxb - phase , thus preventing the spinup of a ns below @xmath147 .",
    "however , the difficulties in the calculations of the values of the shear and bulk viscosity for superfluid nuclear matter at @xmath148 k ( relevant for the accretion phase ) leave a large uncertainty in the role of this instability in the recycling process .",
