    "cerium intermetallics are rich in exciting phenomena due to various manifestations of the hybridization between a conduction band and 4f electrons ( @xmath3 ) based on the kondo interaction  @xcite . among the most peculiar effects",
    "one may list the formation of heavy fermions , unconventional superconductivity , quantum critical phenomena and non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "microscopic models for heavy fermion ( hf ) systems assume very often that the strength of @xmath3 hybridization is momentum independent  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are theoretical considerations  @xcite indicating a strong momentum dependence of @xmath3 with possible maxima and nodes .",
    "this complex variation of the @xmath3 amplitude is expected to result from the symmetry of f - electrons , which participate in the formation of the kondo singlet .",
    "therefore , the issue of @xmath3 anisotropy deserves more attention in the experimental investigation of f - electron systems .",
    "a typical spectroscopic manifestation of the kondo effect is the abrikosov - suhl resonance also called the kondo resonance ( kr ) which is a narrow high intensity peak in the spectral function located close to the fermi energy ( @xmath4 )  @xcite . in case of ce",
    "based systems angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) was able to determine a k - vector dependent intensity variation of the kr  @xcite .",
    "it was reported that the increased kr intensity is found at normal emission  @xcite or at k - vectors related to bands crossing @xmath4 ( fermi vectors )  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown for cecoin@xmath5  @xcite that the f - electron peak intensity depends considerably on a band crossing @xmath4 , which was interpreted in terms of an anisotropic @xmath3 .",
    "optical spectroscopy  @xcite also reveals anisotropic hybridisation for ce-115 compound .",
    "another effect of the 4f - conduction band hybridization is kr dispersion or more precisely heavy quasiparticle dispersion , which has also been found in ce systems  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a complete image of momentum dependent hybridization strength @xmath3 with the occurrence of eventual nodes predicted by theory  @xcite remains a challenge for an experiment so far .",
    "the object of our investigations , ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 , crystallizes with a derivative of the hexagonal alb@xmath0-type structure with the @xmath6 space group  @xcite .",
    "as established from detailed magnetic susceptibility , electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements of single - crystalline specimens , ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 does not order magnetically down to 0.4 k. its physical behavior at low temperatures is governed by strong _",
    "f_-ligand hybridization , leading to enhanced electronic contribution to the specific heat [ @xmath7 200 mj@xmath8(mol@xmath9k@xmath10 ) at 0.4 k ] and kondo - like temperature variations of the electrical resistivity with the characteristic temperature @xmath11 of about 50 k  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 dependencies are dominated by broad maxima near 80 k , which manifest a crossover from incoherent to coherent kondo regime .",
    "most interestingly , below 10 k , all the bulk characteristics of ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 show non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) features that are compatible with theoretical predictions for griffiths phases .",
    "these should be related to a disorder in ce - si sublattice found recently  @xcite .",
    "so far , pes studies performed on ce@xmath0cosi@xmath13 polycrystals delivered only angle - integrated spectra showing a kr  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present arpes studies of the kondo lattice ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 system .",
    "the spectra consist of dispersions originating from surface and bulk states and a kondo peak related mainly to bulk states .",
    "a specific k - vector dependence of kr indicates that certain bulk bands cross @xmath4 with much higher quasiparticle weight than others .",
    "these results point to a momentum and/or band dependent anisotropic @xmath3 hybridization in ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 .",
    "single crystals of ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 have been grown by the czochralski method and characterized as described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the arpes experiment was conducted at the ape beamline of elettra synchrotron  @xcite with a ses2002 electron spectrometer .",
    "prior to the photoemission studies the crystals were oriented with a laue method .",
    "subsequently , they were cleaved at a pressure of @xmath14 mbar exposing flat surfaces along the ( 10@xmath150 ) crystallographic plane .",
    "the measurements were carried out with linearly polarized radiation , typically at a temperature of 25 k. the energy and wave vector resolution was fixed to 18 mev and 0.01 @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the fermi energy was determined regularly on evaporated gold .",
    "band structure calculations were performed for stoichiometric ce@xmath0cosi@xmath13 using the scalar relativistic version of the full - potential local - orbital ( fplo ) code  @xcite with the perdew - wang  @xcite exchange - correlation potential .",
    "additional correlations within the lsda+u approach were accomplished employing the around - mean - field scheme  @xcite .",
    "an irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone comprised 133 points .",
    "the valence band of ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 was investigated by means of photoemission spectroscopy with the photon energies ( h@xmath17 ) corresponding to lower ( h@xmath17=25 ev ) and higher ( h@xmath17=40 ev ) photoionization cross section for ce 4f electrons  @xcite .",
    "the spectra obtained by integrating arpes data for h@xmath17=40 ev and h@xmath17=25 ev are shown in fig .",
    "1 . usually , one calculates the difference of the spectra corresponding to these energies to approximate a contribution from 4f electrons .",
    "however , in the case of ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 the photoionization cross section for co 3d electrons almost doubles for the excitation energy increase from 25 to 40 ev according to the estimates for free atoms  @xcite .",
    "hence , the contribution from both orbitals , ce 4f and co 3d , is estimated by such a subtraction .",
    "the peaks of the well screened f@xmath18 and f@xmath19 final states ( fig .",
    "1 ) indicate a high hybridization between 4f and conduction band electrons .",
    "the characteristic tail of the kondo peak f@xmath18 is located near @xmath4 and its spin - orbit partner f@xmath19 at 275 mev .",
    "the broad peak at @xmath20 2 ev can not solely be attributed to the weakly screened f@xmath21 final state .",
    "this is because the arpes data ( fig .",
    "2 ) reveal high intensity dispersing peaks near this energy , which can not originate from highly localized and weakly hybridized f - electrons .",
    "thus , a large part of the spectral weight at @xmath20 2 ev should be attributed to co 3d electrons .",
    "density of states ( dos ) obtained theoretically ( not shown ) by means of the fplo method with lsda approach indicate that si 3p , co 3d and ce 4f dominate the valence band .",
    "the contribution from si 3p to the photoemission spectra is less significant due to a very low photoionization cross section at h@xmath17=25 and 40 ev .",

    "the path scanned in the reciprocal space is shown as a green dashed curve inside the three - dimensional ( 3d ) brillouin zone ( bz ) [ fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ] . this curve is part of a large circle in the @xmath24-a - l - m plane , for which the perpendicular to the surface component of the wave vector ( k@xmath25 ) is unknown . for surface states the problem",
    "is reduced to two dimensions and the band structure is scanned along @xmath22-@xmath23 , which is drawn with a green dashed straight line in the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) .",
    "as the considered arpes data do not deliver any information about the real value of k@xmath25 both 2d and 3d bands will be described in the sbz for simplicity .",
    "the measurements were performed with h@xmath17=40 ev at a temperature of 25 k , which is below the coherence temperature estimated to be t@xmath26 80 k. kr and spin - orbit partner are not dispersing but vary in intensity .",
    "the other peaks reveal dispersions .",
    "in particular , @xmath27 and @xmath28 bands ( fig .",
    "2 ) clearly cross @xmath4 .",
    "the electron pocket ( @xmath27 ) observed around the @xmath22 points is more shallow near k@xmath29=0 than at k@xmath30 1.5 @xmath16 .",
    "the locations in the reciprocal space scanned by arpes for k@xmath29=0 and k@xmath29=1.5@xmath16 do not share the same out of plane component of the wave vector - k@xmath25 according to the free electron final state model  @xcite .",
    "hence , 3d states exhibit different dispersions for the equivalent k@xmath29 but different k@xmath25 in neighboring bzs .",
    "therefore , the @xmath27 pocket is considered to be a 3d band of bulk origin .",
    "the @xmath28 band crossing @xmath4 at @xmath22 is well visible at k@xmath30 1.5 @xmath16 in contrast to k@xmath30 0 @xmath16 .",
    "this parabolic band exhibits the same dispersion in both bzs and is therefore regarded as a surface state .",
    "it has the highest spectral intensity of all features in the spectrum , which is expected for surface states at the photon energy of h@xmath17=40 ev .",
    "this is due to the very small mean free path of electrons for this energy  @xcite .",
    "the difference in the intensity at k@xmath30 1.5 @xmath16 and k@xmath30 0 @xmath16 may be attributed to matrix element effects , which favor certain bands with a higher photoemission cross section , depending on the geometry of the experiment , k - vector and probed bz .",
    "this may result in suppression or disappearance of particular bands .",
    "in fact , the @xmath28 band looses intensity when approaching k@xmath29=0 @xmath16 . at this wave vector",
    "the experiment is realized in a pure @xmath31-polarization , which excludes bands with odd parity with respect to the experimental mirror plane . due to this",
    "we can not conclude whether this band crosses @xmath4 near k@xmath29=0 @xmath16 or bends back to higher energies .",
    "cosi@xmath13 by means of fplo with lsda+u approximation for u@xmath32 = 6 ev along ( a ) a standard path connecting high symmetry points and ( b ) for the directions parallel to @xmath24-a .",
    "the high symmetry points are defined in fig 2 ( a ) .",
    "the vertical dashed line denotes k@xmath29=0.6 @xmath16 with the highest kr .",
    "solid ( black ) and dashed ( red ) lines show dispersions corresponding to spin up and down directions respectively . ]",
    "band structure calculations using the fplo method ( fig .",
    "3 ) are helpful for a further interpretation of the arpes results .",
    "theoretical dispersions for bulk ce@xmath0cosi@xmath13 are drawn along a conventional path in the reciprocal space [ fig 3 ( a ) ] and for a set of directions parallel to @xmath24-a [ fig 3 ( b ) ] .",
    "the real path for the arpes studies should be located close to one of the latter directions [ see also fig . 2 ( a ) ] . to consider different strength of correlation the calculations were performed with the ce 4f correlation parameters @xmath33 = 0 ( not shown ) and @xmath33 = 6 ev .",
    "the calculations yield more bands , than observed in the experiment .",
    "a certain number of them can not be seen because of unfavorable matrix elements .",
    "the electron pocket @xmath27 found experimentally near @xmath24 has its counterpart in the calculations for @xmath33 = 6 ev along @xmath24-a and @xmath34-r@xmath35 .",
    "it reaches higher binding energy along @xmath24-a and is a 3d state . on the other hand ,",
    "the exact @xmath28 dispersion is not found in the calculations .",
    "this confirms the surface state origin of this band .",
    "the other bands recorded with a weaker intensity ( fig .",
    "2 ) have corresponding dispersions in the calculations with both @xmath33 = 0 and 6 ev .",
    "the theoretical band structure consists of two components related to opposite spin direction .",
    "this is due to a magnetic ground state predicted by calculations , which is however not found in the experiment .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that in the calculations the total energy difference between magnetic and non - magnetic ground state is so low that even at low temperatures the thermal excitations would destroy long range magnetic order .",
    "moreover , kondo scattering present in ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 should screen magnetic interactions .",
    "arpes data provide a direct evidence of kr intensity variation with k@xmath29 , while its dispersion is not found at t=25 k , a temperature well below the coherence temperature of the kondo lattice , t@xmath37 80k .",
    "energy distribution curves ( edcs ) for exemplary k - vectors from fig .",
    "2 ( b),(c ) are shown in fig .",
    "the height of the kr ( blue arrow ) was estimated with respect to the background located between kr and the spin - orbit splitting peak after proper normalization of the edcs . the",
    "first surprising fact is that the kondo peak intensity is not directly correlated with the fermi wave vectors found in the same experiment . @xmath4",
    "crossings at k@xmath29=0.3 , 1.1 and 1.9  @xmath16 , which are related to the most prominent bulk state , namely the @xmath27 electron pocket , exhibit a relatively low intensity kondo peak . on the other hand ,",
    "the highest intensity kr is found around k@xmath29=0.6 @xmath16 , where bands crossing the fermi energy are not directly observed .",
    "the arpes measurements were performed a few times to exclude the effects of surface quality and kr intensity dependence on k is reproducible .",
    "it is known that the kr may have a much higher intensity than its parent band , which crosses @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the band responsible for the high kr intensity is not visible .",
    "bulk 4f electrons are known for a stronger hybridization with the valence band electrons as compared to surface states  @xcite and they may form a high intensity kr . hence , the large kr should be assigned to a band , which is not seen in the experiment and should be a bulk state .",
    "this experimental material points to the main conclusion of this letter , namely a large variation of the kondo peak intensity along fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "kr is much higher for a weak intensity band at k@xmath29=0.6 @xmath16 than for the well visible @xmath27 pocket .",
    "thus , taking into account band intensities one may conclude that the real kr height variation is even much larger .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the intensity of the kr is lower for k@xmath29=0.9  @xmath16 than for k@xmath29=0.6  @xmath16 , wave vectors that are equivalent in the sbz . due to the circular path of the arpes experiment mentioned before these k@xmath29 vectors correspond to different values of k@xmath25 and thus different locations in the bz .",
    "inequality of kr height in these places is consistent with the 3d nature of the related states .    in order to assign the highest intensity kr to a particular band",
    ", the results of band structure calculations are shown along @xmath24-a , m - l and the paths in between for lsda+u approximation with u@xmath32=6 ev [ fig .",
    "3 ( b ) ] .",
    "the wave vector 0.6 @xmath16 corresponding to the highest kr is highlighted with a dashed line .",
    "actually , an @xmath4 crossing at 0.6 @xmath16 appears for almost all considered paths parallel to @xmath24-a .",
    "it should be stressed that in the case of each considered path there are more e@xmath38 crossings but the highest intensity kr is observed only at the unique wave vector in arpes .",
    "the kr absence may also be explained by unfavorable photoionization cross section for certain bands .",
    "nevertheless , the main thesis is based on the experimental spectra , namely on the comparison of kr height for the @xmath27 band and at k@xmath29=0.6  @xmath16 .",
    "ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 was investigated in the coherent state .",
    "although , the f - state dispersion was not found directly in the experiment , we assume that f - electron related quasiparticles are present .",
    "the high intensity kr peak should refer to a high quasiparticle spectral weight , z(k ) for a given momentum .",
    "its considerable variation along fs indicates also the momentum dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "such a situation was proposed in the theoretical considerations for a ce based cubic system  @xcite .",
    "these predicted strongly anisotropic @xmath3 resulting in a variation of z(k ) along the brillouin zone . in the cited report a high quasiparticle weight ( z(k ) @xmath20 1 )",
    "was found only in very small areas of fs along [ 001 ] and equivalent symmetry directions . according to the predictions",
    ", these regions can be easily missed by arpes due to their very limited size in k - space .",
    "although similar calculations are not realized for ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 our arpes results support the theoretical predictions qualitatively giving the first evidence of strongly anisotropic @xmath3 in ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 system .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the band structure of ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 by means of arpes and fplo calculations with lsda+u approximation . out of a larger number of bands theoretically predicted for bulk ce@xmath0cosi@xmath13 only some can be seen in the experiment .",
    "arpes data reveal a bulk electron pocket near the @xmath24 point ( @xmath27 ) , which is found in the calculations with u@xmath32=6 ev .",
    "the band @xmath28 exhibiting the highest intensity is interpreted as a surface state .",
    "the main contributions from ce 4f electrons to the photoemission spectra are the kondo resonance ( kr ) at @xmath4 associated with the f@xmath18 final state and the peak related to f@xmath19 final state observed at 275 mev .",
    "both peaks are non - dispersing but their intensity varies as a function of the wave vector . in particular , large maximum of kr",
    "is attributed to a specific fermi vector of a bulk band , whereas the other observed bands from the bulk or the surface are characterized with a medium or low quasiparticle weight at fermi vectors .",
    "this represents the arpes evidence of a momentum dependent hybridization between ce 4f and conduction band electrons in ce@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 .",
