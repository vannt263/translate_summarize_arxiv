    "the conventional leading order ( lo ) and next to leading order ( nlo ) charm - anticharm production diagrams at the quark level show little or no asymmetry in the @xmath2 or @xmath9 behaviour of the quark and antiquark , as viewed in the laboratory frame .",
    "previous studies , primarily using pion beams at a variety of energies up to 500 gev/@xmath6 , have shown that in many cases charm mesons that share a quark in common with the beam hadron , so - called _ leading charm _ , are produced more copiously in the forward hemisphere than those states which do not have a shared quark , i.e. , _ non - leading charm _  @xcite . recently ,",
    "this has been extended to charm baryon production by a @xmath5 beam , where asymmetry for @xmath1 compared to @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 was reported to be large  @xcite .",
    "there are limited - statistics proton data available for central production , where only a 90@xmath10 confidence level lower limit is reported  @xcite .    because the quark - level processes are thought to be symmetric , the asymmetries are viewed as features of the hadronization process  @xcite or as a manifestation of an intrinsic charm content of the beam hadron  @xcite . in this experiment the @xmath1 shares a quark in common with all three beam hadrons , while the antibaryon has an antiquark in common with the @xmath4 beam only .",
    "we shall compare the hadroproduction characteristics for these charm baryon and antibaryon states to illuminate the role of the beam fragments in hadronization induced asymmetries .",
    "the selex spectrometer is a three - stage magnetic spectrometer designed to cover charm production in the forward hemisphere .",
    "the beam hadron was identified by a transition radiation detector as pion or not - pion and tracked in 8 beam silicon strip detectors before interacting in a set of 5 target foils , 2 copper and 3 carbon totalling 5@xmath10 of a proton interaction length .",
    "interaction products were tracked in a set of 20 vertex silicon detectors arranged in 4 sets of planes rotated by @xmath11 .",
    "single - track efficiencies for each system exceeded 98@xmath10 .",
    "data were taken with negative beam at 615 gev/@xmath6 ( half @xmath12 , half @xmath13 ) totalling 12.3 @xmath14 inelastic interactions and positive beam at 540 gev/@xmath6 ( 92@xmath10 protons ) totalling 2.8 @xmath14 inelastic interactions .",
    "the layout of the spectrometer can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "+    two proportional wire chamber ( pwc ) magnetic spectrometer systems analyzed tracks with momenta above 3 gev/@xmath6 ( m1 spectrometer , 12 planes ) or 15 gev/@xmath6 ( m2 spectrometer , 14 planes ) .",
    "the beam region of the pwcs was covered with double - sided silicon detectors to give high - resolution momentum measurement up to full beam energy .",
    "the combination of excellent vertex - region tracking resolution ( typically 65 @xmath15rad at 150 gev/@xmath6 ) and excellent momentum resolution ( @xmath16 for a typical 100 gev/@xmath6 track ) gave a @xmath17 mass resolution ( @xmath18 ) of about 9 mev/@xmath19 at all @xmath2 .",
    "tracks above 22 gev/@xmath6 traversed a ring - imaging herenkov ( rich ) and were identified as @xmath12 , k , or p  @xcite .",
    "the rich distinguished @xmath20 from @xmath21 up to 165 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "the proton identification efficiency was greater than 95 @xmath10 above proton threshold ( @xmath22 90 gev/@xmath6 ) and greater than 90 @xmath10 above kaon threshold ( @xmath22 45 gev/@xmath6 ) .",
    "an important innovation in selex was the use of an online topological trigger to identify charm .",
    "the hardware trigger was loose , requiring @xmath23 charged hadrons in the forward 150 mrad cone and @xmath24 hits from positive track candidates in a hodoscope after m2 .",
    "about 1/3 of all inelastic interactions satisfied this trigger .",
    "the software trigger made a full vertex reconstruction of the beam track and all tracks in the m2 spectrometer ( high momentum tracks ) to test that hypothesis that they all came from a single primary vertex .",
    "a software - adjustable @xmath25 cut of 8.5 selected candidate events that were inconsistent with a single primary vertex , i.e. , events that _ might _ have a downstream decay .",
    "this gave a rejection factor of about 8 in the data volume .",
    "studies with the software trigger turned off show that this costs about a factor of 2 in charm efficiency , for a net filter enhancement of 4 .",
    "a general data reduction pass found reconstructable charged tracks and identified the interacting beam track .",
    "primary and secondary vertices were found by geometric reconstruction without regard to particle identification .",
    "the high resolution of the beam and vertex systems , along with the thin production targets , gave typical primary vertex resolution of 270 @xmath15 m and secondary vertex resolution for these @xmath1 events of 560 @xmath15 m for a mean @xmath1 momentum of 230 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "all the @xmath26 candidates used in this analysis were selected by the following requirements : ( 1 ) primary and secondary vertex fits each had @xmath25/dof @xmath27 5 ; ( 2 ) the primary - secondary vertex separation significance ( l/@xmath18 ) had to be greater than 8 , where @xmath18 is the quadrature sum of the primary and secondary vertex errors ; ( 3 ) the total momentum vector of the decay tracks had to point back to the primary vertex within errors ; ( 4 ) ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 events were required to have positive rich identification for the ( anti)proton and the ( @xmath28)@xmath29 . the pion could be any track ; ( 5 ) secondary vertices which occured inside any target were removed ; ( 6 ) each secondary track was extrapolated back to the primary vertex to determine its transverse miss distance .",
    "the second - largest transverse miss distance had to exceed 20 @xmath15 m .",
    "events were selected by the above cuts and sorted by the primary beam tag : @xmath5 or @xmath4 from the negative beam and protons from the positive beam .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows the full selex statistics for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 mass plots where signals for all beams are combined .",
    "gaussian fits are shown for illustration only .",
    "the background shapes are smooth on the low mass and high mass side of the signal regions .",
    "the signal yield for bayons and antibaryons are determined by a sideband subtraction method which assumes a linear mass resolution dependence for the momentum spectrum .",
    "the number of background events estimated outside the signal window is subtracted from the number of events in the signal window .",
    "the signal window corresponds to a 3.33-@xmath18 mass width and the background is 10-@xmath18 centered at 2.285 gev/@xmath19 .",
    "we find @xmath32 signal events for @xmath1 and @xmath33 signal events for @xmath0",
    "the data yields were corrected in each @xmath2 bin by the total acceptance ( geometrical acceptance and reconstruction efficiency ) .",
    "the simulation used monte carlo generated @xmath1 ( or c.c . ) events with phase space decay to the @xmath26 final state .",
    "the simulated trajectories were converted to hits in all tracking detectors , including multiple coulomb scattering but not secondary interaction losses .",
    "the hits were embedded in the hit banks of real data and all tracks were reconstructed .",
    "this overestimates slightly the tracking inefficiency , but this effect is small . the rich simulation has been tested against a set of @xmath34 events taken without a rich cut .",
    "agreement is excellent ; the proton identification efficiency averaged over the momentum spectrum is 95@xmath10 .",
    "the simulated events were analysed with the same tracking and reconstruction procedure used in the data .",
    "the whole set of cuts used to extract the signal was applied here as well .",
    "the acceptance is the ratio between the number of events reconstructed by the number of embedded events generated .",
    "selex acceptance does not depend on the transverse momentum of the charm particle up to @xmath35 ( gev/@xmath6)@xmath36 .",
    "therefore we consider only the acceptance as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "an important issue for this analysis is the relative efficiency for the baryon and antibaryon decays . as seen in figure  [ fig : accep ] , there is no discernable difference in the acceptances . the @xmath2 distribution of the acceptance - corrected number of events from each beam is shown in figure  [ fig : xf ] .",
    "because the beam flux is the same for baryon and antibaryon , these figures compare the relative production cross sections for these states .",
    "the curves shown are fits of the standard parametrization @xmath37 to the data .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab xf ] .",
    ".summary of measured n - value from the fit @xmath37 for @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the errors are statistical only . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the relative sizes of the differential cross sections for baryon and anti - baryon production are clearly different for pion and baryon beams .",
    "the pion beam valence quark content is baryon / antibaryon symmetric .",
    "relative cross sections for @xmath1 and @xmath0 production from pions are comparable in shape and magnitude over the entire @xmath2 range .",
    "such behaviour is consistent with the leading particle picture , since both charm states share a valence quark in common with the beam . for @xmath5 and proton beams @xmath1",
    "production is much stronger than @xmath0 production , especially at high @xmath2 . in this case",
    "there are no valence antiquarks , and antibaryon production appears to be strongly disfavored .",
    "the four distributions that show leading behaviour are consistent with a common @xmath37 dependence having n @xmath38 2.5 , much harder than the n for leading meson production from pion beams  @xcite .",
    "note that the high - statistics @xmath5 distribution shows some interesting structures .",
    "clearly @xmath1 production is favored over @xmath0 , and the enhancement increases with @xmath2 .    the @xmath3 spectrum for @xmath1 production by the three different beam hadrons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pts ] . for @xmath39 2 ( gev/@xmath6)@xmath36 all three beams are consistent with a smooth exponential spectrum @xmath40 with the same parameter b @xmath22 1.1 ( gev/@xmath6)@xmath41 . at larger @xmath3 values ,",
    "seen only in the high - statistics @xmath5 data , the exponential gives way to a power - law behavior as expected in qcd and as seen in @xmath42 production  @xcite .",
    "there is no indication in the large-@xmath2 events of an enhancement at small @xmath3 as suggested by the intrinsic charm picture .",
    "however , when we look at the @xmath2 behaviour of events after the slope change at @xmath43 2 ( gev/@xmath6)@xmath36 , we see a significant difference in the @xmath2 behaviour .",
    "the events with large @xmath3 have a softer @xmath2 spectrum than those at small @xmath3 , as seen in figure  [ fig : xf ] ( d ) .    the hadroproduction asymmetry a is defined as : @xmath44    where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is the production cross - section for the charm particle ( anti - charm particle ) in study .",
    "we calculated the values of the asymmetry and the errors using the maximum likelihood method with no limit at @xmath47 .",
    "events in each @xmath2 bin follow the poisson distribution . therefore , the likelihood function is a product between two poisson distributions , one for the background region and the other for the signal region .",
    "the results are presented for the three beam hadrons in figure  [ fig : asy ] .",
    "as is already clear from the @xmath2 distributions , @xmath8 production in @xmath5 and proton beams shows a strong asymmetry favoring baryons over antibaryons at all @xmath2 .",
    "the proton asymmetry rises sharply toward unity already at small @xmath2 , reflective of the paucity of @xmath0 production by protons .",
    "the @xmath5 asymmetry has a smoother approach to the limit at @xmath48 . in the case of the @xmath4 beam",
    "we see only a slightly positive and constant asymmetry throughout the @xmath2 range .",
    "our result agrees well in the overlap region with recent e791 data  @xcite .",
    "systematic errors in kinematic analysis may arise from several sources .",
    "we list here the ones that have been considered . in all cases",
    "systematic effects are found to be small compared to statistical errors .    * @xmath2 binning effects + the @xmath2 distribution is relatively smooth , but there are structures in the high statistics data .",
    "we have shifted the bin limits for all @xmath2 distributions by 0.025 ( half a bin ) and refit the data .",
    "no effect in the character of the distributions is observed .",
    "for example , all the structures seen in fig.3(c ) are also present in the shifted distribution .",
    "changes in the n - value are consistent with purely - statistical effects .",
    "therefore , we quote a conservative @xmath49n for the fit of 0.1 , even though no systematic effect has been seen . + * mass window size + the signal window in the mass distribution is taken as @xmath5030 mev/@xmath19 around 2.285 gev/@xmath19 .",
    "we have changed the window up to @xmath5035 mev/@xmath19 and down to @xmath5025 mev/@xmath19 .",
    "the systematic error for changing the mass window compared to statistical error is negligible .",
    "* acceptance corretion + the acceptance shown in fig .",
    "2 is computed using the method of adding hits from simulated charm decay tracks into the data banks from an observed event .",
    "the modified event is reanalysed to see if the charm state is reconstructed",
    ". there could be a shift in the corrected @xmath2 distribution if the acceptance calculation does not represent truly the @xmath2 variation of the apparatus efficiency . in e781 the dominant efficiency variation at low @xmath2",
    "is purely geometric : both proton and kaon pass through the fiducial volume of the rich counter .",
    "a second geometric effect is the related one : the charm particle live long enough to pass the vertex significance cut .",
    "the tracking characteristics of the spectrometer match those predicted from the simulation very well over all momenta studied here .",
    "the @xmath51 mass is the same for all observed momenta , both in data and simulation .",
    "we believe that there is no systematic bias from the simulation and assign no error .",
    "* trigger bias in asymmetry + the @xmath2-dependent effects tend to cancel in the asymmetry measurement .",
    "however , a new systematic effect must be considered : trigger bias .",
    "the e781 trigger required counts on the postive - bend side of a trigger hodoscope after the second bending magnet .",
    "this _ might _ favor @xmath1 production over @xmath52 .",
    "we looked at the asymmetry of @xmath51 production , for times when the @xmath53 is found in the high - momentum spectrometer compare to the converse .",
    "we see a maximum 3% asymmetry .",
    "we also look at the charm baryon data itself .",
    "if we @xmath54 the charm tracks , then in 97% of the triggers there are still enough hits in the hodoscope to trigger the event without the charm decay tracks .",
    "we conservatively assign a 3% systematic error to the asymmetry from trigger bias .",
    "the selex experiment reconstructed about 2500 @xmath55 from 600 gev/@xmath6 @xmath5 and @xmath4 beams and a 540 gev/@xmath6 proton beam .",
    "we observed that the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath1 production is similar for all three beams , much stiffer than for meson production .",
    "both baryon beams show a strong enhancement of the production of charm baryons over antibaryons , while the two are produced comparably from a pion beam .",
    "these results are in general agreement with color - drag models of hadronization .",
    "the differences in behaviour for protons and @xmath5 illustrate significant non - perturbative effects in production dynamics at these energies .",
