    "in the epoch between redshifts 1 and 2 , the universe was in a period of rampant star formation , agn phenomena were 1000 times more common than at the present time , and there were many powerful , massive quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "there are many questions about the behavior and evolution of these dynamic objects and processes during these `` bright ages '' .",
    "what fraction of these objects are in clusters or active mergers ? how does the agn affect star formation in its local environment ? do radio synchrotron jets quench or trigger star formation ?    in order to provide a large database for studies aimed at addressing all of these questions , we have used the wfc3 instrument to obtain multiband optical and ir images of a set of 1@xmath22.5 radio galaxies and qsos in the 3cr catalog @xcite .",
    "the 3cr catalog is unbiased with respect to orientation effects and contains the most powerful radio sources at any given redshift , allowing us a view of the behaviors of the progenitors of some of the most massive , dominant cluster elliptical galaxies . from these data",
    ", we can begin to address many of the fundamental questions of galaxy and cluster behavior at this exciting time in the universe s history , including details of star formation rates and cluster environments and the prevalence of mergers .",
    "here we present our calibrated data , along with qualitative descriptions of the features in the observations , as well as initial photometric and emission line analyses of the objects .    combined with data from previous snapshots of 3c objects at lower redshifts ( e.g. @xcite",
    ") we can look for evolutionary trends over long timescales , including agn and host galaxy interaction from z.17ex2 to today .",
    "scientific results from these data are presented in a series of papers e.g. @xcite , kotyla et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) , and chaiberge et al .",
    "( 2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "we used wfc3 on board hst to obtain visible and near - ir images of our 3c targets under snapshot proposal 13023 .",
    "these data were collected between december of 2012 and may 2013 .",
    "the sample definition is the revised 3c catalog as defined by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the 3cr catalog includes all radio sources with flux density at 178mhz @xmath3jy that are located at a latitude @xmath4 . from these",
    ", we restricted our proposed target list to the 58 sources with @xmath5 .",
    "over the course of cycle 20 , we obtained data for 22 of these objects , representing 38% of our proposed sample .",
    "of these 22 objects , 12 are high - excitation narrow line radio galaxies ( rgs ) and 10 are qsos .",
    "observed targets are listed in table [ tab : objinfo ] along with some of their basic properties .",
    "these objects cover a range in redshift from 1.055 to 1.825 , with the exception of 3c 257 at @xmath6 .",
    "the average completion rate for hst / wfc3 snapshot programs is currently ( cycle 20 - 21 ) @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is most likely due to the stsci policy that lowers the scheduling priority of targets belonging to programs that reach the @xmath8 completion rate limit . as a result",
    ", our program was efficiently scheduled in the first part of the hst cycle 20 .",
    "unfortunately , as soon as we reached the @xmath8 limit , the observations stopped , and no other targets were scheduled after june 2013 .",
    "our total of 22 observed objects represents a rather small fraction of the complete catalog of sources .",
    "this is particularly significant for statistical work , for example to firmly establish the fraction of objects that show specific properties and to derive important information on the nature of these radio sources .",
    "the stsci procedure for selecting a subset of sources from a snapshot proposal should not result in any bias in terms of source properties .",
    "nevertheless , it is very important to test that the observed sample is representative of the entire population of objects belonging to the 3cr . in fig .",
    "[ histo ] we show the distribution of total radio power at 178mhz ( left panel ) and redshift ( right panel ) for the whole 3cr sample with @xmath9 ( in red ) and for our observed sub - sample ( in yellow ) .",
    "visually , the yellow and red histograms appear to be similar .",
    "in fact , the kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that we can not reject the null hypothesis that the observed and the full sample follow the same redshift and radio power distributions .",
    "the p - values are @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the radio power and redshift distributions , respectively .",
    "the statistical test is performed using the @xmath12 function _",
    "ks.boot _ included in the _ matching _ package @xcite .",
    "this function performs a bootstrap version of the k - s test that is useful when statistical ties are present in the samples , as it is in our case .",
    "however , an identical result is returned by the classical ks test ( _ ks.test_ ) .",
    "while this analysis does not prove that the observed and original distributions are the same , it provides support to the idea that our sample of 22 objects is a good representation of the original 3cr catalog at @xmath9 .",
    "however , note that with only 22 observed objects the statistical accuracy is significantly reduced ( by a factor of @xmath13 , assuming the binomial statistics and depending on the resulting object fraction ) compared to the original sample .",
    "for example , if we observed that 70% of our objects display a specific property ( e.g. the source is a member of a cluster of galaxies , the source is associated with a host galaxy brighter than a certain magnitude , etc . ) , we would not not be able to statistically establish whether our sample is different from any ( larger ) comparison sample that shows only 50% of objects associated with clusters .",
    "instead , this would be possible if at least 77% of the full sample was observed . a higher level of statistical accuracy is clearly very important for a number of tasks , e.g. testing unification scenarios , comparing radio - loud and radio - quiet agns , establishing differences between inactive and active galaxies , etc .      table [ tab : objinfo ] lists details of the hst data that have been collected for this analysis .",
    "we imaged each object with both the uvis and ir channels of wfc3 , through the filters which cover the highest dqe spectral regions of those channels .",
    "see the wfc3 instrument handbook @xcite for more technical details on the two channels within wfc3 .",
    "uvis observations were made using the f606w filter , which has a pivot wavelength of 588.7 nm and a width of 218.2 nm .",
    "the field of view in the uvis channel is 162 `` x 162 '' at a resolution of 0.04 `` per pixel . for each object , we collected 2 images with equal exposure times and a 2.4 '' pointing offset between one another , in order to enable cosmic ray rejection and to cover the 1.2 \" gap between the two uvis ccds . for qso targets",
    ", we also collected a 30-second image , which will be used to facilitate psf subtraction .",
    "this work will be described in a future paper .",
    "the ir channel observing strategy was similar .",
    "two observations of each object were made through the f140w filter ( pivot wavelength 1392.2 nm , width 384 nm ) .",
    "these observations covered a 123 `` x 136 '' field of view , at a resolution of 0.13 `` per pixel .",
    "for each observation , we used the spars50 sample sequence with 11 non - destructive detector readouts , translating into an exposure time of 249 seconds .",
    "we also imposed a  1.25 '' dither between the two ir channel observations of each object .",

    "in this section , we focus on the data reduction strategies and techniques we use to produce the highest - quality visible and near - ir images for each object . we customize the data reduction and image combination process , rather than using the drizzled images produced by the standard hst pipeline and available in the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) .",
    "our calibrated and drizzled data are available at http://hz3c.stsci.edu , and will also be ingested into mast as high level science products ( hlsp ) available for download at http://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/index.html .    for both the uvis and ir channel data ,",
    "we begin our custom data reduction routine with with the _ flt _ files output by the standard _",
    "calwf3 _ data reduction pipeline .",
    "the pipeline performs basic calibration steps on the raw data , including bias and dark current subtraction , linearity correction , flat fielding , and bad pixel masking . additionally , for ir data _",
    "calwf3 _ identifies and removes cosmic ray effects .",
    "it also fits a line to the multiple signal values for each pixel , and outputs the pixel s signal rate in the _ flt _ file . for more details on the calibration steps performed by _ calwf3 _",
    ", see the wfc3 data handbook @xcite .",
    "we also check to be sure that _",
    "calwf3 _ is run with the best available reference files for our data .",
    "beginning with the _ calwf3_-output _ flt _ images , we first correct charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) effects in the files by running them through the cte correction algorithm @xcite .",
    "this correction models the details of how charge traps in the uvis detector grab and release charge during the readout process . from this",
    ", the correction script is able to identify charge which was caught in charge traps during the detector readout , and return it to the proper pixels .",
    "this greatly reduces the magnitude of the cte - induced charge trails in the original _ flt _ images .",
    "the resulting data are saved in _",
    "flc _ files .",
    "after the cte correction is performed we are able to focus on cosmic ray rejection .",
    "astrodrizzle , which is part of the drizzlepac software package @xcite , allows for identification and removal cosmic rays from wfc3 data , as well as the removal of the geometric distortion from the images .",
    "it also then combines the individual images into a final , clean image .",
    "astrodrizzle eliminates cosmic rays by placing multiple images of the same section of sky onto the same pixel grid and then comparing the measured signals in each pixel through the stack of observations .",
    "if , for a given pixel , one image in the stack shows an anomalous signal compared to the mean of all the signals , astrodrizzle will flag the anomalous signal as a cosmic ray hit .    however , with our data composed of only two dithered images per object , we only have two measures of the signal at any given point on the sky .",
    "any location impacted by a cosmic ray in one image therefore leaves us with one good measure of the signal for that point on the sky , along with one bad measurement .",
    "in this situation , astrodrizzle has no knowledge of which of the two measures is good and which is bad .",
    "the traditional way to deal with this situation when combining images with astrodrizzle is simply to assume that the lower of the two values is the uncontaminated signal , and to use that value in the final combined image .",
    "this limits the accuracy of the counts measured in the resulting combined image .    instead , we attempt to recover some of the sky values in cr - contaminated pixels prior to combining images with astrodrizzle .",
    "we use the python version of la cosmic @xcite , cosmics.py , to identify and remove cosmic rays in our images .",
    "la cosmic identifies cosmic rays by using a variation of laplacian edge detection , and can distinguish between cosmic rays and undersampled psfs . for more details , see @xcite . while this method is effective at locating cosmic rays within the data , we note that it replaces the signal values in the cosmic ray - impacted pixels with extrapolated counts from the surrounding pixels .",
    "it therefore introduces larger uncertainties in the recovered pixels compared to the use of a method such as astrodrizzle for cosmic ray correction .",
    "we run la cosmic on each individual _ flc _ file , using a set of conservative parameters to ensure that no signal is mistakenly removed from the astronomical sources .",
    "these parameters include a sigclip value of 5 , sigfrac of 0.85 , and objlim of 5 .",
    "this run of la cosmic ( hereafter run 1 ) identifies the most obvious cosmic rays in each image , and replaces each impacted pixel with the median value of the surrounding good pixels .",
    "we then run la cosmic a second time ( run 2 ) on the original _ flc _ file using more stringent parameters : sigclip value of 4.5 , sigfrac of 0.65 , and objlim of 2 .",
    "the motivation for this is to improve the data quality in the areas of sky covered by the inter - chip gap in each of the original input images .",
    "the width of the inter - chip gap is approximately 1.2@xmath14 , while the dither between our two observations is roughly twice as large . with the inter - chip gap falling on a different area of the sky in each of the two exposures , when combining the images we create two 1.2@xmath14 wide strips where the sky was only imaged once .",
    "any cosmic rays impacting within these strips leave us with no uncontaminated measurements of the signal in that location .",
    "we extract these regions from the clean _ flc _ obtained after run 2 and insert them in the appropriate position of the _ flc _ file obtained after run 1 . correcting a significant fraction of the cosmic ray population with la cosmic then allows astrodrizzle to use 2 measures of the signal during image combination for many of the cosmic ray - impacted pixels .",
    "after these initial cosmic ray correction steps , we use astrodrizzle to remove residual cosmic rays and geometric distortion , to align , and combine the two individual images for each object into a final image .",
    "final images were rotated into a north - up and east - left orientation .",
    "even after the previous cosmic ray correction steps , some residual cosmic rays in the drizzled images are still present .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that two dither - points are not always sufficient to provide a fully clean image .",
    "this happens for two reasons : i ) if two cosmic rays cover the same area of sky in both images , and ii ) for particularly bright cosmic rays , the rejection algorithm in astrodrizzle may not work perfectly , for reasons that are not completely understood but that most likely depend on the specific settings of that task and on the image noise level .",
    "we remove these residual cosmic rays using a custom procedure .",
    "first , we make a mask that includes pixels showing significant flux excess compared to the surrounding pixels .",
    "these are identified by a simple algorithm that compares each drizzled image with both the difference and the ratio of the original two images .",
    "the marked pixels in the mask are then grown using a gaussian kernel of appropriate fwhm ( generally @xmath15 pixel ) , in order to fix a slightly larger area .",
    "this is important because these residual cosmic rays appear much more smoothed in the drizzled image than in the original flt files , and while the brightest pixels are easily identified with this procedure , the adjacent fainter external pixels might not be correctly removed .",
    "the data reduction process for the ir channel data is relatively simpler than that for the uvis data , due to the fact that the multiple non - destructive detector readouts within each observation allowed for easy cosmic ray identification and removal within the _ calwf3 _ data reduction pipeline .",
    "the first effect we deal with is persistence .",
    "this is an after - image observed in pixels which in previous exposures were subjected to high flux levels .",
    "see @xcite for more details on persistence .",
    "our goal is to remove any persistence signal present in our data , in order to avoid contaminating later photometry .",
    "we begin by retrieving the persistence masks and persistence - corrected _ flt _ files of our observations from mast .",
    "these files have had the persistence signal modeled and subtracted from them , following the model described in section 8.3 of version 4.0 of the wfc3 data handbook @xcite , and are therefore different from the standard _ flt _",
    "files available in the archive .",
    "examination of these persistence masks reveals that for most objects there is no appreciable persistence contamination from prior observations .",
    "however , in some cases we do fall victim to self - persistence , where the bright sources in our initial exposure induced persistence in the following image . while the 1.25@xmath14 ( approximately 10-pixel ) dither between observations is large enough that self - persistence from the central object",
    "is shifted outside of the object in the second image , there are cases where the shift results in this persistence signal appearing close to surrounding objects of interest .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ persist ] , where the panel on the left shows signal due to self - persistence inside the red circles .",
    "in the panel on the right , the persistence has been removed using the persistence model .    after careful examination of",
    "the persistence - corrected _ flt _ files from mast , we chose to use these files for our subsequent analyses .",
    "the next step in our data reduction is to remove the geometric distortion from all of the _ flt _ files , and to combine the two images for each object into a final ir image .",
    "we use astrodrizzle to accomplish both of these steps .",
    "we then use tweakreg ( also part of the drizzlepac software package ) to align this final image to the same world coordinate system present in the corresponding uvis - channel drizzled image .    at this point",
    "it is possible to overlay the uvis and ir image for a particular object and compare the morphology and brightness in the two observation bands .",
    "photometric analysis of the objects in our images is performed using sextractor @xcite .",
    "our strategy is to use the ir images for object identification and aperture definition .",
    "the resulting catalogs are then used for the photometry on both the ir and uvis images .",
    "the motivation for this strategy lies in the fact that our uvis data , which have an effective wavelength of roughly 6000  , are capturing uv rest frame photons for our targets at @xmath16 .",
    "these data are therefore biased towards showing irregularly shaped star forming regions rather than the entire galaxies , whose rest frame optical emission has been shifted into the wavelength range covered by our ir data .",
    "this means that many sources present in the ir data appear at a very low signal level , not at all , or with a significantly different morphology in the uvis data .",
    "this renders the uvis images unsuitable for aperture definition .",
    "for example , the left panel of fig [ fig:3c324_zoom ] shows that 3c 324 appears as an extended source stretching primarily east - west .",
    "however the corresponding uvis image , seen in the right panel , reveals appreciable signal only in several distinct star forming regions within the host galaxy .    by basing the aperture used in the uvis image on that defined within the ir image",
    ", we are sure to measure the total uvis signal associated with 3c 324 , rather than having sextractor erroneously treat each star forming region as a separate object .",
    "we therefore perform our photometry in two steps . first ,",
    "using sextractor in mag_best mode , we obtain measurements of each target s flux in the ir data . in this mode",
    ", sextractor determines the best elliptical aperture to use , and measures the flux inside that aperture . as an ancillary output , we have sextractor calculate @xmath17 , the radius of a circle which would encompass 90% of the target s light .",
    "we then use @xmath17 as the basis of the uvis photometry for the target . testing on real and simulated sources of varying morphologies",
    "reveals that using a circular aperture which is 20% larger than @xmath17 results in the full recovery of all of the object s flux in the uvis image .",
    "the photometry results are then corrected for galactic absorption and converted into ab magnitudes using the zeropoints provided by the wfc3 team .",
    "table [ tab : abmags ] lists the resulting ab magnitudes and uncertainties for all of our targets .",
    "note that in this paper we focus only on the results for our target 3cr sources rather than all of the objects in each image .",

    "@xcite measures an absorbing column density of @xmath34 for 3c 68.1 .",

    "conversely , as a group the qso targets appear to become more red as their brightness increases .",

    "however , even if reddening affects the flux measured in f606w more significantly than that in f140w , we would still expect to see a correlation between reddening and f140w magnitude ( i.e. the redder the source , the fainter ) . unless the brighter qsos in the cmd are intrinsically brighter at a level sufficient to counter the obscuration effect in f140w , we do not believe that the presence of reddening is the correct interpretation .",

    "there is also faint signal in the optical image associated with two of the more extended surrounding objects , as well as the compact object located between and equidistant from the two main sources .",
    "this is clearly a merging system , with active star formation occurring in at least some of the sources connecting the two main galaxies @xcite .",
    "the corresponding radio map shows two compact radio sources aligned with both of the bright ir components . in addition",
    "there are two lobes , roughly 30 @xmath14 to the north and 15 @xmath14 to the south of the bright ir components .",
    "the lobes are well aligned with the two main ir image sources .",

    "the northern lobe is significantly brighter than the southern lobe .",
    "in addition , there are 4 distinct objects within about 3.5@xmath14 of the target .",
    "the optical image shows essentially no emission from any of these objects , despite a calculated star formation rate of @xmath40 per year @xcite .",
    "this may imply that dust obscuration in this object is substantial .",
    "the radio maps associated with the target show compact radio sources that are well aligned with the bright cores in the ir image .",
    "this qso appears in our ir image as a bright compact object .",
    "there are only two other sources within 8@xmath14 of the target .",
    "these are both smaller , dimmer sources 3.75@xmath14 and 5.5@xmath14 to the east .",
    "neither of these extra sources is visible in the corresponding optical image .",
    "the radio map of the area shows emission in the core of the quasar , as well as two lobes roughly 10@xmath14 to the north and 15 @xmath14 to the south .",
    "our photometry show that 3c 68.1 is significantly redder than all of our other qso targets .",
    "this is most likely due a combination of a high inclination and a dusty environment .",
    "this allows dust - reddened light from the nucleus as well as reddened scattered light to contribute to the overall observed signal . @xcite",
    "the target , a well - studied css source @xcite appears in our ir image in an overdense region which is most likely a cluster of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy is clearly visible as a roughly elliptical area of diffuse emission extending to the northeast and southwest .",
    "a blob of relatively bright emission , about 1@xmath14 in size , has its center located roughly 2@xmath14 northeast of the target .",
    "our optical image reveals a well - defined area of signal in the same area , suggesting active star formation .",
    "very few of the galaxies surrounding the target have appreciable signal in the optical image , supporting the assertion that they are cluster members at the redshift of the qso .",
    "radio data show emission coincident with the core of the qso , as well as a jet extending from the qso to the northwest for roughly 2@xmath14 .",

    "there are 5 sources to the south and one to the northwest , all within 6@xmath14 .",
    "there is little to no signal from these sources in our optical image .",
    "radio data show signal centered on the qso , as well as two lobes to the northeast and southwest .",
    "there is evidence of a hot spot in the southwestern lobe .",
    "the peak of the radio signal in the hot spot is coincident with an area visible in our optical image .",
    "our ir image of 3c 268.4 reveals a bright qso with a handful of small , dim sources , within about 12@xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the nearest neighbor to the target is a relatively bright , compact object roughly 2.5@xmath14 to the south . in our optical image ,",
    "this nearest neighbor is resolved into a clumpy mass with significant signal , suggesting active star formation .",
    "many of the other nearby dim sources also exhibit some flux in the optical .",
    "finally , the optical image also contains an oblong source located only 0.8@xmath14 to the southwest of the target , suggesting a possible merger . if there is corresponding flux from this object in our ir image , it is not visible due to its close proximity to the target and the large pixel size in the ir channel .",
    "radio emission is also visible coming from this adjacent oblong source .",
    "the qso itself shows significant signal in the radio .",
    "there are also two radio lobes , roughly 3@xmath14 to the northeast and southwest .",
    "3c 270.1 appears as a bright unresolved source surrounded by many dimmer sources of various morphologies .",
    "there are at least 5 sources within 4@xmath14 of the target . of these ,",
    "only one is detected in our optical image .",
    "most of the sources in the region surrounding the object are very red .",
    "the radio morphology is not symmetric with respect to the center of the qso .",

    "no jet is visible on the northern side of the core .",
    "the radio morphology is reminiscent of that of wide angle tailed ( wat ) sources @xcite , which typically inhabit clusters of galaxies .",
    "our ir image of 3c 287 reveals the bright qso with bright compact neighbor 4@xmath14 to the southwest .",
    "in addition , four sources of varying brightnesses are present along a line separating the target from the bright neighboring source . of these 4 sources ,",
    "2 show some signal in our optical image . the associated radio signal is limited to a compact core on the optical core of the qso .      in our ir image",
    ", 3c 298 appears as a bright , asymmetrical source with more signal to the east appearing in a conical shape reminiscent of the narrow line region seen in 3c 230 .",
    "in addition , there is a small area of increased flux 2.5@xmath14 to the southeast of the galaxy center in our ir image .",
    "this area is elongated and points radially away from the center of the qso .",
    "in the optical image , with its better resolution , this small source appears as three knots of emission .",
    "these sources could be regions of intense star formation at the edge of the nlr .",
    "radio emission is visible in the core of the qso , as well as two small areas 0.5@xmath14 and 1.5@xmath14 to the east ; probably a knotty jet and a hot spot .",
    "the jet and hot spot appear roughly in the center of the conical area of emission in the ir and optical images .",
    "note that the jet is at a different orientation than the three knots of optical emission to the southeast of the qso .",
    "the qso 3c 418 appears in our ir image as a bright target located within a dense field of objects .",
    "in addition to the main qso , there appears to be a distinct source located 1.5@xmath14 to the southwest , as well as a small and a larger extended source 3@xmath14 and 6@xmath14 to the northwest , respectively . to the east",
    ", there is also a pair of extended sources approximately 8@xmath14 from the target . while 3c 418 appears in our optical image as a compact source , only the source 3@xmath14 to the northwest shows any signal in the optical image .",
    "radio emission is concentrated in the core of the qso , with a small jet extending approximately 6@xmath14 to the northwest .",
    "3c 432 appears in our ir data as an unresolved source within a field of objects .",
    "there is some dim extended emission , potentially a narrow line region , to the northwest of the qso .",
    "there are also several distinct sources in the same direction as the extended emission , within 7.5@xmath14 of the qso .",
    "in addition a small source is located 2@xmath14 to the northeast , and two extended sources are 4.9@xmath14 to the south of the target .    in our optical image , 3c 432 appears as a compact , isolated source .",
    "none of the nearby sources described above show optical signal .",
    "radio emission is present in the core of the qso , as well as in two lobes roughly 6 - 8@xmath14 to the northwest and southeast .",
    "these lobes are aligned with the potential nlr - emission seen in our ir image .",
    "we have presented qualitative descriptions along with photometric analyses of new wfc3 visible and near - ir observations of a set of 22 1@xmath412.5 radio galaxies and qsos from the 3cr catalog .",
    "in addition , archival radio data have been combined with the hst observations in order to provide a more complete picture of the targets and their local environments .",
    "emission line analysis indicates that the contamination from emission line signal is limited for both the qsos and the radio galaxies .",
    "we find contamination rates of less than 2.6% from each of the lines for which we have direct flux measurements .",
    "however , we do not estimate contributions from the potentially bright h@xmath20 and [ oiii ] lines in the rest frame optical data .    for most of our radio galaxies ,",
    "we see the alignment effect , where the lobes in the radio data are colinear with the major axis of the galaxy in the visible / ir image .",
    "however , emission line contamination means that for most sources , we are unable to distinguish between alignment with the optical continuum versus alignment with the emission line gas .",
    "we see two rgs ( 3c 322 and 3c 356 ) with compact nuclei coincident ( to within wcs uncertainties ) with the radio core .",
    "extended narrow line regions appear visible in 2 rgs ( 3c 230 and 3c 305.1 ) and 5 qsos ( 3c 186 , 3c 268.4 , 3c 270.1 , 3c 298 , and 3c 432 ) .",
