    "the minimum mass solar nebula ( hereafter mmsn ) is the protoplanetary disk of solar composition that has the amount of metals necessary to build the eight planets of the solar system ( and the asteroid belts ) . from the masses and compositions of the planets , a density of solids",
    "is derived at several locations of the disk .",
    "then , the solar composition is restored by adding gas , and a smooth protoplanetary disk density profile is derived . for a review of past works on the mmsn concept , see the introduction of @xcite .",
    "the most famous version of the mmsn was provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "assuming that the giant planets have a rocky - icy core of about 15 earth masses , and that jupiter accreted all the solid material available between 1.55 and 7  au , hayashi finds a surface density profile of @xmath0 , similar to the one given by @xcite .",
    "of course , the density profile obtained depends crucially on the position of the planets .",
    "hayashi assumed that the planets formed where they presently orbit .",
    "a recent model explains several features of the solar system ( the late heavy bombardment , the orbital distribution of the trojans of jupiter , the orbital elements of the giant planets  ) thanks to a late global instability in the outer solar system dynamics @xcite . in this so - called `` nice model '' ,",
    "the four giant planets were in a compact configuration just after the solar nebula dissipation .",
    "therefore , if one assumes that this model is true , the @xcite and @xcite nebula is out of date . in a recent , very nice article",
    ", @xcite constructed a new mmsn , assuming that the planets were formed in the disk at their starting position in the nice model .",
    "he finds that the density distribution required to form the giant planets in this configuration , including the presence of an exterior disk of planetesimals , can be very well fitted by a steep power law density profile .",
    "in addition , he studies the time evolution of this disk .",
    "he finds a solution of a decretion disk , that can survive with an almost unchanged density profile in the giant planets region for a few million years .",
    "this enables the solid cores of the four giants to reach their isolation masses , and then to slowly accrete their gaseous envelope .",
    "consequently , this nebula is self consistent from the planetary formation point of view .",
    "the nice agreement between the initial position of the planets in the nice model and a long - lived , almost power - law protoplanetary disk can be seen as a new plus point for the nice model .",
    "however , planets in gaseous disks are subject to planetary migration ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . how to prevent jupiter ( and saturn ) from becoming a hot jupiter ( or saturn )",
    "is a longstanding problem in solar system formation , but some solutions have been proposed . @xcite",
    "have shown that a mean motion resonance between jupiter and saturn can enable them to resist the driving inwards by the disk , and to migrate together outwards .",
    "@xcite found disk parameters for which jupiter and saturn enter the 3:2 mean motion resonance and then have a negligible migration .",
    "@xcite then showed that uranus and neptune can also be saved in that case , by capture in resonance with saturn .",
    "the four giant planets are in the end of the gas disk phase in a compact , fully resonant configuration .",
    "two of these possible final configurations can lead to a late global instability of the dynamics , as required in the nice model .",
    "these works were based on a disk in which the density slope was low and the gas density at the location of jupiter was of the order of the one in the @xcite nebula .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of the planetary migration in the @xcite nebula . in section  [ sec :",
    "disk ] , we describe our code , that enables a simulation of the entire disk , and of its global evolution .",
    "we also review the disk properties , and show how they should affect the planetary migration .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : isoth ] for a locally isothermal disk , and in section  [ sec : energ ] for a disk where the energy equation is taken into account . in every case , the planets are lost into the sun . in section  [ sec : mmr ] , we try to reproduce the @xcite result in the @xcite disk , or in a colder disk with same density profile . in section",
    "[ sub : un ] , we focus on original results on uranus and neptune in some simulations . for comparison , the migration in the @xcite mmsn in presented in section  [ sec : hayashi ] . some numerical issues are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclu ] , and some prospectives are suggested . we show how planetary migration should be considered in the construction of a minimum mass solar nebula , and we draw some ideas towards a mmsn compatible with both planetary migration and the nice model .",
    "we use the code fargo @xcite , in its 2d1d version @xcite . in this version ,",
    "the classical 2d polar grid of the hydro - code ( in which the planet - disk interactions are computed ) is surrounded by a 1d grid . in the 1d grid ,",
    "the disk is considered as axisymmetric , and only the radial component of the equations is computed ; this is computationally very cheap , therefore the 1d grid extension can be very large .",
    "the two grids are smoothly connected , so that the disk evolution is computed accurately over all the 1d grid extension : the evolution of the inner and outer parts of the disk computed in the 1d grid , influence the disk evolution in the 2d grid ; and reciprocally the planet - disk interactions computed in the 2d grid perturb the global disk evolution .",
    "this property of the code makes it the perfect tool to study the behavior of the giant planets in the mmsn . indeed ,",
    "giant planets generally open gaps in the disk , and then are locked in the global viscous evolution of the disk ( type  ii migration ) .",
    "most often , this drives the planets inwards .",
    "but in the desch nebula , the disk is viscously spreading .",
    "consequently , its global evolution should drive planets in type  ii migration outwards .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite found that things are not that simple .",
    "if the gap is not completely empty , a corotation torque is exerted on the planet , gas can pass from the inner to the outer disk ( or reciprocally ) , and the planet can decouple from the disk evolution .",
    "type  ii migration can then proceed inwards in a decretion disk , or outwards in a viscous accreting disk .",
    "this can be seen only with the use of the 2d1d algorithm , that permits both an accurate 2d computation of the planet - disk interaction and the 1d computation of the global disk evolution .",
    "the global disk evolution also matters for the type  iii regime .",
    "the outer edge of the 1d grid is located at @xmath1  au from the star , as prescribed by @xcite .",
    "the inner edge is located arbitrarily at @xmath2  au .",
    "the inner and outer edges of the 1d grid are open , allowing gas to flow out of the grid .",
    "the rings of the grid are logarithmically distributed : @xmath3 is constant through the two grids .",
    "the cells of the 2d grid are squared : @xmath4 .",
    "the 2d grid extends from @xmath5 or @xmath6 to @xmath7  au , covering the planets region .    in the computation of the force of the disk on the planets , a part of their hill sphere",
    "is excluded . to perform this ,",
    "we calculate in the code the vector force @xmath8 using the following expression : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , @xmath11 the mass of the planet , @xmath12 is the surface of the considered cell , @xmath13 is the vector from the planet to the center of the cell , @xmath14 is its length , and @xmath15 is the smoothed distance to the planet .",
    "the smoothing length @xmath16 is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hill radius of the planet .",
    "the term @xmath19 is our filter used to exclude the neighborhood of the planet given by : @xmath20^{-1}\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] it is a smooth increasing function from 0 at @xmath21 to @xmath5 when @xmath22 , through @xmath23 when @xmath24 , @xmath25 when @xmath26 , and @xmath27 when @xmath28 ( see figure  2 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the solar nebula found by @xcite has the following properties . assuming that jupiter formed at @xmath29  au , saturn at @xmath30  au , uranus at @xmath31  au and neptune at @xmath32  au",
    ", the gas density should be : @xmath33",
    "@xmath34    this is about 10 times more dense than the @xcite nebula at 5  au , and 6.4 times more dense at 10  au , and 3 times more dense at 30  au .",
    "the steep density slope makes the disk a decretion disk , viscously spreading outwards , fed by the internal parts . the steady state profile found by @xcite",
    "has a slightly different shape , but we use the power law for convenience .",
    "the two profiles are almost identical in the giant planets region .",
    "the outer edge of the disk is found to be located at @xmath1  au from the star .",
    "the temperature is @xmath35 , which corresponds to an aspect ratio of @xmath36 the viscosity is given by an @xmath37 prescription @xcite , with @xmath38 .    with these characteristics ,",
    "the disk profile remains almost unchanged for nearly 10 millions years , which leaves time for the solid cores of the planets to reach their isolation masses and accrete their atmosphere .",
    "however , this also leaves the planets time to migrate .    in our simulations ,",
    "the planets are initially located on circular orbits at the position from which the @xcite disk is derived ( see above ) .",
    "the planets masses are grown smoothly from 0 to their present masses over @xmath39 years at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the planets are not accreting gas from the disk .    during the first 100 orbits of jupiter ( 1274 years )",
    ", the planets do not feel the disk potential , and therefore do nt migrate . during this time , the planets launch a wake , open a gap , perturb the disk .",
    "this is for the disk to adapt to the planets potential and reach an equilibrium state .",
    "then , the planets are released under the influence of the disk , and start their migration .",
    "the aspect ratio is @xmath40 at the location of jupiter , and @xmath41 at the location of saturn .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath42 is @xmath43 at the location of jupiter , and @xmath44 at the location of saturn . denoting @xmath45",
    ", we find @xmath46 for jupiter , and @xmath47 for saturn .",
    "the unified criterion to open a gap of depth @xmath48 of the unperturbed density is @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect jupiter to open a non - empty gap , and saturn not to perturb the density profile significantly .",
    "consequently the mechanism used by @xcite to prevent jupiter and saturn migration should not work : it requires that the two planets lie in a wide common gap in mean motion resonance . on the contrary",
    ", saturn should be here in type  i migration , like uranus and neptune .",
    "given that these three planets are massive ( @xmath50 to almost @xmath51 earth masses ) , and that the disk density is high , their type  i migration should be fast .",
    "the isothermal horseshoe drag exerts on the planet a torque proportional to the logarithmic gradient of the vortensity : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the second oort constant @xcite . in keplerian rotation ,",
    "thus , in the @xcite nebula , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . due to the steep negative slope of the density profile ,",
    "the corotation torque is negative , while it is zero if @xmath57 and positive if the slope is shallower .",
    "such a disk density slope should therefore enhance the type  i inwards migration of the planets with respect to more classical disks , in particular the @xcite mmsn .    the high mass of the disk and the fact that jupiter opens a small gap , makes it likely that jupiter falls in the type  iii , runaway migration regime @xcite .",
    "indeed , the mass of gas present in the coorbital region of jupiter in the unperturbed disk is about 4 times the mass of jupiter ; therefore , the coorbital mass deficit may exceed the mass of the planet , which is the condition for the runaway migration .    in summary , in the nebula found by @xcite",
    ", the four giant planets of the solar system should migrate inwards on a short timescale . to check this , and to study the possible interactions between the four planets in the nebula ,",
    "we have performed numerical simulations , presented in the next sections .",
    "in this subsection , we use a locally isothermal equation of state @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the sound speed .",
    "the sound speed is a function of the distance to the star given by @xmath60 , which is not evolving with time .",
    "the energy equation is not computed .",
    "the 2d grid ranges between @xmath6 and @xmath7  au , with a resolution of @xmath61 , so that it is divided in 270 rings , and 628 sectors .",
    "the planets are set according to section  [ subsec : disk - pl ] .",
    "the migration path obtained is displayed in figure  [ fig : isoth_lowres ] .",
    "as soon as released , jupiter enters a type  iii migration regime and reaches @xmath62  au in @xmath63 years .",
    "there , it stops due to interaction with the boundary of the 2d grid .",
    "if the grid had extended further inwards , there is no reason why jupiter would not have reached the sun .",
    "saturn also migrates inwards , at first in type  i migration because it hardly perturbs the density profile .",
    "it enters the type  iii migration regime only at @xmath64 years .",
    "indeed , at this time , saturn has reached @xmath65  au , where @xmath66 .",
    "then , the dip dug by saturn in the disk profile is deeper than before , the _ coorbital mass deficit _ can reach the mass of saturn , and the runaway process can start .",
    "when saturn reaches @xmath67  au , at @xmath68 years , it is caught in the 5:3 mean motion resonance with jupiter : for 300 years , the ratio between their semi major axes is @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 denote the semi major axis , and the subscript refers to the name of the planet ) .",
    "this breaks the runaway . at @xmath71 years",
    ", saturn has a close encounter with jupiter and is kicked out .",
    "then , it starts again an inwards migration until it is blocked again by jupiter : from @xmath72 on , the ratio between their semi major axes is almost constant @xmath73 .",
    "this may be due to a mean motion resonance or to indirect interactions , jupiter perturbing the disk and thus the motion of saturn ; in particular , the corotation torque should be positive and strong on the outer edge of the gap of jupiter , which repels saturn ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the two planets then start to migrate slightly outwards in a common gap , like in @xcite .",
    "neptune and uranus are in the type  i migration regime . between @xmath74 and @xmath75 years",
    ", neptune is slowed down by saturn : the ratio of the semi - major axis of the two planets remains constant equal to @xmath76 during this period . between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , uranus",
    "is also slowed down , with @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "this shows likely captures of neptune in the 5:4 resonance with saturn , and uranus in the 5:3 with saturn or the 4:3 with neptune .",
    "however , a mean motion resonance can not be maintained if the involved bodies move away from each other .",
    "when saturn accelerates its inwards migration , neptune and uranus stay behind .    once saturn has moved inward ,",
    "the two ice giants accelerate again their inwards migration .",
    "neptune goes faster and reaches an other resonance with saturn . from @xmath81 years on , their semi - major axis ratio is constant equal to @xmath82 .    at time",
    "@xmath83 years , uranus reaches neptune .",
    "the two planets then share the same average semi - major axis , equal to @xmath84 , which is characteristic of a 3:2 mean motion resonance with saturn .",
    "their configuration will be analyzed in more detail in section  [ sub : un ] .",
    "because some authors @xcite have found that type  iii migration is resolution dependent , we have performed the same experiments with a better resolution of @xmath85 .",
    "the 2d - grid is also extended inwards and ranges now from @xmath86  au to @xmath87  au .",
    "the 2d grid is now divided in @xmath88 rings and @xmath89 sectors .",
    "the 1d grid is divided in @xmath90 rings between @xmath2 and @xmath1  au .",
    "the result is displayed in figure  [ fig : isoth_bw ] .",
    "it is very similar to the previous case .",
    "jupiter still migrates in type  iii migration as soon as released , and saturn also undergoes a runaway migration episode , but a few hundreds of years earlier than before .",
    "the planets go further inwards due to the extended 2d grid ; this shows that their stop is a numerical artifact , as expected .",
    "the global result is not affected by the resolution .",
    "in fact , figures  [ fig : isoth_lowres ] and [ fig : isoth_bw ] look similar , and the same explanations hold .    from @xmath91 years on , saturn and jupiter migrate slightly outwards in the 5:3 mean motion resonance , with @xmath69 .",
    "neptune and uranus have the same migration rate in both resolution cases , before @xmath92 years .",
    "after @xmath92 years , they migrate faster in the high resolution case because saturn is not present anymore to slow them down . at @xmath93",
    ", a close encounter happens between uranus and neptune ( the distance between the two planets is smaller than 0.4 au ) .",
    "then , the two planets share the same semi major axis again",
    ". more detail on their configuration will be provided in section  [ sub : un ] .",
    "after @xmath94 years , the four planets have escaped a fall into the sun , thanks to the inner edge of the 2d grid .",
    "they have reached a fully resonant configuration in which their inwards migration is prevented .",
    "this is roughly similar to @xcite .",
    "however , here the four giant planets lie within 7  au from the sun , with jupiter being at @xmath95  au .",
    "this is incompatible with the present structure of the main asteroid belt .",
    "in addition , the last planet is not stopped by a resonance with saturn or with the last but one planet , so that the two ice giants share the same orbit .",
    "this is because the disk is more massive here than in @xcite , and the gaseous torques are stronger than the more distant resonances .",
    "it is very unlikely that this final configuration may lead to a late global instability that would drive the planets on their present orbits .      in the previous simulations ,",
    "the migration of jupiter was stopped because the giant planet reached the inner edge of the 2d grid .",
    "consequently , what happens after this event is admittedly interesting , but somehow artificial . in a new simulation",
    ", the planets are removed when they reach @xmath96  au .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ fig : isoth_bw_apu ] for the higher of two resolutions used above ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "jupiter being not present anymore , saturn goes on migrating inwards and finally reaches @xmath98  au as well .",
    "then , uranus and neptune migrate inwards freely .",
    "the differential lindblad torque , responsible for type  i migration , is proportional to @xmath99 ; thus it increases as @xmath100 when the planets approach the sun .",
    "this explains their accelerating migration . within @xmath101 years , they have migrated inwards all the way to the grid edge too .",
    "the same happens at lower resolution .    with this more realistic way of dealing with the planets at the inner edge of the 2d grid ,",
    "the four giant planets are lost in less than @xmath94 years .",
    "it has been shown recently that computing the energy equation can change dramatically the corotation torque , and thus the migration rate of low mass planets @xcite .",
    "planets in type  ii migration should not be perturbed much , but this process may be critical for neptune mass planets @xcite . in the case considered in this paper , we expect this effect to be also significant for saturn and jupiter because their gap is not empty . to check this , we have implemented in fargo-2d1d the computation of the energy equation as done in the fargo - adsg version .",
    "the energy equation is the following , with @xmath102 the surface density of internal energy of the gas , @xmath103 the velocity vector , and @xmath104 the pressure : @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are heating and cooling terms , respectively .",
    "the heating term comes from the viscous heating .",
    "the cooling term is given by a vertical black body emission : @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath110 is the temperature , and @xmath111 is the opacity . the opacity is chosen such that the temperature profile given by @xcite is an equilibrium profile of the unperturbed disk ( in which @xmath112 ) : @xmath113 with @xmath114 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h / r_0 ] ) .",
    "the cooling time @xmath115 is then @xmath116 , @xmath117 . for uranus and neptune ,",
    "the horseshoe libration time @xmath118 is @xmath119 at 12  au , with @xmath120 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 3 ) ) .",
    "the cooling time being large with respect to the libration time , the thermal effect on the corotation torque should saturate quickly and the migration of the ice giants should not proceed outwards like in @xcite .",
    "our equation of state is , with @xmath121 the adiabatic index ( @xmath122 ) : @xmath123 now , the sound speed @xmath59 is not fixed but determined at every time - step by the local temperature , which is evolving with time .",
    "the same experiments as in previous section are computed , with this energy equation and equation of state .",
    "the result at lower resolution is shown in figure  [ fig:2_lowres ] .",
    "jupiter and saturn still undergo a type  iii migration episode . the migration of uranus and neptune is slower than with a locally isothermal disk , but is still directed inwards . in the end",
    ", the situation is basically unchanged with respect to previous section : jupiter is blocked by the edge of the 2d grid , saturn is blocked by jupiter , uranus and neptune share a common orbit in resonance with saturn .    with a higher resolution ( @xmath124 ) , and removing the planets",
    "when they reach the inner edge of the 2d grid , one gets the migration paths displayed in figure  [ fig:2_highres_apu ] .",
    "jupiter and saturn disappear below @xmath125  au within @xmath126 years .",
    "the migration of uranus and neptune is a bit slower than in the previous case .",
    "however , as soon as saturn starts its type  iii inwards migration , the migration of the ice giants accelerates .",
    "then the migration of neptune is similar to the previous case ( with a 800 years delay ) , while that of uranus is much slower ( @xmath127 au.year@xmath128 ) .",
    "after @xmath129 years , neptune reaches @xmath130  au and is declared lost .",
    "uranus goes on migrating slowly inwards , accelerates after neptune is suppressed , and reaches @xmath125  au after @xmath131 years .",
    "previous sections have shown that if the 4 giant planet of the solar system are placed in the @xcite nebula in the starting configuration of the nice model and released simultaneously , they migrate inwards and disappear in the sun in about @xmath132 years . in this section , we try to prevent this by releasing the planets in sequence , and varying the disk aspect ratio .",
    "we aim at reproducing the best candidate mechanism so far to prevent the inwards migration of jupiter and saturn : @xcite and @xcite have shown that when jupiter and saturn orbit in a mean motion resonance in a common gap , they can avoid type  ii migration or even migrate outwards .    therefore , we have performed simulations in which jupiter is held on a fixed circular orbit longer than saturn and the ice giants .",
    "the three lighter planets migrate inwards .",
    "once saturn s semi major axis has reached a constant value in terms of jupiter semi major axis ( which betrays a resonance ) , we release jupiter as well . immediately , jupiter migrates inwards in type  iii migration and disappears ; and the three other planets migrate inwards again .",
    "this is because the considered disk is too thick to enable jupiter to open a deep and wide gap , embracing also saturn .",
    "so , we decrease the aspect ratio to @xmath133 .",
    "as the viscosity is given by an @xmath37-prescription , the viscosity is also smaller .",
    "in fact , @xmath134 .",
    "the planets are maintained on a fixed orbit for 5250 years ( 500 jupiter orbits ) . at this time",
    ", jupiter has opened a deep and wide gap , the density at the bottom of which is a bit less than @xmath135 of the unperturbed density .",
    "saturn has opened a partial gap , of depth a half of the unperturbed density , and the two gaps have merged ( see the solid profile in figure  [ fig : profile_ar0.04 ] , compared to the dot - dashed initial profile ) .",
    "this kind of gap suits the @xcite mechanism : jupiter and saturn lie together between the inner and the outer disk .",
    "first , only saturn is released .",
    "one expects than saturn , repelled by the outer disk , would migrate inwards until it encounters a mean motion resonance with jupiter .",
    "however , saturn goes immediately in type iii migration outwards and reaches @xmath136  au .",
    "twenty orbits later , jupiter , uranus and neptune are released as well .",
    "jupiter runs away inwards and reaches @xmath62  au in about a hundred years .",
    "if the 4 planets are released simultaneously after 500 orbits of jupiter , the same thing happens .    in an other attempt ,",
    "uranus and neptune are not considered , and the aspect ratio is set constant equal to @xmath137 , like in the almost stationary solution found by @xcite .",
    "saturn is placed on a circular orbit at @xmath136  au , and let free to migrate after 2550 years ( 200 jupiter orbits ) , while jupiter is still held on a fixed orbit at @xmath29  au .",
    "saturn migrates inwards in type  iii migration , and then is blocked by jupiter .",
    "then , we release jupiter as well after 5100 years ( 400 jupiter orbits ) . again , jupiter runs in type  iii migration into the sun as soon as released .",
    "decreasing even more the viscosity and aspect ratio of the disk may help , but @xmath133 and @xmath138 are already rather small compared to the standard values inferred from observations . in fact , there are two reasons why the @xcite mechanism can not work in the considered disk , even if one assumes that it is cool enough to enable jupiter to open a wide gap :    1 .",
    "the density of this disk is so high that jupiter ( or saturn ) can easily enter the runaway type  iii migration regime . in that case , jupiter is driven inwards faster than saturn , and the putative resonance is broken .",
    "2 .   this disk is a decretion disk .",
    "the @xcite mechanism prevents a pair of planets from inwards type  ii migration .",
    "it works when the innermost planet is more massive than the outer one , and repels the later outwards against the accreting outer disk . here",
    ", the global evolution of the disk is directed outwards .",
    "a more massive saturn than jupiter would be needed to prevent the outwards type  ii migration of the two planets .      in the above simulations , when the migration of jupiter is artificially stopped at the edge of the 2d grid",
    ", uranus and neptune always end on the same orbit , captured in the same mean motion resonance with saturn .",
    "this strange configuration is worth a more detailed analysis .    in the first case presented ( locally isothermal disk , with resolution @xmath139 ) , the distance between the two planets shown as crosses in figure  [ fig : un] is bounded by @xmath23  au after @xmath140 years .",
    "the hill radius of the planets is @xmath141  au at @xmath142  au .",
    "this indicates a satellite motion of the planets .",
    "this kind of configuration requires a lot of damping because the planets were of course unbound gravitationally at the beginning .",
    "the damping is here provided by the disk , and is visible between @xmath83 and @xmath143 years in figure  [ fig : un ] : the maximum distance between the planets decreases until it becomes smaller than the hill radius .",
    "the high density of this nebula makes such a satellite capture possible .    in the second case ( locally isothermal , @xmath144 ) , the planets are not satellites of each other . here , the distance between uranus and neptune is slightly oscillating around @xmath62  au after @xmath143 years .",
    "they share the same orbit , with an eccentricity smaller than @xmath145 and uranus leading about @xmath146 before neptune : the angle between uranus and neptune , seen from the sun , is plotted as crosses in figure  [ fig : isoth_bw ] , with respect to the right @xmath147-axis .",
    "the two planets are not at a lagrange point of the other one",
    ". this unusual configuration may be due to the mean motion resonance with saturn , or more probably to the strong dissipation by the disk , that modifies the local dynamics .",
    "once the disk will have evaporated , these two planets should have a tadpole motion around one of their @xmath148 lagrange points .",
    "such a configuration have already been studied , for instance by @xcite .",
    "generally , it is assumed that a giant planet captures a migrating terrestrial planet , that may then grow .",
    "in contrast , here the effect of the giant planet is to put two 15 earth mass planets together on the same orbit .",
    "this is a new way of forming trojan planets .    in the third case",
    "( with energy equation , and @xmath149 ) , the distance between the two ice giants ( shown as the @xmath150 symbols in figure  [ fig:2_lowres ] ) settles to about 2 times their semi - major axis .",
    "this indicates that the two planets are in opposition , librating around their @xmath151 point . once again",
    ", this configuration is not possible in the absence of gas dissipation or of the other planets , because the @xmath151 point is unstable . if the other planets and the disk disappear , these two planets should have coorbital horseshoe orbits .",
    "these three original outcomes open new possibilities for extra - solar systems .",
    "they do not fit the solar system configuration , though . whether or not a scenario like",
    "the nice model may apply from such 1:1 resonances , is not clear .",
    "in particular , the configurations with uranus and neptune at opposition or at 30 degrees on the same orbit are probably unstable on the short term in absence of the gas disk .",
    "this is thus unlikely to yield to a _ late _ instability , as required . in the case where the two planets are satellite of each other at a distance @xmath152  au , the energy required to separate them , @xmath153 , is roughly equivalent to the energy required to eject a moon size body out of the solar system from a 10 au orbit . therefore , it is likely that they stay in this satellite configuration",
    "for comparison , the same experiment as in section  [ sec : isoth ] has been performed in the standard minimum mass solar nebula .",
    "the initial density is the one quoted in introduction , that is : @xmath154 this profile appears in figure  [ fig : profile_ar0.04 ] as the straight , gray , dotted line .",
    "the equation of state is locally isothermal .",
    "the aspect ratio is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h / r_0 ] ) , and the viscosity is given by an @xmath37-prescription with @xmath138 .",
    "the planets are initially placed on circular orbits at their present position : @xmath155  au , @xmath156  au , @xmath157  au , @xmath158  au .",
    "the resolution is @xmath159 , the 2d grid extends radially from @xmath160 to @xmath161  au , while the 1d grid covers the range @xmath162 $ ]  au .",
    "the planets do not feel the disk potential during 400 jupiter orbits ( 4740 years ) , and are then released .",
    "the evolution of the semi major axes of jupiter and saturn are displayed in figure  [ fig : hayashi_d ] . in spite of the fact that the shape of the gaps opened by the planets are similar to the ones in the @xcite disc ( the width and depth depend only on @xmath11 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 ,",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no type  iii migration take place , because this disc is not massive enough .",
    "saturn migrates faster than jupiter ; about 2600 years after the release , the two planets enter in 2:1 mean motion resonance , which slows saturn down .",
    "after @xmath165 years , the migration stops at @xmath166 , @xmath167  au .    in an other , longer term simulation",
    ", we change the aspect ratio to @xmath168 and the viscosity to @xmath169 .",
    "the low aspect ratio enables jupiter to open a significant gap , and saturn a shallow one . the density profile after 400 jupiter orbits can be seen as the bottom , gray , dashed line in figure  [ fig : profile_ar0.04 ] .",
    "the migration paths are displayed in figure  [ fig : hayashi ] for @xmath170 years .",
    "jupiter migrates inwards in type  ii migration , while saturn migrates faster .",
    "after 6400 years , saturn encounters the 2:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter , but is not caught in it . at about @xmath94 years , saturn encounters the 5:3 mean motion resonance with jupiter ; from this time on , @xmath171 .",
    "the gaps of the two planets merge .",
    "then , the @xcite mechanism takes place , and the two planets have very little migration , like in @xcite : their semi major axes do nt change by more than 1  au in @xmath172  years .    note that the stop of the migration of jupiter at @xmath173 ( or @xmath174 )",
    "au is not due to the edge of the 2d grid : the radius of the inner edge of the 2d grid is about a half of the semi major axis of jupiter .",
    "the presence of saturn is responsible for the salvation of jupiter . to check this ,",
    "the same simulation has been performed with jupiter alone , without the other three planets .",
    "the migration path is displayed in figure  [ fig : hayashi ] as the orange dashed line . in this case",
    ", jupiter has an unperturbed type  ii migration , and reaches 3 au in @xmath175 years , @xmath176 au in @xmath177 years .    for comparison , the migration path of jupiter in figure  [ fig:2_highres_apu ]",
    "is displayed also in figure  [ fig : hayashi ] as a dotted red line .",
    "it looks like a free fall towards the sun .",
    "uranus and neptune are migrating inwards in type  i migration .",
    "their migration speed is slower than in the previous cases , because the density is moderate and the density slope is such that the isothermal corotation torque is zero . when approaching saturn , uranus slows down and almost stops between 9 and 10 au .",
    "then , neptune is caught in the 2:3 mean motion resonance with uranus at @xmath178 years : from this date on , their semi - major axis ratio is @xmath179 .",
    "migration also occurs in the @xcite nebula , and it is not possible that the giant planets stay where they form until the present time .",
    "therefore , the @xcite nebula is not more consistent with planetary migration than the @xcite one .",
    "however , no runaway migration takes place , and the jupiter - saturn pair can avoid migration all the way to the sun for some reasonable disk parameters .",
    "then , a scenario like the one presented in @xcite is possible . in this article , the authors find 6 fully resonant configurations of the four giant planets in which the migration is prevented .",
    "after disk dissipation , two of these configurations can lead to a late global instability of the planetary system , compatible with the nice model .",
    "to slow down migration in the @xcite nebula , one can think of taking the energy equation into account with an other opacity law . this would change the thermal structure of the disk . with a shorter cooling time ,",
    "the temperature and the aspect ratio decrease .",
    "this has basically two effects : ( i ) saturn and jupiter would open a deeper gap , but our locally isothermal simulations with @xmath180 show that it may not be enough to prevent their migration ; ( ii ) the thermal horseshoe effect would not saturate if @xmath181 , which could lead to a positive corotation torque on the planets , particularly uranus and neptune .",
    "this should be the subject of a future , dedicated study .",
    "however , it is rather unlikely that the four planets stay exactly on their initial orbit until the disk dissipates , in order for the nice model to take place .      in all the simulations presented so far",
    ", the planets were not allowed to accrete .",
    "this may appear unrealistic at first sight , but on the other hand , accretion must have stopped anyhow before the masses of the planets exceed the present masses .",
    "this is certainly a critical issue for the formation of jupiter and saturn , because the accretion timescale for so massive planets should be very short . in both density profiles studied here",
    ", free accretion of the planets leads to too high masses .",
    "this open problem requires a complete , dedicated study , that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we make the assumption that some mechanism prevented accretion to go on when jupiter and saturn reached their actual masses . however , a few comments are in order .    in the simulation presented in figure  [ fig : hayashi ] ,",
    "the gas density at the bottom of the gap created by saturn is of the order of 3 times the one at the bottom of the gap of jupiter .",
    "if this situation lasts a few hundred thousand years , saturn may accrete more gas than jupiter on the long term .",
    "this would be a problem for the @xcite mechanism : a lighter outer planet than the inner one is required for the migration to be slowed down , stopped , or reversed . in the solar system though , we know that the mass of saturn somehow remained smaller than a third of the mass of jupiter .",
    "this mass ratio allows the migration of the pair to be negligible over the disc life time , with suitable disk parameters .",
    "therefore , the @xcite mechanism applies .",
    "an other issue with accretion concerns type  iii migration . @xcite have observed that allowing the planet to accrete , may prevent the runaway migration .",
    "however , this is most likely because their accreting planets grow too fast from low mass planets in type  i migration to high mass planets in type  ii migration in a clean gap . with",
    "accretion turned on , but the planet mass artificially kept constant to @xmath182 , they find that type  iii migration occurs , which shows that accretion should not perturb too much the corotation torques responsible for the runaway . to check this ,",
    "we have restarted the simulation presented in section  [ subsec : hr ] and figure  [ fig : isoth_bw ] at the time where the planets are released , turning accretion by jupiter and saturn on .",
    "accretion is computed using the recipe by @xcite , with a timescale to accrete all the gas within @xmath183 of the planet equal to @xmath6  year , that is @xmath184 jupiter orbit .",
    "the evolution of the mass and semi major axis of jupiter are displayed in figure  [ fig : accr ] as the curves with @xmath150 symbols , compared to the solid line taken from figure  [ fig : isoth_bw ] .",
    "type  iii migration is confirmed ( and even enhanced ) , even if jupiter reaches 5 jupiter masses in a century .",
    "for all these reasons , and even if a deeper study of the accretion processes would certainly be valuable , we think that our results are robust as far as this issue is concerned .",
    "in this paper , we have confronted the @xcite solar nebula to the planetary migration issue .",
    "this disk has a high gas density , a high density slope , and this profile remains almost unchanged for 10 million years .",
    "therefore , the question of the planetary migration should not be eluded .",
    "the 2d1d version of fargo is particularly suited to such a study .",
    "the physical parameters of the disk are fixed , but a broad range of numerical parameters have been studied ( resolution , energy equation , fate of the planets that reach the inner edge of the 2d grid ) , as well as the influence of the aspect ratio .    the high density slope gives a negative non thermal horseshoe torque , that accelerates even more the inwards type  i migration of uranus and neptune .",
    "the high density permits type  iii migration of massive planets . in particular",
    ", we can not avoid an extremely fast inwards migration of jupiter . in spite of several attempts",
    ", it seems to be impossible to prevent a loss of all the giant planets in less than @xmath185 years , which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude shorter than the disk life time .",
    "taking into account the energy equation with a cooling compatible with the assumed temperature structure of the disk does not change the result .    preventing the migration of the giant planets",
    "requires interactions between the planets .",
    "however , as this disk is a massive , decretion disk , the @xcite mechanism to prevent jupiter and saturn from migrating inwards can not be applied .",
    "shortly said , we conclude that the @xcite nebula is incompatible with our present knowledge of planetary migration .",
    "so , we are facing a problem .",
    "either this new mmsn makes the planetary migration in the solar system an even more critical issue and makes obsolete the former solutions to prevent migration of the giant planets @xcite , or the existence of planetary migration makes this mmsn questionable ( in particular the apparently unavoidable type  iii migration of jupiter ) .",
    "a possible solution has been laid out in section  [ sec : hayashi ] .",
    "if one believes that the nice model is true , it is clear that the outer planets should have ended the disk phase in a more compact configuration than the present one .",
    "however , the migration of the planets can account for a formation on a larger radial range , followed by a compaction of the configuration of the giant planets , like in figure  [ fig : hayashi ] . then",
    ", a fully resonant configuration can be achieved , that can be compatible with the nice model , like in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the solid material that built the giant planets may come not only from the region around their respective orbits : dust drifts inwards in a protoplanetary disk @xcite , and small bodies migrate as well , so that the giant planets region may be replenished in solids by the outer parts of the disk .",
    "this enables the formation of jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune in a less massive disk than the desch nebula , to avoid the type  iii migration of jupiter . in section  [ sec : hayashi ] , we have seen that this is possible in the old @xcite nebula .",
    "however , there is no reason why the giant planets should have formed exactly where they presently orbit ; in particular the presence of an outer cold disk of planetesimals ( required in the nice model ) is problematic if neptune formed beyond 25  au .",
    "thus , a new construction of a mmsn is needed , that takes into account the nice model and the planetary formation constraints , like in @xcite , and also the migration of planets and planetesimals .    in any case ,",
    "our results show that planetary migration should be considered in the construction of a mmsn .",
    "the location where the planets form determines the gas density profile of the nebula , which determines the migration path of the planets , which drives the planets to a new position after the disk dissipation .",
    "this final configuration , and not the initial one , should be compatible with the nice model ( or with the present configuration if one does not believe that the nice model is true ) .",
    "this idea requires a detailed study , that is beyond the scope of this paper , but the results presented here advocate for such a self - consistent construction of the minimum mass solar nebula .",
