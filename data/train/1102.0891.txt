    "maxi ( monitor of all - sky x - ray image ) is the first astronomical mission operated on the iss ( international space station ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the payload was delivered to the iss by space shuttle endeavour on july 16 , 2009 , and installed on the japanese experiment module  exposed facility ( jem - ef or kibo - ef ) on july 24 .",
    "the mission was designed to achieve the best sensitivity and the highest energy resolution among the all - sky x - ray monitors performed so far by using two kinds of x - ray slit cameras , gas slit camera ( gsc , @xcite ) and solid - state slit camera ( ssc , @xcite ) , which work complementary .",
    "the gsc is the main x - ray camera to cover the energy band from 2 to 30 kev with a large area .",
    "it employs conventional slit camera that consists of xe - gas proportional counters and slit - and - slat collimators .",
    "twelve gas counters achieve a large detector area of 5350 @xmath1 .",
    "they are assembled into six identical units to cover wide fields of views ( fovs ) of @xmath2 degree@xmath3 .",
    "they are embodied in the maxi payload module such that they cover the earth - horizon and the zenith directions with an equal area .",
    "it enables us to cover the entire sky every 92-minute orbital period even if the gsc has to be partly downed in a heavy particle - radiation environment such as the passage of the saa ( south atlantic anomaly ) .",
    "the xe - gas counters employ resistive carbon - wire anodes to acquire one - dimensional position sensitivity .",
    "the gas volume of each counter is separated into six carbon - anode cells for main x - ray detectors and ten tungsten - anode cells for veto counters .",
    "the veto cells surround the carbon - anode cells to reduce backgrounds by the anti - coincidence - hit logic .",
    "total 14 anode signals in each counter are read out independently through an electronics unit and processed by on - board data processors .",
    "figure [ fig : maxi_gsc_schematic ] illustrates the schematic views of a single gsc camera unit and fovs of the whole six units on the iss low - earth orbit .",
    "the details of the instruments are described in @xcite .",

    "the main power of the maxi payload is supplied from the jem - ef via the payload interface unit ( piu ) .",
    "it was activated on august 3 , one week later since the payload was installed on the jem - ef . on august 4 ,",
    "the gsc electronics units ( gsc - e ) including the radiation - belt monitor ( rbm ) were switched on .",
    "the on - board rbm parameters , thresholds of the lower discriminators and count - rate criteria to down the gas counters , were then set up using the data taken for the first three days . on august 8 ,",
    "the high voltage of the first gas counter was activated and increased up to the nominal operation voltage of 1650 v. the first test observation was then performed for three hours and various analog / digital - electronic functions were verified .",
    "all the 12 counters were activated at the nominal 1650 v since august 10 to 13 one by one .",
    "each gas counter has 14 anode signals for both two ends of six carbon - wire anodes and two veto signals .",
    "each anode signal has individual pre - amplifier , a shaping amplifier , a lower discriminator ( ld ) , and an analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) which produces 14-bit pulse height .",
    "the gain of the shaping amplifier and the threshold of the lower discriminator of each signal can be changed by command .",
    "these parameters are adjusted according to the gas gain of individual anode wire . the first all - sky image by all 12 counters was taken on august 15 .",
    "gsc incorporates radiation - belt monitor ( rbm ) to monitor the flux of the cosmic rays in orbit .",
    "two silicon - pin - diode detectors with 0.2-mm thickness and 5@xmath45 mm@xmath3 area are equipped with each of gsc horizon and zenith center units .",
    "the detector on the horizon unit ( rbm - h ) is faced to the tangential direction of the iss motion along the earth horizon .",
    "the zenith unit ( rbm - z ) is faced perpendicular to the horizontal plane .",
    "the rbms always monitor count rates of cosmic rays with a certain energy deposit , whose threshold can be changed by commands .",
    "the level of the threshold is set at 50 kev , which corresponds to the half of the minimum ionization - loss energy of the relativistic particles .",
    "figure [ fig : rbmmap ] shows the rbm count - rate maps on the iss orbital area by rbm - h and rbm - z units , respectively , averaged over the data taken for the first year .",
    "the ratio of the rbm - h to the rbm - z count rate is shown at the bottom where contours of inclination angle of the magnetic field from the earth - horizontal plane are overlaid .",
    "the two rbm rates agree with each other in the low count - rate area below 0.2 hz , where the anti - correlations with the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity ( cor ) are clearly seen .",
    "it indicates that the origins are energetic cosmic rays .",
    "the cosmic - ray flux @xmath5 1 counts @xmath6 s@xmath7 and its relation with the cor are consistent with those obtained by asca ( @xcite ) and suzaku ( @xcite ) in low - earth orbit although the altitude of the iss , 340360 km , is different from that of these satellite , 530590 km .",
    "while the two rbm rates are agreed at the low radiation area , they are quite different in the high radiation area around the saa and the both geomagnetic poles located at the north of the north american continent and the south of the australian continent .",
    "the rbm - h rate is higher by an order of magnitude than the rbm - z rate in these area . from the correlation between their ratio and the inclination of the magnetic field",
    ", the difference is considered to be due to the anisotropy of the flux of trapped particles . a large number of cosmic - ray particles trapped by the geomagnetic fields are moving circularly on the horizontal plane around the magnetic pole .",
    "the rbm - z detector faced on the zenith direction is insensitive to the particles moving on the horizontal plane .",
    "the anisotropy of the trapped particles at the high latitude has also been recognized by images of particle tracks taken by the ssc ccd imager ( @xcite ) .",

    "the high voltages of all the twelve gas counters were set at the nominal 1650 v. they are reduced to 0 v when the iss passes through heavy particle background area defined by an on - board radiation - zone ( rz ) map . in the beginning of the mission , we set the rz map only at the saa .    on september 8 , 2009 ,",
    "the analog power on the gsc_6 counter was suddenly down .",
    "it was followed by the power down of another counter , gsc_9 , on september 14 .",
    "the data indicate that a carbon - anode wire in each of these counters was fractured .",
    "it was also suggested that the location fractured on the carbon wire would be where a large amount of discharges occurred repeatedly .",
    "we then changed the counter operation strategy so that any risks to cause potential damages on the carbon - anode wire such as discharge and heavy irradiation should be avoided as much as possible .",
    "the high - voltage reduction at the high latitude above 40@xmath0 was employed since september 23 .",
    "two noisy counters , gsc_a and gsc_b , which are considered to be fractured sooner , were also tentatively stopped on september 26 .    on march 26 , 2010 ,",
    "the analog power on the gsc_3 counter was downed , which were considered to be due to a carbon - wire fracture by breakdown discharge again . since then",
    ", the operation voltage was reduced to 1550 v if the counter had any discharge experience .",
    "as the results of these limited hv operation , the effective observation efficiency is reduced to about 40% .",
    "it is expected to reduce the sensitivity .",
    "the three counters suffering from the breakdown will be soon activated with great care .",
    "the gsc counter has a one - dimensional position sensitivity and performs scanning observation .",
    "backgrounds for any x - ray sources on the sky can be roughly estimated from the levels of the adjacent source - free region .",
    "the studies of the backgrounds are important because the residual backgrounds and its uncertainties limit the source - detection sensitivity .",
    "each gsc gas counter embodies six carbon - anode cells for main x - ray detector and the veto cells surrounding the carbon - anode cells .",
    "the cosmic - ray backgrounds are screened out on board by applying an anti - coincidence matrix to hit patterns of all anode signals in each counter .",
    "the efficiency of the background reduction depends on the ld threshold of the read - out signals .",
    "the amplifier gains and ld levels of all the read - out signals are tuned during the initial verification operation .",
    "the background rates of all the 12 gsc counters are found to have a similar time variation during the entire observation - operation period .",
    "they exhibit clear anti - correlations with the geomagnetic cor in orbit .",
    "figure [ fig : evbgrate_rigidity ] illustrates the ld - hit rate , the processed event rate after the anti - coincidence cut , and the cleaned event rate with the pha ( pulse - height amplitude ) range of the 230 kev energy band against the cor .",

    "data expected to include significant x - ray events from celestial bright x - ray sources are also excluded .",
    "the ratio of the anti - coincidence - event rate to the ld - hit rate is about 1:30 and almost constant over the entire period .",
    "it is quite similar with the ginga - lac case ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ld - hit rate is well agreed with the rbm rate taking the detector area , 90 @xmath1 per anode , into account .",
    "it indicates that they are the energetic cosmic - ray origin .",

    "the profile shows the fluorescent lines of ti - k at 4.6 kev from the gas - counter body and cu - k at 8.1 kev from the slat collimator made of phosphor bronze .",
    "these emission lines are used for the energy response calibration .",
    "the shape of the continuum in the energy band above 8 kev is quite sensitive to the cor .",
    "it suggests that the origins of these components would be energetic cosmic rays .",

    "each gsc counter has a sensitivity gap at the center of the anode wire due to the frame structure to support 0.1-mm thick beryllium window .",
    "it causes the dip at the center in the spatial distribution .",
    "the depth of the dips can be mostly explained by the extinction of the cxb component at the support structure .",
    "the profile of the residual background left after subtracting the cxb component is primarily flat and slightly increases at both ends of the anode wires .",
