    "the claim then follows .",
    "note that proposition [ prop : compatibleclosedorbits ] does not say whether @xmath413 is a periodic or singular orbit of @xmath178 .",
    "the focus of proposition [ prop : compatibleclosedorbits ] is on determining a sequence of compatible _ closed _ orbits , which can include both periodic _ and _ singular orbits of prefractal billiards .",
    "if it hits a corner of some larger peripheral square ( which has conic angle @xmath414 ) , then we must terminate the billiard trajectory at the corner and declare the orbit @xmath413 to be singular . on the other hand ,",
    "if the orbit avoids corners of peripheral squares , then it will constitute a periodic orbit .",
    "see figure [ fig : singper ] for examples of both types of orbits .",
    "recall from ",
    "[ subsubsec : translationsurfacesviarationalpolygonalbilliardtables ] that a rational billiard @xmath119 can be used to construct a translation surface by appropriately identifying @xmath158 many copies of @xmath119 , where @xmath170 .",
    "suppose @xmath36 is a self - similar sierpinski carpet billiard table and @xmath178 is an approximation of @xmath36 .",
    "then , each interior angle has a denominator @xmath416 .",
    "therefore , @xmath417 , meaning that , when four copies of @xmath178 are appropriately identified , we recover the corresponding translation surface @xmath415 ; see figure [ fig : squaretoruswithobstaclesandgeodesic2 ] for the case of a translation surface constructed from @xmath418 , as well as an illustration of how a billiard ball would traverse the corresponding translation surface .",
    "properly identified in such a way that the resulting translation surface is no longer a torus , but a higher genus surface .",
    "the geodesic shown here further indicates exactly how sides of @xmath344 are identified in the construction of @xmath419 .",
    "furthermore , the way in which sides of @xmath344 are identified makes the geodesic equivalent to a billiard orbit under the action of the group of symmetries acting on the billiard table to produce the translation surface . in the terminology introduced in  [ subsec : mathematicalbilliards ] , one could consider the geodesic in this figure to be the billiard orbit unfolded in the translation surface . ]    as previously shown in figure [ fig : reflectiondefinedincorners ] , reflection in a corner with an angle measuring @xmath420 in the square can be made well - defined .",
    "the justification for this is provided by the fact that in the associated translation surface , a vertex of the unit square is identified with three other vertices in such a way that the conic angle about the conic singularity is @xmath159 . in figure",
    "[ fig : squaretoruswithobstaclesandgeodesic ] , we see the effect that a removable singularity ( i.e. , a singularity with conic angle @xmath159 ) has on the straight - line flow .",
    "specifically , each point of @xmath3 corresponding to a corner of the zeroth level approximation @xmath194 ( or , the unit square billiard table ) , is a removable singularity of the translation surface ; each point of @xmath3 corresponding to a corner of a peripheral square of @xmath421 is a nonremovable singularity of the translation surface , with the conic angle about each nonremovable singularity measuring @xmath414 .",
    "that intersects removable conic singularities of the surface . as such , the straight - line flow can continue unimpeded . since the geodesic is equivalent to a billiard orbit in @xmath422 , reflection in the corners with angles measuring @xmath420",
    "can be determined from how an equivalent geodesic passes through the corresponding removable singularity . ]    using the formula given in equation ( [ eqn : genus ] ) , the genus @xmath423 of a translation surface @xmath3 is calculated as follows .",
    "@xmath424 then , for a sequence of rational ( prefractal ) billiard tables @xmath425 approximating @xmath0 , we have that @xmath426 .",
    "hence , if there is a translation surface associated with the ( yet to be properly defined ) self - similar billiard table @xmath36 , then such a translation surface presumably has infinite genus . on the other hand ,",
    "if such a surface is given as a suitable limit of translation surfaces @xmath415 , then such a surface will presumably have no surface area .",
    "in other words , it is reasonable to expect that a suitable translation surface can not be constructed as a suitable limit of a sequence of translation surfaces @xmath415 .",
    "in this paper we have made progress in identifying a family of periodic orbits in the self - similar carpet billiard @xmath36 .",
    "as of now , an orbit of a self - similar sierpinski carpet billiard is the trivial limit of an eventually constant sequence of compatible periodic orbits . as an interim goal",
    ", we would like to identify sequences of compatible periodic orbits that are not eventually constant , but converge ( in a suitable sense ) to a set that constitutes a periodic orbit of a self - similar sierpinski carpet billiard table @xmath36 .",
    "ultimately , we would like to construct a well - defined ( topological ) dynamical system on a self - similar sierpinski carpet billiard table and determine whether or not there exists a topological dichotomy for the billiard flow .",
    "if one can construct a well - defined notion of reflection for @xmath36 , is it possible to show that , for a fixed direction @xmath427 , the billiard flow in the direction @xmath427 is either closed or dense in @xmath36 ?    in constructing the translation surface corresponding to @xmath2 , we have come up with a concrete example of a sequence of translation surfaces whose genera increase to infinity as @xmath35 .",
    "however , because @xmath1 has zero lebesgue area , it is unclear exactly how to describe the limit of the sequence of translation surfaces as a translation surface , let alone a surface with any specific structure .",
    "[ ques : suitablenotionoflimittranslationsurface ] can one apply a suitable notion of limit to a sequence of translation surfaces @xmath428 so as to recover a ` surface ' with some structure that is analogous to that of a translation surface ?    if question [ ques : suitablenotionoflimittranslationsurface ] can be answered in the affirmative , a natural question to ask is whether one can determine a flow on @xmath429 , and whether such a flow can be shown to be equivalent to the ( yet to be determined ) billiard flow on @xmath36 .",
    "a related ( and interesting ) problem involves investigating the behavior of a sequence of compatible orbits of billiard tables which share a similar construction with the self - similar sierpinski carpet billiard table @xmath0 , but occupy nonzero area .",
    "a clear candidate is the non - self - similar sierpinski carpet @xmath1 with @xmath430 being a sequence in @xmath431 ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath432 ) . since @xmath433 in this setting , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.3(a ) ) implies that @xmath1 contains nontrivial line segments of every rational slope , and contains no nontrivial line segments of any irrational slope .",
    "one may then begin to discuss and analyze the behavior of a sequence of compatible orbits with each orbit having an initial direction given by @xmath434 .    a related sierpinski carpet billiard we may consider investigating is a so - called _ fat sierpinski carpet _ billiard table , constructed as follows .",
    "begin by fixing a positive odd integer @xmath37 , and partition the unit square into @xmath435 many squares of side - length @xmath436 .",
    "rather than removing the open middle square of side - length @xmath436 as in the first - stage of the construction of a self - similar sierpinski carpet , one removes an open square of side - length @xmath437 , @xmath438 . in the second stage of the construction ,",
    "a square of side - length @xmath439 centered within each of the remaining @xmath440 squares of side - length @xmath436 is removed .",
    "this process is then repeated ad infinitum . in effect , each removed square of side - length @xmath441 is surrounded by a solid square annulus of width @xmath442 .",
    "such a carpet admits nontrivial line segments of irrational slopes , and there will be additional base points from which a nontrivial line segment can emanate .",
    "we can then ask the following question .",
    "how does the existence and behavior of a sequence of compatible dense orbits depend on @xmath443 ? moreover , can one recover a dense orbit of the self - similar sierpinski carpet billiard @xmath0 in the limit as @xmath444 ?",
    "the development of our understanding of the sierpinski carpet billiard table may be possibly aided by studying the results for other types of billiard tables .",
    "in particular , the so - called wind - tree billiard tables ( and generalizations of them ) investigated in @xcite are very reminiscent of a sierpinski carpet billiard table .",
    "alternatively , we may be able to approach the problem of determining billiard dynamics on @xmath0 by taking an algebraic perspective .",
    "for each translation surface @xmath3 , there is an associated__veech group__. a veech group of a translation surface @xmath167 determined from a rational billiard table @xmath119 is the stabilizer of @xmath167 .",
    "the work of @xcite may prove useful in determining a well - defined translation structure on a suitable limit of a sequence of translation surfaces @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , analyzing the inverse limit of an inverse limit sequence of veech groups @xmath445 ( assuming such an inverse limit sequence can be properly constructed ) may yield a group that is the stabilizer of some surface .",
    "with such a surface and an associated stabilizer defined , we may begin to investigate whether or not the proposed surface contains saddle connections .",
    "the directions of such saddle connections may then indicate directions for which closed geodesics are occurring .",
