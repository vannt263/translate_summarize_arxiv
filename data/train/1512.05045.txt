    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods in configuration space have been increasing the popularity in molecular electronic structure studies in recent years.@xcite the majority of these approaches are on the basis of the projection , ( ) = e^-(h - e)(0 ) , [ eq : proj ] that converges to the lowest eigen function with a nonzero overlap with the initial wavefunction @xmath0 after a sufficiently long time interval @xmath1 . several extensions for excited states",
    "have been also proposed.@xcite one promising approach among them is the model space qmc ( msqmc ) based on the effective hamiltonian formalism .",
    "we shall outline the main features of msqmc in what follows .              , [ eq : itmc ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the projection operators onto the the model space ( p - space ) and its orthogonal component ( q - space ) , respectively , and the subscripts of the hamiltonian mean the individual contributions like @xmath6 .",
    "msqmc treats the model space amplitude @xmath7 deterministically by the diagonalization of effective hamiltonian , and the imaginary time evolution of @xmath8 for a fixed @xmath9 is calculated as = - ( h_qq - e)_q()-h_qp_p.[eq : itetc ] we have recently formulated the ite for the energy dependent partitioning ( edp),@xcite = -(*h*_qq-*i*_qqe)*t*_qp -*h*_qp,[eq : itm_tqp_edp ] as a sufficiency condition of ( [ eq : itetc ] ) , where @xmath10 is the transfer matrix connecting the configuration interaction ( ci ) coefficients in the p- and q - spaces as @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the identity matrix .",
    "the stationary solution of ( [ eq : itm_tqp_edp ] ) , ( * h*_qq-*i*_qqe)*t*_qp + * h*_qp=0,[eq : loewdin ] corresponds to the lwdin partitioning@xcite applicable to arbitrary electronic states in the vicinity of @xmath13 ( even with degeneracy ) .",
    "the dimension of @xmath10 can be sizable for a full ci ( fci ) problem , and the partitioning technique is usually worthless for determining the exact solutions .",
    "however , the population dynamics of walkers allows us to treat @xmath10 stochastically and to integrate the contribution , @xmath14 , to the effective hamiltonian on - the - fly.@xcite note the ite ( [ eq : itm_tqp_edp ] ) provids a general framework to solve the linear system of equations ( [ eq : loewdin ] ) in a stochastic manner .",
    "the msqmc in edp is robust and in principle capable of treating arbitrary excited states as has been demonstrated in the calculation of potential energy curves of diatomic molecules , recently.@xcite one of the shortcomings of edp is that independent qmc processes are required for electronic states with different target energies .",
    "moreover , the computational cost for each of the qmc processes grows linearly with the dimension of the model space . in the previous paper,@xcite we noted there",
    "exists an alternative choice of the eigenvalue independent partitioning ( eip ) in msqmc where all solutions of the effective hamiltonian converge to the fci limits simultaneously.@xcite nevertheless , eip seemingly suffers from the intruder state problems as likewise in the usual state - universal multi - reference approaches . in this communication",
    ", we develop a new partitioning to solve all of these points at issue .",
    "this work was partly supported by the strategic programs for innovative research ( spire ) and flagship2020 as the priority issue 5 ( development of new fundamental technologies for high - efficiency energy creation , conversion / storage and use ) of mext , and the computational materials science initiative ( cmsi ) .",
    "we are also grateful for the computer resources through the hpci system research project ( project i d : hp150228 , hp150278 ) .",
