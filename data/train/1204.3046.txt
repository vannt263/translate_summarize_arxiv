    "although the determination of capacity region of the interference channel ( ic ) has been a long standing open problem , several interesting recent results shed light on the problem from various perspectives . among these",
    "we may cite the capacity region obtained for special cases @xcite , or obtained for general channel classes in both scalar and mimo settings up to approximations with bounded gaps @xcite .",
    "when specializing to the large snr regime , it is known that the characterization of the full capacity region can be conveniently replaced with the determination of the so - called degree - of - freedom ( dof ) region .",
    "progress on that particular front was reported in @xcite with the derivation of the dof region for the two - user mimo interference channel with @xmath0 , @xmath1 transmit antennas and @xmath2 , @xmath3 receive antennas , where the sum dof @xmath4 is shown to be optimal .",
    "most of these advances suggest achievable schemes which require the full knowledge of channel state information ( csi ) at both the transmitter and receiver sides .",
    "in fact , the cruciality of csi at the transmitter side in particular is demonstrated in such works as @xcite where the dof region is shown to shrink dramatically when zero csit is available .",
    "the intermediate scenario of _ limited _ or _ incomplete _ csit was also considered in @xcite . in @xcite , the rate of limited feedback needed to preserve the dof optimality in interference alignment - enabled ic is provided .",
    "more recently , the impact of feedback delays providing the transmitter with outdated csi over mimo channels was considered in @xcite for the broadcast channel ( bc ) and later extended to the ic @xcite .",
    "the key contribution in @xcite was to establish the usefulness of even completely outdated channel state information in designing precoders achieving significantly better dof than what is obtained without any csit .",
    "considering the worst case scenarios , including those where the feedback delay extends beyond the coherence period of the time varying fading channels , the authors in  @xcite propose a space - time interference alignment - inspired strategy achieving an optimal sum dof of 4/3 for the two - user miso bc , in a setting when the no csit case yields no more than 1 dof .",
    "the essential ingredient for the proposed scheme in @xcite lies in the use of multi - slot protocol initiating with the transmission of unprecoded information symbols to the user terminals , followed by the analog forwarding of the interference overheard in the first time slot .",
    "recently , this strategy was generalized under similar principle to the interference channel setting @xcite , again establishing dof strictly beyond the ones obtained without csit in scenarios where the delayed csit bears no correlation with the current channel realization .",
    "albeit inspiring and fascinating in nature , such results nonetheless rely on the somewhat over - pessimistic assumption that no estimate for the _ current _ channel realization is available to the transmitter . owing to the finite doppler spread behavior of fading channels , it is however the case in many real life situations that the past channel realizations can provide information about the current one",
    ". therefore a scenario where the transmitter is endowed with delayed csi in addition to some ( albeit imperfect ) estimate of the current channel is practical relevance .",
    "this form of combined delayed and imperfect current csit was recently introduced in @xcite for the multiple - antenna broadcast channel whereby a novel transmission scheme is proposed which extends beyond the mat algorithm in allowing the exploitation of precoders designed based on the current csit estimate .",
    "the full characterization of the optimal dof for the hybrid csit was reported in @xcite and independently in @xcite .",
    "the key idea behind the schemes in @xcite lies in the modification of the mat protocol where i ) the initial time slot involves transmission of _ precoded _ symbols , followed by the forwarding of _ residual _ interference overheard in the first time slot , and ii ) the taking advantage of the reduced power for the residual interference ( compared with full power interference in mat ) based on a suitable quantization method and digital transmission .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the results in  @xcite and consider the two - user time - correlated multiple - antenna interference channel .",
    "a similar hybrid csit scenario is considered whereby each transmitter has access to delayed channel samples for the links it is connected to , as well as possessing an imperfect estimate of the current channel .",
    "the current csit estimate could be obtained from , e.g. , a linear prediction applied to past samples @xcite , although the prediction aspects are not specified in this paper .",
    "instead , the quality level for the current csit estimate is simply modeled in terms of an exponent of the transmit power level , allowing dof characterization for various ranges of current csit quality .",
    "thus our model bridges between previously reported csit scenarios such as the pure delayed csit of @xcite and the pure instantaneous csit scenarios .",
    "we assume each receiver has access to its own perfect instantaneous csi and the perfect delayed csi of other receivers ( as in e.g. @xcite ) , in addition to the imperfect current csi .",
    "in what follows we obtain the following key results :    * we establish an outer bound on the dof region for the two - user temporally - correlated miso interference channel with perfect delayed and imperfect current csit , as a function of the current csit quality exponent .",
    "this result is initially derived for the two - antenna transmitters and then generalized .",
    "* we propose two schemes which achieve the key vertices of the outer bound with perfect delayed and imperfect current csit .",
    "the schemes build on the principles of time - slotted protocol , starting with the zf precoded transmission of information symbols from the two interfering transmitters simultaneously and followed by forwarding of the residual interferences . as in the bc case ,",
    "the residual interference reflects on the quality of the initial precoder and can be shown to be quantized and power scaled in a suitable way to achieve the optimal dof .",
    "* our results coincide with previously reported dof results for the perfect csit setting ( current csit of perfect quality ) and pure delayed csit setting ( current csit of zero quality ) . * the dof region of certain mimo cases",
    "is also provided as a function of the current csit quality exponent and the number of receive antennas .",

    "while @xmath50 reflects the case with no current csit , @xmath51 corresponds to that with perfect instantaneous csit . as a matter of fact , when @xmath52 , the quality of the imperfect current csit is sufficient to avoid the dof loss , and zf precoding with this imperfect csit is able to achieve the maximum dof  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we focus on the case @xmath53 $ ] hereafter . the connections between the above model and the linear prediction over existing time - correlated channel models with prescribed user mobility are highlighted in @xcite .",
    "according to the definition of the estimated current csit , we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and ( [ eq : p - to - alpha ] ) is obtained from ( [ eq : alpha - def ] ) .",

    "the capacity region @xmath70 is defined as the set of all achievable rate pairs .",
    "accordingly , the dof region can be defined as follows :    [ the degree - of - freedom region ] the degree - of - freedom ( dof ) region for two - user miso interference channel is defined as @xmath71    consequently , the dof region for the two - user time - correlated miso interference channel is stated in the following theorem .    in the two - user miso interference channel with perfect delayed csit and imperfect current csit ( as stated in assumption  2 ) , the optimal dof region can be characterized by    @xmath72    * remark * : interestingly , the above dof region is identical to that of the two - user miso broadcast channel with perfect delayed csit and imperfect current csit @xcite .",
    "in fact , this result is consistent with previous results on the pure delayed csit case ( @xmath50 ) where it was shown that the dof region for the two - user bc and the two - user ic coincides , and also on the special case of perfect instantaneous csit ( @xmath73 ) .    for illustration , the dof region for the two - user miso ic",

    "the dof region is identical to that when @xmath223 , coinciding with the region for two - user miso broadcast channel .",

    "for the sake of simplicity , we omit the channel encoding and decoding process of @xmath280 , and therefore , it looks as if @xmath279 itself is conveyed .      the objective of the slot-2 is to convey the codeword vector @xmath277 whose information is carried on a coded common message @xmath281 together with a new symbol vector at the tx-1 , while only a new symbol vector is sent at the tx-2 . by omitting the encoding and decoding process of @xmath281 , the equivalent transmitted signals are    @xmath282    where @xmath283 and @xmath284 .",

    "the detailed proof can be analogically derived according to the miso case and hence omitted here .",
    "we characterize the dof region of the two - user miso and certain mimo interference channels where the transmitter has access to both delayed csi as well as an estimate of the current csi .",
    "in particular , these results are suited to time - correlated fading channels for which a latency - prone feedback channel provided the transmitter with the delayed samples , based on which a prediction mechanism can be applied to obtain the current imperfect csi .",
    "our dof region covers a family of csit settings , coinciding with previously reported results for extreme situations such as pure delayed csit and pure current csit . for intermediate regimes , the dof achieving scheme relies on the forwarding to users of a suitably quantized version of prior interference obtained under imperfect linear zf precoding at the two transmitters .",
