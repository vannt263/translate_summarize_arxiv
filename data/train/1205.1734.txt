    "one of the most enduring open questions surrounding active galactic nuclei ( agns ) concerns the relation between accretion and ejection processes , i.e. , what is the connection between the black hole , the accretion disc and the formation of outflows and jets ?",
    "then , a related question is , what is the feedback impact of agn outflows / jets on the host galaxy and surrounding environment ?",
    "new insights on the characteristics and importance of winds / outflows in radio - quiet agns have been recently obtained thanks to deep _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ and _ suzaku _ observations . in particular , the detection of blue - shifted fe  xxv - xxvi absorption lines in the x - ray spectra of several sources demonstrated the presence of massive , highly ionized and mildly / nearly relativistic accretion disk outflows ( e.g. , chartas et al .",

    "3c  111 is actively monitored with the vlba at 43  ghz at roughly monthly intervals by the blazar group at the boston university . here",
    "we present a temporal extension of the vlba analysis of ch11 ( see their fig .",
    "6 ) from 2008 up to mid 2011 .",
    "the sequence of vlba images shown in fig .  2 provides a dynamic view of the inner jet between november 2010 and september 2011 at an angular resolution @xmath10.1 milliarcseconds ( mas ) , corresponding to @xmath10.094  pc .",
    "the vlba data have been processed in the same manner as described in ch11 .",
    "we can clearly observe the presence of two new radio jet knots , each characterized by its flux density , fwhm diameter and position relative to the core .",
    "times of `` ejection '' are defined as the extrapolated time of coincidence of a moving knot with the position of the 43  ghz core .",
    "we use the position vs. time data to determine the projected direction on the sky of the inner jet , as well as the apparent speeds and ejection times of new superluminal knots .",
    "continuing with the nomenclature adopted by ch11 , we have knot k10 appearing from the 43  ghz core at @xmath2 and k11 at @xmath3 , respectively . both of them have apparent superluminal velocities of @xmath4c and @xmath5c , respectively .",
    "the proper motion of these knots can be directly followed in fig .  2 for almost one year .",
    "the dates relative to the x - ray dips and jet knots appearance between 2008 and 2011 are marked in the rxte light curve in fig .  1 by arrows .",
    "we see that , in line with the reported correlation between x - ray dips and jet ejections ( ch11 ) , new radio jet knots systematically appear a few months after major x - ray dips . this is valid also for the two new detected ones , k10 and k11 , which appear about @xmath13 months after the relative x - ray dips d10 and d11 .",
    "we are confident that the dips d10 and d11 are indeed related to the knots k10 and k11 for several reasons : there is no significant detection of a new knot ejection in the radio images between 2010.60 and 2010.80 , the time interval between d10 and d11 is equivalent to that between k10 and k11 and also both knots appear in the radio images with an equivalent delay of about 3 months after the relative dips . in general , the delay is distributed between 0.03  yr and 0.34  yr , with a mean value of @xmath6  yr ( ch11 ) . as already discussed by ch11 ,",
    "considering the apparent speeds of @xmath145c , an average delay from the x - ray dips of @xmath10.15  yr and an inclination of @xmath118@xmath7 , we can derive that the typical distance traveled by the jet knots before appearing out from the 43  ghz core is @xmath8@xmath10.6pc .",
    "considering the jet knots k7 and k10 , their actual bulk velocity ( @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 ) can be estimated from the apparent velocity ( @xmath12@xmath10@xmath13 ) adopting an inclination to the line of sight of @xmath14@xmath118@xmath7 ( jorstad et al .",
    "2005 ) , @xmath15 .",
    "we obtain @xmath16@xmath170.982c and @xmath18@xmath17@xmath19c and the relative lorentz factors ( @xmath20@xmath10@xmath21 ) are @xmath22@xmath15.3 and @xmath23@xmath1710 for k7 and k10 , respectively .",
    "the knot k10 is faster than k7 and their parameters are reported in table  2 .",
    "assuming equipartition and using the formula ( a3 ) in jorstad & marscher ( 2004 ) we derive an estimate of the magnetic field of @xmath24@xmath170.1  gauss , consistent with the typical values at @xmath1sub - pc scales ( e.g. , osullivan & gabuzda 2009 ) .",
    "then , it is possible to roughly quantify the jet kinetic power as @xmath25@xmath17@xmath26@xmath1@xmath27  erg  s@xmath28 , where @xmath8 is the previously estimated distance of the knots from the black hole .",
    "however , if we include also the possible additional term due to the rest - mass energy of the protons , the kinetic power can reach values up to @xmath1@xmath29  erg  s@xmath28 .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the typical jet power of radio galaxies estimated from the associated radio lobes of @xmath30@xmath1@xmath31@xmath29  erg  s@xmath28 ( e.g. , rawlings & saunders 1991 ) .",
    "subsequently , from the relation @xmath25@xmath17@xmath32 we can also calculate the mass flux rate that is funneled into the jet . considering the average @xmath20@xmath17 of the jet knots in table  2 ,",
    "we obtain a mass outflow rate of @xmath33@xmath170.00050.005  @xmath34  yr@xmath28 .",
    "0.16 mas@xmath35 at pa=-10@xmath36 , the contours levels start at 0.25% of the peak and increase by a factor of 2 .",
    "the lines denote the proper motion of the radio jet knots k10 and k11.,width=283,height=831 ]",
    "in this paper we focus on a comparison between the parameters of the jet and accretion disc outflows , also referred as ufos , observed in 3c  111 .",
    "this is the first time that such a study is performed for an agn .",
    "the typical kinetic power of the ufos reported in table  1 is @xmath37@xmath1@xmath38@xmath31  erg  s@xmath28 .",
    "this is about one order of magnitude lower than the kinetic power of the jet .",
    "however , if we take into account the uncertainty in the determination of the jet kinetic power and the possibility that the jet knots experienced an additional acceleration with respect to the ufos , it is plausible that their values are actually comparable .",
    "in fact , the ufos were detected at distances of only @xmath10.0010.02  pc from the black hole , well within the @xmath10.6  pc scale of the 43ghz core , after which new jet knots are observable in the vlba images .",
    "the mass outflow rate of the ufos of @xmath39@xmath10.11  @xmath34  yr@xmath28 is much higher than that estimated for the jet @xmath33@xmath10.00050.005  @xmath34  yr@xmath28 .",
    "moreover , even if their kinetic power is different , their momentum flux is actually equivalent .",
    "this is due to the linear dependence of this quantity on the outflow velocity .",
    "the ratio of the kinetic power with respect to the bolometric luminosity corresponds to @xmath1110% and @xmath110100% for the ufos and the jet , respectively .",
    "therefore , both of them are able to exert a concurrent feedback impact on the surrounding environment ( e.g. , hopkins & elvis 2010 ; gaspari et al .",
    "however , an interesting point to make here is that the powerful and collimated jet tends to `` drill '' out of the galaxy and deliver energy and momentum to large distances . on the other hand",
    ", the slower , wider angle and massive ufos may be much more effective at impacting the structures of the host galaxy ( e.g. , tombesi et al .",
    "in fact , from the fraction of sources with detected ufos tombesi et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) estimated that these absorbers cover a significant fraction of the solid angle , @xmath10.4 .",
    "this corresponds to an opening angle of the outflow with respect to the polar axis of @xmath160@xmath7 . instead , jorstad et al .",
    "( 2005 ) derived an intrinsic half opening angle of the jet in 3c  111 of only @xmath13@xmath7 .",
    "this indicates that the jet covers only a fraction of @xmath10.001 of the solid angle , which corresponds to less than 1% of that of the ufos .",
    "the lower limit of the density of the material in the ufos can be roughly derived as @xmath40@xmath10@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 .",
    "this is valid for compact absorbers ( @xmath44@xmath451 ) and is supported by the detection of short time - scale variability ( e.g. , braito et al .  2007 ;",
    "cappi et al .",
    "2009 ; tombesi et al .  2010a , 2011b ) .",
    "for both u7 and u10 we obtain @xmath40@xmath42@xmath46  @xmath47 . from the photo - ionization code",
    "xstar used for the modelling of the fe  xxv  xxvi absorption lines in tombesi et al .",
    "( 2010b , 2011a , 2011b ) we obtain a typical temperature of the plasma of @xmath48@xmath1@xmath49@xmath46  k. therefore , the lower limit on the gas thermal pressure in the ufos is @xmath50@xmath17@xmath51@xmath420.0010.01  dyne  @xmath52",
    ". this can be even higher considering the significant turbulent velocities of @xmath11,000  km / s observed for ufos ( tombesi et al .  2011a , 2011b ) .",
    "using the estimate of the jet kinetic power of @xmath30@xmath1@xmath31@xmath29  erg  s@xmath28 and assuming a quasi - instantaneous , symmetrical injection of energy , we can derive a crude lower limit of the jet ram pressure at the location of the ufos of @xmath53@xmath17@xmath54@xmath420.0010.01  dyne  @xmath52 .",
    "these two estimates are comparable , suggesting that accretion disc outflows in the form of ufos may actually help collimate the inner jet .",
    "this also suggests that the initial jet material would encounter more radial than vertical resistance , providing a preferential direction of propagation and this could lead to a `` nozzle - like '' geometrical configuration , which would again help collimate / confine the inner jet ( e.g. , blandford & rees 1974 ) .    in this regard",
    ", we note that recent detailed observations of the inner radio jet of m87 , the closest powerful radio - loud agn to us , revealed that the jet formation is already taking place at distances down to @xmath11020@xmath55 from the super - massive black hole ( hada et al .",
    "moreover , in the inner few @xmath1100@xmath55 region the jet is seen opening widely , at an angle of @xmath1@xmath56 , and having a paraboloidal shape .",
    "then , it squeezes down to @xmath1@xmath57 only at distances of @xmath1@xmath58@xmath55 , after which it transits into a conical shape and becomes a free stream ( asada & nakamura 2012 ) .",
    "this suggests that the jet is probably subject to an initial collimation by the external gas .",
    "the simultaneous presence at sub - pc scales of these two components in rough pressure equilibrium : a inner , highly relativistic jet , and an outer , more massive , mildly relativistic plasma , is overall consistent with the picture of a transverse stratification of the flow ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .  2005 ; xie et al .",
    "the line - of - sight inclination angle of 3c  111 is in fact @xmath59 ( jorstad et al .  2005 ) .",
    "therefore , this eventuality should be considered when performing numerical simulations of the jet formation .",
    "theoretically , the complex coupling between radiation , magnetic fields and matter that should be considered to properly explain the formation of outflows / winds from accretion discs has not been accurately solved yet .",
    "however , simulations show that disc outflows are ubiquitously produced and can be accelerated to mildly relativistic velocities by radiation and/or magnetic forces ( blandford & payne 1982 ; king & pounds 2003 ; proga & kallman 2004 ; ohsuga et al .  2009 ; fukumura et al .  2010 ) .",
    "moreover , several mhd jet models predict that the jet production is accompanied by the formation of broad , mildly relativistic disc outflows ( blandford & payne 1982 ; kato et al .",
    "2004 ; mckinney & gammie 2004 ; mckinney 2006 ; tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2011 ) , potentially providing a direct link between these components .",
    "however , even if mhd models alone could , in principle , already explain the formation of the jet and mildly relativistic disc outflows , the high radiation throughput of agns can not be neglected and radiation pressure must play an important role as well ( king & pounds 2003 ; everett & ballantyne 2004 ; everett 2005 ; ohsuga et al .  2009 ; ramrez & tombesi 2012 ) . the comparison with the similar outflows detected in radio - quiet agns , which however are known to harbor weak jets as well ( e.g. , giroletti & panessa 2009 ; maitra et al .",
    "2011 ) , may help to clarify this point .",
    "this is postponed to a future work .    comparing the periods of x - ray dips and the observations of ufos and jet knots in fig .  1 and table  2 we note that ufo u7 was observed between the x - ray dip d7 and the jet knot k7 .",
    "similarly , u10 was observed between d10 and k10 .",
    "this evidence is intriguing and may suggest the placement of ufos within the known dip - ejection cycles , which is the most solid observational proof of the disc - jet connection ( marscher et al .  2002 ;",
    "chatterjee et al .  2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "as already discussed by ch11 , the x - ray dip - ejection connection suggests that a decrease in the x - ray production is linked to an increase in the speed of the jet flow , causing a shock front to eventually form and move downstream . the actual physical cause of this relation is currently still a matter of considerable speculation , however , it has similarities with the stellar - mass black holes ( e.g. , livio et al .",
    "2003 ; neilsen & lee 2009 ; king et al .",
    "2012 ) , for which more detailed studies have been performed .",
    "thermal instabilities in the inner accretion disc can cause a state transition between a radiatively efficient to a low - efficient accretion mode during the x - ray dips , such as in the adaf / adios regimes ( narayan & yi 1995 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) , which predicts that a sizeable fraction of the accretion power is not radiated away and instead is released in the form of a jet or outflow .",
    "in particular , the jet production mechanism has been demonstrated to be more efficient for both high black hole spins and thick , adaf - like , inner accretion disks ( meier 2001 ; nemmen et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we note that tombesi et al .",
    "( 2011b ) detected an ionized fe k disc line in the x - ray spectrum of the third observation in table  1 .",
    "this observation occurred during a short steady / decreasing flux period after the x - ray dip d10 and no clear ufo was detected .",
    "instead , a blue - shifted fe xxvi absorption line indicative of a ufo was detected in the successive fourth observation , @xmath17 days after , during a clear periods of ascending flux .",
    "the 210  kev s / n of the third observation ( @xmath17105 ) was enough to detect an absorption line with the same ew as in the fourth ( s / n@xmath17110 ) if present and its constancy between these two observations was excluded at the 99.9% .",
    "therefore , the lack of detection of a ufo in the third observation points to the conclusion that it was probably not present along the line - of - sight at that time , but we can not rule out also the possibility that the non - detection was due to strong inhomogeneities / turbulence in the flow . as already stated in sec . 2.2 , we note that the identification of the third observation with a steady / decreasing flux state is less clear because it happened close to a sudden spike in flux and we adopted a conservative approach not considering it in the discussion of the possible relation between the ufos and period of increasing flux .",
    "tombesi et al .",
    "( 2011b ) interpreted these observations as the evidence of a connection between thermal / structural instabilities in the disc , possibly related to an adaf state ( wang , cheng & li 2012 ) , and the formation of powerful winds / outflows .",
    "interestingly , even if the launching mechanism(s ) of the ufos might not be the same as for the jet , the fact that these observations occurred within two clear dip - ejection cycles suggests that they could be related , in the sense that the strong disc / radiative instabilities that are known to accompany the ejection of a new jet knot could then also trigger or boost the production of disc outflows ( livio et al .",
    "2003 ; xie et al .",
    "we note that a similar qualitative behavior , whereby the ejection of jet knots during x - ray dips is followed by an increased production of disc outflows during the successive rising / flaring periods , has been recently reported by neilsen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) regarding the galactic microquasar grs  1915@xmath60105 during the @xmath61 state .",
    "the main point that we would like to make here is to introduce the notion that ufos could preferentially appear during phases of increasing flux and possibly at certain times of disc - jet activity .",
    "however , given the very limited number of observations , the statistical significance of these relations is only tentative and additional observations are needed to test this properly10  days , a long 100ks _",
    "suzaku _ and _ xmm - newton _ observation every 2 months , a long 100ks _ chandra _ hetg observation every 4 months and a parallel vlba monitoring at intervals of 3 months . if approved , this will allow to have enough observations to conclusively test the relation between ufos and the jet dip - ejection cycles . ] . nonetheless",
    ", we can certainly conclude that there are now plenty of theoretical and observational evidences that mass and energy loss in the form of winds / outflows from the accretion disc are likely to be the norm rather than the exception and models attempting to explain the link between the jet and the accretion process should take these components into account .",
    "in this paper we compare the characteristics of the x - ray detected accretion disc outflows , also referred as ufos , and the radio jet in the broad - line radio galaxy 3c  111 .",
    "this is the first time that such a study is performed for an agn .",
    "we find that these two outflows , an inner relativistic one and another broader and mildly - relativistic , coexist on sub - pc scales , possibly in agreement with a transverse stratification of a global flow .",
    "the two are also potentially in pressure equilibrium , providing additional support for the collimation of the jet .",
    "the disc outflows are much more massive than the jet but probably their kinetic power is lower . however , their momentum flux is comparable and both of them are capable to exert a concurrent feedback impact on the surrounding environment . even though a link between these component is already naturally predicted by mhd jet",
    "/ outflows simulations , we note that also radiation pressure must be taken into account for a more realistic modelling .",
    "the comparison of the detection times of ufos with the long - term rxte light curve suggests that they are preferentially observed during periods of increasing flux and the investigation of the vlba images points to the possibility of placing also these events within the known x - ray dip - ejection cycles , which is the direct evidence of the disc - jet interaction .",
    "however , given the limited number of observations , these possible relations are only tentative and additional observations are needed to test them properly . if confirmed , this could provide a new window for x - ray spectroscopy to study processes related to the jet activity on scales even smaller than the @xmath10.1 milliarcsec reachable with vlba images .",

    "<S> we present a comparison of the parameters of accretion disc outflows and the jet of the broad - line radio galaxy 3c  111 on sub - pc scales . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of published x - ray observations of ultra - fast outflows ( ufos ) and new 43  ghz vlba images to track the jet knots ejection . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the superluminal jet coexists with the mildly relativistic outflows on sub - pc scales , possibly indicating a transverse stratification of a global flow . </S>",
    "<S> the two are roughly in pressure equilibrium , with the ufos potentially providing additional support for the initial jet collimation . </S>",
    "<S> the ufos are much more massive than the jet , but their kinetic power is probably about an order of magnitude lower , at least for the observations considered here . </S>",
    "<S> however , their momentum flux is equivalent and both of them are powerful enough to exert a concurrent feedback impact on the surrounding environment . </S>",
    "<S> a link between these components is naturally predicted in the context of mhd models for jet / outflow formation . </S>",
    "<S> however , given the high radiation throughput of agns , radiation pressure should also be taken into account . from the comparison with the long - term 210  kev rxte light curve we find that the ufos are preferentially detected during periods of increasing flux . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the possibility to place the ufos within the known x - ray dips - jet ejection cycles , which has been shown to be a strong proof of the disc - jet connection , in analogue with stellar - mass black holes . </S>",
    "<S> however , given the limited number of observations presently available , these relations are only tentative and additional spectral monitoring is needed to test them conclusively .    </S>",
