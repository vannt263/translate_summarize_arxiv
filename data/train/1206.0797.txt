    "a many - body system ( e.g. a cold @xmath0-level atomic cloud ) interacting with a @xmath1-mode radiation field inside an optical cavity in the dipolar approximation is described by the dicke model  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this model is the presence of a phase transition from the normal to the superradiant behavior  @xcite .",
    "this is a collective effect involving all @xmath2 atoms in the sample , where the decay rate is proportional to @xmath3 instead of @xmath2 , the expected result for independent atom emission .",
    "while this transition has been much debated in the literature , mainly due to the fact that it requires a very strong atom - field coupling , recent experimental results indicate that it may actually be observed in situations in which atomic transitions are replaced by transitions between momentum states  @xcite .",
    "this has brought about a renewed interest in the dicke model , mainly for its phase transitions but also because it can present multi - partite entanglement , and can be realized in systems more widely than in the original cavity qed case ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this work we obtain the phase transition of the dicke model for a _ finite _",
    "number @xmath2 of atoms , via @xmath4 different methods : i ) through a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian and the use of the fidelity between neighbouring states ; ii ) through variational test states that are a direct product of coherent heisenberg - weyl ( @xmath5)-states ( for the electromagnetic field ) , and @xmath6-states ( for the atomic field )  @xcite ; and iii ) through the use of projection operators on the coherent states in ( ii ) to obtain states which obey the parity symmetry in the total excitation number , present in the hamiltonian .",
    "all these procedures coincide in the thermodynamic limit @xmath7 .",
    "we show that , for a finite number of atoms , the _ symmetry - adapted _ states ( iii ) constitute a much better approximation to the exact quantum ground- and first excited - states .",
    "( needless to say , the symmetry is also exploited in the numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian . )    for the three cases mentioned above , universal parametric curves are obtained for the expectation values of both the first quadrature of the electromagnetic field , and the atomic relative population , as functions of the atom - field coupling parameter , valid for the ground- and first - excited states .",
    "the dicke hamiltonian involves the collective interaction of @xmath2 two - level atoms , with energy separation @xmath8 , with a one - mode radiation field of frequency @xmath9 , in the long wavelength limit .",
    "it has the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the coupling parameter between the matter and field , are given in units of the frequency of the field , and we have taken @xmath13 .",
    "the operators @xmath14 denote the one - mode creation and annihilation photon operators ; @xmath15 the atomic relative population operator ; and @xmath16 the atomic transition operators .",
    "the energy surface is found by taking the expectation value of the dicke hamiltonian with respect to the tensorial product of coherent states for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 groups @xmath17 , given by  @xcite @xmath18 where the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are complex numbers .",
    "straightforward calculation leads to  @xcite @xmath21 in this expression we use the harmonic oscillator realization for the field variables and the stereographic projection for the angular momentum parameters , @xmath22 where @xmath23 correspond to the expectation values of the quadratures of the field , and @xmath24 determine a point on the bloch sphere .    using the ritz variational principle one finds the best variational approximation to the ground state energy of the system and its corresponding eigenstate .",
    "the minima and degenerate critical points are obtained by means of the catastrophe formalism . for the coherent states we find that when @xmath25 the critical points degenerate",
    "; for this critical value of the field - matter coupling , a phase transition takes place from the normal to the superradiant behavior of the atoms  @xcite .",
    "the critical points which minimize @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows @xmath29 and @xmath30 as a function of @xmath12 , for @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 atoms .",
    "the phase transition is clearly observed at @xmath34 . if we were to use the critical point @xmath35 , the curve describing the quadrature of the radiation field would change sign .    from the relations in eq.([criticos ] ) we obtain , in the superradiant region , @xmath36 this is plotted in fig .",
    "notice that the normal regime is described only by the origin @xmath37 , and that the curve is valid for _ all _ @xmath38 ( as this parameter drops out from eq.([qtheta ] ) ) .",
    "it is also valid for _ any _ number of atoms . as we will show below",
    ", the same curve is obtained for symmetry - adapted variational states as well as for exact quantum solutions ; in this sense the curve is universal .",
    "furthermore , the first - excited states fall along the same path .    the hamiltonian ( [ eq001 ] ) shows a parity symmetry given by @xmath39 = 0\\ ] ] with @xmath40 , the _ total excitation number operator_. this allows for the classification of its eigenstates in terms of the parity of the eigenvalues @xmath41 of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are eigenvalues of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "this allows us to build , through the projection operators @xmath49 , _ symmetry - adapted _ coherent states ( sas ) that preserve the symmetry of the dicke hamiltonian , i.e. , have a definite parity of the total number of excitations .",
    "these are given by  @xcite @xmath50 where the normalization factors @xmath51 are @xmath52    the energy surface associated to sas is given by  @xcite @xmath53 it is straightforward to show that in the thermodynamic limit both surfaces @xmath54 and @xmath55 reduce to eq.([eq003 ] ) .",
    "for a given number of particles @xmath2 and a fixed coupling parameter @xmath12 , we determine the values of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath30 , @xmath58 , where the energy surface for the sas states has its minimum value , in the same manner as done for the coherent states ( cs ) .",
    "the minima of the sas energy surface occurs for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the values of @xmath56 and @xmath30 , which now depend strongly on @xmath2 , are found numerically and they are plotted as a function of @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the even and odd variational states .",
    "the discontinuity in the phase space variable for the even states marks the phase transition .",
    "this phase transition arises from a jump of the global minimum in the even energy surface @xmath61 between two local minima , as @xmath12 varies ; this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where , for three values of @xmath12 crossing the discontinuity , the contour energy levels are plotted as functions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , for @xmath31 .",
    "the jump occurs at @xmath64 for @xmath33 . for the odd state ,",
    "the appearance of a phase transition manifests itself through a change in the concavity of the associated curves for @xmath56 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is useful to compare the minimum points @xmath56 associated to the energy surfaces of the cs and the even sas ( cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the quadrature @xmath56 shows a discontinuity for the latter at the phase transition , as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath12 .",
    "this translates into a forbidden range of values for @xmath30 ( @xmath65 ) when @xmath56 is plotted against it .",
    "note that , in the allowed @xmath63-region , the functions @xmath66 associated to the energy surfaces of the cs and even sas fall along the same curve .",
    "the odd sas state is also plotted , falls along the same curve , has no forbidden regions , and is indistinguishable from that of the coherent state .",
    "since the @xmath56 vs. @xmath30 seems to show a universal behavior , it is convenient to study the exact quantum solution .",
    "we propose the following correspondence between the critical @xmath67 parameters of the classical phase space and the quantum operators : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and the @xmath70 corresponds to @xmath71 . as the system is not integrable ,",
    "we solve numerically the hamiltonian eigenvalue equation for the ground- and first - excited states , separating the even- and odd - parity cases .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the results .",
    "the figure on the left shows , in the vicinity of @xmath72 , the dependence with @xmath12 of the quadrature ( or expectation value of the number operator ) , for @xmath33 ( lower continuous , gray dotted line ) and @xmath73 ( upper continuous , black dotted line ) .",
    "these are compared with those for the sas state at the same values of @xmath2 ( discontinuous , dotted blue lines ) and with the result for the coherent state ( upper continuous cyan line ) .",
    "note that the quantum and sas solutions agree perfectly at @xmath74 , and approximate very well beyond the phase transition .",
    "while the sas plot is discontinuous at the phase transition , the quantum solution shows an inflection point .",
    "the cs agrees beyond @xmath75 , but fails to reproduce the results well enough in the normal region . as @xmath2 increases , @xmath76 ( the value for the coherent state ) , and the jump in the sas curves becomes smaller , the curves approaching more and more its quantum counterparts .",
    "the figure on the right shows the quantum state @xmath56 vs. @xmath30 ( @xmath77 vs. @xmath78 ) behavior for @xmath33 , falling indistiguishably on the universal curve together with the cs and sas states .",
    "the quantum phase transition was found through the fidelity between the state at @xmath79 and the state at @xmath12  @xcite @xmath80 which at the transition acquires its minimum value , by taking @xmath81 ; for @xmath33 we find the transition at @xmath82 , comparing very well with that obtained for the sas states , even for this small @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "another method is to use its second derivative , the so - called _ fidelity susceptibility _ , which , besides pinpointing the phase transition , it allows the determination of the scaling behavior with respect to the number of particles  @xcite .",
    "a universal curve for all values of the coupling parameter @xmath12 and _ any _ number of atoms @xmath2 is obtained for the phase space variables @xmath62 versus @xmath63 , valid for the ground- and first - excited states .",
    "the universal character is irrespective of whether one uses coherent cs states , symmetry - adapted sas states , or the exact quantum solution , even though these quantities are arrived at via very different methods .",
    "the gap in this curve present for the sas states closes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the critical value @xmath72 at which the phase transition occurs is calculated , for the exact solution , by using the fidelity between neighboring states in the coupling strength .",
    "this agrees very well , though not identically , with the critical value given by the sas states .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath33 we find @xmath83 while @xmath84 .",
    "these values become even closer as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this will be studied thoroughly by means of the fidelity susceptibility elsewhere , together with the properties of the ground- and first - excited states _ at _ the phase transition , for a _",
    "finite _ number of atoms .",
    "these results are particularly relevant in atomic physics and quantum optics using superconducting @xmath62-bits  @xcite , where having semi - analytical solutions for small values of @xmath2 is very useful .",
    "while for the coherent states , or mean - field procedure , the phase transition is determined properly only in the thermodynamic limit , for our sas variational states the behavior of both , the ground- and first - excited states , are determined by means of jumps in the phase space variables as functions of the coupling parameter between the electromagnetic field and the matter , and may be calculated for a finite number of particles .",
    "as expected , in the thermodynamic limit all solutions converge to the mean field result .",
