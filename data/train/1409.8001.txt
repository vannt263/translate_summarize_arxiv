    "exploring possible evidence of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in a medium crated in heavy ion collisions is one of the most important and challenging problems @xcite .",
    "experimental studies along this line have been carried out by measuring fluctuations of conserved charges , in particular , of the net baryon number @xcite and the electric charge @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of conserved charges are particularly interesting probes of critical phenomena and phase diagram in qcd .",
    "gthe charge currents couple to the soft `` sigma '' modes , thus correlations and fluctuations of charge densities are directly affected by the chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and net baryon number density @xcite .    for massless two - flavor quarks ,",
    "the qcd phase transition was conjectured to be of the second order , and belonging to the @xmath0 universality class @xcite .",
    "current lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations at physical quark masses show , that at vanishing and small baryon density the transition from a hadron gas to a quark gluon plasma is crossover @xcite .",
    "in addition , lqcd also indicates , that the chiral crossover appears in the critical region of the second order transition belonging to the @xmath3 universality class @xcite .",
    "consequently , observables which are sensitive to criticality related with a spontaneous breaking of a chiral symmetry , in this fluctuations of net baryon number and electric charge , should exhibit characteristic properties governed by the universal part of the free energy density @xcite .",
    "the magnetic equation of states and cumulants of net charges at physical quark masses have been studied in first principle lattice qcd calculations @xcite , as well as in effective chiral models @xcite .",
    "their properties which are obtained beyond mean - field level , have been shown to be consistent with general expectations originating from the @xmath0 scaling .",
    "the above results have opened new opportunity to verify the qcd phase boundary experimentally by measuring fluctuations of conserved charges @xcite , and their probability distributions @xcite .",
    "this is particularly the case , since the chiral pseudocritical line appears near the phenomenological freezeout line  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the hadron resonance gas partition function constitutes the regular part of a free energy density of qcd in a hadronic phase , thus also , a reference for the non - critical behavior of net charge fluctuations and their probability distribution at the phase boundary @xcite .",
    "cumulants of net baryon number fluctuations , quantified by the net protons , have recently been explored in heavy ion collisions by star collaboration @xcite .",
    "the data show deviations from the hrg reference , which are qualitatively consistent with theoretical expectations based on the @xmath0 chiral critical dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the role of different approximations and uncertainties associated with the event - by - event measurements of fluctuations remains to be clarified  @xcite .",
    "in particular , star measurements of the beam energy scan program at the relativistic heavy ion collider , were carried out at midrapidity and within the transverse momentum range @xmath4 gev / c .    the criticality related with the chiral symmetry restoration is dominantly governed by soft momentum modes .",
    "one expects , that produced particles with low momenta , carry information on such soft mometum modes in an interacting medium .",
    "although , there is no direct one - to - one connection between the momentum scale in the interacting medium and the momentum of emitted particles , nevertheless , one expects that imposing cuts on the latter also restricts access to the soft modes .",
    "consequently , cuts imposed on particle momenta can implicitly influence properties of cumulants of conserved charges near phase boundary .",
    "the main objectives of this paper is to study how the momentum cuts can modify critical properties of different cumulants of the net baryon number in the @xmath0 universality class .",
    "our studies are carried out within the quark - meson ( qm ) model . in order to correctly account for the @xmath0 scaling properties of different physical observables near the chiral transition we apply the functional renormalization group ( frg ) method @xcite .",
    "we use the momentum scale dependence of the frg flow equation @xcite to examine how the suppression of the momentum modes in the infrared and ultraviolet regimes modifies generic properties of the net - baryon number fluctuations in the @xmath0 universality class .",
    "we show , that the pion mass @xmath1 is a natural soft momentum scale at which cumulants are saturated at their critical values , whereas for scales larger than @xmath2 the characteristic @xmath0 structure of the higher order cumulants get lost .",
    "we also show , that the restriction of momentum modes in the ultraviolet regime can as well deflect the @xmath0 structure of the net baryon number fluctuations .",
    "our results indicate , that when measuring fluctuations of the net baryon number in heavy ion collisions to search for partial restoration of the chiral symmetry or critical point , a detailed dependence of the results on kinematical cuts has to be examined .    this paper is organized as follows : in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the quark - meson model and its critical properties . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cm ] , we present results on momentum scale dependence of different cumulants and their ratios . section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "we employ the two - flavor quark - meson model to explore the momentum scale dependence of the net quark number flucutations at finite temperature and density .",
    "the quark - meson model is an effective realization of low energy properties of qcd in which chiral symmetry breaking is described by @xmath0 meson multiplet @xmath5 coupled to quark fields @xmath6 with yukawa coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "the qm model lagrangian reads @xmath8q + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\sigma)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\vec{\\pi})^2 - u(\\sigma,\\vec{\\pi}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes the mesonic potential @xmath10 the @xmath0 chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath11 yielding @xmath12 when @xmath13 .",

    ". thus we deal with the 3d system in thermal equilibrium entirely during the scale evolution . in principle",
    ", one can employ an euclidean - invariant form of the regulators by replacing @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "however , such a procedure naturally includes the cutoff also in the matsubara modes which induces various difficulties and the dimensional reduction can be achived only in @xmath42 @xcite . since our main objective is to investigate the influences of the three momentum cut on @xmath0 behavior of fluctuations of the conserved charges , we have not introduced the cut in the matsubara modes . in this way",
    "we avoid the modifications of the thermal medium properties , in particular , its boltzmann momentum distribution .",
    "the flow equation for the scale dependent effective action , includes the two - point function .",
    "formally one can obtain the flow equation for the scale - dependent two - point function by taking the functional derivatives with respect to the fields . as the frg flow includes higher order correlation functions",
    ", the flow equation exhibits an infinite hierarchy , which one needs to truncate to solve it .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath22-scale dependent quantities , the so - called rg trajectory , depends on the choice of the regulator @xmath43 and how to truncate the hierarchy , by construction .    to investigate critical phenomena , which are governed by soft modes , it is convenient to assume , that the field @xmath44 varies slowly",
    ". then , one can put an ansatz for the scale dependent effective action , based on the derivative expansion . to leading order , and ignoring field renormalization",

    "this approximation together with the optimized cutoff function has been shown to produce the @xmath0 criticality in the qm model  @xcite .",

    "in the chiral limit , and at the moderate values of quark chemical potential , the qm model is well known to exhibit the second order phase transition in the @xmath0 universality class which terminates at the critical end point , and then follows as the first order transition . for a physical pion mass",
    "the @xmath0 phase transition is washed out and becomes a smooth crossover .",

    "imposing any momentum cutoffs in such models with skellam function changes the values of different cumulants but preserves their ratios .",
    "these results indicate , that when measuring fluctuations of the net baryon number in heavy ion collisions to search for a restoration of a chiral symmetry or critical point , a special care has to be made when introducing kinematical cuts on the fluctuation measurements .",
    "while there is no direct relation between the kinematical cuts imposed on measured particle momenta and the momentum scale cut in the flow equation , one expects that the low @xmath148 particles are more affected by the soft modes in a medium .",
    "one also finds explicitly , that the scale momentum @xmath22 in the flow equation reduces to the particle momentum in the case of a free gas of quarks and mesons . in turn , this also implies , that one should observe modifications of the higher order cumulants ratios against the variation of the momentum cutoff , if they are influenced by the chiral critical behavior or its remnant .",
