    "it is possible to learn much about a population s history by taking a census of the present - day population . with a large and increasing number of deep",
    ", large - area surveys taking place , a census of the low - redshift galaxy population may be undertaken .",
    "deep imaging allows many different properties to be studied simultaneously .",
    "much can be learned about galaxy formation and evolution by investigating these properties : how they correlate with each other , and the sub - populations that exist .",
    "the advantages of working at low redshift ( @xmath9 ) are as follows : ( 1 ) a more complete sample may be studied , including galaxies with low luminosity or low surface brightness , ( 2 ) the more luminous galaxies may be studied in more depth , investigating morphology and structure as well as luminosity and colour and ( 3 ) the evolution and selection effects that plague high - redshift surveys are less of a problem .    the advantages ( in principle ) of building such a census on near - infrared ( nir ) observations",
    "are well known .",
    "first , mass - to - light ( @xmath10 ) ratios in the nir are largely insensitive to galaxy or stellar type , certainly much less than in the optical @xcite .",
    "this means that the nir light is a good tracer of the total stellar mass in a galaxy .",
    "moreover , the range of @xmath10 ratios is much smaller in the nir , so uncertainties in the stellar mass are much smaller .",
    "not only does this mean that a survey limited in nir magnitude will be approximately limited in ` apparent stellar mass ' , but also that morphological measurements in the nir , for example the srsic index and the half - light radius , will reflect the distribution of stellar mass within the galaxy , whereas such measures in the optical will be significantly biased by the presence of young stellar populations . the @xmath0-band galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is , for these reasons , a convenient quantity for numerical or semi - analytic models to predict : see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a second advantage is that the @xmath0-corrections in the @xmath0 band are also relatively independent of galaxy type , leading to smaller uncertainties in the absolute magnitudes .",
    "a third advantage is that dust is much less of a problem in the nir than in the optical .",
    "this means that , whereas optical measurements of galaxy properties are affected by dust obscuration , and therefore strongly dependent on the inclination of the galaxy , producing a smoothing of the galaxy lf , this is not such a problem in the nir @xcite .    however , the main disadvantage of the nir ( for ground - based telescopes ) is the sky brightness , which is around 13.5magarcsec@xmath11 in @xmath0 for the data used here @xcite .",
    "there have been several studies of the low - redshift @xmath0-band lf using two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) imaging combined with various redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "other estimates have been made by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , using optically selected samples , and by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , using samples selected in the @xmath0 band .",
    "table [ tbl : samplesize ] shows the sample size of these @xmath0-band lf estimates .",
    "an accurate detemination of the local @xmath0-band lf also has great value as a baseline for comparison with studies at higher redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the principal uncertainty remaining at low redshift is connected with the low - luminosity end of the lf .",
    "moreover , there has been significant discussion about possible low - surface - brightness incompleteness in 2mass @xcite , which would affect the low - luminosity end of the lf .",
    ".[tbl : samplesize ] sample sizes of @xmath0-band galaxy luminosity functions . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      @xmath0-corrections ( to @xmath12 ) are estimated using kcorrect v4_1_4 @xcite .",
    "the five optical petrosian magnitudes ( @xmath13 ) , before the evolution corrections have been applied ( see below ) , are used to fit galaxy templates to each galaxy , from which the @xmath0-correction is derived in @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "wfcam filter files have been generated from @xcite . due to the inconsistent petrosian apertures between ukidss and sdss bands",
    ", we do not have good optical ",
    "nir galaxy colours and so we have not been able to use the full set of bands ( @xmath14 ) for the template fitting .",
    "when covering a significant range in redshift , it is important to include evolution corrections .",
    "this is because the bright end of the lf will consist mainly of galaxies at high redshift , while the faint end will be made up from galaxies at low redshift .",
    "a failure to include evolution corrections leads to a distortion in the shape of the luminosity function .",
    "evolution corrections are applied using a simple @xmath15 , where @xmath16 in @xmath13 is taken from @xcite and we take @xmath17 in @xmath0 ( consistent with stellar population synthesis models , * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.2 ) , i.e.  @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "note that these evolution corrections are very simplistic , since different kinds of galaxies evolve in different ways , but the correction is small : at @xmath20 , the @xmath0-band evolution correction is @xmath21mag .",
    "absolute magnitudes are given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the distance modulus and @xmath24 is the @xmath0-correction .",
    "absolute surface brightness , in magarcsec@xmath11 , is given by @xmath25 note that in the @xmath0 band , for all galaxies in the sample , the absolute surface brightness is not more than 0.5mag brighter than the apparent surface brightness . @xmath0- and evolution - corrections",
    "are not applied when estimating the physical radius , which is given in @xmath26kpc as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angular size in arcsec and @xmath29 is the angular diameter distance in @xmath26mpc .",
    "[ kecorr ] shows the @xmath0- and evolution - corrections in the @xmath0 band and @xmath1 band , also showing the @xmath0-band corrections used by @xcite .",
    "their @xmath0-corrections are stronger than those used here , but their value of @xmath30 is weaker than our value . these two largely cancel each other out , with our @xmath31 being approximately the same as theirs for low redshift .",

    "this inclination - dependent dust attenuation would ideally require good bulge - to - disc decomposition , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we choose here to present results that are not corrected for dust , thus representing the amount of @xmath0-band light that escapes from the galaxy , rather than the amount of @xmath0-band light emitted by the stars in the galaxy ( some of which will be absorbed by dust ) .",
    "however , in estimating the absolute magnitude of a galaxy we have implicitly assumed isotropic emission of light , which is not the case : a disc galaxy will appear fainter when viewed edge - on than when viewed face - on , leading to a corresponding under- or over - estimate , respectively , of the galaxy s total ( attenuated ) luminosity .",
    "this will lead to a blurring of the lf for disc galaxies , but less so than at optical wavelengths .",
    "in a survey limited by more than one measured quantity , e.g.  two magnitudes , or magnitude and surface brightness , there are two ways to proceed .",
    "one is explicitly to take into account all of the known selection effects .",
    "the other is to set strong limits in one or more quantities so that the selection effects in the remaining quantities are negligible .",
    "either of these ensures that completeness is taken into account and that the contribution of each observed galaxy to the total space density is estimated accurately ( by @xmath2 ) .",
    "there are three traditional methods for estimating the lf .",
    "if the functional form of the lf is known , the best method to use is the sty @xcite maximum likelihood method .",
    "but in this work the space density is a four - dimensional distribution and the functional form is unknown , so the sty method can not be used .",
    "the other two methods have no prior assumptions about the functional form .",
    "these are the stepwise maximum likelihood ( swml ) method @xcite , a version of the sty method where the functional form is described by a value in each bin , and the @xmath2 method @xcite , which is a simple estimator of the value of the space density in each bin .",
    "the swml method works by factoring out the normalization at each redshift and matching the shape of the lf across different redshifts .",
    "it is therefore less prone to clustering effects than the @xmath2 method , which assumes a homogeneous distribution , but it ( like the sty method ) does not give a value for the overall normalization , which must be determined by other means .",
    "however , the bins in the swml method are strongly correlated , so any problem in the swml estimation is likely to affect the entire luminosity function .",
    "the @xmath2 estimator is more robust against systemic failure , but requires a large survey volume in order to overcome the effects of large - scale structure .    in this work , due to the complexity of the four - dimensional space",
    ", we have found the swml method to be prone to fail , whereas the @xmath2 method has proved to be more stable .",
    "large - scale structure has not been taken into account , but a large volume has been probed at bright luminosities and faint luminosities are already affected by incompleteness at low surface brightness .",
    "the volume within which each galaxy would be visible , @xmath34 , is estimated for each galaxy by considering the tightest constraints on maximum and minimum redshift provided by the limits in @xmath35 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath0-band @xmath36 and @xmath0-band petrosian radius . each galaxy",
    "is then given a weight @xmath37 .",
    "the space density @xmath38 of galaxies of a certain type ( e.g. , binned in absolute magnitude and/or surface brightness ) is given by @xmath39 for galaxies @xmath40 of that type .",
    "the effect of the @xmath41 factors on the features of the @xmath0-band lf may be appreciated by comparing the shape of the absolute magnitude histogram in fig .",
    "[ zhist ] with the shape of the lf in fig .",
    "[ lf ] . for galaxies with higher luminosity ,",
    "@xmath34 is considerably greater , so the effect of the weighting on the shape of the curve is to raise the faint end relative to the bright end .",
    "it may also be seen that the @xmath2 weighting introduces no obviously spurious features into the final lf , despite the complexity of the limits on the sample .",
    "some regions of the four - dimensional parameter space have not been sampled , for example , low - surface brightness galaxies , so care needs to be taken when interpreting the binned space density .",
    "statistical errors for all quantities ( except where indicated ) are estimated through the jackknife method @xcite .",
    "the sample area is divided into 24 regions , each containing approximately the same number of galaxies ; the principal subdivisions are shown in fig .  [ coverage ] .",
    "the space density is calculated once for the whole sample and then a further 24 times , each time omitting one of the 24 regions .",
    "the variance of each value of @xmath38 is then calculated using : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath40th jackknife resampling of the data and @xmath44 is the number of jackknife resamplings ( 24 in this case ) . a bias correction @xcite is applied to the space density , giving a new value of @xmath45 where @xmath38 is the original estimate for the whole sample .",
    "uncertainties and bias corrections for the functional fits and integrated quantities ( for example , luminosity density ) are estimated using the same method .",
    "it would be preferable , but more difficult , to divide the sample into regions of equal area rather than equal numbers of galaxies .",
    "given the way in which the effective area is calculated , these subdivisions can not say anything about the overall normalization of the space density ; for example , whether the south galactic pole has a lower density of galaxies than the north galactic pole .",
    "uncertainties in the magnitudes and other galaxy properties are not included in the analysis .",
    "this is likely to have only a small effect on most of our results , but the magnitude errors will cause us slightly to overestimate the space density of galaxies at the bright end of the luminosity function , where the lf is very steep @xcite .",
