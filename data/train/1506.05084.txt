    "topological superconductors attract our attention in part because they often host unpaired majorana zero modes @xcite . these in turn exhibit a number of intriguing physical properties , including a possibility to encode quantum information in a way that is robust to environmental decoherence @xcite as well as to perform a limited set of quantum gates that are topologically protected @xcite .",
    "thus far experimental evidence for majorana zero modes ( mzms ) exists in quasi one - dimensional systems including semiconductor quantum wires @xcite and wires composed of magnetic adatoms on a superconducting surface @xcite .",
    "2d heterostructures made of strong topological insulators ( sti ) and conventional superconductors ( sc ) are beginning to also show promise @xcite .",
    "the latter systems are predicted to host unpaired mzms in cores of abrikosov vortices @xcite and the quantum information stored in the zero mode subspace can be manipulated by performing adiabatic exchanges ",
    "`` braiding'' of the individual vortices .",
    "how exactly one performs such braiding operations , initializes the system and reads out the resulting quantum state remains largely an open question but is one of considerable interest .",
    "a necessary first step towards the long term goal of storing and manipulating quantum information in the hilbert space spanned by mzms bound to vortex cores is to understand and characterize these systems from the point of view of their electronic structure . with this goal in mind",
    "we investigate here the electronic structure of topological superconductors in the presence of abrikosov vortex lattices , paying particular attention to the fate of the mzms associated with individual vortices . specifically , we study two different models of electrons in a 2d topological superconductor in the presence of a periodic vortex lattice .",
    "one describes a 2d spin polarized @xmath0 superconductor and the other a sc surface of a 3d sti , also known as the fu - kane model @xcite .",
    "although not explicitly studied here , we expect our results to apply to other realizations of 2d topological superconductors , such as those predicted to occur in heterostructures combining spin - orbit coupled semiconductors , ferromagnetic insulators and ordinary superconductors @xcite . because of the interplay between the orbital effects of the applied magnetic field @xmath2 that is necessary to establish the vortex lattice and the spatially varying phase field @xmath3 of the sc order parameter this turns out to be a problem of considerable subtlety and complexity . a variant of this problem in the @xmath0 superconductor and an @xmath4-wave sc with rashba spin - orbit coupling , but _ neglecting _",
    "the applied magnetic field , has been studied in recent works @xcite .",
    "it is however well known @xcite that the vortex lattice is thermodynamically unstable in the absence of @xmath2 .",
    "( it is analogous to a system of charged particles without an appropriate neutralizing background . )    to understand the electronic structure of a physical vortex lattice the magnetic field must be properly included .",
    "we do this here using a technique of the singular gauge transformation @xcite first developed in the context of high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors with @xmath6-wave symmetry and subsequently applied to both @xmath4- and @xmath7-wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "the chief advantage of this technique is that it treats the magnetic field @xmath2 and the sc phase field @xmath3 on an equal footing .",
    "indeed we find results for low - energy majorana modes that differ in several important aspects from the results of refs .",
    "@xcite obtained while neglecting the @xmath2 field .",
    "most notably the flat majorana bands predicted in ref.@xcite and the strong band structure anisotropies seen in ref .",
    "@xcite are not present in the full solution of the problem .",
    "we conclude that magnetic field must be included in any calculation that aims to correctly capture the physics of majorana zero modes in a realistic , thermodynamically stable vortex lattice .",
    "we note that semiclassical treatment of a @xmath0 superconductor has recently been carried out ( including the @xmath2 field ) @xcite and showed results consistent with our fully quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows . denoting a majorana zero mode operator associated with a vortex core positioned at @xmath8 by @xmath9",
    "we find that in the presence of the vortex lattice the physics of these modes is well described by a tight binding model of the form @xmath10 here @xmath11 can be decoposed into a real symmetric matrix @xmath12 representing the hopping strength while @xmath13 are z@xmath1 gauge factors .",
    "the imaginary unity present in the latter is dictated by the majorana commutation relations @xmath14 and the requirement that @xmath15 be hermitian .",
    "the sign ambiguity in @xmath16 arises from the fact that one can perform a local z@xmath1 gauge transformation @xmath17 without affecting the zero mode commutation algebra ( [ can2 ] ) . a product of @xmath18 factors along a closed path ,",
    "however , represents a z@xmath1 gauge flux that is gauge invariant , and therefore in principle observable .",
    "it is fixed by the microscopic hamiltonian and can be thought of as analogous to the magnetic flux expressed through peierls factors in lattice models of charged particles .",
    "our main finding is that for the mzms in the vortex lattice the z@xmath1 gauge flux through a general polygon formed by @xmath19 vortices is given by the grosfeld - stern rule @xcite @xmath20 previously derived for mzms in the moore - read fractional quantum hall state @xcite , whose effective theory is analogous to the spin polarized @xmath0 superconductor .",
    "( [ kin2 ] ) indicates a non - zero z@xmath1 gauge flux @xmath21 and @xmath22 through an elementary triangular and square plaquette , respectively , of the majorana lattice .",
    "this in turn implies that the gapped phases of the hamiltonian ( [ kin1 ] ) are typically topologically non - trivial with the occupied bands characterized by a non - zero chern number .",
    "we note that the majorana tight - binding model eq .",
    "( [ kin1 ] ) has been previously derived @xcite for vortex lattices present in the kitaev spin model on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured in these works that similar results should apply to other systems supporting localized majorana mode arrays , but this conjecture has not yet been verified .",
    "our work shows that the tight - binding model eq .",
    "( [ kin1 ] ) with the z@xmath1 gauge structure ( [ kin2 ] ) does apply to abrikosov lattices in @xmath7-wave superconductors and the sc surfaces of topological insulators .",
    "when the applied magnetic field is well below the upper critical field @xmath23 we furthermore find that the hopping amplitudes @xmath12 are significant only between the first and second nearest neighbors ( nn ) .",
    "more generally , @xmath12 preserve all vortex lattice symmetries and exhibit an exponential decay @xmath24 with the distance @xmath25 and @xmath26 the sc coherence length , superimposed on the rkky - type oscillation with a period close to the fermi momentum @xmath27 of the underlying normal metal .",
    "as already mentioned we find no sign of flat bands resulting from a subset of vanishing @xmath12 predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite or anisotropies that break the underlying vortex lattice symmetry predicted in ref .",
    "these effects appear to be artifacts introduced by an approximation that neglects the magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "they may be present in small clusters of vortices if such can be stabilized in the absence of @xmath2 but are not characteristic of a physical vortex lattice that retains its stability in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the results described above pertain to both the @xmath0 superconductor and the fu - kane model .",
    "the latter shows an additional interesting feature when tuned to the neutrality point , reached when the chemical potential @xmath28 of the sti coincides with the dirac point of the surface state . as noted previously @xcite",
    ", the model then exhibits an additional `` chiral '' symmetry which changes the topological classification of its zero modes from z@xmath1 to z. physically , this means that in the fu - kane model at neutrality mzm hybridization is prohibited and the majorana band must remain flat irrespective of the geometry of the vortex lattice .",
    "we confirm by explicit numerical calculation that this is indeed the case .",
    "we also find that when slightly detuned from neutrality mzms form a weakly dispersive band with a narrow bandwidth proportional to the chemical potential @xmath28 measured relative to the dirac point .",
    "the majorana flat band obtained by tuning a single parameter constitutes an interesting system because , just like in the fractional quantum hall liquids @xcite , the kinetic energy of the particles becomes quenched and the nature of the ground state is determined by interactions or disorder effects . if the sample is sufficiently clean so that disorder can be neglected and when interactions are present the system is inherently strongly correlated .",
    "some consequences of these strong interactions in various 1d and 2d vortex lattice geometries have been explored in recent studies @xcite .",
    "effects of disorder on the majorana tight - binding model eq .",
    "( [ kin1 ] ) have also been studied by several groups and interesting disorder - induced phases have been found @xcite .",
    "majorana zero modes associated with the individual vortices in @xmath0 superconductor and the fu - kane model have been amply discussed in the literature @xcite . in this section",
    "we give a brief overview of some key results and then focus on the effect of the applied magnetic field on the collective behavior of the zero modes in such lattices . using approximate analytical techniques",
    "we show how the low - energy hamiltonian ( [ kin1 ] ) emerges in this setting and give expressions for the overlap integrals @xmath12 and the z@xmath1 gauge factors @xmath18 valid in a physical vortex lattice that includes the magnetic field .",

    "[ fig1 ] , it is possible to determine the gauge invariant phase factors @xmath86 without resorting to detailed calculations .",
    "one can argue in two stages .",
    "first , consider a closed path @xmath124 indicated in fig .",
    "it consists of straight line segments and circular segments . in the following",
    "we shall consider the latter to have infinitesimal radii .",
    "the integral @xmath125 can be seen to equal @xmath126 as the path encircles two vortices each contributing flux @xmath110 plus an area pierced by magnetic flux @xmath127 contributing @xmath128 to the integral .",
    "it is also easy to see that the circular segments of the path alone contribute the same amount of flux @xmath126 .",
    "this shows that the total contribution of the straight line segments must be zero . on symmetry grounds we furthermore expect each straight segment to give the same contribution which must therefore be zero .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached by considering another path , such as @xmath129 , indicating that this result is consistent .",
    "we thus arrive at a simple recipe for finding @xmath86 : straight line segments contribute zero while the circular segments contribute a phase @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the angular length of the segment and the sign depends on the sense of rotation with the @xmath132 sign taken for counterclockwise rotation .",
    "second , we must attend to the branch cuts . to motivate this",
    "consider the path @xmath133 in fig .",

    "this ambiguity has to do with the fact that @xmath86 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ x2 ] ) has an overall factor of @xmath136 in front of the phase gradient which makes @xmath137 non - single valued in the presence of vortices .",
    "importantly , this non - single valuedness underlies the z@xmath1 gauge structure present in the tight binding model ( [ kin1 ] ) . in order to produce a consistent low - energy theory for the mzms",
    "we must specify @xmath86 in a globally unique fashion .",
    "this is achieved by defining branch cuts , emanating one from each vortex , along which @xmath108 varies discontinuously .",
    "it is most convenient to choose the branch cuts such that they terminate in a nearby vortex .",
    "one such choice of the branch cuts is illustrated by dashed lines in fig .",
    "integration paths between points @xmath85 and @xmath8 chosen so as not to cross any branch cuts then furnish a globally unique definition of @xmath86 which corresponds to a particular choice of the z@xmath1 gauge .",

    "the latter property follows from the non - zero gauge flux implied by the grosfeld - stern phase factors .",
    "these , in turn , originate from the structure of the individual mzm wavefunctions and their overlap integrals .",
    "an intuitive understanding of this structure can be obtained from the following simple argument . because of the self - adjoint property ( [ can2 ] ) of the mzm operators and their fermionic anticommutation relations the hopping amplitude between two sites is necessarily imaginary .",

    "this expectation is indeed borne out by our analytical as well as numerical calculations .",
    "such completely flat bands are then highly susceptible to the effects of interactions and disorder . some of the interaction and disorder effects have been explored in recent works @xcite and found various interesting interacting phases of majorana zero modes in one and two dimensions .    in a homogeneous superconductor the vortex lattice",
    "is expected to be perfectly periodic @xcite and our results then directly apply .",
    "many clean superconductors indeed exhibit such perfectly periodic vortex lattices . in a disordered superconductor ,",
    "however , vortex lattice itself may become disordered .",

    "however , our results indicate that the effective majorana tight - binding model eq .",
    "( [ kin1 ] ) provides a good description of the low - energy physics .",
    "one thus expects that majorana degrees of freedom in a disordered vortex lattice will be well described by the same tight - binding model in which the overlap integrals @xmath74 acquire a random component .",
    "randomness in this model has been extensively studied @xcite and we expect these results to directly transfer to the present problem of vortex lattices with randomness .",
    "in addition , in a 2d system individual vortices can undergo thermal or quantum fluctuations around their equilibrium positions .",
    "the fate of the energy bands in this situation is an interesting problem which we leave for future study .",
    "recently , individual vortices have been experimentally observed by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) in 2d heterostructures combining a topological insulator bi@xmath1te@xmath230 and a conventional superconductor nbse@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "evidence for possible mzms bound in the cores of such vortices has also been reported @xcite . although these experiments were not performed in the parameter regime where the mzm band formation could be directly observed these developments suggest that the results obtained in the present work can be experimentally tested in the near future .",
