    "during the heteroepitaxial growth of thin films , the evolution of the crystal surfaces involves various structures .",
    "below the roughening transition temperature , the crystal surface can be well characterized as steps and terraces , together with adatoms on the terraces .",
    "adatoms detach from steps , diffuse on the terraces until they meet one of the steps and reattach again , which lead to a step flow on the crystal surface .",
    "the evolution of individual steps is described mathematically by the burton - cabrera - frank ( bcf ) type models @xcite ; see @xcite for extensions to include elastic effects .",
    "denote the step locations at time @xmath3 by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the index of the steps .",
    "denote the height of each step as @xmath6 .",
    "for one dimensional vicinal surface , if we do not consider the deposition flux , the original bcf type model , after non - dimensionalization , can be written as ( we set some physical constants to be @xmath7 for simplicity ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the terrace diffusion constant , @xmath10 is the hopping rate of an adatom to the upward or downward step , and @xmath11 is the chemical potential whose expression ranges under different assumption . often two limiting cases of the classical bcf type model were considered .",
    "see @xcite for diffusion - limited ( dl ) case and see @xcite for attachment - detachment - limited ( adl ) case .    in dl regime ,",
    "the dominated dynamics is diffusion across the terraces , i.e. @xmath12 , so the step - flow ode becomes @xmath13    in adl regime , the diffusion across the terraces is fast , i.e. @xmath14 , so the dominated processes are the exchange of atoms at steps edges , i.e. , attachment and detachment .",
    "the step - flow ode in adl regime becomes @xmath15    those models are widely used for crystal growth of thin films on substrates ; see many scientific and engineering applications in the books @xcite .",
    "as many of the film s properties and performances originate in their growth processes , understanding and mastering thin film growth is one of the major challenges of materials science .",
    "although these mesoscopic models provide details of discrete nature , continuum approximation for the discrete models is also used to analyze the step motion because they involve fewer variables than discrete models and briefly show the evolution of step flow .",
    "many interesting continuum models can be found in the literature on surface morphological evolution ; see @xcite for one dimensional models and @xcite for two dimensional models .",
    "the study of relation between the discrete ode models and the corresponding continuum pde has raised lots of interest . driven by this goal , it is important to understand the well - posedness and properties of the solutions to those continuum models .    for a general surface with peaks and valleys , the analysis of step motion",
    "is complicated so we focus on a simpler situation in this work : a monotone one - dimensional step train . in this case ,",
    "ozdemir , zangwill @xcite and al hajj shehadeh , kohn and weare @xcite realized using the step slope as a new variable is a convenient way to derive the continuum pde model @xmath16 where @xmath1 , considered as a function of step height @xmath2 , is the step slope of the surface .",
    "we validate this continuum model by formulating a notion of weak solution .",
    "then we prove the existence of a weak solution .",
    "indeed , the weak solution is also persistent , i.e. , it is positive ( or negative ) almost everywhere if non - negative ( or non - positive ) initial data are assumed .",
    "the starting point of this pde is the 1d attachment - detachment - limited ( adl ) type models . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we will consider a periodic train of steps in this work , i.e. , we assume that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a fixed length of the period .",
    "thus , only the step locations in one period @xmath19 are considered as degrees of freedom .",
    "since the vicinal surface is very large in practice from the microscopic point of view , this is a good approximation .",
    "we set the height of each step as @xmath20 , and thus the total height changes across the @xmath21 steps in one period is given by @xmath7 .",
    "this choice is suitable for the continuum limit @xmath22 .",
    "see figure 1 for an example of step train in one period .",
    "the general form of the ( free ) energy functional due to step interaction is @xmath23 where @xmath24 reflects the physics of step interaction .",
    "following the convention in focusing on entropic and elastic - dipoles interaction @xcite , we choose @xmath25 .",
    "hence each step evolves by with chemical potential @xmath26 defined as the first variation of the step interaction energy @xmath27 with respect to @xmath28 that is @xmath29 from the periodicity of @xmath30 in , it is easy to see the periodicity of @xmath11 such that @xmath31    when the step height @xmath32 or equivalently , the number of steps in one period @xmath33 , from the viewpoint of surface slope , al hajj shehadeh , kohn and weare @xcite and margetis , nakamura @xcite studied the continuum model ; see also @xcite for physical derivation in general case .",
    "we recall their ideas in our periodic setup .",
    "denote the step slopes as @xmath34 the periodicity of @xmath30 in directly implies the periodicity of @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 then by straight - forward calculation , we have the ode for slopes @xmath37.\\ ] ] under the periodic setup , when considering step slope @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 in continuum model , @xmath1 has period @xmath7 .",
    "keep in mind the height of each step @xmath30 is @xmath38 it is natural to anticipate that as @xmath39 the solution of the slope ode should converge to the solution @xmath40 of continuum model , which is 1-periodic with respect to step height @xmath2 .    by different methods , @xcite and @xcite separately studied the self - similar solution of ode and pde . for monotone initial data , i.e. @xmath41 , @xcite proved the steps do not collide and the global - in - time solution to ode ( as well as ode ) was obtained in their paper . by introducing a similarity variable , @xcite first discovered that the self - similar solution is a critical point of a `` similarity energy '' , for both discrete and continuum system .",
    "then they rigorously prove the continuum limit of self - similar solution and obtained the convergence rate for self - similar solution . however , as far as we know , the global - in - time validation of the time - dependent continuum limit model is still an open question as stated in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is not even known whether has a well - defined , unique solution .",
    "although the positivity of solution to continuum model corresponds to the non - collision of steps in discrete model , which was proved in @xcite ; even a `` formal proof '' of positive global weak solution in the time - dependent continuous setting has not been established .",
    "our goal is to formulate a notion of weak solution and prove the existence of global weak solution .",
    "we also prove the almost everywhere positivity of the solution , which might help the study of global convergence of discrete model to its continuum limit in the future .",
    "moreover , we study the long time behavior of weak solutions and prove that all weak solutions converge to a constant as time goes to infinity .",
    "the space - time hlder continuity of the solution is also obtained .",
    "one of the main difficulties for pde is that it becomes degenerate - parabolic whenever @xmath1 approaches @xmath42 .",
    "as it is not known if solutions have singularities on the set @xmath43 or not , we adopt a regularization method , @xmath44-system , from the work of bernis and friedman @xcite .",
    "first , we define weak solution in the spirit of @xcite",
    ". then we study the @xmath44-system and obtain an unique global weak solution to @xmath44-system .",
    "the positive lower bound of solution to @xmath44-system is important in the proof of existence of almost everywhere positive weak solution to pde . observing the energy dissipation rate @xmath45 defined in and the corresponding variational structure",
    ", we will make the natural choice of using @xmath46 as the variable .",
    "yet another difficulty arises since we do not have lower - order estimate for @xmath46 after regularization .",
    "therefore we need to adopt the _ a - priori _ assumption method and verify the _ a - priori _ assumption by calculating the positive lower bound of solutions to @xmath44-system . finally , we prove the limit of solution to @xmath44-system is the weak solution to .",
    "while we prove the existence , the uniqueness of the weak solution is still an open question .",
    "since we consider a degenerate problem not in divergence form , we have not been able to show the uniqueness after the solution touches zero , nor can we obtain any kind of conservation laws rigorously .",
    "one of the closely related models is the continuum model in dl regime ( we set some physical constants to be @xmath7 for simplicity ) @xmath47 which was first proposed by xiang @xcite , who considered dl type model with a different chemical potential @xmath26 .",
    "more specifically , an additional contribution from global step interaction is included besides the local terms in the free energy , @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . while the free energy @xmath51 is slightly different from that of @xcite , where the first term @xmath52 is also treated as a global interaction , the formal continuum limit pde are the same .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the second term @xmath53 comes from the misfit elastic interaction between steps , and is hence higher - order in @xmath6 compared with the broken bond elastic interaction between steps which contributes to the first term .",
    "note that is a pde for the height of the surface as a function of the position and the first two terms involve the small parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we include in the appendix some alternative forms of the pde .",
    "in particular , when formally ignoring these terms with small @xmath6-dependent amplitude , becomes @xmath54 which is parallel to in our case .",
    "for the dl type pde , a fully rigorous understanding is available in @xcite .",
    "kohn @xcite pointed out that a rigorous understanding for the evolution of global solution to adl type model ( as well as pde ) is still open because the mobility @xmath55 in ( which equals @xmath7 in dl model ) brings more difficulties .    recently , dal maso , fonseca and leoni @xcite studied the global weak solution to by setting @xmath56 in the equation , i.e. , @xmath57 the work @xcite validated analytically by verifying the almost everywhere positivity of @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , fonseca , leoni and lu @xcite obtained the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution to .",
    "however , also because the mobility @xmath55 ( which equals @xmath7 in dl model ) appears when the pde is rewritten as @xmath2-equation , there is little chance to recast it into a maximal monotone operator form by choosing other variables , which is the key to the method in @xcite .",
    "therefore we use different techniques following bernis and friedman @xcite and the uniqueness is still open .    the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] establishes two variational structures of pde , both useful in our analysis . after defining the weak solution , section [ sec3 ]",
    "is devoted to prove the main theorem [ global_th ] . in section [ sec3.1 ]",
    ", we establish the well - posedness of the regularized @xmath44-system and study its properties . in section [ sec3.2 ] , we study the existence of global weak solution to pde and prove it is positive almost everywhere . in section [ sec3.3 ] , we obtain the space - time hlder continuity of the weak solution .",
    "section [ sec4 ] considers the long time behavior of weak solution .",
    "the paper ends with appendix which include a few alternative formulations of the pdes based on other physical variables than the slope .",
    "in this section , we establish two variational structures for pde for different energy functionals .",
    "one is the usual free energy @xmath59 and the other one is the energy dissipation rate @xmath45 .",
    "both of them are important for proving the existence of weak solution to .",
    "we also give a formal observation for the conservation law of @xmath60 in the end of this section .",
    "define the free energy of pde as @xmath61 which is consistent with the discrete energy @xmath51 defined in .",
    "then we have @xmath62 and can be recast as @xmath63 it is easy to calculate that @xmath64      denote another energy functional for as @xmath65 ^ 2 { \\,\\mathrm{d}}h,\\ ] ] which was introduced in the work @xcite .",
    "we call it energy dissipation rate due to its physical meaning .",
    "in fact , from , we know @xmath66 thus @xmath45 gives the rate at which the step free energy @xmath59 is dissipated up to a constant .",
    "it will be used to study the positivity and existence of weak solution to .",

    "although it is only formal , the conservation law gives the intuition to prove the strict positivity of weak solution to regularized problem .",
    "multiplying by @xmath70 gives @xmath71 hence we know @xmath72 is constant of motion .",
