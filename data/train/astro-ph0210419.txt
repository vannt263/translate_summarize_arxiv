    "our group ( p.i . :",
    "m.kissler-patig ) started a campaign to obtain high s / n spectra of representative globular clusters in early - type galaxies .",
    "this work will form the bulk of thomas h.  puzia s phd thesis and be used in combination with optical / nir photometry in maren hempel s phd thesis .",
    "so far , we have obtained intermediate - resolution spectra ( r@xmath1800 ) of globular clusters in six early - type galaxies using the fors2/mxu instrument attached to eso s vlt .",
    "these data are complemented by spectra of the host galaxy s integrated light out to large radii ( 2 - 3 r@xmath2 ) .",
    "our sample covers galaxies with various properties : from bright ( @xmath3 mag ) and faint ( @xmath4 mag ) galaxies , located in the field , in groups , and in clusters .",
    "the aim is to study the chemical composition of globular clusters in order to understand the formation and evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "in particular , we are investigating age differences within a galaxy , are looking for differences in ages / metallicities between bright / faint and cluster / field galaxies ; and are comparing the line indices of the globular clusters with the ones for the corresponding integrated light at comparable radii .    here ,",
    "we presents first results for 4 galaxies :    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the best age indicators in the lick system remain the balmer lines . among these",
    ", h@xmath5 is mostly used , but is super - seeded in diagnostic quality by h@xmath6 for good data ( see puzia s contribution in these proceedings ) .",
    "the balmer line needs to be plotted against an @xmath0-element insensitive index ( e.g.  [ mgfe ] ) otherwise any derived age is a function of the @xmath0-enrichment of that particular globular cluster .     plotted against [ mgfe ] ]    fig .",
    "[ fig_age ] shows h@xmath6 plotted against [ mgfe ] for all studied globular clusters in the four galaxies .",
    "we compare our data to the latest ssp model grid of maraston et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for ages 0.815 gyr and metallicities @xmath7 to + 0.6 dex .",
    "open symbols represent globular clusters formally younger than 3 gyr .",
    "using the lick indices , we can probe 1 ) the total metallicity , best traced by [ mgfe ] , a combination of mg and two fe indices that result in a fairly @xmath0-element independent quantity ; and 2 ) the @xmath0-element ratio , well traced by comparing fe and mg .",
    "the total metallicity traces the overall chemical enrichment during the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "as expected from photometric studies , we observe in all galaxies a wide spread in metallicity ranging from [ fe / h]@xmath8 dex to solar or above .",
    "plotted against @xmath9fe@xmath10    fig .",
    "[ fig_met ] shows mg@xmath11 plotted against @xmath9fe@xmath12 as diagnostic for @xmath0-element enrichment .",
    "the mg@xmath11 index traces the strength of the mg ( @xmath0 element ) absorption feature at 5180  .",
    "the @xmath9fe@xmath12 index is a composite index of two line indices fe5335 and fe5270 which trace the strength of strong iron lines at around 5300  .",
    "the iso - metallicity lines show ssp model predictions computed for three @xmath0/fe ratios ( solar , @xmath13 dex , @xmath14 dex ) assuming a 13 gyr old stellar population ( thomas et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the lines range from -2.25 dex ( lower left ) up to + 0.67 dex ( upper right ) in metallicity .",
    "open symbols show clusters formally younger than 3 gyr ( see fig .  [ fig_age ] ) .",
    "* the most striking feature of the age - metallicity plot is the fact that the globular clusters with metallicities below [ fe / h]@xmath15 span a very narrow age range around the @xmath112 gyr isochrone , i.e.  comparable to milky way halo clusters . for metallicities above [ fe / h]@xmath15 dex , the globular clusters show a large spread in ages over several gyr . in particular ,",
    "a significant number of intermediate - age clusters appear to be present ( the ratio old to intermediate varying from galaxy to galaxy ) .",
    "a caveat to the latter interpretation might be the influence of fluctuations of the horizontal branch morphology .",
    "however , the spectroscopic intermediate - ages seem confirmed by optical - nir photometry ( puzia et al .",
    "2002 , hempel et al .",
    "2002 , see also hempel et al .  in these proceedings ) .",
    "* the clusters in all galaxies span a similar metallicity range as in the milky way .",
    "we found neither super metal - poor nor obvious super metal - rich clusters .",
    "* in all galaxies , the metal - rich clusters ( [ fe / h]@xmath16 dex ) span a wide range of [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios indicating a large variety of formation time scales within a single galaxy .",
    "interestingly , the intermediate - age globular clusters appear to have , on average , lower [ @xmath0/fe ] values than the old clusters . while the bulk of the intermediate - age clusters has ratios close to solar , the old metal - rich clusters tend to be @xmath0-element enriched , similar the diffuse stellar light of the host galaxies ."
