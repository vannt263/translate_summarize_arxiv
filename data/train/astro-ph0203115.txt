    "long term cyclic period changes are a fairly common phenomenon in close binary systems . these changes have been observed in algols , rs canum venaticorum and w ursae majoris binaries , and they are suspected to be present in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ( hall 1989 ; hall & kreiner 1980 ; hobart et al .",
    "1994 ; warner 1988 ) .",
    "researchers have found it difficult to quantify this phenomenon because precise measurements extending over decades are required .",
    "the traditional manner in which period changes are investigated is through the construction of a plot of the difference between a binary s @xmath2 and @xmath3 times of primary eclipse versus time .",
    "this plot is referred to as an o@xmath1c diagram .",
    "@xcite estimate that the median modulation period seen in these diagrams is 40 - 50 years for algol and rs cvn systems while for cvs this value varies from years to decades .",
    "the amplitudes of these waveforms are also small having @xmath4 for cvs , @xmath5 for w uma binaries , and @xmath6 algols and rs cvns .",
    "although the physical cause for these variations is not known , the similar appearance of the o@xmath1c diagrams for several classes of close binaries suggests that a common mechanism produces them .",
    "several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the cyclic period changes in close binaries .",
    "apsidal motion , which involves a change in the orientation of the binary s major axis , is an unlikely mechanism because close binaries possess circular orbits and this phenomenon only occurs in systems having large eccentricities . if apsidal motion were present , the times for secondary and primary minima",
    "would be shifted in opposite directions , but this effect is rarely seen and does not appear to be present in algols .",
    "an alternate possibility is that the cyclic pattern in the o@xmath1c plot is caused by the presence of a third body .",
    "this idea has been explored by several investigators , most recently by @xcite .",
    "these researchers postulate that the motion of the binary around the center of mass of a triple system causes the primary and secondary eclipse times to vary in a uniform and periodic fashion . in this case",
    ", the cyclic o@xmath1c pattern arises from orbital induced changes in the distance to the observer .",
    "finally , @xcite noted that , for algols which possess alternating period increases and decreases , the spectral types of the secondaries are always in the range late f to k. these stars have outer convective zones and , if they are rapidly rotating , a magnetic dynamo is produced @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used this information to develop a theory to explain the cyclic shape of the o@xmath1c curves of these systems .",
    "they suggest that if the secondary is deformed by tidal and centrifugal forces , changes in the internal rotation associated with a magnetic activity cycle alter the star s gravitational quadrupole moment .",
    "as the quadrupole moment increases the gravitational field increases , leading to a decrease in the binary period .",
    "conversely , when the quadrupole moment decreases , the binary period increases @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will use an extraordinarily long o@xmath1c curve for ww cygni to examine whether the above models can explain the cyclic pattern of period variations observed in this object . in ",
    "2 we present our new observations of ww cyg . in  3 an updated ephemeris is computed and residuals in the o@xmath1c plot are discussed and in  4 the three models above are tested .",
    "conclusions are presented in  5 .",
    "ww cygni ( hd 227457 , bd+41 3595 , hip 98814 ) is a relatively bright algol binary with deep ( @xmath7v = 3.5mag ) primary eclipses .",
    "ww cyg s visual magnitude varies from 10.0 to 13.5 with a period of 3.3 days .",
    "this system s brightness and large amplitude have made it a frequent source of study with over a century of observations present in the literature ( see hall & wawrukiewicz 1972 and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite established the spectral type of the primary ( mass - gaining ) star as b8 and speculated that the secondary ( mass - losing ) star was type g. @xcite subsequently assigned the secondary a spectral class of g9 , but due to a paucity of sub - giant calibration stars they were unable to determine its luminosity class .",
    "they also noted that photometrically determined spectral types for algol secondaries are typically later than those determined spectroscopically .",
    "multicolor ccd observations of ww cyg were acquired at the clyde tombaugh campus observatory on the campus of new mexico state university between october 1997 and october 1999 .",
    "the observatory is equipped with a 16 inch f/10 meade lx 200 schmidt - cassegrain telescope and a santa barbara instruments group st8 ccd camera .",
    "the camera uses a kaf1600 ccd with 1520@xmath81020 9@xmath9 m pixels .",
    "readnoise and gain were experimentally determined to be 11 @xmath10 and 2.5 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the camera is equipped with ubvri filters which match the prescription of @xcite . due to the system s poor sensitivity in u ,",
    "no observations were collected in this filter . because the chip plate scale is 0.46 arc seconds / pixel and typical seeing at the observatory is 2.5 - 3  , pixels were binned by two prior to readout .",
    "this procedure decreased the normal readout time from one minute to 15 seconds .",
    "images were stored on a laptop computer whose internal clock was set at the beginning of each night using a utc time signal from a goes weather satellite .",
    "occasional checks of the accuracy of the clock were made during an observing run by initiating exposures synchronously with the wwvb time signal received via shortwave .",
    "exposures were 120 seconds in b , 60 seconds in v , and 30 seconds in r and i. on two occasions ( ut 1998 september 01 and october 11 ) observations were acquired in v only to reduce the sampling time interval so that a more precise determination of the time of primary minimum could be obtained .",
    "otherwise , with a few exceptions , the four filters were cycled in the order bvri .",
    "data were reduced using the aperture photometry packages found in iraf and standard differential photometry techniques .",
    "the b solution was poor and therefore was not used .",
    "magnitudes for ww cyg were obtained relative to two comparison stars from the hst guide star catalog : gsc 3158 - 1468 ( v=12.08 and v@xmath1i=0.66 ) and 3158 - 1228 ( v=11.51 and v@xmath1i=1.74 ) .",
    "the complete multi - color data will be presented in a later paper .",
    "by definition , algol systems involve mass transfer and therefore period changes are expected to occur @xcite . to investigate these changes",
    "a new ephemeris was calculated for ww cyg and its century - long o@xmath1c curve was reexamined .",
    "observations near primary eclipse were obtained at nmsu on ut 1998 august 22 , september 01 , and october 11 .",
    "the light curves for these eclipses are shown in figure 1 , along with the comparison star data .",
    "preliminary times of minima ( tom ) were then determined from a visual inspection of these observations .",
    "these times were then refined using the algorithm of @xcite and a computer code kindly provided by dr .",
    "r. nelson ( 2000 , private communication ) ( see also mallama 1982 ) .",
    "the new tom are listed in table 1 along with an earlier tom determined by @xcite .",
    "a weighted linear least squares fit to these tom gives the following ephemeris @xmath12    @xcite conducted a thorough literature search and produced an o@xmath1c plot of ww cyg through 1972 using the ephemeris of @xcite    @xmath13    in table 2 we list post 1972 o@xmath1c data with respect to graff s ephemeris .",
    "this allows us to extend the o@xmath1c plot by almost 30 years .",
    "we plot the entire 107 year o@xmath1c data in figure 2 together with the best fit parabola ,    @xmath14    with all points weighted equally .",
    "the long term trend in figure 2 indicates an increasing period . assuming this trend is the result of mass transfer we attempted an estimate of the mass transfer rate @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite derived a relationship for the change in the orbital period assuming total orbital angular momentum is conserved while mass is transferred from one star to another . reproducing equation 5 of @xcite :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the change in the period @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the mass of the secondary , @xmath20 is the mass of the primary , and @xmath21 is the change in mass of @xmath19 .",
    "an estimate for the mass transfer rate in ww cyg can now be made . between the ephemeris of @xcite and equation 1 the period",
    "increased by 0.0002 days . using the solution for ww cyg presented by @xcite the mass of the secondary",
    "can be set to 2@xmath22 and the mass ratio to @xmath23 . over an elapsed time of 100 years equation 4",
    "gives as a mass transfer estimate    @xmath24    this simplistic treatment of mass transfer is probably an underestimate of the actual mass transfer rate . a more realistic model for non - conservative mass transfer is the wind - driven mass - transfer model derived by @xcite .",
    "the mass transfer rate determined for the algol u cep in @xcite is an order of magnitude larger than the estimate above .",
    "a careful examination of the o@xmath1c curve in figure 2 shows that ww cyg possesses an alternating sequence of period increases and decreases superimposed upon a parabola .",
    "this behavior is more easily seen in figure 3 where the residuals from the parabolic fit are shown .",
    "below we examine three of the most widely discussed hypotheses used to explain this type of cyclic behavior .    _",
    "a ) mass exchange or mass loss due to stellar winds _ : the most frequently mentioned explanation for period changes in close binary systems is the transfer of mass from one star to another",
    ". however , mass transfer from a less massive to a more massive component results in a steadily increasing period not an alternating sequence of period increases and decreases .",
    "mass transfer also appears to be an unsuitable explanation for the cyclic o@xmath1c pattern seen in close binaries for another reason .",
    "the rs cvn systems , in which cyclic o@xmath1c patterns are present , are in general detached systems @xcite , so mass transfer can not be invoked . mass loss due to stellar winds also appears to be ruled out . @xcite have shown that for rs cvn stars the mass loss rates required to produce a quasi - periodic signal in the o@xmath1c diagram are orders of magnitude larger than allowed by observations .",
    "they note that such losses would conflict with the detection of soft x - rays from @xmath25 aur , ux ari , hr 1099 , and rs cvn .",
    "if we assume a single process produces the cyclic o@xmath1c curves , neither of these processes appear to be viable .",
    "_ b ) the presence of a third body _ : the possibility that the cyclic o@xmath1c changes in algols and other short period binaries are due to the presence of a third star has been discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and recently by @xcite . in this model",
    "the binary revolves around the center of mass of the system thereby creating a regular change in the observed period due to a light travel time effect ( ltte ) .",
    "borkovits and heged@xmath26s tested this suggestion by incorporating the gravitational effects of a third body into fits of the residual o@xmath1c curves of 18 close binaries .",
    "this model was able to produce qualitative agreement between the observed and computed o@xmath1c curves for 4 systems ( 1 algol , 3 w uma ) by solving for the orbital elements of the assumed third body . in general , the mass of the third star was less than 0.5 @xmath27 ( with one exception ) and therefore could have escaped detection .",
    "marginal evidence for a third body was presented for four other systems ( all algols ) .",
    "marginal solutions required more than one unseen companion and the mass for these companions , more than 2 @xmath27 depending on eccentricity , begins to present non - detection problems .",
    "for eight other systems ltte solutions of dubious reliability were obtained by borkovits and heged@xmath26s for the sake of completeness .",
    "ltte solutions could not be found for only two of the 18 binaries they studied .",
    "motivated by this study we used the o@xmath1c data for ww cyg shown in figure 2 to further test this hypothesis .",
    "@xcite has shown that a third object orbiting a close binary creates a periodic pattern in an o@xmath1c curve and that by describing this signal as a fourier series , the orbital parameters of the third body can be determined . following the method adopted by @xcite",
    ", we first subtracted the best - fit parabola shown in figure 2 from the ww cyg data .",
    "the power spectra of these residuals were then computed and yielded a waveform having the parameters    @xmath28,\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the waveform of the residuals in days , @xmath30 is the epoch , 1.61 @xmath31 is the inverse period in epochs of graff s ephemeris , and the phase is @xmath32 radians .",
    "this power spectrum is shown in figure 4 as a solid line . when equation 4 is plotted on the actual data ( figure 5a )",
    ", it did not provide a satisfactory fit .",
    "consider the residuals in two groups ; one from 1890 to 1940 and the other from 1940 to 1998 . the earlier group appears to have a narrow inverted v shape , and a shorter period compared to the later group .",
    "additionally , the observations of 1890 - 1900 and 1960 - 1972 deviate from the predicted form .",
    "if the third body possesses an orbit with a nonzero eccentricity , the waveform contains both fundamental and first harmonic terms . adopting equation 6 as the fundamental",
    ", we searched for its first harmonic at twice the frequency of the fundamental .",
    "the fundamental was subtracted from the data and the power spectrum was recomputed , but the subsequent power spectrum was found to be noise dominated ( see lower dashed curve in figure 4 ) .",
    "we then used an iterative non - linear least squares fitting routine , based on the marquardt algorithm @xcite to determine the parameters of the first harmonic .",
    "this program seeks to identify individual coefficients by varying designated input values so that the sum of the squares of the residuals are minimized . as an initial guess ,",
    "an amplitude of 10 percent of the fundamental was employed since this value was similar to that found by @xcite for other close binaries .",
    "the parameters of the fundamental ( amplitude , frequency and phase ) were fixed as was the frequency of the first harmonic . according to @xcite , the eccentricity of the third companion",
    "is given as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the eccentricity of the orbit and the @xmath35 s and @xmath36 s are the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms respectively of the fourier components of the o@xmath1c residuals .",
    "our assumed amplitude yields an eccentricity of @xmath37 0.1 . with the amplitude and phase of the first harmonic as the only free parameters , the fitting routine consistently produced unrealistic eccentricities that were greater than one .",
    "fixing only the frequencies and leaving the amplitudes and phases of the two waveforms as free parameters produced unrealistic fits to the data . constraining the amplitude of the first harmonic at 0.002 days and leaving the phase of the first harmonic as the only free parameter resulted in an unacceptably high reduced @xmath38 of greater than 130 .",
    "based on these experiments , we conclude that the third body hypothesis fails to explain the observed o@xmath1c curve for ww cyg .",
    "this agrees with the naive expectation from figure 5a as the residuals do not appear to be strictly periodic .",
    "_ c ) magnetic cycles _ : in an important study comparing rs cvn to algol binaries , @xcite found a striking correlation between the development of surface convection in the low mass secondary and the presence of an alternating orbital period .",
    "hall s plot , reproduced here as figure 6 , illustrates that when the secondary has a spectral type earlier than about f5 the orbital period never displays an alternating pattern of period increases and decreases . for systems where the secondary has a spectral type later that an f5 , a significant number of binaries possess alternating periods .",
    "hall interpreted this finding as evidence that the onset of convection plays an important role in producing cyclic period changes . @xcite and @xcite attempted to explain the o@xmath1c patterns by assuming deformations of the star away from hydrostatic equilibrium due to tidal or magnetic pressure effects , respectively .",
    "however , @xcite showed that tidal or magnetic pressure induced distortions in the active star away from hydrostatic equilibrium were ruled out based on energetic considerations .",
    "such distortions could not be the method by which the quadrupole moment is deformed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite subsequently proposed that a cyclic o@xmath1c pattern could be produced if the active star s internal angular momentum distribution changes as the star goes through a magnetic activity cycle similar to that of the sun .",
    "@xcite avoids the energy quandary mentioned above by maintaining fluid hydrostatic equilibrium throughout the cycle .",
    "this was suggested as a common mechanism to explain the same alternating period changes seen in w umas , rs cvns , and cvs .",
    "this suggestion is consistent with the observational evidence for rs cvn - like magnetic activity signatures in algols ( richards 1990 ; richards & albright 1993 ) .    in the models of @xcite and @xcite , the rotational oblateness of the late type star produces a change in the gravitational quadrupole moment , and hence the orbit . in both models , the gravitational field of the primary",
    "is treated as originating from a point mass .",
    "the field of the secondary is computed as arising from a point source located at the star s barycenter and a quadrupole moment term caused by tidal and rotational deformations .",
    "changes in the star s effective angular velocity are then directly related to changes in the quadrupole moment and to changes in the orbital period ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the angular velocity changes as a result of a torque supplied by the magnetic field in the outer convective region of the late - type star .",
    "the presence of the required dynamo in the convective secondary stars is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "their analysis showed that the modulation period of 46 close binaries supported the view that a dynamo operated in the outer atmospheres of the secondary stars .",
    "the principal advantages of this model are that it presents a physically plausible explanation whose time scale is in rough agreement with that seen in the o@xmath1c plots and that it removes the need for strict periodicity .",
    "figure 6 demonstrates that there is no correlation of orbital period changes with mass ratio .",
    "however , if the gravitational quadrupole moment term plays a dominant role in the creation of cyclic period changes , a correlation may also exist between the occurrence of an alternating period change and a binary s orbital separation .",
    "cyclic o@xmath1c variations should be more pronounced in systems where the secondary star is most deformed , i.e. when the orbital separations are small .",
    "conversely , when the separations are large , the secondary star should not be as deformed and cyclic variations should not be as pronounced . to test this idea we constructed figure 7 which shows whether these predictions are supported by the available data .",
    "as hall did in figure 6 we selected algols with convective secondaries from @xcite .",
    "we then searched the literature for published o@xmath1c curves for these systems and present the data in table 3 .",
    "the columns in this table refer to the systems we selected , the secondary spectral type , the binary period in days , nature of the period change , and the reference(s ) for the o@xmath1c data . in a few cases the secondary spectral type in table 3 differs from that in @xcite .",
    "the reference for the updated secondary spectral type is given as a footnote for these systems .",
    "the form of the period change noted in table 3 follows the convention used in figure 6 with the same symbols being employed in figure 7 for consistency .",
    "it is clear from figure 7 that alternating period variations are prominent in binaries with a period under 6 days and that alternating period variations are less common in systems with larger orbital separations .",
    "we consider this result to be suggestive , however more data is needed to confirm it .",
    "this is particularly true for those systems not marked by an `` x '' which possess short periods .",
    "we note that the low number of algols with periods greater than 10 days is also insufficient to make a firm statement about the nature of the o@xmath1c plots in this region of the diagram .",
    "observational selection effects probably play a role here because eclipse timings for these systems are more difficult to obtain .",
    "additionally , @xcite show that almost 80 percent of their 101 algols have periods under 6.5 days .",
    "additional predictions of the applegate model are that the brightness of the active star should vary with the same period as seen in the o@xmath1c plot and that this change should be about 0.1 magnitude . based on arguments about the manner in which kinetic and magnetic energy are exchanged",
    ", @xcite suggested that 0.1 magnitude is probably an upper limit . because the brightness change is caused by variations in the star s differential rotation and not to changes in its radius , the star should also be bluer when at maximum brightness .",
    "these predictions were tested by hall ( 1991 ) using the rs cvn system cg cyg .",
    "the active star in this system has a spectral type of g9.5v .",
    "hall found that this system s o@xmath1c curve possessed a cyclic pattern with a period of about 52 years ( see figure 1 in hall 1991 ) .",
    "using plots of this object s mean brightness and color while outside eclipse , he found that these quantities varied with the same period as the o@xmath1c curve .",
    "he also found that this system was bluest when it was brightest . although hall argued that these results confirmed the applegate model , the magnitude and color data he presented covered only about half of the 52 year cycle .",
    "this conclusion must therefore be considered as tentative .",
    "nevertheless , if hall s result is accepted , it suggests that , like the sun , the surface layer of the active star is spinning faster than its lower layers .",
    "we can perform a similar , but cruder , analysis for ww cyg .",
    "when @xcite observed this star on jd = 2440407.7 ( epoch 7061 ) it had a primary minimum of v=13.26 and dereddened colors appropriate to a g2iii or k0v .",
    "when we observed ww cyg on jd= 2451057.8 ( epoch 10,268 ) it had v=13.46 and dereddened v@xmath1r appropriate to a k2v .",
    "examining figure 5a , we found that the times when the secondary was at its brightest(bluest ) and faintest(reddest ) were when the o@xmath1c wave was at its maximum and minimum values , respectively .",
    "according to applegate s ( 1992 ) model this implies that the surface layer of the secondary of ww cyg is rotating more slowly than its subsurface layer .",
    "this result differs with that found by hall for the g9.5v star in cg cyg , which has a similar spectral type .",
    "this difference in rotational structure might appear to be troubling but the secondary in ww cyg is most likely a subgiant so this example does not provide a direct comparison .",
    "nevertheless , it does illustrate how long term period changes due to magnetic activity may provide a probe of the interior structures of late - type stars in close binary systems .",
    "ww cyg , like several other close binaries , displays an alternating pattern in its times for primary eclipse .",
    "we have explored three possible causes for this cyclic behavior : mass exchange and mass loss due to stellar winds , the presence of a third body , and magnetic cycles .",
    "the first two possibilities appear to be ruled out .",
    "however , the current evidence is consistent with the idea that magnetic cycles within a lower mass secondary of spectral type later than f5 , play a role .",
    "convection and rotation leading to magnetic dynamo activity have been theoretically shown to produce cyclic changes in the gravitational field of the system .",
    "these changes are of sufficient strength to produce orbital period changes of the observed size in close binaries .",
    "additionally , the time frame for these period changes is of the same order of magnitude as the magnetic cycles of late type stars @xcite .",
    "although we feel that the evidence at this point is not conclusive , variations in the gravitational quadrupole moment caused by magnetic activity appears to provide the best explanation for the cyclic behavior of the o@xmath1c curves observed in ww cyg and other close binary systems .",
    "more data are needed to construct a larger sample of o@xmath1c curves for close binaries .",
    "we urge that both magnitude and color information be collected for a variety of close binaries to show how the internal rotation of the late - type star changes with time . because several of these systems are relatively bright",
    ", this type of observational program is well suited to facilities equipped with telescopes of modest aperture .",
    "we are indebted to the many observers , amateur and professional , who amassed the wealth of data on the eclipsing binaries listed in table 3 .",

    "<S> years to decade - long cyclic orbital period changes have been observed in several classes of close binary systems including algols , w ursae majoris and rs canum venaticorum systems , and the cataclysmic variables . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of these changes is unknown , but mass loss , apsidal motion , magnetic activity , and the presence of a third body have all been proposed . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use new ccd observations and the century - long historical record of the times of primary eclipse for ww cygni to explore the cause of these period changes . </S>",
    "<S> ww cygni is an algol binary whose orbital period undergoes a 56 year cyclic variation with an amplitude of @xmath0 days . </S>",
    "<S> we consider and reject the hypotheses of mass transfer , mass loss , apsidal motion and the gravitational influence of an unseen companion as the cause for these changes . </S>",
    "<S> a model proposed by applegate , which invokes changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the convective and rotating secondary star , is the most likely explanation of this star s orbital period changes . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is based on an examination of ww cygni s residual o@xmath1c curve and an analysis of the period changes seen in 66 other algols . </S>",
    "<S> variations in the gravitational quadrupole moment are also considered to be the most likely explanation for the cyclic period changes observed in several different types of binary systems . </S>"
