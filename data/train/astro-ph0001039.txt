    "the study of dense matter in laboratories reveals many new and interesting results . there is a growing interplay between the physics of dense matter and the physics of compact objects @xcite .",
    "the composition and structure of a neutron star primarily depends on the nature of strong interaction .",
    "the equation of state of neutron star matter encompasses a wide range of densities , from the density of iron nucleus at the star s surface to several times the normal nuclear matter density encountered in the core",
    ". since the chemical potentials of nucleons and leptons increase rapidly with density in the stars interior , several novel phases with large strangeness fraction may appear . among these possibilities ,",
    "hyperon formation is quite a robust mechanism .",
    "this is possible when the neutron chemical potential becomes sufficiently large so that the neutrons at their fermi surfaces can decay into hyperons via weak strangeness non - conserving interactions .",
    "the threshold densities for hyperon formation strongly depend on the nuclear equation of state @xcite .    in recent years",
    "considerable interest has grown in the study of the properties of kaons , @xmath4 , and antikaons , @xmath5 , in dense nuclear matter and in neutron star matter . within a chiral @xmath6 lagrangian , it was demonstrated by kaplan and nelson @xcite that a negatively charged antikaon @xmath0 may undergo bose - einstein condensation in dense baryonic matter formed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "it was further predicted in the chiral perturbation theory that a @xmath0 condensed phase may form in the core of neutron stars @xcite in consonance with kaon - nucleon scattering data @xcite and @xmath0 atomic data @xcite . in these chiral lagrangians ,",
    "the ( anti)kaons are directly coupled to nucleons . the strongly attractive @xmath0-nucleon interaction increases with density lowering the effective mass @xmath7 of the antikaons",
    ". consequently , the in - medium energy of @xmath0 meson , @xmath8 , decreases and @xmath9-wave @xmath0 condensation sets in when @xmath8 equals to the @xmath0 chemical potential @xmath10 which , in turn , is equal to the electron chemical potential @xmath11 for a cold catalyzed ( neutrino - free ) neutron star matter . the typical critical density for @xmath0 condensation in nucleons - only star matter is about @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the exact value , however , depends on the model used , i.e. on the nucleonic equation of state and on the parameters employed , especially on the depth of the attractive @xmath0 optical potential .",
    "the net effect of @xmath0 condensation in neutron star matter is that @xmath0 replaces electrons in maintaining charge neutrality and the energy of the condensate is lowered because of strongly attractive interactions between nucleons and @xmath0 mesons . due to the softening of the equation of state the masses of the stars",
    "are reduced in presence of @xmath0 condensate @xcite .",
    "it was also found that in presence of hyperons , @xmath0 condensation was delayed to higher density , and may not even exist in maximum mass stars .",
    "protoneutron ( newly born and neutrino rich ) stars with @xmath0 condensate was shown to have maximum masses larger than those of cold catalyzed ( old and neutrino free ) stars - a reversal from ordinary nucleons - only star .",
    "these stars may undergo supernovae explosion and then could collapse to small mass black holes during deleptonization @xcite .",
    "the situation for kaons is however quite different .",
    "theoretical investigations based on nambu@xmath14jona - lasinio model @xcite , chiral perturbation theory @xcite , and one - boson - exchange model @xcite yield a repulsive optical potential for @xmath15 in nuclear medium .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 condensation is expected to be forbidden in neutron stars .    in the traditional meson - exchange picture",
    "@xcite , ( anti)kaons and baryons interact via the exchange of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 mesons .",
    "in addition to the decrease of @xmath7 with density here , the energy @xmath8 is lowered since @xmath0 meson experiences attractive vector @xmath17-meson potential due to g - parity of antikaons .",
    "in contrast , the isovector @xmath18-meson field is repulsive for @xmath0 and inhibits @xmath0 condensation delaying it to higher densities . in neutron stars at densities above normal nuclear matter values ,",
    "most of the protons convert into neutrons by inverse @xmath19-decay since it is energetically favorable to posses a small number of electrons .",
    "the ratio of electrons to nucleons which is again equal to the proton fraction due to charge neutrality is typically @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , neutron star matter is highly asymmetric and quite distinct from ordinary symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath18-meson field should have a strong repulsive effect on @xmath0 meson . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath18-meson field induces an attractive field for @xmath1 meson which is an isodoublet partner of @xmath0 meson .",
    "this should lower the effective energy of @xmath1 meson , @xmath21 , compared to that of @xmath0 meson thereby making @xmath1 meson condensation more favorable in neutron star matter .",
    "the critical density for @xmath9-wave neutral @xmath1 meson condensation is governed by the condition @xmath22 , and should depend sensitively on the equation of state ( eos ) . using variational chain summation method with two - nucleon and three - nucleon interactions , akmal et al .",
    "@xcite recently predicted a neutral pion condensation phase transition in neutron star matter at a density of @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "so far no calculation of neutral @xmath1 condensation and its impact on the gross properties of neutron stars has been performed . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of antikaon condensation with more emphasize on @xmath1 condensate on the constitution and structure of neutron star matter in the standard meson exchange model . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the usual relativistic mean field lagrangian @xcite for baryons interacting via meson exchanges and includes also the self - interaction of the mesons .",
    "the antikaons are treated in the same footing as the baryons which interact by the exchange of the same mesons . for the @xmath0 meson , the lagrangian density of ref .",
    "@xcite is used , and it is extended to include the @xmath1 meson .",
    "we shall demonstrate within this model that , apart from the @xmath0 meson ( as already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the @xmath1 condensate may also exist inside a neutron star and has a significant influence on the star properties",
    ". we shall also show that the threshold densities for the antikaon condensates are quite sensitive to the poorly known high density regime of the equation of state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section ii we describe the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model of strong interactions .",
    "the relevant equations for neutron star matter with antikaon condensate are summarized in this model . in section",
    "iii the parameters of the model are discussed and effects of antikaon condensates in neutron star matter are presented .",
    "section iv is devoted to summary and conclusions .",
    "the starting point in the present approach is a relativistic field theoretical model of baryons and ( anti)kaons interacting by the exchange of scalar @xmath16 , isoscalar vector @xmath17 , and vector isovector @xmath18 mesons .",
    "the total hadronic lagrangian can be written as the sum of the baryonic , kaonic and leptonic parts , i.e. @xmath25 . considering all the charge states of the baryon octet @xmath26 , the baryonic lagrangian is given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 denotes the dirac spinor for baryon b with vacuum mass @xmath29 and isospin operator @xmath30 .",
    "the scalar self - interaction term @xmath31 is included @xcite to achieve a realistic compression modulus at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the lagrangian density for ( anti)kaons in the minimal coupling scheme is given by @xcite @xmath32 with a covariant derivative @xmath33 .",
    "the isospin doublet for the kaons is denoted by @xmath34 and that for the antikaons is @xmath35 .",
    "the effective mass of ( anti)kaons in this minimal coupling scheme is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is bare kaon mass .",
    "in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) adopted here , the meson fields are replaced by their mean values and the baryon currents by those generated in the presence of the mean meson fields . for a uniform and static matter within mfa ,",
    "only the time - like components of the vector fields , and the isospin 3-component of @xmath18-meson field have non - vanishing values .",
    "the mean meson fields are denoted by @xmath16 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "for @xmath9-wave ( @xmath40 ) condensation of antikaons @xmath5 , the dispersion relation representing the in - medium energies of @xmath35 is given by @xmath41 where the isospin projection @xmath42 for the mesons @xmath0 ( @xmath14 sign ) and @xmath1 ( + sign ) are explicitly written in the expression .",
    "since the @xmath16 and @xmath17 fields generally increase with density and both being attractive for antikaons , the effective energies of @xmath5 are lowered in nuclear medium . moreover , in nucleons - only matter @xmath43 ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the proton and neutron densities ) is negative , thus the @xmath18-meson field inhibits @xmath0 condensation whereas it favors @xmath1 condensation .",
    "employing g - parity which simply transforms the sign of vector potential , the energies of kaons @xmath34 are expressed as @xmath46 the @xmath17-meson field being repulsive for the kaons and dominates over the attractive @xmath16-meson field at high densities is suggestive of the fact that kaon condensation should be highly restricted .",
    "the meson field equations in presence of baryons and antikaon condensates can be derived from eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) as @xmath47 here the scalar and number density of baryon @xmath48 are respectively @xmath49 with effective baryonic mass @xmath50 , fermi momentum @xmath51 , spin @xmath52 , and isospin projection @xmath53 .",
    "note that for @xmath9-wave @xmath54 condensation , the scalar and vector densities of antikaons are same , and in the mfa is given by @xcite @xmath55 the total energy density @xmath56 has contributions from baryons , leptons , and antikaons .",
    "the baryonic plus leptonic energy density is @xmath57 the last term corresponds to the energy of leptons as required in a neutron star matter .",
    "the energy density for antikaons is @xmath58 since antikaons form @xmath9-wave bose condensates , they do not directly contribute to the pressure so that the pressure is due to baryons and leptons only @xmath59 the pressure due to antikaons is contained entirely in the meson fields via their field equations ( 7)-(9 ) .    at the interior of neutron stars ,",
    "nucleons and electrons undergo usual @xmath19-decay processes @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "when the electron chemical potential becomes equal to the muon mass , electrons are converted to muons by @xmath62 . in the present study of cold neutron star",
    "we may assume that the neutrinos have left the system freely .",
    "therefore the chemical potentials of nucleons and leptons are governed by the equilibrium conditions @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath11 , and @xmath66 are the chemical potentials of neutrons , protons , electrons , and muons with @xmath67 . with the onset of @xmath5 condensation , the strangeness changing processes that may occur are @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the isospin doublets for nucleons and antikaons , respectively .",
    "the requirement of chemical equilibrium yields @xmath72 where @xmath10 and @xmath73 are respectively the chemical potentials of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the above conditions dictate the onset of antikaon condensations .",
    "when the effective energy of @xmath0 meson , @xmath8 , equals to its chemical potential , @xmath10 , which in turn is equal to the electrochemical potential @xmath11 , a @xmath0 condensate is formed . while @xmath1 condensation follows when its in - medium energy satisfies the condition @xmath74 .",
    "when other baryons in the form of hyperons are present in the neutron star matter , the standard @xmath19-decay processes for nucleons generalize to the form @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are baryons and @xmath79 is a lepton .",
    "all the equilibrium conditions involving the baryon octet may then be summarized by a single generic equation @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are , respectively , the chemical potential and electric charge of baryon species @xmath48 .",
    "the above relations indicate that , in chemical equilibrium , two independent chemical potentials , @xmath64 and @xmath11 , exist which correspond to baryon number and electric charge conservation . for neutron star matter",
    "we need to include also the charge neutrality condition , which in presence of antikaon condensate is expressed as @xmath83    in the present calculation we consider antikaon condensation as a second order phase transition . in principle in neutron star matter with two conserved charges , baryon and electric charge ,",
    "the condensation can also be treated as a first order phase transition @xcite . in this situation",
    ", the star would have at low density a normal phase of baryons and leptons followed by a mixed phase of @xmath0 condensate and baryons , and possibly a pure @xmath0 condensed phase at a higher density .",
    "however in the present situation this would be more complicated as @xmath0 and @xmath1 have to be treated as two separate phases , and especially when the threshold density of one condensate may be reached in the mixed phase of nucleons and the other condensate .",
    "treatment of such a triple phase would be numerically very involved and is postponed to a future publication .",
    "in the effective field theoretic approach adopted here , three distinct sets of coupling constants for nucleons , kaons , and hyperons associated with the exchange of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 mesons are required .",
    "the nucleon - meson coupling constants generated by reproducing the nuclear matter saturation properties are taken from glendenning and moszkowski of ref .",
    "this set is referred to as gm1 and listed in table i.    let us now determine the kaon - meson coupling constants . according to the quark and isospin counting rule ,",
    "the vector coupling constants are given by @xmath84 the scalar coupling constant is obtained from the real part of the @xmath0 optical potential at normal nuclear matter density @xmath85 the negative sign in the vector meson potential is due to g - parity .",
    "the critical density of @xmath5 condensation should therefore strongly depend on the @xmath0 optical potential .",
    "recent fits @xcite to the @xmath0 atomic data indicate a strong attractive potential in dense matter . more recently , in high energy heavy ion collisions enhanced subthreshold @xmath0 production with a steep spectral slope",
    "was found @xcite . in a simplified model",
    "this may be interpreted as a strong @xmath0 attraction in nuclear matter . on the other hand",
    ", available @xmath86 scattering length suggests a repulsive interaction .",
    "the reason for this apparent ambiguity is the presence of @xmath87-resonance which is considered to be an unstable @xmath88 bound state just below the @xmath89 threshold that makes the interpretation of the data more complicated .",
    "recent analysis @xcite of @xmath0 atomic data using a hybrid model which combines the relativistic mean field approach in the nuclear interior and a phenomenological density dependent potential at low density showed that the real part of @xmath0 optical potential could be as large as @xmath90 mev at normal nuclear matter density while being slightly repulsive at low density in accordance with the low density theorem .",
    "coupled channel formalism which automatically generates the @xmath87-resonance and successfully describes the low energy @xmath89 scattering data yields an attractive potential for the @xmath0 meson of @xmath91 mev @xcite . in a chirally motivated coupled channel approach ,",
    "the @xmath5 optical potential depth was found to be @xmath92 mev @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a spread in the predicted values lies in the diversity of treating the @xmath87-resonance .",
    "we have therefore determined the @xmath93 coupling constant @xmath94 for a set of values of @xmath95 starting from @xmath96 mev to @xmath97 mev .",
    "this is listed in table ii for the set gm1 .",
    "since the @xmath17-meson potential for @xmath5 in this model is @xmath98 mev , a rather large sigma - kaon coupling constant of @xmath99 is required to reproduce a depth of @xmath97 mev .",
    "note that only for this large depth the value of the scalar coupling is similar to the prediction in the simple quark model i.e. , @xmath100 .    as an alternative approach",
    "the kaon - meson coupling constants may be determined from the @xmath9-wave kaon - nucleon ( @xmath101 ) scattering length . at the tree level ,",
    "the isospin averaged @xmath101 scattering length is given by @xcite @xmath102 from the low density theorem , the kaon optical potential depth is given by @xmath103 using the experimental values @xcite of @xmath104 fm and @xmath105 fm , the scattering length is @xmath106 fm .",
    "the @xmath4 optical potential depth is then @xmath107 mev at @xmath108 @xmath24 and is repulsive . in the gm1 parameter",
    "set , for @xmath5 depths of @xmath109 mev , we obtain @xmath101 average scattering lengths and @xmath4 optical potential depths of @xmath110 fm and @xmath111 mev . with @xmath112 mev ,",
    "the attractive potential obtained for kaon optical potential depth ( apart from rather small vector potential of ( anti)kaon @xmath113 ) is due to the neglect of @xmath87-resonance which is beyond the scope of this paper .    in the present study",
    "we shall be mostly concerned with antikaon condensation in nucleons - only matter . in general",
    ", the presence of hyperons delays the onset of @xmath5 condensation to much higher densities @xcite .",
    "however , for orientation we shall only provide briefly the effects of hyperons on antikaon condensation in neutron star matter .",
    "the vector coupling constants for the hyperons are obtained from @xmath114 symmetry @xmath115 the @xmath16-meson couplings to the hyperons ( @xmath116 ) can be obtained from the well - depth of @xmath116 in saturated nuclear matter @xmath117 analysis of energy levels in @xmath118-hypernuclei suggests @xcite a well - depth of @xmath118 in nuclear matter of @xmath119 mev . for the @xmath120 potential the situation is unclear , since there is no evidence for bound @xmath120-hypernuclei .",
    "the prediction range from completely bound @xmath120 s @xcite with @xmath121 mev to unbound @xcite with @xmath122 mev",
    ". a few events in emulsion experiments with @xmath0 beams have been attributed @xcite to the formation of @xmath123-hypernuclei from which the depth of @xmath124 in nuclear matter has been extracted to be @xmath125 mev .",
    "recently , a few @xmath124-hypernuclei events have been identified in ( @xmath126 ) reaction from which a tighter constraint on @xmath124 well - depth of @xmath127 mev has been imposed @xcite . the coupling constants @xmath128 for hyperons have been obtained using these depths .",
    "we now present results for neutron star matter containing nucleons , leptons , and @xmath5 condensates for the parameter set gm1 of tables i and ii . in fig .",
    "1 , the nucleon scalar and vector potentials , and the electron chemical potential are displayed as a function of baryon density normalized to the equilibrium value of @xmath13 for @xmath0 optical potential depth of @xmath129 mev .",
    "the solid lines refer to results for nucleons - only matter and the dashed ones correspond to calculation with @xmath5 condensate . with @xmath5 condensation",
    "we find that the scalar potential is enhanced while vector @xmath17- and @xmath18-meson potentials are decreased .",
    "the kinks in the dashed lines correspond to the onset of @xmath1 condensation when the meson potentials deviate further from nucleons - only results .",
    "the variation in the meson fields may be attributed to the occurrence of the source terms due to @xmath5 condensation in the field equations of motion ( eqs .",
    "( 7)-(9 ) ) .",
    "the populations of neutron star matter with and without @xmath5 condensation are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the top panel , the particle abundances of nucleons -",
    "only matter are shown . here",
    "all the particle fractions increase with baryon density .",
    "the behavior of the proton ( and lepton ) fractions are determined by nuclear symmetry energy which in turn is controlled by the @xmath18-meson field in the rmf models . in the central panel we exhibit the particle abundances of the star matter with @xmath0 condensation at @xmath129 mev , which in fact is the first particle to condense among the two antikaons @xmath71 .",
    "once @xmath0 condensate sets in at @xmath130 , it rapidly increases with density replacing the leptons in maintaining charge neutrality . the proton density which then becomes equal to @xmath0 density eventually turns out to be larger than the neutron density ; the neutron density nearly freezes to a constant value .",
    "this can be understood from the threshold condition of @xmath0 condensation @xmath131 ( see eq .",
    "( 17 ) ) . substituting explicitly these values",
    ", we obtain @xmath132 since at high densities , the @xmath17-meson potential dominates the @xmath16-meson potential and @xmath43 is negative , the term within the bracket is positive .",
    "it is therefore evident that @xmath133 .",
    "this has been also observed in ref .",
    "hence the net effect of @xmath0 condensation is to lower the electron chemical potential @xmath11 and the nuclear symmetry energy ( see also fig .",
    "1 ) . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 , we show the particle fractions with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensates .",
    "interestingly , with the onset of @xmath1 condensate at @xmath134 , the neutron and proton abundances become identical resulting in an isospin saturated symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this can be easily understood by substituting the threshold condition for @xmath1 condensation , i.e. @xmath22 , from eq .",
    "( 5 ) into eq . ( 27 ) . from these relations",
    "it is clear that @xmath1 condensate formation enforces the condition @xmath135 .",
    "alternatively , one may interpret from the central panel of fig .",
    "2 that once the neutron and proton densities ( fermi momenta ) become identical , the isodoublet partner of @xmath0 meson , i.e. @xmath1 should be populated .",
    "the electrochemical potential @xmath136 then merges with the magnitude of the @xmath18-meson potential @xmath137 with @xmath138 , as is evident from fig .",
    "1 . at densities above @xmath139 , the antikaon densities are equal which is a general feature of isospin driving force towards symmetry .",
    "the @xmath18-meson field and thereby @xmath11 vanishes . as a consequence",
    "we are left with a system composed of exactly equal amount of @xmath140 , i.e. a perfectly symmetric matter of nucleons and antikaons . for this matter ,",
    "the strangeness fraction @xmath141 is as large as unity .    in fig .",
    "3 , the effective masses of the ( anti)kaons , @xmath7 , are shown as a function of normalized density for various values of @xmath0 optical potential depths from @xmath96 mev to @xmath97 mev in steps of 20 mev . note",
    "that @xmath5 is only a test particle in the field of nucleons and appear physically only after condensation .",
    "the decrease of @xmath7 is found to be quite sensitive to the @xmath0 depth which determines the onset of condensation . at a given @xmath95 ,",
    "the ( anti)kaon mass decreases more strongly with successive condensation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "this is a manifestation of increase in the @xmath16-meson field with condensation as can be seen in fig .",
    "figure 4 shows the @xmath9-wave condensation energies for @xmath0 meson , @xmath8 ( solid lines ) , and for @xmath1 meson , @xmath21 ( dashed lines ) , as a function of density of various antikaon optical potential depths in the gm1 set .",
    "the effective energies follow a similar qualitative trend as @xmath7 .",
    "however , for depths up to @xmath142 mev , the effective kaon masses do not vary significantly ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . therefore ,",
    "considering eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the large drop in @xmath143 with density is dominated by @xmath17-meson that influences @xmath5 condensation . for higher values of @xmath144 , the large decrease in @xmath7s due to large couplings @xmath94",
    "are primarily responsible for condensation . for any value of @xmath144 , the isovector potential of nucleons shifts the energy of @xmath1 meson below that of the @xmath0 meson by @xmath145 mev . at a given @xmath144 , condensation of @xmath0 meson",
    "occurs when @xmath8 intersects the electron chemical potential @xmath11 in absence of a condensate ( shown by dotted line ) . for all values of @xmath5 depth",
    "we find that @xmath0 meson is formed before the threshold density for @xmath1 condensate , i.e. @xmath146 , is reached .",
    "the critical densities for @xmath5 condensates are collected in table iii for different values of @xmath95 . a careful investigation of fig .",
    "4 reveals that beyond the densities for @xmath0 condensates ( and before @xmath1 threshold densities ) , the rate of decrease of the energies @xmath143 are attenuated . this can be traced back to the density - dependent behavior of the meson fields in fig .",
    "1 . above @xmath0 formation density",
    "the decrease in @xmath17-meson field dominates over the increase in the @xmath16-meson field .",
    "this leads to smaller rate of decrease of @xmath8 and @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the decrease in the @xmath18-meson field due to @xmath0 condensation causes even a smaller decrease of @xmath1 energy with density .",
    "thus the @xmath0 meson condensate with the help of the vector mesons conspires to delay the appearance of its isospin partner @xmath1 meson to a higher density . at densities above @xmath1 condensate ,",
    "the @xmath0 energy again starts to decrease due to dramatic fall of @xmath18-meson potential .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) , pressure @xmath147 versus the energy density @xmath148 is displayed in fig .",
    "5 for the gm1 parameter set .",
    "the solid line represents calculation for nucleons - only star matter while the dashed lines refer to those with @xmath5 formation for different values of @xmath95 .",
    "the strong attraction imparted by antikaon condensation makes the eos softer .",
    "the kinks at higher densities in the dashed lines correspond to the appearance of @xmath1 condensation which further soften the eos .",
    "also the softness is quite sensitive to the choice of the @xmath5 optical potential depth .",
    "a large @xmath95 corresponds to larger attraction and thereby an enhanced softening of the eos .",
    "we have used the results of baym , pethick and sutherland @xcite to describe the crust consisting of leptons and nuclei at the low - density ( @xmath149 @xmath24 ) eos . for the mid - density regime ( @xmath150 @xmath24 )",
    "the results of negele and vautherin @xcite are employed . above this density ,",
    "the eos for the relativistic models have been adopted .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that though we have treated @xmath5 condensation as a second order phase transition , for higher @xmath95 values the incompressibility @xmath151 at the threshold is found to be negative ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "this represents a first order phase transition where we have employed the maxwell construction to maintain a positive compressibility .",
    "the static neutron star sequences representing the stellar masses @xmath152 and the corresponding central energy density @xmath153 are shown in fig . 6 for nucleons - only matter ( solid line ) and matter with further inclusion of @xmath5 condensate ( dashed line ) for several values of @xmath95 .",
    "with the occurrence of @xmath5 condensation , the maximum masses of neutron stars are reduced due to softening of the eos .",
    "the maximum masses @xmath154 and the central densities @xmath155 of the stars are listed in table iii .",
    "interestingly , it is observed that for @xmath156 mev , the threshold densities for neutral @xmath1 condensate occur before the central densities for the maximum mass stars .",
    "this implies that a significant region of these maximum mass stars will contain @xmath1 condensate along with @xmath0 condensate .",
    "note that for large values of @xmath95 , the requirement of maxwell construction causes a negligible variation of the masses ( and radii ) of the stars with central density .",
    "apart from the @xmath5 optical potential depth , the critical densities for antikaon condensation depend sensitively on the nuclear equation of state at high density .",
    "the gm1 set is obtained from a walecka - type lagrangian with a self - interaction term for the scalar meson .",
    "because of the linear density - dependence of the vector @xmath17-meson field , it was found that the vector potential overestimates the relativistic bruckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf ) results at high densities .",
    "bodmer @xcite first proposed an additional nonlinear @xmath17-meson term in the rmf model of the form @xmath157 later , it was found by sugahara and toki @xcite that this modification led to a reasonable agreement with the rbhf results .",
    "the model parameters obtained @xcite by fitting experimental data for binding energies and charge radii of heavy nuclei is referred to as tm1 .",
    "the parameters of this set are given in table i. the @xmath158 coupling constants @xmath94 for the tm1 set listed in table ii are found to be much smaller than gm1 .",
    "this stems from rather large @xmath159 potential of @xmath160 mev for the tm1 set compared to 72 mev for gm1 . in the tm1 set , for @xmath5 depths of @xmath109 mev , we obtain @xmath101 average scattering lengths and kaon optical potential depths of @xmath161 fm and @xmath162 mev . in this set even for @xmath163 mev ,",
    "the kaon optical potential depth is repulsive due to rather large @xmath164 in contrast to gm1 set .    the equation of state for nucleons - only star matter with and without antikaon condensation is shown in fig .",
    "7 for the tm1 set .",
    "in contrast to the gm1 set , the eos for @xmath165-matter at high densities is much softer here .",
    "this is due to @xmath166 variation of the vector potential compared to simple @xmath167 dependence in the gm1 set .",
    "due to a soft eos , the meson fields in the tm1 set vary rather slowly with density leading to delayed appearance of @xmath5 condensate ( see table iii ) . the stellar sequence for this set is shown in fig",
    "it is found that the masses of the stars with only nucleons and leptons are smaller than those in gm1 . on the contrary , with @xmath5 condensate the @xmath154 of stars for @xmath168 mev are in fact larger in the tm1 model compared to the gm1 set .",
    "the delayed formation of @xmath5 in this model suppresses the softening effect of antikaons .",
    "in particular , only for @xmath5 depth as large as @xmath169 mev , a @xmath1 condensate can be formed in the limiting mass star .",
    "the above study suggests that a stiffer eos is more efficient for antikaon condensation in neutron star matter .",
    "the small values of @xmath170 @xmath24 and @xmath171 with large @xmath172 mev in the tm1 set should have , in principle , provided a stiffer eos @xcite .",
    "however , the nonlinear @xmath17-meson term in this model entails a substantial softening of the eos at high densities . to investigate the effects of a rather stiff eos on @xmath5 condensation with acceptable nuclear matter properties ,",
    "we have generated another set of parameters using the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ( i.e. excluding the nonlinear @xmath17-meson term of eq . ( 28 ) ) and reproducing the saturation properties of the tm1 set .",
    "we call this set as gmt and it is presented in table i. it is to be noted that the coefficients @xmath173 in the sets gm1 and gmt are negative .",
    "this is associated with the well - known problem that the scalar potential is unbounded from below .",
    "we have however found that in these effective field theoretical models the equations of state for the two sets are continuous ( as are exhibited ) over a wide density range relevant to the neutron star interior .",
    "the @xmath94 coupling constants presented in table ii for the gmt set are nearly the same as tm1 .",
    "this arises from similar values of @xmath159 potential @xmath113 at saturation density although they should differ considerably at higher densities .",
    "for the same reason , the values of @xmath101 scattering lengths and @xmath4 optical potential depths at @xmath13 are almost identical in the tm1 and gmt sets .    in fig .",
    "9 , we display the variation of effective kaon mass @xmath7 ( top panel ) and @xmath5 condensate energies ( bottom panel ) for various values of @xmath95 for the gmt set .",
    "this should be contrasted with figs . 3 and 4 for the gm1 set .",
    "it is found that @xmath7 has a smaller decrement with density even for @xmath163 mev .",
    "therefore , the variation of @xmath17-meson field is chiefly responsible for the large drop in @xmath143 in the gmt set .",
    "the eos and the stellar sequences are shown in figs .",
    "10 and 11 with and without @xmath5 condensation .",
    "the results for the gmt set are summarized in table iv .",
    "the @xmath174 for nucleons - only stars is largest in the gmt set .",
    "since the eos is very stiff , the chemical potentials for nucleons increase rapidly with density which shift the threshold densities for @xmath5 condensation to much smaller values .",
    "we find that @xmath1 condensation occurs well inside the maximum mass stars for all values of @xmath95 , except for @xmath96 mev .",
    "to delineate the effects of @xmath1 condensation from @xmath0 , we also give in table iv the maximum masses and corresponding central densities for stars allowing only @xmath0 condensation .",
    "it is found that the softening due to @xmath1 condensate could reduce the maximum mass from that of the @xmath0 condensate further by @xmath175 at @xmath163 mev .",
    "the present investigation points to the fact that a stiff eos ( as for the gmt set ) favors strongly the formation of @xmath1 condensate in neutron stars .",
    "in other words , from g - parity one can infer that a soft eos would enhance kaon production .",
    "indeed , more kaon production was found @xcite in heavy ion collisions for a soft eos rather than a stiff one .",
    "we have discussed in fig .",
    "3 that @xmath0 condensation which occurs at earlier density than @xmath1 reduces the magnitude of the vector potentials . consequently , the effective energy @xmath21 of @xmath1 is enhanced shifting its threshold to a higher density .",
    "this effect is illustrated in table v where the stellar properties of stars having only @xmath1 condensate is considered .",
    "it is evident that @xmath1 formation takes place much earlier in the absence of @xmath0 condensate ( see tables iii and iv ) . since @xmath176 , sizeable amount of @xmath1 condensate would be present in stars for all @xmath5 optical potential depths in the gm1 and gmt sets .",
    "however , @xmath177 being higher than @xmath178 , and moreover , @xmath1 can not replace leptons in maintaining charge neutrality , the eos is stiffer and the maximum masses of the stars are larger here than those with @xmath0 condensate only .    in fig .",
    "12 , the mass - radius relationship is shown for nucleons - only stars and for stars with different values of @xmath95 for the gm1 , tm1 , and gmt sets .",
    "it is found that in all models the limiting mass stars without @xmath5 condensate have the largest maximum masses with smallest radii . with increasing @xmath5 optical potential depth",
    "although the maximum masses decrease , the corresponding radii are however found to be similar for most of the stars in the tm1 and gmt sets .",
    "in contrast , stars with smaller masses have larger radii in the gm1 set .",
    "we now briefly consider the case when hyperons are allowed in addition to nucleons . at higher densities",
    "when the fermi energy of nucleons exceeds the effective mass of a hyperon minus its associated interaction , the conversion of nucleons to hyperon is energetically favorable .",
    "the hyperon - meson coupling constants are obtained as discussed before . unless otherwise mentioned we use an attractive @xmath120 well - depth of @xmath179 mev . with this choice",
    "the @xmath118 and @xmath180 are the first two strange particles that appear at roughly the same density of @xmath181 in all the sets .",
    "more massive and positively charged particles than these appear at higher densities . since the conversion of nucleons to hyperons relieves the fermi pressure of nucleons , the equation of state",
    "is softened .",
    "the eoss for star matter with only nucleons and hyperons are depicted by dash - dotted lines in figs . 5 and 7 for the gm1 and tm1 sets .",
    "the maximum masses and the corresponding central densities are given in table iii .",
    "it is evident from the figures that the hyperons emerge at densities much earlier than the threshold density for @xmath5 condensate even for @xmath163 mev . since we have seen that a soft eos prevents @xmath5 condensation , the hyperons therefore postpone @xmath5 formation to higher densities .",
    "this effect is further accentuated because the negatively charged @xmath180 and @xmath123 can replace electrons in maintaining charge neutrality .",
    "the resulting drop in @xmath11 would mean a smaller value of @xmath8 is required for @xmath0 condensation which leads to higher threshold density .",
    "however , we find that in presence of hyperons the rate of decrease of the isovector potential is not so severe compared to that of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , in a hyperonic medium the shift in the threshold density for @xmath1 condensate is much smaller than that of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , in the gm1 set , the critical densities are @xmath182 and @xmath183 for @xmath129 mev .",
    "( this is to be compared with the results of table iii for stars with nucleons and antikaons . )",
    "these values are however beyond the central density of @xmath184 for maximum mass star containing all baryons but no antikaons . on the other hand , for @xmath142 mev",
    ", the critical densities of @xmath185 and @xmath186 imply that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensates will be present in hyperonic stars .",
    "this means that even though hyperons shift the threshold densities of @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensates to higher values , the possibility of finding hyperon stars with @xmath1 condensate ( in association with @xmath0 ) is enhanced for large @xmath5 optical potential depths .",
    "the standard mean field model used in the hyperon sector was found @xcite to be inadequate to describe the strongly attractive hyperon - hyperon interaction observed in double @xmath118-hypernuclei . since the core of a neutron star can be hyperon - rich @xcite ,",
    "the hyperon - hyperon interaction is expected to be important .",
    "this may be accounted by considering two additional mesons , the scalar meson @xmath187 ( denoted by @xmath188 hereafter ) and the vector meson @xmath189 which couple only to the hyperons ( @xmath116 ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is @xmath190 the @xmath191 couplings are obtained from the su(6 ) relation @xmath192 the @xmath193 couplings are obtained by fitting them to a well - depth @xmath194 for a @xmath116 in a @xmath195-bath @xcite .",
    "note that the nucleons do not couple to the strange mesons , i.e. @xmath196 . the eos and the star sequence are shown for this situation in figs . 5 and 6 ( dotted lines ) for the gm1 set without antikaons .",
    "the additional attraction imparted by the @xmath188 field makes the eos softer at moderately high densities . at very high densities",
    ", the eos merges with that without the strange mesons due to dominance of the repulsive @xmath197 field over the @xmath188 field .",
    "the maximum star mass obtained here is @xmath198 at a central density of @xmath199 .",
    "the rather large values of the meson fields ( @xmath200 ) in a hyperonic star should influence antikaon condensation densities . from the strangeness content of @xmath5 ( @xmath9-quark content )",
    "it is evident that the @xmath188 field is attractive and the @xmath197 field is repulsive for antikaons as also for the hyperons . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath201 coupling is obtained from the su(3 ) relation , @xmath202 , and the @xmath203 coupling from the @xmath187 decay , @xmath204 . with these couplings and for @xmath142 mev , we find that the relatively strong repulsive @xmath197 field in a hyperon - rich medium prevents antikaon condensation even at densities as large as @xmath205 ( in the gm1 set ) where the effective nucleon mass @xmath206 drops to zero @xcite . only for large @xmath5 optical depth of @xmath169 mev , and thereby large @xmath94 value , critical densities of @xmath207 and @xmath208 are reached .",
    "the above discussions of hyperonic star matter are confined to @xmath120-depth of @xmath179 mev .",
    "repulsive depth of @xmath122 mev has been also estimated @xcite .",
    "on refitting the scalar coupling @xmath209 to this depth and limiting to the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( 1 ) only , we find that in all the models @xmath180 formation occurs at a much higher density and the resulting eos is now stiffer compared to those with attractive @xmath120-depth .",
    "for example , in the gm1 set , a star of maximum mass @xmath210 is formed with a central density of @xmath211 .",
    "all the @xmath120 particles do not exist in this star while the @xmath123 occurs at a early density of @xmath212 .    in this paper ,",
    "we have employed the relativistic mean field model where the nucleon - meson coupling constants are fitted to certain bulk properties at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the model is then extended to high density regime to investigate the effects of antikaon condensation .",
    "the underlying assumption in the rmf models is that the meson field operators in the euler - lagrange equations are replaced by their mean values because the source terms in those equations increase with baryon density .",
    "also , the coupling constants of the rmf models are density independent .",
    "there are other approaches where gross properties of dense matter relevant to neutron stars are calculated in the framework of nonrelativistic brueckner - hartree - fock and variational chain summation ( vcs ) calculations using modern nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "recently , akmal , pandharipande and ravenhall ( apr ) @xcite have studied neutron star properties in the vcs method using a new argonne @xmath213 nucleon - nucleon interaction ( which fit all the data of the nijmegen data base ) with relativistic boost corrections and a fitted three - nucleon interaction .",
    "this calculation represents at present perhaps the most sophisticated many - body approach to dense matter .",
    "the bulk properties obtained in the apr model are binding energy @xmath214 mev , nuclear symmetry energy @xmath215 mev , and incompressibility @xmath216 mev at a saturation density of @xmath217 @xmath24 . to gauge the uncertainties involved in the extrapolation of the rmf model at high density , we compare the nucleons - only matter results with those of the apr model . for this purpose",
    "we use the model which contains nonlinear interaction for the scalar @xmath16-meson only .",
    "( note that the tm1 model which includes also self - interaction of @xmath17-meson is fitted to finite nuclear properties . )",
    "the five parameters in this rmf model are fitted to the above mentioned ( four ) saturation properties plus the effective nucleon mass of @xmath218 and 0.78 for the two representative cases considered here . in fig .",
    "13 we show the results for pure neutron matter ( pnm ) and symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) in the rmf model ( solid lines ) , and in the apr model with pion condensation ( dashed lines ) and their low density extrapolations without a pion condensed phase ( dotted lines ) @xcite .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the agreement between the two models breaks down at high density .",
    "the apr model takes into account possibly all leading many - body correlation effects .",
    "it was also demonstrated @xcite that the strong tensor correlation gives rise to neutral pion condensation in pnm and snm at densities of 0.20 @xmath24 and 0.32 @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the rmf model , however , can not address the question of density dependent correlation in dense matter , and moreover the coupling constants are density independent .",
    "this may be crucial to the deviation of the rmf results from the apr calculations .",
    "consequently , the threshold densities of antikaon condensation may be affected . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of the rmf models is that relativity is in - built and this causes the eos to be causal .",
    "however , in the apr model the eos becomes superluminal at densities close to the maximum masses of the stars .",
    "we have computed nucleons - only star masses using this parameter set in the rmf model . for the case",
    "@xmath218 , the maximum masses of the neutron star matter ( pure neutron matter ) are @xmath219 @xmath220 at central densities of @xmath221 ( 0.80 ) @xmath24 . for the case",
    "@xmath222 , the respective values are @xmath223 @xmath224 at @xmath225 ( 0.91 ) @xmath24 . comparing with the respective results of @xmath226 @xmath227 in the apr model with pion condensation , we find that in the rmf model the maximum mass of a neutron star is more sensitive to the amount of proton fraction .",
    "it was shown @xcite that a neutron star may cool rapidly by the so - called direct urca process in which neutrinos generated in the stars interior carry away the energy .",
    "the threshold density for this process depends on the symmetry energy which in turn is determined by the proton fraction . for the apr model the threshold is at a density of @xmath228 @xmath24 corresponding to a star of mass @xmath229 . in the rmf model , for @xmath218 and 0.78 , the threshold densities are respectively , 0.59 and 0.61 @xmath24 , which correspond to neutron stars of masses 2.09 and @xmath230 . the relatively rapid rise of symmetry energy with density manifests in a smaller threshold density for the direct urca process in the rmf models",
    ".    it may be worth mentioning that the role of nucleon - nucleon and kaon - nucleon correlations in kaon condensation in neutron star matter was studied by pandharipande et al . @xcite .",
    "the kaon energy for low density matter was calculated from lenz potential while at high density the hartree potential was used .",
    "the strong @xmath231 and @xmath101 correlations in the hartree potential were shown to lead to a dramatic reduction of the antikaon attraction at high densities that could raise the threshold density for antikaon condensation to much higher values . recently ,",
    "kaon energy in neutron matter has been calculated analytically @xcite by solving the klein - gordon equation in the wigner - seitz cell approximation .",
    "it was found that the transition from the low density lenz potential to a high density hartree potential occurs at @xmath232 .",
    "however , in a chiral perturbation theory , waas et al .",
    "@xcite found that short - range correlations has only a moderate effect on the antikaon condensation densities .",
    "we have investigated antikaon , @xmath0- and @xmath1-meson , condensation in neutron stars within a relativistic mean field approach where the interaction between the baryons and antikaons are generated by the exchange of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 mesons .",
    "three different parameter sets ( gm1 , tm1 , and gmt ) have been exploited in this calculation . in the gm1 and gmt",
    "sets the lagrangian contain self - interaction for @xmath16-meson only , while the set tm1 incorporates also nonlinear interaction for @xmath17-meson .",
    "the softest nuclear equation of state follows from tm1 set whereas the stiffest one from gmt set .",
    "we find that the critical densities for @xmath0 and in particular @xmath1 condensations depend sensitively on the choice of antikaon optical potential depth and more strongly on the nuclear equation of state .",
    "the threshold density of @xmath1 always lie above that of @xmath0 meson . with the appearance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensates , the overall equation of state",
    "becomes softer compared to the situation without antikaon condensation .",
    "this leads to a reduction in the maximum star masses . with the softest eos ( tm1 set )",
    ", @xmath1 condensate may be formed inside maximum mass stars only when the @xmath5 optical depth is quite large . on the other hand for the stiffest nuclear eos ( gmt set )",
    ", @xmath1 can occur well inside the maximum mass stars for rather small values of antikaon optical potential depth .",
    "the appearance of @xmath0 meson leads to a smaller variation of the vector fields with density .",
    "the decrease of @xmath1 energy with density is therefore attenuated resulting in its formation at higher density than in the case when @xmath0 meson is prohibited .",
    "with the onset of @xmath0 condensation ( neglecting @xmath1 meson ) , the proton fraction rises dramatically and even crosses the neutron fraction at some critical density . from the threshold conditions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 formations ,",
    "i.e. @xmath233 and @xmath234 , it is evident that the critical point of identical proton and neutron densities ( fermi momenta ) is precisely the density where @xmath1 formation sets in . in earlier model studies of @xmath0 condensation only ( where @xmath1 condensation were ignored ) , identical values of neutron and proton abundances",
    "were observed at high densities after @xmath0 condensation .",
    "it may therefore be instructive to revisit the antikaon condensation scenario including @xmath1 meson in these models . with the onset of @xmath1 condensation",
    ", there is a competition in the formation of @xmath235 and @xmath236 pairs resulting in a perfectly symmetric matter for nucleons and antikaons inside neutron stars .",
    "as the proton fraction is much enhanced in this situation , it may have profound implication on the cooling properties of neutron stars .    with the hyperon - meson couplings constants determined from hypernuclear data and @xmath114 symmetry relation ,",
    "the hyperons are formed earlier than antikaons .",
    "since the eos becomes softer , antikaon condensation can only occur at high densities .",
    "the negatively charged hyperons cause a larger reduction in the electron chemical potential compared to that of the isovector potential .",
    "this indicates that in contrast to nucleons only stars , @xmath1 has a higher formation probability in hyperonic stars , but only for relatively larger values of @xmath5 optical potential depth .",
    "for all the cases studied here , the maximum masses of the stars are found to be larger than the precise current observational lower limit of @xmath237 imposed by the larger mass of the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of high - frequency brightness oscillations in low - mass x - ray binaries provides a promising new avenue for determining masses and radii of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "large neutron star masses with an upper limit of @xmath238 have been extracted from kilohertz quasi - periodic - oscillations ( qpo ) .",
    "the present investigation suggests that indeed both @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensates are possible in stars of such large masses . on the other hand , hyperon degrees of freedom which lower the maximum mass considerably , would be clearly excluded in these massive stars .",
    "in contrast , also very small masses of @xmath239 have been accurately determined in binary pulsars @xcite .",
    "it is clear that exotic degrees of freedom like antikaons and hyperons must occur in these pulsars at few times the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "it has been inferred that large magnetic field @xmath240 g could exist at the core of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "though such large interior field is not accessible to direct observation , their existence could influence certain gross properties of neutron stars , such as cooling properties of the stars @xcite . recently , there has been a considerable debate about whether a charged bose gas in a constant magnetic field could exhibit a bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "some calculations ruled out such a possibility @xcite whereas others predicted that it could occur in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the formation of a bose - einstein condensate of neutral bose gas such as a system of @xmath1 in a strong magnetic field may be an interesting possibility .",
