    "strongly correlated low - dimensional quantum systems have attracted much attention during the last years since they can serve as a testing ground for theoretical concepts which are believed to play a key role in understanding materials of paramount technological potential like the high-@xmath1 superconductors or the cmr ( colossal magnetoresistance ) manganites.@xcite this applies in particular to one - dimensional systems for which exactly solvable many - body models exist.@xcite meanwhile the narrowed view on the isolated subsystems , e.g. the electron system , has given way to a synopsis of the complex interplay between _ all _ relevant degrees of freedom , i.e. charge , spin , orbitals , and lattice . in this perspective , the layered mott insulator tiocl has recently aroused a lot of interest .",
    "tiocl crystallizes in an orthorhombic quasi - two - dimensional structure of the feocl type , where buckled bilayers of ti - o are separated by cl ions.@xcite the bilayers , which are stacked along the crystallographic @xmath2-axis , only weakly interact through van der waals forces . in a local picture , the electronic structure is determined by the octahedral coordination of the ti ion in a 3@xmath3 configuration .",
    "the strongly distorted octahedra are formed by four o and two cl ions , and share corners along the @xmath4-axis and edges along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "thus , the low - lying charge excitations occur within the ti  3@xmath5  @xmath6 triplet .",
    "this simple picture is essentially confirmed by lda+u calculations,@xcite which identify the @xmath7 derived band as slightly split off from the bands with @xmath8 and @xmath9 character.@xcite both the lda+u results as well as the observation of a bonner - fisher - type magnetic susceptibility at high temperatures indicate the existence of spin-1/2 heisenberg chains in this material , mediated by direct exchange along the @xmath0-axis ( @xmath10k).@xcite correspondingly , the sudden drop of the susceptibility at @xmath11k to almost zero and a kink anomaly at @xmath12k have been discussed in terms of an unusual first - order spin - peierls transition and possibly some kind of precursor transition , respectively . while the dimerized nature of the ground state indeed could be proven by x - ray diffraction,@xcite the results from magnetic resonance,@xcite raman@xcite and infrared spectroscopy,@xcite and specific heat measurements@xcite point to the importance of strong spin and/or orbital fluctuations in the high - temperature phase up to 130k . in partial contradiction",
    ", there is recent evidence from cluster calculations in connection with polarization - dependent optical data that the orbital degrees of freedom are actually quenched.@xcite based on ginzburg - landau arguments it was concluded that the frustration of the interchain interactions in the bilayers give rise to incommensurate order in the intermediate phase , which commensurately locks in below @xmath13 .",
    "such behavior has indeed been observed in the related compound tiobr.@xcite still , a complete understanding of the relevant competing interactions in this compound demands for a thorough investigation of the electronic properties in the normal state .",
    "this seems particularly interesting under the perspective of doping charge carriers into the system to drive the chains metallic and possibly even superconducting.@xcite    in this paper we focus on the normal state electronic properties of tiocl at room - temperature and slightly above , _",
    "i.e. _ well above the transition temperatures @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to this end",
    "we performed polarization dependent angle - resolved photoemission measurements ( arpes ) which provide momentum - resolved information on the electronic structure .",
    "the experiments are complemented by lda+u and hubbard model calculations .",
    "our photoemission data confirm the one - dimensionality of the electronic structure and give no evidence for any significant ( phonon - induced ) admixtures of @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals to the ground state , implying that orbital fluctuations play no role for the low - temperature physics of tiocl .",
    "nevertheless , the detailed comparison of the experimental results to our electronic structure calculations as well as to recent lda+dmft calculations show that even the normal state properties of tiocl are far from being fully understood .",
    "single crystals of tiocl were prepared by chemical vapor transport from ticl@xmath15 and tio@xmath16.@xcite the samples were characterized by x - ray diffraction , specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , and electron spin resonance measurements .",
    "the high quality of our crystals can be directly inferred from the susceptibility data displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , in which a pronounced hysteresis at @xmath13 signals the first - order character of the lower transition .",

    "additional polarization experiments with linearly polarized synchrotron light were performed at the sis beamline of the swiss light source at the paul - scherrer - institute ( villigen , switzerland ) using a scienta ses 100 analyzer .",
    "the energy and angular resolution amounted for the homelab experiments to 60mev and @xmath18 , respectively , and to 80mev and @xmath19 in the sls experiments .",
    "the layered structure of tiocl facilitates easy surface preparation by _ in situ _ crystal cleavage .",
    "the resulting surfaces were clean and atomically long - range ordered as evidenced by x - ray induced photoemission ( xps ) and low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) , respectively . because tiocl is an insulator ,",
    "all photoemission data were taken at room temperature or above in order to minimize sample charging . from systematic temperature - variations we found that the charging is almost negligible at and above @xmath20k .",
    "in this situation the maximum of the ti  @xmath21-peak ( see below ) is located at 1.45ev below the experimental chemical potential @xmath22 , which corresponds to the fermi edge position of a silver foil .",
    "spectra measured at lower temperatures have been aligned accordingly .      on the theoretical side ,",
    "we have determined the electronic structure of tiocl by performing density functional theory ( dft ) calculations in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite and in the so - called lda(gga)+u approximation@xcite using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave code wien2k.@xcite since the lda+u calculations are performed on a spin - polarized state , we considered a ferromagnetic alignment of the ti spins ( fm ) as well as an antiferromagnetic arrangement of the ti spins along the @xmath0 direction ( afm ) .",
    "the latter was found to be lower in total energy compared to the fm state.@xcite we also performed lda+u calculations for the low - temperature crystal structure of tiocl@xcite in an antiferromagnetically spin - polarized state . in all calculations we used @xmath23 and @xmath24k irreducible points for brillouin - zone integrations .",

    "@xmath28ev , respectively,@xcite which accounts well for the intersite chain exchange constant derived from the magnetic susceptibility .      to better account for correlation effects beyond the lda+u approach we have also determined the one - particle spectral function of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model at half band - filling using the dynamical density - matrix renormalisation group ( ddmrg ) method .",
    "@xcite the calculations were performed on 32-site chains with open boundaries and we kept up to 200 density - matrix eigenstates .",
    "the broadening of the spectra is @xmath29=0.2 .",
    "( color online ) angle - integrated photoemission spectra and lda+u density of states for a ferromagnetic spin - polarized state .",

    "the small intensity differences between the ups and xps data are due to different photoemission cross sections .",
    "also shown is the occupied part of the density of states ( dos ) obtained from the lda+u calculation for the room - temperature structure assuming ferromagnetic spin alignment ( lda+u@xmath30 ) . from the comparison of theory and experiment",
    "we identify the low - binding energy peak as ti @xmath21-like , whereas the states between @xmath31ev and @xmath32ev are predominantly derived from cl @xmath33 and o @xmath34 levels .",
    "the overall shape of the theoretical dos and the experimental spectra are rather similar .",
    "note , however , that the lda+u dos is shifted to higher binding energy in order to align the theoretical and experimental ti @xmath21 peaks .",
    "with this alignment the relative separation between ti @xmath21 and the ligand @xmath35 states still appears @xmath36ev too small .",

    "[ figure3 ] , the experimental @xmath21 spectrum has a similar asymmetry as the lda+u@xmath30 dos but is much broader .",
    "we emphasize that the experimental width is perfectly reproducible and _ not _ due to instrumental broadening , which is much smaller . a comparison to the lda+u dos for _ antiferromagnetic _ spin configuration ( which seems the more natural choice considering the bonner - fisher - type susceptibility ) yields an even stronger disagreement .",
    "we note that lda+u accounts for the onsite coulomb interaction only in a mean - field way and is thus effectively still a one - electron theory for static ordered systems .",
    "one may thus speculate that the origin for the conflicting @xmath21 widths lies in pronounced electronic correlation effects and/or fluctuations of spin - peierls or orbital nature beyond the scope of lda+u .",
    "electronic correlation effects can in principle be accounted for by a combination of lda and dynamical mean field theory ( lda+dmft ) or by suitable many - body models .",

    "the lda+dmft calculations are taken from refs .   and and used different impurity solvers and basis sets .",
    "while the lda+dmft curves indeed display a broadening much closer to that of the experiment , none of these curves can sufficiently explain the shape of the experimental data .",
    "the striking disagreement between the two lda+dmft calculations should probably be traced back to the fact that , contrary to the multi - orbital qmc solver , the ipt solver is quite uncertain for anisotropic multi - band problems,@xcite as it is the case for tiocl .",

    "both data sets are displayed in two alternative ways : as intensity plots @xmath41 , and as energy distribution curves ( edcs ) .",
    "as seen , there is well - pronounced dispersion particularly in the cl @xmath33/o @xmath34 part of the spectra between @xmath31ev and @xmath32ev .",
    "this behavior and the clear symmetry of the dispersions with respect to the @xmath42 point is indicative of the good crystal surface quality .",
    "( color online ) ti @xmath21 part of the edcs along the crystallographic axes @xmath4 and @xmath0.,width=309 ]    figure  [ figure5 ] shows an enlargement of the ti @xmath21 arpes spectra . from a comparison of the bare edcs",
    "one can easily see that the spectral changes along the @xmath0-axis are considerably stronger than along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "this observation confirms the quasi - one - dimensional electronic ( and magnetic ) nature of tiocl and corroborates the lda+u prediction@xcite that are formed by direct hopping via ti @xmath39 orbitals along the @xmath0 direction .",
    "we note , however , that the dispersion along the @xmath4-axis is still finite as seen from a closer inspection of the @xmath43-dependence of the peak maximum , which moves to slightly higher binding energy from @xmath42 to x. the size of the @xmath4-axis dispersion is directly related to the interchain coupling , which may play an important role for the complex spin - peierls transition behavior.@xcite a comparison of the experimental @xmath4-axis dispersion to that of the lda+u@xmath30 calculation is displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] and yields qualitative agreement concerning size and direction of the dispersion .",
    "note again , however , that the lda+u bands had to be shifted in energy to give a good match to the arpes data .",

    "[ figure5 ] ) .",
    "they start out at @xmath42 with a single peak at @xmath44ev below the chemical potential . with increasing momentum the peak shifts clearly towards @xmath22 and reaches its smallest binding energy about halfway between @xmath42 and the zone edge .",
    "for even larger momentum the peak rapidly drops in intensity and seems to move back to slightly higher binding energy . at the same time a new feature appears at @xmath45ev until at the zone boundary ( y ) the spectral shape has evolved into a broad hump .",
    "this behavior and the relatively large broadening of these structures have been reproducibly observed on many different samples and is hence to be taken as intrinsic .",
    "figure  [ figure7 ] shows the experimental @xmath0-axis dispersion as arpes intensity plot in comparison with various theoretical calculations . starting with the theoretical lda+u@xmath30 dispersion calculated for the high - temperature ( non - dimerized ) structure we find pronounced disagreement with the experiment , particularly in the second half of the @xmath42y direction where the theoretical bands continue to disperse upwards , whereas the experimental dispersion turns over and bends downwards until at the y - point the spectral weight distribution is strongly broadened and seems to reach even higher binding energy than at @xmath42 . using antiferromagnetic spin alignment in the lda+u approach doubles the unit cell and hence results in a dispersion symmetric about @xmath46y ( center panel of fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ) .",
    "although lda+u@xmath47 thus reproduces the dispersion maximum halfway along @xmath42y , it does clearly not account for the asymmetric experimental behavior and the strong broadening towards the y - point .",
    "motivated by speculations that the unusual high - temperature behavior of tiocl could be caused by fluctuations of the spin - peierls order parameter , fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] shows lda+u@xmath47 dispersions for the dimerized low - temperature phase.@xcite we note that such fluctuation effects have been observed in _",
    "peierls systems well above the actual transition temperature.@xcite however , as is evident from the figure , the effect of ( fluctuating ) dimerization results in band doubling but is otherwise rather small and hence can not explain the phenomenology of the arpes data .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] finally displays the momentum - resolved spectral weight distribution of the 1d single - band hubbard model , calculated within ddmrg for the @xmath25 and @xmath48 parameters of the lda+u calculations .",
    "we note that in this case the spectra are entirely of incoherent nature and correspond to momentum - dependent continua , which are structured in intensity due to the phase space available for decomposition of a real ( photo-)hole into separate collective spinon and holon excitations . as a consequence a number of different dispersive structures appear , whose detailed ( non - quasiparticle ) nature are discussed in , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .   and .",
    "comparing the ddmrg result with our arpes data we find several corresponding features such as the initial upward dispersion ( due to spin and charge branches in the hubbard model @xcite ) , the dispersion maximum at @xmath46y , and the asymmetric shift of weight to larger binding energy towards the y - point .",
    "also the overall energy width of the spectral weight distribution is greater than in the lda+u calculations . on the other hand",
    ", the experiment does not show the pronounced spin - charge splitting between @xmath42 and @xmath46y predicted by ddmrg , nor the holon `` shadow band '' @xcite which in the hubbard model spectrum disperses downwards from @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , we calculated the spectral functions of two closely related hubbard - type models in the mott - insulating phase : the extended hubbard model which includes a next - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath49 and the @xmath48-@xmath50-@xmath25 model@xcite that takes into account a next - neighbor hopping @xmath50 .",
    "the resulting spectral functions ( not shown ) for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , display no qualitative differences compared to the simple hubbard model spectral function .",
    "however , the spectral weight of the spin branch in the @xmath48-@xmath50-@xmath25 model is significantly reduced for appropriate parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath54)@xcite .",
    "this may indicate why the spin - charge splitting is not resolved experimentally .",
    "overall , the agreement is much better for our hubbard model calculations than for the lda+u band dispersions , suggesting that the experimental spectra are indeed dominated by electronic correlation effects .",
    "we note , however , that we can not really expect the 1d single - band hubbard model to account fully for our spectra , as it completely ignores the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the crystal - field splitting between the @xmath7 ground state and the excited @xmath55 states is only a few 100mev@xcite and hence virtual excitations into these states will be even more important than the double occupations on the same site ( with energy scale @xmath38ev ) already contained in the single - band model .",
    "therefore , it would be highly desirable to compare our arpes spectra to that of a suitable multi - orbital 1d hubbard model which however is still out of reach for the ddmrg .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , the high - temperature phase of tiocl is characterized by anomalous broadening of the phonon lines in raman and infrared spectroscopy.@xcite this indicates strong coupling of the lattice to the electronic ( spin or orbital ) degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , lda+u calculations for frozen lattice distortions corresponding to the relevant phonon modes have shown that the orbital ground state may switch from @xmath39 to @xmath56 for sufficiently large amplitude.@xcite such a dynamical jahn - teller effect would lead to an orbitally mixed character of the time - averaged ground state .",
    "experimental information on orbital symmetry can be obtained from polarization - dependent arpes , making use of selection rules realized for special experimental geometries .",
    "assume the direction of the incident linearly polarized light and the emission direction of the photoelectrons lie within the same crystal mirror plane .",
    "then with the polarization vector within and perpendicular to the mirror plane the ejected electrons can stem only from states with well - defined even or odd parity with respect to this plane , respectively.@xcite if we choose the experimental setup as sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] the @xmath7-derived band states of tiocl are even with respect to the ( @xmath0,@xmath2 ) mirror plane while the @xmath55 states are odd",
    ". with the ( @xmath0,@xmath2)-plane lying horizontally , photoemission from the @xmath7 states is hence dipole - allowed only for horizontal light polarization , whereas @xmath55-emission can be observed for vertical polarization only .",
    "( color online ) photoemission spectra measured at the @xmath42-point with horizontal and vertical light polarization , respectively ( t=300k ) .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding photoemission spectra measured at another photon energy ( t=365k ) .",
    "the experimental setup is sketched in the upper left corner.,width=302 ]    in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] we display the results of such an arpes experiment obtained with 21.2ev photons at room temperature .",
    "the spectra were recorded at normal emission ( _ i.e. _ , at the @xmath42 point ) with horizontal ( blue ) and vertical ( red ) polarization , respectively .",
    "since a laboratory he lamp with a rotatable polarizer was used , the photon flux is not changed by switching the polarization and the spectra can be normalized to equal integration times per channel . at first glance , one can see that the intensity distribution over the whole valence band indeed is strongly affected by polarization effects .",
    "focussing on the ti  3@xmath5 states reaching down to about 3.5ev below @xmath57 their spectral weight is significantly reduced but not completely suppressed upon switching the polarization from horizontal to vertical , indicating the dominance of @xmath7 emission . the residual @xmath58 weight for vertical polarization",
    "can be quantitatively accounted for by the finite degree of light polarization ( @xmath59% ) , possible small sample misalignment and the effect of thermally activated symmetry - breaking phonons.@xcite similar data for the ti  3@xmath5 derived part of the electronic structure using polarized synchrotron radiation is depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] .",
    "these spectra were recorded at a photon energy of 110ev and a temperature @xmath60k and normalized to equal photon flux . due to the higher polarization degree of the synchrotron radiation the residual relative weight for vertical polarization",
    "is even further reduced .",
    "we note that this contribution does not vary down to room temperature within experimental accuracy again indicating that phonon - induced orbital fluctuations are not important in this temperature range .",
    "hence we have direct experimental evidence that there is no sizable dynamical jahn - teller admixture of @xmath8 and @xmath9 states to the @xmath7 ground state at room temperature .",
    "this is in line with the reasoning based on recent cluster calculations combined with polarization - dependent optical data@xcite , although such an effect can not be excluded for far higher temperatures .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the electronic structure of tiocl by means of angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy at and slightly above room temperature . from those measurements we confirm the predicted quasi - one - dimensional nature of the low - lying energy excitations .",
    "however , the electron dispersions along the one - dimensional axis can not be explained by lda+u or ddmrg calculations of the one - dimensional single - band hubbard model . from the specific polarization dependence of the ti  3@xmath5 spectral weight close to the chemical potential sizeable phonon - induced admixtures of @xmath8 and @xmath9 derived states to the @xmath7 ground state",
    "can be ruled out .",
    "thus a scenario where the non - canonical behavior of the spin - peierls transition in this compound is traced back to orbital fluctuations within a dynamical jahn - teller scenario does not seem plausible .",
    "we are indebted to v.  n.  strocov and l.  patthey for their support at the swiss light source and to m.  knupfer and s.  borisenko for the loan of their experimental end station .",
    "we would also like to thank h.  rosner for useful discussions and a.  hartmann for technical assistance .",
