    "most of existing data on neutrino oscillations from the solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator experiments have established a framework of neutrino oscillations among three flavor neutrinos through the mixing of three mass eigenstates .",
    "atmospheric sector flavor conversion was first established by the super - kamiokande  @xcite and macro  @xcite experiments and then confirmed by the k2k  @xcite and minos  @xcite long - baseline experiments .",
    "the hypothesis of @xmath0 oscillation origin is fitting well all the data .",
    "moreover , the chooz  @xcite and palo verde  @xcite reactor experiments ruled out indirectly the @xmath2 channel as the dominant mode in the atmospheric sector .",
    "it is important to note that all of the experiments yielded positive evidence for neutrino oscillations on the disappearance of muon neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino flux , with no explicit observation of the appearance of tau neutrinos and their charged current ( cc ) interactions .",
    "the main goal of the opera experiment  @xcite is to perform a unique appearance observation of the oscillation products to confirm unambiguously the neutrino oscillation hypothesis in the atmospheric sector through the @xmath0 channel .",
    "although the neutrino beam is not optimized for it , opera is performing a study on subleading @xmath3 oscillation search at atmospheric and high @xmath4 .    in the following ,",
    "the neutrino beam , the opera detector with its performances and the event - by - event analysis stream will be briefly reviewed .",
    "the neutrino oscillation results both on @xmath0 and @xmath3 will be discussed .",
    "in order to study @xmath5 oscillations in appearance mode in the atmospheric neutrino sector , the cern neutrinos to gransasso ( cngs ) neutrino beam  @xcite was designed and optimized by maximizing the number of @xmath6 cc interactions at the gran sasso underground laboratory ( lngs )  @xcite .",
    "the average @xmath7 beam energy is 17 gev , well above tau production energy treshold .",
    "the @xmath8 contamination is @xmath9 in flux , @xmath10 in terms of interactions .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 contaminations are lower than @xmath13 , while the number of prompt @xmath6 from @xmath14 decay is negligible , @xmath15 .",
    "the average @xmath16 ratio is 43 km / gev , suitable for oscillation studies at atmospheric @xmath17 .",
    "the cngs completed its operation before the 2013 cern accelerator complex shut - down on december 3 , 2012 .",
    "a total number of @xmath18 protons on target ( pots ) was accumulated since the beginning of the program in 2008 .",
    "it corresponds to 80% of the cngs beam originally foreseen , @xmath19 pots in 5 years .",
    "the neutrino beam produced by the cern - sps is directed towards the opera detector , located in the lngs in italy , 730 km away from the neutrino source .",
    "the challenge of the experiment is the detection of the short lived @xmath20 lepton ( c@xmath21=87 @xmath22 m , decay length @xmath231 mm at the average cngs beam energy ) produced in the cc interaction of @xmath24 .",
    "the detector should match a large target mass to collect enough statistics and a very high spatial resolution to observe the @xmath21 lepton with high rejection power to limit background contamination .",
    "therefore , the opera detector was designed as an hybrid detector made of two identical super modules ( sm1 and sm2 ) , each one formed by a target section and a muon spectrometer .",
    "the muon spectrometer is used to reconstruct and identify muons from @xmath25 cc interactions and measure their momentum and charge .",
    "each target section is organized in 31 vertical `` @xmath26 '' , transverse to the beam direction .",
    "walls are filled with emulsion cloud chamber units,``@xmath27 @xmath28 '' , with an overall mass of 1.25 kton . each wall",
    "is followed by double layers of scintillator planes , the target trackers ( tt ) , used to locate neutrino interactions occurred within the target .",
    "an ecc brick consists of 56 lead plates of 1 mm thickness interleaved with 57 emulsion films .",
    "the lead plates serve as neutrino interaction target and the emulsion films as three - dimensional ( 3d ) tracking detectors providing track coordinates with a sub - micron accuracy and track angles with a few mrad accuracy which is ideal for @xmath6 interaction detection .",
    "the material of a brick along the beam direction corresponds to about 10 radiation lengths and 0.33 interaction length .",
    "the brick size is 10@xmath2912.5@xmath298 @xmath30 and its weight is about 8.3 kg .",
    "the brick as stand alone detector also allows the momentum measurement of charged particles by multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) and the separation of low energy @xmath31 and @xmath22 by @xmath32 measurements .",
    "electromagnetic showers can be detected and unambigouously attributed to electrons , @xmath33s or @xmath34 .",
    "the experimental apparatus and techniques are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "all the events triggered by the neutrino beam spill the so - called `` on - time '' events , in coincidence with the two 10.5  @xmath22s long cngs spills distant of 50  ms are considered for neutrino oscillation studies .",
    "neutrino event analysis starts with the pattern recognition in the electronic detectors .",
    "charged particle tracks produced in a neutrino interaction generate signals in the tt and in the muon spectrometer .",
    "these signals are used to classify the event as cc - like or neutral current ( nc ) , like interactions based on the presence of at least a 3d reconstructed track idenfied as a muon in the event@xmath35 , the event is classified as cc - like . ] .",
    "an automatic algorithm is applied to all on - time events in order to select the events contained in the emulsion target .",
    "a brick finding algorithm is applied then to select the brick with the maximum probability to contain the neutrino interaction which is extracted from the detector by an automated system , the brick manipulator system .    after extraction , the brick is validated by analysing the changeable sheet ( cs )  @xcite doublet of films externally attached to it .",
    "the signal recorded in the cs films confirms the prediction of the electronic detector , or acts as veto and triggers a search in neighbouring bricks to find the correct ecc where the neutrino interaction has occured .",
    "the measurement of emulsion films is performed through high - speed automated microscopes  @xcite with a sub - micrometric position resolution and an angular resolution of the order of one milliradian .",
    "if there is not any cs track compatible with the electronic detector tracks related to the event , the brick is returned back to the detector with a new cs doublet attached and the next brick in the probability list is extracted .",
    "this method allows to save the analysis time of the brick and minimize the loss of target mass .",
    "if any track originating from the interaction is detected in the cs , the brick is exposed to cosmic rays ( for alignment purposes ) and then depacked .",
    "the emulsion films are developed and sent to the scanning laboratories of the collaboration for event location studies and decay search analysis .",
    "all track information from the cs analysis is used for a precise prediction of the tracks in the most downstream film of the brick ( with an accuracy of about 100 @xmath22 m ) . when found in this film ,",
    "tracks are followed back from film to film .",
    "the scan - back procedure is stopped when no track candidate is found in three consecutive films ; the lead plate just upstream the last detected track segment is defined as the vertex plate . in order to study the located vertices and reconstruct the events ,",
    "a general scanning volume is defined with a transverse area of 1@xmath291 @xmath36 along 5 films upstream and 10 films downstream of the stopping point .",
    "all track segments in this volume are collected and analysed .",
    "after rejection of the passing through tracks related to cosmic rays and of the tracks due to low energy particles , the tracks produced by the neutrino interaction can be selected and reconstructed .      once the neutrino interaction is located ( mainly in lead plates ) ,",
    "a decay search procedure is applied to detect possible short / long decays or interaction topologies on tracks attached to the primary vertex . for short decays , about 60% , the @xmath21 decays in the same lead plate in which the neutrino interaction occurs .",
    "the main signature of a @xmath21 candidate is the observation of a track with a significant impact parameter ( ip ) relative to the neutrino interaction vertex .",
    "the ip of primary tracks is smaller than 10 @xmath22 m after excluding tracks produced by low momentum particles . for long decays , about 40% ,",
    "the candidate event is selected on the basis either of the existence of a clear `` kink''(@xmath37 > 20 mrad ) or of a secondary multiprong vertex from the decay in flight of a particle emerging from the neutrino interaction vertex .    when secondary vertices or kink topologies are found in the event , a kinematical analysis is performed , based on particle angles and momenta measured in the emulsion films . for charged particles up to about 6 gev / c",
    ", momenta can be determined using the angular deviations produced by mcs of tracks in the lead plates with a resolution better than @xmath38  @xcite . for higher momentum particles ,",
    "the measurement is based on the position deviations .",
    "the resolution is better than @xmath39 on 1/p up to 12 gev / c for particles crossing an entire brick .",
    "a @xmath33-ray search is performed in the whole scanned volume by checking all tracks having an ip with respect to the primary or secondary vertices smaller than 800 @xmath22 m .",
    "the angular acceptance is @xmath40 mrad .",
    "the @xmath33-ray energy is estimated by a neural network algorithm that uses the number of segments , the shape of the electromagnetic shower and also the mcs of the leading particles .",
    "the identification of an electron is essentially based on the detection of the associated electromagnetic shower .",
    "since the size of the standard scanning volume is generally too short in the beam direction to contain the electromagnetic shower , a special electron - id scan is performed on nc - like located events by extending the scanning volume .",
    "all primary tracks are extrapolated to the cs and the existence of electromagnetic shower associated to that tracks are investigated .",
    "if 3 or more tracks are found in the cs within 150 mrad angular and 2 mm spatial tolerances , around a given primary track , an additional volume along the candidate track is scanned . if the automatic algorithm based on a neural network reconstructs an electromagnetic shower , and if the primary track initiating the shower is recognized as a single track on the vertex emulsion film , the event is classified as a @xmath41 candidate event .",
    "the results are based on the analysis of the first two years of data ( 2008 - 2009 ) , which is completed  @xcite , and of a 2010 - 2011 data sub - sample . for the sample currently under analysis and",
    "accumulated during the runs from 2010 to 2012 , a pre - selection is applied that includes all nc - like events and cc - like events with a muon momentum below 15 gev / c . at the time of the conference",
    ", 4505 neutrino interactions were fully analysed looking for decay topologies : two @xmath24 neutrino events were found . at the time of writing these proceedings , with the extension of the analysed sample to events with one @xmath22 in the final state",
    "a third @xmath21 candidate , coming from @xmath21 lepton decays to muon channel , was detected  @xcite .",
    "a systematic search of @xmath41 interaction was applied to 505 nc - like located events from 2008 - 2009 data , 19 @xmath41 candidates were detected .    in the following section ,",
    "the results of the oscillation analyses are presented .",
    "the @xmath6 signature is given by the decay topology and kinematics of the short lived @xmath20 leptons produced in the interaction of @xmath42 and decaying to one prong ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) or three prongs , which are  @xcite : @xmath45      the first @xmath24 candidate was observed in the 2008 - 2009 data sample and described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the event has seven prongs at the primary vertex , out of which four are identified as originating from a hadron and three have a probability lower than 0.1% of being a muon , none being left by an electron .",
    "the parent track exhibits a kink topology and the daughter track is identified as produced by a hadron through its interaction .",
    "its impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex is ( 55@xmath464 ) @xmath22 m while the ip is smaller than 7 @xmath22 m for the other tracks .",
    "two @xmath33-rays have been found pointing to the secondary vertex .",
    "the kinematical measurements of the interaction products passed all the selection cuts described in detail in the experiment proposal  @xcite .",
    "all the kinematical variables of the event and the cuts applied are given in table  [ tab : kinematicfirst ] .",
    "the invariant mass of the two observed @xmath33-rays is @xmath47 mev / c@xmath48 supporting the hypothesis that they are emitted in a @xmath34 decay . the invariant mass of the charged decay daughter assumed to be a @xmath49 and of the two @xmath33-rays amount to @xmath50 mev / c@xmath48 , which is compatible with the @xmath51 mass .",
    "so the decay mode of the candidate is consistent with the hypothesis @xmath52 .",
    ".kinematical variables of the first @xmath6 candidate event with specified criteria for @xmath53hadron decay channel .

    "they have lifetimes similar to that of the @xmath21 lepton and have most of the decay topologies in common .",
    "these considerations show how the study of the production of charmed particles in the opera experiment is useful to validate the procedures used for the selection and identification of @xmath24 interaction candidates .",
    "the number of charm decays found so far in the data taken from 2008 - 2011 is 49 with an expectation of 51@xmath467.5 events .",
    "the statistical significance of the observation of two @xmath24 candidate events is under evaluation , along with the recomputation of efficiencies for signal and background , taking into account different sample selections .",
    "the preliminary number of expected @xmath24 in the analysed data sample is 2.1 , with preliminary background estimation of 0.2 events .",
    "thanks to the capability of electron identification and to the small contamination of @xmath11 in the cngs neutrino beam , the experiment has also performed a @xmath1 oscillation search  @xcite .",
    "the experiment searched for the appearance of @xmath41 in the cngs neutrino beam using the data collected in 2008 and 2009 , corresponding to an integrated intensity of 5.25 @xmath29 10@xmath54 pot .",

    "19 @xmath41 candidate events were detected with an expectation of 19.4@xmath462.8 ( syst ) events from beam contamination and 1.4 event from oscillation .",
    "apart from the beam contamination , two main sources of background are considered for @xmath41 search : ( 1 ) @xmath55 misidentified as an electron in neutrino interactions without a reconstructed muon , and ( 2 ) @xmath24 cc interactions with the decay of the @xmath21 into an electron .",
    "the first background contribution has been evaluated directly from the data and it was found to be 0.2@xmath460.2 event . while the second one computed by mc simulation assuming @xmath0 oscillation in a three flavour neutrino mixing scenario using up - to - date oscillation parameters ; the background was found to be 0.3@xmath460.1 .",
