    "tidal interactions in highly eccentric close binary systems primarily excite low order quadrupole gravity modes ( g - modes ) and the fundamental mode ( f - mode ) , because these modes have periods comparable to the periastron passage time and their eigenfunctions have the largest overlap with the tidal forcing field [ @xcite ] .",
    "the dissipation time scale for these modes , for main sequence stars , are @xmath11 years or greater .",
    "a long damping time typically leads to a larger mode amplitude for modes that are subjected to repeated tidal forcing , but perhaps more interestingly offers the possibility that in tidal interactions energy can be transferred from the modes to the orbit as well as from the orbit to the modes , causing a chaotic evolution of the orbit [ @xcite ] in some cases . in the case of tidal capture binaries ,",
    "this process can lead to ionization of the system in subsequent encounters [ @xcite , @xcite . ]",
    "given the large amplitudes of modes in close binary systems , one expects nonlinear interactions amongst modes carrying most of the energy and others , which are tidally not excited , to be an important process of draining energy from the primary modes .",
    "we investigate this process and assess its significance in close binary systems .",
    "the next section describes the basic equations for mode couplings and discusses the most significant nonlinear process for energy transfer from modes of a radiative star . in section  3 we discuss the nonlinear mode couplings for a convective star .",
    "applications to tidal capture are discussed in  4 , and our main results are summarized in  5 .",
    "the details of the calculation of nonlinear coupling coefficients are presented in appendix a.",
    "the leading - order nonlinear interactions of stellar modes are 3-mode couplings .",
    "these can be derived by expanding the lagrangian density for adiabatic motions in powers of the fluid displacement . if the expansion is truncated at second order , the standard euler - lagrange procedure yields linear equations of motion , which one solves for the normal modes .",
    "when the third - order parts of the lagrangian density are retained , the equations of motion for the mode amplitudes contain quadratic terms : @xmath12 where @xmath13 & @xmath14 are mode frequency and amplitude .",
    "the 3-mode coupling coefficient , @xmath15 , is completely symmetric in the three indices .",
    "it is obtained by substituting the normal mode expansion of fluid displacement into the cubic lagrangian density , and integrating over the stellar interior ( see appendix a ) . since",
    "our eigenfunctions are normalized to unit energy , the energy in mode @xmath16 is @xmath17 .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : gen ] ) with its right side set to zero describes free normal modes of oscillation .",
    "we could represent tidal forcing by adding a term independent of the amplitudes , but in this paper we are concerned with the evolution of the modes after forcing has ceased .",
    "we assume that initially all the pulsation energy resides in a few low order modes . if the star has a radiative core , then these modes couple to high degree g - modes and transfer energy away by parametric resonance instability .",
    "this is discussed in the next sub - section . even for completely convective stars nonlinear energy transfer , involving non - resonant 3-mode interaction with high frequency p - modes",
    ", can be an important process and is discussed in  3 .",
    "parametric instability arises when a mode is nonlinearly coupled to another mode of approximately twice the frequency , or more generally when two low frequency modes of infinitesimal amplitude couple to a higher frequency mode of finite amplitude . to analyze this case",
    "we consider a single triplet interaction involving modes @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "expressing mode amplitudes in the following complex notation @xmath20 and substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : gen ] ) we obtain the following simplified equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the linear dissipation rate of these modes , and the factor of 3 appears for combinatorial reasons . rapidly oscillating terms as well as second time derivative of mode amplitudes were discarded in deriving these equations . at initial times when the amplitudes of modes @xmath18 and @xmath19 are infinitesimal",
    ", we can take the amplitude of mode @xmath16 to be fixed ( @xmath24 , and solve the above two equations for the growth rate ( @xmath25 ) of mode amplitudes , which is @xmath26.\\ ] ] the coupling coefficient @xmath27 is largest when the modes @xmath18 and @xmath19 have nearly the same radial order @xmath28 and spherical - harmonic degree @xmath29 , whence @xmath30 .",
    "we see that parametric instability sets in provided that @xmath31 ignoring the damping for now , we obtain a very simple criterion for parametric instability : @xmath32    the product @xmath33 is a dimensionless quantity which is a measure of the nonlinearity of the system .",
    "the coupling coefficients are calculated using equation ( [ eq : couplings ] ) of appendix a , which is a somewhat long expression . however",
    ", simple scaling argument shows that @xmath34 for a low order quadrupole mode coupled to two high order g - modes ( where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are stellar mass and radius ) , so that @xmath37 for a solar - mass main sequence star .",
    "this is in good agreement with detailed numerical calculations ( table 1 ) .",
    "if the energy @xmath38 in the f - mode is @xmath39 then parametric resonance is possible provided that we can find a triplet with @xmath40 less than @xmath41 of the frequency of the f - mode .",
    "we discuss below the possibility of finding such resonant triplets involving high degree g - modes .    to put this energy in perspective , note that the dimensionless radial amplitude of the f - mode is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "tidal capture is expected to result in motions @xmath44 , @xmath45 . for comparison , the most energetic five - minute oscillations of the sun have about @xmath46 , and the total energy in all solar modes is @xmath47 [ @xcite ] .",
    "it also follows from these scalings that @xmath48 .",
    "the dispersion relation for g - modes is [ e.g. @xcite ] @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is the mode period , @xmath53 is the brunt - visl  frequency , @xmath54 is the upper turning point of the mode , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are constants of order 0.5 and 6 respectively for @xmath58 main sequence star .",
    "note that mode frequency goes to zero as @xmath59 goes to infinity , and the frequency approaches @xmath60 as @xmath59 tends to zero .",
    "furthermore , it follows from equation ( [ eq : pnl ] ) that the frequencies of modes of large degree are function of @xmath59 , and that the frequency spacing between modes of adjacent @xmath28 for a fixed @xmath29 , @xmath61 , is approximately equal to @xmath62 . the total number of distinct frequencies @xmath63 for which both @xmath64 and @xmath65 are of order @xmath29 scales as @xmath66 .",
    "these frequencies are distributed between @xmath67 and @xmath53 . statistically therefore ,",
    "given a typical primary frequency @xmath68 , the lowest @xmath29 such that @xmath69 should be @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth noting that the frequency of the @xmath71 f - mode ( strongly excited during tidal capture ) is in fact less than @xmath72 in sun - like stars , so resonant g - modes will exist .",
    "the radiative damping time of long - wavelength g - modes is of the order of the photon diffusion time or thermal time @xmath73 , which for a solar type star is about @xmath74 years , and it decreases as @xmath75 with increasing mode degree .",
    "( the mode damping time for a completely radiative star decreases much more rapidly with @xmath29 since the outer turning point of g - modes moves outward with increasing degree .",
    "however , main sequence globular cluster stars have a convective envelope of thickness @xmath76 10% of the stellar radius , and for these stars the radius of the outer turning point of high - degree g - modes is independent of @xmath29 at fixed frequency , and the damping time scales as @xmath75 ) . thus the damping rate of a mode of degree @xmath29 ( and @xmath77 ) is @xmath78 parametric instability can exist only if there are modes that have both @xmath79 and @xmath80 less than @xmath81 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : growth ] ) ] .",
    "this dual condition places a lower limit to the value of @xmath33 at which parametric instability occurs , which we now calculate . by the arguments of the last paragraph , the minimum degree at which the resonance condition ( [ eq : resonance ] ) is met is @xmath82 the maximum degree is set by the requirement that mode damping",
    "be less than @xmath81 , which gives @xmath83 obviously @xmath84 in order that there exist g - modes resonantly coupled to the primary mode .",
    "this leads to the following condition on mode amplitude for parametric instability to operate : @xmath85 for a solar - type main sequence star , typically @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the f - mode must have energy @xmath89 in order to spawn a lower frequency mode via parametric instability .",
    "solar p and f modes lie at least seven orders of magnitude below this threshold ( see above ) .",
    "so far we have neglected stellar rotation .",
    "rotation lifts the degeneracy of mode frequencies with respect to the spherical - harmonic order @xmath90 : thus we have @xmath91 instead of @xmath92 .",
    "this enlarges the number of modes available for resonant non - linear interactions , including parametric instability . for a star rotating rigidly with angular velocity @xmath93 the frequency splitting for high degree g - modes in the rotating frame of the star , @xmath94 ,",
    "is approximately @xmath95 , whereas if the mean differential rotation in the radiative interior of the star is @xmath96 , then @xmath97 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "thus for a rigidly rotating star rotational splitting becomes important at mode degree @xmath29 such that @xmath98 , or @xmath99 for a star like the sun . for @xmath29",
    "greater than this value one can find modes with frequency within @xmath100 of some desired value , which is much better than what we get for a nonrotating star . note that even a very small differential rotation in radiative interior leads to a large value of @xmath101 .",
    "however , in the case of the sun , where the internal rotation is known from measurements of p - mode frequency splitting , the differential rotation in the radiative interior appears to be close to zero .",
    "nevertheless , in rotating stars one can find modes with smaller values of @xmath80 and so parametric instability persists down to smaller mode energies .",
    "the astrophysical importance of the parametric instability depends upon the amplitude at which nonlinearities intervene to stop exponential growth . in simple mechanical systems , it is common for parametric instabilities to saturate because the natural frequency of the daughter mode is a function of amplitude .",
    "although the same mechanism applies in principle to g modes , it does not affect the linear growth rate until the energy in a single daughter mode is comparable to that in the primary mode , as discussed in more detail in appendix c. other nonlinearities become important at much smaller amplitudes .    as the energy of the primary mode decreases to balance",
    "the increasing energy in all of its parametrically unstable daughters , equations ( [ eq : growth ] ) and ( [ eq : instrip ] ) remain true if we replace the initial amplitude ( @xmath102 ) with its current value ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "hence both the width of the unstable resonance and the peak growth rate decrease with @xmath14 .",
    "initially unstable daughters become stable .",
    "it can be shown that parametric resonance involving a single daughter mode , where @xmath103 , leads to periodic transfer of energy back and forth between the daughter and the primary .",
    "we now discuss the generalization of this result to the more realistic case where a large number of modes ( @xmath104 ) of angular frequency @xmath105 are coupled to the mode @xmath16 of frequency @xmath13 . at present , however , we ignore direct interactions among the daughters themselves , as well as parametric decay of the daughters into `` granddaughters . '' for clarity we write down the equations for modes @xmath16 and @xmath104 below : @xmath106    @xmath107    where @xmath108    it is straightforward to show from these equations that in the absence of damping the sum of the energy in all modes is conserved , i.e. @xmath109 furthermore , it can be shown that nonlinear interactions lead eventually to equipartition of energy among all the coupled modes .",
    "thus the steady state energy of modes is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the number of modes involved in parametric resonance with mode @xmath16 .",
    "initially , when all the energy is in mode @xmath16 , daughter modes grow exponentially , and the characteristic time for the energy in mode @xmath16 to halve is of order @xmath112 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : growth ] ) ] . we shall call this energy - halving timescale @xmath113 , since it derives from nonlinear mode couplings .    in more detail",
    ", @xmath113 depends logarithmically on the mean initial energy per daughter mode , @xmath114 .",
    "the latter energy has at least the thermal value @xmath115 , whence @xmath116 . since the g - modes may be stochastically excited by macroscopic processes such as semiconvection in the core or convection in the envelope of the star , it is probably more realistic to assume @xmath117 , or approximately @xmath118days .    in the simplified model of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : modela])-([eq : modelb ] ) , complete equipartition [ eq .  ( [ eq : equipart ] ) ] is obtained only on a timescale @xmath119 , because the nonlinear interaction rate decreases in proportion to the primary amplitude ; furthermore , phase coherence between the primary and the daughters tends to be lost .",
    "because of damping and because of coupling to granddaughter modes , equipartition may never be achieved in a real star .",
    "we have verified that our model behaves as described by numerically integrating the differential equations ( [ eq : modela])-([eq : modelb ] ) , and the results are shown in fig . 1",
    ".    we can compare the nonlinear timescale to the timescale for decay of the primary mode by linear radiative damping .",
    "the former is @xmath120 if the radiative damping time for the primary mode is @xmath121 , then parametric instability is the dominant damping process for the mode provided that @xmath122 the damping time for solar f and low order g modes is about @xmath11 years . by this comparison ,",
    "nonlinear damping would appear to be more rapid than linear damping if the energy of the primary is greater than @xmath123 , which is less than the minimum energy at which parametric instability can exist [ eq .",
    "[ eq : parains ] ) ] .",
    "so the nonlinear process should always dominate whenever it is allowed at all .",
    "but we shall revise this conclusion below .",
    "we now consider the long - term evolution of the system . after a period @xmath124",
    ", the energy in the primary mode drops by a factor @xmath125 and is shared among @xmath126 parametrically resonant daughter modes .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lmin])-([eq : lmax ] ) and the typical values of @xmath27 , @xmath73 , and @xmath13 cited above , we estimate @xmath3 . the time scale for further energy decline",
    "is set by the daughter modes , which both dissipate energy by radiative process and also spawn lower frequency modes .",
    "the radiative damping time for g - modes of @xmath127 is on order a week ; and in fact this time is @xmath128 for modes of @xmath129 .",
    "energy dissipated this way can clearly never return to global oscillations of the star .",
    "additionally , energy can also be removed from daughter modes if they themselves parametrically destabilize modes of still lower frequency``granddaughter modes '' .",
    "the parametric growth rate of a granddaughter mode ( @xmath23 ) due to nonlinearity in the daughter mode ( @xmath104 ) is @xmath130 .",
    "energy transfer to the granddaughters will significantly retard the growth of the daughter modes when @xmath131 , or in other words @xmath132 .",
    "now it follows from an analysis of the 3-mode couplings that @xmath133 if @xmath134 ( appendix a ) .",
    "hence secondary parametric instabilities become important when @xmath135 .",
    "most of the daughter modes have degree @xmath136 , and after a time @xmath124 each has a typical amplitude @xmath137 .",
    "this is smaller than @xmath138 if @xmath139 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lmin])-([eq : lmax ] ) we find @xmath140 .",
    "thus in the regime @xmath141erg , most of the daughter modes will be limited to energies much less than the equipartition value ( @xmath142 ) by secondary parametric instabilities .",
    "we can estimate how much this process should increase the nonlinear damping time of the primary mode .",
    "we assume that each daughter mode ( @xmath104 ) continues to absorb energy from the primary at a rate @xmath143 even after @xmath144 has saturated .",
    "if saturation occurs at @xmath145 , the primary loses energy at the rate @xmath146 instead of @xmath147 as for @xmath148 . the modified nonlinear damping rate implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : netdamp ] ) scales as @xmath149 instead of @xmath150 . comparing this modified damping rate to the linear radiative damping of the primary mode ( @xmath151 )",
    ", we find that nonlinear damping continues to dominate provided @xmath152 , which is only an order of magnitude above the threshold for parametric instability (  2.1 ) .    at the energies expected of tidal capture ( @xmath153 ) , the average energy per daughter mode is so small , because their number @xmath154 is so large , that the growth rate of the granddaughter modes can be neglected for the most part . however , secondary instabilities will prevent the fastest - growing daughters  those near the center of the instability strip ( [ eq : instrip])from exceeding an amplitude @xmath155 .",
    "by contrast , in the simplified model of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : modela])-([eq : modelb ] ) where secondary instabilities are ignored , the single fastest - growing mode briefly attains almost the entire energy of the system .",
    "low order g - modes of a radiative star carry a substantial amount of energy as a result of tidal interaction .",
    "the parametric instability described above will operate on these modes just as well , and independently of the f - modes , causing a loss of their energy on a time scale similar to the f - mode .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in  4 .",
    "the parametric nonlinear interaction mechanism described in the last section does not apply to fully convective stars , which do not have stable g - modes .",
    "however , even for these stars nonlinear mode coupling can be an important dissipation mechanism for the f - mode energy .",
    "the energy in f - modes of a convective star after tidal capture is often an order of magnitude larger compared to a radiative star of same mass and orbital parameters , and thus the nonlinear parameter , @xmath156 , is larger for convective stars . in this case",
    "even the normally very inefficient process of nonlinear coupling of a f - mode to higher frequency p - modes can transfer energy to short wavelength waves where it is dissipated on a relatively short time scale .",
    "the nonlinear response to the f - mode can be treated as a forced excitation of all p - modes of degree @xmath157 0 , 2 , and 4 , in which the forcing function is quadratic in the f - mode amplitude and oscillates at twice the f - mode frequency .",
    "we calculate this response by solving an inhomogenous wave equation for the sum of the p - mode amplitudes with the nonlinear forcing function as the inhomogenous term .",
    "the latter can be obtained either from the lagrangian given in appendix a , or by expanding mass , momentum and energy equations to second order in wave quantities [ e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "the solution of the inhomogeneous equation is shown in figure 2 together with the f - mode eigenfunction .",
    "the turbulent viscous , and thermal , dissipation of wave energy is calculated using this wavefunction .",
    "note the generation of significant power at short wavelengths and the relatively large displacement amplitude and its derivative in the outer part of the star ; these effects enhance the dissipation of f - mode energy .",
    "the resulting nonlinear dissipation time for the f - mode by coupling to p - modes is @xmath158 where @xmath159 is f - mode energy in units of @xmath160 .",
    "we can estimate the damping rate in another way that is less accurate but provides some insight . in the present special case of the general 3-mode interaction ( [ eq : gen ] ) , we drop all nonlinear terms except the square of the f - mode amplitude .",
    "the result is @xmath161 where @xmath14 is the amplitude of the f - mode which we take to be @xmath162 .",
    "substituting this into the above equation we find for the amplitude of mode @xmath104 , @xmath163 the net displacement associated with the p - mode amplitudes @xmath164 is @xmath165 which can be used to calculate the dampings .",
    "the function @xmath166 has alternating signs for even and odd order modes near the surface of the star where most of the damping is taking place .",
    "this can lead to significant cancellation in the total displacement .",
    "nevertheless we proceed by assuming that different modes can be added in quadrature .",
    "the energy in mode @xmath104 is @xmath167.\\ ] ] if the rate of dissipation of energy of a mode @xmath104 driven at frequency @xmath168 is @xmath169 , then the rate of energy dissipation of the f - mode ( mode @xmath16 ) can be calculated from this last equation , and the resulting dissipation time is @xmath170 the 3-mode coupling coefficients , @xmath171 , involving a quadrupole f and a radial p mode for a solar model , have a typical value @xmath172 , and the damping time for high order p - modes ( 1/@xmath173 ) is about 10 days .",
    "since there are about 100 p - modes of degree 0 , 2 , and 4 coupled to the quadrupole f - mode , we see from equation ( [ eq : tffpincoh ] ) that for a f - mode of energy @xmath39 , the non - linear damping time is about @xmath11 days which is within a factor of a few of the numerically calculated value given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tffp ] ) . for comparison",
    "we note that the linear turbulent viscous damping time of f - mode is about @xmath11 years .",
    "the energy in the f - mode of a 0.5 solar mass polytropic star of index 1.5 , tidally captured by a one solar mass star , is about @xmath174 erg ( @xmath175 ) , and so its nonlinear dissipation [ [ eq : tffp ] ) ] time is about 30 days . at such high energies ,",
    "however , the system is very nonlinear : that is , four mode couplings are as important as the three mode couplings .",
    "figure 2 shows that for this energy the amplitude of the p - mode response is about the same ( or greater ) as the f - mode amplitude throughout the star , and thus higher order couplings must be equally important . in this case",
    "it is very likely that high order p - modes are resonantly excited leading to even more efficient dissipation to f - mode energy .",
    "moreover , since most of the energy is dissipated in the outermost envelope of the star at a rate of @xmath176 , which is more than can be transported by convection , it will cause the envelope to expand away from the star .",
    "this is a further indication of the breakdown of the weak nonlinear calculation presented here .",
    "in addition to the nonlinear effect arising from the third order fluid lagrangian , considered here , there is also nonlinearity associated with the thermal dissipation process itself .",
    "it can be shown that both of these are of the same order , and thus a neglect of the latter does not change our result by more than a factor of a few , which is within the uncertainty of the calculation of this section .",
    "main sequence stars of mass greater than 0.5 @xmath177 have a sizable radiative core ( see table 2 ) that supports a dense family of g - modes . when such stars are tidally captured , resulting in a highly eccentric orbit with separation between the stars at periastron of only a few stellar radii initially , their quadrupole f and low order g modes are excited to large amplitudes .",
    "the linear radiative damping time for these modes is of order @xmath11 years .",
    "however these modes are resonantly coupled to high degree g - modes by parametric instability which provides a very efficient way of dissipating their energy ( see  2 ) .",
    "we now estimate the time for the energy of the low order modes to decay due to nonlinear interaction using the results of  2 .    the main ingradient required for nonlinear dissipation calculation is the 3-mode coupling coefficients , @xmath27 , which are computed using equation ( [ eq : couplings ] ) .",
    "the numerical calculation of @xmath27 is carried out for a simplified polytropic stellar model , which is widely used in tidal capture and evolution calculations , as well as a standard solar model .",
    "the main sequence globular cluster stars of mass greater than about 0.5 @xmath177 have a radiative core ( see table 2 ) and can be crudely modelled as a polytrope of index 3 [ cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the coupling coefficients involving low degree g - modes ( @xmath178 ) are calculated using eigenfunctions obtained by solving the wave equation , whereas for high degree g - modes we use the wkb solution which is an excellent approximation .",
    "we find that @xmath179 for the sun and 1.0 @xmath177 polytropic star of index 3 agree to within a factor of two for @xmath180 ( the polytropic model yields a higher value ) .",
    "however , coupling coefficients increase with @xmath181 for polytropic models but not in the case of the sun or a realistic stellar model . this is because g - modes are trapped in the radiative interior of low mass main sequence stars , whereas in a polytropic model , where the brunt - visl  frequency increases monotonically with distance from the center , g - modes propagate closer and closer to the surface with increasing mode degree .",
    "one should therefore use a realistic stellar model for the purpose of nonlinear mode interaction calculation .",
    "since @xmath182 depends only weakly on stellar mass we use a solar model to compute coupling coefficients that are used for lower mass globular cluster stars ; the true coupling coefficients are larger by about 20% .",
    "table 1 shows the value of @xmath183 for a selected number of modes .",
    "note that a typical value of coupling coefficient is @xmath184 erg@xmath185 which is in good agreement with the rough estimate of @xmath186 .    the dependence of @xmath179 on @xmath187 is entirely contained in wigner 3-j symbol [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tripll ] ) ] , which for large @xmath181 scales as @xmath188 . thus a good fraction of modes of all possible @xmath90 , for a given @xmath29 , are equally well coupled to the f and low order g modes .",
    "finally , we note that the coupling coefficient decreases with increasing @xmath189 and is neglegible if @xmath190 .",
    "the energy input rate per orbital period , for several different modes , are shown in figure 3 as a function of distance between the stars at periastron .",
    "this was calculated using a scheme similar to @xcite . in general",
    "most of the energy is in some g - mode which has a period close to the periastron passage time . substituting mode amplitudes and coupling coefficients into equation ( [ eq : tnl ] ) we obtain nonlinear damping times which are displayed in figure 4 for several modes as a function of periastron separation .",
    "note that for mode energy of @xmath191 erg ( corresponding to dimensionless surface displacement amplitude @xmath192 2x@xmath193 ; see table 1 ) the nonlinear damping time is 50 days . during this time",
    "the mode energy decreases by a large factor , which is shared equally by about @xmath194 high degree g - modes that have been parametrically excited via nonlinear mode coupling .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ eq : tnl ] ) that the nonlinear damping time scales as @xmath195 , and thus for mode energy of @xmath196 erg the damping time is only 5 days . for comparison we note that the radiative damping time for low order quadrupole modes are of order @xmath11 years .",
    "thus nonlinear dissipation dominates even when periastron distance is @xmath197 ( see fig . 3 & 4 ) .",
    "in fact the nonlinear dissipation rate is larger than the linear radiative damping so long as mode energy is greater than about @xmath198 erg .",
    "it should be emphasized that energy removed from a mode by nonlinear interactions is distributed over a large number of g - modes .",
    "the energy is eventually thermalized on the dissipation time scale of high degree g - modes , which for modes of @xmath129 is of the same order as @xmath113 .",
    "how the star adjusts to the energy deposited in its core on a short time scale is outside of the scope of this work .",
    "however , we note that even @xmath196 erg of energy deposited in the radiative core is a small fraction of its thermal energy content , and thus will have a minor effect on the structure of the star .",
    "main sequence globular cluster stars of mass less than about 0.5 @xmath199 are almost fully convective , and therefore the coupling of f - mode to g - modes is very weak . the dominant nonlinear coupling of the f - mode in this case , as described in  3 , is with p - modes .",
    "physically this nonresonant mode coupling results in power on smaller length scale , and also the value of the gradient of the wave function generated can be considerably larger than the original f - mode wave function in the outer part of the star ( see fig .",
    "this leads to more efficient dissipation of wave energy . as discussed in",
    " 3 the f - mode dissipation time due to this process is about 3x@xmath11 e@xmath200 days .    *",
    "5 . summary *    tidally excited modes of a main sequence star in a highly eccentric orbit , with periastron distance of 4 stellar radii or less , have energy about @xmath191 erg or greater , or fractional change in stellar radius of 0.2% or more .",
    "the linear radiative and turbulent dissipation times for these modes are about @xmath11 years .",
    "we have calculated the time needed for energy of tidally excited modes to decrease due to nonlinear interaction with other modes in the star for two different cases that are described below .",
    "one of the cases considered is that of a star with a radiative core  for instance main sequence globular cluster stars of mass greater than about 0.5 m@xmath201 .",
    "the most important mode coupling in these radiative stars involves high degree g - modes which are parametrically excited by the low order quadrupole modes .",
    "the time scale for energy transfer for this process is @xmath202 , where @xmath203erg@xmath185 is 3-mode coupling coefficient .",
    "thus for @xmath204erg , or @xmath192 2x@xmath193 , the nonlinear damping time is 50 days .",
    "this is smaller by a factor of @xmath205 compared to the nonlinear damping time estimated by kochanek ( 1992 ) , who had not considered parametric coupling .",
    "the energy removed from the primary mode initially resides in roughly @xmath206 high degree g - modes and is later dissipated in the radiative core of the star on a time scale of about a year . since this energy is small compared to the thermal energy content of the core , it is unlikely to have much effect on the structure of the star in one orbital passage .",
    "the other case we have considered is that of a fully convective star , such as a main sequence star of mass less than about 0.5 m@xmath201 .",
    "most of the tidal energy in these stars , which do not have stable g - modes , resides in quadrupole f - modes .",
    "the f - modes couple to high order p - modes of degrees @xmath1570 , 2 , and 4 generating short wavelength waves that significantly enhance the energy dissipation rate .",
    "the energy of short wavelength p - modes is dissipated near the stellar surface by turbulent and radiative viscosity .",
    "the nonlinear energy dissipation time of f - modes is estimated to be @xmath207 ( @xmath160 /@xmath208 ) days or @xmath209 @xmath210 days , which is shorter than the linear dissipation time when the mode energy is greater than about @xmath211 erg . and",
    "it is also smaller than the nonlinear damping time estimate of kochanek ( 1992 ) by a factor of about @xmath212 . for mode energy of @xmath174 erg ,",
    "that which is expected in tidal captures , the nonlinear damping time is about 30 days .",
    "however , for such a large energy , 4-mode 5-mode , and higher - order mode coupling are also important ; that is , the weak nonlinear approximation is not valid .",

    "to avoid confusion , we raise and lower indices using @xmath270 only : for example , @xmath271 ( not @xmath272 ) .    using these rules",
    "we integrate the third order lagrangian over angle which leads to the following expression      every term in this expression is formally of order @xmath274 , where @xmath275 or @xmath276 , since @xmath277 .",

    "when all three interacting modes have wavelengths @xmath280 , then the first term on the righthand side of ( [ eq : lagxi ] ) dominates the rest by a factor @xmath281 .",
    "this justifies our statement in the text that the coefficient @xmath282 coupling daughter to granddaughter modes exceeds the coupling @xmath179 of the primary mode to its daughters by a factor @xmath283 .",
    "physically this can be understood , or at least remembered , by noting that the parametric growth rate scales as the shear @xmath284 in the parent mode .",

    "substituting these into equation ( [ eq : cnleq ] ) we find that for a rigidly rotating star @xmath290 and so the frequency difference between modes of @xmath291 and @xmath292 is @xmath95 . for a differentially rotating star",

    "if this formula predicts @xmath296 , the brunt - visl  frequency , then individual g - modes are trapped within regions smaller than the entire radiative zone , and the spectrum of mode frequencies becomes continuous .",
    "mechanical oscillations and waves are generally anharmonic : their natural frequency depends upon amplitude . unless other processes intervene earlier , a parametric instability will saturate at an amplitude such that the resonance condition ( [ eq : instrip ] ) is no longer satisfied because of the anharmonic frequency shift .",

    "that is , we may normally take @xmath309 .",
    "this is because the eulerian dynamical equations contain the advective derivative @xmath310 , and for small perturbations of a static equilibrium , the ratio of the second ( nonlinear ) part of this operator to the first is @xmath311 . a single g mode",
    ", however , is an exception to this general rule if the wavelength is small compared to a pressure or density scale height , @xmath312 .",
    "such a wave is nearly incompressible , so that if @xmath313 in a local plane - wave approximation , then @xmath314 is @xmath315 instead of @xmath316 .",

    "one can check that other nonlinear terms vanish to leading order in @xmath319 .",
    "for example , the dynamical equation for the vorticity @xmath320 contains the source term @xmath321 ; but for a single wave , the gradients of the density and pressure perturbations are both approximately parallel to the wavenumber , so that @xmath322 vanishes to leading order in @xmath319 .",
    "we note in passing that nonlinear interactions involving two or more nonparallel wavenumbers need not be similarly suppressed . in parametric instability , for example , the primary and daughter modes have nonparallel wavenumbers .",
    "anharmonicity is a special nonlinearity because it involves self - interaction of a single mode .",
    "consequently , the anharmonic frequency shift of a wkb g mode is @xmath323 notice that this does not depend on mode wavelength .",
    "equating this shift to the width @xmath324 of the parametric resonance caused by a fundamental mode of dimensionless amplitude @xmath325 , one predicts saturation when the small - scale mode has amplitude @xmath326 . in the radiative core , however , @xmath327 , so the small - scale mode would have more energy than the large - scale one by a factor of order @xmath328 .    clearly , other nonlinear processes must intervene to halt the growth of the small - scale mode before frequency shifts become important .",
    "in the situation contemplated here , we foresee only two such processes : one is the decrease in the parametric growth rate as the energy in the primary mode declines ; and the other is the destabilization of granddaughter modes .",
