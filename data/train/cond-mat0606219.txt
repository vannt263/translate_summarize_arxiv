    "it is well - known that a description of magnetic anisotropy , k , can be provided once relativistic effects such as the spin - orbit coupling on the electronic structure of materials are considered . over recent years",
    "` first - principles ' theoretical work , based on relativistic density functional theory , has been quite successful in describing trends in k for a range of magnetic materials in bulk , film and nanostructured form  @xcite , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these results can be fed into micromagnetic models of the magnetic properties to describe phenomena such as magnetisation reversal processes in magnetic recording materials  @xcite .",
    "there are also implications for electronic transport effects such as anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr )  @xcite . until only very recently ,",
    "however , the temperature dependence of k was assumed to follow that given by single ion anisotropy models developed by callen and callen and others over 40 years ago  @xcite this assumption has now been challenged by ab - initio electronic structure theory  @xcite .",
    "the unexpected dependence of the magnetic anisotropy of @xmath3-fept , found in experiment  @xcite , to decrease in proportion with the square of the magnetisation , @xmath10 , is described well by the new theoretical treatments whereas the single ion magnetic anisotropy models fail .",
    "evidently the itinerant nature of the electrons in metallic magnets like @xmath11 is an important factor .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed description of our ab - initio theory for the temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "it involves a fully relativistic description of the electronic structure and hence includes spin - orbit coupling effects .",
    "the thermally excited magnetic fluctuations are accounted for with the , by now , well - tried , disordered local moment ( dlm ) picture .",
    "@xcite    the study of temperature - dependent magnetic anisotropy has recently become particularly topical owing to extensive experimental studies of magnetic films and nanostructures and their technological potential .",
    "for example , fabrication of assemblies of increasingly smaller magnetic nanoparticles has great potential in the design of ultra - high density magnetic data storage media .",
    "@xcite if thermally driven demagnetisation and loss of data is to be avoided over a reasonable storage period , there is , however , a particle size limit to confront .",
    "a way of reducing this limit is to use materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy , @xmath0 , since the superparamagnetic diameter of a magnetic particle is proportional to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the thermal energy .",
    "@xcite writing to media of very high @xmath0 material can be achieved by temporary heating .",
    "@xcite @xmath0 is reduced significantly during the magnetic write process and the information is locked in as the material cools .",
    "modelling this process and improving the design of high density magnetic recording media therefore requires an understanding of how @xmath0 varies with temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy in magnets where the magnetic moments are well - localised , e.g. rare - earth and oxide magnets , is described rather well by these single ion anisotropy models but it is questionable whether this will also be the case for itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "@xcite owing to its high uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( mca ) ( 4 - 10 10@xmath14 ergs/@xmath15 or up to 1.76 mev per @xmath11 pair  @xcite ) the chemically ordered @xmath3 phase of equiatomic @xmath11 , has attracted much attention as a potential ultra - high magnetic recording density material .",
    "indeed arrays of @xmath11 nanoparticles with diameters as small as 3 nm have been synthesised .",
    "@xcite for a uniaxial magnet like this , @xmath0 is the difference between the free energies , @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the system magnetised along @xmath18 and @xmath19 crystallographic directions .",
    "so for the first application of our theory we chose @xmath3-ordered @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite careful experimental studies of its fundamental magnetic properties .",
    "@xcite find that over a large temperature range , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 as expected from the simple single ion anisotropy model .",
    "we found our ab - initio calculations to be in good agreement with this surprising result .",
    "mryasov et al .",
    "@xcite independently examined the same issues with a different theoretical but complementary approach and drew the same conclusions . in this paper , after providing full details of the r - dlm theory of magnetic anisotropy , we explore whether this @xmath23 behavior is a general property of the mca of @xmath3-ordered itinerant transition metal uniaxial magnets by investigating another important uniaxial magnetic material @xmath24 .",
    "we also study the temperature dependence of a material which has cubic rather than the tetragonal crystal symmetry of @xmath3-ordered alloys , and which is magnetically softer , namely compositionally disordered @xmath11 .    in the next section",
    "we describe the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy that emerges from classical spin models with single site anisotropy .",
    "we then review briefly current approaches to calculating @xmath0 from first - principles electronic theory of materials at @xmath25k .",
    "an outline of the ` disordered local moment ' ( dlm ) picture of metallic magnetism at finite temperature precedes a description of its relativistic generalisation .",
    "it is shown how the temperature dependence of the magnetisation , @xmath10 , can be found .",
    "the key outcome from the r - dlm theory is the formalism for the magnetisation dependence of magnetic anisotropy ab - initio .",
    "applications to uniaxial @xmath3-fepd and cubic @xmath5 follow and the final section provides a summary .",
    "the mca of a material can be conveniently expressed as @xmath26 where the @xmath27 s are coefficients , @xmath28 is the magnetisation direction and @xmath29 s are polynomials ( spherical harmonics ) of the angles @xmath30 , @xmath31 , fixing the orientation of @xmath28 with respect to the crystal axes , and belong to the fully symmetric representation of the crystal point group .",
    "as the temperature rises , @xmath0 decreases rapidly .",
    "the key features of the results of the early theoretical work on this effect  @xcite are revealed by classical spin models pertinent to magnets with localised magnetic moments .",
    "the anisotropic behavior of a set of localised ` spins ' associated with ions sitting on crystalline sites , @xmath32 , in the material , is given by a term in the hamiltonian @xmath33 with @xmath34 a unit vector denoting the spin direction on the site @xmath32 .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the ` spins ' sample the energy surface over a small angular range about the magnetisation direction and the anisotropy energy is given from the difference between averages taken for the magnetisation along the easy and hard directions .",
    "if the coefficients @xmath35 are assumed to be rather insensitive to temperature , the dominant thermal variation of @xmath0 for a ferromagnet is given by @xmath36 the averages @xmath37 are taken such that @xmath38 , the magnetisation of the system at temperature @xmath1 , and @xmath39 is the order of the spherical harmonic describing the angular dependence of the local anisotropy i.e. @xmath40 and @xmath41 for uniaxial and cubic systems respectively . at low temperatures @xmath42 and near the curie temperature @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "these results can be illustrated straightforwardly in a way which will be helpful for the development of our ab - initio theory .",
    "consider a classical spin hamiltonian appropriate to a uniaxial ferromagnet .",
    "@xmath45 where @xmath34 describes the orientation of a classical spin at site @xmath32 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are exchange and anisotropy parameters .",
    "@xmath48 is a unit vector along the magnetic easy axis .",
    "a mean field description of the system is given by reference to a hamiltonian @xmath49 where the orientation of weiss field @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 , determines the direction of the magnetisation of the system and has direction cosines ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) .",
    "within this mean field approximation the magnetisation @xmath2 is @xmath55 where the probability of a spin being orientated along @xmath56 is @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "the free energy difference per site between the system magnetised along two directions @xmath59 and @xmath60 is @xmath61 if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis @xmath48 respectively then @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the legendre polynomial @xmath64 . as a function of the magnetisation @xmath65 , @xmath66 varies quadratically near the curie temperature @xmath43 and cubically at low @xmath1 .",
    "the same dependence can be shown for this simple spin model for the rate of variation of magnetic anisotropy with angle @xmath30 that the magnetisation makes with the system s easy axis , namely the magnetic torque  @xcite @xmath67 .",
    "magnetocrystalline anisotropy is caused largely by spin - orbit coupling and receives an ab - initio description from the relativistic generalisation of spin density functional ( sdf ) theory .",
    "@xcite apart from the work by mryasov et al .",
    "@xcite and ourselves  @xcite , up to now calculations of the anisotropy constants @xmath0 have been suited to @xmath25k only .",
    "spin - orbit coupling effects are treated perturbatively or with a fully relativistic theory  @xcite .",
    "typically the total energy , or the single - electron contribution to it ( if the force theorem is used ) , is calculated for two or more magnetisation directions , @xmath68 and @xmath69 separately and then the mca is obtained from the difference , @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath70 is typically small ranging from mev to @xmath7ev and high precision in calculating the energies is required .",
    "for example , we have used this rationale with a fully relativistic theory to study the mca of magnetically soft , compositionally disordered binary and ternary component alloys  @xcite and the effect upon it of short - range  @xcite and long range chemical order  @xcite in harder magnets such as @xmath71 and @xmath11 .",
    "experimentally , measurements of magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants of magnets can be obtained from torque magnetometry  @xcite . from similar considerations of magnetic torque",
    ", ab - initio calculations of mca can be made .",
    "there are obvious advantages in that the mca can be obtained from a single calculation and reliance is not placed on the accurate extraction of a small difference between two energies .",
    "in particular the torque method has been used to good effect by freeman and co - workers  @xcite in conjunction with their state - tracking method to study the mca of a range of uniaxial magnets including layered systems .",
    "if the free energy of a material magnetised along a direction specified by @xmath72 ( @xmath52 , @xmath73 , @xmath54 ) is @xmath74 , then the torque is @xmath75 the contribution to the torque from the anisotropic part of @xmath74 leads to a direct link between the gap in the spin wave spectrum and the mca by the solution of the equation  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the gyromagnetic ratio . closely related to @xmath78 is the variation of @xmath74 with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath79 and @xmath80 . as shown by wang et al .",
    "@xcite , for most uniaxial magnets , which are well approximated by a free energy of the form @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 and @xmath83 and magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants and @xmath84 is the isotropic part of the free energy ) , @xmath85 .",
    "this is equal to the mca , @xmath86 . for a magnet with cubic symmetry so that @xmath87 a calculation of @xmath88 gives @xmath89 . in this work we present our formalism for the direct calculation of the torque quantities @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and hence the mca , in which the effects of thermally induced magnetic fluctuations are included so that the temperature dependence is captured .    in our formalism",
    "the motion of the electron is described with spin - polarised , relativistic multiple scattering theory .",
    "an adaptive mesh algorithm  @xcite for brillouin zone integrations is used in the calculations to ensure adequate numerical precision for the mca to within 0.1  @xmath7ev  @xcite .",
    "since we characterise the thermally induced magnetic fluctuations in terms of disordered local moments , we now go on to describe this picture of finite temperature magnetism .",
    "in a metallic ferromagnet at @xmath25k the electronic band structure is spin - polarised . with increasing temperature ,",
    "spin fluctuations are induced which eventually destroy the long - range magnetic order and hence the overall spin polarization of the system s electronic structure .",
    "these collective electron modes interact as the temperature is raised and are dependent upon and affect the underlying electronic structure",
    ". for many materials the magnetic excitations can be modelled by associating local spin - polarisation axes with all lattice sites and the orientations @xmath92 vary very slowly on the time - scale of the electronic motions .",
    "@xcite these ` local moment ' degrees of freedom produce local magnetic fields on the lattice sites which affect the electronic motions and are self - consistently maintained by them . by taking appropriate ensemble averages over the orientational configurations ,",
    "the system s magnetic properties can be determined .",
    "this ` disordered local moment ' ( dlm ) picture has been implemented within a multiple - scattering ( korringa - kohn - rostoker , kkr )  @xcite formalism using the first - principles approach to the problem of itinerant electron magnetism . at no stage",
    "does it map the many - electron problem onto an effective heisenberg model , and yet it deals , quantitatively , with both the ground state and the demise of magnetic long - range order at the curie temperature in a material - specific , parameter - free manner .",
    "it has been used to describe the experimentally observed local exchange splitting and magnetic short - range order in both ultra - thin fe films  @xcite and bulk fe , the damped rkky - like magnetic interactions in the compositionally disordered cumn spin - glass alloys  @xcite and the quantitative description of the onset of magnetic order in a range of alloys  @xcite . in combination with the local self - interaction correction ( l - sic )  @xcite for strong electron correlation effects",
    ", it also gives a revealing account of magnetic ordering in rare earths  @xcite .",
    "other applications of the dlm picture include dilute magnetic semiconductors  @xcite and actinides  @xcite .",
    "short - range order of the local moments can be explicitly included by making use of the recently developed kkr- nonlocal - cpa ( kkr - nlcpa )  @xcite .",
    "we now briefly recap on how this ` disordered local moment ' ( dlm ) picture is implemented using the kkr - cpa and how a ferromagnetic metal both above and below the curie temperature can be described .",
    "our main objective in this paper is to explain its relativistic extension and show how this leads to an ab - initio theory of the temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy when relativistic effects are explicitly included .",
    "the non - relativistic version of the dlm theory has been discussed in detail by gyorffy et al .",
    "@xcite here we summarise the general framework and concentrate on those aspects which are necessary for a description of magnetic anisotropy . the starting point is the specification of @xmath93 , the ` generalised ' electronic grand potential taken from the relativistic extension of spin density functional theory ( sdft )  @xcite .",
    "it specifies an itinerant electron system constrained such that the local spin polarisation axes are configured according to @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of sites ( moments ) in the system . for magnetic anisotropy to be described , relativistic effects such as spin - orbit coupling upon the motion of the electrons must be included .",
    "this means that orientations of the local moments with respect to a specified direction @xmath28 within the material are relevant .",
    "the role of a ( classical ) local moment hamiltonian , albeit a highly complicated one , is played by @xmath96 .",

    "@xcite over the past 20 years , the paramagnetic state , onset of magnetic order and transition temperatures of many systems have been successfully described .",
    "all applications to date , apart from our earlier study of @xmath11  @xcite and the cases described in this paper , have , however , neglected relativistic effects and have been devoted to the paramagnetic state where the symmetry turns the calculation into a binary alloy - type one with half the moments oriented along a direction and the rest antiparallel . once relativistic effects are included and/or the ferromagnetic state is considered , this simplicity is lost and , as is shown above , the continuous probability distribution , @xmath244 ,",
    "must be sampled for a fine mesh of angles and the averages with the probability distribution performed numerically .",
    "( careful checks have to be made to ensure that the sampling of @xmath244 is sufficient - in our calculations up to 40,000 values are used . ) of course , in the paramagnetic state @xmath245 so that a local moment on a site has an equal probability in pointing in any direction @xmath34 .",
    "the local moments change their orientations , @xmath246 , on a time scale @xmath247 long in comparison with the time taken for electrons to ` hop ' from site to site .",
    "meanwhile their magnitudes fluctuate rapidly on this fast electronic time scale which means that over times @xmath247 , the magnetisation on a site is equal to @xmath248 . as a consequence of the itinerant nature of the electrons ,",
    "the magnitude @xmath249 depends on the orientations of the local moments on surrounding sites , i.e. @xmath250 . in the dlm theory described above , @xmath251 , so that the size of the local moment on a site is taken from electronic charge density spin - polarised along @xmath116 and integrated over the site .",
    "an average is taken over the orientations @xmath252 on surrounding sites and the local charge and magnetisation densities are calculated self - consistently from a generalised sdft formalism and scf - kkr - cpa techniques .",
    "being a local mean field theory , the principal failure of the dlm to date is that it does not give an adequate description of local moment formation in ni rich systems because it can not allow for the effects of correlations among the orientations of the local moments over small neighbourhoods of atomic sites .",
    "( in principle this shortcoming is now addressable using the newly developed scf - kkr - nlcpa method  @xcite . ) in this paper however we will focus entirely on ` good ' local moment systems where the sizes of the moments are rather insensitive to their orientational environments . in these cases , for example , the self - consistently determined local moments of the paramagnetic dlm state differ little from the magnetisation per site obtained for the ferromagnetic state .",
    "for example in paramagnetic dlm @xmath3-fepd , a local moment of 2.98 @xmath253 is set up on each @xmath254 site whilst no moment forms on the @xmath255 sites .",
    "for the same lattice spacings ( @xmath2560.381 nm , @xmath2571 - note we have neglected the deviation of @xmath258 from ideal found experimentally ) we find that , for the completely ferromagnetically ordered state of @xmath24 at @xmath25k , the magnetisation per @xmath254 site is 2.96@xmath253 and a small magnetisation of 0.32@xmath253 is associated with the @xmath255 sites . likewise ,",

    "<S> we present a first - principles theory of the variation of magnetic anisotropy , @xmath0 , with temperature , @xmath1 , in metallic ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on relativistic electronic structure theory and calculation of magnetic torque . </S>",
    "<S> thermally induced ` local moment ' magnetic fluctuations are described within the relativistic generalisation of the ` disordered local moment ' ( r - dlm ) theory from which the @xmath1 dependence of the magnetisation , @xmath2 , is found . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the theory to a uniaxial magnetic material with _ tetragonal _ </S>",
    "<S> crystal symmetry,@xmath3-ordered fepd , and find its uniaxial @xmath0 consistent with a magnetic easy axis perpendicular to the fe / pd layers for all @xmath2 and proportional to @xmath4 for a broad range of values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same trend that we have previously found in @xmath3-ordered fept and which agrees with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this account , however , differs qualitatively from that extracted from a single ion anisotropy model . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the magnetically soft _ cubic _ magnet , the @xmath5 solid solution , and find that its small magnetic anisotropy constant @xmath6 rapidly diminishes from 8 @xmath7ev to zero . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 evolves from being proportional to @xmath8 at low @xmath1 to @xmath9 near the curie temperature . </S>"
