    "when designing a monte carlo simulation , the computational scientist often must decide which of several algorithmic options is the most efficient or how to optimize a particular algorithm . besides experience , few rules of guidance exist .    for detailed balance algorithms , the class we assume , likely the most rigorous rule is based on the work of peskun @xcite .",
    "he showed analytically that if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two transition matrices that satisfy detailed balance and asymptote to the same limiting distribution , then for jumps from state @xmath6 to state @xmath7 , algorithm 1 is more efficient than algorithm 2 if @xmath8 while he used this relation to establish the greater efficiency of the metropolis - hastings algorithm over several other generalized metropolis algorithms , establishing this relation on a case by case basis is generally difficult for large phase spaces .    the theory of markov chains says the magnitude of the transition matrix s subdominant eigenvalue @xmath0 controls the rate at which the sampling relaxes to a stationary condition .",
    "@xcite call this eigenvalue the asymptotic convergence parameter @xcite .",
    "because its magnitude must be less than one , its closeness to zero indicates a high degree of efficiency , and closeness to 1 , poor efficiency .",
    "statisticians in particular @xcite have derived a number of upper and lower bonds for this eigenvalue .",
    "again , making use of this rigorous information is sometimes difficult .",
    "oral tradition says that efficient sampling occurs when the acceptance ratio is around 50% .",
    "the acceptance ratio is the number of jumps to a different state divided by the total number of jumps attempted . in some sense tradition",
    "is consistent with peskun . because the transition matrix satisfies @xmath9",
    ", moving transition probability off of the diagonal generally increases the acceptance .",
    "however , the more relevant implication of peskun s result is the need for jumps among areas distantly separated in phase space .",
    "acceptance ratios are particularly misleading in cases where phase space separates into several relatively localized regions of large boltzmann weight separated by an energy activation barrier larger than thermal fluctuations . in this circumstance ,",
    "sampling is quasi - non - ergodically confined to one region , and within this region the acceptance ratio may be , or may have been adjusted to be , the canonical 50% .",
    "a direct approach to assessing the second eigenvalue is computing it numerically .",
    "the size of the transition matrix ( or in many cases the transition operator ) restricts a direct deterministic approach to small systems because of the amount of computer memory required .",
    "recently , doll _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the deterministic approach on the metropolis algorithm s transition matrix for single quadradtic , quartic , double well , and triple well oscillator potential energies .",
    "they discretized the one - dimensional phase space and prohibited very large displacements to create a finite matrix representation of the asymmetric transition matrix .",
    "they then used standard eigensystem software to compute the subdominant eigenvalue as a function of temperature and the metropolis box size .",
    "the metropolis box size is the maximum size of the proposed move from the current position in phase space .",
    "doll _ et al .",
    "_ found several interesting results .",
    "the results for the quadratic and quartic wells were similar : adjusting the box size so the acceptance rate is around 50% resulted in the second eigenvalue being reasonably removed from unity .",
    "for the double and triple wells , the competition between intra- and inter - well sampling made box size optimization more difficult . in some cases an acceptance rate around 50% corresponded to an unfavorable second eigenvalue .",
    "most interestingly , apparent activation energies in the behavior of the second eigenvalue existed and depended on the box size .",
    "further , as a function of box size , they found structure in the second eigenvalue reflecting the expected phase space structure .",
    "the acceptance ratio however featured little of the informative structure seen in the second eigenvalue .",
    "in short , the sampling dynamics , in particular the length scale dependence of the apparent activation energies , contained information about the underlying structure of the potential energy surface about the width of the barrier region , for example .    extending this type of deterministic analysis to higher dimensional phase spaces , however ,",
    "is rapidly checked by inadequate computer memory .",
    "accordingly , we are proposing a shift to a new monte carlo method to make this extension possible .",
    "we will illustrate the usefulness of this new method by comparing the second eigenvalue for several monte carlo algorithms applied to the one and two - dimensional ising models and for the metropolis algorithm applied to a gas of @xmath10 interacting particles in a harmonic trap .",
    "computing the subdominant eigenpair @xmath11 is a significant shift beyond conventional monte carlo eigenanalysis .",
    "the monte carlo methods based on the power method have long computed just the dominant eigenpair @xmath12 of very large matrices . for the monte",
    "carlo transition matrices , the dominant eigenvalue is known and must be one .",
    "further , the left and right hand dominant eigenvectors are also known .",
    "if @xmath13 is column stochastic , that is , @xmath14 , the right eigenvector is the limiting distribution .",
    "the left eigenvector has all its components being the same positive number .",
    "our method based on a modified power method , uses this information about the dominant eigenpair to focus on obtaining the first subdominant pair .",
    "it starts with the recent very large matrix multiple eigenvalue monte carlo work of booth and gubernatis @xcite and adds to it an algorithm just proposed by yamamoto @xcite .",
    "our approach is significantly different from the one proposed by blte and nightingale @xcite who adapted the variational quantum monte carlo method @xcite for computing a few excited states to the calculation of subdominant eigenvalues . in their modificaton of this variational approach , they utilized knowledge of the dominant eigenpair , and with a multi - parameter trial wavefunction , accomplished high precision estimates of the dynamical exponent for a metropolis simulation of the two - dimensional ising model at the bulk critical point .",
    "important in this method is the quality of the trial wavefunction .",
    "recently , casey _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied this method to a multi - variate gaussian .    in section 2 , we will introduce our method and in section 3 define our models and discuss the details of our simulations .",
    "section 4 contains our results for the ising and harmonic trap models . because ising model simulations have no metropolis box size , we instead varied the algorithm , using the standard single spin - reversal metropolis method , plus single- and multi - site heat bath algorithms . in the last section ,",
    "section 5 , we summarize our results and discuss future work .",
    "most commonly used monte carlo eigenvalue methods are based on the power method .",
    "the power method projects some starting state to the eigenpair of some matrix or operator @xmath15 associated with the eigenvalue of largest absolute value . for a markov chain transition matrix @xmath13 ,",
    "this eigenvalue must always be real , positive , and unity . with an initial state @xmath16 , the power method iterates @xmath17 until some convergence criterion is met . upon convergence ,",
    "the eigenstate of the dominant eigenpair is @xmath18 and the eigenvalue is @xmath19 . any norm may be used . in this paper",
    ", we will use the infinity norm , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the components of @xmath18 in some basis .    to find two eigenpairs",
    ", we need two starting states @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if we were to apply the power method to them independently , each would independently converge to the same dominant eigenpair . to couple the iteration ,",
    "we modify the first step of the power method to be @xmath24 with the intent of converging @xmath25 to the dominate state @xmath26 and @xmath27 to the subdominant state @xmath28 .    to fix values for the @xmath29 s , we start with the matrix - vector form of the defining equation for an eigenpair @xmath30 and note that for any @xmath31 an exact estimator for the eigenvalue is @xmath32 and related exact estimators exist for sums of these components grouped in any number of overlapping or non - overlapping ways @xmath33 this observation puts a constraint on the allowed values of @xmath29 for which the sum @xmath34 is an eigenvector",
    ". if we substitute , @xmath35 into ( [ eq : region_estimator ] ) and cross - muliply the equalities involving @xmath36 and @xmath37 , a quadratic equation for @xmath29 results .",
    "one root of this equation , @xmath38 , makes the eigenvalue estimate @xmath39 associated with @xmath40 larger than the other .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these choices converge @xmath25 and @xmath27 to @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is straight - forward to generalize this method to compute more that two eigenpairs .    following yamamoto @xcite , we modified this method to converge to the subdominant eigenpair using knowledge of the first .",
    "we define @xmath41 after a sufficient number of iterations @xmath42 where @xmath43 we can now solve ( [ eq : new_estimates ] ) for @xmath44 and @xmath45 the @xmath13 s and @xmath46 s are easily computed sums . in computing @xmath47",
    "we use our exact knowledge of @xmath26 , and in computing @xmath48 , we use the exact value of @xmath39 which is unity .",
    "the new power method iterates @xmath49 yamamoto shows that his procedure converges to @xmath0 and @xmath28 provided @xmath50 in what follows , we chose @xmath29 to be close to the lower bound .",
    "both deterministic and monte carlo use of this modified power method are possible . in the following section",
    ", we will give more details of our monte carlo implementation .",
    "in this implementation , we use the _ left _ dominant eigenvector of @xmath15 , that is , the one with uniform positive components .",
    "this choice trivializes the computation of several sums .",
    "we considered both the @xmath51 site one - dimensional model @xmath52 and the @xmath53 site two - dimensional model @xmath54 in an external field @xmath55 .",
    "the ising variables @xmath56 .",
    "we assumed periodic boundary conditions ; that is , @xmath57 in one dimension , and @xmath58 in two dimensions .    for these models , we computed the second eigenvalue for the transition matrices of multiple monte carlo algorithms : the single - site , spin - reversal metropolis algorithm , a single - site heat bath algorithm , and the two and three - site heat bath algorithms .",
    "the algorithms are defined by the transition probability matrix @xmath59 , which in turn defines the probability of jumping from state @xmath60 to @xmath61 . with @xmath10",
    "equal to @xmath51 or @xmath62 , our state is @xmath63 the jump to state @xmath61 produced by the metropolis algorithm has a proposed flip of the ising spin at one site accepted or rejected according to @xmath64.\\ ] ]    the single - site heat bath algorithm transitions the state to itself or to one with the spin reversed at one site .",
    "if @xmath65 is the energy of the state with the single spin reversed and all remaining spins fixed and @xmath66 , then the non - zero elements of @xmath13 are @xmath67 a multiple - site heat - bath algorithm is a natural extension of the above .",
    "the single - site heat - bath algorithm samples one of the two spin states from the conditional boltzmann distribution of a single spin with all the other spin values fixed .",
    "a multiple - site heat - bath algorithm samples the state of several neighboring spins with the rest fixed . for an @xmath68-site algorithm one of @xmath69 states is selected .    for each of these algorithms",
    ", we computed the second eigenvalue deterministically using standard eigensystem software for small lattices , deterministically using ( [ eq : modified_power_method ] ) for slightly larger lattices , and stochastically using ( [ eq : modified_power_method ] ) for still larger lattices .",
    "we will now give the details of the monte carlo approach .",
    "the monte carlo method implements the modified power method by using a collection of @xmath70 random walkers , each specified by a weight @xmath71 and a spin configuration state @xmath60 .",
    "the number of these states is @xmath72 .",
    "we represented a spin configuration by an integer @xmath73 in the range 0 to @xmath74 where each bit of this integer corresponds to a lattice site and a plus ising spin maps to a set bit and a minus spin maps to an unset one .",
    "the weight represents the component of the subdominant eigenstate in the spin - configuration basis ( [ eq : spin_configuration ] ) .",
    "monte carlo becomes necessary when this number is too large for a deterministic calculation .",
    "the monte carlo method is most powerful when @xmath75 .",
    "the algorithm estimates the eigenvalue by using the walkers in the exact estimators ( [ eq : estimator ] ) and ( [ eq : region_estimator ] ) not by using them in a variational estimator @xcite .",
    "this use needs two regions . in general , the choice of regions is not critical @xcite , as long as they are populated by a sufficient number of walkers so that the walkers are representative of the eigenstate in that region .",
    "regions therefore do not necessarily have to be exclusive and can overlap .",
    "for the zero - field ising model , our regions were all states with an up - spin majority and all states with a down - spin majority .",
    "we note this means states with equal numbers of up and down spins do not contribute to the estimation . this choice accommodated the fact that as the lattice size increases most of the walkers at low temperature are either in the all spins - up or all spins - down state . in the non - zero - field simulations ,",
    "one region was the one state with all spins aligned with the magnetic field and several adjacent nearly all - aligned states ( the number of adjacent states that needed to be included with the all - aligned state scaled with system size ) ; the other region was all other states .",
    "in contrast to the dominant eigenstate , which must have only non - negative components , the subdominant eigenstate must have some negative components . while not essential , it is helpful if the initial walker weights mix plus and minus signs .",
    "while use of starting states whose variational energy is a significantly better approximate to the answer is possible , their use was unnecessary for the present study .    for each walker in state @xmath76 , we need to sample @xmath59 to produce a walker in the state @xmath77 . to do this we used two lists , one for the current walkers and one for the new ones produced by a monte carlo method that samples a state @xmath77 from the cumulative probability function of @xmath59 , that is , from @xmath78 . with this procedure",
    "we produce one new walker for every old one .",
    "the third step in the algorithm , which updates the discrete components @xmath79 of @xmath16 after adding or removing a contribution from the corresponding component of the known dominant eigenstate , can mix oppositely signed walkers contributing to the same state @xmath76 .",
    "it is essential for a correct solution to have oppositely - signed walkers cancel properly . instead of using the weight cancellation methods developed in @xcite",
    ", we tried a simpler method : after the generation of the new list of walkers is complete , we scan it , identify all walkers in the same state , that is , identified by the same positive integer , and replace them with one walker whose weight is the sum of contributing walkers weights .",
    "this list compression procedure worked well .",
    "as the iteration progresses , the repeated matrix - vector multiplication creates some very large - weighted walkers and some very small - weighted ones .",
    "it is inefficient to process the small - weighted ones .",
    "accordingly , after we compressed our list , we eliminated the small - weighted ones by a weight cut - off procedure : we scan the list , and if a @xmath80 fell below @xmath81 , then we would draw a random number @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath82 was larger than @xmath83 , we would keep this walker but would increase its weight to @xmath84 .",
    "otherwise , we would remove it from the list .",
    "we used @xmath85 .",
    "the weight cut - off procedure reduces the number of walkers .",
    "if reduced too much , say by a half , we replenished the walker population size by replacing the largest - weighted walkers with @xmath86 walkers with weight @xmath87 until the list size was approximately restored to its original size .      for models in the continuum , we considered a gas of @xmath10 interacting classical particles in a harmonic trap .",
    "we intend this to be a simple model of a `` cold atom '' system .",

    "the @xmath91 are the particle displacements from the trap center .",
    "we chose @xmath92 , a rather artificial interaction but one staging a competition between the tendency of particles to roam freely and independently within the externally - generated harmonic trapping potential and the tendency to position themselves within a distance of @xmath93 of each other to accommodate their mutual interactions .",
    "we always chose @xmath94 .",
    "for this model , we computed the second eigenvalue for the metropolis algorithm . here , the transition probability for jumping from position @xmath89 to @xmath95 is @xmath96.\\ ] ] the metropolis algorithm proposes a phase space position change one particle at a time , say changing @xmath91 to @xmath97 .",
    "the proposal samples an @xmath97 from @xmath98 where @xmath99 unless @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is a cutoff appropriate to the potential .",
    "the random number @xmath82 is chosen uniformly in the interval @xmath102 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is called the metropolis box size .",
    "the proposed change is accepted if @xmath103 is greater than another random number @xmath82 chosen uniformly in @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath101 and @xmath3 may be varied widely .",
    "their ratio is what principally affects the second eigenvalues obtained .",
    "our monte carlo strategy was analogous to the one we used for the ising model , but some details were adjusted to move from discrete to continuous states . in short , we mapped the continuum problem onto a discrete one .",
    "we represented each walker by a weight @xmath105 and phase space position @xmath89 , divided phase space into cells , and formed cell lists grouping walkers into the cells .",
    "we then defined components for the various @xmath16 and @xmath18 states by mapping a combination of cell numbers and particle numbers onto a positive integer .",
    "we thus defined discrete states , but ones typically containing many walkers .",
    "finally , the weights of the walkers in each state were replaced by their average weight . except where otherwise noted , the cell width in each phase space dimension was 0.05 .",
    "we observed that we could reduce the needed number of walkers by varying the widths .",
    "the number of walkers expected to occupy cells at the extreme ends of the trap , for example , is much smaller than the number expected to occupy cells at the bottom of the trap .",
    "therefore , enlarging the cell widths above 0.05 units at the far ends of the trap enabled a reduction in the number of walkers .",
    "the optimal size of the cells at the far ends of the trap varied with the temperature , but could be optimized by increasing the size of these cells to the maximum size before convergence could no longer be achieved .",
    "we found these sizes ranged from 0.05 to 0.5 times the core cell width .",
    "the infinity norm of the eigenvector needed in step 5 of the algorithm was now taken to be the largest absolute value of the cell weights .",
    "we also need to define regions to calculate the parameters needed in the updating step 3 .",
    "our definitions were simple : the first region included all walkers with all @xmath106 , while the second region included all walkers with all @xmath107 .",
    "other choices of regions are possible , but were not thoroughly explored .",
    "our weight control and population resizing procedures were the same as those used in the ising simulations . assigning each walker in the same cell their average weight was our only weight cancellation procedure .",

    ", the magnitudes of the eigenvalues always decrease monotonically with increasing temperature . for reduced temperatures less than one , the eigenvalues closely approach unity .",
    "the metropolis algorithm approaches unity faster than the heat - bath algorithm .",
    "while not shown , we remark that the second eigenvalue of all algorithms increase with lattice size , pushing the approach to unity to higher reduced temperatures .",

    "for the cases presented , the acceptance ratio is around @xmath132 .    besides the number of walkers",
    ", the accuracy of the results also depends on the cell width .",
    "the value of 0.05 was found by experimentation to be convenient both with respect to accuracy and efficiency .",
    "typical numbers of walkers ranged from 50,000 to 200,000 as the number of particles was increased from one to three .",
    "fewer walkers could be used for higher temperatures than for lower ones for the same system .",
    "we proposed and benchmarked a numerical method for computing the subdominant eigenvalue @xmath0 of a matrix or continuous operator . based on the work of @xcite and @xcite , this method",
    "can be implemented deterministically and stochastically , computes just this one eigenvalue , and requires knowing the dominant eigenpair . for markov chain transition matrices ,",
    "this pair is known analytically so we used the method to compute the @xmath0 of various transition matrices . for such matrices @xmath133 , with small @xmath1 implying large monte carlo efficiency",
    "specifically , we computed the @xmath0 of the transition matrices for several one and two dimensional ising models , which have a discrete phase space , and compared the relative efficiencies of the metropolis and heat - bath algorithms as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field .",
    "based on the @xmath0 criterion , we found that small lattices appear to give an adequate picture of comparative efficiency and that the heat - bath algorithm is more efficient than the metropolis algorithm only at low temperatures where both algorithms are inefficient .",
    "we also computed the @xmath0 of the transition matrix of a model of an interacting gas trapped by a harmonic potential , which has a mutidimensional continuous phase space , and studied the efficiency of the metropolis algorithm as a function of temperature and the maximum allowable step size @xmath3 .",
    "we found that the traditional rule - of - thumb of adjusting @xmath3 so the metropolis acceptance rate is around 50% range is often sub - optimal .",
    "in general , as a function of temperature or @xmath3 , @xmath0 for this model displays trends defining optimal efficiency that the acceptance ratio does not .",
    "the cases studied also suggest that monte carlo simulations for a continuum model in the continuum are likely more efficienct than those for a discretized version of the model .",
    "many of our results and conclusions , of course , could be limited to these specific cases ; however , we suggest establishing their degree generality would be advantageous . for example",
    ", we quantified situations where focusing on acceptance ratios is ill advised . from our experience , this result is not very surprising .",
    "clearly , computing @xmath0 is more justified and gave more specific information about which of several algorithmic approaches or adjustments is likely preferable .",
    "more interestingly , if we can always capture efficiency trends for small systems sizes , this is a significant simplification .",
    "our monte carlo techniques were simple . in treating more complicated problems , we might need some of the methods used in @xcite plus others .",
    "our techniques and approach were also quite different than those by @xcite .",
    "for example , our starting functions were considerably simpler to construct , and we did not need to use these functions as an importance function guiding our random walkers . additionally , we used exact estimators for the eigenvalue estimates instead of variational ones . on other hand",
    ", we must be concerned with the cancellation of positively and negatively signed walkers .",
    "our procedures for doing so however where quite simple and effective , and our success means we solved a type of sign problem .",
    "we do not expect our eigenvalues to be as precise as is possible with this other method . in most cases ,",
    "our eigenvalues estimate errors were smaller than marker sizes .",
    "for present high precision in these estimates is unnecessary .",
    "more advantageous starting functions could easily be used if needed .",
    "the most substantive issue for future work is more fully understanding the utility of @xmath0 as a metric for comparative algorithmic efficiency .",
    "focusing on this quantity has the advantage of it being well defined and backed by some rigorous results . from a practical point of view , the most efficient algorithm is the one that produces a measurement of a required accuracy with the less amount of computer time .",
    "using @xmath0 does not address the time is takes to perform a monte carlo step ; it only says something about the number of steps needed .",
    "experience has shown that the fast or slow relaxation of an algorithm is generally accompanied by fast of slow generation of statistically independent measurements .",
    "likely a good @xmath0 is a necessary but not sufficient rule - of - thumb .",
    "we note that peskun s result ( [ eq : peskun ] ) insures the variance of any measurable of algorithm 1 will be less than of equal to that computed from algorithm 2 .",
    "the connection of @xmath0 to his result about measurables is indirect .",
    "the basic equation for a markov chain is @xmath134 here , @xmath135 is the stationary probability density of the chain and @xmath13 is the transition probability density defining the chain .",
    "they satisfy @xmath136 the metropolis algorithm makes a specific choice for the transition probability density @xmath137 } \\mathord{\\left/   { \\vphantom { { \\exp \\left [ { - \\beta v\\left ( y \\right ) } \\right ] } { \\exp \\left [ { - \\beta v\\left ( x \\right ) } \\right ] } } } \\right .",

    "we will show that for potentials of the form @xmath121 the product of this choice of the proposal probability density and the standard metropolis acceptance density @xmath142 } \\mathord{\\left/   { \\vphantom { { \\exp \\left [ { - \\beta v\\left ( y \\right ) } \\right ] } { \\exp \\left [ { - \\beta v\\left ( x \\right ] } \\right ) } } } \\right .",
    "\\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace } { \\exp \\left [ { - \\beta v\\left ( x \\right ) } \\right ] } } } \\right\\}\\ ] ] lead to a scaling of @xmath143 that implies all it eigenvalues scale as a function of @xmath122    we will measure all lengths in units of @xmath3 and start by writing the acceptance function as @xmath144 to make the @xmath145 dependence explicit .",
    "next , for potentials of the type @xmath121 @xmath146 } } } \\right .",
    "\\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace } { \\exp \\left ( { - \\frac{{x^n } } { t } } \\right ) } } } \\right\\ } \\\\   & = & \\min \\left\\ { { 1,{{\\exp \\left [ { - \\frac{{\\left ( { \\frac{y}{\\delta } } \\right)^n } } { { \\left ( { \\frac{t}{{\\delta ^n } } } \\right ) } } } \\right ] } \\mathord{\\left/   { \\vphantom { { \\exp \\left [ { - \\frac{{\\left ( { \\frac{y}{\\delta } } \\right)^n } } { { \\left ( { \\frac{t}{{\\delta ^n } } } \\right ) } } } \\right ] } { \\exp \\left [ { - \\frac{{\\left ( { \\frac{x}{\\delta } } \\right)^n } } { { \\left ( { \\frac{t}{{\\delta ^n } } } \\right ) } } } \\right ] } } } \\right .   \\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace } { \\exp \\left [ { - \\frac{{\\left ( { \\frac{x}{\\delta } } \\right)^n } } { { \\left ( { \\frac{t}{{\\delta ^n } } } \\right ) } } } \\right ] } } } \\right\\ } \\\\ & = & a\\left ( { \\frac{x}{\\delta } , \\frac{y}{\\delta } ; \\frac{t}{{\\delta ^n } } } \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , from the point of view of the acceptance , going from @xmath147 to @xmath148 at temperature @xmath145 is the same as going from @xmath149 to @xmath150 at @xmath151 .",
    "we now write @xmath152 which distributes @xmath148 uniformly over an interval centered at @xmath147 and of width @xmath3 , that is , @xmath153 over this interval its amplitude is @xmath141 .",
    "next , we consider @xmath154 a function that distributes @xmath149 uniformly over this unit interval and has a unit amplitude will make an acceptable proposal probability .",
    "such a function is @xmath155 thus for the scaled system we have @xmath156 which establishes the scaling of all the eigenvalues of @xmath157                                as a guide to the choice of regions , we comment left and right eigenstate corresponding to different eigenvalue are orthogonal .",
    "the subdominant state we seek is thus orthogonal to the dominant right - hand state which is the boltzmann distribution .",
    "likely good choice of regions will reflect regions with high boltzmann weight .      because the eigenvalues depend on box size",
    ", it is very possible that there are minima in these graphs , only at very large box sizes .",
    "so , it is likely that one should not increase the box size endlessly , just increasing it at high temperatures more than at low temperatures ."
