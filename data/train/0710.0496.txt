    "however , such an anomalously strong magnetoelectric effect seems to be an unexpexted feature for a system with @xmath19-holes and a nearly perfect highly symmetric chain structure with the edge - shared cuo@xmath15 plaquettes which both are unfavourable for a strong spin - electric coupling .",

    "the authors@xcite are forced to assume a colossal magnitude of this fictious field resulting in an enormous zeeman splitting of several ev .",
    "second , katsura _",
    "et al._@xcite start with an unrealistic for 3d - oxides strong spin - orbital coupling limit for @xmath29 electrons@xcite which formally implies @xmath30 and a full neglect of the low - symmetry crystal field and orbital quenching effect.@xcite the authors@xcite do heavily ( up to two orders of magnitude ! ) overestimate the numerical value of the overlap dipole matrix element @xmath31 which defines maximal value of respective electric dipole moments .",
    "it seems , the authors ignore the well developed techniques to proceed with @xmath2-covalency , exchange , and spin - orbital coupling in 3d oxides .",
    "alternative mechanism of giant magnetoelectricity based on the antisymmetric dm type magnetoelastic coupling was proposed recently by sergienko and dagotto.@xcite however , here we meet with a `` weak '' contributor .",
    "indeed , the minimal value of @xmath32 parameter ( @xmath33 ) needed to explain experimental phase transition in multiferroic manganites is two orders of magnitude larger than the reasonable microscopic estimations.@xcite    in our opinion , a misunderstanding exists regarding the relative role of the off - center ionic displacements ( lattice effects ) and electronic contributions to a resultant electric polarization .",
    "many authors consider the giant multiferroicity requires the existence of sizeable atomic displacements and structural distortions.@xcite one would expect a transition to a structure with polar symmetry to occur at the onset of ferroelectricity , but neutron diffraction studies thus far have failed to find direct evidence of such changes.@xcite earlier synchrotron x - ray studies found some evidence of lattice modulation in the ferroelectric phase of ymn@xmath4o@xmath5,@xcite though the atomic displacements seem to be extremely small .",
    "other structural works have not reported any signature of atomic displacements @xmath34 at the ferroelectric phase transition which can explain the polarization observed in this family of compounds .",
    "this questions the microscopic model by harris _",

    "however , several phonons in tbmn@xmath4o@xmath5 exhibit clesr correlations to the ferroelectricity of these materials.@xcite the signatures of the loss of inversion symmetry in the ferroelectric phase were found by the appearance of a infrared active phonon that was only raman active in the paraelectric phase . a seeming contradiction",
    ", we think a result of an oversimplified approach to the lattice dynamics .",
    "indeed , the effects of nuclear displacements and electron polarization should be described on equal footing , e.g. , in frames of the well - known shell model of dick and overhauser @xcite widely used in lattice dynamics . in frames of the model the ionic configuration with filled electron shells is considered to be composed of an outer spherical shell of 2(2l+1 ) electrons and a core consisting of the nucleus and the remaining electrons . in an electric field the rigid shell retains its spherical charge distribution but moves bodily with respect to the core .",
    "the polarizability is made finite by a harmonic restoring force of spring constant @xmath36 which acts between the core and shell .",
    "the shells of two ions repel one another and tend to become displaced with respect to the ion cores because of this repulsion .",
    "shell and core displacements may be of comparable magnitude .",
    "the conventional shell model does not take into account the spin and orbital degrees of freedom , hence it can not describe the multiferroic effects .",
    "in fact , the displacements of both the atomic core and electron shell would depend on the spin surroundings producing the sinergetic effect of spin - dependent electric polarization . obviously , this effect manifest itself differently in neutron and x - ray diffraction experiments .",

    "the authors of recent papers refs . made use of _ first principles _ calculations to examine the spin - dependent electric polarization in the orthorhombic multiferroic homno@xmath3@xcite and in spin spiral chain cuprates and .@xcite however , their results are highly questionable since the basic starting points of the current versions of such spin - polarized approaches as the lsda exclude any possibility to obtain a reliable quantitative estimation of the spin - dependent electric polarization in multiferroics . indeed , the basic drawback of the spin - polarized approaches is that these start with a local density functional in the form ( see , e.g. ref . ) @xmath37+\\delta",

    "magnitude of the field is considered to be governed by the intra - atomic hund exchange , while its orientation does by the effective molecular , or inter - atomic exchange fields . despite the supposedly spin nature of the field it produces an unphysically giant spin - dependent rearrangement of the charge density that can not be reproduced within any conventional technique operating with spin hamiltonians .",
    "furthermore , a direct link with the orientation of the field makes the effect of the spin configuration onto the charge distribution to be unphysically large .",
    "similar effects can not be reproduced in frames of any conventional heisenberg model . in general ,",
    "the lsda method to handle a spin degree of freedom is absolutely incompatible with a conventional approach based on the spin hamiltonian concept .",
    "there are some intractable problems with a match making between the conventional formalism of a spin hamiltonian and lsda approach to the exchange and exchange - relativistic effects .",
    "visibly plausible numerical results for different exchange and exchange - relativistic parameters reported in many lsda investigations ( see , e.g. , refs . ) evidence only a potential capacity of the lsda based models for semiquantitative estimations , rather than for reliable quantitative data .",
    "it is worth noting that for all of these `` advantageous '' instances the matter concerns the handling of certain classical nel - like spin configurations ( ferro- , antiferro- , spiral , ... ) and search for a compatibility with a mapping made with a conventional quantum spin hamiltonian .",
    "it s quite another matter when one addresses the search of the charge density redistribution induced by a spin configuration .",
    "in such a case the straightforward application of the lsda scheme can lead to an unphysical overestimation of the effects or even to qualitatively incorrect results due to an unphysical effect of a breaking of spatial symmetry induced by a spin configuration . as an example , we refer to the papers by picozzi _",
    "et al._@xcite and xiang and whangbo @xcite where the authors made use of the _ first - principle _ lsda calculations to study the microscopic origin of ferroelectricity induced by magnetic order in orthorhombic homno@xmath3 and in quasi-1d cuprates licu@xmath4o@xmath4 and licuvo@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the calculated total nonrelativistic polarization of the afm - e phase in homno@xmath3 exceeds the experimentally measured one by more than three orders of magnitude . in terms of a conventional scheme",
    "the afm - e ordering turns out to be accompanied by a colossal exchange striction of the order of several percents that exceeds all the thinkable magnitudes ( see table i in ref . ) .",
    "the relativistic lsda calculations for the optimized structures of quasi-1d cuprates@xcite yield the results that disagree with experiment both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "again we see an unphysically strong overestimation of the spin - induced electric polarization .",
    "interestingly , that the making use of experimental centrosymmetric structures leads to a strong suppression by order of magnitude of the calculated polarizations , clearly confirming the unphysically strong lsda overestimation of spin - induced structural and charge density distortions . summarizing ,",
    "we should emphasize two weak points of so - called _ first - principle calculations _ which appear as usual to be well forgotten in the literature .",
    "first , these approaches imply the spin configuration induces immediately the appropriate kinematic breaking of spatial symmetry that makes the symmetry - breaking effect of a spin configuration unphysically large .",
    "conventional schemes imply just opposite , however , a physically reasonable picture when the charge and orbital anisotropies induce a spin anisotropy .",
    "second , these neglect quantum fluctuations , that restricts drastically their applicability to a correct description of the high - order perturbation effects .",
    "overall , the lsda approach seems to be more or less justified for a semiquantitative description of exchange coupling effects for materials with a classical nel - like collinear magnetic order .",
    "however , it can lead to erroneous results for systems and effects where the symmetry breaking and quantum fluctuations are of a principal importance such as : i ) noncollinear spin configurations , in particular , quantum s=1/2 magnets , ii ) relativistic effects , such as the symmetric spin anisotropy , antisymmetric dm coupling , and , iii ) spin - dependent electric polarization .",
    "indeed , a correct treatment of these high - order perturbation effects needs in a correct account both of local symmetry and of quantum fluctuations(see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the spin - current scenario by katsura _",
    "@xcite starts with the same lsda - like assumption of unphysically large symmetry - breaking spin - magnetic field .",
    "surprisingly , despite the problems with the model validation and quantitative estimations the spin - current mechanism is currently addressed to be responsible for the emergence of ferroelectric polarization in new multiferroics such as orthorhombic rmno@xmath3 , ni@xmath3v@xmath4o@xmath17 , mnwo@xmath15 , cocr@xmath4o@xmath15 , cufeo@xmath4 where the inversion symmetry breaking is related to noncollinear spiral magnetic structures.@xcite `` ferroelectricity caused by spin - currents '' has established itself as the leading paradigm for both theoretical and experimental investigations in the field of strong multiferroic coupling . however , a `` rule '' that chiral symmetry needs to be broken in order to induce a ferroelectric moment at a magnetic phase transition is questionable .",
    "moreover , there are increasing doubts whether weak exchange - relativistic coupling can generate giant electric polarization observed in multiferroics .",
    "thus we may assert that a true microscopic mechanism of giant magnetoelectric effect is still missing .    below we propose a systematic microscopic theory of spin - dependent electric polarization which implies the derivation of effective spin operators for nonrelativistic and relativistic contributions to electric polarization of the generic three - site two - hole cluster such as cu@xmath27-o - cu@xmath4 and does not imply any fictious zeeman fields to align the spins .",
    "we make use of conventional well - known approaches to account for the @xmath2-covalent effects , intra - atomic correlations , crystal field , and spin - orbital coupling . despite the description",
    "is focused on cu@xmath27-o - cu@xmath4 clusters typical for different cuprates , the generalization of the results on the m@xmath27-o - m@xmath4 clusters in other 3d oxides is trivial .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we consider the effects of @xmath2 covalency and spin - orbital coupling in a three - site two - hole cu@xmath27-o - cu@xmath4 cluster .",
    "nonrelativistic and relativistic mechanisms of spin - dependent electric polarization with local and nonlocal terms are discussed in secs.iii and iv , respectively . in sec.v",
    "we address an alternative approach to nonrelativistic mechanism of spin - dependent electric polarization induced by a parity - breaking exchange interaction . in sec.vi",
    "we show a lack of the spin - dependent electric polarization effects for an isolated cuo@xmath4 chain .",
    "before proceeding with electric polarization effects we address the generic three - site m@xmath27-o - m@xmath4 cluster which forms a basic element of crystalline and electron structure for 3d oxides .",
    "a realistic perturbation scheme needed to describe the active m 3d and o 2p electron states implies the strong intra - atomic correlations , the comparable effect of crystal field , the quenching of orbital moments by low - symmetry crystal field , account for the dp - transfer up to the fourth order effects , and rather small spin - orbital coupling . to this end",
    "we make use of a technique suggested in refs.@xcite to derive the expressions for the copper and oxygen spin - orbital contributions to dzyaloshinsky - moriya coupling in copper oxides .",
