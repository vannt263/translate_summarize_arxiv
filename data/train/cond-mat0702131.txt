    "a convenient way to characterize disorder - dominated phases is through the statistics of some appropriate `` weights '' . in mean - field models , these weights represent either weights of pure states , as in the replica analysis of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite , or weights of microscopic configurations , as in the random energy model @xcite or in the directed polymer model on the cayley tree @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in these three cases , the weights statistics is the same as in lvy sums with some index @xmath29 @xcite , where the index @xmath30 depends on the temperature : for instance in the random energy model @xcite or in the directed polymer model on the cayley tree @xcite , it is simply @xmath31 . in @xcite , the corresponding probability distributions of the weights were found to exhibit characteristic singularities at some integer inverses .",
    "similar derrida - flyvbjerg singularities also occur in many other contexts , such as randomly broken objects @xcite , in population genetics @xcite , in random walk excursions or loops @xcite .    for disordered systems in finite dimensions",
    ", it seems appropriate to consider the weights associated to a local degree of freedom , to characterize to what extent it is frozen . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this idea has first been introduced to characterize the freezing of a folded polymer with random self - interactions @xcite .",
    "it was then used in the context of secondary structures of random rna to analyse the fraction of frozen pairs between degenerate ground states @xcite , and to characterize the freezing transition @xcite .    in this paper , we study the statistics of the weights @xmath6 of the end - point of a directed polymer in a random potentiel @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the low - temperature @xmath0 disorder - dominated phase both in dimension @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 ) , since we have studied elsewhere @xcite the weights statistics at criticality in @xmath32 , where multifractal behavior occurs .",
    "we are not aware of previous studies on these weights in the physics literature . on the contrary , in the mathematical litterature",
    ", the weight of the favourite site has been considered as a localization criterion @xcite , and a more detailed description of end - point weights was then given via the notion of @xmath33-atoms @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model and observables are introduced in section [ model ] .",
    "we then present a detailed study of the weights of the end - point of the directed polymer both in dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath3 . for clarity ,",
    "the statistical properties of the weights alone , independently of the distances involved are described in section [ poids ] , whereas the study of spatial properties is postponed to section [ spatial ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper , we present numerical results for the random bond version of the model defined by the recursion relation on a cubic lattice in @xmath34 and @xmath32 @xmath35 the bond energies @xmath36 are random independent variables drawn from the gaussian distribution @xmath37 in this paper , we consider the following boundary conditions .",

    ", there exists a disorder dominated phase , where the order parameter is an ` overlap ' . in finite dimensions ,",
    "a scaling droplet theory was proposed @xcite , in direct correspondence with the droplet theory of spin - glasses @xcite , whereas in the mean - field version of the model on the cayley , a freezing transition very similar to the one occurring in the random energy model was found @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram as a function of space dimension @xmath43 is the following @xcite . in dimension",
    "@xmath44 , there is no free phase , i.e. any initial disorder drives the polymer into the strong disorder phase , whereas for @xmath45 , there exists a phase transition between the low temperature disorder dominated phase and a free phase at high temperature @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the statistical properties of the weights @xmath46 normalized to ( eq .
