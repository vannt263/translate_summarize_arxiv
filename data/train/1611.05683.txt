    "the accurate treatment of the adsorption of molecules on surfaces is a major challenge of materials modelling , with important applications in nanotechnologies and science : heterogeneous catalysis , sensors , corrosion , lubrication , friction and coatings , to name but a few .",
    "an important case to study is that of clays .",
    "clay minerals are natural aluminosilicates that find uses in a wide variety of fields such as medicine , adhesives , paints and oil drilling.@xcite they also act as catalysts to ice nucleation in the atmosphere@xcite and help cleanse soils and groundwater through adsorption of pollutants .",
    "a clear understanding of how molecules interact with the surfaces of clays is of the utmost importance to understand , improve and control such processes .",
    "reliable reference data from theory and simulation is of intrinsic value and often important as a complement to experiments.@xcite computer simulations of water - surface interactions , at the molecular level , are often based on force fields ( ff ) and density functional theory ( dft ) approaches.@xcite although these techniques are incredibly powerful and useful , there are cases where their accuracy is not satisfactory .",
    "ff potentials have parameters that have to be fit in order to reproduce experimental results or higher lever theoretical benchmarks , and this is not always straightforward .",
    "dft is traditionally more accurate than ffs but at a larger computational cost .",
    "unfortunately , dft results are highly sensitive to the choice of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional used and nowadays there are countless xc functionals to choose from.@xcite in the field of materials science , the description of weak bonding interactions , and in particular london dispersion forces , is one of the most important challenges .",
    "immense progress has been made in this area recently,@xcite however , there is no rigorous way to systematically improve xc functionals and as a result validation with alternative methods is needed . of the various high level reference methods",
    "available,@xcite quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) is a powerful approach for obtaining benchmark values for solids , surfaces and large molecular systems .",
    "qmc , within the fixed node diffusion monte - carlo ( dmc ) approach has already been used to tackle interesting materials science problems that have been beyond the reach of dft ( see e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "this has provided reference data which has exposed shortcomings in existing ff models and dft xc functionals , which in turn aids the development of such approaches .        in this paper",
    "we will use two qmc approaches to investigate molecular adsorption on a clay surface , namely dmc and lattice regularized diffusion monte carlo@xcite ( lrdmc ) .",
    "the particular clay we will examine is kaolinite ( @xmath0 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaolinite_bulk ] . since the first outline of the kaolinite crystal structure by pauling in 1930,@xcite numerous structural studies using x - ray and neutron powder diffraction,@xcite x - ray single crystal , @xcite and electron diffraction methods , @xcite as well as theoretical studies",
    "@xcite have been carried out on kaolinite .",
    "consequently it is one of the most suitable aluminosilicate clays to assess the performance of various theoretical methods .",
    "in addition , when looking at adsorption processes on kaolinte , cleavage along the ( 001 ) basal plane leads to exposure of either aluminate and silicate faces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kaolinite_bulk ] ) .",
    "the aluminate ( @xmath1 ) face is terminated in hydroxyl groups and as a result is regarded as hydrophilic , whereas the silicate ( @xmath2 ) face which exposes saturated @xmath3 groups , is considered to be hydrophobic .",
    "the distinct chemical nature of these two surfaces means that adsorbates will interact differently with them , making kaolinite an interesting case study for understanding the role of vdw forces on the adsorption at clay mineral surfaces .    in what follows",
    ", we will provide benchmark values for the adsorption of water and methanol molecules at the pristine hydroxyl- and silicate - terminated ( 001 ) faces of kaolinite , by using dmc and lrdmc .",
    "then , we probe dft xc functionals by considering a range of generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functionals , hybrid functionals and dispersion corrected density functionals which account for vdw forces . in the case of molecules adsorbed on kaolinite",
    "we find that the bare ggas and hybrids are quite unreliable : as expected adsorption energies are underestimated , but more importantly , the relative adsorption energies of water versus methanol do not even agree with qmc .",
    "moreover , on the silicate - terminated face the molecules hardly bind at all and move quite far from the surface during geometry optimizations .",
    "accounting for vdw forces improves adsorption energies significantly and stabilizes the structures .",
    "however most of the vdw - corrected and vdw - inclusive functionals predict adsorption energies which are slightly too large compared to qmc .",
    "this indicated that there remains room for improvement in terms of how vdw forces are handled in dft .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we outline the key computational details of our simulations .",
    "since a range of techniques has been used , for brevity the more detailed descriptions of the computational setups are provided in the supporting information .",
    "qmc and dft evaluations of the adsorption of water and methanol at both ( 001 ) faces of kaolinite are reported and discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and draw conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "adsorption was examined on a single layer of kaolinite , a system with 2d periodicity along the a and b axes as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaolinite_bulk ] .",
    "the simulated supercell was @xmath4 the conventional unit cell of bulk kaolinite ( _ ca . _",
    "10.38    @xmath5  9.01   ) and comprises of 8 aluminiums , 8 silicons , 36 oxygens and 16 hydrogens for the kaolinite slab , plus the atoms of the adsorbed molecule .",
    "note that with _ ca .",
    "_ 300 electrons the simulations are large for qmc calculations .",
    "the adsorption energy , @xmath6 , of the molecule @xmath7 at the face @xmath8 of the kaolinite layer , where @xmath7 can either be the water ( @xmath9 ) or the methanol ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath8 can be the hydroxyl - terminated ( @xmath1 ) face or the silicate - terminated ( @xmath2 ) face , can be evaluated in two ways : the first method , hereafter called _ complex - minus - fragments _ , is computed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total energy for the system with @xmath7 at the @xmath8-face of the kaolinite slab , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the total energies of the isolated slab and the isolated molecule @xmath15 , respectively ; the second method , hereafter called _ complex - minus - far _ , is computed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total energy of a system where the kaolinite slab and the molecule @xmath7 are far enough apart that their interaction is negligible .",
    "the two methods are equivalent if and only if : ( i ) the size - effects due to the periodicity of the system are negligible ; and ( ii ) the electronic structure calculations are performed with methods that are exactly size - consistent . if these conditions are not satisfied in general we have that @xmath18 , meaning that eqs .",
    "[ eqn : eads1 ] and [ eqn : eads2 ] provide different evaluations of the adsorption energies .",
    "in particular , whenever size - effects are detected , the _ complex - minus - far _ method usually benefits from a larger error cancellation . on the other hand , in cases where size - effects are negligible and electronic structure methods are size - consistent ,",
    "there are no residual interactions between the molecule and the periodic partners , then the _ complex - minus - fragments _ method is usually to be preferred .",
    "the reason for that is the computational cost : for a system with @xmath19 electrons the computation is proportional to @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ( _ e.g. _ , in dft @xmath22 is typically between 2 and 3 , and in qmc between 3 and 4 ) , so the cost for calculations of @xmath13 and @xmath23 are cheaper than @xmath24 . moreover ,",
    "when several adsorption energies need to be evaluated , @xmath13 is calculated only once , whereas a different calculation of @xmath24 has to be performed for each molecule @xmath25 .",
    "the two qmc approaches used are dmc and lrdmc .",
    "they are both projection monte carlo methods : they can access the electronic ground state energy of the system by iteratively projecting an initial trial wave function @xmath26 into the ground state , with the constraint that the projected wave function @xmath27 has the same nodal surface of an appropriately chosen guiding function @xmath28 ( fixed node approximation).@xcite both the trial and the guiding wave functions are parametrized functions , and they have to be the best approximation of the ground state that we can provide ( given the constraint of their ansatz ) .",
    "thus , usually they are taken such that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the best function obtained within a variational monte carlo approach , with the variational parameters optimized in order to minimize either the variational energy or the variance .",
    "whenever @xmath28 has the exact nodal surface , the approach is exact , otherwise it gives the best approximation of the ground state given the fixed node constraint .    in projection monte",
    "carlo approaches there is a second approximation in how the projection is performed , and it is different in dmc and lrdmc .",
    "the projection in dmc comes from the imaginary time scrdinger equation ; it is implemented as an imaginary time evolution , where a time - step @xmath31 has to be chosen .",
    "the chosen @xmath31 is a trade - off between accuracy and computational cost : exact results are obtained for @xmath32 , but the computational cost is @xmath33 .",
    "the finite time - step error can be controlled by performing several calculations with different values of @xmath31 and finally extrapolating to the continuum limit @xmath34 . however , in big systems like those considered here , the extrapolation is impractical and sometimes unfeasible or unreliable,@xcite but it is sufficient to consider the results for a @xmath31 small enough that the expected finite - time error is smaller than the required accuracy . here",
    ", we have chosen @xmath31 in order to have an expected time - step error smaller than the stochastic error of the evaluations , see section  si in the supporting information . on the other hand ,",
    "lrdmc is based on the spatial discretization of the molecular hamiltonian on a lattice of mesh size @xmath35 , and it resorts to the projection scheme used also in the green function monte carlo algorithm.@xcite the error induced by the finite mesh size @xmath35 is analogous to the time - step error appearing in standard dmc calculations .",
    "lrdmc preserves the variational principle even when used in combination with nonlocal pseudopotentials@xcite ( pps ) , and it is size - consistent for any value of the mesh @xmath35 , maintaining its efficiency even for systems with a large number of electrons.@xcite both dmc and lrdmc provide excellent benchmark values for weakly interacting systems , as established in a number of studies .",
    "@xcite we used here a standard setup , described in detail in the supporting information . the stochastic error associated with the qmc evaluations of the adsorption",
    "energy is _ ca . _",
    "the systems under consideration are too large for a qmc - based structural optimization , even at the variational level , so the reference structures were those obtained from the pbe - d3 functional , as described in section  [ sec : dftopt ] . as we will see in section  [ sec : results ] , pbe - d3 configurations are in good agreement with those obtained by all the other vdw - inclusive functionals , thus the bias given by the use of pbe - d3 configurations is expected to be small compared to the stochastic error of the dmc evaluation .",
    "there is one aspect of qmc simulations that deserves special care in this specific system , namely the finite - size errors ( fses).@xcite qmc is a many - body method , and in contrast to ( effective ) one - particle methods such as dft , qmc can not simply exploit bloch s theorem in calculations for extended periodic systems .",
    "fses can be taken into account by performing simulations in larger periodic supercells , through the twist - average method,@xcite through corrections to the ewald energy,@xcite or the kwee , zhang , krakauer ( kzk ) method.@xcite in this work we have used the kzk method ( see section  s3 in the supporting information ) .      there is by now an almost limitless variety of dft xc functionals that we could examine.@xcite here we restrict ourselves to : lda functional ; @xcite two gga functionals , pbe,@xcite rpbe;@xcite two hybrid functionals , pbe0,@xcite b3lyp;@xcite three vdw - corrected pbe functionals : pbe - d2@xcite , pbe - d3@xcite ( both from grimme , d3 correction with `` zero - dampling''@xcite ) , and pbe+vdw(ts ) from tkatchenko and scheffler;@xcite two vdw - corrected hybrid functionals , pbe0-d3 , b3lyp - d3@xcite ( both from grimme@xcite ) ; and four self - consistent non - local functionals ( often called vdw - inclusive functionals ) , the original vdw - df from dion ( also named revpbe - vdw),@xcite the second generation vdw - df2,@xcite as well as optpbe - vdw@xcite and optb86b - vdw@xcite from klime _ et al .",
    "_ we stress that the latter four vdw - inclusive functionals are actually based on ggas and basically differ from the vdw - corrected gga functionals ( e.g. , pbe - d2 , pbe - d3 and pbe+vdw(ts ) ) only in the way the dispersion energy is approximated.@xcite other functionals and vdw - corrections have been tested , and results obtained using a comprehensive set of approaches is reported in table  s1 of the supporting information .",
    "adsorption energies were evaluated using the _ complex - minus - fragments _ method , see eq .",
    "[ eqn : eads1 ] , but the results are the same as those obtained with the _ complex - minus - far method _ , as expected .",
    "further details about the setup of the dft calculations are reported in section  s4 of the supporting information .",
    "we also performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations using classical force fields for aqueous water - methanol solutions on kaolinite .",
    "the kaolinite slab was modeled as a single sheet of kaolinite ( approx . @xmath36",
    " ) using the clayff force field,@xcite and the oh bond lengths were constrained using the p - lincs algorithm.@xcite above this slab 538 tip4p/2005 @xcite water and 230 opls / ua methanol@xcite molecules were randomly placed in order to create a liquid film on the kaolinite surface .",
    "the standard lorentz - berthelot mixing rules were used to compute cross - interactions , except to adjust the adsorption energies as detailed below . using the gromacs 4.5 simulation package,@xcite constant volume and temperature dynamics",
    "were propagated using a leap - frog integrator and a nos - hoover chain thermostat , along with replica - exchange amongst eight replicas with temperatures ranging from 275310k in 5k intervals .",
    "real - space interactions were truncated at 9 with corrections to the energy applied and particle - mesh ewald was used to account for long - ranged electrostatics @xcite with the corrections for the slab geometry of the system.@xcite a time step of 2fs was used and molecular dynamics simulations performed for at least 11ns , with the first nanosecond being disregarded as equilibration .",
    "adsorption energies were computed after geometry optimization using the _ complex - minus - fragments _ method .",
    "this was done in three ways : first , the adsorption energy was computed by applying the standard mixing rules .",
    "this yielded adsorption energies of @xmath37mev and @xmath38mev for water and methanol , respectively , and @xmath39mev ; second , the strength of the lennard - jones interaction between the group of methanol and the oxygen atoms of the kaolinite oh groups was adjusted such that @xmath40 matched that of pbe ; finally , the same was done to match @xmath40 obtained by dmc .",
    "water adsorption on the hydroxyl - terminated face of kaolinite has been studied experimentally@xcite and theoretically,@xcite whereas adsorption on the silicate - terminated face is less well studied .",
    "very little is known about methanol adsorption on either face . in the following ,",
    "the most stable adsorption structures identified for water and methanol on the two kaolinite surfaces are presented .    on each surface",
    "a range of adsorption sites was considered , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaolinite_bulk ] . according to the number of h - bonds formed between the adsorbate and the surface",
    ", the adsorption sites can be classified into three categories : threefold , twofold and onefold sites .",
    "the most stable configurations obtained , using dft with the pbe - d3 functional , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ads_refgeo]a[fig : ads_refgeo]h .",
    "these structures have been taken as the reference for dmc , lrdmc and the other dft calculations .",
    "in addition , starting from the reference pbe - d3 structures , we have relaxed the geometries for each of the different functionals considered , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ads_conf]a[fig : ads_conf]d . fig .",
    "[ fig : ads_conf]e compares the distance of the molecules from the slab as obtained with different functionals .",
    "concerning water at the hydroxyl - terminated face ( on ) , all structures initially put in twofold and onefold sites ( a5-a8 ) moved to the threefold site a1 .",
    "this preference for the a1 site agrees with previous dft studies with local@xcite and semi - local@xcite xc functionals . in the most stable configuration , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ads_refgeo]a and [ fig : ads_refgeo]e , the @xmath41 axis of the water molecule lies almost parallel to the plane of the surface .",
    "the water molecule donates one h - bond ( oh - distance of 1.69   ) to and accepts two h - bonds ( 2.01 and 2.04   ) from the surface ( pbe - d3 values ) .",
    "let us now consider the adsorption of methanol at the hydroxyl - terminated face ( on ) .",
    "one way of viewing methanol is as a water molecule with one of its hydrogen atoms replaced by a methyl group .",
    "this leads to two possible types of interaction with the surface : ( i ) hydrogen bond formation with the hydroxyl functional group ; and ( ii ) dispersion interactions arising from the @xmath42 group .",
    "all calculations in which the methanol began parallel to the surface ended with the methanol perpendicular to the surface , maximizing the distance between the @xmath42 group and the kaolinite .",
    "the @xmath42 group can therefore be considered a ` spectator group ' that does not participate directly in the adsorption on the surface .",
    "the adsorption of methanol is therefore very similar to that of water and indeed , we find that a1 is the most favorable site , with the methanol donating one h - bond to and accepting two from the surface .",
    "as was the case for the water structure , the h - bond donated by the methanol is much stronger than the two h - bonds it accepts : 1.68  vs.  1.97 and  2.03   , respectively , with the pbe - d3 functional .",
    "the most stable configuration is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ads_refgeo]b and [ fig : ads_refgeo]f .    as noted above , adsorption of water at the silicate - terminated face ( on ) is less well studied than adsorption at the hydroxyl - terminated face.@xcite of the six adsorption sites ( s1-s6 ) considered here , the onefold s5 site turned out to be the most stable at the gga level , and the twofold s1 generally is the most stable for the vdw - corrected and vdw - inclusive functionals .",
    "the pbe - d3 structure is depicted in figs .",

    "[ fig : ads_refgeo]d and [ fig : ads_refgeo]h .",
    "the leading interaction here is dispersion ; there is no h - bond - like interaction because the oh group of the methanol is parallel to the surface of the slab .          [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "dft calculations were performed using the plane - wave code vasp 5.4.@xcite calculations using the van der waals density functionals were carried out self - consistently using the approach of romn - prez and soler as implemented in vasp by klime _",

    "<S> clay minerals are ubiquitous in nature and the manner in which they interact with their surroundings has important industrial and environmental implications . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , a molecular level understanding of the adsorption of molecules on clay surfaces is crucial . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> computer simulations play an important role , yet the accuracy of widely used empirical force field ( ff ) and density functional theory ( dft ) exchange - correlation functionals is often unclear in adsorption systems dominated by weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> herein we present results from quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) for water and methanol adsorption on the prototypical clay kaolinite . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time qmc has been used to investigate adsorption at a complex , natural surface such as a clay . </S>",
    "<S> as well as being valuable in their own right , the qmc benchmarks obtained provide reference data against which the performance of cheaper dft methods can be tested . indeed using various dft exchange - correlation functionals </S>",
    "<S> yields a very broad range of adsorption energies , and it is unclear _ a priori _ which evaluation is better . </S>",
    "<S> qmc reveals that in the systems considered here it is essential to account for van der waals ( vdw ) dispersion forces since this alters both the absolute and relative adsorption energies of water and methanol . </S>",
    "<S> we show , via ff simulations , that incorrect relative energies can lead to significant changes in the interfacial densities of water and methanol solutions at the kaolinite interface . despite the clear improvements offered by the vdw - corrected and the vdw - inclusive functionals , absolute adsorption energies </S>",
    "<S> are often overestimated , suggesting that the treatment of vdw forces in dft is not yet a solved problem .    </S>",
