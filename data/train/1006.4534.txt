    "most physical , chemical and biological phenomena present intrinsic degrees of randomness . such randomness can be treated within the framework of statistical physics and thermodynamics .",
    "equilibrium thermodynamics , in particular , is a mature discipline with well - established laws @xcite .",
    "however , most natural and engineered processes occur far from equilibrium , e.g. , biomolecular reactions in molecular machines @xcite , oscillations of pumped mesoscopic chemical reaction systems @xcite and fast switching between phonon distributions in optical cavities @xcite .",
    "such processes can not be treated within the framework of classical equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "this fact has motivated an intense activity during the last years aiming at extending the results of thermodynamics to out - of - equilibrium systems @xcite .    in this context , the study of thermodynamic quantities in microscopic systems , such as biomolecules and nanomachines , has posed new challenges due to the ineluctable presence of a brownian noise background , which prevents one from straightforwardly scaling down the approaches employed on macroscopic systems .",
    "for example , the presence of brownian noise alters the measurement of forces acting on microscopic objects , leading to artifacts if not correctly taken into account @xcite .",
    "also the evolution of thermodynamics quantities , e.g. , work and entropy , although deterministic in macroscopic systems , becomes stochastic in the microscopic realm .",
    "indeed , a different value is measured in each experimental realization ; even phenomena that are forbidden in a macroscopic systems become possible at a microscopic level , e.g. , entropy - decreasing trajectories @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the probability distributions of these thermodynamics quantities obey some deterministic laws @xcite .",
    "optically trapped particles @xcite have emerged as a powerful model system to address experimentally novel concepts in the context of statistical physics in a convenient way relying both on the presence of a natural noisy background and on a finely controllable deterministic optical force field @xcite . indeed , a colloidal particle , i.e. a microscopic particle suspended in a fluid , is set in constant movement by the presence of thermal fluctuations , which are responsible for its diffusion and introduce a well - defined noisy background .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to make use of optical forces to introduce deterministic perturbations acting on the particle in a controllable way .",
    "for example , optically trapped particles have been used to study experimentally many non - trivial , sometimes constructive , aspects of the presence of noise , e.g. , stochastic resonance @xcite , stochastic activation @xcite , brownian ratchets @xcite , or stochastic resonant damping @xcite .",
    "an implicit assumption in these studies is that the optical trap acts as a harmonic potential , i.e. the restoring optical force is proportional to the particle displacement from the trap center .",
    "this entails that the optical force field should be conservative , excluding the possibility of a rotational component .",
    "this is actually true to a great extent in the @xmath0-plane perpendicular to the beam propagation direction , at least for a standard optical trap generated by a gaussian beam .",
    "however , due to the presence of the scattering force , this has been shown not to be true in a plane parallel to the beam propagation , e.g. , @xmath1-plane @xcite . for most experimental situations",
    "the nonconservative effects are effectively negligible , becoming significant only when the particle is allowed to explore a large region of the optical field @xcite .",
    "this typically occurs for extremely low - power trapping , far away from the trapping regimes usually used in experiments , or for particles driven out - of - equilibrium .    in this article",
    ", we show paradigmatically how the determination of a thermodynamic quantity , namely the work , is affected by the presence of a rotational , i.e. nonconservative , force field .",
    "we measure the work performed by a fluid flow on three optically trapped colloidal particles of comparable dimension , but different refractive index . for a larger refractive index ,",
    "the rotational optical force field component increases and , therefore , introduces larger artifacts into the measured work distributions .",
    "the experimental setup consists of an optical tweezers build on a home - made optical microscope with a high - numerical - aperture water - immersion objective lens ( olympus , uplapo60xw3 , na=1.2 ) ; the optical trap is generated by a frequency and amplitude stabilized nd - yag laser ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 maximum output power , innolight mephisto)@xcite .",
    "we use colloidal spheres of comparable diameter , i.e. @xmath4 , of three different material  silica ( si ) , polystyrene ( ps ) and melamine ( me ) .",
    "the main parameters of the experimental setup and of the beads used in this experiment are reported in table [ table ] .",
    "the particles are diluted in distilled deionized water to a final concentration of a few particles/@xmath5 .",
    "the sample cell is made with a @xmath6-thick coverslip and a microscope slide , which are separated by a @xmath7-thick parafilm spacer and sealed with vacuum grease to prevent evaporation and contamination .",
    "such sample cell is mounted on a closed - loop piezoelectric stage ( physik instrumente pi-517.3cl ) , which allows movements with nanometer resolution .",
    "obviously , a movement of the stage in a given direction corresponds to a movement the optical trap focus in the opposite direction from the perspective of the trapped particle .",
    "the sample temperature is continuously monitored using a calibrated ntc thermistor positioned on the top surface of the microscope slide and remained constant within @xmath8 during each set of measurements .",
    "a colloidal sphere is trapped and positioned in the middle of the sample cell , i.e. far away from the surfaces to avoid spurious effects arising from diffusion gradients @xcite .",
    "its @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 coordinates ( figure [ fig1](a ) ) are monitored through the forward scattered light imaged at the back focal plane of the condenser lens on a ingaas quadrant photodiode ( qpd , hamamatsu g6849 ) @xcite . a digital oscilloscope ( tektronix tds5034b )",
    "is used for data - acquisition .",
    "the qpd - response is linear for displacements up to @xmath12 ( @xmath13 resolution , @xmath14 bandwidth ) .",
    "the conversion factor from voltage to distance is calibrated using the power spectral density ( psd ) method @xcite .    to minimize external noise ,",
    "the experimental setup is mounted on a passive vibration isolation optical table .",
    "moreover , the laser paths are kept as short as possible to avoid pointing fluctuations and the laser beam is enclosed in plastic pipes wherever possible .",

    "in particular the psds show a very flat plateau up to the minimum frequency measured which corresponds to a period of @xmath17 .",

    "i.e. @xmath33 , and @xmath22 is the radial stiffness of the optical trap , assumed to be harmonic . at @xmath34",
    "the stage starts moving at a speed @xmath35 along the @xmath9 coordinate ( figure [ fig1](b ) ) , producing an effective fluid flow and an effective force @xmath36 acting on the particle , where @xmath37 is the particle friction coefficient .",

    "as will be shown , a deviation from a harmonic trap , leads to deviations from such work distribution .",
    "thus , in the presence of nonconservative optical forces , we expect the experimental probability distribution function of the work to deviate from eq .",

    "the work performed on all particles is in good agreement with the theoretical expectation .",
    "however , for larger times only the data relative to the si particle keep on being in agreement , while deviations arise for the data on ps and me particles .",
    "in order to understand such disagreement , we consider the deviation of the optical force field from the harmonic one assumed in eq .",
    "[ eq : theo_work ] .",
    "indeed , in the case of optical trapping powers as small as the ones we employ , the optical force field can be better approximated allowing for a rotational component in the vertical plane @xcite .",
    "a generic force field can be characterized by measuring the auto - correlation and cross - correlation functions between the coordinates of the particle @xcite . in particular , here in order to characterize the rotational optical forces , we use the cross correlation difference between @xmath32 and @xmath11 @xcite @xmath55 \\frac{\\sinh \\left [   \\sqrt{| \\bar{\\tau}^{-2 } - \\epsilon^2 \\tau_{\\rho}^{-2 } | } \\tau \\right ] } { \\sqrt{| \\bar{\\tau}^{-2 } - \\epsilon^2 \\tau_{\\rho}^{-2 } | } } \\label{eq : ccf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 $ ] is the average relaxation time in the trap , @xmath57 the relaxation time along the @xmath11-direction , @xmath24 the stiffness along the @xmath11-direction and @xmath26 the relative contribution of the nonconservative force fields .",
    "@xmath58 is clear evidence that the contribution of the nonconservative force field component is effectively negligible .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "the experimental @xmath59 is presented for the case of a si ( blue ) , ps ( red ) and me ( green ) optically trapped brownian particle without fluid flow .",
    "while the rotational component is negligible for the case of a si particle , it becomes significant for the cases of ps and , even more , for the case of a me particle .",
    "summarizing , the rotational component appears to increase with the refractive index of the particle .",
    "the same results are obtained in the presence of a fluid flow .",
    "the presence of a larger rotational component of the force field appears to be in direct relation to the deterioration of the agreement between theory and experiments in the determination of the work done by the fluid flow on the brownian particle .",
    "this can be understood in a qualitative way . in the presence of a harmonic trapping potential , the particle movement along @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are independent .",
    "for example , assuming the particle to be at @xmath60 the protocol acts on the particle trajectory independently from the value of @xmath61 .",
    "however , if there is a rotational component of the force field , a particle will undergo the effect of both the protocol and the rotational force field , which , e.g. , may result in a longer displacement for @xmath62 and in a shorter one for @xmath63 .",
    "clearly , this effect becomes evident only for times long enough for the effect of the rotational component to be significant .",
    "this explains the widening of the experimental work distribution in the case of ps and me particles for long times ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .    in principle",
    ", the partial differential equation ruling the time evolution of the probability distribution function of the work could be obtained also in the presence of nonconservative forces following the procedure outlined in @xcite . however , while such an equation can be explicitly solved in the case of a harmonic potential , leading to eq .",
