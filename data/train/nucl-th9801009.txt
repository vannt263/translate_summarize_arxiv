    "the geometrical size and dynamical state of the hadronic phase space emission region , however , depends sensitively on the entire evolution of the collision .",
    "this motivates current attempts to reconstruct its spatial and dynamical state from the experimental hadron spectra and to use it as a starting point for a dynamical back extrapolation into the hot and dense intermediate stages  @xcite .",
    "two - particle correlations of identical particles which are sensitive to the space - time characteristics of the collision  @xcite , play a crucial role in this approach .",
    "the reconstruction program based on their analysis has very good prospects : due to the increasing event multiplicities and larger statistics of the cern sps lead beam program ( and the yet better quality data expected from relativistic heavy ion collider rhic at bnl ) , particle interferometric measurements start showing statistical errors on the few percent level .",
    "also , systematic errors are increasingly better understood .",
    "theoretical calculations should aim for a similar accuracy and control necessary approximations quantitatively .",
    "one uncontrolled approximation used so far in almost all particle interferometric calculations is to neglect for the particle momentum spectra of bose - einstein symmetrized @xmath0-particle states all multiparticle correlations which can not be written in terms of simpler pairwise ones .",

    "second , zajc has found  @xcite the first steps towards a calculational scheme brought into final form by pratt  @xcite : for model distributions , the @xmath0-particle spectra are given by a simple algorithm involving only two types of terms : @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in practice , this reduces the sums over all @xmath1 permutations , typical for the calculation of momentum spectra , to sums over all partitions of @xmath0 .    for both these approaches , there are first numerical calculations  @xcite and related analytical attempts  @xcite to control multiparticle effects to the one- and two - particle spectra , but a detailed study of their momentum dependence is missing , even for simple models",
    "this work aims at filling this gap , making quantitative statements about the extent to which the slope of the one - particle spectrum and the relative momentum dependence of the two - particle correlations are modified due to multiparticle symmetrization effects .",

    "our work is organized as follows : section  [ sec2 ] shortly sets up and illustrates the general formalism via which particle momentum spectra are calculated from an @xmath0-particle state . in section  [ sec3 ] , we discuss the properties of gaussian wavepackets which we choose for the single - particle states @xmath19 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] contains the main results .",
    "it gives a complete qualitative and quantitative analysis of multiparticle contributions to the one- and two - particle spectra for a boson emitting source of gaussian phase space distribution .",
    "in section  [ sec5 ] , we discuss the implications of this model study for an algorithm which calculates the hanbury brown twiss ( hbt ) radius parameters and momentum spectra for an arbitrary distribution of emission points .",
    "results and related conceptual questions are summarized and discussed in the conclusions .",

    "we use the normalization  @xcite @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the total pion cross section .",

    "setting these cross sections proportional to the one- and two - particle spectra @xmath226 , @xmath227 , the two - particle correlator reads @xmath228 the simplest way to make further progress is to assume that the approximation ( [ 4.20 ] ) for @xmath7 is valid for all @xmath229 .",

    "the offset @xmath158 in ( [ 4.31b ] ) measures the system size from which particles are emitted .",

    "this ensures that @xmath244 .",
    "we finally note that irrespective of the offset @xmath245 of the normalization , the correlator in ( [ 4.30 ] ) changes by a factor @xmath214 between the limits @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",

    "depending on the model , this may affect the intercept of @xmath223 at @xmath246 .",
    "indeed , a decrease of the intercept with increasing event multiplicities was reported in recent model studies  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the present study , these models however do not work with fixed event multiplicities and show a significantly different physics , including pion lasing effects  @xcite .",
    "we only conclude from the present study that multiparticle symmetrization effect do not lead automatically to a strong decrease of the intercept parameter .",
    "we now explain why the offset @xmath243 of the normalization of @xmath223 is not obtained in conventional calculations where multiparticle symmetrization effects are neglected . for the wavepackets introduced in section  [ sec3 ] , the wavepacket overlap functions @xmath38 in ( [ 3.4 ] ) shows a gaussian decrease with the phase space distance @xmath248 . in general",

    "the term @xmath254 in ( [ 4.13 ] ) then insures that @xmath255 . according to ( [ 4.32 ] ) , this contradicts the statement @xmath256 . the origin of this difficulty can be traced back to the integral @xmath257 which should vanish according to ( [ 4.35 ] ) .",
    "the pair approximation does not treat the integral @xmath258 and the integrand of ( [ 4.37 ] ) on an equal footing .",

    "it is this inconsistency which leads to a correlator @xmath240 everywhere .",

    "when all multiparticle effects are neglected , we obtain from ( [ 4.2b ] ) the well - known result  @xcite @xmath262 the other , equally unrealistic limiting case is that multiparticle contributions dominate completely .",
    "the resulting two - particle correlator is given in ( [ 4.30 ] ) and the corresponding hbt - radius parameter reads @xmath263 the difference between these two expressions is significant . for a discussion of the main qualitative and quantitative effects , we now focus on the parameter region @xmath264 relevant for relativistic heavy ion collisions .",

    "the effect may be significantly stronger .",
    "in general , the degree to which multiparticle effects modify hbt radius parameters depends significantly on the phase space density of emission points .",
    "in this section , we shortly discuss how the calculation of multiparticle correlation effects can be extended to more realistic source distributions where the analytical techniques used in section  [ sec4 ] are not applicable .",

    "this seems to be sufficient for all practical purposes , since according to our model study , the weights @xmath130 , @xmath152 for @xmath272 are negligible for realistic phase space densities @xmath159 .    here",

    "we interprete these points as the centers of gaussian single - particle wavepackets , i.e. , @xmath273 an arbitrary distribution of @xmath0 discrete phase space points is the most general ` source model ' in the present framework .",
    "we first discuss algorithms which allow for the calculation of the two - particle correlator from a set @xmath85 . then we comment on applications of these algorithms to event generators .",

    "the one - particle spectrum @xmath283 and the 2-particle correlation obtained in this way have been discussed already extensively in  @xcite .",
    "they can be rewritten in terms of the single - particle probabilities @xmath284 of ( [ 3.3b ] ) ,    [ 5.5 ] @xmath285    the number of numerical operations needed to calculate this correlator grows linearly with the multiplicity @xmath0 rather than quadratic as in ( [ 5.2 ] ) and this makes it particularly suitable for a numerical algorithm . at",
    "given observed momenta @xmath72 , @xmath73 , one calculates for each event the one particle probabilities @xmath286 according to ( [ 3.3b ] ) and performes the sums in ( [ 5.5 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath286 are continuous in the measured momentum , and hence the obtained correlator is a continuous function of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , i.e. , no binning is required . at high multiplicities , when the factors @xmath280 are negligible , the correlator ( [ 5.5 ] ) can be rewritten as a fourier transform over an emission function @xmath287 , thereby regaining the well - known starting point of most model studies , ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for further details )    [ 5.6 ] @xmath288    the above discussion shows , that in the pair approximation , a numerical algorithm for the calculation of one- and two - particle spectra can be based on a discrete version of the first order pratt terms @xmath210 . here , we propose to extend this approach to take multiparticle correlations into account by calculating    [ 5.7 ] @xmath289    the sums in these expressions run over all sets of @xmath56 out of @xmath0 integers and over all @xmath290 permutations of each set .",
    "this implies that for event multiplicities in the hundreds , only terms up to order @xmath291 can be calculated in a reasonable amount of cpu time . a tentative strategy for calculating multiparticle correlation effects on the basis of ( [ 5.7 ] )",

    "fit gaussians in @xmath72 and @xmath73 to the momentum - dependent pratt terms @xmath178 .",

    "this scheme draws on the experience gained from the study of the gaussian toy model in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "we expect that it allows to estimate multiparticle contributions for model distributions @xmath85 .",
    "many event generators for the simulation of heavy ion collisions have been developed in recent years  @xcite , and irrespective of the large variety of physical inputs present in their codes , the typical output of their event simulation contains for each event a set @xmath8 of @xmath0 phase space points @xmath9 which one associates to the final state particles produced .",
    "however , a choice of interpretation is involved in comparing an event generator output @xmath18 to experimental data .",
    "usually , the measured one - particle spectra are compared directly to the binned momenta @xmath39 , i.e. one implicitly interprets the simulated phase space points @xmath296 as defining momentum eigenstates , which a fortiori carry no space - time information . for the calculation of two - particle correlations , this interpretation is not suitable , it leads to a sharp @xmath297-like correlator  @xcite .",
    "also , a classical interpretation of @xmath296 which takes both @xmath40 and @xmath39 as `` sharp '' information , is problematic : ignoring the correct quantum mechanical localization leads to quantitatively and qualitatively unreliable results  @xcite . on the other hand , including a quantum mechanical localization width @xmath86 , one changes both the one- and two - particle spectrum by a prescription which has no dynamical foundation .",
    "the origin of these difficulties in finding a consistent interpretation of the event generator output @xmath18 is well - known , see e.g.  @xcite : quantum mechanical processes require a description in terms of amplitudes , while event simulations are formulated in a probabilistic setting .",
    "bose - einstein correlations occur by symmetrizing the production amplitudes of identical particles and are hence not encoded for in event generators .",
    "the mere fact that the simulated output is a discrete phase space distribution of emission points without identical multiparticle correlations ( rather than a set of detected momenta which includes all multiparticle correlations and hence all space - time information available from the measurement ) , is the very consequence of using a probabilistic language . in practice , this forces one to take recourse to an algorithm which associates _ a posteriori _ bose - einstein weights with the simulated phase space distribution @xmath8 , rather than obtaining these correlations from the dynamical propagation of properly ( anti)-symmetrized n - particle states .",
    "this a posteriori modification of an incomplete quantum - dynamical evolution creates the interpretational problems of the output @xmath18 .",
    "phenomenologically motivated numerical simulations of heavy ion collisions have remarkable success despite these fundamental problems .",
    "it is of some interest to confront them with experimental two - particle correlations , since this provides a test of their spatio - temporal ( rather than only their momentum - dependent ) properties .",
    "we expect that the algorithms discussed in section [ sec5a ] are useful in such comparisons .",
    "the zajc - pratt algorithm provides a simple technique for the calculation of multiparticle symmetrization effects in one- and two - particle spectra .",
    "based on this algorithm , we have studied to what extent multiparticle correlations steepen the slope of the one - particle and broaden the width of the two - particle spectrum .",
    "the scale of both effects depends sensitively on the particle phase space density @xmath159 in the emission region .",
    "multiparticle correlations contribute a fraction @xmath298 to the one - particle spectrum and a fraction @xmath299 to the two - particle spectrum .",
    "also , the @xmath56-dependence of higher order pratt terms , i.e. , the extent to which the momentum dependence of multiparticle contributions @xmath7 changes with increasing order @xmath56 , plays an important role . in a gaussian source model with instantaneous emission and moderate particle phase space densities , the slope parameter @xmath300 of the one - particle spectrum changes by up to 20 mev , and the change in the hbt radius parameters is of the order of 10 percent , if multiparticle effects are neglected .    for the reconstruction program advocated in @xcite ,",
    "our results indicate that neglecting multiparticle effects , one underestimates the source temperature significantly and one overestimates the energy density by up to 30 % . here , the caveat is however that our calculation does not include multiparticle final state coulomb interactions .",
    "bose - einstein and coulomb effects typically arise on the same scale and compensate each other at least to some extent .",
    "this may significantly reduce the effect of multiparticle correlations in the measured @xmath301 and @xmath302 spectra on which most of the phenomenological analysis is based currently .",
    "it will hence be very interesting to compare the slopes of the one - particle spectra of charged and neutral pions  @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the above heuristic ideas , one may expect the slope of the @xmath303-spectrum to be somewhat steeper , since multiparticle coulomb interactions can not compensate for the multiparticle bose - einstein symmetrization effects .",
    "our analysis of multiparticle effects has also shed new light on a recent discussion about the normalization of the two - particle correlator . defining the correlator via ( [ 4.26 ] )",
    ", it is normalized for large relative momenta @xmath73 to @xmath243 , and not to unity .",
    "the importance of this result was already discussed in section  [ sec4d1 ] : the normalization ( [ 4.31b ] ) corrects the result of the commonly used pair approximation and leads to bose - einstein unit weights which conserve event probabilities .",
    "we close by embedding the present work into a wider perspective : many aspects of the dynamical evolution of relativistic heavy ion collisions are mesoscopic , and this makes it very difficult to decide whether certain physical observables have a known conventional interpretation or are indicative of the new in medium properties which the current experimental programs at cern and rhic aim for .",
    "the physics of final state hadrons however , though being mesoscopic and hence difficult to treat , is known in principle .",
    "it allows hence for a detailed quantitative description on the basis of present day knowledge . in a second step",

    "<S> multiparticle effects steepen the slope of the one - particle spectrum for realistic particle phase space densities by up to 20 mev , and they broaden the relative momentum dependence of the two - particle correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these modifications and their consequences in quantitative detail . </S>",
    "<S> also , we explain how multiparticle effects modify the normalization of the two - particle correlator . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting normalization conserves event probabilities , which is not the case for the commonly used pair approximation . finally , we propose a new method of calculating bose - einstein weights from the output of event generators , taking multiparticle correlations into account .    </S>",
