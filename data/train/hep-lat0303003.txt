    "one of the challenges in the study of strong interactions is to compute physical quantities with in the framework of qcd with controlled errors .",
    "although lattice qcd can in principle accomplish this task , most known algorithms encounter problems related to critical slowing down as the quark masses become small @xcite .",
    "it is impossible to compute quantities reliably for realistic `` up '' and `` down '' quark masses with current algorithms . at present ,",
    "one usually computes quantities at an unphysically large quark mass and uses chiral extrapolations to obtain the final answer @xcite . for sufficiently light quarks",
    "this is a reliable technique .",
    "however , for the quark masses that are currently used , such extrapolations are questionable . furthermore , most calculations with light quarks are obtained in the quenched approximation where the internal dynamics of fermions are ignored .",
    "there also exist some interesting quantities which can not be computed when the quarks are heavy .",
    "for example , in the real world the rho meson can decay into two pions .",
    "unfortunately , for most values of the quark masses that are currently used , this decay is forbidden .",
    "if lattice simulations were possible with sufficiently light quarks , the resonant nature of the rho meson can be studied with lattice techniques @xcite .",
    "there are two main problems in constructing efficient algorithms for lattice",
    "the first is that the fundamental variables , namely the quark and gluon fields , are unphysical since they are gauge dependent .",
    "secondly , the quarks are fermions and due to the pauli principle introduce sign problems which are typically very difficult to solve . fortunately , with a good lattice fermion formulation and at zero baryon chemical potential , the second problem can be avoided .",
    "the quarks can be integrated out and their effects can be encoded in terms of a determinant which is a positive non - local function of the gauge fields . however ,",
    "one is still left with the problem of updating the unphysical gauge fields .",
    "previous experience suggests that in order to find an efficient algorithm it is often useful to understand and isolate the physical modes of the theory .",
    "unfortunately , for gauge theories , especially with the non - local fermion determinant this problem looks formidable .",
    "interestingly , there is a limit of lattice qcd with staggered fermions where most of the above mentioned complications can be eliminated .",
    "this is the so called strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "although this limit has the worst lattice artifacts and could describe the wrong phase , the resulting theory is still an interesting toy model for qcd .",
    "it contains the physics of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking . in the chiral limit one finds massless goldstone bosons in addition to other massive mesonic and baryonic excitations .",
    "the strong coupling theory can be solved analytically only in the large @xmath4 @xcite and large @xmath5 @xcite limits .",
    "one needs a numerical approach to study it without these approximations .",
    "the luxury of the strong coupling limit is that it is possible to integrate out the gauge fields analytically and write the problem entirely in terms of gauge invariant objects .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that with @xmath0 gauge fields the strong coupling model with staggered fermions is equivalent to a system of monomers and dimers with positive boltzmann weights . later",
    "a monomer - dimer - polymer representation was discovered for @xmath6 gauge fields @xcite .",
    "is it possible to use these simplified representations that arise at strong couplings to construct an efficient algorithm in the chiral limit ?",
    "in @xcite simple local algorithms were proposed . however , as far as we know , all these algorithms break down in the chiral limit .",
    "in fact there is evidence that the proposed algorithms may also have other problems away from the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "recently , a cluster based algorithm was proposed to update the monomer - dimer system which works very well in the chiral limit on small lattices @xcite .",
    "however , even this algorithm becomes inefficient for large lattice sizes due to long auto correlation times .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new and efficient algorithm to study the chiral limit of strongly coupled @xmath0 gauge theories with staggered fermions in any dimension .",
    "it should be possible to extend it to @xmath7 gauge theories with minor modifications .",
    "we then use this algorithm to study questions related to chiral symmetry in two , three and four dimensions .",
    "our study shows that this algorithm has the potential to address many unresolved questions about the chiral limit of gauge theories at least in the strong coupling limit .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the monomer - dimer representation of strong coupling @xmath0 gauge theories with staggered fermions and discuss the consequences of chiral symmetry in this language .",
    "we then show how a finite size scaling formula for the chiral susceptibility can be used to compute the chiral condensate from finite volume lattice calculations in the chiral limit .",
    "in section 3 we construct a new type of cluster algorithm , which we call the `` directed path '' cluster algorithm , to update the monomer - dimer model .",
    "we show that it obeys detailed balance and is ergodic .",
    "section 4 contains explicit expressions that can be used to compute observables like the condensate and the susceptibility with the new algorithm . in section 5",
    "we test the algorithm by comparing exact results on small lattices with the results obtained using the algorithm",
    ". we also present an exact large l result on the 2 x l lattice and compare with the result from the algorithm . in section 6",
    "we discuss the performance of the new algorithm and compare it with an earlier algorithm proposed in @xcite .",
    "we argue why the results obtained earlier were incorrect at large volumes . in this context",
    "we also briefly study the autocorrelations of the new algorithm . in section 7 , using our new algorithm we study the issue of chiral symmetry breaking in two , three and four dimensions for different values of @xmath4 .",

    "is very difficult to compute since it is a noisy observable .",
    "our new approach on the other hand allows us to measure it very accurately even in large volumes .",
    "although we have written eq.([sus ] ) for a general @xmath5 , the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem @xcite forbids a phase with broken chiral symmetry in two dimensions . in that case only the critical or the massive phases are possible .",
    "the constraints imposed by eq.([constraint ] ) make it difficult to design algorithms for the monomer - dimer systems near the chiral limit . when @xmath47 , configurations with monomers have vanishing weight in the partition function and local algorithms find it difficult to update the remaining constrained dimer configurations efficiently .",
    "cluster algorithms on the other hand can deal with constraints very efficiently .",
    "an analogue of this problem in a well - known setting is the following : consider for example a quantum spin - half system where the number of `` up '' spins and `` down '' spins are individually conserved .",
    "a typical configuration of such a system is represented by a world - line of spins . while local algorithms find it extremely difficult to update such configurations , the loop cluster algorithm is very efficient @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we discovered that the monomer - dimer model can also be rewritten in terms of loop variables and found them to be convenient tools to update the system when @xmath47 .",
    "unfortunately , the metropolis algorithm that was designed to update the loops turns out to be inefficient .",
    "certain large clusters can only be updated with small probabilities and the algorithm develops long autocorrelation times as the lattice size grows .",
    "this problem is similar to the problem encountered in an anti - ferromagnetic quantum spin - half model in the presence of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the loop cluster algorithm which works efficiently in updating the model in the absence of magnetic fields , becomes exponentially inefficient in their presence .",
    "again , some large clusters get frozen and can not be updated .",
    "recently , a new algorithm called the `` directed loop '' algorithm was proposed for the antiferromagnetic model in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is extremely efficient even for large magnetic fields .",
    "here we extend this algorithm to study strong coupling gauge theories . in this section",
    "we construct a `` directed path cluster algorithm '' to update the monomer - dimer configurations .",
    "our construction is such that the algorithm does not change the number of monomers in a given configuration .",
    "hence , it is only ergodic in the chiral limit where the number of monomers is strictly zero and does not change . when @xmath63 it is necessary to supplement it with an update that changes the number of monomers . for this we can use any local algorithm .",
    "we will briefly review one such algorithm at the end of this section for completeness .",
    "the basic idea behind our algorithm is to create a monomer at a site .",
    "however , in order to do this while satisfying the constraints it is necessary to remove a dimer from one of the links connected to the site and create another monomer on the other end of the bond .",
    "this neighboring monomer is then moved along a directed path , while satisfying detailed balance at each step until it encounters a partner such that both monomers can be removed by creating a dimer .",
    "thus , at the end of a directed path update , the number of monomers remains fixed .",
    "it is interesting to note that at every stage , between the start and the end of the path , we sample configurations that are relevant in the computation of two point correlation function of monomers . hence , these intermediate configurations can be used to measure certain observables .",
    "we will discuss this feature of the algorithm in the next section .    in order to explain the algorithm better and",
    "show that it obeys detailed balance it is useful to develop some notation .",
    "we begin by dividing the sites of the lattice into _ active _ and _ passive _ sites .",
    "if the first site we pick during the update is even then all even sites are defined to be active and all odd sites become passive . on the other hand",
    "if the first site happens to be odd , then all odd sites become active and even sites become passive . each active ( passive ) site",
    "is associated with an active ( passive ) block which includes the site with the information @xmath64 about number of monomers on it and the @xmath65 bonds connected to the site with the information @xmath66 of their dimer content . due to the constraint eq.([constraint ] ) we must have @xmath67 we will represent the block symbolically by @xmath68 .",
    "its boltzmann weight is defined to be @xmath69 if it is an active block and @xmath70 if it is a passive block .",
    "we have dropped factors of the mass because our objective is not to change the total number of monomers in the configuration .",
    "it is easy to verify that the product of the weights of all the active and passive blocks in a configuration is equal to the boltzmann weight of the configuration up to some power of the mass .",
    "a directed path update begins by entering a site at random . by definition",
    "that site belongs to an active block and the path enters the block through the site .",
    "given an in - coming path the algorithm works on finding an outgoing path with a probability that satisfies detailed balance .",
    "the out - going path can either be one of the @xmath65 bonds or the starting site itself . as we will see",
    "shortly , the correct probability to choose the outgoing path to be the starting site is @xmath71 and the probability to choose the bond in the @xmath72 direction is @xmath73 if the out - going path is chosen to be the starting site then the directed path update already ends .",
    "the configuration is returned without being updated .",
    "otherwise the path goes out through the chosen bond .",
    "as it leaves the active block it updates it by adding a monomer on the incoming site and then removing the monomer again if the path terminates immediately , or reducing the bond number on the outgoing link if the path continues .",
    "let us invent a notation to describe this process .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath74 next to a bond or a site to indicate in - coming path into the block and use @xmath75 to indicate the out - going path . for example @xmath76",
    "means that the path came into the block through the site and left the block through the @xmath77 bond .",
    "when the path leaves the ( active ) block , the updated block is given by @xmath78 .",
    "figure [ block ] shows a typical directed path through a three dimensional block .    0.2 in     _ a typical directed path passing through a 3d block .",
    "the path enters the block through the @xmath79 bond and leaves through the @xmath43 bond . the block and the path",
    "are represented by @xmath80 . _ ]    -0.2 in    when the path leaves an active block through a bond it enters the neighboring passive block through the same bond .",
    "it is then forced to leave through one of the remaining @xmath81 bonds with probabilities given below . since now the value of @xmath44 is important , we distinguish two cases : @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ". if the incoming path is through the @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) bond , the outgoing path can either be the @xmath86 ( @xmath43 ) bond or any one of @xmath87 bonds .",
    "the probability to pick @xmath85 ( @xmath88 ) is given by @xmath89 while the probability to choose any one of the @xmath87 is given by @xmath90 however , if the path comes into the block through one of the @xmath87 bonds , then the outgoing path is chosen to be the @xmath88 or @xmath85 bond with probability @xmath91 and is chosen to be one of the @xmath92 bonds with probability @xmath93 as the path leaves a passive block , the block itself is updated by lowering the dimer number on the incoming bond and raising the dimer number on the outgoing bond .",
    "we note that in eqs.([p3]-[p6 ] ) the probability definitions for @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be extended to the range @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the requirement of detailed balance does not determine all the probabilities uniquely .    when the path leaves the passive block it enters the adjacent active block through an in - coming bond .",
    "in this case it can now leave through one of the remaining @xmath81 bonds or the site .",
    "given the in - coming path to be through the bond @xmath98 , the probability to choose the bond @xmath13 as the out - going path is @xmath99 and the probability to choose the site as the outgoing path is @xmath100 if the path leaves through a bond then it continues into another passive block and goes forward as already discussed above .",
    "however , if it exits through the site then the path ends . in either case",
    "the active block is again updated by increasing the dimer content of the incoming bond by one and decreasing the dimer content of the outgoing bond or decreasing the monomer content of the outgoing site by one .",
    "thus , we see that the algorithm always enters and exits through the sites of active blocks .",
    "it increases the monomer number on the incoming site by one and decreases the monomer number at the exiting site by one , and thus preserving the total number of monomers .",
    "of course , the site at which the directed path enters may or may not be the site in which it leaves , although for @xmath47 these two sites are forced to be the same since the weight of a configuration which contains monomers vanishes .",
    "thus , in the chiral limit , the directed path is always a closed loop .",
    "an important difference between active and passive blocks is that the paths always enter and leave a passive block through a bond .",
    "hence the monomer content of sites belonging to passive blocks never change during a single directed path update .",
    "the paths always enter a passive block on a bond which has at least one dimer on it .",
    "it remains to be shown that eqs.([p1]-[p8 ] ) satisfy detailed balance with respect to the boltzmann weights given in eqs .",
    "( [ actw ] ) and ( [ pasw ] ) .",
    "first consider the active block represented by @xmath101 with the in - coming path specified to be the bond @xmath98 .",
    "the probability to choose the bond @xmath13 as the out - going bond is given by eq.([p7 ] ) .",
    "after the update the active block is changed to @xmath102 . in order to prove detailed balance one is interested in the reverse process .",
    "for this , one should start with the configuration @xmath103 , where now the in - coming path is the bond @xmath13 , and figure out the probability of choosing @xmath98 as the out - going path .",
    "this turns out to be @xmath104 we see that these probabilities and the weights given in eq.([actw ] ) satisfy detailed balance : @xmath105 in the above detailed balance equation we have only considered factors of the boltzmann weight that change during the update .    in the case of the passive block it is again easy to show detailed balance .",
    "for example consider the case when the incoming path is through the @xmath106 bond and the outgoing bond is through the @xmath87 bond .",
    "we can represent this path by @xmath107 .",
    "after the update the new weight of the block is equal to the old weight divided by @xmath44 .",
    "the reverse process , starting from the updated block looks like @xmath108 .",
    "the detailed balance requires @xmath109 which is indeed true when we use eqs.([p4],[p5 ] ) . using a similar method",
    "one can show that other choices of incoming and outgoing paths on both active and passive blocks obey detailed balance locally at each update .",
    "there is one exception which we discuss below .",
    "consider the case when the in - coming path is a site and the out - going path is a bond and its reverse process .",
    "we represent this case by @xmath110 , for which the probability is given by eq.([p2 ] ) .",
    "the reverse process on the other hand can be represented by @xmath111 , which has the probability @xmath112 we now see that the detailed balance is not quite satisfied locally , since @xmath113 there is a extra factor @xmath114 that remains uncanceled while we go from the site to the bond .",
    "however , since the complete `` directed path '' update starts and ends on an active site , this extra factor must appear in each direction after a complete path update .",
    "this then guarantees that the complete forward and reverse directed paths indeed satisfy detailed balance .",
    "before we end this section let us briefly comment on the ergodicity of the algorithm .",
    "when @xmath47 the `` directed path '' update is ergodic by itself . in order to see this , let us assume that @xmath115 .",
    "in this case , any configuration can be transformed into any other configuration by a series of disconnected directed loop updates .",
    "the loops themselves can be identified by superimposing one configuration over the other .",
    "all dimers that differ in the two configurations connect the sites into disconnected loops .",
    "clearly , there is a non - zero probability for performing this specific series of directed loop updates and hence to go from any configuration to any other . for @xmath116 ,",
    "one can easily extend this argument and prove ergodicity .",
    "since the directed path algorithm does not change the number of monomers , we need to supplement it with another algorithm that can change the number of monomers in a configuration when @xmath28 is nonzero , in order to make the algorithm ergodic .",
    "many options are available .",
    "one can choose a local algorithm based on either a metropolis or a heat bath update .",
    "in the case of a metropolis update for example , a simple algorithm would be to pick a bond at random and propose to either break the dimer into two monomers or create a dimer from two monomers .",
    "this proposal is then accepted with a metropolis accept reject step .",
    "we find that this combined algorithm is reasonably efficient .",
    "we are currently exploring a more natural extension of the directed path algorithm to the massive case which avoids the additional local metropolis step .",
    "this will be published elsewhere .",
    "let us for the moment assume that the directed path algorithm discussed above can efficiently sample configurations that contribute to the partition function . if these configurations also contribute to an observable , then we may be able to compute the average of the observable efficiently .",
    "however , for this to be true , the observable must get all the contribution only from the ensemble of configurations sampled by the algorithm and the value of the observable must not fluctuate much in this ensemble .",
    "observables which satisfy these properties will be referred to as `` diagonal '' observables . for example",
    "observables like dimer - dimer correlations and spatial winding numbers associated to the global @xmath48 chiral symmetry are diagonal observables . when @xmath28 is not very small , monomer correlations can also be treated as diagonal observables . on the other hand",
    "when @xmath47 , observables involving monomers do not fall in this category ; such observables get contributions from configurations with monomers , while the algorithm only produces zero - monomer configurations . in other words",
    "the configurations that are important to the partition function are not useful to measure observables .",
    "such observables are difficult to compute and will be referred to as `` non - diagonal '' observables .",
    "the chiral condensate and the chiral susceptibility are two interesting examples of such observables",
    ". we will argue below that the directed path algorithm offers an efficient method to compute them .    from the discussion in the previous section",
    "we know that a directed path update starts on an active site , goes through an alternate series of both passive and active sites and ends on an active site .",
    "it is important to recognize that between the start and the end of each update we sample a configuration with exactly two additional monomers every time we visit a passive site ; one monomer is located at the starting active site and the other at the visited passive site .",
    "these intermediate configurations can be used to compute monomer correlations . to write down explicit relations we introduce an integer function @xmath117 for each directed path update where @xmath118 are lattice sites .",
    "this function is defined as follows : before we start the directed path update we set @xmath119 for all values of @xmath118 ; we then add one to @xmath117 if the directed path update starts on the active site @xmath120 and every time it visits the passive site @xmath15 . now consider a monomer - dimer configuration with @xmath121 monomers located at @xmath122 .",
    "for this configuration we can define a one point function and a two point function as follows : @xmath123 \\label{corrobs2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is possible to show that @xmath124 @xmath125 in appendix [ obsder ] we give a brief derivation of these results .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ optcorr ] ) and ( [ tptcorr ] ) one finds @xmath126 and @xmath127 where we have used @xmath128 to denote the total number of monomers in the configuration . in eqs .",
    "( [ optcorr]-[susc ] ) the average on the right hand side is taken over the ensemble of configurations generated in the directed path algorithm .",
    "as the derivation in the appendix shows , some additional work is necessary to derive expressions for the non - diagonal observables in the directed path algorithm .",
    "however , it is usually possible to find expressions for most observables .",
    "in fact similar expressions have been obtained in the context of other cluster algorithms @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will demonstrate the correctness of the relations ( [ cc ] ) and ( [ susc ] ) by comparing the results obtained using them with exact calculations to a high accuracy .",

    "is given by @xmath213 and the probability to choose one of the @xmath87 bond by @xmath214 .",
    "3 .   once we pick the bond we increase the dimer content of that link by one and go to the adjoint active block .",
