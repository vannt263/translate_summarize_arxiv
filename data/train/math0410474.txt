    "the last few decades has seen a surge of activity in the study of finite volume hyperbolic manifolds  that is , complete riemannian @xmath2-manifolds of constant sectional curvature @xmath1 .",
    "not surprisingly for geometrical objects , volume has been , and continues to be , the most important invariant for understanding their sociology .",
    "the possible volumes in a fixed dimension forms a well - ordered subset of @xmath3 , indeed a discrete subset except in @xmath4-dimensions ( where the orientable manifolds at least have ordinal type @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus it is a natural problem with a long history to construct examples of manifolds with minimal volume in a given dimension .    in @xmath6-dimensions",
    "the solution is classical , with the minimum volume in the compact orientable case achieved by a genus @xmath6 surface , and in the non - compact orientable case by a once - punctured torus or thrice - punctured sphere ( the identities of the manifolds are of course also known in the non - orientable case ) . in @xmath4-dimensions",
    "the compact orientable case remains an open problem with the matveev - fomenko - weeks manifold @xcite obtained via @xmath7-dehn surgery on the the sister of the figure - eight knot complement conjecturally the smallest . amongst the non - compact orientable",
    "@xmath4-manifolds the figure - eight knot complement realizes the minimum volume @xcite and the gieseking manifold ( obtained by identifying the sides of a regular hyperbolic tetrahedron as in @xcite ) does so for the non - orientable ones @xcite .",
    "one could also add `` arithmetic '' to our list of adjectives and so have eight optimization problems to play with ( so that the matveev - fomenko - weeks manifold is known to be the minimum volume orientable , arithmetic compact @xmath4-manifold , see @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath8 the picture is murkier , although in even dimensions we have recourse to the gauss - bonnet theorem , so that in particular the minimal volume a @xmath9-dimensional hyperbolic manifold could possibly have is when the euler characteristic @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 .",
    "the first examples of non - compact @xmath12-manifolds with @xmath13 were constructed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . the compact case remains a difficult unsolved problem , although if we restrict to arithmetic manifolds , then it is known [ 2,8 ] that a minimal volume arithmetic compact orientable 4-manifold @xmath14 has @xmath15 and @xmath14 is isometric to the orbit space of a torsion - free subgroup of the hyperbolic coxeter group @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the smallest compact hyperbolic @xmath12-manifold currently known to exist has @xmath17 and is constructed in @xcite .",
    "manifolds of very small volume have been constructed in @xmath18-dimensions @xcite , but the smallest volume @xmath0-dimensional example hitherto known has @xmath19 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we announce the discovery of a number of non - compact non - orientable hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds with euler characteristic @xmath20 .",
    "the method of construction is classical in that the manifolds are obtained by identifying the sides of a @xmath0-dimensional hyperbolic coxeter polytope .",

    "call @xmath21 a coxeter polytope if the dihedral angle subtended by two intersecting @xmath23-dimensional sides is @xmath24 for some integer @xmath25 . when @xmath26 or the euclidean space @xmath27 , such polyhedra have been completely classified @xcite , but in the hyperbolic space @xmath28 , a complete classification remains a difficult problem ( see for example @xcite and the references there ) .",
    "if @xmath29 is the group generated by reflections in the @xmath23-dimensional sides of @xmath21 , then @xmath29 is a discrete cofinite subgroup of the lie group @xmath30 , and every discrete cofinite reflection group in @xmath30 arises in this way from some coxeter polytope , which is uniquely defined up to isometry .",
    "the coxeter symbol for @xmath21 ( or @xmath29 ) has nodes indexed by the @xmath23-dimensional sides , and an edge labeled @xmath31 joining the nodes corresponding to sides that intersect with angle @xmath24 ( label the edge joining the nodes of non - intersecting sides by @xmath32 ) . in practice the labels @xmath6 and @xmath4 occur often , so that edges so labeled are respectively removed or left unlabeled .",

    "vinberg and kaplinskaja showed @xcite that the subgroup @xmath41 of @xmath40 generated by reflections in positive norm vectors has finite index if and only if @xmath42 , thus yielding a family of cofinite reflection groups and corresponding finite volume coxeter polytopes in the hyperbolic spaces @xmath28 for @xmath43 .",

    "borcherds @xcite showed that the ( non self - dual ) even sublattice of @xmath44 also acts cofinitely , yielding the highest dimensional example known of a coxeter group acting cofinitely on hyperbolic space .",
    "when @xmath45 the group @xmath46 has coxeter symbol , @xmath47 with @xmath48 nodes and @xmath21 a non - compact , finite volume @xmath2-simplex @xmath49 ( when @xmath50 , the polytope @xmath21 has a more complicated structure ) .",
    "let @xmath51 be the vertex of @xmath49 opposite the side @xmath52 marked on the symbol , and let @xmath53 be the stabilizer in @xmath29 of this vertex .",
    "this stabilizer is also a reflection group with symbol as shown , and is finite for @xmath54 ( being the weyl group of type @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively ) and infinite for @xmath57 ( when it is the affine weyl group of type @xmath58 ) .",
    "let @xmath59 a convex polytope obtained by gluing @xmath60 copies of the simplex @xmath49 together .",

    ", @xmath61 is an all right - angled coxeter polytope : its sides meet with dihedral angle @xmath63 or are disjoint .",
    "this follows immediately from the observation that the sides of @xmath61 arise from the @xmath53-images of the side of @xmath49 opposite @xmath51 , and this side intersects the other sides of @xmath49 in dihedral angles @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "vinberg has conjectured that @xmath65 is the highest dimension in which finite volume all - right angled polytopes exist in hyperbolic space .",

    "when @xmath2 is even , we have by @xcite and @xcite , @xmath69 with @xmath70 the @xmath71-th bernoulli number and with the plus sign if @xmath72 and the minus sign otherwise .    alternatively ( when @xmath2 is even ) , we have recourse to the gauss - bonnet theorem , so that @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the euler characteristic of the coxeter group @xmath29 and @xmath75 .",
    "the euler characteristic of coxeter groups can be easily computed from their symbol ( see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",

    "the coxeter symbol for @xmath61 has a nice description in terms of finite reflection groups .",
    "if @xmath80 is the vertex of @xmath49 opposite the side @xmath81 , let @xmath82 be the pointwise stabilizer of @xmath83 : the elements thus stabilize the edge @xmath84 of @xmath49 joining @xmath51 and @xmath80 .",
    "now consider the cayley graph @xmath85 for @xmath53 with respect to the generating reflections in the sides of the symbol for @xmath53 .",
    "thus , @xmath85 has vertices in one to one correspondence with the elements of @xmath53 and for each generating reflection @xmath86 , an undirected edge labeled @xmath86 connecting vertices @xmath87 and @xmath88 if and only if @xmath89 in @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , @xmath85 has @xmath90 labeled edges corresponding to the reflection in @xmath81 .",
    "removing these @xmath90-edges decomposes @xmath85 into components , each of which is a copy of the cayley graph @xmath91 for @xmath82 , with respect to the generating reflections .",
    "take as the nodes of the symbol for @xmath61 these connected components .",
    "if two components have an @xmath90-labeled edge running between any two of their vertices in @xmath85 , then leave the corresponding nodes unconnected , otherwise , connect them by an edge labeled @xmath32 .",

    "we position @xmath99 in @xmath97 so that 6 of its sides are bounded by the 6 coordinate hyperplanes @xmath101 for @xmath102 and these 6 sides intersect at the center @xmath103 of @xmath97 .",
