    "the _ rosat _  observatory provided us with at least seven soft x - ray emitting point sources which are likely to be radio - quiet thermally - emitting isolated neutron stars ( nss ; for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nearest of these systems is rx  j1856.5@xmath03754   ( hereafter rxj1856 ) , which was first observed as an unidentified point source in the _ einstein _",
    "slew survey @xcite and later identified as an isolated ns by @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations in the optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) have strengthened this claim by detecting a faint blue optical counterpart @xcite , measuring its proper motion @xcite , and identifying a bow - shock @xmath7 nebula around the source @xcite .",
    "@xcite also used _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "data to measure a parallax distance of @xmath8pc to rxj1856",
    ". however , @xcite have recently re - analyzed the same data and determined a distance of @xmath9pc  the reasons for the large discrepancy are , as of yet , unclear .    despite these measurements ,",
    "the nature of rxj1856  remains a mystery .",
    "is it young or old ?",
    "is it an ordinary radio pulsar beaming away from us , a low magnetic field neutron star accreting from the interstellar medium , or a high - field `` magnetar '' ?",
    "a key to answering these questions lies in detecting pulsations from this source , from which we could then determine its spin - period , age , braking torque , and magnetic field strength . if an isolated neutron star is sufficiently magnetized , the resulting anisotropies in the temperature distribution of the crust can produce hotspots of x - ray emission on the surface of the star .",
    "if the magnetic axis is mis - aligned with the rotation axis , these hotspots may produce a periodic modulation of the soft x - ray intensity at the rotation period of the ns .",
    "even a non - detection of these pulsations can provide useful constraints on the mass , radius , and emitting geometry of the ns .",
    "searches for these pulsations were carried out by @xcite using a @xmath10ks _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "observation of rxj1856   taken on 2000 march 10 using the low energy transmission grating spectograph ( letgs , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found no pulsations and placed an upper limit on the pulsed fraction ( for frequencies @xmath11hz ) of @xmath12% .",
    "similar searches have been undertaken with archival _ rosat _  and _ asca _  data by @xcite who placed a 50% confidence limit on the pulsed fraction of @xmath13% .",
    "it should be noted that three other radio quiet isolated ns candidates have been reported to show x - ray pulsations : rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 with a period of 8.4s and a pulsed fraction of @xmath14% @xcite , rx  j0420.0@xmath05022 with a period of 22.7s and a pulsed fraction of @xmath15% @xcite , and rbs  1223 with a period of 5.16s and a pulsed fraction of @xmath16% @xcite .    in 2001 october ,",
    "rxj1856  was observed with the _ chandra _  letgs for an additional 450ks of director s discretionary time ( ddt ) over the course of @xmath17days .",
    "the purpose of the observation was to search for features in the spectrum  in particular , due to heavy elements in the ns atmosphere  in order to constrain the ns equation of state ( eos ) . however , these data are of sufficient time resolution to allow a deep search for pulsations as well .",
    "the data were made public soon after the observation was completed .",
    "we conducted brute - force period folding and advanced fourier analyses of this data in order to try to identify the spin parameters of the neutron star .",
    "in addition , we have analyzed archival observations of rxj1856  from both _",
    "rosat _  and _ chandra _  in order to specify a consistent set of upper limits to the pulsed fraction .",
    "the ddt observation comprised obsids 3382 , 3380 , 3381 , and 3399 in chronological order beginning on 2001 october 8 and ending on 2001 october 15 ( see table  [ table1 ] ) and were taken in the standard letgs configuration .",
    "the total exposure time was 450ks with significant gaps between the various obsids giving a total duration of @xmath18ks .",
    "the data were prepared in a very simple manner .",
    "we extracted all events from within @xmath19 of the centroid of the zero - order image from each obsid .",
    "the arrival times of these events were transformed to the solar system barycenter using the standard _",
    "chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao , v2.2 ) _  tool axbary , the nominal position of rxj1856  from @xcite of @xmath20 56@xmath21 355 and @xmath22 , and the preliminary level 2 orbital ephemeris file distributed with the data release .",
    "we binned the 90134 resulting events into 1.5ms time bins to create a 420 million point time series that was used in the coherent fourier analysis described in ",
    "[ sec : fft ] .",
    "a wiring error in the hrc causes each event to be tagged with the arrival time of the previous event .",
    "unfortunately not every event is telemetered to the ground , so the arrival times of recorded events are typically in error by a few ms . in order to improve the accuracy of these arrival times and to restrict the number of counts so as to make a brute - force period folding search computationally feasible , we also reprocessed the data using the time filtering scheme described by @xcite . by shifting all arrival times in the level 1 event files back to the previous event ,",
    "filtering the data spatially , barycentering , and then keeping only those events that arrived within 1ms of the previous event , we are guaranteed to have all arrival times accurate to @xmath23ms at the cost of a loss of @xmath24% of the events that were used in the fourier analysis ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "these time filtered events were used in the folding search described in ",
    "[ sec : glfold ] .    in order to verify preparation methods for the data",
    ", we processed events from the letgs observation of the crab pulsar ( obsid  759 ) in the same manner as described above .",
    "the crab pulsar was easily detected in the data at the expected barycentric rotation period and with the expected pulse profile given the hrc wiring error .",
    "in addition , significant detection of all spin harmonics up to at least the eighth ( @xmath25hz ) , indicate that fast periodicities ( @xmath26hz ) are detectable  albeit drastically suppressed  in unfiltered hrc data given enough signal - to - noise .",
    "in order to maximize our sensitivity to coherent pulsations with a variety of pulse shapes , we searched the data using two very different techniques . for maximum sensitivity to sinusoidal pulse profiles , we performed a coherent fourier analysis of all the zero - order events from the complete ddt observation . for better sensitivity to more complicated pulse profiles , we performed period folding searches on the much smaller set of time - filtered events with the significance of each trial determined by the bayesian method developed by @xcite .",
    "we fast fourier transformed the 420 million point time series described in  [ sec : prep ] and searched the resulting fourier amplitudes using an advanced pulsar search code .",
    "the search included harmonic summing to improve sensitivity to low duty - cycle pulsations , fourier interpolation to minimize the effects of `` scalloping '' @xcite , and the ability to compensate for signals with a constant frequency derivative ( i.e. an `` acceleration '' search ) by matched filtering of the complex fourier amplitudes with a series of template responses @xcite .    due to the limitations in the hrc - s time resolution , we limited our search to frequencies @xmath27hz .",
    "similarly , we restricted the range of acceptable frequency derivatives to be from @xmath28hzs@xmath4 , which encompasses the range observed for all known isolated pulsars . assuming spin down via magnetic dipole radiation , pulsars with period @xmath29 and magnetic field strengths @xmath30gauss",
    "will drift across multiple fourier bins during observations of duration @xmath31 seconds .",
    "un - accelerated searches are considerably less sensitive to pulsars with magnetic fields higher than this threshold . for a 100ms period and a 630ks time series ( as for the ddt observation ) , this implies reduced sensitivity for pulsars with @xmath32 g , thereby effectively eliminating a significant fraction of possible phase space for such sources .",
    "a near worst - case scenario for un - accelerated searches is the crab pulsar ( for which @xmath33hz and @xmath34hzs@xmath4 ) which would drift by @xmath35 fourier bins during the observation . in a raw power spectrum",
    "such a signal would be smeared below detectability . after accounting for",
    "the number of independent trials searched , no candidates were detected with an equivalent gaussian significance of greater than 2@xmath36 . for completeness , we also searched for signals with positive frequency derivative from @xmath37hzs@xmath4 and detected no significant pulsations .",
    "in addition to searching the _ chandra _  ddt observation , we searched the archival letgs observation ( obsid 113 , @xmath38ks ) of rxj1856  as well as the 1997 october 9 _ rosat _  high resolution imager ( hri ) observation ( @xmath39ks ) of rxj1856  using virtually identical techniques . not surprisingly , no candidates were found with significance greater than 2@xmath36 in either case .",
    "in addition , none of the lower significance candidates from these searches matched any of the low - significance candidates from the ddt observation .",
    "we conducted brute - force period folding of the time - filtered events from each of the individual observations using a modified version of the @xcite technique that allows searching over @xmath40 as well as @xmath41 .",
    "this method maintains sensitivity to a wide variety of pulsed signals by matching the complexity of a signal s pulse shape with an appropriate number of bins in the folded profile aligned at the optimal phase .",
    "successful use of this search algorithm has been made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each individual observation was searched using the time - filtered events described in  [ sec : prep ] over a range of frequencies from @xmath42hz and frequency derivatives from @xmath43hzs@xmath4 .",
    "the candidate lists from each observation were then compared to those from each of the other observations to find likely matches in @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "no interesting candidates were found .",
    "most of the cpu time used in the searches was spent searching the two longest observations ( obsids 3380 and 3381 ) together over a range of frequencies @xmath44hz and frequency derivatives from @xmath3hzs@xmath4 .",
    "the number of operations required for a folding search that includes @xmath40 goes as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the total number of photons and @xmath31 is the total duration of the observation ( @xmath47 and @xmath48ks for these two observations together ) .",
    "this search required over @xmath49 operations and produced no statistically significant candidates .",
    "since no candidates were found in any part of our search , upper limits on the pulsed fraction of rxj1856  can be derived based on the predicted response of a worst - case sinusoidal signal during the fourier analysis .",
    "we use the standard definition of the pulsed fraction @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the pulsed and unpulsed count rates respectively .",
    "since a sinusoidal signal in the presence of noise with a total number of events @xmath53 produces an expected normalized power of @xmath54 , the pulsed fraction can be written as @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when no pulsation is detected during a search , an upper limit on the pulsed fraction that the data could still contain can be calculated at some level of confidence @xmath56 , based on the maximum observed power in the search .",
    "@xcite describe how to calculate the signal power that would be required to produce a measured power greater than the maximum observed power a fraction @xmath56 of the time .",
    "these calculations are sensitive to how the data are binned and the number of independent trials searched  quantities that can be difficult to estimate .",
    "once this signal power has been calculated , substituting it for @xmath57 in the definition for pulsed fraction gives the upper limit on @xmath58 at a confidence level @xmath56 .",
    "our best estimates for the limiting pulsed fraction for rxj1856  based on the new _ chandra _  observations , as well as the archival _ chandra _  and _ rosat _  observations , are given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "slightly different upper limits are quoted based on the fact that the number of trials is very different when comparing an acceleration search with a more standard un - accelerated fourier analysis . for the archival data sets , our 50% confidence upper limits for un - accelerated searches",
    "are roughly consistent with ( but slightly more conservative than ) the values reported in @xcite and @xcite . for `` normal '' pulsars with relatively slow spin periods ( i.e. @xmath59hz and @xmath60hzs@xmath4 ) , the un - accelerated values are more appropriate .",
    "the 99% confidence upper limits determined here of 4.1% or 4.5% for un - accelerated or accelerated signals respectively , are the most constraining limits yet on the pulsed fraction of x - ray emission from rxj1856 .",
    "the fact that no pulsations have been observed in such sensitive observations is a surprising result , especially considering the fact that three other isolated ns candidates have measured pulsed fractions of well over 10% ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "there are at least three potential reasons for the lack of observed pulsations : 1 ) radiation from the ns is uniform in intensity and emitted isotropically ( possibly due to a uniform temperature distribution and a weak magnetic field ) .",
    "2 ) the viewing angle or emitting geometries are unfavorable .",
    "3 ) gravitational bending effects near the ns decrease the intrinsic pulsed fraction .",
    "we will address each of these possibilities in turn .    while uniform temperature blackbody models with @xmath61ev seem to provide the best fits to the observed x - ray spectra , for the @xmath62pc distance of @xcite the implied ns `` radiation '' or `` redshifted '' radius @xmath63 is too small ( @xmath64 km ) for any known eos @xcite .",
    "while the new distance measurement of @xcite increases the radiation radius to @xmath65 km , since the true radius is always less than the radiation radius these values are still difficult to reconcile with most eoss ",
    "although self - bound quark configurations ( i.e. strange stars ) may be possible @xcite . unfortunately , an even bigger problem with the uniform temperature blackbody models is that they under - predict the measured optical flux by a factor of @xmath66 @xcite .    if the surface temperature distribution of a ns is non - uniform , we may expect to see x - ray pulsations at the star s rotation period resulting from the motion of the hotter surface features ( presumably polar cap `` hotspots '' ) through our line - of - sight .",
    "there are at least two geometries , though , that preclude the observation of such pulsations no matter what the properties of the ns or its hotspots : when the line - of - sight is aligned with the rotation axis of the star , or when the polar cap axis is aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "neither of these possibilities can be ruled out with the current observations , and given the modulation strengths of the other observed isolated nss , this may be the simplest explanation for the lack of pulsations from rxj1856 .",
    "finally , gravitational bending effects on pulsations from hotspots on neutron stars have been studied in detail by many groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all have showed that the measured pulsed fraction is a strong function of the angle between the rotation axis and polar cap axis , the angle between the rotation axis and the line - of - sight , the hotspot size as a fraction of the total surface area ( @xmath67 ) , and the mass and radius of the neutron star itself .    for rxj1856",
    ", one can compensate for the under - prediction of the optical / uv flux by the uniform temperature blackbody model ( when fit to the x - ray data alone ) with the simple addition of a cool ( @xmath16ev ) blackbody component from the entire ns surface . in this model ,",
    "the x - ray flux comes from thermal emission from much smaller ( and presumably polar cap ) hotspots @xcite . for the 60pc distance to rxj1856",
    ", @xcite find acceptable two - component blackbody fits to the optical , uv , and x - ray data with @xmath68 , provided that @xmath69 km and @xmath70_@xmath71  ( due to the `` causality '' limit ) . if such stars are possible , those with `` reasonable '' masses ( i.e. @xmath72_@xmath71 ) would be extremely compact , with @xmath73km@xmath6 .",
    "the extreme gravitational fields of such compact nss significantly bend the light emitted from the surface and reduce the observed pulsed fraction .",
    "@xcite calculated the likelihood of detecting pulsations of a given pulsed fraction .",
    "] after integrating over all possible polar cap and line - of - sight angles as a function of @xmath67 and the neutron star radius - to - mass ratio .",
    "figure  6 of @xcite shows the fraction of neutron stars with pulsed fraction greater than a specific value , plotted for several values of the radius - to - mass ratio , using the more traditional units km@xmath6 is equivalent to that of @xcite , who set @xmath74 giving @xmath75 . ]",
    "for stars as compact as those implied by the 60pc two - component fit mentioned above , less than @xmath16% yield pulsed fractions at or above the limits reported here .    by transforming the two - component blackbody fit to 140pc and noting that @xmath67 is independent of the distance",
    ", we find @xmath77 km .",
    "this upper limit is compatible with virtually all modern eoss which predict @xmath78 km @xcite .",
    "for a `` canonical '' neutron star with @xmath79 km , @xmath80_@xmath71 , and @xmath81km@xmath6 , the majority ( @xmath82% ) would show pulsed fractions in excess of our limits @xcite .",
    "similarly , except for highly unlikely and unfavorable viewing geometries , stars with much higher values of @xmath83 ( i.e. @xmath84km@xmath6 ) may be excluded by the lack of pulsations from rxj1856 .",
    "these facts imply  but do not require  that rxj1856  is a relatively compact ns .",
    "it is important to remember in this discussion of ns hotspots that no truly reliable estimates of a ns radius to mass ratio can be derived from blackbody spectral fits , since these fits only yield estimates of the radiation radius ( @xmath85 ) provided the distance is known .",
    "furthermore , the inferred area of the x - ray emitting region is strongly dependent upon the presence and properties of any atmospheric component .",
    "since there are as yet no atmospheric models consistent with the current data @xcite , clearly , detailed spectral analysis and modeling of the 2001-epoch _ chandra _ data should be of great use in trying to explain the lack of pulsations from and the overall nature of this enigmatic object .",
