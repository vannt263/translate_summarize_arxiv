    "the presence of the softly broken sector in the mssm introduces a large number of new physical parameters . in particular , compared to the standard model ( sm ) , we have additional 36 mixing angles and 40 phases that give rise to flavor and cp violation .",
    "the requirement that the supersymmetric and the sm contributions to physical observables agree with the experimental data , gives strong constraints on the flavor - breaking structure of the soft terms in the mssm .",
    "in particular at least one of the following conditions is needed in order to suppress large supersymmetric contribution to a generic fcnc process :    * _ degeneracy . _ the masses of the sfermions present in the loop have almost the same values * _ alignment . _",
    "the assumption is that quark and squark mass matrices are nearly simultaneously diagonalized by a supersymmetric field rotation , either in the down or in the up sector  @xcite . * _ irrelevancy . _",
    "the suppressions is obtained if the particles in the loop are very heavy .",
    "we study flavor physics in the framework of hierarchical soft terms , in which the first two generations of squarks and sleptons are heavier than the rest of the supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "the flavor structure of the first and second generation squarks is tightly constrained by @xmath0 physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper bounds on the masses of the first two generations of squarks are much looser than for the other supersymmetric particles",
    ". therefore one can relax the flavor constraints , without compromising naturalness , by taking the first two generations of squarks much heavier than the third  @xcite .",
    "this procedure alleviates , but does not completely solve , the flavor problem and a further suppression mechanism for the first two generations must be present .",
    "however , it is not difficult to conceive the existence of such a mechanism which operates if , for instance , the soft terms respect an approximate u(2 ) symmetry acting on the first two generations  @xcite . in the case of hierarchy",
    "@xcite , the small expansion parameter describing the flavor violation is the mismatch between the third - generation quarks identified by the yukawa coupling and the third - generation squarks identified by the light eigenstates of the soft - term mass matrix .",
    "this small mismatch can be related to the hierarchy of scales present in the squark mass matrix and to ckm angles . however , for the phenomenological implications we are interested in , we do not have to specify any such relation and we can work in an effective theory where the first two generations of squarks have been integrated out .",
    "their only remnant in the effective theory is the small mismatch between third - generation quarks and squarks .",
    "let us consider the gluino contribution to a @xmath1 process in the left - handed down quark sector , @xmath2 , neglecting for simplicity chirality changes .",
    "the amplitude of such a process is proportional to @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a loop function , @xmath5 is the gluino mass and @xmath6 is the unitary matrix diagonalizing the 6@xmath76 down squark squared mass matrix @xmath8 in a basis in which the down quark mass matrix is diagonal",
    ". we can simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl ] ) by using a perturbative expansion in the small off - diagonal entries of the squark mass matrix .",
    "the `` degenerate '' case is obtained in the limit in which the squark masses in the loop function coincide : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the @xmath12-th derivative of the function .",
    "the @xmath13 parameters are in this case normalized to the universal scalar mass @xmath14 .    in the `` hierarchical '' limit , the contribution to the loop function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl ] ) from the heavy squarks is negligible .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl ] ) becomes @xmath15 here @xmath16 as before , where now @xmath14 is interpreted as the third - generation squark mass .",
    "we have defined @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 is again a normalized mass insertion .",
    "also , @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 the difference between the two schemes , the degenerate and the hierarchical one , is given by the order one difference between a function and its derivative .",
    "however , this difference becomes larger when we consider @xmath22 : @xmath23      g^{(1)}(x ) ( \\hat\\delta^{ll}_{ij})^2 &      \\text{(hierarchical case ) . }",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] therefore , if @xmath14 is the same in the two cases we find that the amplitudes for @xmath24 and @xmath25 processes satisfy the relation @xmath26",

    "the bounds on the flavor - violating parameters @xmath28 are summarized in table  [ tab : bounds ] and compared with the bounds obtained in the case of degeneracy .",
    "an early analysis of the hierarchical case was presented in ref .",
    "it is plausible to expect that the size of the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 can not be smaller than the corresponding ckm angles , @xmath31 , @xmath32 respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , it is particularly interesting to probe experimentally flavor processes up to the level of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the present constraints on the @xmath36 transitions and on @xmath37 are at the edge of probing this region .",
    "an interesting conclusion is that hierarchical soft terms predict that new - physics effects in @xmath38 transitions can be expected just beyond the present experimental sensitivity .",
    "@xmath39    another interesting point regarding the phenomenology of the hierarchical framework is the fact that the new - physics effects in @xmath40 transitions are particularly promising .",
    "for example recent measurements from the cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite collaborations have shown a mild tension between the experimental value and the sm prediction for the @xmath41 mixing phase , at the @xmath42 level  @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical case allows values of the phase @xmath41 about three times larger than in the degenerate case , in agreement with the generic expectation from eq .",
