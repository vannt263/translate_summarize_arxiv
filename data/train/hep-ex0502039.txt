    "in the last decade convincing evidence has been found for a non - vanishing rest mass of neutrinos .",
    "if neutrinos are massive the weak and mass eigenstates are not necessarily identical , a fact well known in the quark sector where both types of states are connected by the ckm - matrix .",
    "this would allow for a similar mixing matrix in the leptonic sector called pmns - matrix and for the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations , a kind of flavour oscillation , which is already known in other particle systems .",
    "currently we have three evidences for neutrino oscillations coming from accelerators , the atmosphere and the sun .",
    "all evidences will be discussed in a two flavour scenario , where the mixing is described by @xmath1 with @xmath2 as the mixing angle , analoguous to the cabibbo angle in the quark mixing matrix . the oscillation probability for one neutrino flavour @xmath3 into another one @xmath4 is given by p ( _ _ ) = ^2 ( 1.27 ) m with = @xmath5 as the difference of two mass eigenstates @xmath6 , @xmath7 the distance from the neutrino source to the detector and @xmath8 the neutrino energy .",
    "the lsnd experiment at lanl was a 167 t mineral oil based liquid scintillation detector using scintillation and cerenkov light for detection .",
    "it consisted of an approximately cylindrical tank 8.3 m long and 5.7 m in diameter .",
    "lsnd took data from 1993 - 1998 .",
    "for the  decay at rest  analysis in the channel @xmath9 , the signal reaction was + p e^+ + n as experimental signature a positron within the energy range 20 mev @xmath10 60 mev together with a time and spatial correlated delayed 2.2 mev photon from p(n,@xmath11)d is required .",
    "after background subtraction indeed an excess of @xmath12 events was observed @xcite . interpreting those events as oscillation signal",
    "it would correspond to a transition probability of @xmath13 . + with rather similiar parameters",
    "the karmen experiment was operated at rutherford appleton laboratory from 1990 to 2001 , finding no evidence for an oscillation signal @xcite ( see figure [ lsnd ] ) . to which extent both experiments are in agreement or not is a severe statistical problem .",
    "a combined analysis on both data sets has been performed @xcite .",
    "two regions remain where both experiments are compatible with a positive effect , one at @xmath14 and one with @xmath15 . + with the region known , it is possible to perform a new experiment to test this evidence .",
    "the experiment miniboone at fermilab is exactly doing that .",
    "the neutrino beam is produced by the fermilab booster , sending a high intensity pulsed proton beam of 8 gev on a be - target .",
    "the positively charged secondaries , mostly pions , are focused by a magnetic horn and brought into a decay tunnel .",
    "this results in an almost pure beam ( contamination less than 0.3 % ) .",
    "the detector itself is installed about 500 m away from the end of the decay tunnel .",
    "it consists of 800 t of pure mineral oil , contained in a 12.2 m diameter spherical tank .",
    "a support structure carries about 1550 phototubes for detection of cerenkov and scintillation light . to explore the lsnd evidence to a level of 5@xmath16 about 10@xmath17 protons on target",
    "are required ( see figure [ lsnd ] ) .",
    "more than 30 % of the data have been obtained and by 2005 first results can be expected .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      during the last decade enormous progress has been made in observational cosmology and the precision of current data allows to put some limits on neutrino masses .",
    "according to standard cosmology , in connection with the 3k cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) there should exist a 1.96 k relic neutrino background .",
    "taking the particle densities of both the well known relation for the density _",
    "h^2 = can be obtained .",
    "hence by measuring @xmath18 the sum of all three neutrino masses can be obtained .",
    "taking the upper limit from tritium beta decay and the oscillation results , neutrinos can still contribute up to 15 % of the total density .",
    "cosmological bounds basically stem from large scale structure surveys .",
    "neutrinos , being relativistic particles , at the beginning of structure formation effectively washed out small scale perturbations . hence , the net result is less small scale objects and thus a suppression in the power spectrum given by @xcite -8 should be observed .",
    "however , all mass bounds obtained are depending on the cosmological model used .",
    "currently the standard lore is a @xmath19cdm model with adiabatic linear perturbations . in addition",
    ", the other cosmological parameters have to be known , currently determined by cmb observations .",
    "the reason is that there is a strong correlation of @xmath20 with other cosmological parameters @xcite . depending on the assumptions and data used limits on the neutrino mass between 0.3 - 3 ev have been obtained @xcite , even a non - vanishing rest mass could be obtained showing the strong dependence on the assumptions . a comprehensive recent analysis on cmd and sdss data can be found in @xcite .",
    "to sum it up , it is fair to say , that cosmological bounds achieved the same level of sensitivity as laboratory experiments . in the future the comparison of all three areas , beta decay , neutrinoless double beta decay and cosmological mass determinations will improve and it will be very exciting to explore their consistency and gain further information on the neutrino mass .",
    "neutrino physics has made major progress over the last decade . a non - vanishing rest mass has been established in oscillation experiments .",
    "the solar neutrino problem is solved in being due to matter oscillations , independently confirmed by nuclear reactor searches .",
    "however , the three evidences do not all fit together and if all are true , more neutrinos than those from the standard model are needed .",
    "the next step will be to more precisely determine the elements of the full 3x3 mixing matrix , ultimately trying to detect cp - violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "the first step to do is a more precise determination of the angle @xmath0 in nuclear reactor searches and off - axis beams . + neutrino oscillations do not determine the absolute mass scales . for that beta decay ,",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay and cosmological studies can be used . in all three areas",
    "major progress has been achieved and can be expected in the next decade .",
    "this work is supported by a heisenberg fellowship of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) ."
