    "most of our knowledge of galaxies is based on observations of the local universe , although distant universe observations have also provided a wealth of information .",
    "statistical studies of galaxies at high redshift are mostly limited to rich galaxy clusters mainly due to observational limitations .",
    "galaxy clusters are important cosmological environments where key galaxy transformation such as stripping and strangulation occur . however , in the hierarchical formation of structure rich clusters are the latest structures to be formed .",
    "lower mass systems or galaxy groups may have been the place where galaxies experience a substantial degree of evolution through processes such as mergers and tidal interaction , as a result of the higher efficiency of these processes in the lower velocity dispersion environment of groups .",
    "the galaxy luminosity function ( lf )  the number of galaxies per unit volume in the luminosity interval @xmath15 to @xmath16  has been widely used to study the formation of galaxies and the evolution of galaxy populations with redshift .",
    "it is also an excellent statistical tool for describing how different environments influence the properties of galaxies .",
    "both the bright end ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the faint end ( @xcite , @xcite ) of the lf have been the subject of in - depth studies , as they offer strong observational constraints for models of galaxy formation and evolution . while the bright end of the lf is affected by agn feedback ( @xcite ) , the faint - end slope is predominantly influenced by feedback from supernovae ( @xcite ) , and provide a direct indicator of the significance of dwarf galaxies , which are expected to behave differently in rich and poor clusters .",
    "multi - colour lfs , in particular , probe the history of the faint galaxy population , including its star formation history  see for example , @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of studies of the galaxy lf give faint - end slopes in the range @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "most of these have limited magnitude depth ( @xmath19 ) and recent deep studies are mostly confined to rich local clusters ( see table 1 in @xcite and table a.1 in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these studies not only disagree on the value of the faint - end slope , but they also disagree on the exact form of it , as some studies ( e.g. @xcite ) found upturns ; a single schechter function was not an adequate fit to the faint end , and a double schechter function was required to give a reasonable fit .",
    "the existence of these upturns is very sensitive to the method used to determine galaxy membership , with some approaches including spurious galaxies or excluding genuine cluster members due to their low surface brightness .",
    "the evolution of the faint - end slope is hard to study , mainly because the number of faint galaxies detected decreases sharply with increasing redshift .",
    "@xcite found that the faint - end slope of a field galaxy population became shallower with increasing redshift ( up to @xmath20 ) for all galaxy spectral types .",
    "however , to account for the photometric redshift errors of the galaxies , they weighted the galaxies as probability - smoothed luminosity distribution at the redshift at which they were measured .",
    "this places an important caveat on the interpretation of their data , and hence on their results . on the other hand , simulations by @xcite show a measurable dependence of the faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function on redshift .",
    "however , most of this dependence is seen over a relatively large redshift range , @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , it is hard to discriminate galaxy environments in such studies .",
    "x - ray surveys remain one of the most popular methods of finding galaxy systems . due to the strong density dependence of x - ray emissivity ,",
    "x - ray cluster selection is much less vulnerable to contamination along the line - of - sight than optical methods .",
    "the xmm - large scale survey ( xmm - lss ) ( @xcite ) , a contiguous x - ray survey , has a well - defined selection function which is used to produce a sample of galaxy groups to study their intracluster medium and galaxy properties at medium to high redshift . @xcite",
    "have presented a study of a sample of 29 galaxy systems from the xmm - lss survey , drawn from an area of 5 deg@xmath22 out to a redshift of z = 1.05 .",
    "the cluster distribution peaks around z = 0.3 and t=1.5 kev , half of the objects being groups with a temperature below 2 kev .    in this paper",
    ", we use the xmm - lss optical follow - up observations to study the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function in galaxy groups and poor clusters since @xmath23 . given the observational biases  distant groups are more massive and hotter  we study whether the redshift dependencies are weaker or stronger when the intrinsic properties of the systems , for instance , intracluster medium temperature , are taken into account .    by using a deep ( @xmath24 ) optical survey of x - ray selected galaxy clusters up to redshift of @xmath25",
    ", we aim in this paper to clarify the debate on the faint - end slope of the lfs of low - mass ( @xmath26 ) galaxy clusters ( or groups ) , and to explore the existence of any dips , or upturns at the faint end , and to establish whether the slope shows trends with redshift or intracluster medium temperature .",
    "comparison with previous results can help to elucidate the universality of galaxy cluster lfs .",
    "furthermore , the scaling relation of total optical luminosity with temperature and x - ray luminosity for our cluster sample can shed light on the mass - to - light ratios of low - mass systems when compared to rich clusters .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows : in section 2 , we describe the optical catalogue used to calculate the lfs .",
    "then , we describe the data reduction and the method used to construct the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) and the subsequent lfs , and the technique adopted for the background subtraction . in section 3 , we describe our results , starting with the individual cluster lfs , and then the redshift - stacked clusters and temperature - stacked clusters . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss our results and compare them with other studies . finally ,",
    "in section 5 , we summarise our conclusions .    throughout this article",
    ", we adopt the cosmological parameters estimated by @xcite , namely : @xmath27  km  s@xmath28  mpc@xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "optical photometry of the xmm - lss survey was obtained from the canada - france - hawaii telescope wide synoptic legacy survey , referred to as the cfhtls wide survey .",
    "data were obtained in five passbands ( @xmath31 , @xmath3 , @xmath4,@xmath32 , @xmath5 ) down to a nominal magnitude limit of @xmath33 .",
    "of the 19 deg@xmath22 of cfhtls wide data available in the w1 survey area , 4 deg@xmath22 overlap with the x - ray selected cluster catalogue presented by @xcite .",
    "hence our photometric data are drawn from four @xmath34 catalogues derived from the survey data .",
    "the data used in this paper are based upon the reduction procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "source extraction and photometry were performed using sextractor v2.5.0 ( bertin and arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "zero point information for sources detected in the cfhtls wide field survey w1 area was extrapolated from common sources detected in the sloan digital sky survey equatorial patch which overlaps the southern edge of the w1 area .",
    "xmm - lss class 1 ( c1 ) clusters are a well - controlled x - ray selected and spectroscopically confirmed cluster sample .",
    "the criteria used to construct the sample guarantee negligible contamination by point - like sources .",
    "the observations of the clusters were performed in a homogeneous way ( 10 - 20 ks exposures ) . for full details of the c1 sample ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the main properties of the sample are shown in table [ c1usters ] .",
    "detailed information on the c1 selection process can be found in @xcite .",
    "17 out of the 29 xmm - lss c1 clusters are covered by the cfhtls wide field survey . in this paper , we study the luminosity functions of 14 of these 17 clusters  dropping the three with the highest redshifts ( clusters with xlssc numbers 2,29 , and 1 ) because their photometric data is too poor to allow useful constraints to be obtained .",
    "galaxies were detected by sextractor ( @xcite ) .",
    "luminosity functions ( lfs ) were produced in three of the five cfhtls ( @xmath31 , @xmath3 , @xmath4,@xmath32 , @xmath5 ) filter bands , namely , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . to determine the completeness of the lfs",
    ", we took into account the limiting apparent magnitude in each field .",
    "the completeness limits for each filter was determined using the apparent magnitude lfs of all data ( down to the faintest magnitudes available ) for each c1 cluster individually .",
    "variations in seeing and exposure time across the cfhtls fields used here are small , and it was found that for each filter there was a common completeness limit at which all lfs started to drop below the faint end power law slope .",
    "note that the lf turn - up reported by some authors ( see section 4.2 ) , which could potentially introduce an error into this method for estimating completeness , falls beyond the faint limit of our lfs ( e.g. at -16 in @xmath3 band ) , except in our three closest clusters , and hence can not seriously bias our estimates of the completeness limits .",
    "the completeness threshold magnitudes for the three filters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 were found to be 24 , 23.5 and 23 , respectively .",
    "these values are also consistent with results based on comparison of the number counts per field to deeper data from the cfhtls deep field and cccp megacam observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "each entry in the catalogues is associated with a flag value which indicates the degree of reliability of the data .",
    "flag is a short integer , and a value of @xmath35 denotes good data .",
    "the more unreliable the data is , the higher the flag value becomes .",
    "we included all catalogue entries with flag @xmath36 , which includes sources with very close and bright neighbours or some bad pixels and sources which are originally blended with other sources .",
    "this may admit some problematic galaxies but this is better than excluding many genuine cluster members , because many clusters contain significant number of blended sources .",
    "factors that may raise the flag to @xmath37 include sources with saturated pixels , truncated sources , incomplete or corrupted data and sources with memory overflow during deblending or extraction .",
    "catalogue entries with flag @xmath37 constitute only @xmath38 of the total number of entries , and were all removed .",
    "many of the removed entries are fainter than the threshold magnitude and hence would have been removed anyway .",
    "each entry in the catalogue also includes a stellarity class value , star , with values ranging from 0 to 1 .",
    "the lower its value , the more likely the detected object is a galaxy .",
    "data points with different star values were checked by iraf and their radial profiles were examined to see if they matched the typical profile of a star or a galaxy .",
    "typically , objects with star @xmath39 0.85 were found to be stars , whilst those with @xmath40 0.85 were galaxies .",
    "therefore , only catalogue entries with star values of 0.85 or less were included when constructing the lfs .",
    "spectral temperatures of the xmm - lss clusters , and the resulting values of @xmath41 ( which allow for the evolution in critical density with redshift ) , were measured by the saclay team ( @xcite ) . to construct colour - magnitude diagrams",
    ", we selected all galaxies within a circle of radius , @xmath42 of the clusters .",
    "this radius limit , @xmath43 , represents an estimate of @xmath44 .",
    "colour - magnitude diagrams were produced for all 14 clusters for colour bands : @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the factor , 1.5 does not have a large effect on the fitted parameters of the schechter function ; we compared the results of @xmath45 to @xmath46 and found that the faint - end slope , @xmath7 , was only changed within its 1 @xmath47 errors .",
    "the cmd were used to colour select galaxies which might be cluster members , hence reducing the background due to interlopers .",
    "the colours used for this were @xmath48 versus @xmath49 , @xmath50 versus @xmath51 , and @xmath52 versus @xmath53 for the three filters respectively , where the subscript _ 2 _ refers to the @xmath54 arcsec aperture used in the magnitude measurements . to define and select cluster members in the cmd , we defined upper and lower colour cuts and only galaxies between these two lines were used to produce the lf , as galaxies outside these limits were most likely not cluster members . to define these two colour cuts ,",
    "we first defined the red sequence line in the cmd and then pushed this line up and down to allow for statistical errors , and for the likely range of galaxy colours .    to define the red sequence line , we first defined the slope and then its y - intercept .",
    "we checked that the bcgs lay at the centre of the x - ray emission in all clusters , and then calculated the red sequence slope in each case by fitting a straight line to the bright galaxies in the cmd .",
    "bright galaxies are defined as those with magnitude ranging from that of the brightest cluster galaxy , @xmath55 , to a magnitude of @xmath56 , inclusive .",
    "we found that the slope of the red sequence line for the 14 c1 clusters showed a mild trend with redshift : it was steeper for high - redshift clusters .",
    "a similar trend was observed by @xcite and attributed to a deficit of faint red galaxies at high redshifts , consistent with the galactic downsizing picture .",
    "we divided our cluster sample into two redshift ranges : low - redshift clusters ( @xmath57 ) and intermediate - redshift clusters ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "clusters from each group share a common red sequence line slope with a small variation .",
    "the common slope for the low - redshift range was -0.007 and -0.025 for the second range . instead of using a different red sequence slope for each cluster",
    ", we used the common slope of the redshift groups for all clusters belonging to that redshift group .",
    "the y - intercepts of the red sequence lines were different for each galaxy cluster and depended on the average colour of the bright galaxies as defined above .",
    "to fix the value of the intercept for each cluster , the red sequence line was normalised so as to pass through the point in the cmd which has a magnitude of @xmath59 and colour equal to the average colours of the bright galaxies .",
    "this point and the value of the slope completes the definition of the red sequence line .",
    "both upper and lower colour cuts have the same slope as the red sequence line . in order to define the upper colour cut",
    ", we have to determine the upper ( red ) limit to the cluster red sequence .",
    "we took into account the statistical scatter of the colours of the faintest galaxies on the red sequence .",
    "these galaxies are defined as those inside a @xmath60 ( magnitude by colour units ) box in the cmd centred on the faint end of the red sequence line ( see figure [ color_cuts ] ) .",
    "the size of this box was chosen to include the faintest galaxies most probably belonging to the red sequence after studying the cmd of the c1 sample .",
    "the expected scatter of these galaxies , @xmath47 , is calculated by averaging their colour errors , that is the y - axis errors in the cmd .",
    "the upper colour cut , is then taken to be the red sequence line pushed upward by @xmath61 . by taking into account this scatter ,",
    "we ensure that almost all genuine cluster red sequence galaxies should fall beneath the red cut , since the statistical error on the brighter galaxies will be smaller .",
    "similarly , the lower ( blue ) colour cut is the red sequence line pushed downward in the cmd . in this case , the shift has to account for both statistical scatter , and for the fact that late - type cluster galaxies are intrinsically bluer than red sequence galaxies .",
    "the shift was therefore taken to be @xmath62 . where @xmath63 is the theoretical colour difference between ellipticals and spirals .",
    "this was estimated using a simple model which calculates what colour late - type galaxies would have when redshifted by different amounts , as described in @xcite .",
    "@xmath63 is a function of redshift only and the redshift of the galaxy cluster was used to determine its value .",
    "this method of estimating @xmath63 ignores any intrinsic evolution in the colour offset between red and blue cluster galaxies .",
    "however , the detailed combo-17 study of @xcite ( see their figure 1 ) shows that the colour difference between blue and red sequence cluster galaxies changes little over the redshift range ( 0 - 0.7 ) spanned by our clusters .",
    "figure [ color_cuts ] shows an example of our use of colour cuts for selection of cluster galaxies .    of course , background and foreground galaxies will still contaminate the sample after the colour cut has been applied , and this contamination must be estimated and removed statistically . for this purpose",
    "we used all data in the catalogue to which a given galaxy cluster belonged .",
    "in addition to simple poisson fluctuations , uncertainties in removing background and foreground galaxies arise from large scale structure . to quantify the extra fluctuations arising from this",
    ", we proceeded as follows .",
    "the whole catalogue @xmath64 area was divided into smaller blocks with areas comparable to that of the cluster in question .",
    "any of these blocks covered mostly ( 60% or more , by area ) by a galaxy cluster , were considered to be dominated by a cluster and hence were discarded from the background calculation .",
    "blocks covered by clusters to an extent less than 60% , were not discarded but the portion covered by the @xmath43 circle of any galaxy cluster was removed , so the final blocks used have somewhat different areas .    for each background block , an lf was produced in just the same way as for the cluster itself .",
    "the same values of the upper and lower red sequence limits of the galaxy cluster in question , were applied to all its background block areas , so galaxies beyond those limits were removed .",
    "the application of colour cuts to both source and background fields reduces the noise level in both of them , and hence in the final background - subtracted lf .",
    "we then divided each background block lf by its area , added them and normalised the resulting single lf to the area of the galaxy cluster in question .",
    "the error bars on the averaged background lf were calculated from the scatter of the individual block lfs contributing to it .",
    "this method of estimating the background has some advantages over the more conventional background estimation method using an outer annulus around the galaxy cluster , since it uses a large background region , and the error estimate allows for the variance arising from the large scale structure .",
    "finally , for each cluster we subtracted its composite background lf from the cluster lf , and propagated the errors .",
    "apparent magnitudes were converted to absolute magnitudes , using the distance for each cluster , and applying k - corrections calculated from table 3 ( for hubble type e ) in @xcite .",
    "the use of early - type k - corrections is common in cluster studies , and justified by the dominance of early - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "however , if there were a systematic trend in early - type fraction with magnitude , then this could lead to some distortion of the lf slope . to quantify the maximum possible effect",
    ", we note that , using the tables in @xcite , the k - correction for hubble type e at z=0.6 for @xmath5 is 0.37 while it is 0.05 for hubble type i m ) . assuming ( very conservatively ) a systematic change from a 100% early - type to 100% late - type population across the faint end slope of our lfs , the impact of a differential error of 0.3 magnitudes on our determination of @xmath7 would still only amount to @xmath65 , which is small compared to the trends in alpha which represent some of our main results .",
    "the tables in @xcite apply to sdss filters , which differ slightly from the corresponding megacam filters .",
    "the resulting differences in k - corrections are much smaller than the differences between early - type and late - type galaxies ( about 0.03 at z=0.1 and 0.06 at z=0.6 ) , and will have negligible effect on our derived lf slopes .",
    "finally , the data were binned into bins of width 0.5 magnitude ( experiments showed that this bin size was a good choice in terms of fit quality and parameter confidence regions ) , and the resulting lfs were then fitted by a schechter function model ( @xcite ) , @xmath66",
    "where @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the characteristic magnitude , @xmath69 is the characteristic number density and @xmath7 is the faint - end slope , @xcite .",
    "contour plots of the @xmath70 , @xmath61 and @xmath71 confidence levels of @xmath7 and @xmath68 were also produced .",
    "the errors in the text and tables refer to the @xmath70 errors .",
    "we also calculated the total optical luminosity @xmath72 of each cluster by integrating the fitted schechter function from @xmath73 to -16 .",
    "in addition to single lfs for each galaxy cluster in our sample , we produced stacked luminosity functions .",
    "the radius used to determine the volume is the @xmath43 of the cluster . before stacking different clusters together , to correct for the evolution in the critical density of the universe , we multiply the lf by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the redshift",
    ", @xmath76 is the critical density of the universe , a function of @xmath75 , and @xmath77 is the redshift of the cluster .",
    "this correction is necessary for high - redshift clusters if stacked with low - redshift clusters to scale the galaxy density in each cluster to the density at redshift=0 .",
    "the faintest magnitude bin is not necessarily the same for each cluster and to account for this , we divided the total number of galaxies in each magnitude bin by the summed volume of galaxy clusters that contributed to that bin only .",
    "the stacked lfs should enable us to study the evolution of the lf with redshift and to explore any differences between clusters of different temperature .",

    "rather , we have a situation in all three photometric bands , where the faint - end slope is steeper at @xmath84 than it is at higher redshift .",
    "to visualise the behaviour of the faint - end slope in terms of both redshift and colour , we plot the faint end of the fitted luminosity functions for the three bands in figure [ alpha_evolution ] using green for @xmath3 band , red for @xmath4 band and black for @xmath5 band . for this plot ,",

    "all lfs have been renormalised to have @xmath85 at m=-19.5 .",
    "the figure shows how the faint end slope steepens towards low @xmath75 .",
    "it also illustrates colour trends in @xmath7 . at low redshift ( solid lines ) , the slopes are very similar ( though the curves are separated due to their different values of @xmath86 ) , whilst at intermediate redshift ( dashed lines ) , the slope shows a strong trend with colour .",
    "the values of @xmath7 in table [ stacked_results ] also show a trend with colour .",
    "the faint - end slope of @xmath75-stacked clusters becomes steeper as we move from @xmath5 ( red side ) band to @xmath3 ( blue side ) .",

    "the increase in the faint - end slope of the schechter function in the bluer bands means that at the faint side of the colour - magnitude diagram the blue galaxies outnumber red ones .    to explore this we produced k - corrected colour - magnitude diagram ( figure [ colour_trend ] ) of @xmath89 versus absolute @xmath90 magnitude for @xmath91 ( six clusters : 8,13,18,22,27 and 40 ) in which this trend is most obvious , and the same plot for the first redshift bin , @xmath92 in which no such trend is apparent .",
    "figure [ colour_trend ] clearly demonstrate how the distribution of cluster galaxy colours changes from @xmath12 to @xmath11 . in the @xmath3 band",
    "the evolution of @xmath7 is much stronger , especially after removing the effects of the temperature ( partial correlation ) .",
    "these trends in @xmath7 show that the fraction of blue faint galaxies at @xmath93 was larger than it is now , and suggests that these galaxies have reddened and moved    the schechter function characteristic magnitude @xmath68 in the redshift - stacked clusters showed a negative correlation with redshift .",
    "the correlation coefficients between @xmath68 and redshift are high but less significant than those between @xmath7 and redshift .",
    "however , when the partial calculations were carried out , these coefficients dropped and became consistent with zero . hence the trend in @xmath68 with @xmath75 appears to be due to a selection effect : hotter clusters are more luminous , and so are more easily detected at high redshift , and these brighter clusters also tend to have brighter @xmath68 ( @xcite ) .",
    "eight amongst the 14 c1 clusters , more than half of our sample , lie within the narrow redshift range 0.26 to 0.32 .",
    "these clusters are representative of low - mass clusters at intermediate redshifts - a population which dominates the xmm - lss cluster dataset .",

    "it can be hard to distinguish between scatter of the data points and a genuine dip in the lf .    to test the genuineness of these dips we fitted a schechter function minus a gaussian function defined by three parameters ( central magnitude , width and depth ) to these temperature stacked lfs .",

    "we therefore conclude that our data show no evidence for real dips in the optical lfs of the c1 clusters .",

    "the values we obtain for @xmath7 fall into the cluster lf range .",
    "the mass ( @xmath0 ) range of the c1 clusters is 0.6 - 19 @xmath122 ( @xcite ) and this puts the c1 sample in the lower - mass class of galaxy clusters ( poor clusters and groups ) .",

    "the steep faint end slopes seen in both indicate a larger fraction of dwarf galaxies in both groups and clusters , compared with the shallower lf slopes usually found in the field",
    ".    however , as is the case with richer clusters , the results from different studies of the luminosity function of group galaxies arrive at different results .",
    "for instance , @xcite derived a very flat ( @xmath119 ) schechter slope for x - ray bright groups  though they found a faint upturn in x - ray dim systems  and",
    "@xcite derived similarly low faint end slopes for sdss groups .",
    "@xcite used photometric data of x - ray selected systems and used all galaxies with b - r @xmath40 1.7 from the regions outside a radius of @xmath41 from the centre of the group as the background for subtraction , whilst @xcite used spectroscopic data for membership determination for their friends - of - friends selected clusters .",
    "@xcite extracted lfs for 2pigg groups , derived from the 2df galaxy redshift survey , and obtained good fits with schechter functions , with faint end slopes which increased from @xmath119 for red galaxies to @xmath136 for blue galaxies .",
    "these discrepancies in the faint - end slope from different studies could arise from a variety of causes : different cluster selection methods ( x - ray selected clusters in our case ) , spectroscopic or photometric selection of cluster galaxies , different galaxy background subtraction techniques ( see discussion in section 4.3 ) , and possibly because different clusters have different faint - end slopes depending on their large - scale environment , which will affect the incidence of infalling galaxies .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite reported an upturn at the faint end of their stacked lf , and required a sum of two schechter functions , rather than a single schechter , to obtain reasonable fits .",
    "@xcite located the upturn at -16 in the @xmath3 band , and -18.5 in @xmath5 ; the upturn of @xcite was found at a similar magnitude : -18 in the @xmath4 band . in our sample ,",
    "only the lfs for clusters 11,21 and 41 extend to the faint magnitudes in which @xcite and @xcite found their upturns .",
    "the composite lf for these systems is the first in the redshift - stacked lfs , see figures [ z_stacked_g ] , [ z_stacked_r ] and [ z_stacked_z ] .",
    "although our results agree with @xcite and @xcite regarding the steep values of the faint - end slope , we do not find any evidence for a departure from a simple power law at the faint end .",
    "other studies gave steep slopes at the faint end of cluster lfs but without evidence of sudden upturns , see for example @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied composite lfs of 65 clusters ranging in redshift from 0.05 to 0.25 and did not find upturns in their composite lfs .",
    "@xcite argued that @xcite did not see this upturn in their stacked lf because they used a weighting for the individual lfs which depends strongly on the cluster magnitude limit , such that clusters with fainter magnitude limits , which contribute to the faint magnitude bins of the stacked lf , were heavily down - weighted . in our sample , only the lfs for clusters 11,21 and 41 extend to the faint magnitude region in which @xcite and @xcite found their upturn .",
    "the composite lf for these systems is the first in the redshift - stacked lfs , see figures [ z_stacked_g ] , [ z_stacked_r ] and [ z_stacked_z ] .",
    "we did not apply any weighting method that depends on the magnitude limit and although faint - end slopes are steep in all three bands for the stacked lf of clusters 11,21 and 41 , they lack any upturn at the locations found by @xcite and @xcite . furthermore",
    ", individual lfs of these three clusters do not show any obvious upturn in the faint - end part of the lf that can be distinguished from the scatter of the data relative to the fitted schechter function .",
    "@xcite decomposed their lf by galaxy type and showed that the late - type galaxies lf was well fitted by a single schechter function with a steep slope ( @xmath137 ) , while the early - type galaxies lf could not be fitted by a single schechter function , and a composite of two schechter functions was needed , such that the faint - end upturn of the global cluster lf was due to the early - type cluster galaxies .",
    "this suggests one way of reconciling our results with those of @xcite .",
    "if in our poorer clusters late - type galaxies outnumber early - types in the intermediate and faint magnitude ranges then the lf would be steep and without any upturns .",
    "this needs to be further investigated by studying the early - type and the late - type lf separately .",
    "another possibility for the difference between our results and those of @xcite lies in the techniques used to remove non - cluster galaxies , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "the steepness of the faint end of the luminosity function reflects the number of dwarf galaxies within a cluster .",
    "estimates of this number are very sensitive to the method used to estimate and remove the contribution of background and foreground galaxies before constructing the cluster luminosity function .",
    "@xcite compared methods of membership determination based on spectroscopic data and on photometric data ( which we used ) with regard to the resulting lf .",
    "they highlighted the advantages of spectroscopic identification of cluster members .",
    "where automated photometric methods are used , they found , for example , that many large galaxies , especially those with low surface brightnesses , may be detected as many small separate objects , and warned that if these pieces of galaxies are not removed , they can produce an artificial excess of faint galaxies in cluster fields .",
    "however , we have to emphasise that although spectroscopic data can give precise information on the cluster membership , their use to study cluster lfs is limited to relatively nearby clusters , since for higher - redshift clusters , spectroscopy is feasible only for the bright cluster galaxies .",
    "@xcite used deep multicolour photometry to study the lf of a496 , using colour selection to reduce contamination by red background galaxies , and did not find the large fraction of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath137 ) inferred by some other authors , including @xcite .",
    "they suggested that this excess of dwarf galaxies in some studies might arise from inadequate removal of background , due to use of inadequate ( or no ) colour cuts .",
    "they claimed that the red sequence used by @xcite was polluted by field galaxies because they used @xmath138 vs @xmath32 in their cmd which @xcite showed was not efficient in rejecting background galaxies . in our study , we did not use @xmath138 vs @xmath32 to define the colour cuts .",
    "instead , we used @xmath139 vs @xmath3 for the @xmath3 band , @xmath140 vs @xmath4 for the @xmath4 band and @xmath141 vs @xmath5 for the @xmath5 band . moreover , our method of field lf subtraction is based on global background lf constructed by using the whole @xmath64 field of the cluster",
    ". therefore , we do nt see any obvious reason why we might have contaminated the red sequence with field galaxies in such away as to give a false steep faint - end slope .",
    "our results indicate that larger numbers of faint galaxies exist in cluster environments than in the field .",
    "it is not straightforward to understand this result , since various dynamical processes that can destroy dwarfs act more effectively in dense environments .",
    "several ideas have been proposed to explain the excess of dwarfs in clusters .",
    "@xcite argued that a primordial population of dwarf galaxies is preserved in high - pressure environments , whilst it fades away in low - pressure regions .",
    "alternatively , dwarfs could be formed by galaxies that fell into clusters from the surrounding field and were morphologically transformed .",
    "the transformation mechanism could be tidal fragmentation or so - called harassment of infalling late - type spiral galaxies by the cluster potential or by close encounters ( @xcite ) or ram pressure stripping of dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that both simulations and observations are consistent regarding the scenario of recent accretion and transformation of low - luminosity star - forming galaxies in the virgo cluster into quiescent dwarfs due to ram pressure gas stripping and galaxy starvation .",
    "they also showed that this process of transformation results in galaxies with structural and spectrophotometric properties similar to those of dwarf ellipticals .",
    "if the whole star - forming dwarf galaxy population dominating the faint end of the field luminosity function were accreted , it could be totally transformed by the cluster environment into dwarf ellipticals on timescales as short as 2 gyr .",
    "these vigorous forces acting in cluster environments may explain the steepness of lfs faint - end slopes in nearby clusters .",
    "our results show an evolutionary trend of the faint - end slope , @xmath7 , in all bands used : @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite examined the faint - end slope of the v - band lf of _ field _ galaxies with redshifts @xmath142 and found that it becomes shallower with increasing redshift : their @xmath7 changed from @xmath143 for the lowest redshift bin @xmath144 to @xmath145 for the highest redshift bin @xmath146 . in clusters ,",
    "a recent study by @xcite of an optically selected cluster sample found steepening of the faint end with decreasing redshift since @xmath147 , and that the relative number of red - sequence dwarf galaxies had increased by a factor of @xmath148 .",
    "it is possible that this lf slope trend with redshift is linked to the finding of @xcite that the ` upturn ' in the lf faint end ( i.e. the excess of galaxies above a single schechter function ) is found only in low redshift clusters .",
    "they attributed this to the recent infall of star - forming field galaxies or the whittling down of formerly more massive objects .",
    "the impact of recent infall of galaxies into clusters is also supported by the work of @xcite , who showed that des in the virgo cluster fall into two major morphological subclasses : a ) des with blue centres , thick disks or features reminsiscent of late - type galaxies , such as spiral arms or bars ; this class showed no central clustering , suggesting that they are an unrelaxed population formed from infalling galaxies .",
    "the second subclass is b ) nucleated des  a fairly relaxed population of spheroidal galaxies indicating that they have resided in the cluster for a long time , or were formed along with it .",
    "@xcite also pointed to other studies deriving similar results ( see references therein ) , indicating that this subclassification is not specific to the virgo cluster .",
    "the faint - end slopes , @xmath7 , of the redshift - stacked groups are steeper in bluer bands in almost all redshift bins . however , this trend is significant ( @xmath149 ) only for the redshift range @xmath150 .",
    "the redshift bin in which this effect seems to be absent is the first bin : @xmath151 .",
    "this suggests that the fraction of faint blue galaxies in clusters of redshift @xmath152 are higher than in local systems .",
    "figure [ colour_trend ] further illustrates this and it also shows that these blue faint galaxies appear to have reddened and moved upwards in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite who compared the fractions of passive ( red and quiescent ) and blue star - forming galaxies in cluster at @xmath153 with nearby ( @xmath154 ) clusters .",
    "they found that the fraction of passive galaxies declined strongly with redshift to at least @xmath155 .",
    "these results are also consistent with the well - known butcher - oemler effect in clusters and support the idea that dense environments are responsible for galaxy transformation from blue to red because these trends are less obvious in field environments , see @xcite .",
    "our result is also consistent with @xcite who studied the colours of galaxies as a function of luminosity and environment using the red sequence cluster survey and the sdss .",
    "they found a higher incidence of faint to moderate luminosity galaxies in high density environments at @xmath156 compared to lower redshifts and lower density environments .",
    "they interpreted this as arising from the shut - down of star formation in low mass galaxies within clusters at @xmath157 , in contrast to the situation in the field ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fact that such transformations are observed in low - mass clusters like our c1 sample , as well as in richer clusters , favours mechanisms for suppression of star formation which operate in shallower potential wells , such as strangulation , tidal interactions and galaxy mergers , rather than ram pressure stripping , which is effective mostly in rich environments with high velocity dispersions .",
    "the optical luminosity is a good indicator of cluster richness , and hence should be closely related to cluster mass , velocity dispersion and temperature ( @xcite ) . assuming that cluster mass is directly proportional to the optical light ( i.e. @xmath158 is constant ) , that the icm is in hydrostatic equilibrium and that x - ray luminosity @xmath159 scales with gas temperature t as @xmath160 ( @xcite )",
    ", it is expected that @xmath161 , and that @xmath162 .",
    "our scaling results for @xmath72 with @xmath159 and @xmath163 mostly agree well with these expectations . for the @xmath164 relation ,",
    "the logarithmic slopes are @xmath165 ( @xmath3 band ) , @xmath166 ( @xmath4 band ) and @xmath167 ( @xmath5 band ) .",
    "while for the @xmath168 relation , we have @xmath169 ( @xmath3 band ) , @xmath170 ( @xmath4 band ) and @xmath171 ( @xmath5 band ) .",
    "@xcite found @xmath172 for the @xmath164 relation and @xmath173 for the @xmath168 relation in the @xmath75 sdss band within a cluster radius of 0.5 mpc ( chosen to minimise the scatter in their scaling relations ) .",
    "the systems they used for their analysis , the rass - sdss sample , were x - ray selected , and ranged from low - mass systems of @xmath174 to massive clusters of @xmath175 , over a redshift range from 0.002 to 0.45 .",
    "their logarithmic slope value for the @xmath164 relation is not inconsistent with our value ( within the errors ) , however , their @xmath168 value is lower than ours .",
    "they attributed the departure of their results from the expected values to a breakdown in the assumption of constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "more precisely , they argued that if the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium was retained , their results would be in a good agreement with @xmath176 , as found by @xcite .",
    "however , we note that extracting @xmath72 within a fixed _ metric _ radius , will include a smaller fraction of the virial radius for higher mass clusters . hence it should be no surprise if the @xmath168 relation is flattened below the expected slope of 1.5 for self - similar clusters . using clusters from the rass - sdss sample , @xcite calculated @xmath72 within @xmath177 and @xmath108 .",
    "their @xmath108 results were ( we used @xmath178 ) : @xmath179 ( @xmath100 band ) , @xmath180 ( @xmath101 band ) and @xmath180 ( @xmath75 band ) for the @xmath164 relation and @xmath181 ( @xmath3 band ) , @xmath182 ( @xmath4 band ) and @xmath181 ( @xmath5 band ) for @xmath168 relation .",
    "these are in better agreement with our results than @xcite , and demonstrate the importance of the radius used to estimate the @xmath72 .",
    "we have studied the luminosity functions of 14 class 1 ( c1 ) xmm - lss galaxy clusters in three cfhtls megacam bands : @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the x - ray selected clusters have masses ranging from 0.6 to 19 @xmath183 , a redshift range of 0.05 to 0.61 , and icm temperature range of 0.64 to 4.80 kev .",
    "we used colour - magnitude lower and upper cuts to reduce contamination by cluster non - members , and performed background subtraction using the @xmath184 field of view in which the cluster lies .",
    "k - corrected luminosity functions of galaxies within @xmath185 were constructed for each cluster and fitted with a schechter function .",
    "total optical luminosities of the individual clusters were also computed by integrating over the fitted schechter functions .",
    "the individual lfs were also stacked together into 5 different redshift and temperature bins .",
    "the main findings are :    * a schechter function provides a good fit across most of the lf for the majority of clusters in our sample . the value of @xmath7 range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , but no evidence is found for upturns at the faint end of the schechter function , even in the lowest redshift systems , for which our lfs extend well into the dwarf regime . * @xmath186 ranges from @xmath187 to @xmath188 . however , for many ( nearly a third ) of the clusters @xmath186 values are not well - constrained . *",
    "the redshift - stacked lfs confirm that @xmath7 becomes shallower with increasing redshift .",
    "the value of @xmath7 is @xmath189 at low redshift ( 0.05 - 0.14 ) , flattening to @xmath190 at high redshift ( 0.43 - 0.61 ) in the @xmath5 band .",
    "similar trends are present in the other two bands .",
    "* @xmath7 , also steepens significantly from the red ( @xmath5 ) to the blue ( @xmath3 ) band for clusters at redshift @xmath191 .",
    "this effect is not present in our local clusters ( @xmath12 ) , suggesting reddening of the faint blue galaxies from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . * after removing the effects of redshift ( correcting for the malmquist effect ) , the temperature - stacked lfs do not exhibit any strong evidence for trends of the schechter parameters with icm temperature . * total optical luminosities for our sample range from 1.0 to 56.3 @xmath192 , and correlate strongly with x - ray luminosity .",
    "the logarithmic slopes of the @xmath164 relation are @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands respectively . * also , @xmath72 correlate strongly with the x - ray gas temperature , t. the logarithmic slopes of the @xmath168 relation are @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands respectively .",
    "* the slopes of the @xmath164 and @xmath168 relations are consistent with the established , non - self - similar , cluster @xmath193 relation and constant mass - to - light ratio , except for the @xmath5 band value of the @xmath168 relation which is higher than the expected value ( 1.5 ) by @xmath191 .",
    "* some of our stacked lfs show dips , but these appear to be artefacts arising where clusters with different faintest magnitude limits are stacked together .",
    "we therefore we conclude there is no evidence for real dips in the optical lfs of the c1 clusters .",
