    "the radio transient sky contains a number of known and potential classes of sources which emit on timescales ranging from nanoseconds to years .",
    "these classes include the sun , planets , brown dwarfs , flare stars , x - ray binaries , ultra - high energy particles , magnetars , @xmath4-ray bursts , maser flares , active galactic nuclei , radio supernovae , pulsars , annihilating black holes , and transmissions from extraterrestrial civilizations ( for a review , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite have analyzed the variability timescales of radio flares from nearly 90 different objects / events varying from flare stars to supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei and have demonstrated that variability timescales could be used as an early diagnostic of source class in future radio transient surveys .    within the last decade , as part of the analyses of pulsar surveys , a new transient phenomenon  known as fast radio bursts ( frbs )  has been identified .",
    "frbs are categorized as short duration ( few ms ) bursts that are non - repeating with dispersion measures higher than the galactic dispersion measure ( dm ) expected along that direction @xcite . the dms range from 3001600  @xmath5  pc and",
    "have so far only been observed in the 12  ghz band . to date , 11 frbs have been published ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although , most of these were discovered in archival surveys , frb  140514 @xcite and frb  131104 @xcite are real - time discoveries with a transient pipeline developed at the parkes telescope . despite a significant amount of follow - up observations which closely followed frb  140514 @xcite , and inspection of archival surveys for other frbs ,",
    "none of the frbs currently known are associated with any source counterpart at other wavelengths .    as remarked by many authors ,",
    "the high dms of frbs are suggestive of an extragalactic origin . among the proposed extragalactic source populations for frbs",
    "are annihilating black holes @xcite , flaring magnetars @xcite , binary white dwarf mergers @xcite , binary neutron star mergers @xcite , collapsing neutron stars , and neutron star - black hole mergers @xcite .    in view of the lack of any extragalactic counterparts",
    "identified so far , a number of other scenarios remain equally intriguing .",
    "@xcite considered the case of nearby galactic flaring main - sequence stars within 1  kpc as the sources of frbs .",
    "they propose that the excess dispersion comes from propagation through the stellar corona .",
    "however @xcite argued that the free - free absorption would conceal any radio signal emitted from below the corona .",
    "also , frbs exhibit quadratic dispersion curves that are consistent with the assumption of weak dispersion in a low density plasma .",
    "so , for the above model , in which the dispersion is concentrated in a relatively high density region , the quadratic dispersion approximation breaks down as the plasma frequency is comparable to the propagation frequency , posing significant problems for this model @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have recently found possible flare stars in additional frb fields using time - domain optical photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "the authors have evaluated the chance probabilities of these possible associations to be in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "frb  140514 was discovered in the radio follow - up observations of frb  110220 , three years apart within the same radio beam .",
    "@xcite also claim that these two frbs are from the same repeating source with @xmath3 confidence and are consistent with the flare - star scenario with a varying plasma blanket between bursts .",
    "more frb detections in general are necessary to confirm or refute a galactic origin of frbs .",
    "although frbs have so far been observed over a range of galactic latitudes , their true distribution on the sky remains unclear .",
    "recently , based on an analysis of parkes high time resolution universe ( htru ) mid - latitude survey data , @xcite proposed that there is a deficit of frbs at intermediate latitudes .",
    "further analyses of archival and current surveys are required to investigate this issue .",
    "in addition , @xcite have assessed the commonly used search algorithms used for frb searches which impact the frb sensitivities in individual surveys .",
    "motivated by these results , in this paper we present a single - pulse search which is sensitive to both rrats @xcite and frbs on archival data previously searched for pulsars at high galactic latitudes by @xcite . in ",
    "2 we outline the basic methodology behind the search and the detection criteria .",
    "our results and single - pulse statistics of known pulsars re - detected in this search are discussed in   3 . in ",
    "4 we use our non - detection of frbs to constrain their all - sky event rate . finally , in   5 we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the parkes high - latitude ( ph ) survey @xcite was designed to find millisecond pulsars and exotic binaries which migrate away from the galactic plane .",
    "a total of 42 pulsars were detected in this survey , of which seven were millisecond pulsars and 18 were new discoveries .",
    "the analysis of the data by @xcite was carried out using the standard periodicity search methods to find periodic signals .",
    "however no single - pulse searches have been published on these data .",
    "the single - pulse search method is very effective in detecting sporadic sources like some pulsars ( e.g.  nulling pulsars ) and rrats in the time domain since these might not be detectable in the standard periodicity searches @xcite .",
    "moreover , frbs can of course only be detected through single - pulse searches ( see below ",
    "2.2.2 ) .",
    "the ph survey covered a strip of the sky enclosed by galactic longitudes @xmath8 and galactic latitudes @xmath9 corresponding to a total sky coverage of 3588  deg@xmath10 in  475 hours .",
    "the survey began in november 2000 and ended in december 2003 and made use of the 13-beam receiver on the parkes 64-m radio telescope .",
    "data were collected simultaneously by 13 beams at a central frequency of 1374  mhz with 96 frequency channels , each 3  mhz wide .",
    "each of the 6456 pointings was observed for 265  s. for more details about the receiver system and data acquisition , see @xcite .",
    "each of these beams from the survey was processed independently using the sigproc software package .",
    "the steps included in our analysis are :    1 .   dedisperse the raw data file at a range of trial dm values and remove radio frequency interference ( rfi ) at zero dm ; 2 .",
    "search for individual pulses in the time series above signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of five and with different widths ; 3 .",
    "apply the detection criteria to filter in terms of dm , s / n , and number of beams ; 4 .   manually inspect the resulting diagnostic plots .",
    "we describe each step in detail below , and give the appropriate sigproc modules used .",
    "radio signals are affected by interstellar dispersion , and as a result , the higher frequencies of the signal traveling faster through the interstellar medium arrive earlier than their lower frequency counterparts . the time delay between the two frequencies @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 , ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is @xmath13   \\left(\\frac{\\rm dm}{\\rm cm^{-3}~pc}\\right ) , \\label{timedelay}\\ ] ] where dm is the integrated number density of free electrons along the line of sight .",
    "this dispersion allows us to distinguish between astrophysical and terrestrial signals .",
    "it causes a quadratic sweep across the band and may be removed by appropriately shifting the frequency channels .",
    "each time series was dedispersed over a range of trial dm values using the dedisperse routine in sigproc . for this analysis ,",
    "we have searched dms in a range from @xmath14  @xmath5  pc .",
    "the wide range of dm makes the search sensitive to events that are highly dispersed .",
    "the trial dm step sizes used in the analysis were calculated using an algorithm , dedisperse_all , originally described by @xcite which accounts for the amount of pulse broadening caused by the size of the previous dm step and then determines the next trial dm . a total pulse width smearing due to the dm step in comparison to the value at the last dm",
    "is chosen to be @xmath15 ( see , ",
    "appendix ) .",
    "the total number of dms searched was 249 , as chosen optimally by this program . for the dm steps used in our analysis , the average s / n loss is @xmath16 for dms @xmath17  @xmath5  pc and for dms between @xmath18  @xmath5  pc , the average s / n loss is @xmath19 , calculated using equations 12 and 13 of @xcite .",
    "the dedisperse routine uses equation 1 to calculate the time delays for each test dm and applies to frequency channels and the samples from each channel are then averaged to form a dedispersed time series .",
    "in addition to this , it also performs zero - dm subtraction @xcite on the time series to remove any rfi at zero dm .",
    "each dedispersed time series corresponding to a particular trial dm was searched for transient events of different widths via the matched filtering technique for top - hat pulses implemented in the program seek .",
    "this simple algorithm , which is an implementation of the method described in @xcite , saves individual events that deviate by five standard deviations from the mean of the time series .",
    "a number of adjacent samples are added to search for pulses of different widths .",
    "each time series was smoothed 15 times , corresponding to a maximum smoothing of @xmath20 times the sampling interval , i.e. pulse widths out to 4.096  s. if a pulse is detected in more than one of the smoothed times series , only the highest s / n value is recorded . following @xcite , the number of independent trials @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of dm trials , @xmath23 is the number of samples in each dedispersed time series , and @xmath24 corresponds to number of matched - filter widths used .",
    "we find @xmath25 for our observation . for more details of this search method ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "@xcite have assessed the performance of the search algorithms commonly being used to discover frbs .",
    "the authors point out some important concerns where sensitivity to frbs is often unnecessarily reduced and that the single - pulse search routines within the dedisperse_all and seek packages were less efficient compared to heimdall and destroy packages ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on the simulations which used an injected signal of known strength , @xcite demonstrated that the recovered s / n for dedisperse_all and seek was a function of pulse phase .",
    "we apply these results into our analysis , as described in   4 .",
    "these dispersed pulses can be displayed graphically using the plotpulses program and the resulting single - pulse plot can be seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : j0837 - 4135example ] . in the dm histogram ,",
    "we are able to detect sources that emit many weak pulses .",
    "such sources might not be detectable in the bottom plot .",
    "conversely , the sources that emit only a few strong pulses may only be detectable in the bottom plot .",
    "often a peak in the dm histogram at low dms is seen which is indicative of rfi . in some cases ,",
    "rfi is seen at all dms for a certain time range which can further limit our ability to detect a transient event .",
    "this would happen if there is a strong source of rfi that causes the receiver to saturate or some other local interference that is so strong that it shows up at all dms for that time range .",
    "the single - pulse plots thus obtained were inspected manually ( e.g. by searching for a well - defined peak in the s / n versus dm plot , see fig .",
    "[ fig : j0837 - 4135example ] ) . for manual inspection",
    ", we restricted the s / n threshold to six in order to keep the number of potential candidates at a manageable level .        the event detected by @xcite",
    "was detected simultaneously in three beams and all of the other frbs were detected in only a single beam . a strong signal appearing in all 13 beams simultaneously showing a dispersive delay",
    "is considered to have a terrestrial or instrumental origin ( called perytons , @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of these events has been recently identified as coming from a microwave oven when its door is opened prematurely and if the telescope is at an appropriate relative angle at that time @xcite .",
    "we did not detect any such events in our analysis .",
    "we found a number of bursts with high s / n in all 13 beams but no dispersive delay in the frequency versus time plot .",
    "these events are sources of rfi which have near earth origin and are only active for a brief period of time .",
    "nearly @xmath26 of the data show s / n greater than six in more than five beams but do not show dispersive delay .",
    "we did not consider these candidates further in our analysis .",
    "the diagnostic plots obtained after applying all the detection criteria were manually examined to look for a strong signal corresponding to a peak in the s / n versus dm plot .",
    "such candidates are shortlisted and the detection is confirmed if the signal shows a sweep from high to low frequency across the observing bandwidth in the frequency versus time plot .",
    "brightness was not a criterion for being shortlisted and some candidates were confirmed as pulsars despite not being detectable in this plot . for frbs ,",
    "if a dispersive sweep is absent then it is deemed to be a `` false detection '' ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : falsefrb ] ) .",
    "a burst - like event was seen in one of the beams ( see a bright pulse in the lower plot of fig .  [",

    "as summarized in table  [ table : surveyfile ] , our single - pulse search resulted in the detection of 20 of the 42 pulsars detected in the original periodicity search by @xcite .",

    "although our analysis did not result in any new frb detections , it is important to consider the impact of this null result on the frb event rate , @xmath42 .",

    "the surveys were processed using different search algorithms and therefore the rates need to be modified following the results of @xcite in order to combine the individual event rates . as per the response curve shown in figure 1 of @xcite , we get the corrected s / n from the use of these algorithms by defining the efficiency factors , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for dedisperseall , we find @xmath59 and , for seek , @xmath60 the frb searches we consider in this analysis are the results of reprocessing the parkes multibeam ( pmps ) survey ( @xcite , used destroy ) , the ph survey ( this paper , used seek ) , the swinburne intermediate and high - latitude ( swin ) surveys ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , used dedisperseall ) , the htru high - latitude ( htru high ) survey ( @xcite , @xcite , used dedisperseall ) , and the htru mid - latitude ( htru mid ) survey ( @xcite , used heimdall ) .",
    "in addition to this , the htru surveys were carried out using the digital back - end , berkeley - princeton - swinburne recorder ( bpsr ) , whereas the older parkes surveys used the analogue filterbank ( afb ) . in order to compare all parkes surveys , the digitization loss factors ( @xmath61 ) depending on the back - end used need to be considered in our analysis .",
    "for afb , @xmath62 and for bpsr , @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "we then insert the efficiency factors into the minimum fluence equation calculated for each processed survey @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the system temperature , @xmath66 is the telescope gain , @xmath67 is number of polarizations , @xmath68 is the bandwidth , @xmath69 is either @xmath70 or @xmath71 depending the survey , and @xmath72 is the pulse width equal to the sampling time when calculating the minimum fluence .",
    "the htru mid - latitude survey has the lowest minimum fluence as can be seen in table  [ table : rates ] .",
    "the event rates of other surveys are scaled to this lowest @xmath73 which is the simplest model assuming a uniform distribution of standard - candle frbs in euclidean geometry .",

    "we now consider the impact of this assumption .",
    "the galactic effects such as dispersion in the ism , scattering in the ism , scintillation , and sky temperature can limit the sensitivity of a survey .",
    "following the discussion in @xcite about decreased sensitivity to frbs at @xmath75 , we compare the sensitivity based on sky coverage for the parkes surveys considered in our calculations .",
    "the non - galactic dm contribution at high latitudes range between 520 and 1070  @xmath76 .",
    "the galactic dispersion at these latitudes is only about 50  @xmath5  pc , whereas the average galactic dispersion at intermediate latitudes and near the galactic center are 380  @xmath5  pc and 1780  @xmath5  pc respectively .",
    "the frb pulses with an additional non - galactic dm contribution at these lower latitudes would still be recovered in the surveys considered above as they have been searched to a sufficient dm , with the maximum trial dm in each of these surveys being @xmath77  @xmath5  pc .",
    "the average sky temperature values for four of these surveys range between 0.85  k to 3.18  k and about 6.14  k for the pmps survey @xcite .",
    "sky temperature is therefore not a significant factor in limiting the sensitivity when comparing these surveys .",
    "frbs discovered so far ( except frb  110220 ) show few effects of scattering ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite determined that more than @xmath78 of survey pointings in the intermediate latitude survey are still sensitive to frb signals even in the presence of strong scattering in the ism near the galactic center .",
    "this percentage will differ for afb surveys as the number of channels , sampling time , and digitization factors are different but is still small compared to overall uncertainty in the frb event rate at this point .",
    "@xcite analyzed how the combination of these effects limits sensitivity for survey pointings and determined that a simulated frb pulse with properties similar to the frbs in @xcite falls below the detection threshold in only @xmath79 of all intermediate latitude pointings assuming no scattering in the ism .",
    "we combine the individual rates since the sensitivity variations between afb and bpsr are within the uncertainty of rate of frbs .",
    "@xcite argue that since the percentage of pointings no longer sensitive to frb pulses decreases to @xmath79 , the null result is discrepant with the original predictions based on a higher event rate .",
    "although , if the event rate of frbs is much lower than previous estimates , it still explains the null result at intermediate latitudes ( table 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we argue that the lack of detections at intermediate latitudes and the null result in our analysis of a high - latitude survey are likely to be due to a lower frb rate and does not necessarily imply a dearth of frbs at intermediate latitudes .",
