    "a few years ago it was believed that the `` @xmath7 process '' was essentially clarified .",
    "it had been understood many years before that the distribution of @xmath7-elements in the solar system required multi - modal neutron exposures @xcite , generated in different astrophysical sites .",
    "main _ component ( accounting for nuclei from sr to pb ) had been attributed to stars climbing for the second time along the red giant branch in a phase called asymptotic giant branch , or agb @xcite , while a _ weak _ component ( explaining nuclei up to the @xmath15 = 50 magic neutron number ) had been ascribed to massive stars , during core - he and shell - c burning @xcite .",
    "recent work on the weak component showed that this process is complex and strongly dependent on reaction rate uncertainties affecting @xmath2-captures ( especially the @xmath16c+@xmath2 reaction ) , the @xmath16c+@xmath16c fusion and neutron captures on nuclei immediately beyond iron .",
    "hence , final results for the weak @xmath7-component must necessarily wait for new measurements and might , in the mean time , profit of any improvement in the constraints from the main component .",
    "a third , _ strong _ component , originally devised to account for 50% of the @xmath17pb concentration @xcite was recognized to be unnecessary @xcite , as its role could actually be played by agb stars at low metallicity , where the scarcity of iron nuclei implies that the number of neutrons per iron seed easily becomes sufficiently large to feed pb .",
    "this passage from the main to the strong component in agb stars is gradual and depends on the efficiency of the neutron release , so that heavy nuclei become progressively more enriched for decreasing metal content @xcite .",
    "a series of works presented in the last twenty years also clarified that the main component produced by agb stars is due to the activation of the @xmath1c(@xmath2,n)@xmath3o  source and ( more marginally ) of the @xmath18ne(@xmath2,n)@xmath19 mg  source @xcite .",
    "evidence on the minor role of the @xmath18ne(@xmath2,n)@xmath19 mg  reaction was provided by the abundances of neutron - rich , stable isotopes of heavy elements in the solar system ( especially @xmath20kr and @xmath21zr ) .",
    "indeed , when the neutron release from the @xmath18ne(@xmath2,n)@xmath19 mg  reaction was allowed to increase ( a fact that requires relatively high temperatures , i.e. @xmath22 k ) , excessive production of these nuclei invariably resulted @xcite .",
    "another constraint pointing to the same direction came from the rb / zr ratios in carbon stars @xcite .",
    "this suggested that the parent stars had to be of relatively low mass , i.e. @xmath23 @xmath5 , because for this mass range the typical temperature in the pulses barely reaches @xmath24 k. in these stars , thermonuclear combustion in the he - burning shell is activated in short , explosive bursts ( _ thermal pulses _ ) , during which an intermediate convective zone forms in the he - rich layers ; these bursts are separated by long intervals ( several 10@xmath25 yr ) , called _ interpulse _ periods , where the @xmath1c(@xmath2,n)@xmath3o  source releases its neutrons and produces @xmath7-elements ( see reviews in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    even now",
    ", the above scenario is not exempt from weak points .",
    "in particular , the activation of the @xmath1c(@xmath2,n)@xmath3o  neutron source requires unclear partial mixing mechanisms injecting protons into the he - rich layers during the downward envelope expansion called _ third dredge - up _ ( tdu ) , occurring after advanced thermal pulses .",
    "the lack of knowledge on these phenomena forced researchers to parameterize the amount of @xmath1c  available in a relatively free way .",
    "the scenario outlined above was subsequently put in question by chemical evolution models of @xmath7-elements in the galaxy by @xcite .",
    "these authors could not obtain , from the integrated galactic production , the good fit to the main @xmath7-process component previously envisaged on the basis of a single agb model for a low mass star ( lms ) of a suitable metallicity . the galactic production reconstructed using nuclear yields from agb models with a rather small ( @xmath26 @xmath5 ) @xmath1c - pocket turned out to be insufficient to account for the solar abundances of n - rich elements with atomic mass numbers between 86 and 130 . in a recent work",
    "@xcite confirm these results adopting a @xmath1c - pocket extension in the range from 2.5@xmath2710@xmath28 to 2@xmath2710@xmath29 @xmath5 .",
    "very recently , observations of @xmath7-process abundances were obtained for a large sample of galactic open clusters , first for ba @xcite , then also for y , zr , la and ce @xcite . as the age of an open cluster can be determined accurately , the above authors could trace , for the first time , the evolution of @xmath7-elements in the galactic disk directly as a function of time .",
    "this allowed them to observe an unexpected growth of @xmath7-element abundances in young stars of the galaxy .",
    "subsequent works on open clusters by @xcite , performed with different analysis methods , confirmed that such an increase is in general real ( although for elements like zr and la further investigations are needed ) .",
    "another piece of evidence in the same direction came from a complementary study by @xcite , who found @xmath7-element abundances increasing with time in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy .",
    "they showed that the traditional slow neutron - capture nucleosynthesis scenario fails to reproduce the observed trend , which instead requires a larger neutron inventory in agb stars .",
    "this confirms a recent proposal by @xcite ; they suggested that the @xmath1c  reservoir formed at tdu be considerably larger than previously adopted , at least in agb stars of very low mass ( @xmath30 @xmath5 ) . with this assumption and a chemical evolution model for the galaxy",
    ", they could reproduce very well the abundances observed in open clusters .",
    "another source of doubts on the traditional way of modeling the @xmath7-process emerged recently , this time from the theoretical side . in a paper by @xcite",
    "it was shown that , by including rotation in stellar modeling , any partial mixing at the convective border ( like those previously invoked for forming a _ small _",
    "@xmath1c  pocket ) become affected by the goldreich@xmath31schubert@xmath31fricke instability , forcing a more complete mixing .",
    "hence , at hydrogen shell re - ignition , any layer affected by the penetration of envelope material becomes dominated not by @xmath1c , but by @xmath6n , which is an efficient neutron poison and would strongly reduce the @xmath7-process efficiency .",
    "this confirms previous suggestions by @xcite and indicates that all previous attempts at modelling the @xmath1c  pocket formation through a small ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) exponential penetration of protons below the envelope border @xcite would be no longer acceptable .",
    "notice that in any case , this proton penetration had already the critical property of being dependent on the tdu phenomenon , being a downward partial extension of it .",
    "this induced in any case a limit on the @xmath1c  pocket formation , as it could occur only after pulses followed by tdu , i.e. in rather advanced stages of the agb .    in this paper",
    "we want to re - analyze the rather confused situation , which emerged from the above discoveries , by ascertaining : i ) if the hypothesis of a @xmath1c  pocket substantially larger than imagined in the past years is compatible with a reproduction of the @xmath32 distribution of @xmath7-elements in the solar main component ( as the * ? ? ?",
    "* paper only verified this point for y , zr , ba , la , ce ) .",
    "ii ) if one can imagine forms of deep mixing alternative to the partial extension of the envelope , in order to suggest ways for putting the formation of the @xmath1c  pocket on safer grounds ; and iii ) if an analysis of the solar - system main @xmath7-process component can constrain the extension of the layers partially polluted by protons at tdu , where @xmath1c  is expected to form .    in section 2",
    "we present some simple ideas aimed at setting the stage for a physical modeling of the @xmath1c  pocket . in section 3 we discuss recent improvements in the nuclear inputs , both for neutron - capture cross sections and for the rates of the neutron - producing reactions . in section 4",
    "we describe our computations for @xmath7 processing in low - mass agb models at suitably - chosen metallicities , supposed to represent an average of the @xmath7-processing efficiency over the evolution of the galaxy . in this way we adopt , for the sake of comparison , two widely different extensions for the @xmath1c  pocket ( in the range of those so far proposed by different authors ) .",
    "this is aimed at understanding how these results compare with the solar distribution , an issue that is discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we discuss the implications of the results found and we suggest some observational and theoretical tests that should help saying a final word on the @xmath1c  formation in agb stars .",
    "we shall try here to argue in favor of the existence of a @xmath1c  reservoir in he - rich layers , despite the doubts recently advanced on the poorly known physics of the convective border at tdu .",
    "one can rely for this purpose on very old ( but seminal and too often forgotten ) discussions of gas and plasma physics in stars , by s. chapman , t.g .",
    "cowling and e.n .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that , when in a stellar layer a suitable `` engine '' exists ( i.e. a local extra - source of heating , which adds to the general energy production sited deep in the star ) , then the mechanical behavior of that region will depend on how its temperature drops with the radius .",
    "parker noticed that sufficiently far from the input energy source , considerations on the heat flow require that : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radius within which all the extra - energy is provided ( see equation 3 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "he also showed , from heat exchange considerations ( equation 1 in the quoted paper ) , that @xmath35 must be positive .",
    "the mentioned paper considered a gas of pure hydrogen , but its results have a general application , and @xmath35 must be positive also for gases made by admixtures of heavier ions .",
    "this is shown in detail in @xcite , especially in chapter 18 ( integrated by equation 12.1.i of the same book ) .",
    "this generalization is crucial for us , in view of the fact that , below tdu , the material we deal with is mainly made of @xmath36he and @xmath16c .",
    "as @xcite showed , equation ( 1 ) with @xmath37 0 is not compatible with a hydrostatic solution , so that the material is in a state of _ natural _ expansion .",
    "( by applying these ideas to the hot solar corona , parker then gave the first quantitative physical basis to the existence of the solar wind : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we can now notice that the temperature condition for parker s solution , i.e. @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , holds also in the agb layers of our interest , during tdu .",
    "this is shown in figure 1 , where we plotted the behavior of pressure , density and temperature for the mentioned zones of a 1.5 @xmath5  model by @xcite , during the fourth tdu ( the trends plotted are actually typical of all agb stars in the mass range from 1 to about 3 @xmath5 ) .",
    "as is clear from the third panel , the temperature decreases with radius less rapidly than @xmath40 ( the actual exponent varying between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .    in the above conditions , _",
    "if there is an extra source of energy acting at the base _ , the overlying zones can be put in an expanding motion with respect to the environment , due to the parker s mechanism .",
    "( notice that the he - rich layers are _ already _ expanding as a consequence of the nuclear energy input introduced shortly before tdu by the occurrence of a thermal pulse ) .    ) , density ( @xmath43 ) and temperature ( @xmath44 ) distributions as a function of radius in the _ intershell _ region of a star with 1.5 @xmath5  and solar metallicity .",
    "the physical quantities are normalized to their values at the bottom of the he - rich region .",
    "the top and the middle panel jointly show that the stellar structure is a polytrope ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the red and full lines are the best fits to the @xmath46 and @xmath43 trends found in the stellar model , respectively . in the lowest panel ,",
    "the blue - dashed line is a guide to the eye",
    ". the temperature decreases less rapidly than @xmath47 over the whole layer of interest , thus satisfying the conditions required by parker .",
    "the formulae describing the fitting lines are shown at the upper right corner of each panel .",
    "all quantities are divided by the corresponding values ( with subscript index `` @xmath48 '' ) at the layer just above the c - o core.(a color version of this figure is available in the online journal . ) ]    let s now consider a rotating agb star , with a rigid - body inner degenerate core and an intermediate , differentially - rotating layer below a convective envelope .",
    "this structure can power a magnetic dynamo @xcite , suitable to induce the buoyancy of magnetized domains that reach the envelope @xcite , as it actually occurs in the sun @xcite .",
    "motivations in favor of magnetic buoyancy as a source of non - convective mixing have been presented elsewhere for h - rich layers @xcite and will not be repeated here .    a further energy input is then provided by the formation of toroidal magnetic fields near the border of the rigid - body core by a dynamo mechanism @xcite . in the magnetized regions thus formed ( which will in general occupy a fraction @xmath49 of the total mass of a stellar layer of radius @xmath50 )",
    "the extra - source of energy will be the magnetic energy density , i.e. the magnetic pressure , equal ( in cgs units ) to @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the magnetic field in the magnetized zones at the layer @xmath50 ) .",
    "several papers then described the _ relative _ buoyancy of magnetized structures ( usually , magnetic flux tubes ) with respect to an underlying , non - magnetized gas ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case buoyant flux tubes crossing the convective envelope border",
    "thanks to the extra - energy provided by magnetic pressure would behave somehow similarly to the solar wind , because the conditions set by @xcite and @xcite are satisfied .",
    "one can then express the rate of buoyancy for the magnetized mass crossing a stellar surface at radius @xmath50 as : @xmath53 conservation of the rising mass would yield @xmath54 = const .",
    "conservation of mass across the convective border would instead guarantee that a downward flux of envelope material occurs , with 71% in mass of protons ( for a solar composition ) .",
    "this will not be due to some dubious , spontaneous smoothing of the convective velocity profile , but to a _ forced _",
    "process , the `` engine '' residing down near the degenerate core , rooted in a magnetic dynamo .",
    "this is promising : measurements of @xmath55 ( from which the rising velocity will depend ) might in a near future fix the mass circulation , hence the amount of protons penetrating downward . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath1c  pocket might be fixed consequently .",
    "ours is not a demonstration : it can not be , without a quantitative , detailed magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) modeling . however , we believe that our suggestion may deserve further scrutiny with detailed models , as mhd might provide the required forcing term , suitable to push down from the envelope into the radiative layers , for mass conservation , the protons we need for forming the @xmath1c  pocket .    one has to notice that the material pushed down from the envelope must move against a pressure and density gradient . quite generally , this will lead to a decrease in the penetrated mass with distance , as the environment will provide a gradual extinction for the flow .",
    "if this can be expressed via a constant extinction coefficient @xmath2 ( depending on viscosity , on the degree of thermalization , etc ... ) then the problem can be treated similarly to any transport process .",
    "calling @xmath56 the mass that can travel downwards a length @xmath57 inside the he - rich layers , one has : @xmath58 if the forced penetration reaches down to a depth @xmath50 and if the base of the envelope is sited at the radius @xmath59 , then for any injection of a mass @xmath60 at @xmath59 integration of equation ( 3 ) yields : @xmath61 this assumes @xmath2 to be approximated by a constant .",
    "it is however plausible that the viscosity and the pressure gradient grow with the distance from the envelope ; then the corresponding @xmath62 would also grow and the mass profile of the penetrating material would be steeper than a simple exponential . for our merely illustrative purposes we can stick to the simple case of equation ( 4 ) .",
    "notice that the mhd hypothesis does not enter into equation ( 4 ) .",
    "that idea is promising , but it serves us only to make plausible that a @xmath1c  pocket can in fact be produced in galactic disk agb stars , to compensate the problems now emerging in the traditional approach ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* in particular table 2 and section 5 ) , by a forced mechanism , and can for this reason be larger than so far adopted . from this point of view , other mechanisms might exist to serve the same purpose .",
    "perhaps another promising example would be the wave - like form of mixing suggested by @xcite .",
    "the important point is that , for explaining a large @xmath1c  reservoir , one should look for a @xmath63 process , not a @xmath64 one .    for the sake of comparison with previous works , we shall assume , for the moment , that the extension of the @xmath1c  pocket , ensuing from a forced mechanism of the kind qualitatively motivated above , be either similar to the one adopted by @xcite , or much larger , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "these last authors derived , from chemical evolution models for the galaxy , the requirement for a pocket extension in mass from 3 to 8 times larger than before ( depending on which of the older models is assumed as a comparison ) .",
    "we shall adopt here , as an example , a pocket of 6@xmath65 @xmath5 .",
    "notice that this means polluting with protons almost the entire extension of the he - rich layers , as required by physical mechanisms driven by buoyancy from the levels where a dynamo is established .    for the pocket used in traditional models we chose an extension aimed at representing a sort of average among the many cases previously considered .",
    "our choice is larger than in @xcite ; it is similar to that of case a in the recent paper by @xcite and is only a factor - of - two smaller than for their maximum extension .",
    "concerning the total mass of @xmath1c  available for burning , in the smaller pocket adopted by us for comparison this is about @xmath66 @xmath5 .",
    "figure 2 , instead , shows the abundances in the more extended pocket of our second hypothesis , after h - shell reignition .",
    "the pocket itself was obtained by introducing mass from the envelope with the parameter @xmath2 of equation ( 3 ) set to reproduce the proton penetration suggested by @xcite ; it extends by about 6@xmath65 @xmath5 .",
    "it contains 4.2@xmath67 @xmath5  of @xmath1c , almost entirely confined in the first 4@xmath68 @xmath5 .",
    "the extension is more than a factor of 3 larger than the largest case discussed by @xcite .",
    "notice that these authors find the pocket extension to be irrelevant for the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "however the maximum abundance of @xmath1c  they considered does not exceed 1.1@xmath2710@xmath69 @xmath5 , a value that is a factor of four smaller than our case of figure 2 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that @xcite did not find any significant difference as compared to older models by @xcite .    in our approach ,",
    "the extension of the pocket is a direct consequence of the physical structure of the star and the abundances in it are constrained by the rates for proton captures .",
    "the forced mechanism `` from bottom to top '' we consider will cover most of the he - rich layers and will therefore fix , for each stellar mass and metallicity , essentially an unique value for the number of neutrons produced , we notice that this fact avoids a free parameterization , often introduced by allowing each stellar model at each mass and metallicty to host a range of different @xmath7-process efficiencies @xcite .    as is clear from figure 2 , the upper part of the reservoir , initially containing more protons , gets enriched in the neutron - poison @xmath6n , while in the inner part @xmath1c dominates .",
    "this second region is where most @xmath7-elements are produced , while the upper part is especially important for the complex nucleosynthesis network starting from @xmath6n , feeding @xmath70n , @xmath71f and @xmath72na @xcite .",
    "the contribution of this upper layer to the @xmath7-process is smaller , as only about 30% of the neutrons are saved to be captured by heavy seeds .",
    "nevertheless , this zone is very important for the solar distribution : as an example , when the @xmath1c - rich layer is suitable to feed nuclei near the @xmath73 peak ( e.g ba ) , this zone rich in @xmath6n will mainly feed the lighter @xmath7-elements , like sr and zr : considering it properly and is therefore crucial for the synthesis of nuclei below a = 100 or so .",
    "c pocket formed according to the model described in the text .",
    "the mass extension is @xmath74 @xmath5  .",
    "it is more extended by a factor from 3 to 8 with respect to cases common in the previous decades @xcite . from the outside towards the inside of the star ( or equivalently from left to right in the figure ) we obtain first a region where @xmath6n ( red dot - dashed line ) dominates , then a second layer ( green - shaded in the figure ) where the @xmath1c abundance prevails .",
    "( a color version of this figure is available in the online journal . ) ]",
    "as mentioned , the @xmath75 reaction is the dominant source of neutrons for the production of the @xmath7-process main component in low - mass stars .",
    "there is a vast literature on this reaction , as it presents challenging experimental problems .",
    "the main one concerns the presence of a subthreshold resonance at @xmath76 kev in the center - of - mass system corresponding to the excited 1/2@xmath77 state of @xmath78o .",
    "direct measurements have been so far possible down to 270 kev ; below this energy only theoretical extrapolations are available .",
    "the gamow window lays in the range 140 @xmath31 230 kev , where the astrophysical @xmath79-factor is dominated by the subthreshold resonance .",

    "in order to compare the predictions from models adopting the two different @xmath112c pockets discussed in section 2 , we performed @xmath7-process nucleosynthesis calculations through our post - process code _ nucleosynthesis of elements with transfer of neutrons _ ( newton ) , which is an upgrade of the one adopted in @xcite .",
    "it includes a detailed network of more than 400 isotopes ( from he to bi ) connected by @xmath2- , @xmath113- and @xmath35-captures and weak interactions .",
    "the stellar evolutionary models for lms in the agb stages were taken from the franec prescriptions @xcite .    when ( for the sake of comparison ) we deal with a pocket similar to those from @xcite , we need to adopt all the choices ( e.g. the large number of thermal pulses ) that were essential parts of that scenario , as summarized by @xcite . in the discussion of the new assumptions for the pocket",
    ", we can instead adopt a more modern view , which is now incorporated also in the franec code @xcite .",
    "this view descends from the recent infrared analysis of agb stars @xcite . in those works",
    "it was shown that efficient mass loss prevents the agb luminosities to attain values larger than about 10@xmath114 , thus implying a lower number of pulses than in previous models .",
    "revisions of the opacities now also guarantee a larger efficiency of tdu episodes . as a consequence ,",
    "the total amount of processed matter is about the same as before , but the present models now reproduce theoretically the luminosity function ( lf ) of c stars",
    ". there might be actually a slight overestimate of mass loss rates in the new cases as computed by franec ( guandalini , private communication ) , so that we perform @xmath7-process calculations for 3 @xmath31 4 pulses more than reported in the on - line repository of the franec data ( _ http://fruity.oa-teramo.inaf.it _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using the parameters of the last pulse computed . with the above approach ,",
    "a  new \" 1.5 @xmath5  case experiences 8 pulses less than in the choices by @xcite .    in our lms models ,",
    "the @xmath75 reaction is activated in radiative conditions ( at about 8 kev ) , during the periods between two subsequent convective instabilities . except for rare situations occurring at very low metallicity",
    ", @xmath112c is consumed locally , before the onset of the subsequent pulse .",
    "the two stellar evolution scenarios we discuss here for @xmath7-processing differ only for : i ) the temperature of thermal pulses , which is slightly lower in the new cases ; and ii ) the number of pulses and the corresponding tdu efficiencies , as explained above .",
    "the cumulative effects induced by these differences on the final yields are very small , so that any change emerging in the final production factors can be safely interpreted as due primarily to the different extensions of the pocket in the two cases .",
    "as mentioned , for the old cases , we adopt a pocket of 10@xmath29 @xmath5 .",
    "as a consequence of p - captures in those layers , the resulting integrated amount of @xmath112c available for producing neutrons is about @xmath66 @xmath5 . with this @xmath1c  abundance",
    "the yields of lms mimic the solar distribution at about [ fe / h ] @xmath115 ; the distributions one can find in this way ( see later figure 5 ) are very similar to that by @xcite and the accuracy is roughly the same .",
    "we notice that this is not much different from the recent results by @xcite , who indeed continue to depict a scenario for @xmath7-processing incapable of explaining the light @xmath7-elements and incapable of reproducing the abundances in open clusters .",
    "their models are therefore , in the present context , not much different that the older ones we quoted",
    ". we shall refer to the calculations performed with the above assumptions as to  case a \" . when adopting the larger @xmath1c - reservoir , we base our analysis on the previous calculations by @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the bulk of the @xmath7-process abundances now seen in the galaxy was produced by agb stars with metallicity with a small range ( [ fe / h ] @xmath116 to @xmath117 ) ; the value [ fe / h ] @xmath116 is adopted here . in this case",
    "the choice for the pocket is that presented in figure 2 and extends almost to the whole he - rich layers .",
    "we shall refer to the calculations performed with these assumptions as to  case b \" .    for both choices of the pocket , we computed the outcomes of @xmath7-process nucleosynthesis in model stars of 1.5 , 2.0 and 3.0 @xmath5 . in the calculations we used the compilation of solar abundances from @xcite , implying @xmath118 .",
    "a subset of results ( relative to the extreme cases of 1.5 and 3.0 @xmath5  models ) are shown in figures 5 and 6 , for case a and case b , respectively .",
    "these data represent the production factors @xmath119 in the he - rich region at the last computed thermal pulse , for the nuclei in the atomic mass range @xmath120 , with respect to the initial abundances . for comparison ,",
    "the production factors are normalized to the mean value of those @xmath7-only nuclei that are not affected by branchings ( in figures 5 and 6 we use @xmath121 to refer to `` * * s**-**o**nly nuclei * * w**ithout * * b**ranchings '' ) .",
    "this means that ratios of unity indicate the exact level necessary to fit the solar system distribution of @xmath7-only nuclei .",
    "the choices discussed above also imply that a flat distribution for all @xmath7-only nuclei corresponds to a good average model for the main @xmath7 component . to guide the eye , a tolerance region of @xmath122 10%",
    "is indicated by the red dashed lines in figures 5 and 6 .    the enhancement factors with respect to the initial composition found at the last computed pulse of each model",
    "was then weighted using the value of the salpeter s initial mass function ( imf ) corresponding to the stellar mass and summed with those from the other masses .",
    "the result was then normalized , again by dividing for the average over - production of @xmath7-only nuclei unaffected by reaction branchings , in order to construct the ( weighted and normalized ) average production from the whole mass range .",
    "the results of the averaging procedure are shown in figure 7 for case a and case b , respectively .",
    "they are similar to the results shown in figures 5 and 6 for 1.5 @xmath5  models ; this is obviously due to the weighting operation , as the imf favors lower masses .",
    "we therefore confirm the common assumption that models for this stellar mass offer an average rather typical conditions for producing the main component .",
    "as already mentioned , the stellar models at the base of case a and case b are very similar ; in particular , the temperatures of the radiative layers where most of the neutron flux is released are essentially the same .",
    "as also the nuclear parameters adopted are the same , any difference is due primarily to the extension of the @xmath112c reservoir .    in figures from 5 to 7 we used different symbols ( and different colors in the electronic version ) to distinguish the isotopes",
    "according to the so - far expected percentage production by slow neutron captures ( see the legends in the figures ) .",
    "a vertical dashed line was drawn to indicate the starting point for the main component , conventionally defined at @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "-only nuclei plotted in figure 7 for cases b and a. while both models are in fair agreement in the mass range @xmath124 , the case with the more extended @xmath112c pocket yields large contributions to nuclei below @xmath125 90 , thus providing expectations for the weak @xmath7-process component in massive stars.(a color version of this figure is available in the online journal . ) ]    a direct comparison between the panels of figure 7 immediately highlights that the two distributions differ significantly only outside the atomic mass limits of the main component ( i.e. for a @xmath126 90 and a @xmath127 204 ) .",
    "this result is in itself remarkable .",
    "it means that , by using a large @xmath1c  pocket , already suitable to account for the trend of @xmath7-process abundances in the galactic disk , up to the youngest clusters , it is also possible to reproduce quite well the solar distribution and in the mean time to incorporate the upgrades on agb modeling necessary to account for the lf of agb stars .",
    "the differences between the two sets of results are summarized in the ratios of the production factors for the @xmath7-only nuclei , as plotted in figure 8 .",
    "again , the vertical dashed line represents the a @xmath128 90 starting point of the main component , while the red horizontal dashed lines identify a 10% fiducial interval .",
    "this is the typical level of the experimental uncertainties on the points to be fitted , when one considers both abundances and nuclear parameters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as one can notice , for a @xmath129 90 the situation is virtually the same and the ratios differ from unity only by a few percent .",
    "an apparent exception is seen at @xmath130pb , but it only derives from the fact that the ratio emphasizes small differences pointing to opposite sides of the average level .    on the contrary , for a @xmath131 90 case b",
    "feeds more efficiently the lighter ( or weak-@xmath7 ) elements , resulting in two to three times higher production factors .",
    "this point deserves some comments .",
    "as shown by @xcite , case a implies that agb nucleosynthesis becomes insufficient to explain the galactic enrichment of @xmath7-process nuclei below a @xmath132 100 @xmath31 120 and an unknown process , called solar @xmath9 ( light element primary production ) , must be invoked .",
    "consequently , predictions for the weak @xmath7-process contributed by massive stars can not be derived by our computations . for case b , instead , integrations from unknown processes are not needed @xcite , so that figure 7 can be used to predict the role played by massive stars in the synthesis of light @xmath7-nuclei .",
    "this role depends crucially on still poorly known nuclear parameters , especially the @xmath16c(@xmath2,@xmath104)@xmath3o rate ; hence , firm constraints from agb stars might serve as guidelines for the expectations on such parameters .",
    "we warn that the predictions for the weak component here derived depend on the mass of the @xmath1c - pocket , for which only an exemplifying average extension was chosen from @xcite .",
    "more precise indications should be derived with a dedicated analysis .    among the relevant properties of the abundance distribution for case",
    "b we underline the contributions to the the @xmath7-only isotopes of strontium , @xmath133sr .",
    "their production factors are increased by a factor of almost 3 with respect to case a and stay very close to the reference line of @xmath7-only nuclei produced by the main component . in our new scenario , therefore , the matching point between the @xmath7-element production from massive and agb stars would require to be moved downward , at the @xmath134kr branching ; @xmath133sr would in this case become full members of the main component .",
    "a further general property is that , due to the large neutron exposure , all nuclei near magic numbers are fed very efficiently .",
    "hence , the contribution by the @xmath7-process main component to @xmath12sr , @xmath13y and @xmath14zr becomes close to unity ( about 95% , 83% and 97% , respectively ) .",
    "the same effect is seen near the @xmath135 magic number , where @xmath136ba and @xmath137ce are now produced at the 88% and 92% level , respectively , by the @xmath7 process .",
    "@xmath138pb represents a special case , although it is not an @xmath7-only nucleus and therefore is not crucial for the solar - system @xmath7-element distribution .",
    "its @xmath7-process contribution does not come only from the main component , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "these authors also showed how its production from the so - called `` strong '' @xmath7-process component could be provided by low metallicity agb stars . in view of this crucial role of the metallicity dependence and of the fact that cases a and b",
    "have a different reference metallicity , the two production factors shown in figure 7 can not be compared directly , as the parent stars would have very different roles in the chemical evolution of the galaxy for lead . in this case the contributions of agb stars to the solar abundance can only be derived by galactic chemical evolution calculations .",
    "we conclude this section by summarizing the main results found here : i ) the solar distribution of @xmath7-process isotopes from zr to pb is mimicked well by nucleosynthesis calculations made for lms undergoing thermal pulses in agb phases .",
    "ii ) the metallicity at which the yields from agb stars best approach the distribution in the sun increases with the extension of the @xmath1c  pocket .",
    "iii ) if the pocket is sufficently large , the dominant metallicity is in the range typical of the most common galactic disk stars and the yields dominate the galactic enrichment integrating the weak @xmath7-process in massive stars .",
    "iv ) only for small extensions of the @xmath1c  pocket another independent nuclear process ( the solar @xmath9 ) is required to complement the agb production in the mass range 100 @xmath131 a @xmath131 120 .",
    "v ) constraints from stellar luminosities and from recent results on mixing at the envelope border @xcite play in favor of the scenario with the large pocket inferred by @xcite , which combines a limited number of pulse - interpulse cycles with a high processing efficiency and does not require any @xmath9 contribution .",
    "vi ) this new scenario foresees important contributions by agb stars to the light @xmath7-process nuclei of the weak @xmath7 component .",
    "in this paper we re - analyzed nucleosynthesis models for slow neutron captures in agb stars , after new observational as well as theoretical information shed doubts on the previous scenario for the formation of the @xmath1c  neutron source and for its actual extension . in our work",
    "we have argued that , even in presence of persisting uncertainties concerning the dynamical mechanisms promoting proton penetration into the he - rich layers at the convective border , stellar physics offers other , perhaps more secure , ways of generating transport phenomena suitable for forming a @xmath1c  reservoir and then inducing neutron - capture nucleosynthesis . in particular , we have suggested that a fruitful line of research may be that of describing , through a quantitative mhd treatment , the development of toroidal magnetic fields , induced by stellar dynamos , in the radiative he - rich layers below the convective envelope .",
    "the above scheme for the creation of a @xmath1c - rich layer foresees that the partially mixed zones extend down to very deep regions , essentially involving most of the he - rich layers of the agb star , due to the formation of buoyant magnetic structures close to the outer border of the degenerate c - o core .",
    "we have also underlined that any attempt at upgrading our present understanding of @xmath7-processing in low - mass agb stars must take into account the fact that the infrared lfs of these last agree with stellar model predictions only if the magnitudes remain moderate ( @xmath139 ) and hence the number of pulses undergone by the star is smaller than previously assumed @xcite .",
    "the above considerations imply that @xmath7-processing in agb stars is built in a way rather different than imagined so far , namely through a smaller number of pulse - interpulse cycles , each however experiencing a more efficient nucleosynthesis episode .",
    "as these required changes are also necessary to explain the increasing abundances of @xmath7-elements in the galactic disk @xcite , they seem to become mandatory . also , they can not be mimicked by increasing the abundance of @xmath1c  in a small pocket : the concentrations in mass of @xmath1c  and of @xmath6n in the reservoir formed are fixed by h - burning rates and can not be varied freely ( as is instead often done ) , without violating basic physical laws .",
    "we have then performed a comparison of the results achievable for reproducing the solar main component in two cases : i ) the scenario most commonly used in the last 20 years for dealing with s - processing , based on a small extension of the @xmath1c  reservoir ( that we called case a ) ; and ii ) the newly suggested one , with @xmath1c - rich layers reaching down to deep regions of the he - rich zone ( referred to as case b ) .",
    "the comparison has been performed by computing n - captures in stellar models of 1.5 , 2.0 and 3.0 @xmath5  and by averaging the @xmath7-process results after weighting by the imf of salpeter .",
    "the main result is that , if the metallicity for the two cases is chosen suitably , both provide a distribution of production factors mimicking the main @xmath7-process component . due to the different neutron capture efficiency resulting from the different extension of the @xmath1c  pocket ,",
    "the number of pulses differs in the two cases , much like the metallicity does : [ fe / h ] @xmath140 and n @xmath141 20 pulses for the old scenario , [ fe / h ] @xmath142 and n @xmath143 15 pulses for the new one .",
    "moreover , the main aim of the above test was to look for an answer to the question posed in the title : can we distinguish , from comparisons with solar abundances , which scenario has to be preferred ?",
    "in general , if one sticks to the results from a stellar generation at a suitably chosen metallicity then a decision is not possible , as the quality of the fits to the solar abundances of @xmath7-only nuclei shown in figure 7 is essentially identical .",
    "however , a closer look reveals remarkable differences in the predictions of the two cases for the nucleosynthesis of @xmath7-nuclei in the galaxy .",
    "this is already evident from figure 8 , if one considers light nuclei outside the limits of the main component ; but is true also for heavier isotopes , when one derives the consequences of the calculations for the chemical evolution of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "both issues are actually strictly connected as outlined in the following .",
    "let us show how .",
    "the reason for the different predictions from case a and case b at the lower mass end of the distribution ( requiring or not a solar @xmath9 process ) is rather simple .",
    "it can be illustrated with the help of the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) , which is reproduced in figure 9 from the results by @xcite .",
    "the two boxes represent the metallicity intervals over which the main component is best fitted in our case a and case b. for case a the amr is sampled over a short time interval , at epochs old enough that it is still far from the conditions prevailing over most of the galactic disk duration .",
    "the total number of stars in that short interval is therefore relatively small and the effects on galactic abundances will not be dominant .",
    "most agb stars will be born later , when the abundance of fe is higher . due to the small pocket",
    ", the number of neutrons per iron seed in them will be so small that their yields will be almost irrelevant in the global inventory of the galaxy .",
    "as , with low neutron exposures , they feed mainly light @xmath7-process nuclei , these last will be insufficiently produced , hence the requirement of a @xmath9 integration . on the contrary for case b the reference metallicity range , due to the large pocket , is shifted upward , to conditions typical of the main galactic disk population , lasting for several gyr . in this case the agb stars shown before to mimic the main component will be the dominant ones , sufficient in number and effectiveness for taking care of the galactic enrichment , so that no extra process is required .",
    "these are examples of a more general trend . essentially , by choosing adequately the metallicity and the @xmath1c  pocket extension , one can obtain production factors mimicking the solar distribution in generations of agb stars for any choice of the @xmath1c  reservoir .",
    "however , if we want that the chosen generation can process enough galactic material to be really dominant in the chemical evolution of the galaxy and in controlling solar abundances , then we must choose an effective average metallicity typical of the thin galactic disk , where the abundance evolution is low , long time scales are involved and the number of agbs contributing becomes huge . in that case , the abundance of iron is high and to have a sufficient number of neutrons per iron seed the @xmath1c  pocket must be quite extended in mass .",
    "this favors case b. obviously , case a can not be excluded on these grounds , but it would need a @xmath9 contribution . for case a , this means that searching for @xmath144 galactic conditions where the solar distribution is reproduced is not really meaningful .",
    "the above discussion gives us an opportunity to identify crucial tests that should be made , from which a conclusive judgement can be derived on the real extension of the @xmath1c  pocket ( hence also on its origin ) .",
    "we list below six such tests that are , in our opinion , especially suitable to provide a final answer .    * compute models using the case a choice for the pocket , but with a limited number of pulses ( thus reaching a luminosity compatible with present - day lfs ) , verifying whether a compromise can be found that fits the solar data without violating the prescriptions on c - star magnitudes .",
    "we believe this should be actually very difficult , given the shortage of neutrons ; but this is in any case a crucial test to be performed quantitatively .",
    "* compute galactic chemical evolution models including at least sr , ba and pb isotopes with the two scenarios and compare them with the observations ( which are unfortunately limited for pb abundances ) .",
    "very young stellar clusters ( absent in previous such studies by @xcite should be included .",
    "we expect that the models of case a will not reproduce the observations , while those of case b will ; but again this has to be demonstrated in detail .",
    "* verify whether , with an extended @xmath1c  pocket , one can reproduce the @xmath7/c ratios of post - agb stars , an achievement that proved impossible for the models of case a @xcite .",
    "* detailed , quantitative models ( based on mhd calculations or on other processes capable of forcing the formation of a @xmath1c  pocket ) should be developed to see what kind of mixing can be realistically expected . * the abundance pattern shown by presolar materials recovered in pristine meteorites should be compared with the predictions of the two scenarios , looking for more detailed constraints possibly coming from the isotopic admixtures measured in presolar grains .",
    "* when the chemical evolution of the galaxy is computed , models of case a were shown to require , for explaining the solar system abundances of @xmath7-elements up to a @xmath132 120 , the contribution of the unknown solar @xmath9 process @xcite .",
    "this is not necessarily coincident with the process required at low metallicity , see e.g. @xcite . from the tests made on crucial elements by @xcite we know this is not needed by the new models of case b.",
    "now a critical point is : can the approach of case a , plus a unique choice for the lepp contribution , explain the increased abundances of @xmath7 elements in young galactic stellar systems ?",
    "an answer can come from fixing the lepp contributions from solar constraints , then verifying if this is sufficient for explaining the increased abundances in young clusters .",
    "again we predict that this procedure should fail and the results by @xcite seem to point in that direction .",
    "however they do not consider the open cluster problem directly , so that a dedicated calculation must be done before a final decision is taken .",
    "the information we can get from performing the above tests would be decisive .",
    "should the new models , with an extended @xmath1c  pocket and a limited number of pulses , prevail ( as it may seem probable now , given the larger number of constraints they appear to match ) then some general conclusions on @xmath7-processing should be revised . in particular :",
    "i ) the main component should be considered as including @xmath11sr completely ; ii ) the expectations for @xmath17pb in low metallicity stars would be different and probably less extreme ; iii ) the @xmath7-process contribution to nuclei like @xmath12sr , @xmath13y , @xmath14zr , @xmath136ba and @xmath137ce should be revised upward and accepted to reach 90 @xmath31 100% of their abundance ; iv ) in view of the expected new measurements for the rates of the @xmath16c(@xmath93)@xmath3o and of the @xmath16c+@xmath16c fusion reactions , new determinations of @xmath7-processing in massive stars should verify the new suggestions from agb models for nuclei below a@xmath145 90 .",

    "<S> slow neutron captures at @xmath0 are mainly guaranteed by the reaction @xmath1c(@xmath2,n)@xmath3o  in agb stars , requiring proton injections from the envelope . </S>",
    "<S> these were so far assumed to involve a small mass ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) , but models with rotation suggest that in such tiny layers excessive @xmath6n hampers @xmath7-processing . furthermore , @xmath7-element abundances in galaxies require @xmath1c - rich layers substantially extended in mass ( @xmath8 @xmath5 ) . we therefore present new calculations aiming at clarifying those issues and at understanding if the solar composition helps to constrain the @xmath1c  `` pocket '' extension . </S>",
    "<S> we show : i ) that mixing `` from bottom to top '' ( like in magnetic buoyancy or other forced mechanisms ) can form a @xmath1c  reservoir substantially larger than assumed so far , covering most of the he - rich layers ; ii ) that stellar models at a fixed metallicity , based on this idea reproduce the main @xmath7-component as accurately as before ; iii ) that they make nuclear contributions from unknown nucleosynthesis processes ( @xmath9 ) unnecessary , against common assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> these models also avoid problems of mixing at the envelope border and fulfil requirements from c - star luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> they yield a large production of nuclei below @xmath10 , so that @xmath11sr may be fully synthesized by agb stars , while @xmath12sr , @xmath13y and @xmath14zr are contributed more efficiently than before . </S>",
    "<S> we finally suggest tests suitable to say a final word on the extension of the @xmath1c  pocket . </S>"
