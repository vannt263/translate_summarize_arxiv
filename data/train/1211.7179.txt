    "the perovskite oxide , lavo@xmath12 , shows the giant diamagnetism @xcite . the magnetization obtained under field - cooling",
    "( fc ) condition becomes largely negative when the applied field is below 0.2 t or a little higher ; the @xmath13 value at 0.02 t , for example , is about @xmath14 emu / mol .",
    "the temperature dependence of magnetization under zero - fc ( zfc ) condition shows the conventional behavior of an antiferromagnet with the peak at @xmath1 k @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , fc data have an unusual enhancement around @xmath9 and a sharp drop below @xmath2 k. the canted antiferromagnetic ( af ) state has been confirmed below @xmath8 @xcite and suggested between @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "obviously the enhancement is the key to understand the giant diamagnetism .",
    "nevertheless , there is no report on whether the spontaneous magnetization appears between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the study on the magnetism of the compound is not sufficient although a large number of reports on it have been published .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show the magnetic data , which will be useful to elucidate the magnetism in future .",
    "the powder sample of lavo@xmath12 was obtained by reduction of lavo@xmath15 in h@xmath16 gas at 1200for overnight .",
    "then , the sample was annealed in flowing ar gas at 1200for overnight .",
    "the oxygen content of the final product was estimated from the weight increase after firing the sample at 600 in air .",
    "the exact composition of the sample is lavo@xmath17 .",
    "lavo@xmath15 was prepared from the stoichiometric mixture of la@xmath16o@xmath12 and v@xmath16o@xmath18 at 600for overnight and then 650for overnight .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed on mpms - xl ( quantum design ) .",
    "the magnetization curves at various temperatures were measured from 7 t to @xmath19 t with the intervals of 0.2 t down to 1 t and of 0.05 t below 1 t. to obtain each magnetization curve , the sample was once heated at 160 k , and the magnetic field of 7 t was applied there . then the sample was cooled down under the field to a target temperature to start magnetization measurement .",
    "two sets of the measurements of the magnetization curves were performed using two samples , which were taken from a single batch of the sample .",
    "they were named run 1 and run 2 , which agree well with each other . in this paper , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23",
    "represent magnetization , magnetic field , magnetic susceptibility , and temperature , respectively .",
    "magnetization curve between 0.1 t and 1 t at each temperature was fit by the linear function of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization is shown in fig .",
    "there are four characteristic temperatures of @xmath0 k , @xmath2 k , @xmath3 k , and @xmath4 k. the spontaneous magnetization appears below @xmath5 , and it develops up to @xmath26 @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "below @xmath8 the spontaneous magnetization decreases steeply , but it starts to increase again at around @xmath10 .",
    "the small drop of the spontaneous magnetization happens at @xmath11 .",
    "obviously the enhancement between @xmath5 and @xmath8 indicates that magnetic ordering occurs at @xmath5 , not @xmath9 , because the spontaneous magnetization never appear in a paramagnetic state .",
    "the @xmath25 values above 148 k are constant at approximately @xmath27 @xmath7 , which was likely caused by inevitable inaccuracy of the magnetic field .",
    "so , the spontaneous magnetization at @xmath8 may be estimated to be approximately @xmath28 @xmath7 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization is concave or linear just below @xmath5 , which is quite unusual for conventional canted antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "usually it is convex because it corresponds to the temperature dependence of the magnetization of each magnetic sublattice , which is the order parameter of the magnetic transition .",
    "temperature dependence of spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the red and blue data were obtained by run 1 and run 2 , respectively . ]    the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility is shown in fig .",
    "[ chit ] , together with that of magnetization under fc and zfc conditions at @xmath29 t and 1 t. it agrees well with @xmath13-@xmath23 curves under zfc condition , not those under fc condition , although the magnetization curves were obtained under fc condition . they all show the unusual peak at @xmath9 ; since the magnetic susceptibility here corresponds to the ac susceptibility at the lowest frequency , it should have the peak exactly at magnetic transition temperature @xcite .",
    "magnetization or magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature .",
    "the open and closed markers represent zfc and fc data , respectively .",
    "the red , blue , black and gray markers represent @xmath22 obtained by run 1 and run 2 , and @xmath13 for 0.01 t and 1 t , respectively . ]",
    "the spontaneous magnetization is close to null at around @xmath10 , which , naively thinking , implies that there are two kinds of magnetic moments canceling out each other around @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , the internal field at the v site estimated by @xmath30fe mssbauer spectroscopy seems to disappear at around 115 k @xcite , which is in fair agreement with @xmath10 considering the difference between bulk magnetization and the internal field at v site , and possible sample dependence .",
    "of course , it can be assumed that two kinds of magnetic moments develop independently from @xmath5 and @xmath8 . in this case , the magnetic moments ordering at @xmath8 are fixed in opposition to the magnetic field due to those ordering at @xmath5 because the former is smaller in the magnitude just below @xmath8 than the latter .",
    "the former becomes larger in the magnitude below @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is also possible to expect that two kinds of magnetic moments order simultaneously at @xmath5 ; the smaller magnetic moments may develop quickly but the larger ones slowly .",
    "this scenario seems to be more probable considering the unusual development of @xmath25 just below @xmath5 . in either case",
    ", magnetic moments can flip over at around @xmath10 when a large magnetic field is applied , and so no significant difference was observed at @xmath10 in the magnetization between fc and zfc data under the field .",
    "this can give the reason why there is no large difference between fc and zfc magnetization under 7 t ( see fig .",
    "the possible origins of the two kinds of magnetic moments would be the spins and the orbitals of v ions @xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of magnetization under 7 t ( red and blue squares ) and 1 t ( black circles ) .",
    "the open and full markers represent zfc and fc data , respectively . ]",
    "the anomaly at @xmath11 corresponds to the glassy behavior of the thermal conductivity above around @xmath11 @xcite , which suggests that a part of the orbital degree of freedom survives down to @xmath11 and orders at @xmath11 to cause the drop of the magnetization .",
    "the magnitude of the drop at @xmath11 almost coincides with that at @xmath8 , supporting the similarity between the origins of the drops .",
    "khaliullin @xmath31 @xmath32 suggested a partial orbital ordering and g - type spin order below the partial - orbital - ordering temperature @xcite .",
    "since c - type spin order has been confirmed by neutron diffraction measurement at 4.2 k @xcite , the type of the spin order may change at @xmath11 although another neutron diffraction study focused on no change in the spin structure at around @xmath8 @xcite . because the orbital state of lavo@xmath12 could depend on thermal and field history of the sample , careful experiments would be needed to clarify the magnetism of the compound .",
    "five characteristic temperatures of @xmath5 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 were found in the temperature dependence of the magnetization curve .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization appears below @xmath5 and increases with decreasing temperature down to @xmath8 .",
    "below @xmath8 it decreases steeply down to approximately zero at around @xmath10 , at which it starts to increase again .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization shows a small drop at @xmath11 , above which the thermal conductivity shows a glassy behavior .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility shows the peak at @xmath9 , which is also seen in temperature dependence of magnetization under zfc condition , although it was estimated by the magnetization curve measured under fc condition .",
