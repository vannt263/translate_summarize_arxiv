    "experiments with heavy ions performed during the last decade have shown that the internal degrees of freedom of the interacting nuclei play an important role in determining the reaction flux diverted toward the fusion reaction  @xcite .",
    "barrier distribution measurements  @xcite have shown that the coupling of collective degrees of freedom to the fusion channel may enhance the sub - barrier total fusion cross section .",
    "interest in fusion studies at near- and sub - barrier energies with exotic nuclei as projectiles  @xcite has been renewed with the recent increased availability of radioactive ion beams ( rib ) .",
    "the investigation of such reactions involving either unstable nuclei , far from the valley of stability , or weakly bound stable nuclei , such as @xmath0li , should have a great impact on the study of astrophysical processes at very low bombarding energies near the gamow peak  @xcite .",
    "light weakly bound stable and unstable nuclei display low nucleon ( cluster ) separation energies , and are therefore candidates for important breakup ( bu ) cross sections .",
    "this possibility affects the dynamics of fusion reactions  @xcite due to the fact that part of the incoming flux may be lost from the entrance channel before overcoming the fusion barrier and , moreover , one of the fragments removed from the projectile ( or target ) may fuse leading to an important incomplete fusion ( icf ) or transfer ( tr ) contribution . following the review paper of canto _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , we consider here that icf is a two - step process .",
    "after the breakup of the projectile one of the fragments , with approximately the projectile velocity , interacts with the target leading to a compound system formation . on the other hand , tr would be a one - step process in which there is a transfer of a fragment from the projectile to unbound states of the target followed by a particle evaporation .",
    "the final residual nucleus is the same in both cases , being a challenge for the experimental separation of these processes .",
    "the contributions of these reaction mechanisms have not so far been identified in barrier distribution measurements or clearly disentangled in `` singles '' ( inclusive ) particle measurements .",
    "coincidence ( exclusive ) measurements are required to guarantee the occurrence of bu processes in order to shed some light on the understanding of this problem which remains controversial , as conflicting theoretical expectations have been reported in the recent past  @xcite .",

    "this behavior is even stronger for @xmath0he induced reactions  @xcite for which the measured total @xmath2 cross sections are much larger than for @xmath0li due to the strong competition of the 1n- and 2n - transfer reactions as convincingly demonstrated in the @xmath0he  +  @xmath68bi system  @xcite , for instance .",
