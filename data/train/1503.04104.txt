    "<S> we experimentally investigate spin - orbit torques and spin pumping in nife / pt bilayers with direct and interrupted interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the damping - like and field - like torques are simultaneously measured with spin - torque ferromagnetic resonance tuned by a dc bias current , whereas spin pumping is measured electrically through the inverse spin hall effect using a microwave cavity . </S>",
    "<S> insertion of an atomically thin cu dusting layer at the interface reduces the damping - like torque , field - like torque , and spin pumping by nearly the same factor of @xmath01.4 . </S>",
    "<S> this finding confirms that the observed spin - orbit torques predominantly arise from diffusive transport of spin current generated by the spin hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that spin - current scattering at the nife / pt interface contributes to additional enhancement in magnetization damping that is distinct from spin pumping . </S>"
