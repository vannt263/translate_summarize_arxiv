    "recent progress in experimental implementation of quantum algorithms has demonstrated in principle that quantum computers could solve specific problems in fewer steps than any classical machine  @xcite .",
    "these first generation quantum computers were 2-spin molecules in solution .",
    "they were initialized , manipulated and measured at room - temperature using bulk nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy techniques  @xcite .",
    "classical redundancy in the ensemble and the discrete nature of the answers ensured that the correct answers were obtained despite gate imperfections and moderate rates of decoherence .",
    "however , the accumulation of errors would be detrimental in larger quantum computers and for longer computations in the future , and methods to protect quantum information will be needed .",
    "classically , errors ( bit flips ) are detected and fixed by error correcting codes .",
    "information is encoded redundantly , and the output contains information on both the encoded input and the errors that have occurred , so that the errors can be reversed .",
    "generalization to quantum information is non - trivial since it is impossible to clone an arbitrary quantum bit ( qubit ) and to measure quantum states without disturbing the system .",
    "furthermore , there is a continuum of possible errors , and finally , entanglement can cause errors to propagate rapidly throughout the system .    despite the apparent difficulties , quantum error correction was shown to be possible theoretically , and can be useful for reliable computation even when coding operations are imperfect .",
    "shor and steane  @xcite realized a major breakthrough by constructing the first quantum error correcting codes .",
    "prudent use of quantum entanglement enables the information on the errors to be obtained by non - demolition measurements without disturbing the encoded inputs ; it also enables digitization of errors .",
    "these schemes correct for storage errors but not for the extra errors introduced by the coding operations .",
    "the extension to handle gate errors and to achieve reliable computation with a certain accuracy threshold were subsequently developed by many others  @xcite .    in this paper , we report experimental progress toward this elusive goal of continued quantum computation .",
    "we implement a simple phase error detection scheme  @xcite that _ encodes one qubit in two _ and detects a single phase error in either one of the two qubits .",
    "the output state is rejected if an error is detected so that the probability to accept an erroneous state is reduced to the smaller probability of having multiple errors .",
    "our aim is to study the effectiveness of quantum error correction in a real experimental system , focusing on effects arising from imperfections of the logic gates .",
    "therefore , the experiment is designed to eliminate potential artificial origins of bias in the following ways .",
    "first , we compare output states stored with and without coding ( the latter is unprotected but less affected by gate imperfections ) .",
    "second , by ensuring that all qubits used in the code decohere at nearly the same rate , we eliminate apparent improvements brought by having an ancilla with lifetime much longer than the original unencoded qubit .",
    "third , our experiment utilizes only _ naturally occuring _ error processes .",
    "finally , the main error processes and their relative importance to the experiment are thoroughly studied and simulated to substantiate any conclusions . in these aspects ,",
    "our study differs significantly from previous work  @xcite demonstrating quantum error correction working only in principle .    using nuclear spins as qubits , we performed two sets of experiments : ( 1 )",
    "the `` coding experiments '' in which input states were encoded , stored and decoded , and ( 2 ) the `` control experiments '' in which encoding and decoding were omitted . comparing the output states obtained from the coding and the control experiments , both error correction by coding and extra errors caused by the imperfect coding operations",
    "were taken into account when evaluating the actual advantage of coding . in our experiments ,",
    "coding reduced the net error probabilities to second order as predicted , but at the cost of small additional errors which decreased with the original error probabilities .",
    "we identified the major imperfection in the logic gates to be the inhomogeneity in the radio frequency ( rf ) field used for single spin rotations .",
    "simulation results including both phase damping and rf field inhomogeneity confirmed that the additional errors were mostly caused by rf field inhomogeneity .",
    "the causes and effects of other deviations from theory were also studied . _ tomography experiments _ giving the full density matrices at major stages of the experiments further confirmed the agreement between theoretical expectations and the actual results .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured into five sections : section  [ sec : theory ] consists of a comprehensive review of the background material for the subsequent sections of the paper .",
    "this background material includes the phase damping model , the two bit coding scheme , and the theory of bulk nmr quantum computation .",
    "these are reviewed in sections  [ sec : pd ] , [ sec:2bitcode ] and [ sec : nmr ] .",
    "readers who are familiar with these subjects can skip the appropriate parts of the review .",
    "section  [ sec:2bitnmr ] describes the methods to implement the two bit coding scheme in nmr , and the fidelity measures to evaluate the scheme .",
    "section  [ sec : experiment ] presents the experimental details .",
    "section  [ sec : result ] consists of the experimental results together with a thorough analysis .",
    "the effects of coding , gate imperfections and the causes and effects of other discrepancies are studied in detail . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude with a summary of our results . we also discuss syndrome measurement in bulk nmr , the equivalence between logical labeling and coding , the applicability of the two bit detection code as a correction code exploiting classical redundancy in the bulk sample and the signal strength issue in error correction in bulk nmr .",
    "sections  [ sec:2bitnmr ] and [ sec : result ] contain the main results of the paper ; the remainder is included for the sake of completeness and to develop notation and terminology we believe will be helpful to the general reader .",
    "phase damping is a decoherence process that results in the loss of coherence between different basis states .",
    "it can be caused by random phase shifts of the system due to its interaction with the environment .",
    "for example , let @xmath0 be an arbitrary pure initial state .",
    "a phase shift , @xmath1 , can be represented as a rotation about the @xmath2 axis by some angle @xmath3 , @xmath4   %      = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } %      { e^{-i \\theta /2}}&{0}\\\\{0}&{e^{i",
    "\\theta /2 } }   %       \\end{array } \\right ]   % \\label{eq : phasekick } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a pauli matrix .",
    "the resulting state is given by @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the density matrix of the initial qubit , @xmath8   % \\label{eq : denmat } \\,.\\ ] ] after the phase shift given by eq.([eq : phasekick ] ) , the density matrix becomes @xmath9   % \\,.\\ ] ]    here , we model phase randomization as a stochastic markov process with @xmath3 drawn from a normal distribution .",
    "the density matrix resulting from averaging over @xmath3 is @xmath10 ,   % \\label{eq : phasedamp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the variance of the distribution of @xmath3 . by markovity ,",
    "the total phase shift during a time period @xmath12 is a random walk process with variance proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we replace @xmath13 by @xmath14 in eq.([eq : phasedamp ] ) when the time elapsed is @xmath12 .",
    "since the diagonal and the off - diagonal elements represent the populations of the basis states and the quantum coherence between them , the exponential decay of the off - diagonal elements caused by phase damping signifies the loss of coherence without net change of quanta .",
    "one can represent an arbitrary density matrix for one qubit as a bloch vector @xmath16 , defined to be the real coefficients in the _ pauli matrix decomposition _",
    "@xmath17 where the pauli matrices are given by @xmath18,~    %      \\sigma_y = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }       { 0}&{-i}\\\\{i}&{0 } \\end{array } \\right],~    %      \\sigma_z = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }       { 1}&{0}\\\\{0}&{-1 } \\end{array } \\right ]    \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : pauli}\\ ] ] the space of all possible bloch vectors is the unit sphere known as the bloch sphere .",
    "phase damping describes the axisymmetric exponential decay of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 components of any bloch vector , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedamping ] .",
    "in contrast to the above picture of phase damping as a continuous process , we now describe an alternative model of phase damping as a discrete process .",
    "this will facilitate understanding of quantum error correction .",
    "the essence is that any quantum process @xmath21 can be written in the _ operator sum representation _ as  @xcite @xmath22 where the sum is over a _",
    "finite _ number of _ discrete _ events , @xmath23 , which are analogous to quantum jumps , and @xmath24 is positive . for instance , eq.([eq : phasedampmix ] ) describing phase damping can be rewritten as @xmath25 where @xmath26 . in eq.([eq : opsumrep ] ) , the output @xmath27 can be considered as a ( 1-@xmath28):@xmath28 mixture of @xmath7 and @xmath29 ; in other words , @xmath27 is a mixture of the states after the event `` no jump '' ( @xmath30 ) or `` a phase error '' ( @xmath5 ) has occurred .",
    "the weights @xmath31 and @xmath28 are the probabilities of the two possible events . in general ,",
    "each term @xmath32 in eq.([eq : osr ] ) represents the resulting state after the event @xmath23 has occurred , with probability @xmath33 .",
    "this important interpretation is used throughout the paper . note that the decomposition of @xmath27 is a mathematical interpretation rather than a physical process .",
    "the component states @xmath32 of @xmath27 are not generally obtainable because they are not necessarily orthogonal to each other .",
    "we emphasize that eqs.([eq : phasedampmix ] ) and ( [ eq : opsumrep ] ) describe the same physical process .",
    "eq.([eq : opsumrep ] ) provides a discrete interpretation of phase damping , with the continuously changing parameter @xmath34 embedded in the probabilities of the possible events .    for a system of multiple qubits , we _ assume _ independent decoherence on each qubit .",
    "for example , for two qubits @xmath35 and @xmath36 with error probabilities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the joint process is given by @xmath39 where @xmath7 now denotes the @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath40 density matrix for the two qubits .",
    "the events @xmath42 and @xmath43 are first order errors , while @xmath44 is second order .",
    "first and second order events occur with probabilities linear and quadratic in the small error probabilities .",
    "having described the noise process , we now proceed to describe a coding scheme that will correct for it .",
    "quantum error correction is similar to its classical analogue in many aspects .",
    "first , the input is encoded in a larger system which goes through the decoherence process , such as transmission through a noisy channel or storage in a noisy environment .",
    "the encoded states ( codewords ) are chosen such that information on the undesired changes ( error syndromes ) can be obtained in the extra degrees of freedom in the system upon decoding .",
    "then corrections can be made accordingly .",
    "however , in contrast to the classical case , quantum errors occur in many different forms such as phase flips  and not just as bit flips .",
    "furthermore , the quantum information must be preserved without ever measuring it , because measurement which obtains information about a quantum state inevitably disturbs it .",
    "there are excellent references on the theory of quantum error correction  @xcite .",
    "we limit the present discussion to detection codes only .",
    "for a code to detect errors , it suffices to choose the codeword space @xmath45 such that all errors to be detected map @xmath46 to its orthogonal complement . in this way",
    ", detection can be done unambiguously by a projection onto @xmath46 _ without _ distinguishing individual codewords ; hence without disturbing the encoded information . to make this concrete ,",

    "therefore , it is possible to distinguish ( [ eq : iipsi ] ) from ( [ eq : zipsi ] ) and ( [ eq : izpsi ] ) by a projective measurement during decoding , which is described next .    the encoding and decoding can be performed as follows .",
    "we start with an arbitrary input state and a ground state ancilla , represented as qubits @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the circuit in fig .",

    "[ fig : codingcircuit ] ) @xmath57 where eq.([eq : psi33 ] ) is the desired encoded state .",
    "the decoding operation is the inverse of the encoding operation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : codingcircuit ] ) so as to recover the input @xmath58    note that the ancilla becomes @xmath59 upon decoding if and only if a _",

    "moreover , qubits a and b are in product states but they are classically correlated . therefore , syndrome can be read out by a projective measurement on @xmath36 without measuring the encoded state .",
    "the decoding operation transforms the codeword space and its orthogonal complement to the subspaces spanned by @xmath60 and @xmath61 in qubit @xmath36 , while all the encoded information , either with or without error , goes to qubit @xmath35 .",

    "we quantify the error correcting effect of coding using the discrete interpretation of the noise process , leaving a full discussion of the fidelity to section  [ sec:2bitnmr ] .",
    "recall from eq.([eq : opsumrep2 ] ) that the errors @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath42 , and @xmath44 occur with probabilities @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively , and only in the first and the last cases will the output state be accepted .",
    "the probability of accepting the output state is @xmath74 whereas the probability of accepting the correct state is @xmath70 .",
    "the conditional probability of a correct , accepted state is therefore @xmath75 for small @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the code improves the conditional error probability to second order , as a result of screening out the first order erroneous states .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of some properties of the two bit code .",
    "first , the code also applies to mixed input states since the code preserves all constituent pure states in the mixed input .",
    "second , we show here that two qubits are the minimum required to encode one qubit and to detect any phase errors .",
    "let @xmath46 be the 2-dimensional codeword space and @xmath76 be a non - trivial error to be detected .",
    "for phase damping , @xmath76 is unitary and therefore @xmath77 is also 2-dimensional .",
    "moreover , @xmath46 and @xmath77 must be orthogonal if @xmath76 is to be detected .",
    "therefore the minimum dimension of the system is @xmath40 , which requires two qubits .",
    "however , using only two qubits implies other intrinsic limitations .",
    "first , the code can detect but can not distinguish errors .",
    "therefore , it can not correct errors .",
    "moreover , @xmath52 decodes to a correct state in spin @xmath35 which is rejected .",
    "these affect the absolute fidelity ( the overall probability of successful recovery ) but not the conditional fidelity ( the probability of successful recovery if the state is accepted ) .",
    "second , the error @xmath44 can not be detected .",
    "this affects both fidelities but only in second order . to understand why these limitations are intrinsic ,",
    "let @xmath78 be the set of non - trivial errors to be detected .",
    "since @xmath79 has to be orthogonal to @xmath45 for all @xmath80 , and since @xmath46 has a unique orthogonal complement of dimension 2 in a two bit code , it follows that all @xmath79 are equal , and it is impossible to distinguish ( and correct ) the different errors . by the same token , for any distinct errors @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 because they are both orthogonal to @xmath84 , which has a unique 2-dimensional orthogonal complement .",
    "therefore , a two bit code that detects single phase errors can never detect double errors .",
    "finally , since a detection code can not correct errors , it can only improve the conditional fidelity of the _ accepted _ states but not the absolute fidelity . here",
    ", we only remark that the conditional fidelity is a better measure in our experiments due to the bulk system used to implement the two bit code .",
    "a discussion of fidelity measures in our experiments and quantum error correction in bulk systems will be postponed until sections  [ sec:2bitnmr ] and [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the system in which the two bit code is implemented will be described next .",
    "nuclear spin systems are good candidates for quantum computers for many reasons .",
    "nuclear spins can have long coherence times .",
    "coupled operations involving multiple qubits are built in as coupling of spins within molecules .",
    "complex sequences of operations can be programmed and carried out easily using modern spectrometers .",
    "however , the signal from a single spin is so weak that detection is not feasible with current technology unless a bulk sample of identical spin systems is measured .",
    "these identical systems run the same quantum computation in classical parallelism .",
    "computation can be performed at room temperature starting with mixed initial states by distilling the signal of the small excess population in the desired ground state .",

    "we take advantage of the fact that the simulation results are close to the data points but are not as scattered to have a better estimate of this `` cost of the noisy gates '' .",
    "the simulation data can be fitted by @xmath328 .",
    "compared to the ideal case , the coding operations increase the ellipticity by @xmath287 0.06 at @xmath329 , and this extra distortion remains almost constant for all @xmath206 .",
    "the error probabilities as inferred from the ellipticities @xmath330 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : case1 ]  b as a function of storage time .",
    "error correction is also manifested by expressing @xmath331 in the coding experiment as a function of the original @xmath331 in the control experiment , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eorder ] . the quadratic fit to the experimental results gives @xmath332 where @xmath28 stands for @xmath331 in the control experiment , @xmath333 , @xmath334 and @xmath335 .",
    "therefore , the expected improvement @xmath336 is confirmed .",
    "experimentally , the error probabilities are larger than in the ideal case by at most 4.7% and these extra errors decrease with @xmath28 .",
    "the quadratic fit to the simulation results ( which is a good approximation of the experimental data ) gives @xmath337 and differs from the ideal case by a constant amount of @xmath338 for all @xmath28 , which represents the cost of the noisy gates . in conclusion , coding with noisy gates is still effective in our experiments , even though the noisy gates add a constant amount of distortion .",
    "while the data exhibit a clear correction effect , there are notable deviations from the ideal case .",
    "first , the ellipses with coding are smaller than their counterparts without coding .",
    "this is most obvious when the storage time is zero , in which case the coding and the control experiments should produce equal outputs .",
    "second , the signal strength is attenuated with increasing @xmath3 relative to ideal ellipses .",
    "third , although the data points are well fitted by ellipses , their angular positions are not exactly as expected ( `` @xmath3-offsets '' ) .",
    "finally , the spacings between the ellipses deviate from expectation .",
    "the causes of these discrepancies and their implications on error correction are discussed next .",
    "+ * gate imperfections : rf field inhomogeneity *   the major cause of experimental errors is rf field inhomogeneity , which causes gate imperfections .",
    "this was determined by a series of experiments ( details of which are not given here ) , and a thorough numerical simulation , as described below .",
    "the physical origin of the problem is as follows .",
    "the coil windings produce inhomogeneous rf fields that randomize the angles of rotation among molecules . for a single rotation ,",
    "the signal averaged over the ensemble decreases exponentially with the pulse duration to good approximation .",
    "a measure of the rf field inhomogeneity is the signal strength after a @xmath99 pulse .",
    "they are measured to be @xmath287 0.96 and 0.92 for proton and carbon respectively .",
    "in other words , a single @xmath99 pulse has an error of @xmath287 4 - 8% .",
    "rf field inhomogeneity affects our experiments in many ways .",
    "first , it attenuates the signal in both the coding and the control experiments , but the effects are much more severe in the coding experiments which have eight extra pulses .",
    "for instance , when the storage time is zero , the two experiments should have identical outputs , but the ellipse in the coding experiment is actually 5 - 15  % smaller .",
    "second , for each ellipse , attenuation increases with @xmath3 as the preparation pulse @xmath188 becomes longer .",
    "the effects of the rf field inhomogeneity are complicated , because the errors from different rf pulses are correlated , and the correlation depends on the temporal separation between the pulses and the diffusion rate of the molecules .",
    "the correlation time of the rf field inhomogeneity is comparable to the experimental time scales .",
    "for this reason , predictions of the effects of rf field inhomogeneity are analytically intractable .",
    "numerical simulations were performed to model the dominant effects of rf field inhomogeneity .",
    "we followed the evolution of the states assuming random rf field strengths drawn from lorentzian distributions ( also known as cauchy distributions ) with means and standard deviations matching pulse calibration and attenuation for the @xmath99 pulses .",
    "all parameters in the simulation , including @xmath285 s , were determined experimentally without introducing any free parameters .",
    "as the exact time correlation function for the errors was unknown , except for numerical evidence of a long correlation time , we _ assumed _ perfect correlation in the errors .",
    "the simulated ensemble output signal was obtained by gaussian integration with numerical errors bounded to below 1.5% .",
    "the results were shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simellips ] .    besides phase damping and error correction effects in the data ,",
    "the simulations also reproduce extra signal attenuation in the coding experiments .",
    "the ellipticities obtained from simulations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : case1 ] ) approximate the experimental values very well .",
    "such agreement to experimental results is surprising in the absence of free parameters in the model .",
    "simulation results allow the discrepancy between the observed and the ideal ellipticities to be explained in terms of the rf field inhomogeneity and allow the `` cost of coding '' to be better estimated to be the constant 6  % increase in ellipticity or the @xmath287 3  % increase in error probabilities .",
    "the simulation results also predict increasing attenuation with @xmath3 . from the fitted parameter @xmath339 ( see eq.([eq : intensity_mod ] ) ) , the amplitudes at @xmath340 are @xmath287 4% _ weaker _ than the corresponding values at @xmath341 in the simulations .",
    "experimentally , this attenuation increases from @xmath287 8 to 15% ( as storage time increases from 0 to 308 ms ) in the control experiments , and remains @xmath287 8% in the coding experiments .",
    "therefore , rf field inhomogeneity contributes to the attenuation but only partially .",
    "we conclude that rf field inhomogeneity as we have modeled explains the diminished signal strength in the coding experiments .",
    "the simulation quantifies the `` cost of the noisy gates '' .",
    "rf field inhomogeneity also explains part of the attenuation with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "we can also conclude that other discrepancies not predicted by the simulations are _ not _ caused by rf field inhomogeneity and these discrepancies are described next .",
    "+ * other discrepancies *   the simulation results show that rf field inhomogeneity does _ not _ explain why the attenuation at large @xmath3 increases with storage time without coding , and it does not explain the @xmath3-offsets along the ellipses and the unexpected spacings between them .",
    "the increased attenuation with storage time at large @xmath3 can be caused by amplitude damping .",
    "a precise description @xcite of amplitude damping during storage is out of scope of this paper and we consider only the dominant effect predicted by a simple picture . _ phenomenologically _ , the loss of energy to the lattice is described in the nmr literature by @xmath342 where @xmath343 is the thermal equilibrium magnetization .",
    "as @xmath344 at @xmath276 and @xmath123 , we expect no changes at @xmath276 , but expect @xmath345 at @xmath340 to decrease by @xmath346  % for @xmath347 ms and @xmath348 s for proton .",
    "note that refocusing does not affect spin @xmath35 in the control experiments  @xcite but it swaps @xmath349 and @xmath350 halfway during storage , symmetrizing the amplitude damping effects in the coding experiments .",
    "therefore , we expect increased attenuation with storage time in the control experiments only .",
    "this matches our observations that @xmath351 decreases from 8 to 16  % in the control experiments , and remains 8% in the coding experiments",
    ". moreover , earlier data taken without refocusing ( not presented ) have the same trend of increased attenuation with storage time in both the coding and the control experiments .",
    "these are all in accord with the hypothesis that amplitude damping is causing the observed effect .",
    "the second unexplained discrepancy is that the output states span more than a semi - ellipse in the coding experiment but slightly less than a semi - ellipse in the control experiment .",
    "we are not aware of any quantum processes that can be a cause of it .",
    "it is notable that the output states and the fitted ellipticities can be used to infer the initial values of @xmath3 , and they are roughly proportional to the expected values for each ellipse .",
    "the proportionality constants are 5 - 8 % higher than unity in the coding experiment , and 0 - 1.6% lower in the control experiments .",
    "moreover , similar effects are observed in many other experimental runs .",
    "therefore , this is likely to be a systematic error .",
    "we have no convincing explanation for the anomalous spacings between the ellipses in the experiment .",
    "however , from the fact that all the data points belonging to the same ellipse are well fitted by it , the anomalous spacings are unlikely to be caused by random fluctuations on the time scales of each ellipse - experiment .",
    "the effect of the anomalous spacings is reflected in the scattering of the ellipticities of the data , and the large uncertainties in the quadratic fits .    while it is impossible to eliminate or to fully explain these imperfections , it is possible to show that the deviations can not affect the conclusion that error correction is effective .",
    "+ * effects of the discrepancies *   we now consider the effects of the discrepancies on the ellipticities and the inferred fidelities in the experiments .",
    "first of all , radial attenuation of the signal due to rf field inhomogeneity does not affect the ellipticities nor the inferred fidelities ( taken as conditional fidelities ) .",
    "second , different expressions for the `` ellipticity '' are not equivalent when the output states do not form perfect ellipses .",
    "however , they differ by no more than 7 and 3  % in the control and the coding experiments .",
    "@xmath3-offsets along the ellipses are not reflected in the ellipticities , resulting in overestimated inferred fidelities .",
    "this is bounded by 3% .",
    "the scattering of the ellipticities due to anomalous spacings between the ellipses is averaged out with curve - fits to the data .",
    "the most crucial point is , none of these effects have a dependence on the storage time that can be mistaken as error correction .",
    "therefore , the effects of error correction can still be confirmed in the presence of all these small discrepancies .",
    "the two previous subsections dealing with the ellipticities provide an analysis of the global performance of the code .",
    "a stricter analysis is provided in this section using the overlap fidelities given by eq.([eq : expfid ] ) in section  [ sec:2bitnmr ] .",
    "the minimal overlap reflects all defects and deviations hidden in the ellipticities as well as other distortions such as that caused by amplitude damping .",
    "all measurements are normalized using the amplitudes at @xmath269 as described in section  [ sec:2bitnmr ] . in the control experiments ,",
    "the output states at @xmath269 are least affected by amplitude damping and rf field inhomogeneity .",
    "therefore , the normalization can be done accurately . in the coding experiment",
    ", the signal attenuation at @xmath276 due to rf field inhomogeneity can lead to overestimated fidelities .",
    "we determine the uncertainties due to rf field inhomogeneity by the following method . for each storage time ,",
    "the amplitudes of the accepted and the rejected states at @xmath276 are summed .",
    "the sum is compared with the corresponding amplitude at @xmath276 in the control experiment to estimate the attenuation due to rf field inhomogeneity .",
    "the effects on the overlap fidelities are bounded to below 2% .",
    "the errors in the measured peak integrals are propagated to the fidelities which result in standard deviations no more than 0.7% .",
    "we apply similar procedures to the simulation results .",
    "the net error probabilities , given by @xmath352 for the control and @xmath353 for the coding experiments , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rawfidelity ] .",
    "the large difference in the rates of growth of error probabilities confirms the effectiveness of coding even when a stricter measure of fidelity is used .",
    "we have demonstrated experimentally , in a bulk nmr system , that using a two bit phase damping detection code , the distortion of the accepted output states can be largely removed .",
    "these experimental results also provided quantitative measures of the major imperfections in the system .",
    "the principle source of errors , rf field inhomogeneity , was studied and a numerical simulation was developed to model our data . despite the imperfections , a net amount of error correction was observed , when comparing cases with and without coding , and including gate errors in both cases .",
    "our analysis also addresses several theoretical questions in quantum error correction in bulk samples such as the fidelity measures of deviation density matrices . in the following ,",
    "we conclude with some observations regarding quantum error correction in bulk systems , including syndrome measurements , the equivalence between error correction and logical labelling  @xcite , the applicability and advantages of detection codes and some issues in signal strength .",
    "projective syndrome measurements traditionally employed in the standard theory of quantum error correction are impossible in ensemble quantum computation .",
    "measurements via the acquisition of the fid do not reduce individual quantum states and provide only `` average syndromes '' .",
    "moreover , the quantum states are destroyed after acquisition . however , the important point is that syndrome measurement is _ not necessary _ in error correction  @xcite .    in each molecule ,",
    "the syndrome bits carry the error syndrome for that particular molecule after decoding .",
    "these bits can either be used in a controlled - operation to correct the error  @xcite , or in the case of a detection code , to `` logically label '' the correct and erroneous states .",
    "conversely , logical labelling to obtain effective pure states can be considered as error detection : unsuitable initial states are `` detected '' and are labelled as `` bad '' to start with .",
    "both processes involve ejecting the entropy of the system to the ancilla bits .",
    "error detection and logical labelling are therefore similar concepts .",
    "the distinction between correction and detection codes is blurred when using bulk systems .",
    "the objective of error correction is to achieve reliable data transmission or information processing with high probability of success .",
    "when information is encoded in single systems , encoding with an error detection scheme will fail to provide reliable output for two different reasons : accepting an erroneous state or losing the state upon the detection of an error .",
    "therefore , coding schemes capable of _ distinguishing and correcting _ errors are necessary to improve the probability of successful data processing .",
    "in contrast , in a bulk sample , a large initial redundancy exists upon preparation , and the combined signal of all the accepted cases forms the output .",
    "therefore , rejection of the erroneous cases results in a reduction of the signal strength in the improved accepted cases without necessarily causing a failure .",
    "detection codes thus provide a tradeoff between probability of error - free computation and signal strength .",
    "as suggested by this analysis , and in concert with our experimental results , it thus makes sense to use detection codes instead of correction codes in bulk quantum computing systems under certain circumstances .",
    "fundamentally , it is valuable to be able to interchange resources depending on their relative costs , this is illustrated by the following simple example .",
    "suppose a total pool of @xmath354 qubits is available for transmission , and one just wants to correct for single phase flip errors of probability @xmath28 . using a three bit code , one would obtain an aggregate signal strength of @xmath355 , with fidelity @xmath356 , whereas with a two bit code , the accepted signal strength would be @xmath357 , with fidelity @xmath358 . therefore , when @xmath359 , the two - qubit code performs better in this model due to its higher rate .",
    "another example relevant to bulk computation arises when the encoding and decoding circuits fail with probability proportional to the number of elementary gates used .",
    "although errors in consecutive gates can be made to cancel sometimes , this basic scenario is substantiated by our experiment , in which imperfect pulses contribute significantly to the net error .",
    "assume now that we have @xmath360 molecules , which are either two or three qubit systems .",
    "let us compare the performance of the two and three bit codes , based on the strength of the correct output signal . because the correction code requires at least three times as many operations as the detection code  @xcite , the figures of merit obtained for the two schemes are @xmath361 and @xmath362 respectively , where @xmath363 is the gate failure probability . in this model , the detection code performs better for @xmath364 due to the simplicity of the coding operations .",
    "a third example is the case of current state nmr quantum computation at room temperature , in which the intrinsic signal strength decreases exponentially with the number of qubits@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the initial signal strength of an effective pure state of @xmath354 qubits is approximately of order @xmath365 , and thus , for an ensemble of @xmath360 molecules , the signal strengths of the outputs from the correction and detection codes are about @xmath366 and @xmath367 respectively .",
    "according to this measure of performance , the detection code outperforms the correction code for @xmath368 ( @xmath369 in our experiments ) .",
    "if signal strength indeed decreases exponentially with @xmath354 , then some interesting generalizations can be made .",
    "for arbitrary qubit errors , a @xmath12-error detection code has distance @xmath370 , while a @xmath12-error correction code has distance @xmath371  @xcite .",
    "if one encodes @xmath80 bits in @xmath372 , the extra number of qubits used , @xmath373 , satisfies the singleton bound  @xcite , @xmath374 .",
    "therefore , the output signal strengths for detection and correction codes would be approximately proportional to @xmath375 and @xmath376 , where @xmath377 is a polynomial .",
    "the detection code is thus always better asymptotically in this model@xcite .",
    "this work illustrates how a careful study of dynamics in bulk quantum systems can provide a valuable opportunity to demonstrate and test theories of quantum information and computation .",
    "the development of temporal , spatial , logical , and related labeling techniques opens a window allowing information about the dynamics of single quantum systems to be extracted from bulk systems .",
    "furthermore , by systematically developing an experimental toolbox of quantum circuits and quantum error correction and detection codes , experiments which test multiple particle quantum behavior become increasingly accessible . with improvements in the initial polarization in the systems and new labeling algorithms which do not incur exponential signal loss  @xcite , and with better methods to control the major source of error , the rf field inhomogeneity",
    ", we believe that further study of bulk quantum systems will complement the study of single quantum systems , provide new insights into the dynamical behavior of open quantum systems , and further the potential for quantum information processing .",
