    "the concept of stationarity is crucial in the statistical theory of time series analysis , especially for the development of asymptotic theory .",
    "however , the assumption of stationarity is often not realistic in applications .",
    "for example , a time series can display significant changes through time and therefore stationarity is a questionable assumption .",
    "one of the most important consequences , is that attempts to develop asymptotic results are , generally speaking , groundless , since future information of the process does not necessarily contain any information regarding the present of the process .",
    "in addition , there is no natural generalization of stationarity to non - stationarity , since non - stationary processes might exhibit trend or / and periodicity and other types of non - standard behaviour .",
    "@xcite considered non - stationary processes whose characteristics are changing slowly over time and developed the theory of evolutionary spectra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , such an approach makes it difficult to obtain asymptotic results , which are needed for developing estimation theory .",
    "in order to apply standard asymptotic theory for non - stationary processes , dahlhaus , in a series of contributions , introduced an appropriate theoretical framework , based on the concept of local stationarity ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the definition of local stationarity is based on the existence of a time varying spectral representation ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite gives an excellent and detailed overview of the theory of locally stationary processes .",
    "a comparison between the methodology developed by dahlhaus and priestley is discussed in @xcite .",
    "some other works related to locally stationary time series include the works by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "the main goal of this contribution is to utilize the idea of local stationarity , in the sense of the above mentioned papers , for studying the spectral behaviour of time series , based on the system of walsh functions .",
    "these functions led to the development of walsh - fourier ( square wave ) analysis , just like the sinusoidal functions led to fourier ( trigonometric ) analysis .",
    "the motivation behind walsh - fourier analysis was the need to approximate stationary time series , which display square waveforms with abrupt switches ( e.g. in communications and engineering ) , see @xcite for instance .",
    "we introduce the concept of local stationarity but based on the orthogonal system of walsh functions to account for such phenomena that exhibit , in addition , non - stationary behaviour .",
    "we study important general classes of time series , similar in concept with the time varying arma ( tvarma ) process- see @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that our theory and methods will be applicable to non - stationary data observed in diverse applications like pattern recognition for binary images , linear system theory and other ( see @xcite , for more ) .",
    "the walsh functions were introduced by @xcite .",
    "they take only two values , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and have similar properties with the trigonometric functions ( although they are not periodic ) .",
    "the introduction of walsh functions has been followed by a series of papers , related to their mathematical properties and generalizations ( @xcite ) , which provided the theoretical framework for various applications , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "@xcite gives an excellent account of the history of walsh functions and a comparison between walsh and fourier analysis .",
    "the statistical analysis of stationary time series via walsh functions has been based on real and dyadic time .",
    "the dyadic time is based on the concept of dyadic addition ( see subsection [ s : preli : ss : dad ] ) . for time points @xmath2 , the real time sum @xmath3 is now replaced by the dyadic sum @xmath4 @xcite reviewed work on walsh spectral analysis in both time scales .",
    "walsh - fourier analysis of real time stationary processes has been studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "the dyadic time stationarity is defined in respect to the real time stationarity as in subsection [ s : preli : ss : ds ] ( see also @xcite ) .",

    ", @xcite studied the finite walsh transform , considered the walsh periodogram as an estimator of the walsh spectrum and studied its theoretical properties .",
    "@xcite proved that a dyadic stationary process has always unique spectral representation in terms of the system of walsh functions and studied the dyadic linear process ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also studied dyadic autoregressive and moving average processes and their relation .    in this article",
    ", we introduce the concept of local dyadic stationarity and discuss the advantages and the perspectives of such consideration in the framework of walsh functions . in section @xmath5 of this article , we recall some definitions and review some fundamental results for dyadic stationary processes . in section @xmath6 , we introduce the concept of local dyadic stationarity and study the time varying dyadic moving average process . in section @xmath7",
    ", we define the general class of time varying dyadic autoregressive moving average processes and show that they exhibit locally dyadic stationarity .",
    "the article concludes with several remarks concerning further research in this topic .",
    "we recall the definition of dyadic addition and of a dyadic process following @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath8 and @xmath9 to be non - negative integers that have the following dyadic expansions @xmath10 then , the dyadic sum @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 consider now @xmath13 and @xmath14 to be real numbers that belong to the interval @xmath15 we write @xmath16 in general , each of the above representations is not unique .",

    "if @xmath33 is a square integrable function , then it can be expanded in a walsh - fourier series , i.e. @xmath34 with @xmath35 + ( ii ) @xmath36 and @xmath37    the above properties of walsh functions motivate the study of stationary time series in terms of this basis . it is well known that a second order stationary process @xmath38 is represented as    @xmath39    with @xmath40 an orthogonal - increment process such that    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the dirac function periodically extended to @xmath43 with period @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the spectral distribution function ( see @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "the walsh functions can be used instead to represent @xmath46 under the concept of dyadic stationarity .",
    "there are differences though between real and dyadic stationary processes ; see @xcite for further discussion .",
