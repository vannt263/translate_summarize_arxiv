    "in recent years , super - kamiokande , sno and kamland have shown that the three known types of neutrino ( @xmath6 ) have mass and undergo flavor oscillation .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 or @xmath8 oscillations were proven by sno @xcite , kamland @xcite measured the oscillation parameters @xmath9ev@xmath10 and @xmath11 , and super - kamiokande measured the oscillation parameters ( @xmath12ev@xmath10 and @xmath13 @xcite ) .",
    "other interesting issues remain .",
    "strangely , both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are close to maximal but @xmath0 is constrained to be small by chooz .",
    "additionally , neutrinos may violate cp conservation . in experiments that search for @xmath16 appearance in a @xmath17 beam the cp violating term and @xmath0 are degenerate .",
    "disappearance experiments that measure the @xmath1 remaining in a @xmath1 source are sensitive only to @xmath0 , allowing a clean measurement . in the following , `` chooz ''",
    "will refer to the original experiment @xcite , `` double chooz '' to the new proposal .",
    "the most important improvement to chooz will be a near detector situated @xmath18 meters from the reactor cores",
    ". its inner detector will be identical to that of the far detector enabling a precise measurement of the unoscillated @xmath1 signal .",
    "its outer detector will incorporate an extra veto covering the top and sides to account for the higher muon flux at its shallow depth ( @xmath19 meters water equivalent ) .",
    "chooz has the best upper limit on @xmath0 of at .",
    "the @xmath1s were detected via the inverse beta decay reaction @xmath20 , giving a prompt signal due to the @xmath21 and a delayed signal @xmath22 later from neutron capture on gadolinium ( gd ) .",
    "gd doped scintillator has a short capture time and increased neutron capture detection efficiency due to the large amount of energy released ( @xmath23 mev ) .",
    "unfortunately , nitrates used to dissolve the gd caused a reaction with the scintillator that colored it , limiting the lifetime of the experiment . since the chooz result , r&d work for lens at the max plank institute has developed two classes of gd loaded scintillator suitable for a new generation of reactor neutrino experiment .",
    "the signal to noise ratio of double chooz will be @xmath24 , four times better than chooz .",
    "this results from doubling the target volume and providing a non - scintillating buffer zone between the target and the pmts to reduce background .",
    "table  [ table:1 ] shows the systematic uncertainties expected . the differences between the near and far detectors must be small in order to achieve our goal of 0.6% total relative systematic uncertainty",
    "particular care must be taken to ensure that both detectors have the same number of target protons .",
    "therefore both target vessels will be made to the same specifications by the same vendor at the same time .",
    "they will then be installed , fully assembled , into their respective detectors and filled from the same batch of scintillator .",
    "the scintillator will be carefully weighed during the filling process .    the improved detector design and lower background rate will enable a simplification of the analysis relative to chooz .",
    "the double chooz analysis will require only energy and time cuts .",
    ".summary of systematic uncertainties at [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     a singles event rate at the level of 1hz will be achieved with u , th and k concentrations of @xmath25 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 grams / gram respectively in the scintillator and @xmath26 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 grams / gram respectively in the acrylic vessels .",
    "background estimates from the rock were scaled from the chooz experiment while those of the pmts were obtained from simulations which included hamamatsu estimates .",
    "the correlated backgrounds can also be estimated by scaling from the chooz experiment using reactor off data . the @xmath28 and @xmath29 rate measured in chooz was .",
    "doubling the target volume gives in double chooz .",
    "the sensitivity limit of double chooz is shown in figure  [ figure:1 ] , assuming an achievable systematic uncertainty of  0.6% and a @xmath1 signal rate of @xmath30 events over three years .",
    "the old chooz limit is surpassed within a few months , even before the near detector is built .",
    "the sensitivity after three years with the near detector will be @xmath31 , giving an @xmath32 reduction in the chooz limit and excellent discovery potential ..    9 sno collaboration , phys.rev.lett . 92 ( 2004 ) 181301 kamland collaboration , phys.rev.lett . 94 ( 2005 ) 081801 super - kamiokande collaboration , phys.rev .",
