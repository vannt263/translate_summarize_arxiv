    "recent spectroscopic xmm - newton and chandra x - ray observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have detected a new absorption feature around @xmath10@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "this has been identified as an unresolved transition array ( uta ) due mainly to @xmath12 inner shell absorption in moderately charged iron ions with an open m - shell (  ) . on the basis of atomic structure calculations and photoabsorption modeling , @xcite pointed out that the shape of the uta features can be used for diagnostics of the agn absorber .",
    "however , @xcite noted a disagreement between the predicted and observed shape of this feature . as a possible cause for this discrepancy they suggested an underestimation of the low temperature dielectronic recombination ( dr ) rate coefficients for iron m - shell ions .",
    "these rate coefficients determine the charge state balance of the iron m - shell ions in a photoionized plasma and , consequently , the shape of the uta .",
    "reliable low temperature dr rate coefficients of iron m - shell ions are not available in the literature .",
    "the widely used compilation of @xcite is largely based on theoretical work by @xcite and @xcite . the purpose of this early theoretical work was to produce dr data for modeling coronal equilibrium .",
    "however ions form in coronal equilibrium at temperatures about an order of magnitude higher than those where they form in photoionized gas @xcite . therefore",
    ", it is questionable to use these theoretical dr data for photoabsorption modeling .",
    "benchmarking by experiment is highly desirable .",
    "the only dr measurements for m - shell ions of third- and fourth - row elements available up to now are those for na - like @xcite ; ar - like and @xcite ; and mg - like @xcite .",
    "although being of minor astrophysical relevance , the and measurements illustrate that the low - energy recombination spectra of m - shell ions can be dominated by strong resonances associated with @xmath4 core excitations .",
    "this work presents the experimental measurement of radiative recombination ( rr )  +  dr for forming . in the temperature range where is expected to exist in a photoionized plasma , our experimentally - derived rr  +  dr rate coefficient is orders of magnitude larger than the sum of the recommended rr value from @xcite and the dr value from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "as dr is much larger than rr at these temperatures , this discrepancy is clearly due to errors in the recommended dr data .",
    "a similar discrepancy can be expected for the other iron m - shell ions .",
    "this has important consequences for the modeling of agn spectra .",
    "the experiment was performed at the heavy - ion test storage ring tsr of the max - planck - institut fr kernphysik in heidelberg , germany ( ) .",
    "measurements employed the well established procedures for studying electron - ion recombination . details of experimental and data reduction procedures as well as further references are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a beam of @xmath13 was provided by the accelerator facility .",
    "after acceleration to an energy of @xmath14 the ion beam was injected into the storage ring where it was collinearly overlapped with a magnetically guided electron beam . in the overlap region the ions can recombine with the electrons via rr and dr .",
    "recombined ions were separated from the ion beam in the first dipole magnet after the electron - ion interaction region and counted using a single - particle scintillation - counter with a nearly @xmath15 detection efficiency .",
    "the systematic experimental uncertainty of the measured recombination rate coefficient is estimated to be @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty stems mostly from the ion current measurement .",
    "adding further uncertainties discussed in sec .",

    "furthermore the high-@xmath39 limit of the @xmath38 resonances and the series limit of the @xmath40 series at @xmath41 @xcite are quasi degenerate within @xmath42 .",
    "dr resonances associated with a @xmath43 fine structure excitation were found to be important for low - temperature dr of forming @xcite .",
    "the measured mbrrc exhibits a regular rydberg series of @xmath44 resonances . in the present case such a regular resonance pattern from the @xmath45 series is not observed .",
    "the question remains to what extend the unusually strong rise in dr resonance strength below @xmath37 is caused by the near degeneracy of @xmath38 and @xmath40 resonances .",

    "these occur at about @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 according the nist atomic spectra data - base @xcite .",
    "identification of the observed peak features with individual rydberg series is challenging except for the series limits .    the plasma recombination rate coefficient ( prrc )",
    "is derived by convolving the measured mbrrc with a maxwell - boltzmann electron energy distribution . as detailed by @xcite , there are three issues that require special consideration : the experimental energy spread , the recombination rate enhancement at low energies , and field ionization of high rydberg states in the storage - ring bending magnets .     and @xmath65 resonances attached to the @xmath9 and @xmath8 core excitations , respectively . ]    the experimental energy spread @xmath66 influences the outcome of the convolution for resonances with resonance energies @xmath67 .",
    "this can be circumvented by extracting the dr cross section from the measured mbrrc at low energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowe ] this was achieved by fitting @xmath68 dr resonance line - shapes to the measured spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that most probably none of the @xmath68 dr line - shapes correspond to a single resonance but each rather comprises a blend of resonances .",
    "additionally the fit includes a contribution due to rr which was calculated using a semi - empirical hydrogenic formula ( eq .  12 of * ? ? ?",

    "the measured mbrrc exceeds the theoretical expectation by factors of typically @xmath70@xmath71 @xcite .",
    "this excess rate coefficient ( labeled @xmath72 in fig .  [ fig : lowe ] ) is an artifact of the merged - beams technique and hence a mean excess rate coefficient was subtracted prior to the derivation of the prrc .",
    "field ionization of the loosely bound high rydberg electron in the recombined ions can result from the motional electric fields they experience inside the storage ring bending magnets @xcite . in the present experiment only rr and",
    "dr involving capture into rydberg levels with quantum numbers less than @xmath73 contribute to the mbrrc .",
    "similar to the approach of @xcite and @xcite , the missing dr resonance strength up to @xmath74 was estimated from a theoretical calculation using the autostructure code @xcite .",
    "although the autostructure code fails to reproduce the irregular resonance structure below @xmath75 , it reproduces the more regular resonance structures of high - n rydberg resonances close to the various series limits reasonably well when slight ` manual adjustments ' are made to the autoionization transition rates .    the unmeasured dr contribution due to @xmath76",
    "was estimated to contribute ( @xmath77)% to the experimentally - derived prrc for plasma temperatures @xmath78 .",

    "uncertainties in the non - resonant portion of the background that was not due to rr contributed an estimated 8% error to the measurement .",
    "uncertainties in the exact enhancement factor near @xmath88 contributed a 2.1% uncertainty at @xmath89 , and 1.4% at @xmath90 , and less than 1% above @xmath91 . adding these , the transition rate uncertainty , and the 15% systematic uncertainty in quadrature gives a total experimental uncertainty of @xmath92 in the energy range @xmath87 .",
