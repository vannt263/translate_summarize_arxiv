    "[ [ section ] ]    the 1975 edition of classical electrodynamics by jackson^@xcite^ poses the problem of finding the electromagnetic field of a circularly polarized beam of light .",
    "the suggested solution satisfies the vanishing divergence of the electric field but not the wave equation , so that the intensity of the beam should vary only very slowly across its width compared to the wavelength .",
    "the gravitational effects of such a beam ( or something close to it ) are invstigated by bonnor^@xcite^ , who found exact solutions to the einstein equations for beams of _ null dust _ ,",
    "grains of which fall along null geodesics without the considerations of finite wavelength ( c.f . photons ) and which , for the representation of circularly polarized waves may be chosen to spin .",
    "most recently , efforts have been made by lynden - bell and bik to complete the picture by reconciling bonnor s solutions with full classical electromagnetic sources .",
    "since the angular momentum density of jackson s solution is concentrated in the ` skin ' of an otherwise uniform beam , the problem lends itself to a study of gravomagnetic effects : it is well known^@xcite@xcite^ that such gravitational solenoids , both of material and gravitational sources enclose a uniform gravomagnetic field which rotates the inertial frames within .",
    "furthermore^@xcite^ , an infinite observer of such a material cylindrical shell which is simultaneously transmitting a torque along its length is known to additionally find themselves in a apace wrapped helically around the cylinder axis .",
    "an escalation of this problem is the equivalent beam of circularly polarized gravitational waves .",
    "it is the simplest notion of gravitational waves , that emergent from _ linearized gravitation _",
    ", that bears the closest resemblance to its electromagnetic counterpart , so in this regime the problem is fairly well posed : we do _ not _ attempt an exact solution of the einstein equations . in order to relate the ` metric ' produced by the beam to the beam itself , which is of course only a perturbation of the very same metric , we adapt the approach first formulated by isaacson^@xcite^ and later expounded by lifshitz^@xcite^ : a wave - like metric perturbation may ` massage ' the spacetime across which it ripples into a further non - oscillating ` background ' perturbation , and the interesting physics is contained therein .",
    "is devoted to the linearised gravitational analogy of jackson s solution . using the energy momentum pseudotensor of landau and lifshitz",
    "it is shown that the resultant description is consistent with that of a beam of gravitons , each bearing angular momentum @xmath3 and energy @xmath4 ; this is similar to the null dust picture , and the analogous result for photons is also mentioned in @xcite .",
    "is a search for the background metric ( with a short reminder of the established method ) and a discussion of its place in the theory .",
    "latin indices run over four dimensions and greek indices run over spatial dimensions only .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    we consider a beam of linearized gravitational waves propagating down the @xmath5-axis . as is usual ,",
    "we write this as a perturbation @xmath6 with @xmath7 of the underlying minkowski metric , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and enforce the gravitational lorentz gauge condition , @xmath10 from which the linearized einstein equations become wave - like : @xmath11 within the gravitational lorentz gauge the usual coordinate transformations , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , are made to move to the _ transverse traceless _ ( tt ) gauge : @xmath14 . from the fourier expansion ,",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 and since the real and imaginary parts of @xmath18 independently satisfy in the tt gauge , @xmath19 which , writing @xmath20 , gives a general solution of the lorentz gauge constraint presented in .",
    "it remains to satisfy the dalembertian of , which is trivial for the case of plane waves where the @xmath21 are constant .",
    "if however the fourier coefficients vary on a wavelength @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , operators of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are @xmath27 or @xmath2 could be ignored and so therefore could @xmath28 .",
    "then , enforcing tracelessness there is the usual choice of plus and cross - polarized gravity waves : @xmath29 , @xmath30 . for the circularly polarized case",
    "we define some sufficiently slowly varying transverse envelope @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "this yields to @xmath34 ,    .[tab2]the components of @xmath6 up to solution of the lorentz gauge .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     [ [ section-4 ] ]    in order to gain traction it is a great simplification to consider the regime where @xmath35 is small , specifically small enough that we may neglect its christoffel symbols in .",
    "we expect averaged quantities to vary only transversely to the beam and to do so with characteristic frequency @xmath36 , as does @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , we will neglect the latter two terms in , and by doing so we are effectively linearizing the theory of this background field .",
    "if @xmath35 were expanded in powers of @xmath38 , the largest components of , relevant to @xmath39 , ( see ) give @xmath40 whilst @xmath41 so that @xmath42 and so for the linearization of the background to be valid we require @xmath43 .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    in order to study the finer aspects of the background metric , we desire to solve the corrective @xmath44 components from , i.e. to account for the next largest terms in @xmath45 .",
    "preferably this may be done by further perturbing @xmath46 to give some @xmath47 and proceeding as before , however there are two potential complications .",
    "firstly , we must be sure the @xmath44 terms on the lhs of are a product of a linearisable perturbation rather than those terms quadratic in the christoffel symbols of @xmath48 which we previously neglected .",
    "secondly , we must take into account any @xmath44 terms from the rhs of .",
    "the @xmath44 relations are also to be found in .",
    "the neglected terms in are @xmath49 and so we must confine ourselves to the case @xmath50 . turning our attention to the rhs of",
    ", we use the definition in @xcite : @xmath51_{,m , l},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] wishing to expand this expression in terms of the rapidly oscillating quantities of @xmath52 . a well - known formula for the perturbed metric determinant up to second order gives @xmath53 and so any corrections to would be from @xmath54 the perturbation @xmath55 contains important terms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , so attention is confined to terms of the form @xmath58 or @xmath59 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 are @xmath27 or @xmath2 , and @xmath63 and @xmath5 are @xmath64 or @xmath65 . by expanding the only such terms",
    "are found not to survive averaging over a wave cycle ; consequently , to this new order the rhs of may be neglected .",
    "one way to justify neglecting any cross terms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 above would be to demand @xmath68 , or @xmath69 .",
    "the picture is clearer if we choose @xmath6 to be the ` fundamental ' perturbation of the metric of @xmath56 , in which the @xmath35 is effectively second order : by always choosing sufficiently small @xmath37 ( i.e. a weak beam ) considerations of the smallness of @xmath38 should decouple from that of @xmath37 .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    now attention is turned to the axisymmetric beam : @xmath70 .",
    "we begin by discussing the @xmath27 , @xmath2 subspace transverse to the propagation of the wave in the @xmath48 approximation .",
    "it is enough to notice that the interval of a transverse , purely space - like four - vector must be isotropic about the @xmath5-axis to see that @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i.e. the background metric merely dilates the transverse space . then reduces to @xmath73 and since the radially symmetric solutions to the @xmath2-d laplace equation are logarithmic or constant , we apply the obvious boundary conditions on the @xmath5-axis and at infinity , setting @xmath74 . by analogy with @xcite",
    "there is expected to be some mixing of the azimuthal coordinate with both time and the axis of propagation , these corrections look in cylindrical coordinates like @xmath75\\bigg|_{cylindrical}= \\left (   \\begin{array}{cccc } 0 & 0 & \\psi\\rho^2 & 0 \\\\ \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & 0 & \\chi\\rho^2 \\\\ \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & 0 \\\\ \\end{array }   \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or transforming to cartesian coordinates , @xmath76\\bigg|_{cartesian}= \\left (   \\begin{array}{cccc } 0 & -y\\psi & x\\psi & 0 \\\\ \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & 0 & 0 & -y\\chi \\\\ \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & 0 & x\\chi \\\\ \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot & 0 \\\\ \\end{array }   \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] generally , one could posit mixing of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , however the relevant terms disappear identically in the linearized @xmath79 so it is not possible to infer them .",
    "furthermore the wave - like perturbation that was initially enforced , @xmath6 , has certain symmetries which are not expected to be broken by the background metric @xmath35 : particularly we expect the killing vector to be @xmath80 , since the beam is invariant under an inversion of time , the azimuthal coordinate and the central axis . since however radial frame dragging would be reversed by this transformation , it may be neglected .",
    "we begin with @xmath81 , noting that the contents of show that @xmath82 and @xmath83 obey the same ode : @xmath84 at this point we could consider a scale . ]",
    "on which the beam has a uniform interior intensity and @xmath85 from . ]",
    "which sharply vanishes outside its radius , @xmath86 , so that @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is heaviside s step function .",
    "this gives @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are constants . in electromagnetism ,",
    "thin , long solenoids enclose uniform magnetic fields which vanish on the outside ; the same can be demanded of the beam by setting @xmath92 and @xmath93 so that the solution is @xmath94 given that @xmath95 and @xmath96 we have @xmath97 within and zero without .",
    "[ fig2 ]     [ [ section-7 ] ]    by integrating the angular momentum density over the transverse plane and recalling the choice of @xmath98 we see that the density of linear momentum in the ` skin ' of the beam must be @xmath99 and applying the gravomagnetic biot savart law for a presumably uniform axial @xmath100 field gives the same result immediately .",
    "the beam is therefore understood to be a gravomagnetic solenoid . neglecting @xmath101 time - dilation effects as extra small , the mixed space - time corrections in represent a rotation of the inerial frame at angular velocity , @xmath102 .",
    "this may be compared with the formula @xmath103 from @xcite which describes the same effect for a general mass - energy cylinder of angular momentum per unit length , @xmath104 .",
    "these effects are illustrated in .    that this is not a _",
    "effect outside the beam is because the rotational dragging of the frame about the beam cancels exactly with the shearing of the frames , the tidal torques , at every point ; contrast this with kerr spacetime where the principal gravomagnetic effect is not that of frame dragging around the black hole , but of such tidal torques , which act in a counter - rotating sense to the source .",
    "there are no tidal torques within the beam , and the uniform rotation of the inertial frame may therein be cast as a gravomagnetic field .    for @xmath105 ,",
    "taking @xmath106 gives @xmath107 this choice of integration constants is indicated by @xcite , where the metric external to the thin material cylindrical shell carrying a torque as well as linear momentum is shown to be twisted into a helix whose pitch ( or @xmath83 ) vanishes at @xmath86 to match the interior and approaches a constant at infinite radius .",
