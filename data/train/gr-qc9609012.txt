    "among the earliest calculations of astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation is the `` drpp '' calculation @xcite@xcite of radiation emitted when a particle , starting from rest at infinity , falls into a nonspinning black hole . in this work ,",
    "the mass of the particle is treated as a perturbation of the schwarzschild spacetime and the einstein equations , to first order in this perturbation , are organized into the zerilli equation@xcite , a single linear wave equation .",
    "this work was later elaborated by ruffini and ferrari@xcite who considered the head - on plunge of a particle which starts with nonzero inward velocity at spatial infinity .",
    "there is now a renewed interest in such calculations .",
    "the advent of laser interferometric gravity wave detectors@xcite has directed attention at black hole collisions as one of the most plausible , and surely the most fascinating , sources of detectable waves .",
    "but the generation of strong waves is a process without simplifying symmetries and one which involves strong field interactions .",
    "the challenge of finding energies and waveforms generated in these processes helped to spur the recent effort in numerical relativity and , in particular , in the binary black hole supercomputing grand challenge@xcite . because of the difficulty of direct supercomputer solutions , approximate methods , as checks and guides , are very valuable .",
    "the `` particle limit '' in which the mass of one of the holes is very small , is in this category , and models of holes in binary orbits are a fundamental tool .",
    "we are interested here in using a particle model to help in the understanding of numerical relativity results for collisions of holes . to date",
    "those computations have been limited to head on , axisymmetric collisions@xcite .",
    "the codes have also been limited in the time for which they can evolve solutions .",
    "infall from very large distances can not at present be evolved ; computations start from finite separation of the holes , so direct comparison with the drpp results can not be made .",
    "we present here an extension of the drpp calculation to the case of infall from finite radius .",
    "the extension is not at all straightforward .",
    "if the particle starts at infinity , the initial value data can be taken as zero , so that the spacetime is unperturbed schwarzschild until the gravitational influence of the particle is felt .",
    "if the particle starts from finite radius , the specification of compatible initial value data can not be avoided .",
    "understanding the influence of the initial data is , in fact , a major motivation for the present work .",
    "supercomputer evolution will be limited , for the foreseeable future , to evolving the interaction of holes for short times .",
    "the starting point for these evolutions will be initial data from some approximation method ( e.g. , a post - newtonian expansion ) .",
    "the way to make the bridge from the approximation to the strong field realm of supercomputing requires that we understand what the crucial features are of the initial value data .",
    "it seems to us that the particle limit provides a very useful probe of this issue .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we start by presenting the basic mathematical approach . like the drpp calculation ,",
    "our approach uses frequency components .",
    "a laplace transform converts the linearized einstein equation for each @xmath6-pole , from a partial differential equation in schwarzschild coordinates @xmath7 to a set of ordinary differential equations in @xmath8 .",
    "the laplace transform treats the initial data mathematically as if it were a source , and helps with insight into the relation of the initial value data and the stress - energy source .",
    "two points in particular should be noted in sec .",
    "ii . the first concerns the linearized wave equation .",
    "the equation presented by zerilli was formulated in the regge - wheeler gauge@xcite , a specific first order coordinate choice .",
    "the zerilli equation was presented through a fourier transform and has no direct equivalent as a partial differential equation .",
    "this is not a fundamental obstacle , but it does complicate the relationship of the zerilli wave function and the initial data . to avoid these problems we use the moncrief formulation of the problem@xcite .",
    "moncrief s wave function is constructed explicitly from initial data and is equivalent to the zerilli wave function except for source - like terms . the second point to notice",
    "has to do with conventions .",
    "a variety of conventions has been used for normalizing the zerilli ( or moncrief ) functions and their transforms . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a definition of all our conventions and their relationship to those used elsewhere .",
    "aspects of the numerical approach , a green function integral , are discussed in sec .",
    "a major issue is the need for highly accurate evaluation of the green function integrals in order to preclude numerical errors from giving rise to an erroneous initial burst of radiation .",
    "numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "iv for energy , spectra , and waveforms .",
    "plots are given for infall starting from rest at radii ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "these are combined with results for infall from infinity to give a complete picture of the dependence of the radiation on the initial physical conditions .",
    "the numerical results are discussed in sec .",
    "v and are compared with predictions based on other results and approximations , especially those of the close - limit approximation .    throughout the rest of the paper we use @xmath11 units , the signature @xmath12 , and other conventions of the misner , thorne and wheeler textbook@xcite .",
    "for the straight - line plunge of a particle into a nonspinning hole the perturbations of the schwarzschild spacetime are all even - parity .",
    "we take the particle to be moving along the @xmath13 axis , so that the perturbations are not dependent on the azimuthal angle @xmath14 , to describe the perturbations we use the notation of regge and wheeler@xcite , here specialized to the axisymmetric @xmath6-pole case ( @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the unperturbed line element for a schwarzschild spacetime of mass @xmath2 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are functions of @xmath7 , and where @xmath20 are the @xmath15 spherical harmonics .",

    "it is , however , straightforward to use the same steps as zerilli in the regge - wheeler gauge . but confined to the @xmath7 domain .",
    "it turns out that to decouple the even - parity variables in the perturbed einstein equations , one needs to take an extra time derivative .",

    "this waveform has a similar ringing pattern as the infall from finite radius , but lacks the initial waveform depression .",
    "the end of the initial waveform depression is , roughly , the beginning of of quasinormal ringing , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the generation of quasinormal ringing@xcite is associated with the peak of the potential in ( [ zpotential ] ) .",
    "the time @xmath200 at which the particle reaches the peak , at around @xmath201 is at retarded time @xmath202 .",
    "this is consistent with fig.[hir0]a , which shows ringing beginning somewhere around this value of @xmath37 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the waveforms for a particle falling from rest , to the waveform of a particle on a time - symmetric geodesic trajectory , a particle that long in the past was moving radially outward just outside a hole , that reaches a certain maximum radius @xmath1 at time @xmath114 , and that subsequently falls into the hole .",
    "the analysis of this case requires only a simple modification of ( [ sofar ] ) ; the initial value terms are omitted and ( due to time symmetry of the source ) the complex conjugate of @xmath203 is added to @xmath158 .",
    "the resulting waveform is shown in fig .",
    "[ poisson]a , and has also been given in ref .",
    "that waveform shows two periods of quasinormal ringing , an early one excited when the particle goes outward through the region around the potential peak , and a later one due to motion inward through the peak .",
    "this later period of ringing , and in fact all features of the waveform generated after @xmath204 agree very closely with the waveform for the particle falling from rest . because the earlier ringing has a higher amplitude , the energy spectrum for the symmetric trajectory , shown in fig .",
    "[ poisson]b , is dominated by this early ringing , and has very large amplitude . in the figure",
    "it is seen to be much larger than the drpp spectrum , which ( see fig .",
    "[ hir0 ] ) approximates the spectrum for infall from @xmath205 .",
    "since the spectra for infall from both small @xmath1 and from @xmath115 have a single peak ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ specshapes ] ) it is interesting that for intermediate values of @xmath1 the spectra are characterized by a row of more - or - less evenly spaced bumps .",
    "as @xmath1 grows , the number of bumps increases , and the bumps decrease in spacing and in height .",
    "the origin of these modulations can be understood by considering a simple example : suppose a waveform consists of nothing but a single period of quasinormal ringing with the transform @xmath107 .",
    "the transform of the same waveform shifted later in time by @xmath206 would be @xmath207 .",
    "a wave consisting of _ two _ periods of ringing , the original and the later one , would then have a transform @xmath208 , and hence an energy spectrum @xmath209 the combined spectrum would have the shape of the single waveform spectrum modulated on a frequency scale @xmath210 . if the two waveforms were not identical , we would expect modulation of the spectrum , but less than 100% modulation .",
    "this explanation can be tested on time - symmetric motion , where there are two well separated periods of ringing in in fig .",
    "[ poisson]a .",
    "the amplitudes of the ringing are different , of course , so we should nt expect 100% modulation of the spectrum and , indeed , the modulations in fig .",
    "[ poisson]b , are not 100% .",
    "the time shift between the first and second ringing periods is on the order of @xmath211 ( roughly the time it takes for the particle to rise up from @xmath212 to @xmath205 and fall back to @xmath212 ) .",
    "this suggests that the spacing of the spectral bumps should be @xmath213=0.84/2m$ ] , which is in good agreement with what is seen in fig .",
    "[ poisson]b .",
    "the application to a nonsymmetric waveform , like that in fig .",
    "[ hir0]a , is less obvious .",
    "the spacing of bumps @xmath214 in fig .",
    "[ hir0]c suggests that the time shift is on the order of @xmath215 .",
    "this , presumably , represents the time between the descent of the waveform at @xmath216 and the start of ringing at @xmath217 .",
    "the interpretation works as well as a predictor of the bump spacing for other values of @xmath1 , and seems clearly to be qualitatively correct , and to explain the progression of the spectra .",
    "as @xmath1 approaches the horizon , the time between the initial moment and the onset of ringing goes to zero , so the spacing of bumps is infinite and there are no modulations of the spectrum .",
    "we get the single - humped close - limit spectrum . as @xmath1 grows ,",
    "the time between the initial motion and the start of ringing increases , so the spacing of the bumps gets smaller , and hence more bumps appear .",
    "as @xmath1 is becoming larger , however , the early waveform is becoming less dramatic ( the initial depression is decreasing in amplitude ) so in interacting with the later ringing it is producing smaller modulation ; the height of the bumps is decreasing . finally , as @xmath218 , we can think of the spectrum approaching one that has an infinite number of infinitesimally spaced zero - height bumps , bumps that are invisible in the drpp spectrum .",
    "results for higher @xmath6-poles are shown in figs.[diffells ] .",
    "the waveforms for @xmath219 show a more complicated structure of the pre - ringing radiation , resulting in more complex spectra .",
    "the total energy radiated in different @xmath6-poles is shown in fig.[evl ] .",
    "results are given for several different values of @xmath1 , and for particles falling in from infinity , both with no initial velocity ( the drpp case ) and with @xmath220 .",
    "the distribution of energy among the multipoles is dominated by the quadrupole for small @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath188 increases to around 1.5 , the higher multipoles become more important , but with further increase of @xmath188 to @xmath189 the trend is reversed , and the ratio of multipole energies take on values that remain constant for further increases in @xmath1 . for infall from infinity , the ultrarelativistic cases , with high @xmath221 ,",
    "radiate more heavily in higher multipoles , as would be expected .",
    "to find the total energy , given in fig .",
    "[ evdist ] , we computed energy radiated in @xmath222 modes and assumed that the energies from each @xmath6 decreased as a geometric series .",
    "this allowed us to add an estimate of the contributions from @xmath223 .",
    "the addition was typically around 2% of the energy .",
    "the energy is plotted as a function of proper distance @xmath224 , rather than @xmath1 , to show more clearly the details for small separation .",
    "aspects of infall from infinity are given in fig .",
    "[ gammas ] , which shows waveforms and spectra .",
    "the waveforms are characterized by a large early amplitude that is an increasing function of @xmath225 , and the spectra show strong low frequency radiation , extending to @xmath109 , due to this early phase of the radiation .",
    "the total energy radiated in the lowest three multipoles is also shown .",
    "( since the relative importance of higher multipoles increases with @xmath221 , extrapolation to total radiated energy is not immediate . )",
    "the energy results are extended to include infall from finite radius where @xmath181 takes the value @xmath51 .",
    "one of the interesting questions that can be clarified with the above results is the validity of the close approximation .",
    "this approximation , for two holes , assumes that the holes are initially close enough so that the structure of the initial data at small radius is inside an initial all - encompassing horizon .",
    "only the large @xmath8 features of the initial data therefore are relevant to the production of outgoing radiation .",
    "we can immediately apply this method to the particle problem by comparing our initial geometry , in ( [ ivmetric ] ) and ( [ fform ] ) , with the initial geometry in equation ( 4.25 ) of ref .",
    "we see that the results of that reference can be applied to the particle problem by the replacement @xmath226 with ( [ z2eq ] ) and ( [ massreln ] ) this can be rewritten as @xmath227 by the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath228 , the radiated energy in units of @xmath229 , for each multipole , is shown to be @xmath230 , respectively for @xmath231 .",
    "if we replace @xmath232 with ( [ replace ] ) we find the close limit predictions for energy . in refs .",
    "@xcite the outgoing radiation is computed from an evolution of @xmath233 , using a finite difference representation of ( [ rtzerilli ] ) ( with no source term ) .",
    "here we have also computed waveforms and energies in the close limit directly by the transform methods of secs .",
    "ii and iii , with only the following changes : the integrals @xmath158 are omitted from ( [ sofar ] ) , and only the @xmath75 form of @xmath234 is used in ( [ fform ] ) .",
    "the results of the two methods are energy values that agree to better than 1% and waveforms that are almost indistinguishable .",
    "( the numerically evolved waveforms are rather smoother than the waveforms from the transform method .",
    "they lack the small amplitude wiggles that can be seen , e.g. , in the waveform in fig .",
    "[ smallr0]a at early times . )    in fig .",
    "[ closelim ] , we plot the @xmath27 close - limit energy prediction and compare it to the full computation for the particle infall .",
    "it is clear that the close limit method is acceptable out to @xmath235 , and fails by a large factor at @xmath236 .",
    "this is in accord with the general picture that the close limit should be a reasonably good approximation when the particle starts inside the peak , around @xmath237 , of the potential ( [ zpotential ] ) .",
    "the waveforms in the close limit all have precisely the same shape ; only the amplitudes differ .",
    "the computed waveforms are in excellent agreement with the small @xmath1 waveforms ( see , e.g. , the waveforms for @xmath212 in fig .  [",
    "smallr0]a ) .",
    "the close - limit predictions of waveform shape are even better than the energy predictions . only for @xmath188 larger than around 1.5",
    "does the waveform start to change from the close - limit shape .",
    "the dependence of radiated energy on @xmath1 , shown in fig.[evdist ] , is perhaps the most interesting result of our computations .",
    "one has an intuitive instinct that the radiated energy should decrease with decreasing @xmath1 . at the crudest level this intuition",
    "is based on the idea that infall from a larger radius results in a particle which `` strikes '' the black hole harder and excites more quasinormal ringing . since a decrease of energy with smaller @xmath1 is expected , a natural first guess for approximating the decrease is to multiply the drpp energy by a reduction factor @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is some fitting parameter of order unity .",
    "this approximation , with @xmath240 is shown in fig.[farapprox ] and is compared with the computed results , and with the drpp limit .",
    "the choice @xmath240 was made to give good agreement at @xmath10 , and presumably at larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "( it is difficult to compute energies at much larger values of @xmath1 , due to the rapid modulation of the spectrum . )",
    "a more physical justification for decrease of radiation with decreasing @xmath1 can be constructed starting with the quadrupole formula .",
    "a faster moving particle from a larger @xmath1 implies a larger value of the time derivatives of the quadrupole moment .",
    "this argument has been used@xcite as the basis of a simple quantitative model for the effect of varying @xmath1 .",
    "the energy for infall from infinity , in that model , is reduced by a reduction factor @xmath241 based on the quadrupole formula .",
    "( 23 ) of ref .",
    "( for large @xmath1 that reduction factor reduces to @xmath242 . ) in fig .",
    "[ farapprox ] , we show the result of that simple model .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath241 factor captures the correct qualitative feature of a decrease of radiation with decrease of @xmath1 but implies too dramatic a decrease .    as @xmath1 continues to decrease",
    ", a rather unexpected effect appears .",
    "below @xmath243 the energy begins to increase with decreasing separation . at",
    "yet smaller radii ( @xmath1 less than around 4.5 m ) the energy again decreases with decreasing @xmath1 , as the close limit dictates it must .",
    "thus the relationship of radiated energy and @xmath1 has the expected nature in the two regimes where simple arguments apply : large separations and small separations . the anomalous behavior in the range @xmath244@xmath245 underscores the fact that the generation of outgoing radiation is tied closely to the nature of the potential ( [ zpotential ] ) , which peaks around @xmath236 , and can not be understood in terms of close or far approximations .",
    "this anomaly , it should be noted , appears to have no equivalent feature in the case of the head - on collision of two equal mass holes@xcite .",
    "presumably this is because the replacement of the particle by a hole means that the infalling hole is not localized at a particular value of the potential of the other hole .",
    "as the mass ratio of the infalling holes becomes smaller and smaller there must come a point at which an anomalous bump develops in the dependence of radiation on initial separation .",
    "we have seen that the particle limit provides a relatively easy tool for understanding some aspects of the generation of radiation , and of the collisions of holes .",
    "we intend next to use this formalism to study what features on initial data are important to determining how much energy is radiated for particle infall , and presumably for black hole collisions .",
