    "the classical wks sampling theorem has been extended to the case of nonuniform sampling by numerous authors . for detailed information on the theory and its numerous applications ,",
    "we refer to the book @xcite .",
    "most known irregular sampling results deal with paley  wiener functions which have @xmath2 restrictions on the real line .",
    "it seems that the best known nonuniform wks sampling results for entire functions in @xmath3spaces were given in @xcite .",
    "there are no multidimensional @xmath3wks sampling theorems with precise truncation error estimates in open literature",
    ". however , explicit truncation error upper bounds in multidimensional wks reconstructions are of great importance in signal and image processing .",
    "alternative reconstruction approaches for irregular sampling problems were developed in @xcite .",
    "however , due to long traditions the wks type reconstructions still play key role in applied signal and image processing .",
    "new numerical methods for quick sinc  series summations ( see , for example ,",
    "@xcite ) let more efficient usage of wks formulae than before . on the other hand wks type results are important not only because of signal processing applications .",
    "wks theorems are equivalent to many key results in mathematics , see , e.g. @xcite . therefore they are also valuable for theoretical studies",
    ". it explains why in spite of substantial progress in modern approximation methods wks type reconstructions are still of great importance and vast amount of new refine results are published regularly .",
    "in this paper we use approaches and methods developed in @xcite to investigate multidimensional irregular sampling in @xmath3-spaces .",
    "let @xmath4 be a normed space and assume that the structure of @xmath4 admits the sampling approximation procedure @xmath5 where @xmath6 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the sampling set and the sampling function respectively .",
    "this formula is one of the basic tools in signal processing .    in direct numerical implementations",
    "we consider the truncated variant of ( [ 1 ] ) , reads as follows : @xmath9 where the index set @xmath10 is finite by application reasons .",
    "namely , recovering a continuous signal from discrete samples or assessing the information lost in the sampling process are the fundamental problems in sampling and interpolation theory .",
    "the usual procedure is to estimate the truncation error @xmath11 where @xmath12 could stay for different norms on different sides of this relation and @xmath13 denotes the truncation error upper bound .",
    "simple truncation error upper bounds are the main tools in numerical implementations , when they do not contain infinite products and/or unknown function values .",
    "however , the suitably sharp truncation error upper bound enables pointwise , almost sure , uniform _ etc . _ type convergence of the approximating sequence @xmath14 to initial @xmath15 .",
    "the main aim of this paper is for @xmath16 to discuss @xmath17 by getting pointwise upper bounds valid for all @xmath18 on the whole range of the signal domain without strong assumptions on the decay rate of @xmath19 see @xcite .",
    "this kind of upper bounds we call _",
    "universal_.    the most frequent rearrangement of in the literature is of the form @xmath20 @xmath21 being a conjugated hlder pair , i.e. @xmath22 .    to make the approximant @xmath14 more precise let us assume @xmath23 , that is , that the sampling index set @xmath24 depends on the location of time parameter @xmath18 with respect to the behaviour of @xmath25 in estimating @xmath26 see @xcite .",
    "that means @xmath27 is _ a fortiori _ time shifted and possesses time adapted sampling size .    to obtain a class of truncation error upper bounds when",
    "the decay rate of the initial signal function is not known one operates with the straightforward @xmath28 where @xmath29 is suitable absolute constant .",
    "thus becomes @xmath30 we are interested in estimates for @xmath31 such that vanish with @xmath32 therefore , the obtained upper bounds really will be universal for wide classes of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "denote @xmath35 the @xmath36-norm in finite case ( while @xmath37 and @xmath38 the set of all functions whose restrictions to @xmath39 have finite @xmath36-norm .",
    "assume @xmath40 be of exponential type @xmath41 and let @xmath42 be a separated real sequence , i.e. such that @xmath43 then it holds true ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 76 ) ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 the display ( [ pp ] ) exposes the celebrated plancherel ",
    "plya inequality , see @xcite .",
    "it could be mentioned that boas @xcite has been established another estimate in one  dimensional case under different assumptions on @xmath34 , and recently lindner publishes an estimate in onedimensional case when @xmath46 @xcite .    here",
    ", we will give the multidimensional analog of the plancherel  plya inequality .",
    "hereinafter @xmath47 denotes the bernstein class @xcite of @xmath48variable entire functions of exponential type at most @xmath49 coordinatewise whose restriction to @xmath50 is in @xmath51 .",
    "[ th1 ] let @xmath52 be real separated sequence , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath55 where @xmath56    take @xmath57 ; the proof will be identical in the case @xmath58 .    from the assumption @xmath59 and the inequality of different dimensions @xcite which holds for @xmath60 follow that @xmath61 and @xmath62 therefore we can apply ( [ pp ] ) coordinatewise .",
    "because @xmath63 are separated with @xmath64 there holds @xmath65 second subsequent application of ( [ pp ] ) to ( [ delta2 ] ) yields @xmath66 where in ( [ delta1 ] ) the fubini s theorem is used . therefore , the assertion of theorem is proved .",
    "the case of wks sampling restoration by nonequidistantly spaced nodes @xmath67 is the so  called _ irregular sampling procedure_. in this case there is a doubt on the reality of analogue of regular sampling results on sharp estimates for truncation error upper bounds in uniform sampling ( for example , see @xcite ) , since @xmath68 is wandering together with @xmath18 , and therefore different time values @xmath18 generate windows with substantially different sampling sets .",
    "of course , this results in increasing magnitude of the truncation error @xcite .",
    "let @xmath69 . in @xcite",
    "it was considered a case when outside @xmath24 the time - jitter @xmath70 vanishes .",
    "these results can be generalized to multidimensional case .",
    "namely , having on mind the infinite product representation of sine  function and replacing the equidistant nodes having indices inside @xmath71 with the disturbed @xmath72 ones @xmath73 we get the so  called _ window canonical product sampling function _",
    "@xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath76 , being @xmath77 so , when @xmath34 is separated , one can deduce @xmath78 where the convergence is uniform on bounded subsets of @xmath50 under additional suitable conditions upon @xmath25 and @xmath34 .",
    "we will discuss the conditions for multidimensional case later ( see @xcite for onedimensional case ) . in this framework",
    "the sampling restoration procedure becomes of lagrange  yen type @xcite .",
    "for the general case of multidimensional irregular sampling with window canonical product sampling function @xmath79 we have time  jittered nodes outside @xmath24 as well .",
    "nonvanishing time - jitter @xmath70 outside @xmath24 leads to functions @xmath80 given by formulae different from ( [ 20 ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "however , in irregular sampling applications we would like to approximate @xmath33 using only it s values from sample nodes @xmath81 indexed by @xmath82 therefore we can try to use the truncated to @xmath83 sampling approximation sum @xmath84 with @xmath85 ( such that is given by ) even for arbitrary sample nodes outside @xmath24 . under such assumptions the _ truncation error _",
    "@xmath86 coincides with truncation error for the case given by .",
    "it would seem that in this framework @xmath87 depends on samples in @xmath88 , but it does not depend on samples in @xmath89 , which are used to build approximation sum @xmath90 . however , it is not true , because @xmath91 depends on nonvanishing @xmath70 in @xmath24 due to multiplicative form of ( [ 21 ] ) . therefore , the multidimensional sampling problems are more difficult than the one  dimensional ones . in this section",
    "we propose a way to obtain universal truncation bounds for multidimensional irregular sampling restoration procedure .",
    "first of all , we will give the multidimensional sampling theorem for @xmath92 functional class .",
    "denote @xmath93 assume that @xmath94 ; for all @xmath95 .",
    "[ th_ms ] let @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 for all @xmath99 @xmath100 be real separated sequence with @xmath101 then the sampling expansion ( [ 21 ] ) holds uniformly on each bounded @xmath18subset of @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , the series in ( [ 21 ] ) converges absolutely too .",
    "here , in , @xmath103 stands for the characteristic function of the random event @xmath104 .",
    "first @xmath34 is obviously separated since @xmath105 now , by the assumption @xmath106 and by the inequality of different dimensions @xcite we conclude @xmath107 . on the other hand we rewrite the function @xmath80 ( defined by ) into @xmath108 where @xmath109",
    "because @xmath80 has representation ( [ g ] ) , it is clear that all results of @xcite remain valid if one uses @xmath110 instead of @xmath111 , and make use of @xmath80 instead of @xmath112 , considered by hinsen @xcite .",
    "therefore , if ( [ m ] ) holds , we have @xmath113 we can subsequently apply the same sampling expansion formula ( [ s1 ] ) with respect to all variables @xmath114 on the right side of ( [ s1 ] ) , being ( [ s1 ] ) absolutely convergent for @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "this procedure results in absolute convergent @xmath48tuple series on the right in ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "the belonging truncation error upper bound result reads as follows .    [ th_ir ]",
    "let @xmath116 satisfy , @xmath117 for all @xmath73",
    ". then we have @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120    as we mentioned earlier in section 3 , the function @xmath90 does not depend on samples in @xmath88 and we assume that outside @xmath24 it is @xmath121 therefore , the structure of @xmath122 becomes uniform @xmath123 . in this case theorem  [ th_ms ]",
    "guarantees that @xmath33 admits the representation ( [ 21 ] ) , and the so evaluated model ( [ 4 ] ) gives us @xmath124 the multiplicative structure of @xmath125 enables to estimate @xmath31 in the following way @xmath126 let us estimate @xmath127 note , that due to our assumptions @xmath128 for all @xmath129 .",
    "hence @xmath130 where @xmath131 denotes the index closest to @xmath132 , i.e. @xmath133    due to @xmath134 we have @xmath135 and @xmath136 then , being @xmath137 let us estimate the first sum : @xmath138 and the second one as @xmath139 collecting all estimates ( [ est1])-([est5 ] ) , we conclude @xmath140 and hence @xmath141 thus , we proceed evaluating @xmath142 such that gives @xmath143 now , let us evaluate @xmath144 , the second addend in .",
    "note , that due to the declared assumptions of the theorem , we have @xmath145 let us consider the case @xmath146 .",
    "then @xmath147 as sinc@xmath148 decreases in @xmath149 $ ] , we get @xmath150 and the inequality ( [ est1 ] ) is valid in our case too .",
    "together with further necessary estimates , such as @xmath151 we deduce @xmath152 let us estimate the first sum as @xmath153 making use of to the second sum in we have @xmath154 combining all estimates ( [ est1])-([est5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath155 let us consider the case @xmath156 as sinc@xmath148 decreases , by ( [ est1 ] ) it follows @xmath157 hence , for @xmath158 we get @xmath159 because ( [ est3])-([est5 ] ) are still valid in this case as well . combining all upper bounds concerning @xmath160 we have @xmath161",
    "it remains to realize the estimate @xmath162 such that gives @xmath163 therefore , by ( [ 26 ] ) @xmath164 to estimate @xmath165 we use theorem  [ th1 ] with @xmath166 .",
    "this results in @xmath167 now , collecting all these involved estimates , we arrive at ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "denote @xmath168 and @xmath169    let us consider the paley - wiener space @xmath170 of all complex - valued @xmath171functions whose fourier spectrum is bandlimited to @xmath172^d$ ] .",
    "[ cor ] let @xmath173 @xmath97 @xmath116 satisfy ( [ m ] )",

    "in most papers known in literature ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references in them ) to obtain kotelnikov - shannons theorems and upper bounds for approximation errors in @xmath38 spaces various authors considered particular classes of functions with prescribed decay conditions which gave opportunity to estimated @xmath165 in ( [ 4 ] ) in such manner that the estimate vanishes when @xmath204 tends to infinity .",
    "the another term @xmath31 in ( [ 4 ] ) usually was estimated by some constant which did not depend on @xmath205    in this paper we propose estimates for @xmath31 which depends on @xmath204 and vanishes when @xmath204 tends to infinity .",
