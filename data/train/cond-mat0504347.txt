    "strikingly ,  there are conditions where the decoherence rate  can become perturbation independent.@xcite this phenomenon is interpreted @xcite as the onset of a lyapunov phase , where @xmath18   $ ] is controlled by the system s own complexity @xmath19 . describing such a transition , requires expressing the observables ( outputs ) in terms of the controlled parameters and interactions ( inputs ) beyond the perturbation theory .",
    "we are going to show that this is also the case of the simple swapping gate , an essential building block for quantum information processing , where puzzling experiments require a substantially improved description .",
    "while the swapping operation was recently addressed in the field of nmr in liquids @xcite with a focus on quantum computation , the pioneer experiments were performed in solid state nmr @xcite by mller , kumar , baumann and ernst ( mkbe ) .",
    "they obtained a swapping frequency @xmath6 determined by a two - spin dipolar interaction @xmath20 , and a decoherence rate @xmath21 that , in their model , was fixed by interactions with the environment @xmath22 .",
    "this dynamical description was obtained by solving a generalized liouville - von neumann equation . as usual , the degrees of freedom of the environment were traced out to yield a quantum master equation.@xcite more recent experiments , spanning the internal interaction strength @xcite hinted that there is a critical value of this interaction when a drastic change in the behavior of the swapping frequency and relaxation rates occurs . since this is not predicted by the standard approximations in the quantum master equation,@xcite this motivates to deepen into the physics of the phenomenon .    in this paper , we present a set of @xmath23c-@xmath24h cross - polarization nmr data , swept over a wide range of a control parameter ( the ratio between internal interactions and se interaction strengths ) .",
    "these results clearly show that the transition _ _ between the two expected dynamical regimes for the @xmath23c polarization , an oscillating regime and an over - damped regime , is not a smooth cross - over .",
    "indeed , it has the characteristics of critical phenomena where a divergence of the oscillation period at a given critical strength of the control parameter is indicative of the nonanalyticity of this observable.@xcite the data are interpreted by solving the swapping dynamics between two coupled spins ( qubits ) interacting with a spin bath . with this purpose",
    "the environment is represented as a stroboscopic process . with certain probability ,",
    "this instantaneous interaction interrupts the system evolution through measurements and/or injections . this simple picture , emerging naturally @xcite from the quantum theory of irreversible processes in the keldysh formalism,@xcite enables us to distinguish the interaction parts that lead to dissipation from those giving pure decoherence . within this picture ,",
    "the overdamped regime arises because of the quantum zeno effect,@xcite i.e. environment measures  the system so frequently that prevents evolution .",
    "the analytical solution confirms that there is a critical value of the control parameter where a bifurcation occurs .",
    "this is associated with the switch among dynamical regimes : the _ swapping _ _ phase _ and the _",
    "zeno phase_. in consequence , we call this phenomenon a _ quantum dynamical phase transition_.",
    "our cross polarization experiments exploit the fact that in polycrystalline ferrocene fe(c@xmath25h@xmath25)@xmath26 , one can select a pair of interacting spins , i.e. a @xmath23c and its directly bonded @xmath24h , arising on a molecule with a particular orientation .",
    "this is because the cyclopentadienyl rings perform fast thermal rotations ( @xmath27 @xmath28 ) around the five - fold symmetry axis , leading to a time averaged @xmath23c-@xmath24h interaction .",
    "the new dipolar constant depends @xcite only on the angle @xmath29 between the molecular axis and the external magnetic field @xmath30 and the angles between the internuclear vectors and the rotating axis , which in this case are 90@xmath31 .",
    "thus , the effective coupling constant is @xmath32 where @xmath33 s are the gyromagnetic factors and @xmath34 the internuclear distance .",
    "notice that @xmath35 cancels out at the magic angle @xmath36 as the chemical shift anisotropy of @xmath23c is also averaged by the rotation and also depends on @xmath29 as @xmath37 it is straightforward to assign each frequency in the @xmath23c spectrum to a dipolar coupling @xmath20",
    ". thus , all possible @xmath20 values are present in a single polycrystalline spectrum .",
    "the swapping induced by @xmath20 is turned on during the contact time  @xmath38 , when the sample is irradiated with two radio frequencies fulfilling the hartmann - hahn condition.@xcite experimental details have been given elsewhere.@xcite at @xmath39 there is no polarization at @xmath23c while the @xmath24h system is polarized . the polarization is transferred forth and back in the @xmath23c-@xmath24h pairs while the other protons inject polarization into these pairs . in fig .",

    "the polarizations have been normalized to their respective values at the maximum contact time ( @xmath40 ) for each @xmath29 when it saturates .",
    "it can be appreciated in the figure that the oscillation frequency is roughly proportional to @xmath41 showing that this is the dominant interaction in the dynamics .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that  the next @xmath23c-@xmath24h coupling strength with a non - directly bonded proton is roughly @xmath42 and , as all the intramolecular interactions , also scales with the angular factor @xmath43 .",

    "this divergence is the signature of a critical behavior .",
    "the standard procedure to characterize the cross polarization experiment in ferrocene and similar compounds@xcite is derived from the mkbe model .",

    "a drawback of this simple characterization is that it tends to overestimate the width of the canyon because of limitations of the fitting procedure when eq .",
    "( [ eq - mkbe ] ) is used around the magic angle .",
    "[ h ]    fig2.eps    in spite of the mkbe theoretical prediction , one observes that the frequency becomes zero abruptly and the relaxation rate suddenly drops with a quadratic behavior when @xmath57 .",

    "this has to be compared with the almost constant value of @xmath60 @xmath56 observed outside the magic angle neighborhood .",

    "we are very grateful to richard r. ernst , who drove our attention to the puzzling nature of our early experiments .",
    "we benefited from discussions with lucio frydman , who suggested experimental settings where these results are relevant , as well as stimulating comments from alex pines during a stay of prl and hmp at the weizmann institute of science .",

    "moreover , keeping @xmath8 constant , under the conditions of finite @xmath225 _ _ and _ _ @xmath226 _ _ ( here @xmath77 is a mean intra - bath interaction ) there is no significant difference between the stroboscopic approximation and the continuous time description .",
