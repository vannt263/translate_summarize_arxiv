    "treating quantum field theories in 1 + 1 dimensions as a test laboratory for realistic theories in higher dimensions , this paper is concerned with the general question of how to enlarge a given finite particle spectrum of a theory to an infinite one .    in general the bootstrap @xcite , which is the construction principle for the scattering matrix ,",
    "is assumed to close after a finite number of steps , which means it involves a finite number of particles .",
    "however , from a physical as well as from a mathematical point of view , it appears to be natural to extend the construction in such a way that it would involve an infinite number of particles .",
    "the physical motivation for this are string theories , which admit an infinite particle spectrum .",
    "mathematically the infinite bootstrap would be an analogy to infinite dimensional groups , in the sense that two entries of the s - matrix are combined into a third , which is again a member of the same infinite set .",
    "it appears to us that it is impossible to construct an infinite bootstrap system involving asymptotic states and find the mathematical analogue to infinite groups in this sense ( see also footnote 2 and the paragraph after figure 1 ) .",
    "however , it is possible to introduce an infinite number of unstable particles into the spectrum .",
    "scattering matrices which would allow such type of interpretation have occurred in the literature @xcite , although only in the latter paper a reference to unstable particles has been made . in @xcite these matrices were found to be expressible in terms of elliptic functions , a feature very common in the context of lattice models , e.g.@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to suggest a general construction principle for such type of s - matrices starting from some known theory with a finite particle spectrum of a special , albeit quite generic , form .",
    "as particular examples we provide elliptic generalizations of scattering matrices related to a pair of lie algebras @xcite , which contain the affine toda s - matrices @xcite and homogeneous sine - gordon s - matrices @xcite for particular choices of the algebras .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we provide a general principle for the construction of scattering matrices which involve an infinite number of unstable particles and present some explicit examples . in section iii we construct renormalization group ( rg ) scaling functions by means of the c - theorem and the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) for the generalization of the sinh - gordon model . our conclusions and an outlook towards open problems are stated in section iv .",
    "let us consider the huge class of two - particle s - matrices , which describe the scattering between particles of type @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of the rapidity difference @xmath2 , of the general form @xmath3 here @xmath4 denotes the so - called minimal s - matrix which satisfies the consistency relations @xcite , namely unitarity , crossing and the fusing bootstrap equations and possibly possess poles on the imaginary axis in the sheet @xmath5 , which is physical for asymptotic states .",
    "the cdd - factor @xcite , referred to as @xmath6 , also satisfies these equations , but has its poles in the sheet @xmath7 , which is the `` physical one '' for resonance states .",
    "@xmath8 might depend on additional constants like the effective coupling constant or a resonance parameter . a simple prescription to introduce now an infinite number of resonance poles",
    "is to replace the cdd - factor in ( [ fact ] ) by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is taken to be real . by construction the new s - matrix",
    ", @xmath11 satisfies the bootstrap consistency equations and possible poles in the sheet @xmath7 have now been duplicated @xmath12 times within this sheet , such that they admit an interpretation as unstable particles .",
    "therefore , when @xmath13 we have an infinite number of resonance poles .",
    "since , as a consequence of crossing and unitarity , the s - matrix is known to be a @xmath14-periodic function , a property shared individually by @xmath15 ,  we expect to recover a double periodic function in the limit @xmath16 @xmath17 for @xmath18 . at this stage",
    "it is not clear whether the prescription ( [ pr ] ) is meaningful at all , in the sense that it leads to meaningful quantum field theories , and in particular one has to be concerned about the convergence of the infinite product in ( [ prin ] ) .",
    "since @xmath19  is a double periodic function we expect that it is somehow related to elliptic functions ( see e.g. @xcite for their properties ) .",
    "let us therefore now look concretely at the building blocks which can be used to make up the entire scattering matrix in the non - elliptic case , when backscattering is absent . in that case",
    "the s - matrices are diagonal and known @xcite to be of the general form @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . a specific theory",
    "is then characterized by the finite set @xmath23 together with the bootstrap leads to a finite set @xmath23 and therefore a finite number of asymptotic states .",
    "taking instead @xmath24 could possibly lead to an infinite number , but a consistent closure of the bootstrap is not known up to now . ] .",
    "this means , if we demonstrate that the prescription ( [ prin ] ) is meaningful for each individual building block @xmath25 as defined in ( [ gen ] ) , in particular we need to demonstrate the convergence of the infinite product , we have established that it is sensible for the entire scattering matrix .",
    "for this purpose we note the identity @xmath26 here we abbreviated @xmath27 and used the jacobian elliptic functions in the standard notation @xmath28 with p , q @xmath29s , c , d , n@xmath30 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the quarter periods @xmath31 depending on the parameter @xmath32 $ ] are defined in the usual way through the complete elliptic integral @xmath33 the period of @xmath34 is chosen to be @xmath35 .",
    "the last identity in ( [ bl1 ] ) is easily derived from the infinite product representations of the elliptic functions which can be found in various places as for instance in @xcite @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "recalling the well known limits @xmath39 and @xmath40 we obtain @xmath41 this means in the limit @xmath42 the elliptic s - matrix @xmath43 collapses to the hyperbolic one , that is @xmath44 . notice that due to the general identity @xmath45 , we could also write ( [ bl1 ] ) in terms of various other combinations of elliptic functions .",
    "for instance replacing @xmath46 by @xmath47 is probably most intuitive , since it allows an alternative prescription to ( [ prin ] ) for the construction of elliptic scattering matrices : replace @xmath48 , @xmath49 and correct the consistency equations by a factor @xmath50 , which reduces always to @xmath51 in the hyperbolic limit , in such a way that no resonance poles are left inside the physical sheet .",
    "defining now the function @xmath52 the singularities of @xmath34 are easily identified as @xmath53 note that when taking @xmath54 the poles are situated in the non - physical sheet .",
    "this brings us to the question of how to interpret these poles and how can we characterize the physical properties of the related particles ? considering the s - matrix @xmath44 , which describes the scattering of two particles of type @xmath55and @xmath1 with masses @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we assume that there is a resonance pole situated at @xmath58 . according to the breit - wigner formula @xcite ( see also e.g. @xcite ) the mass @xmath59 and the decay width @xmath60 of an unstable particle of type @xmath61 can be conveniently expressed as @xmath62 where @xmath63 we keep here in mind that this description , although frequently used e.g. @xcite , is not entirely rigorous and requires additional investigation .",
    "this caution is based on various facts .",
    "first , the relations ( [ brw ] ) are simply derived by carrying over a prescription from usual quantum mechanics to quantum field theory , i.e. complexifying the mass of a stable particle .",
    "second , solving the breit - wigner formula for the quantities @xmath59 , @xmath64 and treating them literally as mass and decay width is somewhat problematic since this is in conflict with heisenberg s uncertainty principle , because apparently we know simultaneously the energy and the time .",
    "third , the breit - wigner relations presume an exponential decay in momentum space , which is in fact incompatible with the general principles of quantum field theory and therefore might possibly be a problem in this context @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we employ these quantities and try to find evidence to support that they are indeed meaningful .",
    "when taking @xmath59 to be the mass of the unstable particle there should be a threshold for energetic reasons of the type @xmath65 with the consequence that the decay width is bounded by @xmath66 so far evidence for these thresholds has not been found in the literature .",
    "one reason for this is that the unstable particles enter the bootstrap principle in a more passive way than the stable particles , whose properties are directly used in the construction procedure .",
    "hence one expects that signs for these thresholds will emerge in a more indirect way .",
    "a summary of our statements about the pole structure of @xmath67 is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "figure 1 : the poles of the blocks @xmath68 are the crosses in the sheet @xmath7 .",
    "the crosses on the positive part of the imaginary axis are associated , as usual , with stable particles .",
    "for equal masses of the stable particles the threshold ( [ th1 ] ) is @xmath69.\\medskip $ ]     since the poles inside the sheet @xmath5 are associated to @xmath4 , it is also obvious from figure 1 why the prescription ( [ pr ] ) may not be employed for this part of the s - matrix , since it would lead to a pole structure which is , according to ( [ brw ] ) , non physical for @xmath59 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is clear by construction that our prescription includes all affine toda field theories related to simply laced lie algebras , since they all factorize as ( [ fact ] ) and may be represented in the form ( [ gen ] ) , see e.g. @xcite . taking the resonance parameter @xmath71 to be zero and the set @xmath72 for @xmath73 , we recover as a special case the elliptic version of the sinh - gordon model proposed in @xcite . reintroducing @xmath71",
    ", its scattering matrix reads @xmath74 according to ( [ brw ] ) the masses and decay width of the unstable particles are @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the mass of the stable particle .",
    "the thresholds ( [ th1 ] ) and ( [ th2 ] ) translate in this case into @xmath77 as a further example we consider the elliptic generalization of the @xmath78-theory ( @xmath79-homogeneous sine - gordon model ) .",
    "the two - particle s - matrix describing the scattering of two stable particles of type @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath80 , related to the non - elliptic version of this model was proposed in @xcite . in our notation",
    "it may be written as @xmath81 ^{i_{ab}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{zams}\\ ] ] here @xmath82 denotes the incidence matrix of the @xmath83-dynkin diagram , the resonance parameters have the property @xmath84 and @xmath85 depending on whether @xmath0 is even or odd . according to our prescription outlined in the previous paragraph ,",
    "the elliptic generalization of ( [ zams ] ) is @xmath86 ^{i_{ab}}\\,.\\ ] ] note that despite the appearance of the square root , @xmath87 as well as @xmath88 are still meromorphic functions in @xmath2 .",
    "having established that our prescription leads to sensible solutions of the bootstrap consistency equations , we would also like to know what kind of quantum field theories these scattering matrices correspond to . up to now all known solutions to the on - shell consistency equations have led to sensible qft s , albeit a rigorous proof which would establish that indeed _ all _ solutions are well - defined local qft s is still an outstanding issue .",
    "some crucial characteristics of the theory are contained in the renormalization group scaling functions , which we now want to determine . in particular , we want to identify in the extreme ultraviolet limit the virasoro central charges of the corresponding conformal field theories .",
    "we carry out this task by evaluating the c - theorem @xcite in the version presented in @xcite @xmath89 the sum of the on - shell energies is here denoted by @xmath90 , with @xmath91 being the masses of the theory and the correlation function for the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath92 has been expanded in terms of @xmath93-particle form factors @xmath94 ( see @xcite for general properties and @xcite for explicit sinh - gordon formulae ) .",
    "we normalized @xmath92 and @xmath91 by an overall mass scale , such that @xmath95 as well as the renormalization group parameter @xmath96 become dimensionless .",
    "in particular @xmath97 is the ultraviolet virasoro central charge .",
    "let us now start with the evaluation of @xmath98 as defined in ( [ cr0 ] ) for the elliptic version of the sinh - gordon model . as the input for this",
    "we need to know the @xmath93-particle form factors .",
    "since so far it is not known how to compute the sum in @xmath93 analytically , we have to resort to a numerical treatment and it is clear that we have to terminate the series at a certain value of @xmath93 .",
    "fortunately , it was observed explicitly in @xcite , that in fact the expression for @xmath99 is already very close to the exact answer for the sinh - gordon model .",
    "we assume here that the convergence behaviour is still true when we generalize the scattering matrix to ( [ esg ] ) .",
    "note that in general one has to be careful with this approximation , since the higher particle contributions are crucial in some models in order to obtain a good approximation to @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "in the two - particle approximation , indicated by the superscript , one can perform one of the integrations analytically and ( [ cr0 ] ) acquires the simple form @xmath100 it is here crucial to note that besides the formulation of @xmath88 in terms of elliptic functions for @xmath16 , it can also be expressed equivalently in terms of the usual sinh - gordon s - matrix ( [ bl1 ] ) .",
    "when trying to solve now the form factor consistency equations @xcite , we can exploit this observation .",
    "since for the model at hand there is neither a kinematic nor a bound state pole in @xmath101 , the only equations to be solved are watson s equations .",
    "the two particle form factor is then easily obtained to be @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the minimal form factor of the sinh - gordon model obtained in @xcite @xmath104 \\ , .",
    "\\label{fe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the infinite product representation for @xmath103 @xcite the solution ( [ coj ] ) for @xmath16 coincides with the equation ( 5.3 ) in @xcite .",
    "proceeding now to the evaluation of ( [ cr0 ] ) , we require @xmath105 , whose characteristics are captured in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2 : absolute value squared of the two particle form factors f@xmath106 as functions of the rapidity for different values of @xmath107  for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we observe that for a certain value of @xmath107 the function starts to converge , which is of course important from a technical point of view when we want to compute the limiting case @xmath16 .",
    "the other observation we make in figure 2 , see also figure 5 in @xcite , is that f@xmath110 always has a distinct maximum , which we refer to as @xmath111 . from ( [ fe ] )",
    "follows that it is determined by the solution of @xmath112 solving this equation for various values of @xmath113 , we find that @xmath111 is always slightly greater than the smallest threshold bound obtained from ( [ tresh ] ) .",
    "for instance for @xmath109 we obtain @xmath114 and @xmath115 and for @xmath116 we have @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "we interpret this as an indication that the form factors `` know '' about the thresholds ( [ tresh ] ) .",
    "we support this now by considering  @xmath119 f@xmath120 for various values of @xmath10 .",
    "figure 3 : absolute value squared of minimal form factors g@xmath121 as functions of the rapidity for different values of @xmath122 and @xmath109@xmath123        figure 4 : integrand of equation ( [ thefamouskink ] ) , that is h@xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath119 @xmath126 as a function of the rapidity for different values of @xmath10 and @xmath109 .",
    "we observe that in the region in which the factor @xmath127 , emerging in ( [ thefamouskink ] ) , is still non vanishing the integrals @xmath128 @xmath129 are decreasing functions of @xmath10 .",
    "this behaviour is changed once we take @xmath130 as we can explicitly extract from figure 4 .",
    "naturally this features are also reflected in the scaling functions .",
    "presuming that for each value of @xmath107 we have a consistent theory , we would like to know which ultraviolet central charges these models possess and in addition we want to identify a value of @xmath107 for which the related model constitutes reasonably good approximation for the elliptic models . that such an identification is possible",
    "is exhibited in figure 5 .",
    "in addition we observe , that for fixed @xmath10 and @xmath113 the scaling function is a monotonically increasing when @xmath107 is varied .",
    "figure 5 : ultraviolet virasoro central charge @xmath131  as a function of @xmath107 .",
    "focussing now on the elliptic case , that is we select a large enough @xmath107 such that this case is well approximated , we compute the scaling function in dependence of @xmath10 for various values of @xmath96 .",
    "our results are depicted in figure 6 .",
    "figure 6 : ultraviolet virasoro central charge @xmath131  as a function of @xmath10 .    in the extreme limits we obtain @xmath132 @xmath133 and for large @xmath10",
    "we recover the values of the sinh - gordon model , @xmath134 .",
    "the latter limit follows from ( [ aa ] ) and is in addition compatible with @xmath135 .",
    "the values for the extremal points were already quoted in @xcite , however , we also observe that the function is not monotonically increasing between these points as claimed in there .",
    "in fact , in the physical region , that is for values of @xmath136 the function is monotonically decreasing and does not take on values between @xmath137 and @xmath51 .",
    "remarkably , the threshold is quite clearly exhibited by a drastic change in the behaviour of @xmath138 , that is the onset of a small plateau as is visible in figure 6 .",
    "we performed the same computation for different values of @xmath113 and observed that this onset moves in the direction predicted by equation ( [ tresh ] ) .",
    "let us now compare the results of the previous section with an alternative method , namely the thermodynamic bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "for this we first have to solve the tba - equations @xmath139 for the function @xmath140 .",
    "the information of the scattering matrix is captured in the kernel @xmath141 of the rapidity convolution , which is denoted as usual by @xmath142 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath143 is the inverse temperature @xmath144 times the overall mass scale of the lightest particle @xmath145 .",
    "also all masses have been normalized in this way , i.e. @xmath146 . having determined the @xmath140-functions , we may compute the scaling function by means of @xmath147 once again @xmath148 is the ultraviolet virasoro central charge",
    ". we would like to recall here that the scaling functions @xmath149 and @xmath150 are not identical , but contain qualitatively the same information in the rg sense .    in order to carry out this analysis we need to know in ( [ tba ] ) the kernel @xmath151 as input .",
    "for the model under consideration we can exploit the factorization property ( [ esg ] ) for a finite product and trivially obtain @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the sinh - gordon kernel , e.g. @xcite @xmath154 using alternatively the representation of the s - matrix ( [ esg ] ) in terms of elliptic functions , we compute the kernel directly to @xmath155 \\,\\ , .   \\label{beauty}\\ ] ] with these expression we carry out our numerical analysis , that is we solve iteratively the equation ( [ tba ] ) and evaluate ( [ scale ] ) thereafter .",
    "the results of this investigations are presented in figure 7 .",
    "unfortunately for very small values of @xmath10 and @xmath96 our numerical iteration procedure does not converge reliably . however , we will be content at this stage with the data obtained so far , since they already support qualitative our c - theorem analysis .",
    "they confirm that above threshold the scaling function is monotonically decreasing as a function of @xmath10 and also that values greater than 1 may be reached , even for finite values of @xmath96 .",
    "figure 7 : tba scaling function .",
    "starting from a given scattering matrix of hyperbolic type , we have demonstrated that it is possible to include consistently an arbitrary number of unstable particles into the spectrum of the theory . in particular",
    "when this number becomes infinite the s - matrix may be expressed in terms of elliptic functions .    for the generalization of the sinh - gordon model we computed rg scaling functions .",
    "within these analysis we found clear evidence for the thresholds which constrain the masses of the unstable particles . above threshold , the values the ultraviolet virasoro central charges may take are between 1 and 2 ( possibly slightly greater than 2 ) and not between 0 and 1 as suggested in @xcite . the theories are consistent for each finite value of @xmath107 . for fixed resonance parameters @xmath10 and @xmath71 the scaling functions are non - decreasing for increasing @xmath107 .    concerning the investigation of the c - theorem , it would be desirable to refine the analysis .",
    "in particular one should include higher @xmath93-particle form factors into the expansion .",
    "for the elliptic version some of them were already presented in @xcite , but in general it remains a challenge to find closed expressions for arbitrary particle numbers . at present",
    "the tba analysis is the least conclusive exploration and deserves further consideration in future .",
    "in particular the regions of @xmath10 and @xmath156 which were not accessible to us , should be explored and might possibly lead to a further more concrete indication of the thresholds also in this context . in regard to this , it will be useful develop existence criteria for the solution of the tba equations analogue to the one derived in @xcite . the one presented in there",
    "can not be taken over directly , since it makes use of the fact that @xmath157 equals @xmath158 , whereas for the model investigated here this is @xmath159",
    ". it would be desirable to develop analytic approximations for the tba solutions in the extreme ultraviolet limit , i.e. @xmath160 , similar to the ones already existing for theories with different characteristic features .",
