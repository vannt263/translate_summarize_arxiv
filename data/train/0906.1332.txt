    "the problem of a charged quantum particle in the presence of a constant magnetic field is of great interest in the field of quantum hall effect @xcite , high temperature superconductivity @xcite , diamagnetism @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , atomic physics @xcite , two dimensional electronic systems @xcite .",
    "the issue that we addres in this paper is what happens to the quantum thermodynamic functions ( qtf ) of a charged quantum particle in the presence of an external constant magnetic field when it is in contact with a dissipative quantum heat bath .",
    "this kind of analysis is related with the dissipative quantum mechanics , a subject that has seen a great attention through the work of leggett and others @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches for the treatment of dissipative quantum systems .",
    "the most convensional approach is system plus reservoir point of view i.e. the system of interest is coupled linearly with the environment which is represented by a collection of harmonic oscillators @xcite . usually , one is interested in the dissipative subsystem and the reservoir variables are eliminated by projection operator or tracing procedure @xcite . as a result of that ,",
    "the reservoir enters only through few parameters .",
    "the results obtained from these kind of dissipative quantum systems are of great interest due to the recent widespread interest on the critical role of environmental effects in mesoscopic systems @xcite , in fundamental quantum physics , and in quantum information @xcite .",
    "in last few years , research on the open quantum systems has questioned about validity of fundamental laws of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "these subtle issues are discussed in details by several authors @xcite . here",
    ", our goal is not to survey all these subtle issues , but we focus on the effect of environment and the effect of magnetic field on various thermodynamic funtions such as free enrgy , entropy , internal energy , and specific heat of a charged oscillator . by this",
    "realistic calculations , one can make direct contact with experiment on low dimensional nanostructures and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "+ starting point of this paper is the famous caldeira - leggatt heat - bath model to incorporate the environmental effect in quantum and mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "this enables us to derive generalized quantum langevin equation ( gqle ) for the charged magneto - oscillator .",
    "then , we use the previously derived result of ford _ et al _",
    "@xcite for the free energy of a charged magneto - oscillator in an arbitrary heat bath in terms of a single integral involving generalized susceptibility coming up from the generalized quantum langevin equation @xcite .",
    "this enables us to derive the free energy of the model system at an arbitrary temperature . using this generalized result",
    ", one can obtain free energy expression and other thermodynamic functions of the charged quantum magneto - oscillator for three popular heat bath models : ohmic , single relaxation time and blackbody radiation heat bath or quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) model .",
    "+ now , we need to verify in which way our results are new from the previous results in literature .",
    "ford and oconnell discussed about the quantum thermodynamic functions for an oscillator coupled to a heat bath @xcite . in this paper , we extend the work of ford and oconnell to include the presence of an external static magnetic field .",
    "we determine various quantum thermodynamic functions of the charged magneto - oscillator coupled to a heat bath .",
    "what we find that each term in the low temperature expansion of different qtf are added up by two additional magnetic field dependent terms . on the other hand ,",
    "the inclusion of magnetic field in the problem is reflected in the two additional magnetic field dependent terms in each quantum thermodynamic function in the high temperature regime . in the low temperature regime",
    ", the magnetic field changes the qualitative behaviour as well as the quantitative values of different qtf for the charged magneto - oscillator from that of a free oscillator . in this low temperature regime ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath0 affect deacaying or rising behaviour of various qtf in the opposite manner .",
    "it is seen that the effect of @xmath1 is negligible in the high temperature regime .",
    "but , the effect of @xmath0 is still crucial at high temperatures .",
    "we also plot the general expression of various qtf for the entire temperature regime by numerically evaluating equation ( 24 ) .",
    "+ with this preceding background , we organize the rest of the paper as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe our model and the method of deriving free energy of the system .",
    "section iii is devoted to derive various thermodynamic functions ( such as entropy , internal energy , specific heat ) for the low temperature as well as high temperature regime for the ohmic heat bath . on the other hand , we derive qtf for the single relaxation time and blackbody radiation heat bath in section iv .",
    "zero temperature results are shown in section v. we conclude in section vi .",
    "the starting point of this section is the generalized caldeira - legget system - plus - reservoir hamiltonian for a charged particle of mass ` @xmath2 ' and charge ` @xmath3 ' in a magnetic field @xmath4 in the operator form @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the sets of co - ordinate and momentum operators of system and bath oscillators .",
    "they follow the following commutation relations @xmath8 where greek indices @xmath9 , @xmath10 stand for three spatial directions . eliminating the bath degrees of freedom by the heisenberg equations of motion one can obtain the generalized quantum langevin equation ( gqle ) @xcite : @xmath11 where dot denotes differentiation with respect to time @xmath12 . the effect of the magnetic field is solely represented by the quantum version of the lorentz force ( third term in eq .",
    "the memory kernel @xmath13 and the operator valued random force @xmath14 are unaffected by the magnetic field . in this work ,",
    "we consider the confining potential to be harmonic for which an exact analysis is possible .",
    "it is now possible to represent nonequal time anticommutator and commutator of @xmath14 as follows : @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the memory kernel is given by @xmath18 in equations ( 4)-(6 ) , @xmath19 denotes the spectral density function of the heat bath oscillators and is given by : @xmath20 we are interested in investigating thermodynamic behaviour of a dissipative charged magneto - oscillator at an arbitrary temperature .",
    "one can easily determine the free energy for this model system by using the remarkable formula @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the free energy of a single oscillator of frequency @xmath23 and is given by @xmath24 where we have ignored the zero - point contribution which is discussed in section v. here @xmath25 denotes the generalized susceptibility of the model system .",
    "since all the results presented in this paper rely on this remarkable formula , it is the cornerstone of the paper .",
    "so , we are giving a sketch of the way of deriving this notable formula .",
    "it is known that the free enrgy ascribed to the magneto - oscillator , f(t , b ) , is the free energy of the magneto - oscillator coupled to the heat bath minus the free energy of the bath in the absence of the magneto - oscillator . to derive this free energy one",
    "can follow the following method . using fourier",
    "transform one can rewrite equation ( 3 ) as follows : @xmath26 where , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the fourier transform of the operators @xmath29 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "now , it can be easily shown that @xmath25 have poles on the real axis at the normal mode frequencies , @xmath30 , of the interacting system and zeroes at the bath frequencies , @xmath31 , in the absence of the charged magneto oscillator .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath32 where the numerator is the product over normal modes of the free bath oscillators and the denominator is the product over those of the interacting system . from the well known formula @xmath33",
    ", one can show that : @xmath34 when this is put into equation ( 8) , it results : @xmath35 where , the first sum is clearly the free energy of the interacting system and second that of the free bath field .",
    "this demonstrates our assertion .",
    "now , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( 8) as follows @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the free energy of the oscillator in the absence of the magnetic field , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the scalar susceptibility in the absence of a magnetic field and the correction due to the magnetic field is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the scalar susceptibility for a harmonic oscillator in the absence of a magnetic field is given by @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 we have now all the essential ingredients to calculate thermodynamic functions . our main task is to find free energy @xmath44 .",
    "then , one can easily derive other thermodynamic functions at an arbitrary temperature .",
    "entropy is defined as @xmath45 internal energy is given by @xmath46 and specific heat is defined as @xmath47 now , we can proceed for the three popular heat - bath models of our interest which are characterized by the following spectral density functions ( a ) ohmic heat bath : @xmath48 , ( b ) single relaxation time : @xmath49 , and ( c ) blackbody radiation : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the ohmic friction constant , while @xmath52 is the relaxation time .",
    "usually @xmath52 is small i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is the high frequency cut - off characterizing electron form factor for blackbody radiation model .",
    "one can easily express @xmath39 for all the three cases by a single expression @xcite : @xmath55 following ford and oconnell , one can write @xmath56 ; @xmath57 ; @xmath58 for the single relaxation time model @xcite .",
    "the ohmic model can be represented by @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . on the other hand , for the blackbody radiation heat bath or qed model , @xmath62 ; @xmath63 ; @xmath64 , where @xmath2 is the bare mass and @xmath65 is the renormalized mass . in the largest value of cut - off limit @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .    with the general form of @xmath39 ( eq .",

    "free energy for the single relaxation time and qed model is given by @xmath121 as @xmath54 and @xmath122 are always large compared with @xmath123 , so retaining only the first term of the low temperature expansion of @xmath84 ; one can write @xmath124 for single relaxation time model , @xmath125 and @xmath126 . hence , the second term in eq .",

    "different qtf do not vary much for different values of @xmath1 ( see figure ( 11 ) and figure ( 12 ) ) .",

    "we also plot general result for different quantum thermodynamic functions for the entire temperature regime by using equation ( 24 ) which is expressed in terms of stieltjes j function ( see figure ( 17 ) and figure(18 ) ) . for the numerical computation , we use the lanczos formula for the stieltjes @xmath86 function @xcite : @xmath148 where @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",

    "recently jordan and b@xmath166ttiker discussed about the entanglement energetics of quantum system at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "so , following our method one can think of extending the study of entanglement enrgetics at finite temperature in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "also ratchov _",
    "et al _ discussed about decrease in coherence length of aharonov - bohm like interferrometer due to the interaction with a zero temperature environment .",
    "again , one can think of extending this work by following the method used in this paper for the finite temperature analysis @xcite .",
    "apart from that , one can think of another area in which thermodynamics plays a crucial role .",
    "following the previous research of several authors @xcite , one can think of developing microscopic theory for the entropy of black holes .",

    "<S> 0.5 cm explicit results for various quantum thermodynamic function ( qtf ) of a charged magneto - oscillator coupled to a heat bath at arbitrary temperature are demonstrated in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> discernible expressions for different qtf in the two limits of very low and very high temperatures are presented for three popular heat bath models : ohmic , single relaxation time and blackbody radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the central result is that the effect of magnetic field turns out to be important at low temperatures yet crucial at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the dissipation parameter , @xmath0 , and the cyclotron frequency , @xmath1 , affect the decaying or rising behaviour of various qtf in just the opposite way to each other at low temperatures . in the high temperature regime </S>",
    "<S> , the effect of @xmath0 is much pronounced than that of @xmath1 .    </S>",
