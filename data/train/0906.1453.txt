    "the ability to copy information is fundamental for many processes in distributing and dealing with data .",
    "while classical information can often be copied many times without any significant loss , the cloning of quantum information is seriously restricted by the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "this limitation is known today as the _ non - cloning _ theorem @xcite and has found its applications in quite different fields of quantum information theory , such as quantum computation @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite .    in processing quantum information , formally , any device that provides for @xmath2 _ unknown _ input states of a given system @xmath3 output states ( of the same or some analogue systems ) is called a @xmath4 quantum cloning machine ( qcm ) . to ensure a proper quantum behaviour ,",
    "such machines are usually represented as unitary transformations ; they are called _ symmetric _ if the @xmath5 output states are identical to each other , and are said to be _ nonsymmetric _ otherwise . in this work",
    ", we shall consider symmetric @xmath0 qcm that provides for a ( pure ) input state ( of qubit @xmath6 ) the two qubits @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the same output state @xmath8 , and where @xmath9 denotes the ( reduced ) density matrix of the corresponding qubit .",
    "for an ideal transformation , of course , we might expect @xmath10 i.e.  that the input and output states of qubit @xmath6 are the same , @xmath11 , but this would be in conflict with the non - cloning theorem mentioned above . in the transformation ( [ int-1 ] ) , as usual , we here suppose that the qubit @xmath7 was initially prepared in the state @xmath12 and that the state vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the initial and final states of the corresponding cloning device . in order to characterize the ` quality ' of a cloning device",
    ", we shall often use below the fidelity @xmath15 between the input and output state ( of qubit @xmath6 ) , which takes the values @xmath16 and where @xmath17 refers to the case that @xmath18 .",
    "several qcm s have been discussed in the literature before @xcite ; buek and hillery @xcite , for example , worked out a symmetric @xmath0 qcm that provides copies with the fidelity @xmath19 independent of the given input state .",
    "for some protocols in quantum cryptography , however , only few states @xmath20 are ( pre- ) selected from the bloch sphere and , hence , one may wish to find a state - dependent qcm that provides copies with higher fidelity than the universal buek - hillery machine for this particular set of states .",
    "the best - known example of such a state - dependent qcm is _ equatorial _ ( or phase - covariant ) qcm @xcite .",
    "this qcm provides copies with fidelity @xmath21 for all states which are taken from the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere .",
    "equatorial qcm has also found a remarkable application in quantum cryptography , since it can be used to improve the efficiency of an eavesdropping attack within the bb84 protocol @xcite .",
    "while , in fact , only four states ( from the equatorial plane ) are used in order to encode the information in the bb84 protocol , equatorial qcm enables an eavesdropper to obtain copies of these states with the highest fidelity , if compared with any other known qcm @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we here present and discuss another example of state - dependent qcm  a ( meridional ) qcm that provides copies with high - fidelity @xmath22 for all states along a given half - circle ( the ` eastern ' meridian ) of the bloch sphere , we also analyze how this newly suggested qcm can be applied in quantum cryptography for the eavesdropping within bennett s b92 quantum key distribution protocol @xcite .",
    "it is shown , in particular , that this transformation provides a substantial higher success rate than obtained for a universal or equatorial quantum copying .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "let us first introduce and discuss the general form of symmetric @xmath0 cloning transformations .",
    "in particular , here we shall analyze the buek - hillery - type transformations @xcite which can be utilized for both , a state - dependent and state - independent ( symmetric ) copying of quantum states . by making use of some additional parameter in the definition of the cloning transformation ( when compared to ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we then present a qcm in subsection  [ subsec:2.b ] which enables one to produce below , therefore , we will refer to this cloning transformation as a _",
    "qcm , even if the particular region of high - fidelity cloning can be chosen rather freely by adapting just three parameters in the given cloning transformation . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we later analyze for this new qcm the success ( or failure ) of an potential eavesdropper within bennett s b92 protocol @xcite for the distribution of quantum keys . in this section , emphasis is placed especially on the question how efficient such an eavesdropper can attack the transmission of quantum information ; in our discussion below , this will be quantified by means of the mutual information between the eavesdropper and the legitim user as well as the discrepancy of a qubit ( if compared with the originally transmitted one ) after a corresponding attack has been made .",
    "finally , a few conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "to introduce some notations that are necessary for our discussion below , let us start from a single qubit @xmath6 whose ( pure ) states can be written in the bloch sphere representation as @xmath23 , and with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the standard ( computational ) basis states . in this representation ,",
    "the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 take their values from @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and we shall often use this bloch sphere ( picture ) in order to visualize the states of interest .",
    "moreover , let us refer to the intersection of the bloch sphere with the _ x - z _ plane as the _ main circle _",
    ", so that all states from this intersection can be parameterized by means of just the ( single ) parameter @xmath26 as @xmath30 while , in this expression , the ` + ' sign refers to the right ( eastern ) meridian of the main circle and includes for @xmath31 also the diagonal state @xmath32 , the `  '",
    "sign is associated with its left ( western ) meridian and includes the state @xmath33 . for the sake of simplicity in visualizing the different states on the bloch sphere , we shall sometimes use also this ` geographical ' notation in our discussion below .",
    "although the state @xmath34 of a given qubit will be typically in a superposition of the two basis states @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "it is of course sufficient to know the transformation of just the basis in order to obtain a proper copying of states . therefore , the most general @xmath35 quantum cloning transformation for the state of qubit @xmath6 upon qubit @xmath7 can be cast into the form @xmath36",
    "\\ketm{1}_a \\ketm{0}_b \\ketm{q}_c   & \\longrightarrow &     \\sum_{m , n=0}^1 \\ , \\ketm{m}_a \\ketm{n}_b \\ketm{\\tilde{q}_{mn}}_c \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the initial state of the cloning apparatus , and where we have assumed  without loss of generality  that the second qubit @xmath7 was prepared initially in the basis state @xmath12 .",
    "once , the transformation has been performed , @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the output basis states of the two copies , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the corresponding states of the apparatus . as seen from the transformation ( [ general - qct ] ) , here we do not assume any additional condition for the final states of the cloning apparatus .",
    "however , in order to ensure that the transformation ( [ general - qct ] ) is _ unitary _ , @xmath41 for all possible input states , i.e.  for @xmath42 @xmath43 , the final states of the apparatus must fulfill certain requirements @xcite .    in eq .",
    "( [ unitary - cloning ] ) , the three - partite basis @xmath44 refers to a complete and orthonormal basis for the overall system ` qubits a , b + apparatus ' .",
    "thus , the requested unitarity @xmath45 of the transformation ( [ general - qct ] ) implies the conditions @xmath46 for any explicit construction of a @xmath35 quantum cloning transformation , we must therefore ` determine ' the final states @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the apparatus in line with the conditions ( [ general - cond ] ) .",
    "these state vectors then define the qcm uniquely .",
    "before we shall construct qcm with some particular properties , let us consider the simplest case of such a transformation ( [ general - qct ] ) as first suggested by wootters and zurek @xcite @xmath47     \\ketm{1}_a \\ketm{0}_b \\ketm{q}_c   & \\longrightarrow &     \\ketm{1}_a \\ketm{1}_b \\ketm{\\tilde{q}_{11}}_c \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this transformation , obviously , only a single term is retained from the summations on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eqs .",
    "( [ general - qct ] ) , i.e.  the term with @xmath48 in the first and @xmath49 in the second line .",
    "no further freedom remains in the set - up of this transformation since the unitarity conditions ( [ general - cond ] ) then require @xmath50 . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ wootters / zurek - qct ] ) , moreover , the wootters - zurek transformation is symmetric with regard to an interchange of the basis states @xmath51 and this implies that the same symmetry helds also for the state of the two copies @xmath52 and @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 . for the wootters - zurek transformation ,",
    "furthermore , the fidelity between the input state ( from the main cirlce ) and the corresponding output is given by @xmath55 therefore , this particular transformation can provide an ` exact ' copy with fidelity @xmath56 just for the basis states and , i.e.  the two ` poles ' of the bloch sphere , while the fidelity drops down to @xmath57 for all states along the equator and , especially , for the two diagonal states .",
    "for this reason , the wootters - zurek transformation appears to be of little help if one wishes to copy ( unknown ) states other than the basis states themselves .",
    "additional terms in the cloning transformation ( [ general - qct ] ) need to be considered if we wish to construct a qcm that supports an equal - fidelity cloning for all states on the bloch sphere , or which improves the fidelity between the input and output states for certain regions on this sphere .",
    "for example , buek and hillery @xcite have analyzed in quite detail the three - term transformation @xmath58     & & \\hspace*{-0.05 cm } \\:+\\ :     \\left [ \\ketm{0}_a \\ketm{1}_b   + \\ketm{1}_a \\ketm{0}_b     \\right ] \\ , \\ketm{y_0}_c \\ , , \\\\[0.2 cm ]     \\ketm{1}_a \\ketm{0}_b \\ketm{q}_c     & \\longrightarrow &   \\ketm{1}_a \\ketm{1}_b \\ketm{q_1}_c \\nonumber\\\\[0.1 cm ] \\label{buzek / hillery - qct-2 }     & & \\hspace*{-0.05 cm } \\:+\\ :     \\left [ \\ketm{0}_a \\ketm{1}_b + \\ketm{1}_a \\ketm{0}_b     \\right ] \\ , \\ketm{y_1}_c , \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which takes into account two additional terms ( compared with the wootters - zurek transformation ( [ wootters / zurek - qct ] ) ) and which gives us further freedom in choosing the final states of the cloning apparatus .",
    "to follow the notation by buek and hillery @xcite , here we have introduced @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 to denote the final states of the apparatus .",
    "again , in order to ensure the symmetry with regard to an interchange @xmath63 of the basis states of qubit @xmath6 , we have assumed conditions @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the final states of the cloning apparatus .",
    "( [ buzek / hillery - qct-1])-([buzek / hillery - qct-2 ] ) can be utilized to define cloning transformations for which the fidelity between the input and output states is either state - independent or depends explicity on the given input .",
    "this behaviour depends on the additional restriction we shall place on the final states of the apparatus , beside of the unitarity conditions ( [ unitary - cloning ] ) . for the sake of simplicity , let us omit in the following the indices @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the individual subsystems but keep in mind that @xmath68 always refers to the state of the two copies to be created , and that the vectors and belong to the cloning apparatus . with this change in the notation , we find from eqs .",
    "( [ general - cond ] ) that the final - state vectors of the apparatus in the buek - hillery transformation must satisfy the conditions @xmath69 \\label{unit - con-3 }     \\sprm{y_0}{y_1 } & = & 0 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to ensure the unitarity of the transformation . for a general ( pure ) input state ( [ main - meridian ] ) from the main circle ,",
    "the qcm ( [ buzek / hillery - qct-1])-([buzek / hillery - qct-2 ] ) then gives rise to the two - qubit density operator @xmath70 which contain 14 scalar products between the final - state vectors from the apparatus .",
    "each scalar product introduces a ( complex ) parameter for the buek - hillery transformation ( [ buzek / hillery - qct-1])-([buzek / hillery - qct-2 ] ) .",
    "this gives rise to a total of 14 parameters for the quantum cloning transformation ( [ buzek / hillery - qct-1])-([buzek / hillery - qct-2 ] ) , while only the 3 restrictions ( [ unit - con-12])-([unit - con-3 ] ) need to be fulfilled due to the unitarity of the transformation .",
    "further conditions must therefore be formulated in order to define the qcm properly .",
    "for example , we may choose all scalar products to be real and also request that the two final - state vectors and have an equal norm @xmath71 under these conditions , eq .",
    "( [ unit - con-12 ] ) takes the same form for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and hence , @xmath74 .",
    "there are two other conditions that can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ unit - con-12])-([unit - con-3 ] ) by using the restriction ( [ notations-1 ] ) , namely , @xmath75 \\label{notations-3 }     \\sprm{q_1}{y_1 } & = & \\sprm{q_0}{y_0 } \\;\\equiv\\ ; \\kappa/2 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with these additional notations and conditions , we have arrived at the final - state density matrix @xmath70 of the transformation ( [ buzek / hillery - qct-1])-([buzek / hillery - qct-2 ] ) that now depends only on three real parameters .",
    "this is quite in contrast to the original work of buek and hillery @xcite who assumed the final states of the apparatus @xmath76 to be pairwise orthogonal to each other for the cloning of the two basis states @xmath77 .",
    "while the condition ( [ notations-3 ] ) introduces a nonorthogonality between the final states of the apparatus , three parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 enables us to provide high - fidelity copies for a region of input states from the bloch sphere .",
    "however , the three parameters @xmath80 and @xmath79 are not completely independent of each other but must fulfill the three inequalities @xmath81      0 & \\leq & \\eta    \\:\\leq\\ : 2\\sqrt{\\zeta(1 - 2\\zeta ) } \\ , , \\label{schwarz - con-3}\\\\[0.01 cm ]      0 & \\leq & \\kappa \\:\\leq\\ : 2\\sqrt{\\zeta(1 - 2\\zeta ) } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to schwarz inequality for the state vectors of the cloning apparatus .",
    "using the final - state density matrix @xmath70 for the transformation ( [ buzek / hillery - qct-1])-([buzek / hillery - qct-2 ] ) , it is simple to show that the reduced density operator @xmath82 is the same for both subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 , that is @xmath83 . we can utilize this expression ( [ reduced - den - matrix ] ) to calculate also the fidelity between the input and output for all states @xmath84 along the main circle @xmath85 although the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath79 are restricted by the inequalities ( [ schwarz - con-1])-([schwarz - con-3 ] ) , it is this _ freedom _ in choosing these parameters that enables us to optimize the fidelity @xmath86 for certain ( regions of ) states . since @xmath79 has a different sign for the two parts of the main circle , a nonzero value this parameter leads to a quite different behavior of the fidelity along the western and eastern meridian : the high fidelity along the eastern meridian correspond to positive parameter @xmath79 , while the high fidelity along the western meridian is achieved for negative @xmath79 .",
    "so , for proper values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 we can obtain a high fidelity for one meridian .",

    "although an eavesdropping of the ( quantum ) communication between two partners , say alice and bob , might be seriously hampered by the well - known impossibility to produce exact clones of quantum information ( non - cloning theorem ) , the generation of high - fidelity copies may enlarge the success rate for such an attack .",
    "it is therefore worth to know for both , the two partners who wish to communicate as well as for a potential eavesdropper , how much our suggested ( meridional ) qcm ( [ suggested - qcm-1])-([suggested - qcm-2 ] ) will affect quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols . in this section , we shall therefore analyze with which success ( or failure ) an potential eavesdropper , say eve , may attack bennett s b92 protocol @xcite .    in the b92 protocol ,",
    "only two nonorthogonal quantum states are utilized in order to encode and transmit the information about the cryptographic key . as usual",

    "can be used to construct the key , while all the rest need to be discarded because no definite conclusion can be drawn from the outcome of bob s measurement . to test and recognize a ( possible ) eavesdropper ,",
    "alice and bob compare moreover the values of some of their bits via the public channel in order to get an estimate how likely their communication was disturbed .    in practice , a disturbance in the transmission of a ( secret ) key can have very different reasons . apart from an eavesdropper ,",
    "the quantum control during the preparation or transmission of the qubits might be incomplete for a given realization of the quantum channel .",
    "for all practical realizations of qkd protocols , therefore , a certain error rate ( disturbance ) need to be accepted , and an eavesdropper might be successful in extracting information even if the protocol is inherently secure in the ideal case . to quantify the disturbance in the transmission of a single qubit , a convenient measure is the probability that alice and bob detect an error . if bob would know the state of one or several qubits in advance , that were sent to him by alice",
    ", he could easily test for a possible eavesdropping attack . in this case",
    ", he will receive in general the qubits no longer in a pure but a mixed state that has to be described in terms of its density matrix @xmath91 .",
    "the _ discrepancy _ that is detected by bob is given by @xmath92 since bob knows the maximal discrepancy @xmath93 for the given channel ( due to the incomplete quantum control of the given transmission ) , he could recognize an eavesdropping attack for @xmath94 and discard the key accordingly .",
    "a central question for eve is of how much information she can extract from the transmission of the key if the disturbance due to his attack should be @xmath95 . from the initial agreement between alice and",
    "bob about the basis states which are to be chosen randomly , eve might know that alice prepares the qubits in one of the two states ( [ b92_states ] ) with probability @xmath96 .",
    "before eve has measured a given qubit , her ( degree of ) ignorance is given by shannon s entropy @xmath97 .",
    "after the measurement , she increased her knowledge about the system by decreasing this entropy , a measure that is called the mutual information that eve has acquired due to the measurement .",
    "obviously , eve will try to obtain as much information as possible keeping the discrepancy @xmath95 .    in order to discuss",
    "how much eve will affect the transmission ( and thus increase her knowledge about the transmitted information ) , we must specify the circumstances under which the eavesdropping attack is made .",
    "as output of her cloning transformation , she then obtains two copies of one of the two possible states with a fidelity as defined by the given qcm .",
    "while eve transmits one of her copies further to bob , she could measure the second copy following the same procedure as bob .    to calculate the mutual information between alice and eve that is to be extracted from the eavesdropping",
    ", we can follow the procedure as described in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . using the povm elements ( [ povm-1])-([povm-3 ] ) , the probability for eve to obtain the outcome @xmath98 is @xmath99 and where the operators @xmath100 refer to the two possible states @xmath101 of her copy . after the measurement ,",
    "when she has obtained a particular outcome @xmath98 , the _ posterior _ probability @xmath102 that @xmath100 was prepared by alice is @xmath103 where @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the probability for sending the states and within the b92 protocol . with these probabilities , the shannon entropy (",
