    "as we initiate the era of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , we await with anticipation the expected discovery of supersymmetry and the higgs states required to break electroweak symmetry and stabilize the electroweak scale . on the other hand",
    ", there is thus far no concrete model that can explain all observed physics in a comprehensive mathematical framework .",
    "unique predictions that can be tested at the lhc , future international linear collider ( ilc ) , and other forthcoming experiments are necessary if string theory is to be substantiated as the correct fundamental description of nature . following a top - down approach , it may be feasible to derive all known observable physics from a fundamental theory such as string theory .",
    "in contrast , the bottom - up approach offers the possibility to infer the framework of the fundamental theory at high - energy from a low - energy signal at the experiments . in the spirit of this bottom - up approach ,",
    "our goal here is to study grand unified theories ( guts ) from f - theory , which have seen exciting progress the past two years , and present f - theory gut low - energy physics observable at current and future experiments .",
    "f - theory can be considered as the strongly coupled formulation of ten - dimensional type iib string theory with a varying axion ( @xmath2)-dilaton ( @xmath3 ) field @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "guts were first locally constructed in f - theory two years ago  @xcite , and subsequently , model building and phenomenological consequences have been studied extensively  @xcite . in f - theory model building , the gauge fields are on the observable seven - branes that wrap a del pezzo @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) surface for the extra four space dimensions , the sm fermions and higgs fields are localized on the complex codimension - one curves ( two - dimensional real subspaces ) in @xmath6 , and the standard model ( sm ) fermion yukawa couplings arise from the triple intersections of the sm fermion and higgs curves .",
    "a brand new feature is that the @xmath1 gauge symmetry can be broken down to the sm gauge symmetry by turning on the @xmath7 flux  @xcite , and the @xmath8 gauge symmetry can be broken down to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 gauge symmetries by turning on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 fluxes , respectively  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the @xmath8 models have both gauge interaction unification and sm fermion unification , and consequently we believe the @xmath8 models are more interesting to study than the @xmath1 models .",
    "moreover , we can break the @xmath8 gauge symmetry down to the flipped @xmath9 gauge symmetry by turning on the @xmath11 flux , wherein the doublet - triplet splitting problem can be solved elegantly  @xcite .",
    "the flipped @xmath9 models with tev scale vector - like particles  @xcite , which have been dubbed `` @xmath0-@xmath1 '' , have been constructed systematically in f - theory  @xcite .",
    "models of this nature can be also obtained in the free fermionic string constructions  @xcite . in @xmath0-@xmath1 ,",
    "the @xmath13 gauge symmetries are unified at about @xmath14 gev , and the @xmath9 gauge symmetries are unified above @xmath15 gev .",
    "thus , we can solve the monopole problem .",
    "on top of this , the tev scale vector - like particles are potentially observable at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass can be lifted  @xcite , and the predicted proton decay  @xcite is within the reach of the future hyper - kamiokande  @xcite and deep underground science and engineering laboratory ( dusel )  @xcite experiments .",
    "recently , the cryogenic dark matter search ( cdms ) collaboration observed two candidate dark matter events in the cdms ii experiment  @xcite .",
    "the recoil energies for these two events were 12.3 kev and 15.5 kev , respectively , and the data set an upper limit on the dark matter - nucleon elastic - scattering spin independent cross section around @xmath16 pb .",
    "the probability of observing two or more background events is @xmath17 , so the cdms ii results can not be considered statistically significant evidence for dark matter interactions , although there is some strong possibility that they do in fact represent an authentic signal .",
    "in particular , the favored dark matter mass from the cdms ii data is about 100 gev .",
    "interestingly , the cdms ii experiment can be explained in the supersymmetric standard model with @xmath18 parity where the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) neutralino is the dark matter candidate  @xcite .    in this paper , we first briefly review @xmath0-@xmath1 , and then subsequently study the supersymmetry breaking soft terms in the framework of gravity mediation .",
    "although the gaugino masses are not unified at the traditional gut scale , we still have the same gaugino mass relation at the electroweak scale as the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) scenario at one loop  @xcite .",
    "we also introduce two parameters testable at the colliders to measure the small two - loop deviations from the msugra gaugino mass relations at the electroweak scale .",
    "next , we incorporate tev scale vector particles and generate regions of the parameter space that can satisfy all current experimental constraints and are consistent with the cdms ii experiment  @xcite . in addition , we compute the annihilation cross - section of two neutralinos into two gamma - rays and evaluate the results in light of the first published fermi - lat measurement .",
    "then we compute the new parameters to measure the two - loop deviations for both @xmath0-@xmath1 and msugra .",
    "we find that the deviations from the msugra gaugino mass relation in msugra are smaller than 5% , while the deviations in the @xmath0-@xmath1 are larger as a result of the tev scale vector - like particles .",
    "an analytical comparison of the deviation between msugra and @xmath0-@xmath1 is illustrated .",
    "next , the expected observable final states at the lhc are given for all viable regions of the parameter space .",
    "lastly , the proton lifetime is calculated for the experimentally allowed regions of the @xmath0-@xmath1 parameter space , and we show that the rate of predicted decay is indeed within the reach of the future hyper - kamiokande and dusel experiments .",
    "first , we briefly review the minimal flipped @xmath9 model  @xcite .",

    "we study a recent analysis of the msugra parameter space in  @xcite . upon closer examination of the two models",
    ", we see that it appears the vector - like particles and partial gaugino mass universality are shifting the upper narrow wmap strip to a larger gaugino mass and smaller @xmath107 .",
    "the essential aspect is that the gaugino mass rge running is changed significantly due to the additional vector - like particles .",
    "the consequences of this include a heavier lsp for large @xmath107 when compared to msugra , with the lsp mass increasing to a limited range centered around 100 gev .",
    "recall , our benchmark point from the wmap strip at large @xmath107 is @xmath128 = 107 gev . in contrast , the lsp mass in the experimentally allowed region of msugra for large @xmath107 and small @xmath148 is well below 100 gev .",
    "moreover , the experimentally allowed region of a larger gaugino mass and smaller @xmath107 gets shifted to a heavier gaugino mass . in these regions of small @xmath107 ,",
    "as already noted , the wmap relic density is generated through stau - neutralino coannihilation .",
    "however , as we described , in @xmath0-@xmath1 this region of large @xmath78 and small @xmath107 possesses wimp - nucleon cross - sections well below the cdms ii upper limit .",
    "it is interesting to consider what we could see at the lhc for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model framework .",
    "we calculate the differential cross - sections and branching ratios with pythia 6.411  @xcite , using the revised suspect 2.34 code that includes the effects of the vector - like particle contributions to compute the sparticle masses for input into pythia 6.411 .",
    "the three lightest sparticles for the @xmath113 table  [ tab : masses1 ] benchmark point are @xmath149 .",
    "the production of gluinos @xmath150 and squarks @xmath151 have the largest differential cross - sections at the lhc .",
    "the @xmath151 decays to a gluino and hadronic jet due to the noticeably lighter mass of the gluino in comparison to the squarks , while the @xmath150 will produce a neutralino or chargino along with a hadronic jet .",

    "we will get @xmath155 quarks from the remainder of the @xmath152 through light higgs in the process @xmath156 with a branching ratio of 36% .",
    "these light higgs will in turn decay to @xmath157 with a 75% branching ratio .",
    "leptons and hadronic jets will result from the decay @xmath158 , where this is the only kinematically allowed @xmath159 process .",
    "thus , this benchmark point will produce mainly @xmath160 and @xmath161 bosons , and some @xmath155 quarks through light higgs @xmath162 at lhc .",
    "additionally , the vector - like particles can couple to sm fermions and higgs fields via yukawa interactions , and they can then decay to sm fermions and higgs fields , as well as the lsp neutralino .",
    "we see quite different lhc states for the benchmark point in table  [ tab : masses2 ] .",
    "this point resides in the region of the experimentally allowed parameter space that generates the wmap relic density through stau - neutralino coannihilation .",
    "hence , the four lightest sparticles for this benchmark point are @xmath163 . here , as in the benchmark point in table  [ tab : masses1 ] , the gluino is lighter than the squarks , so all squarks will predominantly decay to a gluino and hadronic jet , with a small percentage of squarks producing a neutralino or chargino , plus a jet , and the gluinos will then decay to neutralinos or charginos as well .",
    "the result is low - energy tau through the processes @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "the lhc final states of low - energy tau in the @xmath0-@xmath1 stau - neutralino coannihilation region are similar to those same low - energy lhc final states in msugra , however , in the stau - neutralino coannihilation region of msugra , the gluino is typically heavier than the squarks .",
    "again , the strong coupling effects from the additional vector - like particles on the gaugino mass rge running reduce the physical gluino mass below the squark masses in @xmath0-@xmath1 . as a consequence",
    ", the lhc final low - energy tau states in the stau - neutralino coannihilation regions of @xmath0-@xmath1 and msugra will differ in that in @xmath0-@xmath1 , the low - energy tau states will result largely from neutralinos and charginos produced by gluinos , as opposed to the low - energy tau states in msugra resulting primarily from neutralinos and charginos produced from squarks .",
    "the first year lhc run in 2011 at 7 tev and anticipated luminosity of 1 - 2 @xmath166 is expected to reach gluino production possibly up to 1 tev , which makes the light gluino in our study here tantalizing for discovery in the early lhc run .",
    "however , for our tan@xmath112 = 51 benchmark study in this work , the heavy squarks are most likely too heavy for production in this early lhc phase .",
    "nonetheless , a closer examination of smaller values of tan@xmath112 shows correspondingly lighter spectra , indicating that signals for tan@xmath167 are within the first year lhc discovery reach .",
    "additionally , in contrast to our tan@xmath112 = 51 points studied here where the gluino is lighter than all the squarks , for tan@xmath168 spectra , the lightest stop is the lone squark lighter than the gluino , providing the potential for a very unique signal .",
    "this same @xmath169 mass pattern has also been uncovered in follow - up studies where this model has been extended to include the @xmath9 unification  @xcite .",
    "we shall study this signal much more in - depth in our future work .",
    "instability of the proton is an essential signature of guts , the merger of the sm forces necessarily linking quarks to leptons , and providing a narrow channel @xmath121 of dimension six decay via heavy gauge boson exchange .",
    "we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the proton decay rate for the available parameter space of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model of the current report , employing the methods established in refs .",
    "@xcite and the further citations therein .",
    "the 50-kiloton ( kt ) water erenkov detector of the super - kamiokande facility has set lower bounds of @xmath170 and @xmath171 years at the @xmath172 confidence level for the partial lifetimes in the @xmath173 and @xmath174 modes  @xcite .",
    "hyper - kamiokande is a proposed 1-megaton detector , about 20 times larger volumetrically than super - k  @xcite , which we can expect to explore partial lifetimes up to a level near @xmath175 years for @xmath121 across a decade long run .",
    "the proposal for the dusel experiment  @xcite features both water erenkov and liquid argon ( which is around five times more sensitive per kilogram to @xmath176 than water ) detectors , in the neighborhood of 500 and 100 kt respectively , with the stated goal of probing partial lifetimes into the order of @xmath122 years for both the neutral pion and @xmath177 channels . flipped @xmath1 evades the dangerously rapid @xmath178 dimension five triplet higgsino mediated decay by way of the missing - partner mechanism  @xcite , which realizes higgs doublet - triplet splitting naturally , without the side effect of strong triplet mixing .",
    "proton lifetime in the @xmath121 dimension six mode is proportional in the fourth power to the gut mass scale , and inversely proportional in the fourth power to the gut coupling .",
    "this extreme sensitivity argues for great care in the selection and study of a unification scenario .",
    "the f - theory derived gut models which feature additional vector - like multiplets at the tev scale modify the renormalization group to yield a substantial increase in the @xmath13 unified coupling , which translates in turn into something like a seven - fold enhancement of the proton decay rate .",
    "moreover , inclusion of tev scale vector multiplets in the renormalization significantly magnifies the separation of the flipped scale @xmath40 , at which @xmath1 breaks and proton decay is established , from the point @xmath179 of true grand unification , which can be extended to the order of the reduced planck mass .    in our calculations ,",
    "we take the sparticle and higgs spectrum generated by suspect 2.34 , modified for flipped @xmath180 unification , as input for the light threshold corrections .",
    "these are applied individually to each of the three gauge couplings , taking into account the distinct quantum numbers of each field .",
    "the second loop contribution is likewise individually numerically determined for each gauge coupling , including the top and bottom quark yukawa couplings from the third generation , taken themselves in the first loop .",
    "all three gauge couplings are integrated recursively with the second loop into the yukawa coupling renormalization , with the boundary conditions at @xmath181 set by the value of @xmath182 .",
    "we take this value , reduced modestly from that of @xmath183 employed elsewhere in this report , to avoid pathologies in convergence of the renormalization .",
    "we emphasize that this slightly modified value of tan@xmath112 = 44 is employed only for the proton lifetime calculations , whereas the value of tan@xmath112 = 51 is used in all other calculations for the benchmark points . finally , recognizing that the second loop itself influences the upper limit @xmath40 of its own integrated contribution",
    ", this feedback is accounted for in the dynamic calculation of the unification scale .",
    "the benchmark spectra of the selected points featured in tables  [ tab : masses1 ] and  [ tab : masses2 ] yield central lifetimes of @xmath184 and @xmath185 years , respectively .",
    "in addition to the light @xmath186-scale threshold corrections from the superpartner s entry into the rges , there may also be shifts occurring near the @xmath187 unification point due to heavy higgs fields and the broken gauge generators of @xmath1 .",
    "the light fields carry strong correlations to cosmology and low energy phenomenology , as is indeed the central theme of this work , so that we are guided toward plausible estimates of their mass distribution .",
    "the heavy thresholds are somewhat more difficult to pin down , although we may conclusively suggest that they act only to lengthen , rather than reduce , the dimension six proton lifetime  @xcite .    including uncertainties for parameter input and light and heavy thresholds , we conclude that the central values for proton decay , and also a large fraction of the plausible variation , are indeed within the reach of proposed next - generation experiments such as hyper - kamiokande and dusel .",
    "additionally , detectability of tev scale vector supermultiplets at the lhc presents an opportunity for cross correlation of results between the most exciting particle physics experiments of the coming decade .",
    "we emphasize that the cumulative effect of flipped @xmath1 grand unification in the f - theory model building context , applying the freshly detailed methods of analysis recently described , and focusing on the phenomenologically preferred parameter space , is surprisingly fast proton decay .",
    "we have considered gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking in @xmath0-@xmath1 . the gaugino masses are not unified at the traditional grand unification scale , though we do indeed obtain the msugra one - loop gaugino mass relation at the electroweak scale .",
    "however , the gaugino mass relation will have a small two - loop deviation , and this deviation may be measurable at the lhc and ilc . there is a considerable need for tev scale vector - like particles in @xmath0-@xmath1 , while unflipped guts , such as msugra or f-@xmath1 , require no such vector - like particles . in light of this key distinction between flipped and unflipped guts",
    ", we introduced a parameter to measure the small two - loop deviation from the msugra gaugino mass relation at the electroweak scale .    to implement a numerical analysis , we modified a popular and well - established public rge code to incorporate the effects of tev scale vector - like particles . in this work , we employed two - loop rges for the gauge couplings , but only considered one - loop rges for the yukawa couplings and soft - supersymmetry breaking terms , though we look to extend this to all two - loop supersymmetry breaking rges in our future work .",
    "the results lead us to conclude there is a clear disparity in the extent of the deviation between guts with vector - like particles , such as @xmath0-@xmath1 , and guts without vector - like particles , such as msugra or f-@xmath1 . the predicted correlation between largeness of the deviation from the msugra gaugino mass relation and the existence of vector - like particles",
    "can be tested at the colliders .",
    "furthermore , we have determined the viable parameter space of this model which simultaneously satisfies all the current experimental constraints and is consistent with the findings of cdms ii .",
    "the cross - section of two neutralinos into two gamma - rays for the experimentally allowed regions of the parameter space was computed and assessed against the first published fermi - lat measurement .",
    "the results showed the @xmath0-@xmath1 parameter space is consistent with the recent fermi - lat findings .",
    "finally , we have calculated the proton lifetime for these experimentally allowed regions , and found it to be within the reach of the future hyper - kamiokande and dusel experiments .",
    "a wealth of experimental data is on the horizon , so it is imperative that phenomenologically appealing guts , for instance @xmath0-@xmath1 , be researched so that unambiguous experimental predictions may be presented .",
    "these predictions will be key milestones in deducing the underlying theory at high energies as we progress through the next few exciting years of lhc , direct dark matter detection , fermi - lat , and proton decay experiments .",
    "we have supplemented the conventional bottom - up analysis of traditional guts to include tev scale vector - like particles , and our results feature encouraging prospects for the experimental determination of whether high - energy theory indeed admits these proposed multiplets .",

    "<S> we study gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking in @xmath0-@xmath1 and its low - energy supersymmetric phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> the gaugino masses are not unified at the traditional grand unification scale , but we nonetheless have the same one - loop gaugino mass relation at the electroweak scale as minimal supergravity ( msugra ) . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce parameters testable at the colliders to measure the small second loop deviation from the msugra gaugino mass relation at the electroweak scale . in the minimal @xmath1 model with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking , we show that the deviations from the msugra gaugino mass relations are within 5% . </S>",
    "<S> however , in @xmath0-@xmath1 , we predict the deviations from the msugra gaugino mass relations to be larger due to the presence of vector - like particles , which can be tested at the colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the viable parameter space that satisfies all the latest experimental constraints and find it is consistent with the cdms ii experiment . </S>",
    "<S> further , we compute the cross - sections of neutralino annihilations into gamma - rays and compare to the first published fermi - lat measurement . finally , the corresponding range of proton lifetime predictions is calculated and found to be within reach of the future hyper - kamiokande and dusel experiments . </S>"
