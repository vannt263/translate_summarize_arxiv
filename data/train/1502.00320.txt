    "in fact , the convergence in ( [ grenanderlimitdistributionatfixedpoint ] ) can be extended to weak convergence of the ( local ) grenander process as follows .",

    "@xcite gives a complete analytic characterization of the limiting distribution @xmath27 and further , the distributional structure of the process @xmath28 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath29 has been studied numerically by @xcite which relies heavily on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the distribution of @xmath27 is log - concave .",
    "note that there is an `` invariance principle '' involved here : the centered slope of the least concave majorant of @xmath13 converges weakly to a constant times the slope of the least concave majorant of @xmath30 .",
    "we can regard the slope in this gaussian limit problem , @xmath31 , as an `` estimator '' of the slope of the line @xmath32 in the gaussian problem of `` estimating '' the `` canonical '' linear function @xmath32 in `` gaussian white noise '' @xmath33 since @xmath34",
    "our main goal is to prove the following law of the iterated logarithm ( lil ) for the grenander estimator corresponding to the limiting distribution result in ( [ grenanderlimitdistributionatfixedpoint ] ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 , @xmath36 with @xmath37 continuous in a neighborhood of @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath38 almost surely where @xmath39 here @xmath6 is the two - sided strassen limit set on @xmath7 given by @xmath40    our proof of theorem 1 will rely on functional laws of the iterated logarithm for the local empirical process established by @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . along the way we will also prove several lemmas concerning the limit set @xmath6 .",
    "we begin the proof of theorem 1 with a switching argument .",
    "let @xmath41 .",
    "then we want to find a number @xmath42 such that @xmath43 now we let @xmath44 and note that @xmath45 by groeneboom s switching relation ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite page 296 , and @xcite , theorem 2.1 , page 881 ) .",
    "thus the event in the last display can be rewritten as @xmath46 but , by letting @xmath47 in ( [ switchingrelation ] ) we see that @xmath48 and hence the right side of ( [ switchrelationforlil ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath49 where @xmath50 the second term on the right side in the last display converges to @xmath51 as @xmath52 .",
    "the handle the first term we appeal to ( a slight extension of ) theorem 2 of @xcite ; see also @xcite theorem a and theorem 1.1 , pages 1620 - 1621 : by considering @xmath53 and introducing the two - sided version @xmath6 of the strassen limit set given in ( [ twosidestrassensetonr ] ) much as in @xcite , we see that the sequence of functions @xmath54 is almost surely relatively compact with limit set @xmath55 where @xmath6 is given by .    this is most easily seen as follows : let @xmath56 be the empirical d.f . of @xmath57 i.i.d .",
    "uniform@xmath58 . as in @xcite , with @xmath59 so that @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the processes @xmath62 with @xmath63 are almost surely relatively compact with limit set @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "here we also note that @xmath66 thus the processes involved in the argmax in are almost surely relatively compact with limit set @xmath67 and by lemma 1 below this set is equal to @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "thus by lemma 2 below , the set of limits for the argmax in equals @xmath71 where @xmath72 hence , with @xmath73 , @xmath74 if @xmath75 it remains only to show that @xmath76 .",
    "this follows from lemma 3 in section 4 below .",
    "let @xmath77 and @xmath78 . then @xmath79    if @xmath80 , then @xmath81 where @xmath82 since @xmath83",
    "this shows that the set of functions @xmath84 , @xmath80 , is contained in @xmath85 . on the other hand , any function @xmath82 with derivative @xmath86",
    "may be written as @xmath87 with @xmath88 given by @xmath89 and satisfying @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath91 be positive constants and @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath93    note first that @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath77 and @xmath96 we may write @xmath97 in case of @xmath98 we obtain @xmath99 now the claim follows from lemma  1 , because the set @xmath100 equals @xmath6 .",
    "as noted in the introduction , @xmath101 this suggests that with @xmath102 we have @xmath103",
    "it is natural to conjecture that @xmath104 .",
    "this is motivated by the asymptotic behavior of chernoff s density ; see @xcite , corollary 3.4 , page 94 : since the density @xmath105 as @xmath106 , the tail probability @xmath107 satisfies @xmath108 as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the largest zero of the airy function @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "thus from ( [ grenanderlimitdistributionatfixedpoint ] ) we expect that @xmath113 or , equivalently , @xmath114 on the other hand the proof of theorem 1 above leads to @xmath115 where @xmath116 thus we conjecture that @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath118 be an arbitrary positive number and let @xmath119)$ ] be an arbitrary function satisfying @xmath120 then @xmath121    let @xmath122 .",
    "the claimed inequality is trivial if the integral on the left side is infinite , so we may view @xmath88 and @xmath123 as elements of the hilbert space @xmath124)$ ] .",

    "this is the set of non - negative and non - decreasing functions on @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath131 , so @xmath132 together with the cauchy - schwarz inequality we obtain @xmath133 so @xmath134 .",
    "this inequality is strict unless @xmath135 for some @xmath136 . in this special case",
    "the last display reads @xmath137 , so @xmath138 and @xmath139 with equality if , and only if , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "if we take @xmath142 and @xmath143 , then @xmath144 so the limit superior is just @xmath145 .    if we take @xmath146 , then @xmath147 and hence with @xmath148 we have @xmath149 .",
    "then @xmath150 so the limit superior is @xmath151 .",
    "if we take @xmath152 } ( x)$ ] and @xmath153 , then @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 so the limit superior is @xmath157 .",
    "theorem  1 has a number of corollaries and consequences , since the argument in the proof applies to a number of problems involving nonparametric estimation of a monotone function .",
    "our first corollary , however , involves estimation of the mixing distribution @xmath158 in the mixture representation of a monotone density : that is , @xmath159 for some distribution function @xmath158 on @xmath160 .",
    "this fact apparently goes back at least to @xcite ; see the introduction of @xcite , and @xcite , page 158 .",
    "the relationship ( [ mixrepresa - monotone ] ) implies that the corresponding distribution function @xmath9 is given by @xmath161 and this can be `` inverted '' to yield @xmath162 from figure  [ fig : figure3 ] we see that the function on the right side of ( [ inverseofamonotone ] ) is non - negative and non - decreasing : the shaded area gives exactly the difference @xmath163 .",
    "the identity ( [ inverseofamonotone ] ) implies that the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath158 is @xmath164 given by @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the least concave majorant of @xmath13 and the mle of @xmath9 assuming that @xmath11 is monotone ( and hence @xmath9 is concave ) .",
    "thus for @xmath118 we can write @xmath167 from marshall s lemma @xcite and @xmath168 it follows that @xmath169 .",
    "thus if @xmath170 is a point at which the hypotheses of theorem 1 hold , then the convergence in ( [ grenanderlimitdistributionatfixedpoint ] ) implies that @xmath171 similarly , from marshall s lemma @xcite and chung s law of the iterated logarithm for @xmath172 ( see e.g. @xcite , page 505 ) , we know that with @xmath173 @xmath174 it follows that if @xmath170 is a point at which the hypotheses of theorem 1 hold , then theorem 1 yields a lil result for @xmath175 as follows :    suppose that @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath2 continuous in a neighborhood of @xmath3",
    ". then @xmath176 almost surely .",
    "for the problem of estimating a convex decreasing density , @xcite described the limiting distribution of the estimator ( at a point under a natural curvature condition ) in terms of an `` invelope '' of two - sided integrated brownian motion plus @xmath177 which was characterized in @xcite",
    ". the same distribution has appeared in other nonparametric convex function estimation problems , for example for log - concave density estimation : see @xcite . in spite of this description of the limiting distribution for the convex density case in terms of integrated brownian motion , almost nothing is known concerning a direct analytical description of the limit distribution comparable to the results of @xcite for chernoff s distribution .",
    "( on the other hand , a preliminary numerical investigation of the distribution is given by @xcite . )",
    "this leads to the following question : can some information concerning the constants involved in the limiting distribution in the convex function case be obtained by establishing lil results analogous to those established here in the monotone case ?",
    "the second author owes thanks to piet groeneboom for many discussions concerning the grenander estimator and monotone function estimation more generally .",
    "thanks are due as well to david mason for references concerning local lil s for empirical processes ."
