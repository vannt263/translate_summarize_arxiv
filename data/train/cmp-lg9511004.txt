    "because an utterance is best understood in the context in which it is delivered , its interpreters must be able to identify the relevant context and recognize when it is altered , supplanted or revived .",
    "the transient nature of speech makes this task difficult .",
    "however , the difficulty is alleviated by the abundance of lexical and prosodic cues available to a speaker for communicating the location and type of contextual change .",
    "the investigation of the interaction between these cues presupposes a theory of contextual change in discourse .",
    "the theory relating attention , intentions and discourse structure@xcite is particularly useful because it provides a computational account of the current context and the mechanisms of contextual change .",
    "this account frames the questions i investigate about the correlation between between lexical and prosodic cues .",
    "in particular , the theory motivates the selection of the _ cue phrase_@xcite  a word or phrase whose relevance is to structural or rhetorical relations , rather than topic  and the _ unfilled pause _ ( silent pause ) as significant indicators of discourse structure .",
    "to explain the organization of a discourse into topics and subtopics , grosz and sidner postulate three interrelated components of discourse  a linguistic structure , an intentional structure and an attentional state@xcite . in the _ linguistic structure _ , the linear sequence of utterances becomes hierarchical  utterances aggregate into discourse segments , and the discourse segments are organized hierarchically according to the relations among the purposes or _ discourse intentions _ that each satisfies .",
    "the relations among discourse intentions are captured in the _",
    "intentional structure_. it is this organization that is mirrored by the linguistic structure of utterances .",
    "however , while the linguistic structure organizes the verbatim content of discourse segments , the intentional structure contains only the intentions that underlie each segment .",
    "the supposition of an intentional structure explains how discourse coherence is preserved in the absence of a complete history of the discourse .",
    "rather , discourse participants summarize the verbatim contents of a discourse segment by the discourse intention it satisfies .",
    "the contents of a discourse segment are collapsed into an intention , and intentions themselves may be collapsed into intentions of larger scope .",
    "the discourse intention of greatest scope is the discourse purpose ( dp ) , the reason for initiating a discourse . within this ,",
    "discourse segments are introduced to fulfill a particular discourse segment purpose ( dsp ) and thereby contribute to the satisfaction of the overall dp .",
    "a segment terminates when its dsp is satisfied .",
    "similarly , a discourse terminates when the dp that initiated it is satisfied .",
    "the _ attentional state _ is the third component of the tripartite theory .",
    "it models the foci of attention that exist during the construction of intentional structures .",
    "the global focus of attention encompasses those entities relevant to the discourse segment currently under construction , while the local focus ( also called the _",
    "center_@xcite ) is the currently most salient entity in the discourse segment .",
    "the local focus may change from utterance to utterance , while the global focus ( i.e. , current context ) changes only from segment to segment .",
    "the linguistic , intentional and attentional components are interrelated . in particular , the _ attentional state _ describes the processing of the _ discourse segment _ which has been introduced to satisfy the current _ discourse intention_. the functional interrelation is expressed temporally in spoken discourse  the linguistic , intentional and attentional components devoted to one dsp co - occur .",
    "therefore , a change in one component reflects or induces changes in the rest .",
    "for example , changes ascribed to the attentional state indicate changes in the intentional structure , and moreover , are recognized via qualitative changes in the linguistic structure .",
    "it is because of their interdependence and synchrony that i can postulate the hypothesis that co - occurring linguistic and attentional phenomena in spoken discourse  cue phrases , pauses and discourse structure and processing  are linked .",
    "the part of the theory most directly relevant to my investigation are those constructs that model the attentional state .",
    "these are the _ focus space _ and the _ focus space stack_. the _ focus space _ is the computational representation of processing in the current context , that is , for the discourse segment currently under construction . within a focus space dwell representations of the entities evoked during the construction of the segment  propositions , relations , objects in the world and the dsp of the current discourse segment .",
    "a focus space lives on a pushdown stack called the _ focus space stack_. the progression of focus in a discourse is modeled via the basic stack operations  pushes and pops  applied to the stack elements .",
    "for example , _ closure _ of a discourse segment is modeled by _ popping _ its associated focus space from the stack ; _ introduction _ of a segment is modeled by _ pushing _ its associated focus space onto the stack ; _ retention _ of the current discourse segment is modeled by leaving its focus space on the stack in order to add or modify its elements .",
    "the contents of a focus space whose dsp is satisfied are accrued in the longer lasting intentional structure .",
    "thus , at the end of a discourse the focus space stack is empty while the intentional structure is fully constructed .",
    "the focus space model abstracts the processing that all participants must do in order to accurately track and affect the flow of discourse .",
    "thus , it treats the emerging discourse structure and the changing attentional foci as publicly accessible properties of the discourse .",
    "although the participants themselves may act as if they are manipulating public structures , the informational and attentional properties of a discourse are , in fact , modeled only privately .    in explaining certain lexical and prosodic features of discourse , it is often useful to return to these private models . for a speaker s utterance",
    "is conditioned both by the state of the her own model and by her beliefs about those of her interlocutors . the time ",
    "dependent nature of speech emphasizes the importance of synchronizing private models .",
    "lexical and prosodic focusing cues hasten synchronization .",
    "in particular , they guide the listeners in updating their models ( among them , the focus space stack ) to reflect the attentional changes already in effect for the speaker .    for my analysis",
    ", the most relevant private model belongs to the _ current speaker _ , whose discourse intentions guide , for the moment , the flow of topic and attention in a discourse and whose spoken contributions provide the richest evidence of attentional state .",
    "if cue phrases and unfilled pause durations can be shown to correlate with attentional state ( and by definition , the intentional and linguistic structure ) , the attentional state they reveal belongs to the current speaker , and the attentional changes they denote are the ones the speaker makes in her own private model .",
    "the theory of the tripartite nature of discourse frames my hypotheses about the correlation of cue phrases , pause duration and discourse structure .",
    "the main hypotheses are these : that particular unfilled pause durations tend to correlate with particular cue phrases and that this correlation is occasioned by changes to the attentional state of the discourse participants , or , equivalently , by the emerging intentional structure of a discourse .",
    "changes to the attentional state occur at segment boundaries .",
    "cue phrases by definition evince these changes  they are utterance and segment - initial words or phrases and they inform on structural or rhetorical relations rather than on topic . thus , for cue phrases",
    ", the question is not whether they correlate with attentional state , but how . to answer this question",
    ", we ask , for each cue phrase ( e.g. , _ now , to begin with , so _ ) , whether it signals particular and distinct changes to the attentional state .",
    "the correlation of unfilled pauses with attentional state is less certain because pauses appear at all levels of discourse structure .",
    "they are found within and between the smallest grammatical phrase , the sentence , the utterance , the speaking turn and the discourse segment .",
    "their correlation is mainly with the cognitive difficulty of producing a phrase or utterance@xcite . to link this correlation with the task of producing discourse structure",
    ", we must posit a variety of attentional operations with corresponding variability in cognitive difficulty . specifically",
    ", we construct the chain of assumptions that : @xmath0 @xmath0 @xmath0    to link unfilled pause duration to discourse structure we must first establish that operations on the attentional state can be distinguished sufficiently to explain the different demands that each operation makes on discourse processing and which , therefore , might be reflected in the duration of segment - initial unfilled pauses .",
    "the linking of pause duration to the processing of discourse segments motivates some auxiliary hypotheses that refine notions about the kinds of mental operations sanctioned by the focus space model and about the internal structure of a discourse segment .",
    "these auxiliary hypotheses are developed in this section .      in the theory of discourse structure ,",
    "changes to the attentional state are modeled as operations on the focus space stack .",
    "these operations appear reducible to four distinct sequences of stack operations that correspond to four distinct effects on the attentional state , as follows : @xmath0 @xmath0 @xmath0   @xmath0    the arrangement is asymmetrical in that it is possible to pop more than one focus space per operation , but to push only one , as shown in table  [ focusspaceops ] .",

    "p_@xmath1.001 ) .",
    "this finding might partially explain the long pauses that appear before a _ replace _",
    ", since a _ replace _ is the focusing operation most likely to affect the most focus spaces , by definition , it requires [ almost ] everything to be popped from the focusing before the initiation ( push ) of a new focus space .",

    "thus far , analysis of the data identifies significantly longer pauses for the _ replace _ operation than for any other and shows that pause duration is positively correlated with the number of segments affected by one focusing operation .",
    "these findings begin to distinguish the focusing operations quantitatively , by number of focus spaces affected , and qualitatively , by whether they occur within an established context ( _ initiate , retain , return _ ) or at its beginning ( _ replace _ ) .",
    "although , the raw data in table  [ rawdata ] appears to show patterns for specific segment - initial tokens , the number of tokens is insufficient for establishing a correlation between cue phrase and focusing operations , let alone a three - way relationship among cue phrase , pause duration and focusing tasks .",

    ", the difference between mean pause durations at best only approaches significance ( see table  [ 24  [ marked - unmarked ] ) .",

    "together they identify the factors that would impel a speaker to precede an utterance with a cue phrase , an unfilled pause or both .",
    "if an unfilled pause preceding a lexically unmarked fragment is significantly longer , we might assume that a particular focusing operation is executed in a characteristic amount of time ( given adequate consideration of other contextual features ) .",
    "within this time , we might observe silence , a cue phrase or both .    because both pause and cue phrase can appear at the same location in a phrase",
    ", we ask if their functions are equivalent , or instead , complementary .",
    "my hypothesis selects the second option , that they are complementary in the cognitive processing each reflects and in the discourse functions each fulfills . for",
    ", if the duration of an unfilled pause is evidence of the difficulty of a cognitive task , a cue phrase is evidence of its partial resolution .    as a communicative device",
    ", cue phrases are more cooperative than silence . in silence",
    ", a listener can only guess at the current contents of the speaker s models .",
    "with the uttering of a cue phrase , the listener is at least notified that the speaker is constructing a response .",
    "the minimal cue in this regard is the filled pause . _",
    "bone fide _ cue phrases , however , herald not only an upcoming utterance , but a particular direction of focus and even a propositional relation between prior and upcoming speech .",
    "cue phrases serve not only the listener but also the speaker . because they commit to topic structure , but not to specific referents and discourse entities",
    ", they buy additional time for the speaker in which to complete a focusing operation and formulate the remainder of the utterance .",
    "the account of the influence of the currently observable state of the discourse rests on two patterns in the data : ( 1 ) the difference in pause durations for marked and unmarked _ initiate_s and _ retain_s is minimal ; and ( 2 ) the difference between marked and unmarked _ return_s and _ replace_s is greater .",
    "if these patterns can be shown to be significant , they suggest that remaining in the current context is less costly than returning to a former context , or establishing a new one .",
    "the corollary is the claim that an expected focusing operation need not be marked , while an unexpected operation is most felicitous when marked .    in other words ,",
    "remaining in the current context or entering a subordinate context is expected behavior , while exiting the current context is not .",
    "exiting the current context ( focus space ) carries a greater risk of disrupting a mutual view of discourse structures .",
    "the extent of risk is assessed for the listener by the difficulty of tracking the change and for the speaker , by the difficulty of executing it .",
    "the risk originates in the nondeterministic definitions of _ return _ and _ replace _ operations  both contain in their structure one or more pops .",
    "in addition , these operations can be confused because both begin identically , with a series of pops .    because closing a focus space is a marked behavior , the clues to changing focus are most cooperative if they guide the listener toward re - invoking a prior context ( i.e. , a _ return _ ) or establishing a new one ( replace ) .",
    "thus , certain clues are more likely to mark a return to a former context ( e.g. , _ so , anyway , as i was saying _ ) , while others ( _ now _ , the ordinal phrases ) mark a _",
    "replace_.      the goal of future investigations is to establish the bases for predicting the appearance of particular acoustical and lexical features .",
    "the speculations presented in this section provide a theoretical framework .",
    "if borne out , they can be re - fashioned as characterizations of the circumstances in which cue phrases and unfilled pauses are most likely to be used .",
    "the relationships among cue phrases , unfilled pauses and the structuring of discourse are investigated within the paradigm of the tripartite model of discourse . within this model",
    ", the postulation of four focusing operations provides an operational framework to which can be tied the discourse functions of cue phrases and the cognitive activity associated with the production of an utterance .",
    "especially , the difficulty of utterance production might be explained by the complexity of the co - occurring focusing operation .",
    "such a correspondence is , in fact , suggested by the positive correlation of pause duration and the number of focus spaces opened or closed in one operation on the focus space stack .",
    "however , because the classification of focusing operations is uncertain , more data and better tests are required to characterize the relationships among the lexical and acoustical correlates of topic and focus .",
    "in addition , the aptness of the tripartite model itself is not assured .",
    "the idealizations it contains may undergo modification in light of new results , or be augmented by other accounts of discourse processing . on the other hand , the analysis of more quantitative data may confirm the implications of the model , and its appropriateness as the foundation for investigating the lexical and prosodic features of discourse .",
