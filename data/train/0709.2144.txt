    "practical quantum information processing will rely on deterministic computational gates and high - fidelity communication protocols that operate successfully on - demand @xcite .",
    "this requires realtime generation of entanglement amongst arbitrary qubits performed at near - unit success probability and fidelity . for atom - type qubits ,",
    "this entanglement can be generated either via a photonic channel , utilizing entangled photon - pairs @xcite or cavity - decay photons @xcite , or an atomic channel as in recent trapped - ion experiments @xcite .",
    "for high - speed quantum computation and/or long - distance communication , a photonic quantum channel is clearly ideal , as photons are robust carriers of quantum information that travel at the speed of light . since isolated trapped - atomic qubits have long coherence times and are easily manipulated with electromagnetic fields , it is of general interest to consider the problem of creating entanglement between two isolated atomic qubits via their mutual interaction with a single photonic channel .",
    "the primary obstacle to such a protocol lies in the problem of eliminating spontaneous emission while obtaining a sufficiently strong atom - photon interaction .",
    "recent attempts to overcome this difficulty have primarily relied on the use of collective - state qubits in atomic ensembles to enhance the dipole moment of the qubit @xcite .",
    "this enhancement effect has allowed duan , cirac , zoller and polzik to implement a quantum teleportation scheme between two atomic samples , where a coherent beam is passed successively through and the entanglement is generated by measuring its final faraday - rotation angle @xcite .",
    "very recently , a probabilistic scheme to entangle two distant quantum dots using cavity enhancement has been proposed using bright coherent light via homodyne detection and postselection @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate an approach in which _",
    "single_-atom qubits are deterministically entangled by use of an optical interferometer , thus avoiding collisional decoherence mechanisms inherent in atomic ensembles .",
    "it is well - known that the back - action of a single atom onto a focused laser pulse is very weak , so that generating useful atom - photon entanglement in this manner will generally fail due to spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "our goal , however , is to overcome this difficulty by using the extreme sensitivity of sub - shot - noise interferometers @xcite to detect the weak phase imprinted on the forward scattered light in the regime where spontaneous emission is negligible .",
    "in addition , we also consider the more generic approach of using high - finesse optical resonators @xcite to enhance the atom - photon interaction .",
    "our interferometry apparatus follows the faraday - rotation scheme of duan , cirac , zoller , and polzik @xcite , with the collective atomic ensembles replaced by single trapped atoms , and with the coherent light replaced by a highly non - classical many - photon state .",
    "we first show that for a mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer with coherent input , a high - finesse q - switch cavity is always necessary , and to achieve a fidelity of @xmath2 requires an optical cavity which cycles photon for @xmath3 times .",
    "if the coherent state input is replaced with a twin - fock ( tf ) input state , however , we find that a cavity is in principle no longer required .",
    "cavity feedback may still provide additional improvement in performance .",
    "for example , @xmath2 can be achieved if we use the tf state with @xmath4 photons and no cavity , or only two photons and cavities with @xmath5 .",
    "the later requires a single photon - on - demand @xcite injected into each interferometer input , with an accurate measurement of the two - photon output state , which appears within the realm of experimental feasibility .",
    "both mz - interferometer - based approaches require detectors with single - photon resolution @xcite .",
    "this requirement , however , can be overcome by employing a non - mz interferometer based on noon states and nonlinear beamsplitters .",
    "such an interferometer yields a sensitivity close to the tf state in detecting phase imbalance , and thus can achieve similar performance without counting single photons . while the tf and noon states have recently been shown as unable to measure any phase below shot - noise in a single measurement @xcite , our present work shows that single - measurements with these states can still be highly useful as ` quantum switches ' with heisenberg - limited sensitivity .    our proposed interferometry approach to entangle atomic - qubits can be performed on - demand and is scalable .",
    "we envision generalizing such a device to a complete set of quantum information processing protocols whereby stationary single - atom qubits are held in isolated traps , with arbitrary single - atom and multi - atom operations achieved via sequences of light pulses guided amongst the atoms and into detectors by fast optical switching .",
    "the goal of this paper is to perform a theoretical analysis of interferometrical generation of entanglement between two arbitrary qubits , and to determine the fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[model ] , we present a basic model of the interferometrical generation of entanglement between two atomic qubits . in sec.[cohrt ] and sec.[twinfock ] , we study two mz - interferometrical approaches using the coherent and the tf input light field , respectively . then in sec.[noon ] , we investigate an alternative approach employing noon states and nonlinear beamsplitters . in sec.[app ] , as examples , we briefly show how the present scheme can be applied to realize deterministic teleportation , multi - site entanglement , and entanglement swapping .",
    "this is followed by a short discussian and conclusion in sec.[conclusion ]",
    "in our scheme , a single pulse of light is passed through an optical interferometer , with the different arms of the interferometer corresponding to different photon polarization states .",
    "the beam passes through two atomic qubits , i.e. trapped ions , neutral atoms and/or quantum dots , such that each polarization state interacts with a different internal atomic state .",
    "this can be achieved using an x-type scheme , as described in @xcite , in which the zeeman sublevels of an @xmath6 ground state form the qubit , or in a @xmath7-type level scheme , with the @xmath8 states of an @xmath9 ground state forming the qubits . in both cases",
    ", the arms of the interferometer would correspond to orthogonal circular polarization states .",
    "the interferometer output is determined by a state - dependent phase - shift acquired via the atom - photon interaction .",
    "this requires a large detuning from the atomic resonance , as there is no phase acquired on resonance .",
    "measurement of a phase imbalance at the interferometer output can not determine which qubit contributed the phase - shift , resulting in entanglement between them .",
    "we consider atomic qubits based on two degenerate hyperfine states , arbitrarily labeled as @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for a general consideration , our goal is to entangle two uncorrelated qubits , labeled @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are initially in states of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the qubits are placed inside an optical interferometer with the setup depicted in fig.[fig1 ] , where the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 interact with photons in the upper arm of the interferometer , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 interact with the lower .",
    "such interaction is represented by the qubit - photon interaction propagator , @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the annihilation operator for an atom at location @xmath17 in internal state @xmath24 .",
    "this interaction operator is valid in the far - off - resonance regime , where the electronically excited state can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "the interaction is governed by the phase - shift @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the atom - photon interaction time , @xmath27 is the detuning between the laser and atomic resonance frequencies , @xmath28 is the electric dipole moment and @xmath29 is the ` electric field per photon ' for laser frequency @xmath30 and mode - volume @xmath31 . introducing the spontaneous emission rate @xmath32 , taking the photon mode as having length @xmath33 and width @xmath34 ( at the location of the atom ) , and taking the interaction time as @xmath35 , we arrive at the single - atom phase - shift @xmath36 ^ 2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the laser wavelength .",
    "this is the phase - shift acquired by an off - resonant photon forward - scattered by a single atom , and is independent of the pulse length .",
    "the interferometer output is then determined by the phase - shift acquired via the atom - photon interaction .",
    "introducing the qubit - pair basis @xmath38 with @xmath39 , the states @xmath40 and @xmath41 both correspond to a balanced interferometer with zero net phase - shift , and thus constitute a ` balanced ' qubit - pair subspace .",
    "in contrast , the states @xmath42 and @xmath43 have equal and opposite non - zero phase - shifts , and thus constitute an ` imbalanced ' subspace . measuring the photon number distribution at the interferometer output distinguishes between zero and nonzero magnitudes of the phase - shifts , and thus collapses the qubits onto the balanced or imbalanced subspaces , based on which entanglement between the two is established .",

    "the basic set - up for entanglement generation using mz interferometer is shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the mz interferometer consists of two 50/50 linear beamsplitters .",
    "the input light field is bifurcated at the first beamsplitter , guided to interact sequently with the qubits , and then recombined at the second beamsplitter .",

    "it is now evident that the interferometer output is determined by the joint states of the qubits .",
    "the states @xmath40 and @xmath41 result in zero phase - shifts with @xmath55 , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 result in equation and opposite phases with @xmath56 .",
    "if the interferometer is incapable of distinguishing positive and negative phases , a measurement of the output light field will therefore collapse the qubits onto either balanced or imbalanced subspaces , and in this way generate entanglement between them .",
    "we note that our mz interferometer scheme is closely related to the faraday - rotation scheme of duan _ et al _ @xcite , which effectively replaces the first beamsplitter with a linear - polarized initial coherent state .",
    "in fact , for the special case of a circularly polarized coherent state at one input port and vacuum at the other , the present mz interferometry scheme maps directly to the faraday - rotation scheme . as we will show next , an interferometer of this class is limited to shot - noise sensitivity , and will thus not work when the ensembles are replaced by single atoms without the introduction of extremely high - finesse optical resonators .",
    "viewing the faraday - rotation scheme instead as a mz interferometer clearly highlights the possibility to incorporate non - classical input states to achieve sub - shot - noise sensitivity , which is the focus of the present manuscript .",
    "for the coherent - state input , the upper channel , described by creation operator @xmath57 , is initially in a coherent state , while the lower channel @xmath58 is in the vacuum state .",
    "a detector is used to count the photons coming from the upper output channel , while output in the lower channel is unmeasured . a null result , meaning zero photons detected , results in the qubits collapsing onto the balanced subspace , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the intrinsic state error due to the possibility of a false null result .",
    "this error , which adds imbalanced states to the desired balanced subspace , sets the upper limit of the obtainable teleportation fidelity .",
    "if @xmath61 photons are detected , the qubits will collapse onto imbalanced subspace @xmath62 without intrinsic error .",
    "we note that the possibility of a dark count _ will _ introduce an analogous error , but this error rate is governed by technical aspects of the photo - detector , and is presumably not an intrinsic quantum error .    to derive these results for coherent input state , the initial state of the complete system is given by equation ( [ input ] ) , with @xmath63 following equation ( [ output ] ) ,",
    "the state of the system at the interferometer output is obtained as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and the states @xmath66 indicate optical coherent states for the upper and lower interferometer outputs , respectively .",

    "the remaining time , a photon - number @xmath61 is detected , with the qubit - state collapsing onto the imbalanced space with unit fidelity , @xmath84 the @xmath85 term comes from the phase difference between number - states for the coherent states @xmath86 and @xmath87 , i.e. while measuring photon number can not distinguish the states @xmath42 and @xmath43 , it can introduce relative phase between them .",
    "if the photon number is definitely non - zero , yet not measured exactly , then tracing over the photon number creates a statistical mixture of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in this case",
    ", the protocol would create an entangled state with non - unity success probability @xmath7 , but success would be heralded by the verification of zero photons in the upper output .",
    "most likely , the initial state @xmath88 would be prepared so that @xmath89 . for entanglement on - demand , however , it is necessary to determine the photon number exactly .",
    "this difficulty is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the average photon number is @xmath90 , i.e. only @xmath91 photons must be counted for @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "leaving the lower output unmeasured means that computing the output state requires tracing over the lower mode . in the proceeding derivation",
    "we have taken this trace to be unity . in reality , it is less than unity due to the non - orthogonality of the balanced and imbalanced lower output states , governed by the overlap @xmath95 here , @xmath96 is the mean input photon number and the last equality is because our scheme requires @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting error is then @xmath97 , which can be neglected for large @xmath98 .",
    "this result validates the small - angle approximation made for the final state as in ( [ small - angle ] ) , where the lower - channel light field is assumed @xmath99-independent and factorized from the remaining system .    the overall fidelity due to state error in this interferometrical entanglement generation is obtained by averaging over the null- and not - null- results , giving @xmath100 since @xmath101 , it is always @xmath102 , regardless of the quantum states of the two qubits .    aside from the technical challenge of single - photon counting ,",
    "the fundamental quantum - mechanical barrier to successful teleportation lies in finding a balance between phase - shift detection and spontaneous - emission avoidance , as a single spontaneously scattered photon can destroy the coherence of a qubit .",
    "the spontaneous emission probability for a single qubit is @xmath103 , which becomes negligible when @xmath104 .",
    "this condition must be satisfied without violating the shot - noise - sensitivity condition @xmath83 . from equation ( [ theta ] )",
    "it follows that compatibility requires @xmath105 , which clearly violates the standard optical diffraction limit .",
    "that such a scheme can therefore not work is in agreement with common understanding @xcite .      to overcome the effects of spontaneous emission , we can place the two qubits in seperate high - finesse optical cavities , with mechanical q - switching employed to restrict the photon to @xmath106 passes through each qubit .",
    "this will increase the phase - shift @xmath99 and the spontaneous emission probability @xmath107 by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "this relaxes the compatibility condition to @xmath108 , which can be satisfied without sub - wavelength focussing .",

    "for these parameters , the mean number of photons in the upper output is @xmath114 , and the input photon number is restricted only by the condition @xmath115 , together with the off - resonant condition @xmath116 .",
    "a main difficulty in long - distance quantum communication is photon loss during qubit - to - qubit transmission , where the loss probability increase exponentially with the transport distance . in schemes based on cavity - qed @xcite ,",
    "atomic qubits states are encoded in the internal ( polarization ) states of photons , and thus a lost photon will immediately reveal the atomic states and destroy the qubits via decoherence .",
    "in contrast , during an interferometrical communication , the qubits state information is encoded in a form of relative phase - shifts of photons propagating in the upper and lower arms .",
    "such a shift is not a measurable quantity until the two channels are recombined at a second beamsplitter .",
    "thus the lost photon can not reveal the state of the qubit , and one might suspect that the qubit coherence would be preserved . on the other hand , due to the photon - atom interaction , a lost photons will introduce a small relative phase - shift to the qubits .",
    "the magnitude of the relative phase is @xmath99 , but the sign depends on which interferometer ` arm ' lost the photon .",
    "tracing over which arm thus results in effective decoherence and thus a reduction in the fidelity of entanglement .    to see this ,",

    "in above sections , we have discussed generating entanglement between atomic qubits using an optical mz interferometer with coherent and tf input states . while both are shown to be able to achieve a close - to - unit fidelity in the presence of intrinsic quantum errors , they require precise measurement of output light field at the single - photon level . in this section ,",
    "we show this requirement can be overcome by using a non - mz interferometer based on noon states and nonlinear beamsplitters @xcite .",
    "a noon state is a shrdinger cat state that corresponds to an equally - weighted superposition of all - upper - channel and all - lower - channel states @xcite @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the relative phase which we take for zero for simplicity .",
    "the nonlinear beamsplitter can either be a four - wave mixer @xcite or a quantum circuit constructed from c - not gates @xcite . without further explaining its operational mechanism or examining the practical feasibility , for present we simply treat the action of such beamsplitters with a projecting operator @xmath216 of the general form @xmath217 where for simplicity we let the relative phases @xmath218 .",
    "note for the four - wave mixer , this projector is valid only for even - number @xmath219 . using this nonlinear beamsplitter ,",
    "a noon state can be generated from a single fock state @xmath220 , i.e. , by injecting @xmath98 photons in its upper input channel .",
    "the set - up of the noon - state interferometer differs from a mz interferometer in that now the first beamsplitter is dropped ( or more precisely , it is formally replaced by the assumption of a noon input state ) while the second one is replaced by the nonlinear beamsplitter , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) . for measurement , a photo detector",
    "is placed in the lower ( or equivalently , the upper ) output port to detect the presence of outcoming photons , while without counting them .",
    "because the output light field is consisted of @xmath220 and @xmath221 states , corresponding to all photons coming out from upper or lower port , a photon detector with a resolution of @xmath222 would be sufficient to distinguish them .",
    "this exhibit an essentially improvement from the previous mz interferometry schemes , where the detector resolution must be less than one .",
    "a null result , meaning no photon is detected at the lower channel , will collapse the qubits onto @xmath223 with @xmath224 the intrinsic state error due to a false - null result .",
    "in contrast , if the detector is trigged , the qubits will collapse into the imbalanced subspace @xmath225 here , we emphasize that this state is independent on the exact number difference @xmath69 between the upper and lower outputs .",
    "this is essentially different from the corresponding ones in ( [ unbl1 ] ) with the coherent state and in ( [ unbalance ] ) with the tf state , both of which are dependent on @xmath69 .    to derive these results",
    ", we follow the previous approach and find the final state of system as @xmath2260,n\\rangle ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have dropped an irrelevant global - phase term in the last step .",
    "the probability of a null result is thus @xmath227 with @xmath228 is the intrinsic error rate . on detecting this null result",
    ", the qubits will collapse onto @xmath229 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath228 is the false null rate .",
    "the corresponding fidelity is then @xmath230 the remaining time , a not - null result is detected , projecting the qubits onto the imbalanced subspace , @xmath231 the overall fidelity averaging over the null and not - null results is given by @xmath232    the fidelity in this entanglement generation is thus similar to the mz interferometry cases but with the intrinsic error rate given by @xmath139 . a comparison of @xmath233 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where it is shown that for @xmath234 , @xmath139 is close to @xmath138 , exhibiting a heisenberg - limited phase sensitivity .",
    "furthermore , @xmath139 is exact zero at @xmath235 , compared to at @xmath236 for @xmath138 .",
    "this means the noon - state interferometer can achieve similar performances with the tf state .",
    "the fidelity after taking into account the possibility of spontaneous emission therefore scales as @xmath237 .",
    "a fidelity of @xmath2 and @xmath172 will then require @xmath238 and @xmath239 photons , respectively .",
    "since there is no requirement on exactly counting output photons , @xmath98 can in principle be made large , allowing an arbitrary close - to - unit fidelity , at least quantum mechanically . finally ,",
    "similar to tf state , in order to suppress false - null rate , for a fidelity of @xmath240 , @xmath99 must be tuned within an interval of @xmath241 with @xmath242 .",
    "the present entanglement generation using noon states will be completely disrupted by a single - photon loss .",
    "this is due to the fact that a randomly lost photon will immediately collapse the noon state to a statistical mixture of all - upper - channel and all - lower - channel states , whose reduced density is given by @xmath243 this mixture state is apparently incapable of detecting phase imbalances .",
    "this problem , however , might be overcome by using a class of less - extreme cat - like states @xcite .",
    "such a states corresponds to a symmetric superposition of two well - separated wavepackets in number - difference space . in the case of small photon losses , instead of being completely destroyed , they will decay into a mixture of smaller - sized cat - like states , which are still suitable for the purpose of detecting phase imbalance .",
    "hence , asides from a reduction in fidelity due to phase randomization , faithful entanglement might be generated despite of photon loss .",
    "a further study of generating entanglement using less - extreme cat - like states will be presented in future work .    finally , we note that the present noon - state interferometer relies on highly nonclassical light source with definite photon number",
    ". this requirement is , however , not a necessary .",
    "for example , our scheme can be directly extended to use more classical cat input states that correspond to the superposition of coherent states , @xmath244 such a state can be rewritten as , @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the coefficient of the coherent state and can be approximated by @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the normalization factor . a state yielding this distribution but containing only even @xmath249s",
    "has been proposed to generate probabilistically with a success probability of half , where a single coherent light and a four - wave mixer are employed @xcite . with this input ,",
    "the final state of the system becomes @xmath2500,m\\rangle],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by choosing @xmath235 , similar to the single noon state , upon detecting photons from the lower port , the qubit will collapse to imbalanced subspace ( [ imb - noon ] ) .",
    "otherwise , if no photon is detected from the lower port , the qubits will collapse to the state ( [ blan - noon ] ) but with the false null rate given by @xmath251 since @xmath235 , we have @xmath252 , which is negligible compare to the fidelity reduction ( @xmath253 ) due to the probability of spontaneous emission .    to conclude , in this section , we have shown that a noon - state interferometer can achieve similar performance with the tf state , yet without the requirement for precisely measuring the output light field . while this scheme is not tolerant of a single photon loss , this problem might be overcome by using a class of less extreme cat states . also , besides using a single noon input state with definite photon number , we showed the present scheme can also use a class of states with indefinite photons that correspond to the superposition of noon states .",
    "the present interferometrical method of generating entanglement can serve as a basic protocol in the quantum information processing , based on which quantum computation and communication can be realized with the aid of local qubit operations . as an example , here we first show how it can be used to teleport an arbitrary quantum state from one qubit to another .",
    "we assume the @xmath12-qubit is the source qubit carrying an unknown teleporting quantum state , and @xmath13-qubit is target qubit which the state is transported to .",
    "the @xmath12-qubit is initially in the state @xmath254 while the @xmath13-qubit is initially prepared as @xmath255 we first collapse the two qubits into entangled qubit - pair interferometrically using our method .",
    "once the qubit - pair is generated , completing the teleportation requires that the qubits be disentangled .",
    "this can be accomplished in the following manner .",
    "conditional upon a null result , a @xmath256-pulse is applied to the source qubit , flipping @xmath257 . when using a mz interferometer with the coherent or tf state , in the case of an odd measured @xmath69",
    ", an additional relative @xmath256 phase must be applied to the state @xmath258 ( or @xmath259 ) .",
    "after these steps , the qubits state becomes @xmath260 a @xmath261-pulse is then applied to the source ( or the target ) qubit , transforming the state into @xmath262/\\sqrt{2}.\\ ] ] this is followed by a state measurement of @xmath12-qubit .",
    "if it is measured @xmath18 , the @xmath13-qubit will collapse to @xmath263 after which a @xmath261 phase is imprinted onto @xmath21 .",
    "otherwise , it is measured in @xmath20 , and a @xmath261 phase is imprinted onto @xmath19 .",
    "after these conditional operations , the @xmath13-qubit will end up in the desired state @xmath264 which accomplishes the teleportation .",
    "besides the state teleportation between two qubits , our scheme can be easily generalized to generate many - qubit entanglement @xcite as well as realize entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "for example , the three - particle greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , @xmath265 can be created by first preparing each qubit in the state @xmath266 with @xmath267 .",
    "then the two - qubit protocol is used to collapse @xmath12 and @xmath13 into the state @xmath268 + if the same two - qubit procedure is applied to @xmath269 and @xmath270 , the ghz state is obtained .",
    "this simple scheme can be extended in a straightforward manner to producing an @xmath98-particle shrdinger cat state .    to realize entanglement swapping , we take an initially entangled qubit - pair , @xmath271 and an uncorrelated third qubit @xmath272 and apply our protocol to qubits @xmath13 and @xmath273 to create a ghz - like state .",
    "then , by disentangling @xmath13 in the same manner as described for the source qubit in teleportation , we arrive at the desired swapped state @xmath274",
    "in conclusion , we have used the formalism of the optical interferometer to treat the problem of creating entanglement amongst single - atom qubits via a common photonic channel .",
    "we have compared the results from a mz - interferometer with a coherent input state and high - finesse cavity enhancement , a mz - interferometer with tf input and those from a non - mz interferometer based on the noon state and nonlinear beamsplitter .",
    "our results suggest that high - fidelity entanglement can in principle be generated via any of the interferometrical approaches .",
    "experimental feasible schemes under current techniques are found by combining hisenberg - limited interferometer with photon resonators . in particular , we find that a two - photon input state has a fundamental upper - limit to fidelity of @xmath0 , and provides the advantage that failure due to photon losses could be readily detected .",
    "our interferometrical approaches of generating entanglement is operated on - demand and is scalable , and thus can serve as a universal protocol in quantum information processing , based on which quantum computation and communication can be realized with the aid of single - qubit operations ."
