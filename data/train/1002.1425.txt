    "it is shown that the theory reduces to a _ nonlinear _ and nonlocal modification of poisson s equation of newtonian gravity .",
    "the exploration of the nonlinear aspects of this equation is beyond the scope of the present work ; therefore , we ignore the nonlinear part of this equation and concentrate on the simpler case of the linear poisson equation .",
    "this turns out to be equivalent to the tohline - kuhn scheme of modified newtonian gravity as an alternative to dark matter @xcite .",
    "indeed , on galactic scales , the nonlocal deviation of the gravitational interaction from the inverse - square force law could be responsible for observational data that have been attributed to the presence of dark matter . as a preliminary step , we study some of the implications of the linear nonlocal theory for observations within the solar system .",

    "moreover , the stable manifold of this rest point is tangent to the line with parametrization @xmath249    a solution of the system whose orbit lies on this stable manifold is asymptotic to a corresponding solution of the linearization on the linearized stable manifold ( which is exactly the line in display  ) .",

    "the gauge theory of translations was recently employed in @xcite .",
    "now , the gauge theory of translations itself is a somewhat degenerate subcase of the gauge theory of the poincar group , the so - called `` poincar gauge theory of gravity '' . in turn",

    "it is convenient to express the lagrangian in terms of the excitations : @xmath286 this lagrangian will also be valid in the nonlocal case .",
    "we now generalize the local `` constitutive relations '' ( [ excittr ] ) and ( [ excitrot ] ) to nonlocal ones , again as in @xcite , by using an unknown scalar kernel @xmath287 and the world function @xmath288 and its derivatives for transporting tensors from @xmath289 to @xmath290 : @xmath291},\\\\ \\label{excitnonl3 } \\stackrel{\\text{qu}}{{\\cal      h}}{}^{ij}{}_{kl } ( { x})&=\\frac{\\sqrt{-g(x)}}{\\xi }   \\int u ( { x } , { x}')\\omega^{ii ' } \\omega^{jj ' } \\omega_{kk'}\\omega_{ll'}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{-30pt}\\times \\chi ( { x } , { x}')\\sum_{k=1}^6 c_k \\ , ^{(k)}r_{i'j'}{}^{k'l ' } ( { x}')\\sqrt{-g(x ' ) } d^4x',\\\\   \\label{excitnonl4 } { \\cal    h}^{ij}{}_{kl}&=\\stackrel{\\text{lin}}{{\\cal h}}{}^{ij}{}_{kl}+   \\stackrel{\\text{qu}}{{\\cal h}}{}^{ij}{}_{kl}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the final field equations will not be written down explicitly .",
