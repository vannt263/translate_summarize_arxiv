    "boltzmann pondered on how to understand thermodynamics with the newton s equations ; his answer to this question along with gibbs theory have become the foundation of classical statistical mechanics  @xcite . after quantum mechanics been fully formulated , many giants in physics discussed a similar issue : how to understand thermodynamics with the schrdinger equation  @xcite . in a 1929 paper ,",
    "von neumann provided an answer to this question by proving two inequalities  in full rigor and without disorder assumptions \"  @xcite .",
    "these two inequalities , which he called the quantum ergordic theorem and the quantum h - theorem , respectively , laid down a foundation for quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "however , this work has been largely forgotten and apparently have never been mentioned in any modern textbook on quantum statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "there are discussions on why this work had almost been forgotten  @xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "one of the likely reasons is that von neumann introduced a rather unfamiliar concept , _ macroscopic operators _ , to prove his theorems .",
    "it appears very hard to compute these commuting macroscopic operators , and related variables such as an entropy defined for a pure quantum state  @xcite .",
    "recently there have been renewed interests on the foundation of quantum statistical mechanics  @xcite perhaps due to the remarkable progress in experimental realization of coherent quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "an important result achieved is an inequality proved by reimann  @xcite and later modified by short _",
    "et al.@xcite .",
    "this inequality can be regarded as a different version of von neumann s quantum ergodic theorem .",
    "the advantage of this new inequality is that every variable involved is well known and can be computed . for this reason , when we discuss quantum ergodic theorem , we refer to the inequality proved by reimann unless stated otherwise . _    according to the quantum ergodic theorem , an isolated quantum system starting with a far - from - equilibrium state will relax dynamically to an equilibrium state and stay there with very small fluctuations for almost all the time . to be more specific , for an isolated quantum system described by the wave function @xmath0",
    ", it will relax to the following equilibrium state _ = _ k |c_k|^2 , where @xmath1 is the energy eigenstate of the system and @xmath2 s are the expansion coefficients of @xmath0 in term of these eigenstates .",
    "the density matrix @xmath3 is regarded as the micro - canonical ensemble by von neumann  @xcite .",
    "it is different from the usual micro - canonical ensemble found in textbooks  @xcite , where the coefficients @xmath2 s take an identical value within a narrow energy shell .",
    "as @xmath4 s do not change with time , the micro - canonical density matrix @xmath3 is completely determined by the initial condition . by utilizing this fact and the supposition principle",
    ", we were able to predict a new quantum state which is at equilibrium with multiple temperatures , challenging the conventional wisdom that an equilibrium state has only one temperature  @xcite .",
    "the quantum ergodic theorem holds only for quantum systems with no degenerate energy gaps .",
    "mathematically , this condition is expressed as  @xcite @xmath5 however , it is not clear at all how this condition of non - degenerate energy gap is related to the familiar classification of quantum systems by their integrability . for a general integrable system , this condition is not satisfied as quantum integrable systems have the poisson distribution of energy level spacing  @xcite , which imply the existence of many degenerate eigen - energies . however , there are plenty of examples of integrable systems , which have no energy degeneracy at all .",
    "in fact , there are already reports of dynamical relaxation in integrable systems  @xcite .",
    "the case for quantum chaotic systems is more complicated . as is well known , quantum chaotic systems have the wigner distribution of energy level spacing  @xcite .",
    "the wigner distribution has two prominent features : zero probability at zero energy level spacing and a peak at a finite energy level spacing .",
    "the former feature means that there is little degeneracy , which is favorite for the condition ( [ condition ] ) being satisfied .",
    "the latter implies that there are large number of energy level spacings around the peak value , which is clearly unfavorite for the condition ( [ condition ] ) being satisfied . as a result , it is not clear at all in the sense of mathematical rigor whether the quantum ergodic theorem and h - theorem hold for quantum chaotic systems or not .",
    "we led by intuition tend to believe that the quantum ergodic theorem and h - theorem should hold for quantum chaotic systems .",
    "von neumann believed that his theorems should hold when the condition ( [ condition ] ) is violated by ",
    "infrequent exceptions \"  @xcite .",
    "this belief is now confirmed by short and farrelly  @xcite . despite this progress , it is still not clear how these mathematical conditions are related to the integrability of a system . the main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the quantum ergordic theorem applies to quantum chaotic systems numerically with examples .    in this paper",
    "we study two quantum chaotic systems , the ripple billiard  @xcite and the henon - heiles system  @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulation shows that both systems will indeed dynamically relax to an equilibrium state where the overall features of the wave function no longer change . for the ripple billiard system , where the successive energy - eigenstates can be computed",
    ", the quantum ergodic inequality can be verified directly .",
    "in addition , we define entropies for pure quantum states in the spirit of von neumann as it is not clear how to compute the entropy defined for a pure quantum state by him .",
    "we find that these entropies will approach maximized values , offering another indication that the system is indeed equilibrating dynamically .",
    "we have also analyzed the properties of the equilibrium state reached after the dynamical relaxation in quantum chaotic systems .",
    "we find an interesting correspondence between the quantum equilibrium state and the classical micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "we discuss the underlying mechanism with the correspondence between the quantum and the classical liouville equations . at the end , we consider the statistical properties of fluctuations in quantum chaotic systems and find a distinction between the distributions of quantum fluctuations and the classical fluctuations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "we introduce the two quantum chaotic systems , ripple billiard and henon - heiles system . in section",
    "we study the dynamical equilibration of quantum chaotic systems . in section",
    "we numerically verify the quantum ergodic theorem in the ripple billiard system . in section",
    "we discuss the quantum - classical correspondence for the equilibrium states in detail . in section",
    "we discuss the fluctuation properties of the quantum systems and their corresponding classical systems . finally in section",
    "we discuss the implications for many - body cases and summarize our results .",
    "we focus on single particle quantum chaotic systems .",
    "there are two main reasons for this choice .",
    "first , single particle quantum systems are much less challenging numerically and easier to analyze .",
    "second , according to random matrix theory , the statistics of energy level spacings of quantum chaotic systems only depends on the type of matrix of the system when its hamiltonian is expressed in an orthonormal basis  @xcite .",
    "this property has nothing to do with whether the system is single particle or many body .",
    "according to the condition ( [ condition ] ) , the property of the eigen - energy spectrum is the most important factor determining whether the quantum system will equilibrate or not .",
    "there are properties that exist only in many - body systems , for example , the correlations  @xcite .",
    "so far , no one has shown that the correlation plays any essential role in the equilibration process .",
    "we also emphasize that we here consider isolated quantum systems and do not consider the dynamics of quantum systems under external driving  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a classical system will behave very differently under different drivings .",
    "this feature seems to be shared by quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "a single particle in a two - dimensional chaotic potential is described by the hamiltonian h = p^2/2m+v(x , y ) .",
    "we choose the henon - heiles potential  @xcite and the ripple billiard  @xcite as two examples for our study .",
    "the henon - heiles potential is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the energy contour of henon - heiles potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ contourh ] ; it has four special points : one stable point o@xmath7 , three saddle points a@xmath8 , b@xmath9 , c@xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "the classical orbits in the henon - heiles potential are chaotic when the energy is above @xmath12 and approach fully chaotic when the energy is close to @xmath13 with @xmath14 . for later use , we set @xmath15 .",
    "billiard systems are a two dimensional area surrounded by infinite potential walls at the edges .",
    "for the ripple billiard  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ contourr ] , the left and right edges are described by functions @xmath16 $ ] and the up and down edges are two straight lines at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the two geometrical parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 control the shape of the billiard . when @xmath21 the ripple billiard is a square with width @xmath22 .",
    "as @xmath19 increases from zero , it changes from an integrable system to a mixed , then to a fully chaotic system .",
    "it becomes mixed again when @xmath19 becomes very large .",
    "we have chosen for our computation @xmath23 , which corresponds to a fully chaotic case .",
    "the two systems are chosen because each of them has its own advantages .",
    "for the ripple billiard system , its successive eigenstates from the ground state up to the 3000th excited state can be computed numerically with great precision  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , for",
    "all other studied quantum chaotic systems , the high - energy eigenstates can only be computed selectively  @xcite .",
    "the famous henon - heiles system is chosen to bring our study beyond billiards where @xmath24 is a constant of motion , allowing us to gain more insights into general systems .",
    "in addition , we note that the henon - heiles system is beyond what is considered by von neumann and others as it has no bound eigenstates mathematically .",
    "however , its resonant states can be regarded as bound states in our numerically studies , where the dynamical evolution lasts for a finite time and hard - wall boundaries are imposed at distance  @xcite .",
    "we numerically study the wave packet dynamics with the schrdinger equation for these two systems . in our numerical simulation",
    "we set @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the initial states are highly localized moving gaussian wave packet for both systems , ( , t=0)=(-^2(-)^2)(i/ ) [ initial_condition ] with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for the henon - heiles system ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for the ripple billiard system . in both systems , a classical particle with the above initial position @xmath33 and momentum @xmath34 has a fully chaotic orbit , which we confirmed by computing the poincare section .     and",

    ", the dynamical evolution can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for the henon - heiles system , the evolution is illustrated in ref .",
    "both evolutions are very similar to each other .",
    "here is a brief description : the smooth gaussian wave packet starts to spread out and gets diffracted by the potentials ; the interference between diffracted waves begins to make the wave packet appear more and more irregular ; eventually the wave packet spreads out over the classically allowed region rather uniformly with small speckles .",
    "this overall feature will no longer change , signaling that the system has dynamically equilibrated .    to illustrate this dynamical equilibration process",
    ", we compute how the expectation of momentum changes with time for the ripple billiard system .",
    "the results for both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are shown in fig .",
    "[ momentum ] , where the momenta are seen to relax to equilibrium values after a short period of large fluctuations .",
    "equilibration should be accompanied by a maximizing entropy .",
    "von neumann was able to define an entropy for a pure quantum state and proved that this entropy will stay very close to its ensemble entropy almost all the time ( the quantum h - theorem )  @xcite .",
    "however , there appears no viable procedure which one can use to compute this version of von neumann entropy . as an alternative",
    ", we define an entropy in the spirit of von neumann , s_r=- dxdy , where @xmath41 is the long time average of @xmath42  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ entropy ] , the entropy will increase with time with small fluctuations and eventually saturate to a maximized value .",
    "the increasing entropies in fig .",
    "[ entropy ] can be regarded as a  spiritual \" illustration of von neumann s quantum h - theorem .        in summary ,",
    "we have observed numerically that dynamical equilibration indeed occurs in both the henon - heiles system and the ripple billiard : an initially localized gaussian wave packet with low entropy will dynamically evolve into a quantum state with a maximized entropy , where the wave packet spreads out and looks irregular with speckles .",
    "this is clearly consistent with both the quantum ergodic theorem and quantum h - theorem .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this kind of dynamical equilibration occurs in any quantum chaotic system .",
    "meanwhile we note that the equilibration process for the henon - heiles system deserves more detailed study in the future .",
    "as noted before , the henon - heiles system has no bound states . as a result , a gaussian wave packet will eventually leak out and spread out in the whole space , not confined to just the triangle area , beyond the tunneling time . in our numerical simulation , the equilibration time is clearly much shorter than the tunneling time",
    ". it would be very interesting to investigate in which situations where the equilibration time becomes shorter than the tunneling time .",
    "it might also be worthwhile to formulate mathematically the ergordic theorem for this kind of systems .",
    "the mathematical expression of the quantum ergodic theorem is an inequality . for an arbitrary operator @xmath43 , this inequality reads  @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 measures effectively how many energy eigenstates are occupied in the state @xmath46 .",
    "the subscript @xmath47 in @xmath48 indicates a long time averaging .",
    "we emphasize that this inequality is much stronger than the following approximation _ t(a _ ) , [ ergodic ] which can be readily proved for any quantum systems with no energy degeneracy .",
    "the above approximation can still be true even when @xmath49 fluctuate greatly from @xmath50 as long as the positive large fluctuations cancel out the negative large fluctuations .",
    "however , the fluctuations can not cancel each other in the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) ; this means that the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) dictates that the fluctuations are very small most of the time when @xmath51 .",
    "so , the approximation relation ( [ ergodic ] ) coupled with the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) shows that the long time averaging is equivalent to ensemble averaging , essence of ergodicity , in all quantum systems that satisfy the condition ( [ condition ] ) .    to test numerically the inequality ( [ ineq ] )",
    ", one needs to compute the energy eigenstates @xmath1 successively up to a high energy value and find the expansion coefficients @xmath2 .",
    "we are able to do it for the ripple billiard system .",
    "the expansion coefficients of the initial state eq . ( [ initial_condition ] ) are computed and shown in fig .",
    "[ decomposition ] , where @xmath2 s are grouped according the symmetry of the eigenstates .",
    "both groups peak around 500th eigenstates and have a width around 300 . with the computed @xmath2 s , we find that the effective dimension @xmath52 is around 300 , satisfying the condition @xmath53 .    without loss of generality , we choose to compute the left hand side ( l.h.s . ) of the inequality eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) for momentum operator @xmath54 . by using the symmetry of the eigenstates",
    ", one can readily show exactly that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the time evolution of momentum is already shown in fig .  [ momentum ] .",

    "we find that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , very close to the ensemble average @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . at the same time",
    ", we find that & & _ t + & & = _ t 0.0039 .     in the ripple billiard system for ( a )",

    "is only none zero inside the billiard , we have @xmath63 , that is , @xmath64 is effectively the largest energy in the occupied hilbert space .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ decomposition ] , the ocuppied hilbert space is roughly spanned by the eigenstates between the100th even - even(odd - even ) eigenstates and the 1000th even - even(odd - even ) eigenstates .",
    "the upper bound can be estimated as the eigenvalue of the 1000th even - even(odd - even ) eigenstates , i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "so , the relative fluctuation or the l.h.s . of eq . ( [ ineq ] ) is @xmath66 . as @xmath67",
    ", we see that the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) is clearly satisfied .",
    "moreover , our computation in fact shows that the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the inequality is about 30 times larger than the l.h.s .",
    "this indicates that it is possible to improve the inequality , for example , replacing @xmath68 with the averaged value .",
    "before we proceed further , we want to mention that the inequality for quantum ergodicity proved by von neumann  @xcite has a different upper bound on the r.h.s .. however , his theoretical formalism relies on the introduction of macroscopic operators ( such as macroscopic position and momentum ) that commute with each other .",
    "it appears not be a straightforward task to construct these macroscopic operators and compute them numerically . as a result , we did not compute von neumann s upper bound .",
    "according to the quantum ergodic theorem , the equilibrium state is described by the density matrix @xmath3 , which can be regarded as the quantum micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "we analyze this quantum equilibrium state and find that it possesses many features that resemble the classical micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "this kind of quantum - classical correspondence has been studied and found in a spin system  @xcite . to illustrate this quantum - classical correspondence",

    "we choose the following marginal distribution without loss of generality : for the real space , we integrate out the @xmath79 dimension to obtain the density distribution @xmath80 ; for the momentum space , we integrate out the angle variable to find the momentum distribution @xmath81 .",

    "[ correspondence ] , where we see the quantum and classical distributions are consistent , except for some quantum tunneling effect indicated by the non - zero value of the quantum distribution in the classically forbidden region .",
    "this correspondence also exists in phase space . in quantum mechanics",
    ", the uncertainty relation does not allow the construction of a phase space in principle .",
    "however , a kind of quasi - quantum distribution in phase space can be constructed with the husimi function @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "this is to calculate the projection of the density operator on a gaussian wave packet @xmath83 centered around position @xmath78 and momentum @xmath77 h_r.p .",
    "the husimi function can be understood as coarse grained phase space density with parameter @xmath84 controlling the coarse graining .",

    "these two time evolution equations have an identical algebraic structure , implying a possible quantum - classical correspondence in the equilibrium states .",

    "+    we emphasize here that the quantum - classical correspondence discussed so far needs to be understood in the sense of typicality  @xcite .",

    "[ classical ] .",
    "this shows that the exponential distribution of relative fluctuations is of quantum nature and absent in the classical system .    besides the difference from classical case , we note that this exponential distribution is also different from the porter - thomas distribution in eigenstates  @xcite and the result now known as the berry s conjecture  @xcite .",
    "these results are only for eigenstates , which are real up to an overall phase for systems with time reversal symmetry .",

    "superposition of numerous eigenstates is crucial .",

    "the dynamical equilibration should hold in many - body quantum chaotic systems because it is completely determined by the energy gap statistics , which is universal for all quantum chaotic systems .",
