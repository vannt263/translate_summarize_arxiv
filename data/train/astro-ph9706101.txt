    "recently , the possibility of thermally induced initial density perturbations in an inflationary cosmology was examined @xcite .",
    "it was found that for a wide parameter range within the standard inflation model , the thermal fluctuations of the scalar field can play an important and even dominant role in producing the initial perturbations .",
    "the  standard \" scenario of inflation @xcite assumes that during the inflation the cosmic expansion was dominated by the vacuum energy of a scalar field @xmath3 , and the thermalized component has never existed , or if a thermal component like radiation existed at the onset of inflation , it was blown off by the exponential expansion .",
    "the thermal component was not established or re - established until heating or reheating caused by the decay and thermalization of the @xmath3 field into relativistic particles .",
    "the thermal inflation scenario also assumes that the inflation is dominated by a scalar field @xmath3 . unlike the standard model",
    ", the thermal scenario requires that a thermalized component be established or re - established before the end of the inflation .",
    "therefore , the thermal model can be considered similar to the  standard \" model , but with a heating or reheating stage of the @xmath3-decayed particles while the inflation was still in progress .",
    "it has been realized that if the interaction of the inflation field with light particles is weak , namely , of the order of gravitational strength or slightly stronger , the thermal component can not maintain itself during the inflation .",
    "in contrast , if the interaction is strong enough to lead to thermalization , it is possible to maintain a heat bath in the epoch of inflation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the thermal scenario probably can be  installed \" onto various versions of inflation by adding a stronger interaction between the @xmath3 field and the heat bath .    in this paper , we study the properties of density fluctuations of thermal origin .",
    "these density perturbations are characterized by two thermodynamical conditions : ( 1 ) the perturbations originate in the epoch when the inflationary universe contains a thermalized heat bath ; ( 2 ) the perturbations of the inflationary scalar field are given by the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "therefore , one can expect that , like many problems of thermal physics , some features of the perturbations should be mainly determined by thermodynamical requirements , but less dependent on the details of the model , such as the inflationary potential .",
    "obviously , these features would be useful in testing the thermal scenario of perturbation production , and discriminating it from other models .",
    "up to now , the only possible way of directly testing models of the origin of cosmic inhomogeneity is to compare the predicted spectrum of the perturbations with the observed temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "therefore , we will focus on the observable features of the perturbations , including the power law index , the magnitude of the spectrum , and the behavior of the perturbations on scales larger than the hubble radius .    in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the exact and approximate solutions of the evolution of the radiation component in the thermal inflation scenario .",
    "iii gives the calculation of the features of the density perturbations produced during the thermal inflation .",
    "finally , the observational tests and possible discrimination between this model and others are discussed in sec . iv",
    "the dynamics of a universe consisting of an inflationary scalar field @xmath3 and a thermalized radiation component can be described by the following three equations@xcite .",
    "first , the equation of motion of the @xmath3 field is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the effective potential .",
    "second , the equation of the radiation component ( heat bath ) is given by the first law of thermodynamics as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy density of the thermal component .",
    "the temperature of the thermal bath can be calculated by @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the effective number of degrees of freedom at temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the friction terms of @xmath11 in eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) phenomenologically describe the interaction between @xmath3 field and the heat bath ( radiation component ) @xcite .",
    "the third equation is the hubble  constant \" @xmath12 , _",
    "i.e , _ @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the planck mass .    in the standard scenario of inflation , the radiation component",
    "is assumed to be nonexistent , or to be blown away by the exponential expansion , and the universe is cool @xmath15 during the inflation era . to establish or re - establish a radiation component , a heating or reheating epoch following the inflation",
    "is needed . however ,",
    "if the friction coefficient @xmath11 is comparable to or larger than @xmath16 , and there is strong coupling between the decay products of the scalar field , then the system of the decaying products will quickly reach thermal equilibrium . in this case , a non - zero and thermal component @xmath17 can be maintained during the inflation .",
    "one may be concerned that the friction term @xmath18 is not appropriate for describing the energy transfer via @xmath3 field particle production under far - from - equilibrium conditions .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that in some models of reheating , the first stage of the @xmath3 field decaying into other bosons is due to a parametric resonance @xcite . however , in the last stage while the thermalization is established the friction mechanism prevails .",
    "therefore , the description of @xmath11 is reasonable if there is a thermalized heat bath @xcite .",
    "briefly , thermal inflation scenario can be characterized by the following properties : + 1 . )",

    "( 2.10 ) and ( 2.11 ) .    exactly speaking",
    ", we should use a finite temperature effective potential @xmath30 in the dynamics of thermal inflation .",
    "however , for many popular potentials , the correction due to finite temperature is negligible . as an example",
    ", we consider a @xmath31 potential given by @xmath32 the slow - roll solution gives @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and the subscript @xmath35 denotes the time of the beginning of the inflation",
    ". the condition ( 2.8 ) can certainly be satisfied if @xmath36 .",
    "on the other hand , the leading temperature correction of the potential ( 2.12 ) is @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 , _ i.e , _ the influence of the finite temperature effective potential is negligible when @xmath39 .",
    "the evolution of the field in the thermal inflation scenario is about the same as in the standard model .",
    "however , the radiation component shows very different behavior in these two scenarios . in the standard model ,",
    "the radiation component did not exist before reheating , while in the thermal scenario , it appeared quite early . to illuminate this point , we first plot a typical numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) - ( 2.3 ) in fig .",
    "1 , where the potential @xmath5 is given by ( 2.12 ) and the relevant parameters are taken to be @xmath40 gev , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath9 = 100 . it should be pointed out that @xmath9-factor generally is a function of @xmath10 , and the unknown function @xmath43 will lead to uncertainty in the solutions .",
    "fortunately , the variation of @xmath9-factor has only a slight effect on the problems we are going to study .",
    "the solution shown in fig .",
    "1 is easy to understand .",
    "as expected , the inflation is dominated by the vacuum energy of the @xmath3 field , and @xmath16 remains almost constant during the inflation .",
    "the evolution of the radiation contains three phases .",
    "phase 1 covers the period during which the radiation temperature @xmath10 drops drastically due to the inflationary expansion .",
    "this phase is the same as in cool inflation models .",
    "when @xmath44 , @xmath10 will rebound , and the evolution of radiation evolves into phase 2 which lasts from @xmath45 to @xmath46 . in this phase , @xmath47 , while the radiation temperature increases due to the friction of the @xmath3 field .",
    "therefore , the second phase is actually the epoch of inflation plus reheating .",
    "finally , phase 3 begins at @xmath48 when the energy of the radiation components is comparable to the potential energy of @xmath3 field , and the inflationary process stops .",
    "the third phase is , in fact , the standard radiation dominated universe , and radiation temperature follows the standard evolution of adiabatic decreases with the expansion of the universe .    therefore , the only difference between the thermal and the standard scenarios is that the  reheating \" starts at the time @xmath49 when the inflation still prevails .",
    "in other words , the reheating stage is merged into the epoch of inflation .",
    "a specific reheating stage between the epochs of inflation and radiation dominated universe is not needed .",
    "the transition from inflation to a radiation dominated universe is now smooth , because a heat bath has already been established before the end of the inflationary expansion .",
    "moreover , the solution of phase 2 is independent of the initial conditions of the radiation and the @xmath3 field .",
    "whatever the initial condition of the radiation , the solution during phase 2 is always about the same , as shown in fig . 1 , because the radiation in phase 2 is produced during inflation , and the initial radiation has almost been consumed by the expansion . therefore , this solution of phase 2 can be installed in both initially hot and cool models .",
    "it can be used as either a reheating or heating solution .",
    "the features shown in fig .",
    "1 are typical of thermal inflation .",

    ", one can expect that the most likely value of @xmath127 given by fitting with the suppression will be smaller than that without the suppression @xcite .",
    "the result would then be moving toward the direction in favor of a tilted spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , the suppression should not dramatically change the allowed area shown in fig .",
    "4 . therefore",
    ", one may already conclude that for thermal inflation , the most likely value of the inflationary mass scale is about 10@xmath182 gev , and the regions larger than @xmath183 gev or lower than @xmath184 gev are likely to be excluded .    for a better test",
    ", we need a tri - parameter fit to find the most likely values of @xmath127 , @xmath153 , and @xmath185 .",
    "various models of the perturbation origins are difficult to distinguish in the bi - parameter @xmath127 and @xmath179 ( @xmath153 ) space .",
    "all models of the  standard \" inflation , thermal inflation , and phase transition defects , can produce the perturbation spectrum with about same bi - parameters .",
    "however , the super - hubble suppression factor @xmath185 is different for different models . in the  standard \" inflation model ,",
    "the perturbations are assumed to be adiabatic , and then @xmath181 . on the other hand ,",
    "isocurvature perturbations require @xmath186 . for models such as defects in phase transitions",
    ", causality allows no perturbations on scales larger than the hubble radius , we have @xmath186 too .",
    "the thermally originated fluctuations are neither purely adiabatic , nor purely isocurvature . because the thermal inflation ends at the time when the energy of the radiation is comparable to the @xmath3 field energy , the suppression factor @xmath185 should not be restricted to 0 or 1 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath185 is crucial to distinguish the thermal model from the others .",
