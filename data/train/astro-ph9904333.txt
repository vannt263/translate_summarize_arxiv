    "in the newtonian approximation , half of the gravitational energy is released in an extended disk during accretion onto a neutron star with a weak magnetic field .",
    "if the star rotates slowly , the other half of the energy must be released in the immediate vicinity of the star as the matter transfers from the disk onto the surface .",
    "this energy release is generally thought to occur in a narrow ( both in radius and in latitude ) boundary layer of the disk which is formed near the contact boundary between the disk and the star .",
    "the boundary layer is significant not only due to contribution to the luminosity of the compact object .",
    "it is important since the boundary - layer area is small compared to that of the disk , the layer s emission is harder and must be observed in a different spectral range relative to the disk emission .",
    "accretion onto a neutron star differs in many ways from accretion onto a white dwarf .",
    "first , the percentage of energy which is released in the boundary layer can exceed appreciably @xmath6 because of the general - relativity effects ( sunyaev and shakura 1986 ) .",
    "the boundary - layer luminosity @xmath7 is greater than the disk luminosity @xmath8 even for rapidly rotating neutron stars , but the ratio @xmath9 decreases with the increasing angular velocity of the star ( sibgatullin and sunyaev 1998 ) .",
    "second , at luminosities @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 the local flux of radiative energy which is emitted from the boundary layer is of the order of the eddington flux , i.e. , the force of radiation pressure on an electron is of the order of the gravitational force acted on a proton .",
    "there are also other dissimilarities .    most of the authors who considered disk accretion onto stars ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ; lynden - bell and pringle 1974 ; pringle and savonije 1979 ; papaloizou and stanley 1986 ; popham et al .",
    "1993 ) , white dwarfs ( tylenda 1981 ; meyer and meyer - hofmeister 1989 ; popham and narayan 1995 ) , and neutron stars ( shakura and sunyaev 1988 ; bisnovatyi - kogan 1994 ) suggest that the accreting - plasma velocity decreases from the keplerian velocity to the stellar rotation velocity through the turbulent friction between the differentially rotating layers of accreting matter within a thin boundary layer of the disk ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in this case , @xmath12 in the boundary layer , the boundary - layer meridional extent is @xmath13 and its height is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the stellar radius , @xmath16 is the boundary - layer temperature given in energy units , @xmath17 is the proton mass , and @xmath18 is the keplerian velocity at the radius @xmath15 ( shakura and sunyaev 1988 ) .",
    "the meaning of the geometrical quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 is clear from fig .",
    "1 . we see that in this approach , @xmath19 is determined by the scale height in a gravity field with a free fall acceleration @xmath21 @xmath22 the boundary - layer meridional extent , @xmath23 is given by the same formula that is used to calculate the disk thickness , i.e. , only the tangential component of the gravity force is taken into account . the thickness , @xmath24 and the meridional extent turn out to be independent of latitude and accretion rate , respectively .    in this paper , we take a completely different approach to the problem .",
    "the deceleration of rotation is considered simultaneously with the spread of accreted matter ( see figs . 2 - 4 ) . discarding popular beliefs , we assume that the deceleration of rotation due to the gripping on ( hooking , catching on ) the slowly moving dense matter beneath the underlying surface , @xmath25 is the principal friction mechanism",
    ". this gripping is due to the turbulent viscosity .",
    "this problem has much in common with the well - studied ( both theoretically and experimentally ) problem of the deceleration of a subsonic or supersonic flow above a solid surface _ ( see subsec .",
    "2.5 for a detailed discussion of the turbulence description accepted in this paper ) .",
    "_    here , we ignore the magnetic field , @xmath26 of the neutron star . as we show in subsec .",
    "4.8 , this assumption is valid for @xmath27 gauss , where @xmath7 and @xmath2 are the spread - layer luminosity and the eddington critical luminosity , respectively .",
    "in addition , when deriving the equations of motion of the accreting flow over the stellar surface , we disregard its rotation and general - relativity effects .",
    "an appreciable fraction of the x - ray bursters are neutron stars with a rotation frequency @xmath28 of the order of 300 hz see , e.g. , a review by van der klis 1998 ) . at the same time",
    ", the keplerian rotation frequency @xmath29 at the disk - star boundary in the problem under consideration is about 2000 hz .",
    "thus , the effects of stellar rotation , which are of the order of the ratio @xmath30 are small , and the computations which are performed below also yield an acceptable first approximation to the problem of accretion onto a rotating neutron star .      the most important points ( i - iv ) that pertain to our comparison of the approaches are listed below    \\(i ) let s consider the relationship between the radial ( inflow to the star , @xmath31 and meridional @xmath32 velocities . the meridional velocity is commonly ignored @xmath33 the one - dimensional @xmath34 approach to the accreting disk also extends to the boundary layer . in any case , @xmath35 is generally omitted from the equations .",
    "the boundary layer turns out to be an extension of the disk in the sense that the @xmath36 description of the disk @xmath37 also applies to the boundary layer .",
    "the disk thickness @xmath38 passes through a minimum near the neck ( see fig .",
    "after the neck , the flow broadens as it approaches the stellar surface and digs itself into the star .",
    "meanwhile , a flow with an approximately @xmath36 disk , with a @xmath39 region of a sharp turn of the flow near the neck , and with an approximately @xmath36 ( hydraulic ) spread of the boundary layer over the neutron - star surface seems more natural ( see figs . 1 , 3 , 4 and subsec . 2.1 ) . in this case , @xmath40 in the boundary layer .",
    "we specify inflow conditions at the interface between the boundary layer and the @xmath39 region when calculating the former , because we do not consider here an exact @xmath39 problem of the flow in the intermediate zone . in this formulation",
    ", it would be more correct to talk not about the _ boundary layer of the disk _ but about the _ spread layer . _ the dynamics of the latter bears no relation to the disk . here",
    ", the problem of the deceleration and spread of the rapidly rotating matter arises .",
    "\\(ii ) we consider the deceleration of rotation and the structure of isolines of rotation velocity @xmath41 in the standard and proposed approaches , we have @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the boundary layer , respectively .",
    "the lines of constant @xmath44 ( isolines ) are perpendicular to the equatorial plane in the standard model and perpendicular to the surface @xmath45 in the proposed model . in both cases , the rotation is keplerian in the disk at @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the neck radius .",
    "the @xmath44 isolines are indicated in fig .",
    "3a by the dots .",
    "they are roughly perpendicular to the surface @xmath45 inside the boundary layer .",
    "the isolines make a sharp turn near @xmath45 and then run in a dense bundle beside @xmath45 for a star at rest .",
    "this implies that the rotation velocity @xmath48 abruptly decreases near the interface between the spread layer and the underlying surface .",
    "the deceleration near the surface @xmath45 is discussed in subsec .",
    "\\(iii ) in the standard models , the boundary layer and main energy release concentrate near the equator ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the proposed model ,",
    "the width @xmath49 of the rotating belt is variable .",
    "it increases with increasing accretion rate , @xmath50 as @xmath51 the rotation extends to the entire stellar surface : @xmath52 calculations show that the spread - layer luminosity which corresponds to this accretion rate is @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 is the keplerian velocity at the stellar surface , @xmath58 g/@xmath59 defines a column of matter with a unit optical depth for thomson scattering , @xmath17 is the proton mass ( the plasma is assumed to be hydrogenic ) , @xmath60 is the thomson scattering cross section , and @xmath61 km ) .",
    "below , we talk only about the spread - layer luminosity at the stellar surface normalized to the critical eddington luminosity . clearly , the accretion disk makes a comparable contribution to the system s total luminosity .",
    "\\(iv ) we consider the latitude dependence of the intensity of radiation @xmath62 from the belt . in the standart approach ,",
    "the function @xmath63 has a maximum on the equator . in the approach under discussion",
    ", @xmath63 turns out to have a minimum at @xmath64 moreover , @xmath65 the distribution of @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "3c ) resembles the letter m , if the plot is complemented with the half which is symmetric around the equator .",
    "the problem of the spread of rapidly rotating accreting matter over a neutron - star surface has several important features .",
    "\\(i ) the centrifugal force which acts on the accreting matter in the vicinity of the equator essentially offsets the gravitation , because the accreting matter in this vicinity has a velocity that is approximately equal to the keplerian velocity . as one recedes toward the pole , the centrifugal force decreases due to the deceleration of rotation .",
    "\\(ii ) in the radiating belt , the radiation pressure works against the difference between the gravitational component and the normal component of the centrifugal force . because of the rapid rotation , the local eddington luminosity at which the radiation - pressure force equals the pressing force is appreciably lower than the luminosity @xmath66 calculated from the standard formula ( 1.1 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the dissipation of rotational kinetic energy causes a strong energy release near the lower boundary of the spread layer . as a result , powerful radiation , which diffuses through the spreading plasma and forms the observed spectrum ,",
    "is produced in this sublayer .",
    "the normal component of the gradient in the radiation pressure ( or the normal component of the radiation - pressure force ) is opposite the direction of the gravitational force .",
    "its direction coincides with the direction of the normal component of the centrifugal force . within the layer ,",
    "the normal component of the radiation - pressure gradient ( together with the centrifugal force ) decreases the free fall acceleration , decreases the density of the matter in the layer , and increases its thickness .",
    "an important point is that the increase in the height of the column ( in the spread - layer thickness ) and the drop in the plasma density cause the efficiency of the turbulent friction of the layer against the stellar surface to decrease . as a result ,",
    "the deceleration of keplerian rotation occurs on larger meridional scales than that for a small radiation - pressure force .",
    "\\(iv ) the numerical solution of the equations of radiation hydrodynamics , which is presented below , gives the following picture .",
    "the local radiative flux , @xmath67 at the equator is much lower than the eddington critical value ( 1.1 ) .",
    "this is attributable to the action of the centrifugal force and to the fact that the rotation velocity @xmath44 near the equator is close to the keplerian velocity .",
    "a ring zone in which the energy release increases due to the decrease in the centrifugal force is formed at a distance from the equator along the meridian .",
    "up to @xmath68 of the layer luminosity is released in two such latitude rings ( see figs . 3a and 3c ) . in this case",
    ", the local flux @xmath62 never reaches the eddington limit ( 1.1 ) , because the finite rotation velocities @xmath44 are required for the energy release through friction against the underlying layers , while the allowance for the centrifugal force turns out to be important .",
    "the flux @xmath62 at maximum depends on accretion rate and accounts for @xmath69 of the limit ( 1.1 ) .",
    "\\(v ) the spreading plasma within the bright belt is radiation - dominated @xmath70 the high saturation of the radiating belt with radiation causes the speed of sound , @xmath71 in the layer , which proves to be much larger than the speed of sound in plasma without radiation , to increase significantly . as a result ,",
    "the flow rotation velocity , @xmath72 in the layer is moderately supersonic : @xmath73 the meridional spread is subsonic , which is important in choosing a friction model .",
    "if the mach numbers , @xmath74 were calculated from the plasma speed of sound alone , then the flux would be hypersonic with @xmath75 moreover , the flux in @xmath35 would be transonic .",
    "\\(vi ) at @xmath76 the velocity , @xmath72 drops virtually to zero , and the layer contracts to a thin , cold weakly radiating film ( dark layer ) , which slowly moves toward the poles .",
    "having lost the excess ( relative to the star ) angular velocity in the radiating belt , the matter becomes cold and dense .",
    "the intensity of the radiation from its surface decreases by several orders of magnitude .",
    "it moves relative to the star with a velocity that is considerably lower than the speed of sound .",
    "of course , this matter is not accumulated near the poles .",
    "there is a slow flow in which it spreads under the hot layers over the entire stellar surface .",
    "this matter forms the surface against which the radiation - dominated layer rubs .",
    "\\(vii ) if the local radiative flux were the limiting eddington flux ( 1.1 ) , the width of the radiating belt ( let us denote this width by @xmath77 to distinguish it from @xmath78 could be estimated from the energy balance @xmath79 where @xmath7 is the spread - layer luminosity . as will be seen from the analysis in the main body of this study",
    ", @xmath80 underestimates appreciably @xmath81 this is attributable to the action of the radial component of the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "as follows from the calculations which are given below , the approximate balance is @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath18 is the keplerian velocity . in @xmath86",
    "we assumed that the centrifugal force is almost completely determined by the rotation velocity , @xmath72 because the centrifugal force related to the spread velocity is small : @xmath87 the latitude dependence of rotation velocity @xmath88 is required to calculate @xmath49 using ( 1.2 ) .",
    "the approximate validity of relations ( 1.2 ) and @xmath89 is attributable to the fact that the eddington radiative flux @xmath90 in the radiating belt offsets the difference @xmath91 between the weight and the radial component of the centrifugal force with a high precision [ see below subsec . 1.3 ( i ) ] .",
    "the appearance of rings of enhanced luminosity follows precisely from this .",
    "indeed , it follows from @xmath89 that @xmath92 increases with @xmath93 because @xmath88 decreases with latitude .",
    "\\(viii ) we carried out this study in an effort to explain the observed spectra of bursters in a wide range of their luminosities .",
    "several variable sources that are x - ray bursters exhibit variations in the x - ray luminosity by hundreds of times ( see campana et al .",
    "1998a , 1998b , gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ) . the theory , which we construct here , claims to describe some of the spectral features in the light curve of a neutron star as the luminosity changes by two orders of magnitude .",
    "\\(ix ) the atmosphere under consideration is characterized by the delicate balance of three forces : gravitation , centrifugal force , and radiation - pressure force . under these conditions",
    "( just as in the atmospheres of massive hot stars ) , a strong wind which flows away from the zone of enhanced brightness is inevitably formed . as a first approximation , we assume below that this wind affects only slightly the transport characteristics of the spread layer and its optical depth .",
    "\\(x ) it follows from the qualitative estimates and the detailed calculations which are presented below ( see subsecs .",
    "4.3 and 4.5 ) that the derived solutions in the radiating belt lie near the limit of validity of the shallow - water approximation . the ratios of the effective layer thickness , @xmath94^{-1},$ ] in this region ( the derivative is calculated near the base of the spread layer ) to the stellar radius , @xmath95 are typically @xmath96    nevertheless , the hydraulic approximation ( schlichting 1965 ; chugaev 1982 ) describes satisfactorily the experimental situation at the values of @xmath97 the geometrical characteristics of the spread layer are shown in fig .",
    "the spread layer is divided into two distinctly different parts at @xmath98 the radiating belt ( r.b . ) and the dark layer ( d.l . ) .",
    "their thicknesses , @xmath99 and @xmath100 differ markedly .",
    "the thickness @xmath101 is of the order of the scale height in a gravity field with @xmath102 the slope @xmath103 is @xmath104 this slope changes only slightly inside the radiating belt ( see fig .",
    "the angle @xmath105 is very small in the dark layer .",
    "the angle @xmath105 in the radiating belt increases as the accretion rate , @xmath106 decreases . therefore flows with low @xmath107 are described worse by the @xmath36 approximation . in figs . 5a and 5b , profiles 1 - 4 refer to the different values of @xmath50 profiles 1 - 4 from fig .",
    "5a are repeated in fig .",
    "5b on a logarithmic scale .",
    "this is necessary because the dark - layer thickness , @xmath100 is so small that it can not be compared with the radiating - belt thickness @xmath99 on a linear scale .",
    "in addition , the flow separation into two characteristic regions is more clearly seen in fig .",
    "the latitude @xmath49 corresponds to the thin transition zone of a rapid change in thickness . in turn",
    ", the linear coordinates in fig .",
    "5a are required to show the shape of the radiating belt .",
    "\\(xi ) the flows in the disk and in the spread layer are closely related .",
    "the accreting flow is furnished through the disk , while irradiation of the disk from the stellar surface affects its characteristics .",
    "this issue is analyzed in subsec .",
    "2.1 , where the disk thickness in the zone of its contact with the spread layer is estimated .",
    "\\(xii ) in a radiation - dominated layer , the hydrodynamic meridional transfer of radiative enthalpy toward the poles plays a major role .",
    "this enthalpy per unit mass is of the order of the gravitational energy @xmath108      we derive the system of equations of radiation hydrodynamics that describes the deceleration of rotation of the accreting matter and its meridional spread .",
    "the derivation is based on the assumption that thomson scattering contributes mainly to the opacity and that the energy release concentrates in a relatively thin sublayer at the base of the spread flow . the derived equations _",
    "differ markedly _ from the standard shallow - water equations . a qualitative analysis of the derived system of equations and their solutions ( sec .",

    "it is important to set out the procedure for the solution , because if this procedure is clear the results can be reproduced .",
    "we thus would like to draw the reader s attention to the following subsections : ( i ) smallness of the coefficients , rigidity of the system , steep and gentle segments ( subsec .",

    "the acceleration @xmath675\\ , g_0 $ ] in a differentially rotating radiating belt is smaller than that in the dark region .",
    "consequently , the weight @xmath676 of the spreading layer per unit area is larger in the dark region ; the pressure of the spreading layer on the underlying layers is also higher .",
    "we ignore the motion in the underlying layer beneath the surface @xmath238 since the motion in this layer is strongly subsonic , the hydrostatic contribution to the pressure is more important than the dynamical contribution .",
    "because of the difference in pressure on the surface @xmath45 from the spreading layer under the radiating region , this surface rises to form a pedestal .",
    "let @xmath677 where @xmath678 is the radius of this surface .",

    "in addition , the radiating belt is considerably hotter with @xmath688 ( see subsec .",
    "2.1 ) . as noted above , the radiating belt heated up the underlying layers , causing the pedestal height to increase by @xmath689    let us compare the height @xmath690 with the thickness @xmath691 of the spreading layer , ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "we see that the thickness of the spreading flow in the radiating belt is much larger than the pedestal height .",
    "this is because @xmath503 and @xmath680 differ .",
    "consequently , the relief of the surface @xmath45 is not important for the flow in the radiating belt .    at the same time , the height @xmath692 is of the order of the thickness of the spreading dark layer , implying that the dark flow can not affect the flow in the radiating belt .",
    "the flow in the belt must therefore be transcritical .",

    "accordingly , the weight contribution @xmath703 to the pedestal vanishes , and only the temperature contribution @xmath704 remains .",
    "note the possibility of subsonic circulation under @xmath45 not only due to the viscous entrainment ( gripping ) by the high - velocity layer ( see subsecs . 1 and 2.1 ) but also due to the difference in the heights of equal pressure . in the earth s atmosphere , this leads to trade - wind circulation which is attributable to solar heating of the equatorial zone ( palmen and newton 1969 ; bubnov and golitsyn 1995 ) .",

    "note also that the allowance for the moderate penetrability of the surface @xmath45 under the radiating and rotating belt results in certain quantitative changes , although qualitative conclusions remain valid .",
    "this can be seen from the results ( see below ) on the effect of variations in the accretion rate @xmath107 on the belt structure .",
    "since the intensity of radiation cooling can not exceed the eddington limit , the area of the emitting surface must be large enough to remove the released heat [ see ( 1.1 ) , ( 1.1) , ( 1.2 ) , ( 1.2) ] .",
    "the system under study has excess energy , if the emitting area is larger than the area of the disk base .",

    "the maximum is appreciably lower than unity , because where @xmath738 the subtraction of the centrifugal component is significant and where @xmath490 is small , there is nothing to radiate .",
