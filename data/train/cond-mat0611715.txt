    "the discovery of the dna double - helical structure , some 50 years ago , motivated the elaboration of the helix - coil model to account for the separation of the two strands , on physical bases @xcite .",
    "the importance of this model from the biological point of view is obvious , since processing of the genetic information involves precisely the separation of the strands . of course , under physiological conditions , the opening of the double - helix is not under the effect of temperature , but the differential stabilities in dna sequences , as revealed by helix - coil analysis , could be sensed by biological effectors , such as proteins , under various types of constraints .",
    "the successful development of the helix - coil denaturation model required appropriate elaborations for the physics and the algorithmics , allowing accurate tests through comparisons with experimental data ( melting curves ) .",
    "this field , very active in the sixties and seventies , has benefited recently from a renewed interest both from the biological side , for example in the context of genomic analysis , and from the physics side , notably in relation with questions relevant to the order of the transition in the homogeneous case and the effect of sequence heterogeneity . in the light of these still debated issues , both from the theoretical and the numerical points of view , the main focus of the present work is the numerical investigation of the relevance of disorder in a realistic dna denaturation model _   la _ poland - scheraga , in which self - avoidance between loops and the rest of the chain is also taken into account . in",
    "what follows , before further detailing the particular system considered and the open questions , we first recall briefly the general background in terms of biological models , numerical methods and previous results .    _",
    "basics for dna denaturation : _ dna denaturation is an entropy driven transition , in which at some critical temperature @xmath6 the energy loss @xmath7 with the opening of base pairs is compensated by the entropic gain @xmath8 associated with the increased number of configurations accessible to the separated single strands . experimentally , it is found that @xmath6 depends on different factors , in particular the @xmath9 of the solution and the gc composition of the sequence , related to the ratio of the guanine - cytosine , gc , pairs to the adenine - thymine , at , pairs . for homogeneous sequences , for @xmath10 , typical values for @xmath6 are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively for gc and at cases .",
    "such differences reflect of course the fact that the pairing of guanine to cytosine involves three hydrogen bonds whereas that of adenine to thymine involves only two .    for a given biological sequence of length @xmath2 , here identified , following at and gc pairs , by the coupling energies @xmath13 , the denaturation transition can be followed with uv absorption .",
    "correspondingly , the fraction @xmath14 of closed base pairs , which is the order parameter of the transition in the thermodynamic limit @xmath15 , can be measured in such experiments based on differential absorptions for closed and open base pairs .",
    "the resulting curves display usually multi - stepped structures , with abrupt variations on small ( sequence - depending ) temperature ranges around @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , for a biological sequence of fixed length , the finite size order parameter @xmath14 varies from zero to one ( associated with complete denaturation ) , with a sequence - dependent behavior .",
    "accordingly , the derivative with respect to temperature , @xmath16 , displays typically a series of sharp peaks .    from the theoretical point of view , modeling dna denaturation was essentially following two main directions : 1 ) for biological applications , in relation with melting experiments ( sixties , seventies ) , sequence - dependent algorithmic elaborations for the handling of realistic physical models @xcite , concerning notably the representation of denaturation loops , and , 2 ) for the study of the underlying physics , detailed characterizations of the properties for pure systems , neglecting sequence - specificity @xcite .",
    "_ physics of dna denaturation for homogeneous sequences : _ dna denaturation is understandable in the framework of _ almost unidimensional _",
    "systems @xcite , and it is therefore associated with a peculiar kind of transition . in fact , the first models displayed no thermodynamic singularity @xcite , as they corresponded to @xmath17 ising models with only short - range ( nearest - neighbor ) interactions , with open and closed base pair states represented by an ising spin .",
    "it was subsequently shown , notably by poland and scheraga @xcite ( ps , in what follows ) , that the observed denaturation behavior can indeed be described in terms of a simple @xmath17 model , the helix - coil model , that consists of alternating regions of contiguous open base pairs ( coiled regions or _ loops _ ) and double - stranded ones ( helical _ segments _ ) . in this model",
    "the transition in the thermodynamic limit is made possible through the adoption of appropriate long - range entropic weights for the single - stranded loops .",
    "more recently , several other models have been considered and studied , using in particular more realistic potential forms between base pairs @xcite .",
    "since sharp transitions are observed experimentally , with abrupt changes in @xmath14 on small temperature ranges , it is expected that a model , accounting correctly for such results , should undergo a first order transition in the pure case .",
    "indeed , this point has been studied rather extensively recently @xcite . in particular ,",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that the transition is of first order in pure ps models in which excluded volume effects for loops are not only with themselves , but also with the rest of the chain .",
    "notably , with the probability distributions for loops with lengths @xmath18 at the critical point following a power law , @xmath19 , the transition is of first order for @xmath20 exponents larger than 2 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that in three dimensions , with the two strands described as self - avoiding walks ( saws ) , the value for the exponent is @xmath21 @xcite . in comparison , @xmath22 for random walk ( rw ) loops @xcite and @xmath23 for saw loops , with excluded volume interactions with the rest of the chain neglected @xcite .",
    "_ biological and algorithmic backgrounds for sequence - specific dna denaturations : _ the algorithmic problem was initially encountered for the implementation of sequence - specific calculations allowing notably experimental / theoretical comparisons in the study of melting curves .",
    "it seemed natural , in the beginning , to resort to transfer matrix formalisms as developed in physics because of the ising - type formulation of the problem @xcite . indeed , neglecting loop - entropy long - range effects , the calculation of the partition function for a sequence of size @xmath2 can be expressed simply as the product of @xmath2 @xmath24x@xmath24 matrices .",
    "the extension to realistic models was at first handled through extended transfer matrices , of sizes growing up to @xmath2x@xmath2 , for the proper description of interactions throughout the lengths of the sequences @xcite .",
    "because of calculation burdens associated with such matrix sizes , alternative formulations were sought for the implementation of realistic models with affordable computation times . representing the culmination of a series of developments , through some twenty years , an appropriate algorithmic solution was proposed in 1977 by fixman and freire @xcite ( ff method ) , in which calculation efficiency was not at the price of oversimplifications in the physics , but relied instead on the numerical representation of the long - range effect as a multiexponential function . in this formulation ,",
    "the time complexity for the evaluation of a complete denaturation map for a sequence of length @xmath2 is essentially proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "this reduced complexity is to be compared with the intrinsic complexity of the model scaling as @xmath25 , if we were to consider exact one - way calculations along the sequence .    in this background",
    ", no generalizations were proposed for the ideas in the ff for a long period of time , possibly because of the formulation of this method in the prolongation of an algorithm by poland @xcite , expressed in the rather specialized context of conditional probabilities recursions specific to the linear dna helix - coil model . as a matter of fact",
    ", the only applications of the ff concerned the implementation of the algorithms in computer programs , for dna melting calculations ( such as in the poland @xcite or in the meltsim programs @xcite ) .",
    "however , upon revisiting the original derivations , it appears that the idea associated with the multiexponential representation , relying on the fundamental property of exponential function , corresponds to a powerful concept amenable to many generalizations for realistic models with long - range effects .",
    "accordingly , based on explicit partition function calculations , the simex ( simulations with exponentials ) method was first derived as a reformulation of the ff for the linear helix - coil model @xcite , with further generalizations to higher - order models involving several , mutually coupled , long - range effects @xcite . for such systems , with two or more long - ranges , the reductions of complexities by several orders of magnitudes can be associated with calculation times reduced by million folds .",
    "the basic concepts for higher - order models were originally illustrated with a circular dna helix - coil model - problem involving two long - range contributions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding principles were further transposed to a linear helix - coil model with non - symmetrical loops @xcite .    on the experimental side ,",
    "linear helix - coil models were successfully compared with experimental denaturation curves @xcite . in the beginning ,",
    "one of the motivations in the elaboration of dna denaturation models was to ask the question of possible relations between genetics ( coding / non - coding ) and physical ( helix / coil ) segmentations , because of the importance of the separation of the two strands in the processing of the genetic information . with little genomic sequences available at the end of the seventies and",
    "beginning of eighties , no clearcut conclusions were reached for such relations . more recently , with the availability of complete genomes , it was possible to resume such investigations on much larger bases , demonstrating variable correspondences between the two types of segmentations , depending on the genomes @xcite . for genomes with very sharp correlations it was even possible to propose _ ab initio _ gene identification methods purely on physical bases @xcite .",
    "_ physics of dna denaturation with disorder : _ on the physical side , dna denaturation models are associated with important open questions such as , notably , the relevance of sequence - heterogeneity for the thermodynamic limit behavior . at the beginning of the seventies , it was noted by poland and scheraga @xcite that `` sequence heterogeneity dramatically broadens the transition '' , but it is only recently that such problem has been addressed on more rigorous bases and the transition in disordered ps models with @xmath26 was also investigated @xcite . indeed , in the homogeneous case , such systems exhibit peculiar first order transitions characterized by a diverging correlation length , and it is therefore not clear to which extent general theoretical results on the effect of disorder @xcite can be applied .",
    "the question has been addressed both with analytical @xcite and numerical approaches , with either off - lattice @xcite or on - lattice @xcite implementations in this latter case .",
    "it appears however hard to reconcile these various results .",
    "the off - lattice studies of @xcite , involving very large chain lengths , suggest a peculiar transition , of first order as in the pure case but not obeying usual finite size scaling and exhibiting two different correlation length exponents , associated respectively with _ typical _ and _ average _ quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "the monte carlo like numerical simulations in @xcite , limited to small chain lengths , agree with a second order transition in the presence of disorder , though it was not possible to rule out completely a transition still of first order .",
    "finally , from the analytical standpoint , under quite general hypotheses encompassing ps models with @xmath26 , it was shown that the transition is expected to be at least of second order and possibly smoother @xcite .    in the background",
    "above , in addition to their relevance to experimental dna denaturation , ps models with sequence heterogeneity represent interesting toy - models for addressing general open questions relative to the proprieties of random fixed points .",
    "the detailed study of such systems could also help elaborating the correct approaches to be used in the interpretation of data on disordered models . in this direction , we perform here a numerical analysis of a disordered ps model with @xmath0 .",
    "relying on appropriate algorithmic formulations ( simex ) we consider long sequences . with the definition adopted for the model , and the choices for the parameter values ,",
    "the calculations are made directly comparable with previous on - lattice results @xcite .",
    "in addition , the observed behavior should be also related to that found in the previous off - lattice studies of a different disordered ps model with @xmath0 @xcite , in which the same multiexponential representation for the long - range loop entropy law was adopted .",
    "our findings show the existence of very strong corrections to scaling .",
    "moreover it appears that , for a given size , the effect of disorder is qualitatively described by an appropriately defined _ intrinsic _ length scale @xmath1 depending on model parameters .",
    "these observations provide a possible explanation for the discrepancies between previous results @xcite , as well as for an apparent dependence of the evaluated critical exponents on model parameters noted in @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the frame of the picture proposed here , the size at which the effect of disorder becomes evident could diverge exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , for the value @xmath3 chosen for the present detailed study , it is possible to observe a crossover between a nearly _ pure system like _ behavior , consistent with the one observed in simulations @xcite , and the apparent asymptotic one . with corrections to scaling taken into account , the model clearly displays a smooth transition , corresponding to a value for the correlation length exponent @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , since our results refer to average quantities , they do not rule out the possibility suggested in @xcite of a transition governed by two different correlation lengths .",
    "the analysis for the clarification of this point is left for a forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "pure ps models for dna denaturation are described in a rather extensive literature , and in particular the ingredients which make the transition of first order are discussed in several recent works @xcite . here",
    "we will only recall results for linear ps models with symmetric loops , in which one fully takes into account self - avoidance through an appropriate choice of the loop length distribution probability exponent @xmath20 .",
    "the position of a base pair along the sequence is labeled by @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and its configurational state is represented by @xmath29 , with @xmath30 for a closed pair and @xmath31 for an open pair . in the corresponding on - lattice representation",
    ", the two strands in the model can be visualized as two interacting rws with the same origin in @xmath32 dimensions .",
    "a pair is in the closed state if and only if the two bases are in the same position @xmath27 along the two strands and occupy the same lattice point @xcite ( rw - dna ) .",
    "one can write the canonical partition function for the system in the form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of configurations with the same total energy @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the inverse temperature , taking boltzmann constant @xmath37 for simplicity .",
    "the contribution of a single base pair in the closed state to the total energy @xmath35 is @xmath38 , independent from the position @xmath27 in the pure case .",
    "the number of configurations of a closed segment of length @xmath39 increases as @xmath40 and therefore its contribution to the total entropy @xmath41 is @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is a parameter of the model , interpretable as the on - lattice connectivity constant ( @xmath44 for @xmath32-dimensional rws on a cubic lattice ) .",
    "a denatured region of length @xmath18 is associated with a single - stranded loop of length @xmath45 , and the corresponding number of configurations is given by @xmath46 .",
    "the factor @xmath47 takes into account the fact that the two separated chains have to meet again at some distant point , and the relation @xmath48 holds for @xmath32-dimensional rws .    assuming that the first and the last base pairs are always coupled , a given configuration of the system is described by the lengths of the closed segments @xmath49 and by those of the denatured loops @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "its energy is @xmath52 , only depending on @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , in the partition function , the degeneracy factor @xmath34 includes both the entropic contribution of segments @xmath54 and that of loops @xmath55 , the latter being to be summed over all the possible sets @xmath56 associated with a given total length @xmath57 .",
    "correspondingly , the partition function can be also written as : @xmath58 it can be noted that the factor @xmath59 contributes an additive constant to the entropy and it is therefore not relevant for the description of the thermodynamics of the system . in what follows ,",
    "we study properties of @xmath60 .",
    "accordingly , the number of loops of length @xmath61 is taken equal to @xmath62 and a negative contribution to the entropy @xmath63 is associated to each base pair in the closed state .",
    "it is seen qualitatively that the possible change in the thermodynamic limit behavior occurs at the temperature for which @xmath64 . from the last expression in ( [ zn ] ) it is moreover clear that , in the computation of the grand canonical partition function @xmath65 , the contributions of helical segments and loops are decoupled and one obtains a geometric series @xcite : @xmath66 \\left [ \\sum_{l=2}^{\\infty }   { \\frac{z^l}{(2l)^{c_p}}}\\right ] \\right \\}^\\rho = \\frac{{\\cal z}_{s}{\\cal z}_{l } } { 1-{\\cal z}_{s } { \\cal z}_{l}},\\ ] ] where we introduced the fugacity @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 refer to the _ segment _ ( helical ) and _ loop _ ( coil ) grand partition functions respectively : @xmath70",
    "since the behavior for @xmath15 is dictated by the fugacity value @xmath71 corresponding to the pole nearest to the origin , the system undergoes a phase transition when a critical temperature @xmath6 is found below which the zero of the denominator becomes smaller than the smallest pole of the numerator . the possibility of the transition and its order both depend on the value of the exponent @xmath20 @xcite . in detail",
    ", for @xmath72 there is no thermodynamic singularity , whereas for @xmath73 the following situations must be distinguished : a smooth transition for @xmath74 with a specific heat exponent @xmath75 , a second order transition for @xmath76 and finally a first order transition for @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , these distinctions can be understood considering the properties of @xmath69 , _",
    "i.e. _ those of the distribution probability of the loop length at the ( possible ) critical point @xmath78 : @xmath79 in the case @xmath80 , the mean length @xmath81 for loops at the critical point diverges and the system exhibits large coiled regions , in which most of the bases are involved . on the contrary , for @xmath26 ,",
    "the mean loop length at @xmath6 is finite and correspondingly it is possible to show that the density of closed base pairs @xmath82 , and therefore the energy density , varies abruptly in the thermodynamic limit , from the value zero at high temperatures to a finite value at @xmath6 . in detail ,",
    "when approaching the critical point from the low temperature ( helical ) phase , one finds @xcite : @xmath83 for example , the rw - dna model in three dimensions exhibits a second order transition with @xmath84 , since @xmath22 , whereas in five dimensions it undergoes a first order transition , since @xmath85 , as confirmed both by exact computations of thermodynamic quantities and by on - lattice numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "all interactions between different loops and helical segments are neglected in classical calculations of the grand canonical partition functions for helix - coil models .",
    "it is possible to account for self - avoidance of each loop with itself through the appropriate choice of the exponent @xmath23 @xcite , corresponding roughly to the value adopted usually for comparisons with experimental data @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was demonstrated that self - avoidance of the loops with the rest of the chain can be also taken into account , and that intriguingly the pure ps models exhibit first order transitions in this case @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath20 , corresponding to a self - avoiding loop embedded in a self - avoiding chain , can be predicted from conformal theory results @xcite , and in particular it was found that @xmath21 in three dimensions , the transition being of first order also in @xmath86 .",
    "it is notable that such determination provides the appropriate value of @xmath20 to be used as an _ input _ in off - lattice calculations .    in the monte carlo like simulations ,",
    "one studies an on - lattice model ( saw - dna ) in which self - avoidance is completely taken into account , by considering two interacting saws , with two monomers allowed to occupy the same lattice point if and only if their positions along the two chains are identical , thus representing complementary base pairs @xcite . in the pure @xmath87 case",
    ", it was found that this system exhibits a first order transition , with the maximum of the specific heat diverging linearly with the chain length .",
    "it was subsequently shown @xcite that the value of the exponent describing the probability distribution for the loop lengths at the critical point is in perfect agreement with the theoretical prediction , @xmath88 . an off - lattice pure ps model with @xmath0",
    "was also studied numerically @xcite , finding the same scaling behavior than in @xmath87 saw - dna , apart from the strong finite size corrections which appear to be more important in the on - lattice situation .",
    "even though of first order , the transition is characterized by a diverging correlation length , which can be identified from the behavior of @xmath89 @xcite : @xmath90 with @xmath91 where @xmath92 for @xmath26 and @xmath93 for second order ( or smoother ) transitions .",
    "it can also be predicted that the free energy density @xmath94 takes the value zero in the high temperature phase and that it behaves proportionally to @xmath95 for @xmath96 , leading again to the behavior of the energy density and of the order parameter for different @xmath20 values given in ( [ orpa ] ) .",
    "therefore , the hyperscaling relation @xmath97 is clearly fulfilled , both for @xmath80 and for the first order ( @xmath98 ) case .",
    "disorder is introduced to account for sequence - heterogeneity , with parameter values depending on the chemical nature of base pairs ( at or gc ) at a given position along a sequence .",
    "there are a few studies on the effect of disorder on general properties of dna denaturation models in which self - avoidance is neglected @xcite .",
    "previous numerical works on disordered models _  la _ ps was mainly for comparison of the predictions with experimental data and genetic signals @xcite and for the study of the effect of base pair mismatches @xcite , where one usually takes also into account the stacking contributions , with the coupling energies depending on the chemical nature of base pairs at positions @xmath27 and @xmath99 . for comparisons with experimental melting curves , it is moreover necessary to take into account the possibility for complete dissociation of the two strands in the molecule @xcite .",
    "we also notice that biological sequences exhibit long - range correlations and strong variability in gc compositions , both according to genomes and within chromosomes . letting aside for the present such sophistication",
    ", we sum up some recent results for simple disordered models _  la _ ps with self - avoidance , such as those considered in off - lattice @xcite and on - lattice @xcite studies , which allow nevertheless to capture essential features of the effect of disorder .    in these various works",
    ", disorder enters only through the position dependent contribution of a closed base pair to the total energy . in detail , the @xmath100 are quenched random variables distributed following a binomial probability , corresponding to gc composition equal to 1/2 : @xmath101 , \\label{peps}\\ ] ] with @xmath102 .",
    "one is interested in the thermodynamic properties of the quenched free energy density : @xmath103 where , as usual , @xmath104 denotes the average over disorder and @xmath105 is a self - averaging quantity in these models @xcite .    generally speaking it",
    "is known , from the theoretical point of view , that disorder can modify very significantly the fixed point of a system , and therefore its critical exponents . in",
    "what follows , the notations with subscripts @xmath106 and @xmath107 refer to the ( possibly different ) _ pure _ and _ random _ system fixed points , respectively .",
    "a series of results @xcite , and notably the well known harris criterion @xcite , demonstrate that disorder is relevant as soon as the specific heat exponent fulfills the condition @xmath108 .",
    "correspondingly , in the presence of disorder , the transition becomes smoother and it is in particular expected that @xmath109 , _",
    "i.e. _ , from the hyperscaling relation , a correlation length exponent @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "it is however important to stress that these results are obtained essentially for magnetic systems and it is not clear to which extent they are relevant to the case here considered , concerning interacting polymers undergoing a first order transition characterized by a diverging correlation length .",
    "an analysis in terms of pseudo - critical temperatures @xcite was applied recently to disordered ps models with different @xmath20 values @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "an appropriate sample - dependent @xmath111 was defined and measured , looking in particular at the associated probability distribution .",
    "the results point towards irrelevance of disorder for @xmath22 , corresponding to the marginal case @xmath84 . on the contrary , relevance of disorder was found for @xmath112 .",
    "importantly , peculiar behavior was observed for the value @xmath0 , whereas the situation appears to be clear for @xmath113 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath113 , compatible estimates for @xmath114 were obtained from the scaling of the average pseudo - critical temperature @xmath115 and from that of ( the square root of ) its fluctuations @xmath116 . in the case",
    "@xmath0 , instead , a scaling of the average critical temperature @xmath117 was reported , suggesting a still first order transition with exponent @xmath118 .",
    "however it was also found a scaling for the fluctuations following @xmath119 , which was associated to a different exponent @xmath120 .",
    "it was then suggested @xcite that these observations are compatible with a system still exhibiting a first order transition but in which scaling laws are no more fulfilled , characterized by two different correlation lengths : a _ typical _ one , @xmath121 , describing the behavior of a typical sample in the thermodynamic limit , with @xmath118 , and an _ average _ one , @xmath122 , describing the behavior of average quantities , dominated by rare fluctuations , with @xmath123 .",
    "the resulting two - sided scenario is therefore that disorder is irrelevant to the typical sample and , in the same time , the obtainment of the @xmath124 value is in agreement with the theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "by contrast , usual finite size scaling analysis of monte carlo like simulations results on a @xmath87 disordered saw - dna model ( dsaw - dna ) @xcite , suggested a transition governed by an ( average ) correlation length exponent @xmath125 .",
    "however , in this study , average energy curves were observed to cross at the same point within the errors in the estimations , and accordingly the possibility @xmath126 could not be completely ruled out .",
    "the findings were further confirmed by the analysis of the behavior of @xmath127 at the critical point , which led to the compatible value @xmath128 when considering the largest sizes and taking into account the presence of a finite correlation length .",
    "but again , particularly with the smallest chain lengths , estimations @xmath129 , still compatible with a first order transition , were obtained .",
    "it is noticeable that the affordable sizes in monte carlo like studies are significantly smaller ( factors of order @xmath130 ) than the sequence lengths accessible to off - lattice recursive canonical partition function calculations for ps models .",
    "finally , in recent theoretical works based on a probabilistic approach @xcite , it was shown for a general class of interacting polymer models that the transition becomes at least of second order in the presence of disorder .",
    "the frame of this approach covers the ps models with @xmath112 , including the case @xmath26 with corresponding first order transition in the pure system .",
    "accordingly , these conclusions are expected to also cover the @xmath87 dsaw - dna case .",
    "following such studies , it is expected that @xmath131 both for average and typical quantities , though the possibility of different correlation lengths is not ruled out @xcite . on the other hand , according to other theoretical results in which self avoidance is neglected @xcite , disordered models _  la _ ps could undergo a definitely smoother transition , corresponding to an essential singularity in the free energy .      before presenting our numerical findings",
    ", it is worth discussing qualitative features expected , at fixed chain lengths @xmath2 , for the behavior of disordered ps models .",
    "as previously recalled , disorder should be relevant to these models as soon as @xmath112 .",
    "moreover , on general grounds , one can argue that the behavior of a system near the transition point is governed by given critical exponents which do not depend on model details .",
    "correspondingly , one would expect that both the form of @xmath132 and the precise choices for the parameters ( here @xmath133 , @xmath43 and gc composition ) should not correspond to different thermodynamic limit singularities . on the other hand ,",
    "such choices could have strong influence on finite size effects .    the disordered ps model in @xcite and",
    "the @xmath87 dsaw - dna in @xcite involve the same @xmath0 , either as a direct input for the recursive calculations or as consequence of the implementation of self - avoidance in the simulated model .",
    "nevertheless , there is a first noticeable difference between the two systems studied , as the off - lattice calculations were inspired from a wetting transition model @xcite , in which it is forbidden for two consecutive elements to be in the closed state simultaneously ( _ i.e. _ , in our notation , if @xmath30 then @xmath134 ) .",
    "also the connectivity constant @xmath43 is not the same , since it was fixed to the value @xmath135 in @xcite , whereas it is an output of the model in the on - lattice simulations , and one finds @xmath136 for saws on a @xmath87 cubic lattice .",
    "in addition , the two studies involved significantly different @xmath137 values . in @xcite the choice @xmath138 was adopted , for obtaining a critical temperature ratio @xmath139 close to the experimental value . on the other hand , in @xcite ,",
    "the value @xmath140 was studied in detail and the values @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( corresponding to the choice @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) were also considered . in the latter study , preliminary results suggested that the ( average ) correlation length exponent @xmath145 could increase with @xmath137 , ranging from @xmath146 for @xmath140 to @xmath147 for @xmath142 .    for proper understanding of these findings , and for a qualitative analysis of the expected finite size behavior",
    ", it can be important to consider in some detail the potential key role of _ rare regions _ in the generated sequences .",
    "indeed , the possible presence of such regions , of large enough size , can explain the presence of strong corrections to scaling , which could therefore depend both on model details and on the precise choice for the parameters .",
    "it can be noted that temperature and disorder appear only in the @xmath148 $ ] terms in the partition function , which are clearly invariant under the transformation @xmath149 . moreover , in the pure system , the transition occurs around the temperature @xmath150 , at which the energetic contribution for the two bound chains is of the same order than the entropic loss . in the presence of disorder , for a given sequence",
    ", it is expected to observe the multi - step behavior in @xmath14 displayed by experimental dna denaturation curves .",

    "we studied numerically a disordered ps model for dna denaturation with @xmath0 , which displays a first order transition in the homogeneous case , by solving recursively the equations for the canonical partition function with the simex scheme .",
    "the model is made as similar as possible to the @xmath87 dsaw - dna previously studied by monte carlo like simulations @xcite and it is expected that the results of the study could also be relevant to different disordered ps models with @xmath26 .",
    "we introduced the parameter @xmath245 $ ] , where @xmath133 is the ratio of the guanine - cytosine to the adenine - thymine coupling energies and @xmath43 is the connectivity constant of the corresponding on - lattice model .",
    "we showed that this parameter , at fixed @xmath20 value and gc composition ( taken to be 1/2 ) , appears to play the role of ( the logarithm of ) an _ intrinsic _ length scale , and to describe , in a first approximation , the finite size behavior .",
    "in particular , for a given @xmath2-value , the manifestation of the effect of disorder appears to be the most evident for the smallest @xmath1 values , in agreement with a qualitative explanation based on the possible occurrence of large enough _ rare regions_. it is interesting to notice that , within this picture , the system size necessary for observing the asymptotic behavior and making evident the effect of disorder diverges exponentially with @xmath1 .",

    "we found that the model exhibits strong corrections to scaling , displaying a crossing between a still nearly _ pure system like _ behavior for small chain lengths @xmath4 and the observed ( apparently asymptotic ) large one for @xmath357 .",
    "in particular , the maximum of the average specific heat , which behaves as the susceptibility , increases with @xmath2 for small chain lengths . considering the whole size range",

    "this result shows that , at least from the point of view of average quantities , the thermodynamic limit is described by a random fixed point with @xmath299 and correspondingly @xmath358 . by fitting data with a scaling law of the form @xmath359 , and by taking into account corrections to scaling ,",
    "we find in particular @xmath360 , which by using the hyperscaling relation gives @xmath323 .",

    "@xmath361 one finds @xmath2-dependent values for the exponent which is compatible with @xmath20 for the smallest sizes whereas when looking at the whole @xmath2 range it appear to converge towards an asymptotic limit @xmath341 ( possibly compatible with @xmath342 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath362 exhibits also a similar behavior , suggesting that there is no difference between _ typical _ and _ average _ correlation lengths .",
    "our best - fit estimation , @xmath323 , is close to the estimation in @xcite for the case @xmath113 .",
    "this observation would support the hypothesis that disorder is relevant as soon as @xmath112 and that the various disordered ps models considered could be described by the same random fixed point corresponding to a transition which is at least of second order ( and probably smoother ) , in agreement with recent analytical findings @xcite .",
    "our statistics do not allow nevertheless to completely rule out the possibility that @xmath363 , particularly from @xmath364 data , and in any event an analysis in terms of pseudo - critical temperatures @xcite is in order for clarifying the situation .",
    "we leave this development to a forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that there are very recent theoretical studies @xcite on the loop dynamics in ps models , which in particular relates the equilibrium loop length distribution probability to the correlation function , therefore suggesting a new intriguing method for measuring experimentally the @xmath365 value . from this point of view",
    ", the expected behavior of @xmath366 in presence of disorder and the possibility of observing differences between the average and the typical sequence cases seems to us important questions to be clarified .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results provide numerical evidence for strong finite size corrections to the asymptotic behavior of the disordered ps model considered .",
    "the data show moreover that disorder is relevant , at least from the analysis of average quantities .",
