    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are pinned down by dis data , with the slope of @xmath5 also being constrained for @xmath6 by the cdf @xmath7 rapidity asymmetry data .",
    "in fact @xmath5 is determined up to @xmath8 by the nmc @xmath9 data , _ provided _ that we assume that there are no deuterium binding corrections for @xmath10 .",
    "yang and bodek @xcite included such a binding correction and described the data with modified partons which satisfy @xmath11 as @xmath12 , whereas mrs(t ) and cteq parametrizations have @xmath13 .",
    "we repeated the global analysis , forcing @xmath11 and found an equally good fit , apart from the description of nmc @xmath9 for @xmath14 . to fit these latter ( uncorrected ) data we require @xmath13 , see also ref .",
    "we note , that as statistics improve , the hera charge - current dis data will directly constrain @xmath5 at large @xmath15 .",
    "so far the preliminary data and the mrst prediction are in agreement .",
    "@xmath16 is determined for @xmath17 by the e866 @xmath18 data , and also by the hermes data for @xmath19 .",
    "the mrst partons are in agreement with both the new e866 @xcite and hermes @xcite data .    in principle",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 dis data can determine @xmath22 and @xmath23 separately .",
    "however we use the ccfr dimuon data to determine @xmath24 . to quantify the uncertainty we obtained two new sets of mrst partons , @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath27 at @xmath28  gev@xmath29 , which embrace the spread of these data .",
    "for a heavy quark , @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) we should match , at @xmath33 , the fixed flavour number scheme , describing @xmath34 with @xmath35 , to the variable flavour number scheme with @xmath36 flavours for @xmath37 .",
    "mrst use the thorne - roberts prescription @xcite in which @xmath38 and @xmath39 are required to be continuous at @xmath40 .",
    "( cteq use an alternative , acot , prescription . )  in this way the charm distribution is generated perturbatively with the mass of the charm quark @xmath41 as the only free parameter .",
    "not surprisingly , due to the @xmath42 transition , the charm distribution mirrors the form of the gluon distribution .",
    "again , we have obtained two new mrst sets , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , corresponding to @xmath45  gev .",
    "in principle many processes are sensitive to the gluon distribution , _ but _ it is still difficult to nail down for @xmath47 where it becomes increasingly small . in this region",
    "mrst used the wa70 prompt photon data to determine the gluon .",
    "however this process suffers from scale dependence ( reflecting the higher order corrections ) , effects of intrinsic @xmath48 ( needed to describe the e706 prompt photon data ) and uncertainties due to fragmentation effects and isolation criteria . to explore an acceptable spread of gluon distributions at large @xmath15 ,",
    "mrst presented three sets ( @xmath49 , default mrst set , @xmath50 ) corresponding to average intrinsic @xmath51 and 0.64  gev respectively for the wa70 data .",
    "the arrows indicate the relative sizes of the gluons in the large @xmath15 region ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath52 needed to obtain a good description of the e706 prompt photon data is about 1  gev .    due to the uncertainties associated with prompt photon production ,",
    "the recent cteq5 analysis @xcite omits these data and instead determines the large @xmath15 behaviour of the gluon using the single jet inclusive @xmath53 distributions measured at the tevatron .",
    "the above three mrst sets of partons describe the shape of the jet @xmath53 distributions , but need to be renormalized upwards by 7% , 13% , 17% respectively to give the correct normalization , with @xmath49 being closest to cteq5 .",
    "turning now to the small @xmath15 domain , the gluon is well constrained by the observed behaviour of @xmath54 . to be precise",
    "the h1 and zeus data determine the gluon for @xmath55 , and the nmc data for @xmath56 .",
    "inspection of @xmath57 at low @xmath15 , low @xmath58 shows that the data have flattened out , indicating a smaller value of @xmath59 .",
    "also @xmath60 increases with decreasing @xmath58 , and as a consequence @xmath46 becomes valence - like for @xmath61  gev@xmath29 , which is about the lowest value of @xmath58 for a satisfactory dglap description .",
    "the total cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadroproduction are known to nnlo @xcite and the input electroweak parameters are known to high accuracy .",
    "the main uncertainty comes from the input parton distributions and , to a lesser extent , @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "for example , the results for @xmath0 production at the tevatron from the above sets of partons are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition we show the cross sections obtained from parton sets @xmath62 , @xmath63 corresponding to global analyses with @xmath64 , and from parton sets @xmath65 corresponding to global fits with the hera data renormalised up , down by 2.5% .",
    "the differences coming from @xmath25 , @xmath26 and from @xmath43 , @xmath44 are very small ( and so the predictions are not shown in fig .  1 ) , since in the evolution up",
    "to @xmath66 the transitions @xmath67 wash out the dependence on the @xmath68 input .",
    "we see that the values from all the mrst sets are within about @xmath69 of the mrst default set .",
    "the bounds are actually given by the @xmath70 and @xmath71 sets . at first sight",
    "we might anticipate these bounds would be @xmath72 since @xmath73 initiates @xmath0 production .",
    "however the difference due to using @xmath70 and @xmath71 is diluted by the evolution from @xmath58 ( hera data ) @xmath74 .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "1 the prediction obtained using cteq5hq partons .",
    "surprisingly it differs by about 8% from that of mrst . since we hope that the rate of @xmath0 production is accurately predicted at the tevatron and at the lhc , it is crucial to understand the origin of this difference .",
    "differences between the mrst and cteq partons can arise from    * the data sets included in the global fit , the @xmath75 cuts used , * the normalization of the data sets , * the treatment of heavy flavors ( massless , tr and acot schemes ) , * differences in the evolution codes .    inspection of the resulting partons show that cteq5 has , first , a larger gluon at large @xmath15 than mrst ( due to the different data fitted ) , second , a larger charm distribution , and finally a smaller @xmath5 at very large @xmath15 .    the unexpectedly large difference between the values of the @xmath0 cross section calculated from the mrst and cteq5 partons , seen in fig .  1 , appears to be due to the more rapid evolution of the sea quarks of cteq5 .",
    "a similar effect was found in a comparison of various nlo evolution codes made during the 1996 hera workshop @xcite .",
    "neither cteq , nor mrs , agreed completely with the standard code after evolution up to @xmath76  gev@xmath29 .",
    "the cteq sea was some 4% high and the mrs sea was 1% low and the gluon about 1.5% low . a careful check of the mrs code has recently revealed a small error in the nlo contribution to the evolution of the gluon . after this correction",
    "the agreement between mrs and the standard evolution code is exact .",
    "the corrected code increases the quarks in the relevant @xmath15 and @xmath58 range by typically 1% , and hence the mrst values of the @xmath0 cross section at the tevatron shown in fig .",
    "1 are increased by about 2% , so that @xmath77 a full discussion will be given in ref .",
    "at present the two major deficiencies in the parton determinations are the absence of a complete nnlo analysis and the need to determine realistic errors on the partons .",
    "this last task is especially problematic .",
    "determinations in certain @xmath78 domains often rely dominantly on one experiment .",
    "moreover we need some way to quantify the uncertainties due to @xmath48 smearing , heavy target and other nuclear corrections , higher twist cuts etc .",
    "however , as evidenced by the contributions at this conference , continued progress is being made in improving our knowledge of partons .",
