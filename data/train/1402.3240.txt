    "fu orionis stars ( fuors ) are a class of variable young stellar objects that show brightness variations of the eruptive type @xcite .",
    "the main feature observed in these variables is a sudden increase in brightness ( @xmath6mag in the optical ) , in an elapse of time of a few months .",
    "this episode is known as the `` outburst '' , after which the object remains bright for years or decades , and then fades in a few centuries back to the pre - outburst stage .",
    "the outburst , however , occurs in a different way for each fuors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these stars exhibit several indicators of youth , such as the presence of the lithium @xmath7   line in optical spectra , and the association with reflection nebulae and infrared excesses originating from dust grains in circumstellar disks .",
    "moreover , they are spatially and kinematically related to known star - forming regions and in some cases , fuors have high extinction values in the optical suggesting that they are still embedded in the parent cloud material ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fuors show several properties that strongly suggest the presence of a circumstellar disk , such as broad spectral energy distributions ( seds , @xcite ) , stellar spectral types that become progressively colder with increasing wavelength @xcite , spectral linewidths that increase with decreasing wavelength @xcite , double - peaked line profiles in high - resolution optical and near - infrared ( nir ) spectra @xcite as well as p - cygni profiles with no evidence for redshifted emission or absorption @xcite , and finally , deep , broadened infrared co bands in absorption @xcite .",
    "another class of eruptive variables are the so - called exor stars , named after ex lup , the progenitor of the class @xcite . their optical brightness increases by @xmath8mag on time scales of weeks or months , then fading back during a few months to its original state after . during its low activity stage",
    "they exhibit t  tauri - like characteristics , while during the outburst stage they usually display emission in the optical spectrum as well as in the infrared co bandheads ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to reproduce the seds of fuors , modelers use dusty disks and infalling envelopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed the presence of a circumstellar disk is essential to explain the fu orionis phenomenon .",
    "the disk is where material coming from the surrounding infalling envelope accumulates , heats - up , and finally destabilizes the structure of the disk itself , causing a thermal @xcite and/or a gravitational @xcite instability that eventually leads to the characteristic outburst .    during this episode an increase of",
    "the brightness takes place , affecting mainly the optical wavelengths since the excess emission comes from the inner regions of the disk , which are heated by the viscous dissipation released after the instability has triggered an increase in the disk accretion rate .",
    "@xcite suggests that the central objects of the fuors systems alternate between low ( @xmath9/yr ) and high ( @xmath10/yr ) mass accretion rates .",
    "the former corresponds to a low activity , quiescent state , while the latter corresponds to periods of high activity .",
    "furthermore , the transformations undergone by the disk are what cause the observed phenomenon . similarly , exor events are also attributed to thermal instabilities in the inner disks @xcite .",
    "currently , 26 fuors have been identified and classified as class  i or class  ii objects according to the shape of their seds @xcite .",
    "this includes the `` confirmed '' fuors , for which the sudden increase in brightness has been recorded , and the `` candidate '' fuors , which share many , if not all , of the properties of bona - fide fuors but for which an outburst has not been observed . in this paper we model and analyze the seds of 24 confirmed and candidate fuors to determine the physical and geometrical parameters of the star and the disk .    in section 2 we present the sample , describe the adopted model and outline the procedure used in the sed modeling . in section 3",
    "we analyze the individual sources .",
    "our results are presented in section 4 . finally in section 5",
    "we summarize the results and conclusions .",
    "our sample includes 24 of the 26 known and candidate class  i and ii fu orionis stars .",
    "the fuors cai  136 , in ngc 3372 in the carina nebula @xcite and v733  cep in the dark cloud l1216 @xcite , both identified as fuors candidates , were not included as not enough fluxes to construct the sed were available in the literature . in particular , for these objects only fluxes in the near - infrared wavelengths have been published .",
    "for some of the 24 remaining objects , only fluxes in the optical , nir and mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths are available .",
    "the lack of measurements in the far - infrared ( fir ) and sub - mm spectral regions makes it only possible to derive reliable parameters for the protostar and the inner disk , since the outer regions of the disk and the envelope emit mostly at fir and sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "table [ t : sample ] presents our sample and summarizes the main properties of each source , such as luminosity , optical extinction ( a@xmath11 ) , variation in the k band ( @xmath12k ) , year of the outburst ( if registered ) , association with molecular outflows / jets , sed class , spectral type , distance , and whether the central star is a binary .",
    "we classified the sources according to their observational properties .",
    "in particular , we used the co band at @xmath13 m to classify the objects as confirmed fuors if it appears in absorption ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or as a fuors candidate otherwise ( i.e. , if the band is in emission or absent , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the fuors in our sample were subsequently classified as class  ii visible pre - main sequence stars or as embedded class  i objects .",
    "sources with @xmath14/yr are class  ii stars surrounded by disks , whereas objects with @xmath15/yr are class  i objects embedded in infalling envelopes .",
    "this criterion is based on the best - fit values for the envelope mass accretion rates listed in table 1 from @xcite .    to construct the sed of each object we compiled all their fluxes available in the literature between @xmath16 m and @xmath17 mm .",
    "table [ t : fluxes ] lists the fluxes compiled for each object .",
    "the uncertainties for the fluxes are not always provided in the literature . in those cases we adopted `` typical '' errors .",
    "in addition we include the mir spectra published by @xcite and @xcite , when available .    the spectra published by @xcite for the sources fu  ori , v1515  cyg , v1057  cyg , bbw  76 , and v346  nor were obtained with the spitzer infrared spectrograph ( irs ) in the @xmath18 m range in december 2003 and may 2004 . @xcite published data obtained with both the spitzer and the infrared space observatory ( iso ) telescopes . in this work",
    "we include the spitzer - irs spectra for rno  1b , rno  1c , par  21 , and l1551  irs5 , observed in the @xmath19 m range between december 2003 and march 2004 . only in the case of the source re  50  n  irs1 we use the spectrum obtained with iso short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) in the @xmath20 m range , which was obtained in october 2007 .",
    "we have not included all of the iso spectra because their signal to noise ratio is low for most of the targets .      to analyze the seds we used the code developed by @xcite and the grid of models computed by @xcite .",
    "briefly , the dust radiative transfer model of @xcite reproduces a complete protostellar system comprised by a central source emitting photons and a circumstellar disk and envelope .",
    "the code uses a monte carlo radiative transfer scheme that follows photon packets emitted by the central star as they are scattered , absorbed , and re - emitted throughout the disk and envelope .",
    "the geometry of the protostellar system ( star@xmath21disk@xmath21infalling envelope ) is highly parametrized .",
    "the model has 15 modifiable parameters that can be divided into three groups .",
    "the central source parameters , i.e. , stellar mass ( m@xmath22 ) , stellar radius ( r@xmath22 ) , and stellar temperature ( t@xmath22 ) ; the infalling envelope parameters comprising the envelope mass accretion rate ( @xmath23 ) , envelope outer radius ( r@xmath24 ) , cavity density ( @xmath25 ) , cavity opening angle ( @xmath26 ) is measured from the axis of rotation at the outer radius of the envelope . ] ; and the disk parameters disk mass ( m@xmath27 ) , disk outer -or centrifugal- radius ( @xmath28 ) at the disk equatorial plane , providing an indication of the extension of the disk ( see @xcite ) .",
    "] , disk inner radius ( r@xmath29 ) , disk mass accretion rate ( @xmath30 ) , disk radial density exponent ( a ) , disk scale height exponent ( b ) , and disk fiducial scale height ( @xmath31 ) , is the scale height of the inner disk at r@xmath22 in units of r@xmath22 . ] .",
    "the ambient density surrounding the young stars ( @xmath32 ) is included as the 15th parameter .",
    "in addition to these parameters , the inclination angle to the line of sight ( @xmath33 ) is one of the most critical parameters when modeling the seds . in our analysis",
    "we adopted a value of @xmath34r@xmath22 , as it remains practically unchanged for this type of objects .",
    "we used the @xcite grid ( also called `` the sed fitting tool '' ) of young stellar object ( yso ) models to obtain an initial model for each source .",
    "@xcite used the @xcite code to compute a grid of 20,000 axisymmetric radiation transfer models of ysos at 10 viewing angles , resulting in a total of 200,000 seds in the wavelength range @xmath35 m that cover the `` typical '' range of values of physical and geometrical parameters that characterize ysos .",
    "the sed fitting tool offers the advantage that data in a wide range of wavelengths can be used simultaneously , without losing information .",
    "in addition , this tool allows the evaluation of the uniqueness or the goodness of the fit , calculating the @xmath36-per - data point value of each model in the grid , following eq .  6 in @xcite .    for each object",
    "analyzed we selected the best model from the grid of @xcite corresponding to the minimum value of @xmath36 that reproduces the sed , and at the same time , gives reasonable values for the known parameters according to previous determinations from the literature .",
    "in other words for each source we select the model with the smallest @xmath36 that provides parameter values in agreement with those already published .",
    "spectra were not used in this procedure .",
    "however in all cases the selected models reproduce the spectra well enough .",
    "these initial models were used as starting points for a detailed analysis with the @xcite code . at this step",
    "we included in the modeling the available mir spectra .",
    "the direct application of the @xcite code allows , among other things , to introduce discrete step variations in the values of the parameters . in this way a refined model ,",
    "i.e. , a fit with a better @xmath36 can be obtained , since in the @xcite grid step variations are fixed .",
    "as mentioned before , the sample we analyze consists of class  i and class  ii objects .",
    "the parameters for which a more accurate value can be obtained from the sed modeling are related to the envelope in the first case , and to the disk in the second .",
    "this is particularly relevant to characterize the fu orionis phenomenon .",
    "tables [ t : resclass2 ] and [ t : resclass1 ] list the parameters of the models that best fit the seds of the 24 analyzed objects . table [ t : resclass2 ] corresponds to class  ii fuors , and table [ t : resclass1 ] to class  i fuors . in both cases we provide as an additional parameter the envelope mass ( m@xmath37 ) .",
    "although not independent , this parameter has been determined by other authors and thus provide a direct way to compare our results with others . in the last column we give sample values for class  i and ii parameters @xcite .",
    "figures [ f : v1515cyg ] to [ f : v2775 ] show the best fit obtained in each case . uncertainties in fluxes available in the literature are indicated with error bars , except when smaller than the size of the symbols .    since fuors are variable stars , when constructing their seds we attempted to use contemporary data whenever possible .",
    "this was particularly the case in the optical and nir wavelengths , where the variations are larger .",
    "five of the analyzed objects ( v1515  cyg , v1057  cyg , l1551  irs5 , rno  1b , and v1331  cyg ) show a significant dispersion in the observed fluxes , due to the variability of the source during the period of time covered by the data . for this reason ,",
    "fluxes at different times were selected to construct individual seds . in the case of rno",
    "1b and v1331  cyg we defined two seds that were modeled independently ( figures [ f : rno1b ] and [ f : v1331cyg ] ) . on the other hand for v1515  cyg , v1057  cyg , and l1551  irs5 the identification of fluxes corresponding to different observing periods was not useful to reduce their dispersion .",
    "therefore , we chose to model the fluxes contemporary to the observed mir spectra ( figures [ f : v1515cyg ] , [ f : v1057cyg ] , and [ f : l1551 ] ) . for five of the analyzed sources ( v1647  ori , oo  ser , v2492  cyg , hbc  722 and v2775  ori ) we can clearly distinguish two epochs , before and after the outburst",
    "consequently , two seds were modeled ( figures [ f : v1647oripre ] and [ f : v1647oripost ] , [ f : ooser ] , [ f : v2492cyg ] , [ f : hbc722 ] , and [ f : v2775 ] , respectively ) . in general , fluxes from the literature were obtained with different aperture sizes .",
    "for this reason , for sources v1515  cyg , fu  ori , v1057  cyg , ar  6b , v346  nor , and re  50  n  irs we show models corresponding to different apertures ( figures [ f : v1515cyg ] , [ f : fuori ] , [ f : v1057cyg ] , [ f : ar6b ] , [ f : v364nor ] , and [ f : re50nirs1 ] , respectively ) .",
    "the outburst of v1515 cygni , one of the three prototypes of the fuor class , was detected in the optical in 1950 and it has remained in an outburst stage since then @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested the presence of a molecular outflow associated with this object ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , they argued that the inclination angle of this source to the line of sight should be close to zero , according to the shape of the large - scale nebula associated .",
    "@xcite detected v1515 cygni at 450 , 800 and 850 @xmath38 m , and the central source has an estimated luminosity between @xmath39l@xmath40 and @xmath41l@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath42co maps of v1515  cyg that shows an arc - shaped emission structure .",
    "the sed of v1515  cyg ( figure [ f : v1515cyg ] ) has two peaks , at @xmath43 m and @xmath44 m .",
    "the spitzer - irs spectrum in the @xmath18 m range shows the presence of silicate in emission at @xmath45 m @xcite .",
    "the observed fluxes from @xmath46 m to @xmath47 m show a relatively large dispersion .",
    "this is mainly caused by the difference in the time when observations were obtained , which can be seen in figure  [ f : v1515cyg ] , where the crosses correspond to the fluxes observed between 2003 and 2004 and diamonds to the observations obtained between 1983 and 1996 .",
    "the best fit for v1515  cyg ( figure  [ f : v1515cyg ] , table  [ t : resclass2 ] ) corresponds to the fluxes obtained in 2003 - 2004 ( crosses in figure [ f : v1515cyg ] ) , which are contemporaneous to the spitzer spectrum .",
    "the 1983 - 1996 data ( diamonds in figure [ f : v1515cyg ] ) have a large dispersion , which makes the modeling more difficult .",
    "we adopted the published spectral type for this source ( g2g5 , see table  [ t : sample ] in @xcite ) , which corresponds to a temperature in the @xmath48k range @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : v1515cyg ] shows our best model for two different apertures , @xmath49 ( solid line ) and @xmath50 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the latter aperture value is similar to that used in the extraction of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined an upper limit for the disk mass of v1515  cyg of @xmath51 , from observations at 1.3 mm .",
    "@xcite estimated an opening angle for the cavity @xmath52 , a disk mass accretion rate @xmath53/yr , and a disk mass m@xmath54 .",
    "@xcite modeled the nir and mir sed as well as the spitzer spectrum and derived a maximum temperature for the central source of @xmath55k , and @xmath56 .",

    "the values of @xmath67 and r@xmath68r@xmath40 listed in table [ t : resclass2 ] are in good agreement with those determined by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "bbw 76 , also known as bran 76 and iras  07486@xmath693258 was identified by @xcite as a fu orionis star .",
    "later , @xcite confirmed this identification based on high resolution optical spectra , in particular by the p - cygni balmer line profiles and absorption line widths , similar to fuors prototypes .",

    "bbw  76 is not associated with any known molecular outflow @xcite , and @xcite suggested that bbw  76 might be a class  i object .",

    "the stellar radius ( @xmath81r@xmath40 ) and the disk inner radius ( r@xmath82au ) we derive agree with the values obtained by @xcite , however our modeled disk mass ( @xmath83 ) is less than that determined by @xcite ( @xcite , m@xmath84 ) .",
    "the disk mass accretion rate is @xmath85/yr , then @xmath86 , is two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained by other authors .",

    "we caution , however , on the small number of objects in each class ( 14 confirmed and 10 candidate fuors ) .",
    "for the seven objects in our sample , for which we have seds both in the outburst and in the quiescence stage ( see tables  [ t : resclass2 ] and [ t : resclass1 ] ) , 2 class ii ( rno 1b , and v1647 ori ) , and 5 class i ( oo ser , v1313 cyg , v2492 cyg , hbc 722 , and v2775 ori ) , we note that while the disk and stellar parameters show variations , the envelope parameters ( @xmath23 , r@xmath24 , and m@xmath399 ) do not change , suggesting the outbursts are triggered by an instability after a long build - up phase .",
    "the current scenario of fuors events states that the circumstellar disk of a yso builds up material injected from the envelope until it becomes thermally @xcite and/or gravitationally @xcite unstable .",
    "in particular , using the model parameters and disk properties listed in tables  [ t : resclass2 ] and [ t : resclass1 ] we calculated the toomre @xmath400 gravitational stability parameter @xcite . if @xmath401 , the disk is unstable .",

    "nevertheless all disk are unstable well inside the centrifugal radius ( see table [ t : averages ] ) .",
    "consequently , gravitational instabilities may contribute to the outburst eruptions , in addition to thermal instabilities , resulting in an increase of the mass accretion onto the central object .",
    "what we have described so far agrees with this picture . however , the disk mass accretion rate @xmath126/yr we obtain ( see table [ t : median ] ) is one order of magnitude lower than the @xmath404/yr predicted by the theory @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , previous models of individual fuors objects obtain @xmath298 values consistent with those presented in this work ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the average values for the parameters for both groups of fuors are similar to those theoretically expected , the individual values listed for each object in tables [ t : resclass2 ] and [ t : resclass1 ] differ significantly",
    ". this can be in part attributed to the fact that the group of the fu orionis stars itself is not an homogeneous sample .",
    "while they all share a particular set of characteristics , those appear in different ways for each object .",
    "for instance , while all fuors show a sudden brightness increase of several magnitudes , followed by a slow decrease to their previous state , the way the brightness jump develops in time is different for each object . a clear example of this is the great diversity in the light curves of the three prototypes of the class @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that the values of individual parameters of each member of the group will ultimately differ .",
    "lastly , we would like to draw attention to three sources in particular .",
    "v1647  ori is a special case on the fuor sample since it has been well studied before and after the outburst , having seds for both epochs .",
    "this makes that source a prime candidate for the study of the fu orionis event , though it has to be approached with care , since its classification as a fuor or exor is still under debate @xcite .",
    "the other two particular sources are v2492  cyg and hbc  722 .",
    "these objects are , at the moment of writing , the last two for which an fuors - like outburst has been observed .",
    "they show characteristics proper of bona - fide fuors , as shown in sections  [ sec - v2492cyg ] and [ sec : hbc722 ] , however its inclusion in the fuors class is still not certain .",
    "nevertheless , our sed modeling shows behaviors similar to v1647  ori , the former newest member of the class .",
    "v1647  ori and v2492  cyg also show exor characteristics , and from our modeling we see that they do not show a large variation between the outburst and the quiescent phases .",
    "for example , their disk masses do not change with the outburst ( see tables  [ t : resclass2 ] and [ t : resclass1 ] ) , and the variation of the disk mass accretion rate is lower than for other fuors .",
    "nevertheless , when compared with other fuors , the parameter values derived for those sources are still within the range established by the rest of the fuors sample , and could then be considered fuors . however",
    ", if we had just analyzed only those two sources while taking into consideration that exor outbursts are thought to be `` scaled - down '' versions of fuors outbursts , it is very likely that they would have been considered exors .",
    "this shows the uncertainty and difficulty of disentangle the two types of outburst episodes .    despite sharing common properties , each fuors or fuors candidate has its own peculiarities that are not currently well understood .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to study the most extreme objects of the class to reach a full understanding of this period of great activity in circumstellar disks .",
    "the work we have presented here is the first compilation of seds of the currently known fuors . of the 26 currently known fuors ,",
    "2 do not have enough observations as to construct the seds , and thus are not analyzed . for 21 of the remaining 24",
    "we compile in one place the observations taken in all wavelengths , producing the most complete seds possible so far . for 3 fuors ( ar 6a , ar 6b , v2492 cyg ) , seds for only a limited range ( @xmath405 @xmath406 20 @xmath38 m ) were constructed and thus values for the derived parameters are not fully determined . finally , for 11 of the 24 fuors analyzed ( v1735 cyg , v883 ori , rno 1b , rno 1c , ar 6a , ar 6b , v900  mon , v346  nor , oo  ser , re 50 n irs 1 and hbc  722 ) we provide for the first time a complete sed modeling to determine the physical and geometrical parameters of the star@xmath21disk@xmath21envelope system .",
    "furthermore , this is the first time all the known fuors with an observed sed are modeled with the same code at the same time , providing an homogeneous set of results .",
    "the data we present here will be of great help for future studies in the field .",
