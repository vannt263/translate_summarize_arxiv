    "the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism has been studied for several decades .",
    "systems composed of alternating magnetic and superconductive layers are of interest not only because they are model systems for the interplay of competing superconducting and magnetic order parameters , but also because of numerous possible applications .",
    "recently , the development of magnetic thin film technology has triggered new interest in this field .",
    "of particular importance has been the possibility of examining the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism in high - temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "bulaevskii @xmath0 @xmath1 showed that magnetic domain structures in a magnetic film in close contact with a superconducting film may enhance pinning of vortices , since this gives an opportunity to pin the magnetic flux of the vortex rather than its core@xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the pinning of vortices in superconductor / ferromagnetic multilayers can be 100 times greater than the pinning by columnar defects .",
    "later , this proposal has been partially verified , but only in the case of a bilayer structure@xcite .",
    "another interesting proposal is that of sonin , who suggested that the magnetostatic field from a domain wall may create a weak link at which single vortices could be localized@xcite .",
    "then , by moving the domain wall , one should also be able to move the weak link as well .",
    "evidently , many interesting applications could be developed if such interactions are better understood . in the present work",
    "we examine the interaction between a magnetic domain wall and a superconductor .",
    "first we investigate the interaction between a thin magnetic film and a superconducting substrate , and estimate the equilibrium width of a bloch wall in the film",
    ". it will be shown that due to flux repulsion , the domain wall experiences a small shrinkage on cooling through the critical temperature of the superconductor .",
    "this could be exploited in magnetooptic waveguide systems . in such systems",
    "it is possible to match the interacting mode s phases using the spatial periodicity of a sequence of bloch walls@xcite .",
    "altering the width of these domain walls simply by tuning the temperature could be an effective way to change the light propagation in the waveguide .",
    "we also study the interaction between the domain wall and a single vortex in a type ii superconductor .",
    "this is of interest both in fundamental and applied physics .",
    "if we build further on the idea of sonin , it should be possible to create a memory device based on active control of generation and annihilation of vortices by means of one or more domain walls . in recent years",
    "superconducting circuits based on single - flux - quantum pulses have been shown to provide a new family of digital electronics with ultra - high speed and very low power - dissipitation . at clock rates exceeding 10 ghz and operation speed of many hundred ghz ,",
    "these devices can in the future outrun any semiconductor device@xcite .",
    "using domain walls as active vortex - gates we may add an additional degree of freedom in these devices .",
    "it is known that bismuth - substituted ferrite garnet films with in - plane magnetization have domain walls with very low coercivity that can be moved without ambiguity at frequencies up to several ghz@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in such materials bloch walls are easily formed by external magnetic fields or stress patterns , and these could be manipulated in numerous ways suitable for a memory device .",
    "consider a magnetic film of thickness @xmath2 with two domains of opposite in - plane magnetization .",
    "the domains are separated by a 180 degree bloch wall of width @xmath3 and length @xmath4 .",
    "the magnetic film is placed in contact with a type i superconductor .",
    "we assume that the superconductor has zero penetration depth so that an image of the bloch wall is formed inside the superconductor as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . here",
    "we want to estimate the equilibrium wall width with and without the superconductor . to this end",
    ", we use a linear wall model , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the angle between the magnetization vector and z - axis .",
    "contributions to the total wall energy comes from the exchange interaction , the crystalline anisotropy , the magnetostatic energy and magnetoelastic effects . here",
    "we neglect the magnetoelastic energy , which is justifiable when the wall width is small . also , if the substrate on which the magnetic film is deposited is thick , a large portion of the stress is dissipated in the substrate as well ( note that this substrate is not necessarily the superconductor , but could be some other material on which the magnetic film is deposited ) .    for a bloch wall",
    "the anisotropy energy per unit length of wall is given by , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the uniaxial anisotropy constant .",
    "the exchange energy per unit length of wall is expressed by , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the effective exchange constant .",
    "the magnetostatic energy of a bloch wall can be found by approximating the wall with a homogenously magnetized elliptic cylinder@xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the permeability of vacuum , and @xmath13 is the saturation magnetisation in the magnetic material .",
    ". [ mag ] is a reasonable approximation for materials with low permeability , and has been used to model the domain wall behaviour in ferrite garnet films ( see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ) .    in the presence of the superconducting substrate",
    "the magnetic surface charge at @xmath14 is at most doubled , which means that the energy density can not increase by more than four times . in the limit @xmath15 the energy density at @xmath16",
    "is not altered .",
    "if we now assume that the area occupied by the magnetic field is not decreased , then the average energy in presence of the superconductor is @xmath17 times that without the superconductor .",
    "this is an upper estimate of the increase in energy , since the area will change upon introduction of the superconductor , and the energy density is lower than that assumed here . to date , nobody has performed an accurate analysis of the magnetostatic energy resulting from the influence of a superconducting substrate .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect that the magnetostatic energy has a similar functional dependence of film thickness and wall width as in eq . [ mag ] , if we assume that only the width of the domain wall changes upon introduction of the superconductor .",
    "therefore we will characterize the increase in energy by a factor @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 with and @xmath21 without the superconductor .",
    "we strongly emphasize that @xmath20 is only a reasonable guess made in order to estimate an upper bound for the superconductor s influence on the wall width , and that a complete micromagnetic analysis is required to obtain a more accurate answer .",
    "such an analysis should take into account the finite penetration depth and the fact that the magnetization in the bloch wall changes in a continuos manner .    to find the equilibrium wall width ,",
    "we must minimize the total energy according to @xmath22 here we will only consider the limit @xmath15 , @xmath23 which can easily be solved numerically .    increasing the magnetization increases the effect of the superconducting substrate as well .",
    "it is seen that when the anisotropy constant can be neglected , the equilibrium wall width becomes , @xmath24 and the wall width decreases at most by @xmath25 by crossing the critical temperature of the superconductor .",
    "sonin analyzed a periodic array of domains with magnetizations perpendicular to the film , and found that in the limit @xmath26 the domain width decreases at most by @xmath27@xcite . in our case",
    "the change is probably smaller , since the contribution due to the uniaxial anisotropy is often comparable to that from the magnetization .",
    "however , when the magnetostatic energy can be neglected , the wall width is given by @xmath28 and the superconductor has no influence .    as an example we calculate the equilibrium wall width in the case of a ferrite garnet film of composition @xmath29 . in these films",
    "it is easy to obtain single bloch walls of the kind discussed here .",
    "reasonable material parameters are @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 . fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows the wall width as a function of the magnetization @xmath13 with ( @xmath20 ) and without ( @xmath21 ) the superconducting substrate .",
    "it is seen that the wall width decreases with increasing magnetization .",
    "note also that the difference between @xmath21 and @xmath20 is around 20 @xmath34 . in a magnetooptic waveguide a 20 @xmath34 change in the wall width is probably enough to alter the light propagation substantially",
    ". a larger difference can be obtained by reducing the anisotropy constant @xmath8 . in @xmath29",
    "this is often done by reducing the bi - content .",
    "consider a straight vortex located a distance @xmath35 from the bloch wall , see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . due to the magnetic field from the bloch wall",
    ", there will be an interaction between the two .",
    "we assume that the magnetic film is so thick that the magnetic poles at @xmath16 and @xmath36 do not feel the field from the vortex , and the pole strength at @xmath14 is now two times that of the domain wall alone ( if the distance @xmath35 is large and the penetration depth is small ) . to find the interaction between the vortex and the domain wall",
    ", one should in general solve the london - maxwell equations , including the contributions from supercurrents .",
    "however , here we estimate only the purely magnetostatic interaction , which means that the interaction energy can be calculated considering only the magnetostatic forces between a magnetic monopole and a magnetic surface charge , using the following integral @xmath37    it has been found that the field from a vortex is similar to that from a magnetic monopole located a distance @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the penetration depth ) below the superconductor surface@xcite . in this approximation",
    "the scalar potential can be written as , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the flux quantum .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) assumes that the medium above the superconductor is isotropic with permeability @xmath12 .",
    "an accurate calculation should take into account the anisotropy of the magnetic film .",
    "however , here we will neglect the fact that the magnetic film alters the field from the vortex , in order to get a simple estimate of the interaction energy .",
    "then the x - component of the force acting on the vortex is given by @xmath42 \\left [ -\\frac{l}{2 } + \\sqrt{(\\frac{l}{2 } ) ^{2 } + ( \\frac{w}{2 } + a)^{2 } + ( z - z_{0})^{2 } } \\right]}{\\left [ \\frac{l}{2 } + \\sqrt{(\\frac{l}{2 } ) ^{2 } + ( \\frac{w}{2 } + a)^{2 } + ( z - z_{0})^{2 } } \\right ] \\left [ -\\frac{l}{2 } + \\sqrt{(\\frac{l}{2 } ) ^{2 } + ( \\frac{w}{2 } -a)^{2 } + ( z - z_{0})^{2 } } \\right ] } \\right| \\ ,   .",
    "\\label{force}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have assumed that the magnetic charge is @xmath43 , which is strictly valid for zero penetration depth and z=0 . in the case that the magnetic wall is moved away from the superconductor ( @xmath44 ) , the magnetic charge changes , and eq .",
    "[ force ] must be regarded as a rough approximation .",
    "it must also be pointed out that the vortex is a normal state region , and is therefore expected to change the magnetic charge when it is near the bloch wall .",
    "thus the expression for @xmath45 should be regarded as an upper limit of the force between the vortex and the bloch wall , but should have the correct order of magnitude .",
    "when l is much larger than @xmath39 , @xmath3 and @xmath35 , then @xmath45 is almost independent of l. note that the interaction strength can be tuned by changing the magnetization , which could be useful in a potential memory device . to visualize the strength of the interaction for different magnetizations , fig .",
    "[ f4 ] shows the force as a function of distance when @xmath46 @xmath31 , @xmath47 @xmath33 , @xmath48 @xmath49 , @xmath50 nm , @xmath51 @xmath49 , z=0 nm , and eq . ( [ ab ] ) was used to calculate the wall thickness @xmath3 .",
    "the solid line correspond to @xmath52 @xmath53 and the dashed line to @xmath54 @xmath53 .",
    "the figure shows that by decreasing the magnetization , the force decreases as well . as expected from fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , the vortex is attracted towards the domain wall from both sides of the domain wall , and can be captured if it comes close enough .",
    "note also that the vortex is repelled if the polarity of the bloch wall is reversed .",
    "we see that the force @xmath45 is rather small .",
    "thus only if the pinning strength is small enough , the bloch wall can be used to move the vortex . to develop a memory device",
    "as discussed in the introduction , one needs carefully designed high - temperature superconductors with low pinning strength .",
    "we have studied the interaction between a magnetic thin film and a superconductor . in particular ,",
    "the equilibrium width of a bloch wall is estimated with and without a superconducting substrate .",
    "it is shown that the bloch wall experiences a @xmath55 @xmath34 shrinkage on cooling through the critical temperature of the superconductor .",
    "furthermore , the interaction between the bloch wall and a single vortex is estimated , and it is found that the domain wall is able to trap the vortex if the vortex comes close enough .",
