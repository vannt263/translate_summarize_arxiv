    "glitches in pulsars are probably the only method of studying the internal structure of neutron stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; see @xcite and @xcite for an observational perspective , and @xcite for a theoretical discussion of pulsar glitches . among pulsars that have been observed for their glitch behavior ,",
    "the crab pulsar ( psr b0531 + 21 or j0534 + 2200 ) has been the most closely studied @xcite .",
    "glitches in this pulsar occur , in average , once in @xmath2 years .",
    "its several glitches have been analyzed and results for them published by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the most recent study being that of @xcite .",
    "this work focuses on the glitch that occurred in the crab pulsar on @xmath0 august @xmath1 ( henceforth cpg2006 ) ; more precisely , on the five month duration before cpg2006 .",
    "two radio observatories observed it in sufficient detail to derive the relevant glitch parameters  the jodrell bank observatory ( @xcite ; henceforth jbo ) and the xinjiang astronomical observatory ( @xcite ; henceforth xao ) .",
    "the critical pre - glitch reference timing model is obtained by both groups by fitting a simple rotation model to the timing data for a given duration before the glitch ( the pre - glitch duration ) ; the model typically consists of the pulsar rotation frequency @xmath3  and its first two derivatives @xmath4  and @xmath5  , at the epoch of the glitch , which is mjd @xmath6 for both observatories .",
    "the pre - glitch duration for the jbo group is about 43 days starting from mjd @xmath7 ( c. espinoza , private communication ) , while that of the xao group is @xmath8 days , from mjd @xmath9 to mjd @xmath10 .",
    "the timing residuals for cpg2006 relative to the pre - glitch reference timing model are analyzed by both groups , obtaining consistent results .",
    "this work shows that a different choice of the pre - glitch duration for cpg2006 reveals what appears to be a small glitch about five months before the main glitch .",
    "the monthly radio timing data of the crab pulsar from jbo are used to derive the result , and x - ray data from the rxte observatory are used to verify it . in the last section it is argued that this is more likely to be a glitch than timing noise , although the data available strictly do not allow to discriminate between the two possibilities .",
    "the crab pulsar was monitored daily by jbo since @xmath11 , mainly at @xmath12 mhz frequency @xcite .",
    "occasionally it was also observed in the @xmath13 to @xmath14 mhz band .",
    "the xao has been monitoring the crab pulsar once a week at @xmath15 mhz since @xmath16 january @xcite .",
    "both groups estimate the arrival time of the integrated pulse profile ( ip ) of the crab pulsar , and use this data to study the several glitches in this pulsar by means of standard techniques .",
    "neither of the above two data are available in the public domain .",
    "however jbo also publishes monthly arrival times of the crab pulsar ip , referred to the solar system barycenter , and scaled to infinite frequency , in the so called jodrell bank crab pulsar monthly ephemeris ( @xcite ; henceforth jbcpme ) .",
    "data from this ephemeris spanning the epoch @xmath17 november @xmath18 to @xmath19 may @xmath18 ( mjd @xmath20 to mjd @xmath21 ) , yielding @xmath22 timing residuals , have been used for this work . in practice ,",
    "one requires daily timing residuals to properly analyze the glitches in the crab pulsar .",
    "however , jbcpme also contains very accurate @xmath3  and @xmath4  at each monthly epoch , which help in converging to a sufficiently accurate pre - glitch reference timing model .",
    "thus the monthly radio data used in this work are suitable to demonstrate the existence of the smaller glitch , which is the main goal of this work ; derivation of statistically rigorous glitch parameters requires the original daily observed data .",
    "although this work uses only the crab pulsar s timing residuals , the main result is also evident in the @xmath3  and @xmath4   listed by jbcpme , as discussed in the last section .",
    "the x - ray data used in this work were obtained from the proportional counter array ( pca ; @xcite ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; @xcite ) aboard the rxte observatory .",
    "the pca consists of five proportional counter units ( pcus ) operating in the @xmath23 to @xmath24 kev range , having a field of view of @xmath25 degree in the sky(@xmath26 ) , and a time resolution of @xmath25 micro second ( @xmath27sec ) ( see `` the abc of xte '' guide on the rxte website ) .",
    "the hexte instrument consists of two independent clusters of detectors .",
    "each cluster contains four nai(tl)/csi(na ) phoswich scintillation photon counters , and has a field of view of @xmath28 in the sky .",
    "effectively this instrument is sensitive to photons in the @xmath18 to @xmath29 kev range , and each photon s arrival time accuracy is @xmath30 @xmath27sec ( see `` the abc of xte '' guide ) . the first rxte observation used in this work",
    "was obtained on @xmath17 november @xmath31 ( mjd @xmath32 ) , and the last on @xmath19 april @xmath1 ( mjd @xmath33 ) ; the corresponding observation identification numbers ( obsid ) are @xmath34-@xmath35-@xmath36-@xmath37 and @xmath38-@xmath39-@xmath40-@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "this yielded @xmath41 pca timing residuals , but only @xmath42 hexte residuals , since there were insufficient x - ray photons in the hexte data of obsids @xmath34-@xmath35-@xmath43-@xmath37 and @xmath38-@xmath39-@xmath44-@xmath37 .",
    "the pca data was obtained in the event mode with identifier _",
    "e_@xmath45us_@xmath46m_@xmath47_@xmath25s _ , after being integrated into time intervals of @xmath48 @xmath27sec , and binned in energy into @xmath46 channels having non - uniform energy widths . in @xmath49",
    "obsids useful data was available when all @xmath50 pcus were switched on ; in @xmath51 of them when only @xmath52 pcus were switched on ; and so on .",
    "even when only @xmath25 pcu was switched on ( obsids @xmath38-@xmath35-@xmath53-@xmath37 and @xmath38-@xmath54-@xmath55-@xmath37 ) the data had sufficient number of photons to yield a statistically significant pulse profile .",
    "epoch ( mjd ) & @xmath56 + @xmath3 ( hz ) & @xmath57 + @xmath4 ( s@xmath58 ) & @xmath59 + @xmath5 ( s@xmath60 ) & @xmath61 +    the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the radio timing residuals of the crab pulsar , relative to the pre - glitch reference timing model given in table  [ tbl1 ] , during the epoch under consideration .",
    "the pre - glitch reference timing model was obtained using the first @xmath50 data in the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , in the range mjd @xmath62 to mjd @xmath63 , translating to day @xmath64 to @xmath65 in abscissa .",
    "this duration will henceforth be referred to as the pre - glitch duration ( pgd ) .",
    "the tempo@xmath23 @xcite best fit parameters of this data are shown in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the standard deviation of the five data , from the model derived by tempo@xmath23 , is tres @xmath66 @xmath27sec .",
    "however tempo@xmath23 estimates tres using @xmath50 degrees of freedom , whereas the number to use is @xmath23 , since @xmath67 parameters have been fit for . the appropriate value of standard deviation is @xmath68 @xmath27sec .    by including the next five timing residuals in the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , from mjd @xmath63 to mjd @xmath69 , or day @xmath70 to @xmath71 in abscissa , the tempo@xmath23 best fit parameters are @xmath72 hz , @xmath73 s@xmath58 , and @xmath74 s@xmath60 .",
    "the tres of these ten data is @xmath75 @xmath27sec , but the appropriate value of standard deviation is @xmath76 @xmath27sec .",
    "the two variances differ by @xmath77 , while the standard error on this difference is @xmath78 .",
    "the two variances differ by @xmath79 standard errors ; i.e. , the latter variance is significantly larger than the former at the @xmath80 confidence level .",
    "attempts made to obtain statistical fits with standard deviation less than @xmath81 @xmath27sec failed ( for example , by choosing a different reference epoch , by altering initial values of the parameters by hand , etc ) . therefore using radio data right up to mjd @xmath69 , to derive the pre - glitch reference timing model , is not justified .",
    "the reason is the small depression extending from mjd @xmath63 to mjd @xmath69 ( day @xmath70 to day @xmath71 ) in the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , which will henceforth be referred to as the small glitch duration ( sgd ) .",
    "the main glitch that follows is clearly evident in the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it starts at mjd @xmath69 and extends up to mjd @xmath82 , or day @xmath71 to @xmath83 ( henceforth referred to as the main glitch duration mgd ) , although data only up to mjd @xmath84 ( day @xmath85 ) has been shown in figure  [ fig1 ] to highlight the depression .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows a closer view of the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ; earlier what looked like a depression now looks more like a glitch .",
    "data points @xmath67 to @xmath86 in figure  [ fig2 ] ( five radio data points belonging to sgd ) have been fit to the function @xmath87 in equation @xmath25 , the fit taking into account their errors , @xmath88     @xmath89 ( @xmath90 hz ) & @xmath91 ( @xmath92 s@xmath58 ) & @xmath93 ( @xmath90 hz ) & @xmath94 ( days ) + jbcpme & @xmath95 & @xmath96 & @xmath97 & @xmath98 & @xmath99 + pca & @xmath100 & @xmath101 & @xmath102 & @xmath103 & @xmath104 + hexte & @xmath100 & @xmath105 & @xmath106 & @xmath107 & @xmath108 +    where the parameters @xmath109 ( epoch of the glitch ) , @xmath110 ( related to the permanent change in rotation frequency at the epoch of the glitch @xmath89 , @xmath111 ( related to the permanent change in rotation frequency derivative @xmath91 , @xmath112 ( related to the exponential change in rotation frequency @xmath93 ) , and @xmath113 ( decay time scale of the glitch ) are all allowed to vary during the non - linear fit ( see @xcite and @xcite for further details on equation @xmath25 ) .",
    "several equivalent fits are obtained by choosing the initial value of @xmath114 between day @xmath115 and day @xmath116 , which is the range of epoch between the last data point of pgd and the first data point of sgd ; the corresponding @xmath117 obtained are @xmath118 and @xmath119 days respectively ; larger values of @xmath114 yield smaller values of @xmath117 , as is expected .",
    "an illustrative fit , obtained using the initial value of @xmath120 ( midway between the above two numbers ) , is shown in the second row of table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "the corresponding @xmath87 is plotted as the dashed line in figure  [ fig2 ] . while the non - linear fit converged to the solution given with a standard deviation of @xmath121 @xmath27sec , fitting five data points to a function with five parameters",
    "leaves no degrees of freedom to estimate the errors on the parameters .",
    "attempts to fit the data to a modified @xmath87 , that does not contain the last ( @xmath122 and @xmath117 ) term , converge to values of @xmath114 lower than the epoch of the last data point of pgd .",
    "these are unrealistic solutions , since the first residual after a glitch must have more negative value than that of the pre - glitch reference timing model .",
    "this shows that inclusion of the decay time is critical in the fit , further supporting the assertion that what looks like a small depression is probably a small glitch , although timing noise can not be ruled out .",
    "however , one must keep in mind that the function @xmath87 has five parameters , and only five data are used in the fit in this section . while it is true that a set of @xmath50 data points can not be fit to any arbitrary function of @xmath50 parameters , particularly if the function is a mixture of polynomials and exponential",
    ", one must be open to the possibility that the data of sgd may also be due to timing noise .",
    "next , the radio data belonging to mgd are fit to the function @xmath123 of equation @xmath25 .",
    "ideally this should be done after subtracting @xmath87 from the timing residuals of mgd .",
    "here it is assumed that @xmath87 is much smaller than @xmath123 for the mgd epochs ; so @xmath123 is fit to the residuals without subtracting @xmath87 , since the derived glitch parameters are not expected to be statistically rigorous anyway .",
    "it has been verified that results of both approaches are statistically consistent .",
    "a fit varying all parameters converges to the unrealistic situation of @xmath124 being less than the epoch of the last data of sgd . by fixing @xmath114 at various epochs between that of last data point of sgd and that of the first data point of mgd ( non inclusive )",
    ", various solutions can be obtained in which @xmath125 varies consistently .",
    "solutions closer to the former data point appear to have lower standard deviation .",
    "the solution shown in the second row of table  [ tbl3 ] is an illustrative one , where @xmath124 has been fixed to a value mid way between the above two points , while the rest of the four parameters have been varied .",
    "the corresponding curve is the dashed - dotted curve in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "although the parameters in the second row of table  [ tbl3 ] are consistent with the results derived by both jbo and xao for cpg2006 , the radio data used in this work are not suitable to derive rigorous glitch parameters .",
    "it is     @xmath89 ( @xmath90 hz ) & @xmath91 ( @xmath92 s@xmath58 ) & @xmath93 ( @xmath90 hz ) & @xmath94 ( days ) + jbcpme & @xmath126 & @xmath127 & @xmath128 & @xmath129 & @xmath130 + pca & @xmath131 & @xmath132 & @xmath133 & @xmath134 & @xmath135 + hexte & @xmath131 & @xmath136 & @xmath137 & @xmath138 & @xmath139 +    therefore concluded that the cpg2006 event was preceded by a small glitch .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that this result depends critically upon the pre - glitch reference timing model derived above , for which unfortunately only @xmath50 radio timing residuals were available .",
    "therefore the result of this section do not rule out timing noise altogether .",
    "the results derived using radio data are now verified using x - ray data from the rxte observatory . @xcite and @xcite",
    "discuss in detail the analysis of crab pulsar data from the hexte and pca instruments , respectively . in this work one has to additionally filter the pca data for time markers , using the tool _ fselect _ along with a bitfile containing the script `` event = = b1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx '' ( see `` the abc of xte '' guide ) , because of the data mode of pca .",
    "the same must be done when using the tool _ seextrct _ to obtain the light curve .",
    "tempo@xmath23 fits to the @xmath140 pca residuals and the @xmath86 hexte residuals in the pgd ( see the middle and bottom panels of figure  [ fig1 ] ) , resulted in pre - glitch reference timing models that had standard deviation of data tres of @xmath141 @xmath27sec and @xmath142 @xmath27sec , respectively . after taking into account the true degrees of freedom ,",
    "the above two standard deviations become @xmath143 @xmath27sec and @xmath144 @xmath27sec respectively . by including the sgd data",
    "also , the tempo@xmath23 fits yield pre - glitch reference timing models with corrected standard deviations of @xmath145 @xmath27sec and @xmath146 @xmath27sec respectively . by the argument of the previous section both sets of variances ( @xmath145 , @xmath143 and @xmath146 , @xmath144 ) differ at the @xmath147% confidence level .",
    "therefore both the pca and the hexte data confirm the result of the previous section , that one is not justified in including the sgd data to obtain the pre - glitch reference timing model for cpg2006 .",
    "although the glitch behavior in the x - ray data of sgd is evident when these timing models are used , they are clearly worse than the pre - glitch reference timing model obtained from the radio data .",
    "therefore the latter has been used to analyze the x - ray data .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig3 ] shows a closer view of the middle panel of figure  [ fig1 ] . fitting the function @xmath87 to the @xmath86 pca data in the sgd",
    "does not converge to a solution if all five parameters are varied , for several initial values of @xmath114 and @xmath117 .",
    "therefore for illustrative purposes @xmath114 was fixed midway between the last pca data point of pgd and the first pca data point of sgd .",
    "the corresponding @xmath87 is plotted as the dashed line in the top panel of figure  [ fig3 ] , while the corresponding parameters , or the results derived from them , are listed in the third row of table  [ tbl2 ] ; the standard deviation of the data from this solution is @xmath148 @xmath27sec .",
    "attempts to fit the function @xmath123 to the @xmath22 pca data of mgd by varying all five parameters either resulted in unrealistic solutions of @xmath114 , or did not converge to a solution .",
    "therefore for illustrative purposes @xmath114 was fixed midway between the last pca data point of sgd and the first pca data point of mgd .",
    "the corresponding @xmath123 is plotted as the dashed - dotted line in the top panel of figure  [ fig3 ] , while the corresponding parameters , or the results derived from them , are listed in the third row of table  [ tbl3 ] .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig3 ] shows a closer view of the bottom panel of figure  [ fig1 ] . fitting the function @xmath87 to the @xmath149 hexte data in the sgd by",
    "varying all parameters led to results similar to those in the pca case .",
    "therefore for illustrative purposes @xmath114 was fixed midway between the last hexte data point of pgd and the first hexte data point of sgd .",
    "the corresponding @xmath87 is plotted as the dashed line in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig3 ] , while the corresponding parameters , or the results derived from them , are listed in the last row of table  [ tbl2 ] ; the standard deviation of the data from this solution is @xmath150 @xmath27sec .",
    "attempts to fit the function @xmath123 to the @xmath22 hexte data of mgd by varying all five parameters resulted in unrealistic solutions of @xmath114 .",
    "therefore for illustrative purposes @xmath114 was fixed midway between the last hexte data point of sgd and the first hexte data point of mgd .",
    "the corresponding @xmath123 is plotted as the dashed - dotted line in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig3 ] , while the corresponding parameters , or the results derived from them , are listed in the last row of table  [ tbl3 ] .",
    "the behavior of the fits to x - ray data in figure  [ fig3 ] is very similar to that in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is therefore concluded that the x - ray data confirm the results obtained from radio data .",
    "it is clear from the analysis of the monthly radio data ( figure  [ fig2 ] , table  [ tbl2 ] and the analysis of section  [ sec3 ] ) that the crab pulsar most probably suffered a small glitch before cpg2006 .",
    "this is verified by the x - ray data ( figure  [ fig3 ] , table  [ tbl2 ] and the analysis of section  [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the data available for this work is quite sufficient to demonstrate the existence of something that looks like a small glitch , but not to derive rigorous glitch parameters .",
    "so the parameters used to plot the functions @xmath87 and @xmath123 in figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] ( listed in tables  [ tbl2 ] and  [ tbl3 ] ) should be taken as illustrative . even then",
    ", the values of @xmath125 in table  [ tbl3 ] are consistent with the values @xmath151 days derived by @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath152 in the second row of table  [ tbl3 ] is @xmath153 micro hertz , which is consistent with the value of @xmath154 derived by @xcite .",
    "the ratio of change in rotation frequency @xmath155 from the second row of table  [ tbl3 ] is @xmath156 , which is consistent with the value @xmath157 derived by @xcite .",
    "the ratio of change in rotation frequency derivative @xmath158 from the second column of table  [ tbl3 ] is @xmath159 , which is roughly consistent with the value @xmath160 derived by @xcite , and the value @xmath161 estimated from @xcite .",
    "thus the illustrative radio solution in the second row of table  [ tbl3 ] is consistent with earlier estimates ; this is expected since the small glitch perturbs only weakly the pre - glitch reference timing model for the main glitch .",
    "the x - ray solutions in the last two rows of table  [ tbl3 ] are consistent with this radio solution .",
    "this can also be taken as indirect validation of the illustrative radio solution for the small glitch in table  [ tbl2 ] , since this is used to derive the solution for the main glitch .",
    "the x - ray solutions in the last two rows of table  [ tbl2 ] are consistent with the radio solution for the small glitch ( second row of table  [ tbl2 ] ) , as expected .",
    "the small glitch is also evident in the @xmath3  and @xmath4  data of jbcpme . by fitting a straight line to the five @xmath4  data of the pgd",
    ", it is seen that the next five @xmath4  ( belonging to the sgd ) lie systematically lower ( larger in magnitude ) than the line , by at least @xmath162 s@xmath58 , which is the typical signature of a very small glitch in the crab pulsar . by doing the same with the @xmath3   data ,",
    "it is seen that @xmath3  increases systematically in the sgd .",
    "although one expects such an increase to be sudden just after a glitch , this result also indicates that the @xmath3  and @xmath4  of the crab pulsar had probably behaved similar to those during a glitch in the boundary region between pgd and sgd .",
    "the pgd in the radio data apparently can not be extended to lower epochs ; the residuals for the epochs mjd @xmath163 and mjd @xmath164 lie systematically above those of the five pgd residuals .",
    "this is also apparent in the @xmath4  data of jbcpme , which are more positive before the pgd .",
    "did the glitch detector of @xcite detect this small glitch ?",
    "it probably did , and probably classified it as one of their @xmath165 glitch candidates ( gc ) .",
    "@xcite allow for the possibility that some of the gc might be real glitches , but believe most of them are due to timing noise .",
    "therefore it is likely that @xcite believe that this event is not a glitch but is on account of timing noise .",
    "the fact , that the @xmath122 and @xmath117 term in @xmath87 ( in equation @xmath25 ) is required to give a sensible fit to the sgd data , gives some support for the belief that one is dealing with a glitch and not timing noise . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite may have missed this glitch , due to their methodology .",
    "they use @xmath49 times of arrival ( toa ) to obtain the pre - glitch reference timing model , and fit a quadratic function to the next @xmath36 toa .",
    "it is possible that these numbers are inadequate for sensing the small glitch of this work .",
    "furthermore , they were looking for a sudden rise in rotation frequency @xmath3 , whereas , as indicated by the @xmath3 data of jbcpme , this may be a slower glitch . in this context",
    ", this work focuses attention on the problem of distinguishing between a small glitch and timing noise in pulsars .",
    "it appears unlikely that the small glitch and cpg2006 are causally connected , since they are separated by about @xmath166 days .",
    "there are glitches in the crab pulsar separated by much smaller time  the glitches of mjd @xmath167 and mjd @xmath168 are separated by a mere @xmath169 days , although there is doubt whether the latter is a glitch at all @xcite .    as @xcite point out , although the exact mechanism for glitches is not fully understood , the glitch magnitude distribution in general , and the magnitude of the smallest glitch in particular , in the crab pulsar , is an important information .",
    "the magnitude of a glitch is related to the number of super fluid vortices that unpin during the event ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "clearly the smallest glitch in a pulsar will set constraints on the minimum size of the region in the inner crust that is involved in the glitch process .",
    "the numbers derived in the second row of table  [ tbl2 ] are not reliable enough to estimate rigorously the magnitude of the small glitch .",
    "this is best done using the daily sampled data of the jbo .",
    "the higher the dynamic range of glitch magnitudes ( the ratio of the maximum to the minimum observed glitch magnitude ) in the crab pulsar , the better one can derive the distribution of glitch magnitudes ; some theoretical models predict a power law distribution @xcite .",
    "the size of a glitch depends upon the number of unpinned vortices , the details of pinning and repinning of these vortices , and the location of unpining @xcite .",
    "in particular the size of a glitch depends upon the pinning strength , stronger pinning causing larger glitches , although @xcite point out that this belief is not very obvious ",
    "contrary behavior is also possible .",
    "therefore the smallest possible glitch in a pulsar may set constraints on the distribution of pinning strengths in the crust , at the lower end of the distribution .",
    "the smallest possible glitch in a pulsar may also suggest that the crust is lighter rather than heavier @xcite , which may have implications for the equation of state of a neutron star .    in summary",
    ", this work demonstrates a peculiar behavior of the timing residuals of the crab pulsar that started around late march / early april 2006 , and continued up to the epoch of the main glitch .",
    "this work has shown that this behavior is consistent with that of a small glitch .",
    "if this is true , then this is probably the smallest glitch detected so far in the crab pulsar , whose implications have been discussed above . on the other hand this work does not rule out timing noise .",
    "therefore , future pulsar timing programs will need not only better sensitivity but also fast cadences in order to be able to study the small glitches regime . if it turns out that this is indeed timing noise , then there are far reaching implications for the definition of timing noise .",
    "the current consensus is that timing noise is supposed to be that which is left over in timing residuals after the effects of secular variations and glitches have been removed ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly the understanding of the term timing noise needs to be revised if it starts behaving like small glitch .",
    "i thank the referee cristbal espinoza for detailed and helpful comments .",
    "this research made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa - goddard space flight center ."
