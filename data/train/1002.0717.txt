    "although the heisenberg model describes a strongly correlated system , the thermal conductivity is purely ballistic as the energy current commutes with the hamiltonian,@xcite a result that is related to the integrability of this model.@xcite thus the only scattering present is due to the defect and thus its frequency / temperature / coupling strength dependence can be isolated and clearly analyzed . in this context",
    "it was already found that a single potential impurity renders the thermal transport incoherent@xcite with the frequency dependence of the thermal conductivity well described by a lorentzian , at least for a weak impurity .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of a non - interacting system where in spite of the impurity the transport remains coherent described within the landauer formalism by a finite transmission coefficient through the impurity .",
    "thus a single static impurity materializes the many - body character of scattering states .    besides its theoretical interest ,",
    "the effect of ( non)magnetic impurities on the thermal transport of quasi - one dimensional materials as srcuo@xmath1 , sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and the ladder compound la@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 has recently become possible to explore experimentally.@xcite    in this work we use numerical diagonalization techniques - ( full ) exact diagonalization ( ed ) , the finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm)@xcite and the microcanonical lanczos method ( mclm)@xcite - to study the thermal transport in the heisenberg chain model either coupled to a magnetic impurity or perturbed by single and double weak links .",
    "these state of the art techniques are crucial in the attempt to look for the subtle low temperature many - body effects associated with kondo screening .",
    "we consider the one dimensional anisotropic spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model in the presence of a magnetic impurity out of the chain or weak links , @xmath7 where @xmath8 are spin-@xmath0 operators , @xmath9 the in - chain magnetic exchange coupling that we take antiferromagnetic , @xmath10 the chain - impurity coupling , @xmath11 anisotropy parameters and * s * a spin - s magnetic - impurity operator ( @xmath12 ) . in this work",
    "we mostly consider a spin-@xmath0 impurity .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions , @xmath13 , and uniform couplings @xmath14 , except in the study of weak links ( see below ) .",
    "we vary the anisotropy parameters @xmath11 , with @xmath15 , in order to look for the ( healing ) cutting of the chain effects mentioned above .    in our study , based on standard linear response theory ,",

    "we determine the energy current from the hydrodynamic ( @xmath21 ) limit of the energy continuity equation @xmath22 with @xmath23 as ,    @xmath24    showing for simplicity the case @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is obtained by @xmath27 in the cross - product terms ) .",
    "when @xmath28 and all @xmath14 the energy current commutes with the hamiltonian , the transport is purely ballistic and the thermal conductivity consists of only a @xmath29-peak proportional to the thermal drude weight .",
    "starting from the high temperature ( @xmath30 ) limit we can obtain a first impression on the behavior of the frequency dependence of @xmath31 from the 0th and 2nd moments , @xmath32 which are equal to ( for the isotropic point , @xmath25 ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the characteristic impurity spin dependence .",
    "one could expect the 2nd moment to reflect the width of @xmath31 and thus to be related to the inverse scattering time @xmath35 .",
    "we note that for this impurity problem an assumption of a gaussian form @xmath36 would imply from the @xmath37 dependence of @xmath38 that @xmath39 would scale as @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is , however , incorrect as is also evident from the disagreement with higher moments , @xmath42 , which behave all as @xmath43 . for weak - coupling cases , such as a single impurity",
    "weakly coupled to the host chain , we should therefore rather expect a lorentzian - like frequency dependence with a static @xmath44 and a characteristic frequency width @xmath45 .",

    "[ l_scale ] , where from the non - lorentzian shape we must conclude that the memory function also scales as @xmath84 and thus , @xmath85 this is not in contradiction with the moments argument , since the higher moments , @xmath77 , determine the low frequency behavior .",
    "so we can argue that at high frequencies @xmath79 scales as @xmath16 while at low frequencies as @xmath86 . this scenario is indeed verified in fig .",

    ", we can also explain the observed general @xmath51 scaling with the similarity to a noninteracting system - with an impurity .",
    "in the latter case , the characteristic scaling @xmath90 is signature of `` free '' oscillations in the system",
    ".     dependence of scaled @xmath91 and the comparison with the perturbative result .",

    "[ j_scale ] the evolution of the relaxation - rate function @xmath65 with impurity coupling @xmath10 along with a perturbative evaluation @xmath92 using the eigestates of the hamiltonian without the impurity.@xcite it is interesting that the memory function shows an increasingly pronounced structure with minima at approximately the same frequencies , multiples of @xmath93 _ independently of @xmath10 _ and which are not present in the perturbative calculation .",
    "in particular the characteristic frequency of the minima decreases as the anisotropy parameter @xmath94 decreases and thus it apparently related to the velocity of elementary excitations ( spinons ) in the system . we can conjecture that this peak structure is due to a resonant mode , created by multiple forward / backward scattering on the impurity , characteristic for the noninteracting system .",
    "it is remarkable that this happens even in this high temperature limit .",
    "this effect has already been seen in integrable systems where a perturbation seems to affect the totality of the energy spectrum.@xcite now the picture is clear , @xmath95 increases as @xmath96 , scales as @xmath86 at low frequencies and at the same time develops a structure that dominates the behavior of @xmath97 turning the lorentzian weak - coupling shape to a nontrivial one at strong coupling .",
    "next we examine the behavior of the thermal conductivity @xmath31 as we lower the temperature , starting with the influence of static weak exchange links .",
