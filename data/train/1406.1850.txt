    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the most powerful objects in the universe .",
    "the energy output in the @xmath5-rays is in the order of @xmath6 ergs ( assuming isotropic emission ) on second time - scales at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "grbs are divided into two classes , short and long , which are usually defined by @xmath7 @xcite , the time during which the cumulative counts in the detector increases from 5@xmath8 to 95@xmath8 above the background rate .",
    "there are two types of plausible central engine model proposed for grbs : ( 1 ) stellar mass black holes , which accrete material from a remnant star with an extremely high accretion rate ( @xmath0 ( 0.1 - 1 ) @xmath9 @xmath10 ) @xcite ; ( 2 ) rapidly rotating ( @xmath0 ms duration ) , highly magnetised neutron stars ( a proto - magnetar ) @xcite . based on the latter model of the central engine",
    ", @xcite proposed that grbs may be accompanied by very bright , short duration ( @xmath11 ms ) radio bursts , which could be observed at frequencies of tens of mhz .",
    "detection of such radio emission from a grb at a cosmological distance could provide a probe for understanding both the ionised intergalactic medium ( igm ) and grb physics @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that observations of short duration radio pulses from grbs at low radio frequencies ( @xmath12mhz ) would be significantly limited by scattering effects because the radio emission passes through the dense stellar wind of the progenitor or the immediate interstellar medium surrounding the source .",
    "@xcite showed that these propagation effects alter the properties of radiation with brightness temperature @xmath13k , which may hinder the detectability of any radio pulse .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that grbs ( with a magnetar as the central engine ) could produce short duration radio pulses when the supra - massive neutron stars undergo rapid spin down ( due to strong magnetic fields ) within @xmath14 s of their birth , collapsing into black holes as they lose centrifugal support .",
    "these short duration radio pulses are proposed to be detectable at radio frequencies ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ghz , if they are not absorbed by the grb blast wave in front of the emission region .",
    "@xcite suggests that a small fraction of short duration radio pulses could be physically connected with grbs .    in recent years",
    ", there have been number of detections of non - repeating short duration radio pulses .",
    "the dispersion measures ( dm ) of these pulses are so large that the progenitors are suggested to be extragalactic in origin .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of the first such short duration radio pulse ; they discovered a single pulse of duration @xmath17 5ms at a dm of 375 pc @xmath1 from archival data @xcite recorded using the 64 m parkes radio telescope .",
    "@xcite inferred an event rate of 50 @xmath18 ( assuming an isotropic distribution of the sources in the sky ) and proposed that the implied rates of occurrence were compatible with grb rates .",
    "however , there are no recorded grb events satellite was observing at the time and position of the event . ] near the pulse location .",
    "another event was discovered by @xcite from archival data @xcite with the same telescope .",
    "the pulse properties were similar to that reported by @xcite , with a short time scale ( @xmath0 7 ms ) and high dm ( 745 pc @xmath1 ) .",
    "recent analysis of this pulse has suggested it is galactic in origin @xcite    some doubts on the extragalactic origin of these pulses have been put forward , based on the work of @xcite , with the detection of 16 similar highly dispersed pulses from parkes archive data @xcite , all deemed as terrestrial in origin .",
    "most recently , however , the evidence for an extragalactic origin has strengthened significantly , with the discovery of four new highly dispersed pulses by @xcite .",
    "@xcite coined the term fast radio burst ( frb ) to describe these bursts .",
    "the frbs were detected with dms in the range 553 to 1103 pc @xmath1 . based on their properties , @xcite infers the frb event rate ( @xmath19 ) to be @xmath20 in the comoving sample volume that contains @xmath21 late type galaxies , which is @xmath0 @xmath22 times larger than the grb rates ( @xmath23 = @xmath24 ) . using the inconsistency in the event rates and , in particular , with no known grb events coincident with the frbs , @xcite rules out grbs as possible progenitors for most frbs .",
    "all six frbs mentioned above were detected by the 64 m parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver , creating concerns about the astrophysical origin of the pulses .",
    "most recently , @xcite reported a discovery of a seventh frb in the 1.4 ghz pulsar alfa survey with the 300 m arecibo telescope , the first frb discovered from a geographical location other than parkes .",
    "this frb was found at low galactic latitude ( @xmath25 ) with a dm of @xmath26 and pulse width @xmath27 . despite the low galactic latitude",
    ", the high dm suggests an extragalactic origin .",
    "none of the frbs from parkes or arecibo to - date have been associated with a grb , although the theoretical possibility that they might be connected has motivated several experiments to look for coincident grb / frb emission .",
    "* hereafter b12 ) performed a targeted survey to detect short duration radio pulses from grbs at 1.4ghz .",
    "b12 observed nine grbs , both long and short , using a 12 m radio telescope located at the parkes observatory .",
    "b12 reported the detection of two single radio pulses from two long grbs with s / n @xmath28 6@xmath29 .",
    "the pulses were detected 524 and 1076 seconds after the @xmath5-ray emission from the grbs .",
    "the dms of the pulses were 195 pc @xmath1 and 570 pc @xmath1 , which are large compared to the expected galactic electron - density contribution @xcite to the dm , indicating the possibility that the bursts are extragalactic in origin and possibly from the grbs .",
    "similar to the b12 experiment , there have been a number of past and ongoing experiments searching for frb - like emission from the prompt phase of grbs at low and high radio frequencies @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed 19 grb events at 151mhz between 1970 and 1973 , with a time resolution of 0.3s ; they searched for coincident radio pulses with two or more stations over periods @xmath30 to @xmath31 relative to the grb event times .",
    "their search failed to locate any astronomical radio pulse above their sensitivity limit of @xmath32 .",
    "two other grbs were observed by @xcite , who performed an automatic rapid radio follow - up experiment at 151mhz , with a time resolution of 1.5s ; they reported a non - detection at a sensitivity of @xmath33 of 73jy .",
    "@xcite observed 7 grbs between 1992 and 1994 , covering a large range of frequencies between 40 and 1000mhz using three similar spectrometers , with a time resolution of 0.15s .",
    "although the experiment sensitivity was low ( @xmath32 ) , the spectral coverage made this experiment very interesting .",
    "similarly , @xcite observed 32 grbs at 73.75mhz from 1997 to 1998 and had a wide range of sensitivity for each grb .",
    "they reported a non detection at sensitivity limit of @xmath34 for integration times of @xmath35 .",
    "most recently , @xcite reported the observations of 12 grbs at 74mhz , five grbs at 52mhz , and 17 grbs at 37.9mhz with a time resolution of 5s .",
    "similarly , @xcite reported the observation of four grbs at 15ghz with a time resolution of 0.5s .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite did not detect any frb - like emission from the observed grbs .",
    "the sensitivities of the above mentioned experiments were generally low , however they have motivated a number of follow - up experiments including this work and a recent follow up project proposed by bannister et al ( 2013 ) ( vlba project codes bb317 and bb325 ) to use one or more very long baseline array ( vlba ; @xcite ) dishes to automatically follow up grb alerts during telescope idle time .",
    "the vlba - grb experiment searches for frbs using the existing v - fastr system @xcite .    in this paper , we describe observations performed at 2.3ghz using the hobart 26 m radio telescope to search for frbs associated with grbs .",

    "data processing was performed on the curtin university parallel processor for astronomy ( cuppa ) , a 20 node computer cluster operated by curtin university .      in this section",
    "we describe the data processing pipeline ( figure [ flowchart ] ) used to search for single short duration radio pulses in our data .",
    "the search pipeline has multiple stages : correlation ; time averaging ; radio frequency interference ( rfi ) excision ; dedispersion ; event detection ; and classification of events .",
    "several of our tools were reused from the v - fastr experiment @xcite which can read lba data natively .",
    "the first step in the processing pipeline was to pass the data through a spectrometer to form channelised total power for each polarisation .",
    "the 2-bit digitised voltage samples from each polarisation were decoded and sent to a software correlator .",
    "the correlator is an fx design with a configurable number of spectral channels and averaging time .",
    "we used @xmath92 mhz spectral channels , formed via fft , and an averaging time of 640@xmath2s .",
    "the output of the software correlator was written to files for subsequent processing .",
    "the intrinsic width of pulses are generally unknown . because the dispersion and scattering affects the observed width of the pulse , a large parameter space of pulse widths must be searched @xcite . to obtain optimal sensitivity ,",
    "the correlated time series were averaged for pulse widths ranging from 1.28ms to 20.48ms .",
    "this was achieved by averaging @xmath93 time samples together , where @xmath94 ranges from 1 to 5 , and searching each averaged time series independently .",
    "an additional time averaged series was generated at 25.60ms by averaging 40 time samples together ( which is not a power of 2 ) , to match the width used by b12 in their experiment .",
    "observations at 2.3ghz are generally affected by radio frequency interference ( rfi ) from terrestrial transmitters , radars , satellites etc . , which changes the total power as a function of frequency and time .",
    "therefore , identification and excision of rfi was undertaken .",
    "first , we excise the time samples in each frequency channel that were affected by sporadic rfi .",
    "the top panel of figure [ rfi ] shows an example of sporadic , wide - band rfi , where the power level in all the frequency channels over short time scales ( in this case @xmath0 4ms ) is much higher when compared to the typical mean power in neighbouring time samples across the frequency band .",
    "the top panel of figure [ impulsiverfi ] shows an example of sporadic narrow - band rfi , where the power level in a frequency channel over a short time ( in this case @xmath95s ) is high when compared to the typical mean power in the neighbouring time samples in that frequency channel .",
    "our rfi excision algorithm used a thresholding method to identify samples in the time domain which were affected by rfi .",
    "first , we calculated the local variance ( @xmath96 ) of the time samples in each frequency channel over an adjustable time range ( @xmath0 10 sec ) and then compared to the power ( amplitude ) of each time sample .",
    "the time samples that exceeded a pre - set threshold ( here the threshold was set to @xmath97 ) were excised from the time series and replaced with the mean power value estimated for each frequency channel over the band .",
    "we conservatively chose a 5@xmath98 threshold for rfi excision , because we did not want to clip the thermal noise distribution is @xmath99 and for @xmath100 the probability is @xmath101 .",
    "we have @xmath102 independent samples , therefore , at @xmath103 we would be effectively clipping @xmath0 1 sample as a false positive , compared to when a 3@xmath29 threshold is chosen we would be effectively clipping @xmath02600 samples .",
    "this could skew the thermal noise distribution in the data . ] .",
    "the bottom panels of figures [ rfi ] and [ impulsiverfi ] show the results of our excision algorithm .",
    "+   +    next , we manually identified and excised persistent narrow - band rfi which are constant in time over a frequency channel .",
    "the top panel of figure [ rfi ] shows an example of persistent narrow band rfi where the power in a frequency channel is higher compared to the power in the neighbouring channels across the frequency band .",
    "the affected channels , including the lower band edge spectral channel ( dc channel generally has spurious high power due to sampler offsets ) , were recorded in a flagging file .",
    "the dedisperser ( the next stage in the pipeline ) reads the flagging files for bad channels and ignored the bad channels in further processing .",

    "any incoming astronomical impulsive radio signal will , in general , be dispersed in time across the spectral channels due to the ionised component of the interstellar and intergalactic media @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic signal can largely be recovered by incoherent dedispersion , by applying an appropriate time delay for each spectral channel and adding power across all the spectral channels .",
    "the time delay between two frequencies is given by @xmath104 , where the dm ( pc @xmath1 ) is the integrated column density of free electrons along the line of sight and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the low and high frequencies in ghz , respectively @xcite .",
    "we use dart ( dedisperser of autocorrelations for radio transients ) to perform the incoherent dedispersion , a detailed description of which is given by @xcite .",
    "the incoming data to dart are ordered in frequency and time for each polarisation .",
    "the dedispersion process sums the power across channels , with the delay for each channel according to the frequency and dm . at the output",
    ", dart combines both polarisations and generates a dedispersed time series for each dm .",
    "we dedisperse the data with dm steps as listed in table [ dmtable ] ranging from 0 - 5000 pc @xmath1 .",
    "the choice of dm steps was made by setting the time delay ( @xmath107 ) between highest ( @xmath106 ) and lowest ( @xmath105 ) spectral channels equal to the data sampling time ( integration time ) .",
    "choosing dm steps smaller than the data sampling time leads to highly correlated time samples , since the dedispersed time series are virtually identical for neighbouring dm steps .",
    "dart is flexible when compared to the taylor tree algorithm @xcite , because it can dedisperse the signals beyond the diagonal dm , the dm where the gradient of the dispersion curve is one time sample per spectral channel .",
    "the dm steps across the dm range are linearly distributed for the first few dm steps , before progressing geometrically , with a growth rate of 1.02 .",
    "this results in equal spacings at lower dm and increasingly larger spacings at higher dm .",

    "after dedispersion , each time series is searched for events above a defined signal to noise threshold . in the detector ,",
    "the time series are divided into small time segments ( @xmath109 s ) .",
    "we chose this length of time because visual inspection of the data showed that the total power sometimes changed on time - scales longer than this .",
    "if longer time segments were used this would artificially raise the variance estimate .",
    "each time segment is high - pass filtered , by subtracting a 100 timestep moving average from each sample .",
    "this reduces any long term power variations due to system temperature ( @xmath81 ) changes - atmosphere , receiver response etc . , which may bias variance estimates on time scales of 100s of samples , while retaining sensitivity to short time scale variations .",
    "we note that the high - pass filter window is longer than the expected pulse width of an astronomical event .",

    "we adopt use the standard deviation because the behaviour of this statistic is well understood when a finite number of samples are used for its estimation .      the next step in the pipeline",

    "this method is more reliable when compared to the method adopted by b12 to account for the false positive rate by randomising the spectral channels , using data from the grb observations .",
    "b12 showed that randomising the spectral channels would preserve the properties of thermal noise fluctuations , narrow band and wide band rfi , but the presence of impulsive rfi that spans multiple channels are destroyed .",
    "this will reduce the number of false positive events due to thermal noise fluctuations and rfi .",
    "this effect will be high if the rate of impulsive rfi that spans over multiple channels is high , which leads to an inaccurate estimation of false positives .",
