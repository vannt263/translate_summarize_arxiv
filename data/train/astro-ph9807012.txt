    "the liquid core , solid crust and overlying ocean and atmosphere give a neutron star ( ns ) a very rich spectrum of non - radial oscillations , with acoustic p - modes in the 10 khz range and a variety of lower frequency g - modes from the toroidal and spheroidal displacements of the crust and surface layers ( see mcdermott , van horn & hansen 1988 for an overview ) .",
    "non - radial g - mode oscillations have been studied extensively for isolated and slowly rotating radio pulsars , where the atmosphere and ocean are quiescent .",
    "these studies can be separated by the sources of buoyancy that were considered : ( 1 ) entropy gradients ( mcdermott , van horn & scholl 1983 ; mcdermott et al .",
    "1988 ) , ( 2 ) density discontinuities ( finn 1987 ; mcdermott 1990 ; strohmayer 1993 ) and ( 3 ) mean molecular weight gradients due to @xmath8equilibrium in the core ( reisenegger & goldreich 1992 ) . unfortunately",
    ", none of these modes have been securely identified with any particular radio pulsar phenomenon .",
    "there are also many accreting neutron stars in binary systems that emit much of their accretion luminosity in x - rays ( lewin , van paradijs & van den heuvel 1995 ) .",
    "the thermal and compositional structure of these accreting nss is quite different from that of the isolated radio pulsars , and is far from equilibrium .",
    "there have been previous studies of non - radial oscillations in these objects ( mcdermott & taam 1987 ; bildsten & cutler 1995 ( hereafter bc95 ) ; bildsten , ushomirsky & cutler 1996 ( hereafter buc96 ) ; strohmayer & lee 1996 ( hereafter ( sl96 ) ) . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the g - mode spectrum of the ocean of an accreting ns , focusing on the critical effects of hydrogen electron capture .",
    "much of this work is motivated by the rich spectrum of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) seen in the luminosity of the brightest accreting neutron stars . utilizing _",
    "_ data , hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) found that the highest accretion rate objects ( @xmath9 ) fall into two separate classes .",
    "six objects trace out all or part of a `` z '' in an x - ray color - color diagram and exhibit time - dependent behavior that correlates with the position along the z. these `` z sources '' have qpo s in the 1550 hz and 57 hz range with up to 10% modulation of the x - ray flux .",
    "the other objects fall into separated regions of the color - color diagram and do not show this distinctive qpo phenomenology .",
    "these `` atoll sources '' accrete at lower rates than the z sources and exhibit type i x - ray bursts resulting from the unstable ignition of the accumulated hydrogen and helium ( see bildsten 1998a for a recent review ) .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) has recently added to this list of qpo phenomenology .",
    "two drifting khz qpos are seen in the persistent emission from both atoll and z sources , and coherent oscillations have been observed during type i x - ray bursts from several atoll sources ( see strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 for an example ) . in these objects ,",
    "the khz qpos are separated by a frequency identical to that seen in the burst , leading naturally to a beat frequency model in which the difference frequency is the ns spin frequency ( strohmayer et al .",
    "the physical origin of the upper frequency differs in the models ( see van der klis 1998 for a summary ) , and usually involves the kepler frequency at some special place in the accretion disk ( kaaret , ford & chen 1997 ; zhang , strohmayer & swank 1997 ; miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "the inferred spin frequencies are in a remarkably narrow range , 250500 hz ( white & zhang 1997 ; van der klis 1998 ; bildsten 1998b ) .",
    "there are also many qpos with frequencies less than 100 hz seen in the atoll sources .",
    "stella & vietri ( 1998 ) proposed that these might be due to lense - thirring precession of the inner accretion disk .",
    "it may be that all of the @xmath10 hz and khz qpos can be accommodated within the existing models ( see van der klis 1995 , 1998 ) that use the accretion disk and/or spherical flow to generate the periodic phenomena . however , it is important to pursue non - radial oscillations of the surface layers of the ns as a possible source of some of these periodicities .",
    "the predicted frequencies are well - constrained , depend on the underlying ns structure and have well - understood dispersion relations , even when the ns is rapidly rotating ( buc96 ) .",
    "this means that the successful identification of a non - radial pulsation with an observed frequency would tell us much about the thermal and compositional makeup of the ns and measure or constrain the rotation rate and magnetic field .",
    "in most cases where stellar pulsations are studied , the underlying stellar model is reasonably well understood and constrained via other observations .",
    "initial theoretical work then consists of finding the adiabatic mode structure and exploring possible excitation mechanisms , usually focusing on the @xmath11-mechanism which relies on opacity changes during the pulsations ( see cox 1980 for an excellent overview ) .",
    "the situation is quite different in an accreting ns .",
    "the conditions in the outer layers can change on short timescales , the deep internal structure depends on the accretion history and there is a broader range of excitation possibilities .",
    "we now briefly outline the underlying ns structure and the resulting g - mode spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : scheme ] is a schematic of the ns atmosphere and ocean . for accretion rates",
    "@xmath12 , the accreted hydrogen ( h ) and helium ( he ) rich material burns unstably at a density of @xmath13 and within a few hours to days upon arrival on the star .",
    "the very high temperatures reached ( @xmath14 ) during the thermal instability produce elements at and beyond the iron group .",
    "the isotopic mixture from this burning is not well known , though it seems to always be the case that a substantial amount of h ( the residual mass fraction is typically @xmath15 ) remains unburned .",
    "the ashes from the burning accumulate on the ns , undergo further compression and form a relativistically degenerate ocean .",
    "the hydrogen is eventually depleted by electron captures at @xmath16 , leading to an abrupt rise in density at that location . at still higher densities , @xmath17@xmath18 ,",
    "the material crystallizes and forms the crust .",
    "the thickness of the ocean is @xmath19 .",
    "there is no overt evidence for magnetic fields on these nss ( i.e. none of them are persistent x - ray pulsars ) and most arguments about the nature of type i x - ray bursts limit @xmath20 ( bildsten 1998a ) , weak enough not to affect the ocean g - modes ( bc95 ) .",
    "there has been prior work on g - modes in the upper atmosphere of the ns , above and around the h / he burning region .",
    "mcdermott & taam ( 1987 ) calculated g - modes of a bursting atmosphere . sl96",
    "calculated the non - adiabatic mode structure for atmospheres accreting and burning in steady - state and found that g - modes may be excited by the @xmath21-mechanism ( i.e. by the nuclear burning ) when @xmath22 . however",
    ", steady - state burning does not occur at these low @xmath23 s , and realistic calculations for the time dependent ns atmosphere have yet to be carried out .",
    "our focus in this paper is on the adiabatic mode structure in the deep ocean underneath the h / he burning where the thermal time ( hours to days ) is much longer than the mode period .",
    "the g - modes reside in the ocean as they are effectively excluded from the crust by the restoring force from the finite shear modulus there ( mcdermott et al . 1988 ;",
    "if the ns is slowly rotating , the dispersion relation for these modes is that for shallow water waves , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the transverse wavenumber and @xmath26 is the angular eigenvalue .",
    "the transverse wavenumber changes if the star is rapidly rotating , but this is easily calculable ( buc96 ) and it is straightforward to find the g - mode spectrum from the non - rotating calculations .",
    "the different sources of buoyancy yield a rich spectrum of g - modes .",
    "the abrupt rise in density associated with the hydrogen electron capture boundary layer supports a density discontinuity mode of frequency @xmath27 for @xmath3 and @xmath28 ( equation [ [ eq : fd ] ] ) .",
    "the internal buoyancy due to the composition gradient within the electron capture boundary layer creates a new spectrum of modes which are `` trapped '' .",
    "much of the mode energy is confined to the boundary layer and our wkb estimate of the mode frequency gives @xmath29 for @xmath3 and @xmath28 ( equation [ [ eq : ftr ] ] ) .",
    "where @xmath30 is the number of nodes in the boundary layer .",
    "there is also a set of thermal g - modes ( bc95 ) in the same frequency range as the trapped modes , which are separated by the density discontinuity into two distinct sets ( see  [ sec : thmodes ] ) .",
    "we begin in  2 by explaining the physics of the deep ocean , the electron captures that occur there and the subsequent neutron captures by the heavy nuclei .",
    "we introduce a convenient fitting formula for the electron capture rate and use it to generate a series of stellar models for the subsequent seismic investigation .",
    "section 3 summarizes the equations for non - radial oscillations , discusses the various sources of buoyancy in the deep ocean and our method for solving the eigenvalue problem .",
    "we present the full spectrum of g - modes for isothermal oceans in  4 .",
    "there , we show both the modes due to the electron capture discontinuity and the `` trapped '' modes , and find that the thermal modes are split into two distinct sets by the density discontinuity .",
    "we use the wkb approximation to obtain reliable frequency estimates for these modes .",
    "we construct a few realistic non - isothermal ocean models in  5 and show their g - mode spectra .",
    "we summarize our results in  6 and discuss the effects of rapid rotation and the important issues of mode excitation , damping and transmittal of the signal to the observer .",
    "rosenbluth et al . ( 1973 ) first noted that accreted matter would undergo electron capture on hydrogen ( @xmath31 ) once high enough densities were reached ( @xmath32 ) for the electron fermi energy to exceed the 1293 kev threshold .",
    "hydrogen electron captures have since been studied in two very different contexts in accreting neutron stars .",
    "the first is at very low accretion rates , where the thermonuclear consumption of hydrogen ( say via the cno or pp cycle ) is so slow that the matter reaches the capture density prior to having burned any hydrogen . in this hydrogen - rich environment ,",
    "the neutrons created by this process are immediately captured by protons ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "further reactions burn this matter to at least helium , releasing 7 mev per accreted proton .",
    "van horn & hansen ( 1974 ) modeled transient x - ray sources as the result of electron capture triggered thermonuclear flashes on low mass ( @xmath34 ) neutron stars .",
    "a variant of this model was later invoked as a possible source of local gamma - ray bursts by hameury et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , who found that the accretion rates where the electron capture ignites a thermonuclear instability is comparable to that expected from a lone neutron star steadily accreting from the interstellar medium .",
    "the second context is at the high accretion rates typical for the brightest x - ray sources . in these stars ,",
    "the matter undergoes unstable h / he burning within a few hours to days of arrival on the ns , long before reaching densities high enough for electron capture .",
    "provided @xmath35 ( bildsten 1998a ) , the h burning ( via the @xmath8-limited hot cno cycle ) is thermally stable while the h accumulates . for accretion rates in excess of @xmath36 ( bildsten 1998a ) the cno cycle can not consume all of the h",
    "before the he unstably ignites ( lamb & lamb 1978 ; taam & picklum 1979 ; fujimoto , hanawa & miyaji 1981 ) in a local thermonuclear flash . for @xmath37 , the h is completely burned in a stable manner and the accumulated pile of pure he unstably ignites .",
    "there are many neutron stars accreting at rates comparable to @xmath38",
    ". however , the strong dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath39 and @xmath40 makes it difficult to know in which regime a particular star is burning , especially if a large amount of spallation occurs when the infalling matter decelerates at the surface ( bildsten , salpeter & wasserman 1992 ) .",
    "the ashes from these two types of unstable burning are quite different . in the pure he case ,",
    "the ashes are mostly @xmath41ni ( joss 1978 ; ayasli & joss 1982 ) and there is little to no hydrogen left at densities in excess of @xmath42 .",
    "things are different when the he ignites and burns in a hydrogen - rich environment ( @xmath43 ) , as we now discuss .    during the thermonuclear flash in the",
    "mixed h / he regime , hydrogen burning is accelerated by freshly minted seed nuclei produced by he burning , enhancing the local energy release and substantially complicating the nuclear reaction chains .",
    "the very high temperatures reached ( @xmath44 ) during the thermal instability produce elements beyond the iron group ( hanawa , sugimoto & hashimoto 1983 ; wallace & woosley 1984 ; schatz et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the isotopic mixture from this burning is still not well known , though everyone agrees that a substantial amount of hydrogen ( the residual mass fraction is typically @xmath15@xmath45 ) remains unburned ( ayasli & joss 1982 ; woosley & weaver 1984 ; taam et al . 1993 ; schatz et al .",
    "as the mix of h and extremely heavy elements accumulates beneath the h / he burning layers , at temperatures in the range @xmath46@xmath47 , some proton captures by the heavy nuclei occur ( schatz 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "however , the main proton consumption occurs when the matter has been compressed by accretion to densities high enough for hydrogen electron capture ( woosley & weaver 1984 ; fushiki et al .",
    "1992 ; taam et al .",
    "electron capture onto the nuclei themselves occurs at much greater densities and has been discussed previously by sato ( 1979 ) , haensel & zdunik ( 1990a , 1990b ) and blaes et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .    in this section",
    ", we discuss the nuclear physics of the electron capture transition layer in the ocean underneath the h / he burning layer for those objects with @xmath43 .",
    "we find that the neutrons produced by the electron captures recombine with the heavy nuclei , substantially changing the mix of heavy elements in the layer and below .",
    "our present motivation is to calculate the internal buoyancy associated with the composition gradient in the layer where electron captures are occurring , and the resulting spectrum of g - modes .",
    "we find trapped g - modes and a density discontinuity g - mode that directly depend on the internal buoyancy of the electron capture transition layer , and thus only arise when hydrogen is present at these large depths .",
    "the presence of such g - modes would identify the star as being in the @xmath48 regime .      the electron capture rate for hydrogen ( i.e. @xmath49 ) residing in an electron gas at temperature @xmath50 with fermi energy @xmath51 ( including electron rest mass ) is @xmath52 ( lang 1980 ) where @xmath53 as inferred from the measured neutron half - life ( barnett et al .",
    "1996 ) and the known @xmath54 value .",
    "the function @xmath55 is a dimensionless phase space integral over the electron energy @xmath56 , @xmath57}},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the energy threshold for the reaction .",
    "we have evaluated the integral in equation ( [ eq : truerat ] ) and agree with the tabulated rates of oda et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to within 2% .",
    "for the purposes of both analytical insight and numerical speed , we now discuss a few limiting forms for the capture rate and present a convenient fitting formula .",
    "much insight is gained if we assume relativistic electrons and neglect the @xmath59 term in the integral @xmath55 .",
    "there are then two limits to discuss . for @xmath60 , captures only occur once the threshold is exceeded . for values of the fermi energy slightly above threshold ( @xmath61 ) ,",
    "the integral becomes @xmath62 when @xmath63 , captures only occur if the electrons have a finite temperature .",
    "the integral can be approximately found when @xmath64 , giving @xmath65 so that most captured electrons are far out on the thermal tail of the distribution .",
    "these limiting forms motivate a fitting formulae for the rates that we now introduce .",
    "since this might prove a convenient form for others to use , we motivate our choice and discuss how to use it .",
    "it represents a modified ( and smooth ) combination of equations ( [ eq : caprat ] ) and ( [ eq : captemp ] ) .",
    "the electron capture rate is temperature sensitive even above threshold when @xmath66 .",
    "we thus add a term @xmath67 to @xmath51 in equation ( [ eq : caprat ] ) which provides some thermal `` fuzziness '' to the fermi energy .",
    "the proportionality constant and fermi energy to connect the modified equation ( [ eq : caprat ] ) with the unmodified equation ( [ eq : captemp ] ) are found by demanding that the rate and its first derivative with respect to @xmath51 ( at constant @xmath50 ) are continuous there .",
    "this results in the form @xmath68 &   $ e_f < q+k_bt \\ln ( 9/2)$\\cr   ( 1/3)(e_f+(3-\\ln 9/2)k_bt - q)^3 & $ e_f > q+k_bt \\ln",
    "( 9/2)$ , \\cr}\\ ] ] which reproduces the electron capture rate within a factor of two over a large range of temperatures and densities .",
    "figure [ fig : fits ] shows the ratio of the true integral ( eqn . [",
    "[ eq : truerat ] ] ) to that given by equation ( [ eq : ratfit ] ) for a range of @xmath51 and temperatures of @xmath69 and 10 .",
    "clearly the fit does rather well at representing a function that is changing by orders of magnitude in this range .",
    "the growing deviation at @xmath70 arises from our neglect of the next order term in equation ( [ eq : caprat ] ) , which is @xmath71 .",
    "we implement this fit by first tabulating ( as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath50 ) the ratio of the real answer to the fit .",
    "then , for any @xmath51 and @xmath50 , we use equation ( [ eq : ratfit ] ) to evaluate @xmath55 and then find the correction via interpolation within this pre - made table .",
    "this proves to be quite accurate with a relatively small table , as the fitting formula takes care of most of the strong variations in @xmath55 .",
    "we describe the structure of the hydrogen electron capture transition layer in  [ sec : laystr ] , but we can obtain a rough picture of where the electron captures occur by noting that in steady state , the hydrogen depletes when the lifetime to electron capture , @xmath72 , becomes comparable to the time to reach that depth , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the local accretion rate ( mass accreted per unit time per unit area ) and @xmath75 is the column depth .",
    "the local eddington accretion rate is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the thomson cross - section and @xmath78 is the mean molecular weight per electron .",
    "for simplicity , we take @xmath79 to be the value for @xmath80 and @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : timecomp ] shows @xmath81 as a function of @xmath51 for many different temperatures . from top to bottom , the solid lines are for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the vertical dashed line displays @xmath84 .",
    "the lower ( upper ) dotted line shows @xmath85 for @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , where , for simplicity , we have assumed the degenerate electrons provide all the pressure .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath88 at @xmath89 and @xmath90 at @xmath91 , substantial pre - threshold capture occurs , i.e. many protons are consumed while @xmath92 .",
    "we discuss this further in  [ sec : laystr ] .      in the hydrogen - rich environment , the neutrons produced by the electron captures rapidly thermalize via elastic scattering with protons and undergo a radiative capture ( free decay is irrelevant for these high densities , as the radiative capture times are @xmath93 seconds ) .",
    "woosley & weaver ( 1984 ) and taam et al . ( 1996 ) assumed that the neutrons would capture onto protons , starting a chain of rapid nuclear reactions up to the fe group .",
    "we find that this is not the case .",
    "the reaction rate for capture onto protons ( @xmath94 ) is @xmath95 ( caughlan & fowler 1988 ) , whereas typical rates for neutron captures onto heavy nuclei are @xmath96@xmath97 , nearly two orders of magnitude larger .",
    "we thus find that , for the hydrogen mass fractions we consider , most neutrons capture onto the heavy nuclei , releasing the typical 78 mev binding energy of a nucleon in a heavy nucleus .",
    "for example , from cowan , thielemann & truran ( 1991 ) , the neutron capture rate for @xmath41fe is @xmath98 ( at 30 kev ) , so that neutrons will capture preferentially onto iron rather than protons when their ratio by number is @xmath99 , requiring @xmath100 .",
    "similar conclusions apply to most nuclei we could consider .",
    "the neutron captures substantially modify the isotopic mix of heavy elements . at a particular depth in the transition layer ,",
    "those elements with larger neutron capture cross sections grow more and more neutron rich until they become @xmath8-unstable on a timescale comparable to the flow time across the region ( i.e. days , see figure [ fig : timecomp ] ) . since the composition of the ashes from the h / he burning is still unknown , we adopt a simple model in which we assume that prior to electron capture the gas consists of protons , electrons and a _ single _ species of nucleus of mass @xmath101 and charge @xmath102 .",
    "the mass fraction of protons @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 , so that the density of nuclei is @xmath105 and the local number ratio of protons to nuclei is @xmath106 .",
    "the mean molecular weight per electron for this mixture is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the electron number density .",
    "we assume that only one nuclear species is present at a particular depth .",
    "given the starting values @xmath109 and @xmath110 , the value of @xmath103 at a particular depth fixes the mass of the nucleus @xmath111 due to baryon conservation , @xmath112 .",
    "thus @xmath111 , in some sense , represents the average weight of the nuclei present , and is a continuous variable .",
    "the models we discuss throughout this paper are for the `` neutron - rich '' case in which we neglect @xmath8 decays and keep @xmath113 fixed and let @xmath111 grow without bound .",
    "we have also constructed models in which the nuclei follow the valley of stability , i.e. at a particular depth we choose the most stable @xmath113 corresponding to the local value of @xmath111 .",
    "clearly , the real composition of the layer lies somewhere between these two cases .",
    "however , we find that ( except for the density discontinuity mode , see  [ sec : dismodes ] ) the adiabatic seismology depends very weakly on the exact nuclear physics in the layer , and so we adopt the `` neutron rich '' models for simplicity .",
    "we have yet to fully explore the rich nuclear physics of this transition layer .      at the accretion rates of interest for the bright x - ray sources ,",
    "the downward diffusive drift speed of a nucleus in the hydrogen - rich region is much less than the downward flow speed from accretion , @xmath114 .",
    "the nuclei thus do not have time to settle out ( gravitationally separate ) from the hydrogen before the electron captures occur .",
    "for example ( using equation 4.3 from bildsten , salpeter & wasserman 1993 ) , for temperatures in excess of @xmath115 , there is no relative diffusion of protons and heavy ions provided @xmath116 .",
    "thus there are no relative separations in the continuity equations ( brown & bildsten 1998 ) , and we construct models of the hydrogen electron capture boundary layer by integrating the continuity equation for protons , @xmath117 we rewrite this equation in terms of the column density , @xmath118 , and the hydrogen mass fraction @xmath103 , giving @xmath119 where we have used the mass continuity equation . in a steady - state ,",
    "the electron captures are balanced by the accretion flow , so that @xmath120 since the temperature gradient across the transition layer is small ( see  [ sec : nonthmod ] ) , we first presume the layer is isothermal in our calculations . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : simpcont ] ) gives a complete description of the transition layer .",
    "we use these isothermal models in  [ sec : modes ] to illustrate the spectrum of ocean g - modes .",
    "we discuss realistic non - isothermal models of the whole ocean in  [ sec : models ] , in which the heat equation must also be integrated .",
    "a discussion of the equation of state and the microphysics of the ocean can be found in bc95 .",
    "the temperature of the ocean is @xmath121@xmath122 .",
    "we now make a simple model of the hydrogen electron capture layer at zero temperature . in this case",
    "no electron capture occurs until @xmath123 .",
    "we neglect the electron rest mass , assume the boundary layer is thin , write the pressure as @xmath124 , and use the capture rate of equation ( [ eq : caprat ] ) .",
    "we then integrate equation ( [ eq : simpcont ] ) analytically , obtaining @xmath125 , where @xmath126 if we measure the characteristic `` thickness '' , @xmath127 , of the electron capture layer by the depth at which the hydrogen is 90% depleted , we find @xmath128 integrating the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath129 gives the corresponding physical thickness of the layer , @xmath130 where @xmath131 and the subscript @xmath132 denotes initial values , @xmath109 is the initial hydrogen mass fraction , @xmath133 , and we have assumed that @xmath113 is constant through the layer . we include the scalings with @xmath134 and @xmath135 in these formulae as they are equally applicable to electron capture layers associated with nuclei at much larger depths .",
    "numerical integrations of equation ( [ eq : simpcont ] ) with the full @xmath60 equation of state for the electrons and the exact expression for the electron capture rate ( equation [ [ eq : truerat ] ] ) find good agreement with both the scalings and prefactors given in equations ( [ eq : thickness ] ) and ( [ eq : physthick ] ) ( @xmath136 for @xmath137 after which the term @xmath138 neglected in equation ( [ eq : caprat ] ) becomes important ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : timecomp ] , at high enough temperatures significant electron capture occurs pre - threshold . for a particular @xmath74",
    ", there is a critical temperature @xmath139 above which this occurs , roughly given by @xmath140 from equation ( [ eq : thickness ] ) .",
    "we accurately estimate @xmath139 by integrating the continuity equation ( [ eq : simpcont ] ) with the _ pre - threshold _",
    "expression for the electron capture rate ( equation [ [ eq : captemp ] ] ) . again neglecting the electron mass",
    ", we find that when @xmath141 more than @xmath142 of the protons have captured electrons pre - threshold .",
    "the prefactor in this expression is taken from numerical integration of equation ( [ eq : simpcont ] ) for an isothermal layer with the full electron capture rate ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : truerat ] ] ) and equation of state .",
    "figure [ fig : tmdot ] shows the critical lines in the @xmath143@xmath50 plane for which 50% and 90% of the protons capture pre - threshold .",
    "there is excellent agreement with the analytic estimate .",
    "our present focus is on those g - modes that reside predominantly in the liquid ocean that lies beneath the h / he burning layer .",
    "the oscillations are adiabatic there since the local thermal time ( hours to days ) is much longer than the g - mode period .",
    "we first discuss the different sources of buoyancy in the ocean and then describe the adiabatic perturbation equations and our method for solving them .",
    "the g - mode frequencies are set by the local buoyancy force , which results from the density contrast between a displaced fluid element and the background fluid .",
    "there are two contributions to this density contrast .",
    "the first is thermal buoyancy , which arises because the change in density of the fluid element as it is adiabatically displaced differs from the change in the background density due to the non - isentropic density gradient .",
    "the second contribution is from composition gradients .",

    "these modes were not found in the density discontinuity mode studies of isolated neutron stars ( finn 1987 ; mcdermott 1990 ; strohmayer 1993 ) , as in that environment the electron capture transitions were presumed ( most likely safely ) to be sharp .",

    "we also took @xmath269 , as no hydrogen is present at these depths .",
    "the upper and lower thermal mode frequencies are similar because the difference in @xmath149 above and below the electron capture layer is compensated by the greater depth of the ocean beneath the electron layer than above . here",
    "@xmath270 ( @xmath271 ) is the number of radial nodes below ( above ) the electron capture transition layer .",
    "the thermal mode spectrum is split because the jump in density and @xmath272 across the transition layer creates an impedance mismatch , so that an impinging wave is partially reflected by the transition layer .",
    "this phenomenon is seen in so - called `` mode trapping '' in white dwarfs , in which thermal modes are `` trapped '' in the thin hydrogen or helium layers at the surface of the star ( winget , van horn & hansen 1981 ; brassard et al .",
    "these modes ( analogous to our upper thermal modes ) are believed to be preferentially excited .",
    "it may well be that something similar happens in our case . just like the trapped modes (  [ sec : trapmodes ] )",

    "we are currently investigating this as we consider excitation mechanisms .",
    "the thermal buoyancy in the upper atmosphere will most likely increase the frequency of the upper thermal modes .",
    "for example , strohmayer & lee ( 1996 ) investigated the seismology of an atmosphere accreting and burning in steady state and found thermal g - modes of frequency approximately @xmath273 for comparable accretion rates .",
    "the lower thermal modes are more or less confined to the deeper regions of the star .",
    "they do propagate upwards , but not enough to have their frequencies modified by any atmospheric physics .      to conclude our discussion of isothermal models , we show in figure [ fig : spec ] the spectrum of @xmath3 modes in an isothermal ocean with @xmath220 , @xmath274 and @xmath219 , our fiducial isothermal model .",

    "diagrams like the one in figure [ fig : spec ] help greatly in mode classification .",
    "the type of a given mode can be inferred more or less by where the extra node is placed as one jumps from mode to mode down the diagram .",
    "trapped modes have a new node added within the transition layer and this node remains there as one moves down the diagram .",
    "these nodes are marked with circles .",
    "a lower ( upper ) thermal mode has a new node placed at the bottom ( top ) of the transition layer and this node then moves downwards ( upwards ) in the ocean as one moves down the diagram .",
    "these nodes are marked with downward - pointing ( upward - pointing ) triangles .",
    "thus in figure [ fig : spec ] , the types of modes from top to bottom are d , u , t , l , u , l , t , l , u , t , l where d is for discontinuity , t is for trapped and u(l ) is for an upper ( lower ) thermal mode .",
    "this method of classifying nodes greatly eases the mode identification problem .",
    "in particular , it helps to distinguish between trapped and upper thermal modes , whose eigenfunctions may be very similar ( for example , compare figures [ fig : trap2 ] and [ fig : therm ] ) .",
    "it is not completely reliable however , as it is complicated by the mixing of mode eigenfunctions near avoided crossings , as we now discuss .",
    "it is by complete coincidence that the upper and lower thermal modes are at a similar frequency to the trapped modes .",
    "the frequencies of these modes depend differently on @xmath74 , @xmath243 , and @xmath109 , leading to `` avoided crossings '' whenever two mode frequencies try to cross and an accidental degeneracy arises .",
    "avoided crossings were found for non - radial oscillations in massive main sequence stars by osaki ( 1975 ) , and in the neutron star context by carroll et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , who found avoided crossings between g - modes and p - modes in their investigation of non - radial oscillations in the presence of strong magnetic fields ( @xmath275 ) .",

    "it shows how the frequency of the trapped mode changes due to changes in the structure of the boundary layer .",

    "the frequency splitting at the point of closest approach during a crossing is proportional to the `` overlap '' between the eigenfunctions of the two modes ( the off - diagonal matrix element in quantum mechanics ) .",
    "this may explain why an avoided crossing between an upper thermal mode and a trapped mode has a larger frequency splitting than an avoided crossing involving a lower thermal mode in figures [ fig : fnvsx ] and [ fig : fnvst ] .",
    "the `` overlap '' between upper thermal mode and trapped mode eigenfunctions is greater than between an upper thermal or trapped mode and a lower thermal mode .    during an avoided crossing",
    ", the mode eigenfunctions are mixed .",
    "we show this in figure [ fig : avoid ] in which we take the avoided crossing which is circled in figure [ fig : fnvst ] , and show the energy density of the two modes before , during and after the avoided crossing .",
    "this crossing is between a lower thermal mode and a trapped mode .",

    ", the two modes have exchanged characters .",
    "the lower frequency @xmath283 mode is now a trapped mode while the higher frequency @xmath282 mode is a lower thermal mode .",

    "up to this point we have presumed that the ocean is isothermal and considered the temperature to be a free parameter .",
    "we now construct non - isothermal models of the ocean by integrating the heat equation ( see brown & bildsten 1998 ) through the ocean .",
    "there are several sources of energy that contribute to the heat flux in the ocean .",
    "the first is the energy released when the neutrons from the hydrogen electron captures combine with the heavy nuclei , roughly @xmath287 mev per accreted nucleon .",
    "the second is the energy released as matter falls downwards ( or what is sometimes called `` compressional heating '' ) , @xmath288 . finally , there is energy released in the deep crust by nuclear electron captures and pycnonuclear reactions .",
    "most of this energy ( about an mev per accreted nucleon , haensel & zdunik , 1990a ) goes into the ns core and is lost via neutrinos , about 10% ( @xmath289 mev per accreted nucleon ) flows upwards through the ocean ( brown & bildsten 1998 ) . the total heat flux above the electron captures ( at",

    "as we show in this section ( in agreement with taam et al . 1996 ) , for typical values of @xmath15 and high accretion rates the region between the h / he burning layer and the hydrogen electron captures has a substantial temperature gradient .",
    "the other contributions to @xmath292 are typically not large enough to require a substantial temperature gradient ( bc95 ) at sub - eddington accretion rates , especially in the relativistic ocean underneath the hydrogen electron captures .    even when @xmath292 is known and nuclear reactions beyond electron capture are ignored - decays and the possibility of direct proton captures onto the nuclei when @xmath293 until we have better knowledge of the nuclear mix from the h / he burning .",
    "] , there are still additional uncertainties .",
    "one is the radiative opacity for this complicated mixture of elements . for pure iron at the depth where the hydrogen electron captures are occurring",
    ", the predominant heat transport mechanism would be electron conduction ( gudmundsson , pethick , & epstein 1983 ) .",
    "thus for simplicity , we neglect radiative heat transport and assume that all the heat is carried by electron conduction .",
    "for the conductive opacities , we use the results of yakovlev & urpin ( 1980 ) for electron - ion collisions , and the fit of potekhin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for electron - electron collisions .",
    "an additional uncertainty is the choice of temperature at the top of the ocean when the h / he burning is time dependent .",
    "this is because the separation between the electron capture region and the burning location is not far enough that a simple radiative - zero like solution applies , at least when @xmath294 at the electron capture depth .      in order to illustrate the effects of @xmath292",
    ", we show in figure [ fig : struct1 ] the temperature , hydrogen mass fraction and density as a function of column depth for models with @xmath295 and @xmath296 and @xmath297 ( from top to bottom in the @xmath50 and @xmath103 panels ) . in the density panel ,",

    "the flux at depths far below the electron capture region is @xmath304 .",
    "it is clear that , for these values of @xmath109 , the ocean is substantially hotter than if there were no hydrogen present . at this accretion rate ,",
    "the ocean is nearly isothermal below the hydrogen electron captures .",
    "most of the electron captures are post - threshold ( @xmath123 ) and occur 1530 days after the matter has arrived on the star .",

    "the other variables are the same as in the previous example .",
    "the enhanced flux due to the higher accretion rate ( see eq . [ [ eq : fluxcomp ] ] ) makes these models much hotter than the lower accretion rate ones .",
    "we may have slightly overestimated the temperature at these high @xmath74 s , since for @xmath308 , radiation may start to carry a significant fraction of the flux .",
    "many of the electron captures for the @xmath298 and @xmath219 cases occur pre - threshold ( @xmath92 ) . for the @xmath298 case ,",
    "one half of the hydrogen is depleted only 2.5 days after arriving on the ns .    at these high temperatures ( @xmath309 )",
    "it is important to consider neutrino cooling . using the formulae given by schinder et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , we find that , even for the hottest model we consider here ( @xmath310 , @xmath298 ) , neutrino cooling is unimportant at the depth of the hydrogen electron captures .",
    "it is certainly very important at greater depths however ( brown & bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "once @xmath311 , where @xmath312 is the neutrino cooling rate in @xmath313 , the temperature gradient changes direction and heat starts to flow into the core , a possibility we neglect for now . for @xmath310 ,",
    "this depth is @xmath314@xmath315 , near the bottom of the ocean . at higher @xmath74 s or @xmath109",
    "s neutrino cooling will become important at even lower column depths than this , although we stress again that at higher temperatures it becomes important to include the radiative opacity .",
    "how does the hydrogen electron capture transition layer compare to the isothermal cases we calculated previously ? figures [ fig : struct1 ] and [ fig : struct2 ] show that the transition layer itself is nearly isothermal .",
    "for example , even in the model with @xmath316 and @xmath298 , the temperature changes by a factor of only 10% across the transition layer .",
    "we thus characterise the structure of the layer by the temperature at , say , the place where one half of the hydrogen is depleted .",
    "for example , the hydrogen mass fraction @xmath103 in the non - isothermal model with @xmath310 and @xmath219 agrees to within 10% at each depth with an isothermal model with @xmath317 and the same @xmath74 and @xmath109 .",
    "these examples are intended to illustrate the large impact of the hydrogen electron captures ( taam et al .",
    "1996 ) on the deep structure of the neutron star .",
    "much more work is needed on the products of h / he burning before any definitive results can be stated .",
    "however , we hope we have strengthened the case of taam et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that even small amounts of residual hydrogen at high @xmath74 s can play an important role .",
    "we now describe the g - mode spectra of these non - isothermal models .",
    "the g - mode spectra of non - isothermal models of the ocean are easy to understand in the context of our study of isothermal ocean g - modes in  [ sec : modes ] .",
    "the g - mode spectra for the @xmath318 and @xmath319 models discussed above are shown in figure [ fig : doubleprop ] .",
    "the discontinuity mode frequency is insensitive to details of the structure of the transition layer and depends mainly on @xmath109 .",
    "it is given accurately by equation ( [ eq : fd ] ) .",
    "the lower thermal mode frequencies are set by the thermal buoyancy in the ocean below the transition layer , which is almost isothermal .",
    "the frequencies are almost the same as the lower thermal mode frequencies in an isothermal ocean with a temperature equal to that just below the transition layer .",
    "the discontinuity and lower thermal mode frequencies are insensitive to details of the upper boundary and thermal buoyancy above the transition layer .",
    "this is not true of the upper thermal and ( to a lesser extent ) the trapped modes .",
    "hence we expect that their frequencies will change as we extend our models into the upper atmosphere .",
    "also , we have not included radiative opacity which becomes important near the upper boundary and will reduce the temperature gradient there . in figure",
    "[ fig : doubleprop ] we show the predicted frequency increases due to temperature for the thermal modes ( @xmath280 scaling ) and due to @xmath109 for the trapped modes ( @xmath320 ) by vertical bars .",
    "these simple scalings predict the difference in frequencies between the left and right panels of figure [ fig : doubleprop ] fairly well .    as a further example",
    ", we have reconstructed one of the models of taam et al .",
    "they followed the time dependent evolution of models with accretion rates ranging from @xmath321@xmath322 times the eddington rate .",
    "all of these models had substantial residual hydrogen , ranging at the highest @xmath74 s from @xmath323@xmath324 .",
    "their neutron star had @xmath325 and @xmath326 and the initial heavy nucleus was iron ( @xmath327 ) .",
    "we chose model 8 from their tables 1 & 2 which has @xmath328 and @xmath329 , and varied our outer boundary condition until we matched their stated deep temperature .",
    "we then calculated the g - mode spectrum of this model .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : taam ] .",
    "we have exhaustively studied how the hydrogen electron capture layer expected in the rapidly accreting ( @xmath330 ) neutron stars affects the internal g - mode spectrum of these objects .",
    "the abrupt rise in density across the layer supports a density discontinuity mode ( see  [ sec : dismodes ] ) of frequency @xmath331 where @xmath217 and @xmath218 are the average change in the nuclei s charge and mass through the layer due to neutron captures and subsequent @xmath8-decays",
    ". the internal buoyancy due to the composition gradient within the electron capture boundary layer creates a new spectrum of `` trapped '' modes ( see  [ sec : trapmodes ] ) of frequency @xmath332 where @xmath30 is the number of nodes in the boundary layer and we have omitted the weak dependence on the accretion rate .",
    "there is also a set of thermal g - modes in the same frequency range as the trapped modes , which are separated by the density discontinuity into two distinct sets ( see  [ sec : thmodes ] ) .",
    "this work might eventually provide a natural explanation for some of the observed qpo s in accreting ns .",
    "indeed , if the neutron stars in the `` z '' sources were slowly rotating , the discontinuity ( trapped ) modes from the hydrogen electron capture layer would nicely overlap the freqencies of the qpos seen in the horizontal ( normal ) branch .",
    "the stable 40 hz qpo in the @xmath333 x - ray pulsar gro j1744 - 28 ( zhang et al .",
    "1996 ) is an intriguing one to consider , as the discontinuity mode is in the right frequency range and might have a small enough shear so that the @xmath334 field of this pulsar ( bildsten & brown 1997 ) will not affect the mode frequency .",
    "however , there is still much theoretical work to be done , from understanding how the modes are excited to how they modulate the x - ray flux .",
    "observational progress will come by identifying qpos with modes of different @xmath26 s , where the ratio of the mode frequencies are known .",
    "this is easiest when the neutron star is rotating slowly ( spin frequency @xmath335 hz ) , as one then merely looks for the @xmath336 scaling between qpo s that are ( ideally ) simultaneously present .",
    "the rapidly rotating case is more complicated as the angular eigenfunctions and dispersion relations are very different .",
    "as we discuss below , seismological progress can most likely be made only for those ns where the spin frequency has been measured during a type i burst ( see bildsten 1998b for a summary of those objects ) .",
    "an important question is how fast can the mode frequencies change ?",
    "the mode frequencies depend on internal conditions in the ocean , in particular on the temperature and @xmath109 . if a qpo was observed to change its frequency faster than the internal conditions in the ocean can change or if the dynamic range of the frequency was too great , this could rule out non - radial oscillations as a source of the periodicity .",
    "the discontinuity mode frequency and the trapped mode frequencies are sensitive to the residual hydrogen mass fraction , @xmath109 .",
    "this changes from one x - ray burst to another , which will result in layers of different @xmath109 being compressed towards the electron capture boundary layer .",
    "these layers are most likely rayleigh - taylor unstable and will mix , making the timescale for a large frequency change roughly the accretion time at the transition layer , days to weeks .",
    "the thermal modes and trapped modes are sensitive to the temperature in the ocean .",
    "the important timescale is the thermal time at the place where most of the mode energy resides , hours to days at the electron capture depth .",
    "thus the upper thermal mode frequencies will change faster than the lower thermal mode frequencies . as we noted in ",
    "[ sec : modes ] , since the thermal time is shorter than the accretion time , the change in the mode frequencies on a short timescale will be determined by the change in the thermal buoyancy and not the structure of the transition layer .",
    "there is good reason to suspect that these neutron stars are rapidly rotating , as the prolonged accumulation of material at this rate will most likely spin up the star .",
    "the coherent periodicities during type i x - ray bursts seem to indicate 250500 hz spin frequencies , which are much greater than the g - mode frequencies , but still small compared to the breakup frequency @xmath337 ( @xmath338 khz for a @xmath339 km star ) .",
    "when @xmath340 , the unperturbed star is spherical and the centrifugal force can be neglected , in which case the primary difference in the momentum equations is the coriolis force . as a result ,",
    "the g - mode frequencies depart significantly from the @xmath341 scaling ( papaloizou & pringle 1978 ) .",
    "buc96 made progress on this problem within what is called the `` traditional approximation '' , where the radial and transverse momentum equations separate and the resulting angular equation must be solved to find the angular eigenfunctions ( no longer @xmath342 s ) and transverse eigenvalues @xmath343 ( no longer @xmath344 ) .",
    "the radial equations are identical to the non - rotating case , so that if @xmath345 is the eigenfrequency for the @xmath3 mode of a _ non - rotating _ star , then the oscillation frequency ( in the rotating frame ) at arbitrary spin is @xmath346 .",
    "these are then transferred into the observer s inertial frame via @xmath347 , so that going from our non - rotating results to the rotating star is straightforward .",
    "however , nearly any frequency can be predicted in the absence of prior knowledge of the spin frequency , as the retrograde modes cover a large frequency range as the ns spin is varied .",
    "robust predictions are , however , possible for those nss where the spin frequency is known from a type i burst , by far the best case to date is 4u  1728 - 34 ( strohmayer et al . 1996 ; strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ) which has @xmath348 hz . for a known spin frequency , buc96 and bildsten et .",
    "1998 ) have shown that one can predict the observed frequencies as a function of the internal conditions ( e.g. @xmath50 or @xmath109 ) .",
    "bildsten et al .",
    "( 1998 ) asked how the observed frequencies for different angular eigenmodes would change as the internal conditions change .",
    "they found that the prograde modes are all at relatively high frequencies , near a khz .",
    "however , these mode frequencies did not exhibit the large dynamic range of the observed khz qpos .",
    "the splitting for some of the prograde modes was found to be nearly constant , but _ not _ equal to the spin frequency .",
    "other prograde modes had varying differences and could potentially be applicable to those khz qpo s that do not have constant frequency separation ( sco x-1 , van der klis et al .",
    "1997 , 4u  1608 - 52 , mendez et al .",
    "1998 ) . of particular interest",
    "were the retrograde modes that appeared at @xmath349 .",
    "these showed a large dynamic range for only a small change in internal conditions .",
    "bildsten et al .",
    "( 1998 ) thus pointed to the possibility of explaining some of the qpos seen in the @xmath10 hz range from 4u  1728 - 34 and other atoll sources .",
    "bildsten et al . (",
    "1998 ) pointed out that confirming non - radial pulsations in a star with a previously measured spin frequency can come by identifying a measured low - frequency qpo with a particular value of the non - rotating frequency and then searching in the data for the higher frequency prograde modes .",
    "such an exercise has yet to be carried out and could potentially bear fruit , as few fourier bins would need to be searched .",
    "the dispersion relations are complicated enough that such exercises can only be done in concert with theory . at present ,",
    "theoretical predictions can most likely be done at the 10% level .",
    "further theoretical work to include general relativistic effects might be needed for the very rapidly rotating stars ( @xmath350 ) before such an exercise could be carried out in detail , say at the 1% level .",

    "it is important to carry out some of these calculations , as there is a possible large - scale instability that might develop underneath the layer .",
    "after all the electron captures have occurred , the nuclei will , on average , be neutron rich .",
    "these nuclei advect downwards and eventually @xmath8-decay ( they typically are not fermi blocked ) on timescales much longer than days .",
    "this may cause a density inversion as the released electrons will decrease the density , possibly leading to a rayleigh - taylor instability underneath the hydrogen electron capture zone .",

    "we are presently working on the internal excitation and damping of the adiabatic modes we have presented here .",
    "following the work of sl96 , we are starting by considering the excitation of the upper thermal modes , trapped modes and discontinuity modes by the h / he burning layers .",
    "our new understanding of the mode structure will modify the competition between excitation in the burning layers and damping elsewhere in the star that they found .",
    "we hope to show that a sub - set of the infinite spectrum of oscillations we have found here will be excited . finding the steady - state amplitude of the oscillation is beyond the scope of these calculations since it would require going beyond linear order .    how can a mode modulate the x - ray luminosity ?",
    "there are a few ways one can imagine .",
    "one pointed out by bildsten et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the rapidly rotating case is from direct interaction with the accretion disk , as the g - modes are confined to a narrow equatorial band that would lie in the same plane as the accretion disk .",
    "if the ns does not lie inside the last stable orbit , then the disk should run directly into the surface , allowing for potential periodic modulation of the accretion environment .",
    "an alternative is to invoke a weak magnetic field .",
    "the mode frequencies are not modified when @xmath351 ( bc95 ) , but the thermal modes have tremendous shear and will thus , at high altitudes , change their nature ( carroll et al .",
