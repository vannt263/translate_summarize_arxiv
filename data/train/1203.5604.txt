    "we are interested in topics related to the pointwise convergence of fourier series and allied issues @xcite .",
    "we work in the vector - valued setting , so that our banach spaces are of umd type : martingale differences are unconditional in these spaces @xcite . in addition , following a well - known theme in this subject , this paper concentrates on walsh models of objects with a more natural formulation in the fourier setting .",
    "the walsh setting allows one to avoid certain technicalities in the arguments .",
    "the martingale structure is also easier to identify , clarifying the role of umd in these questions .",
    "two of us @xcite have established an extension of the walsh model of the carleson theorem on fourier series to all known examples of umd spaces .",
    "this extension is phrased in terms of a notion of _ tile type _ , a closely related notion of _ quartile type _ being defined below .",
    "very crudely , tile type is between @xmath1 and infinity , and measures how close the umd space is to a hilbert space .",
    "it was shown that hilbert space has tile type @xmath1 and , that every umd space which is the complex interpolation space between a hilbert space and some other worse umd space , has tile type @xmath2 .",
    "all known examples of umd spaces are complex interpolation spaces of this form and , thus , have finite tile type .",
    "in particular , the space @xmath3 has tile type @xmath4 .",
    "mere finiteness of tile type is sufficient for the carleson theorem .",
    "parcet - soria - xu have established a weaker result @xcite valid for all umd spaces .",
    "the validity of carleson s theorem on an arbitrary umd space is open .    following the results of @xcite ,",
    "there has been a variety of results established that depend upon the ideas and techniques of carleson s theorem .",
    "the bilinear hilbert transform is perhaps the first among equals among these results , and it , again in the walsh setting as identified by @xcite , is the main object of present concern . in the fourier setting , the bilinear hilbert transform is the operator given by @xmath5 we show that there are meaningful extensions of the bilinear hilbert transform to a umd setting .",
    "moreover , using the notion of quartile type , we find that there is an intricate relationship between quartile type and positive results for the vector valued quartile operator .",
    "we require that the umd spaces are ` sufficiently close ' to a hilbert space , as measured by the quartile type .",
    "these results are made precise below .",
    "in addition , the banach spaces we consider need _ not _ be lattices , a frequent assumption that simplifies certain proofs .    to take advantage of the symmetries of the operator ,",
    "the quartile operator is frequently studied as a trilinear form @xmath6 , a sum of a product of three rank - one wave - packet projections .",
    "it is extended below in these terms .",
    "take three umd spaces , @xmath7 , and a fixed trilinear form @xmath8 .",
    "the trilinear form @xmath6 is then a sum of @xmath9 evaluated on certain wave - packet projections of @xmath10 .",
    "a natural case of the trilinear form is to take @xmath11 and @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 , with the inner product denoting the duality pairing between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is the _ duality trilinear form_.    in the scalar case , an important role is played by the set of inequalities of the locally square integrable case . in the umd setting , this is played by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the quartile type of the space @xmath18 .",
    "we find it necessary to assume that @xmath19 , which is the quantification of the triple of umd spaces being sufficiently close to hilbert spaces . with the duality trilinear form",
    ", this condition reduces to the quartile type of @xmath20 being @xmath21 , that is we can only prove results for an @xmath3 valued quartile operator in the case @xmath22 . again in the scalar case , the bilinear hilbert transform satisfies a range of inequalities that permit one to break the duality in the pair of indices in question .",
    "there are similar phenomena in the vector valued case but the inequalities are more intricate and become restrictive as @xmath23 approaches one . with the duality trilinear form , there is a dichotomy between the cases of @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 .    with precise definitions to follow ,",
    "one of the main results of this paper is below .",
    "[ t.main-local ] for @xmath26 , let @xmath27 be a umd banach space of quartile type @xmath28 .",
    "suppose that the quartile types satisfy @xmath29 and that the exponents @xmath30 and @xmath31 satisfy @xmath32 then the bilinear quartile operator extends to a bounded operator from @xmath33 into @xmath34 , that is @xmath35    theorem [ t.main-local ] contains the local @xmath36 estimates for the quartile operator and can be thought of as the vector - valued analogue of the local @xmath37-theorem for the scalar bilinear hilbert transform @xcite .",
    "a full set of inequalities is discussed in the concluding section of the paper . in particular , theorem",
    "[ t.main-local ] is a special case of our main result , theorem [ thm : main ] , which also contains estimates for the quartile operator ` below ' the quartile types .",
