    "one of the goals of ultrarelativistic heavy ion experiments is to study the quark - gluon substructure of nuclear matter and the possibility of a phase transition from hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp)@xcite at extremely high energy densities . unlike heavy ion collisions at the existing ags / bnl and sps / cern energies ,",
    "most of the physical processes occurring at very early times in the violent collisions of heavy nuclei at rhic / bnl and the proposed lhc / cern energies involve hard or semihard parton scatterings@xcite which will result in enormous amount of jet production and can be described in terms of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the concept of jets and their association with hard parton scatterings has been well established in hadronic interactions and they have been proven to play a major role in every aspect of @xmath10 collisions at cern @xmath11 and fermilab tevatron energies@xcite .",
    "experimentally , jets are identified as hadronic clusters whose transverse energy @xmath12 can be reconstructed from the calorimetrical study@xcite of the events . however , when the transverse energy of a jet becomes smaller , @xmath13 gev , it is increasingly difficult to resolve it from the underlying background@xcite , though theoretically , we would expect that hard parton scatterings must continue to lower transverse momentum .",
    "we usually refer to those as minijets whose transverse energy are too low to be resolved experimentally but the associated parton scattering processes may still be calculable via pqcd .",
    "assuming independent production , it has been shown that the multiple minijets production is important in @xmath14 interactions to account for the increase of total cross section@xcite and the violation of koba - nielsen - olesen ( kno ) scaling of the charged multiplicity distributions@xcite .    in high energy heavy ion collisions ,",
    "minijets have been estimated@xcite to produce 50% ( 80% ) of the transverse energy in central heavy ion collisions at rhic ( lhc ) energies . while not resolvable as distinct jets , they would lead to a wide variety of correlations , as in @xmath0 or @xmath14 collisions , among observables such as multiplicity , transverse momentum , strangeness , and fluctuations that compete with the expected signatures of a qgp .",
    "therefore , it is especially important to calculate these background processes .",
    "furthermore , the calculation could also provide the initial condition to address the issues of thermalization and equilibration of a quark gluon plasma . in this respect ,",
    "the interactions of high @xmath3 jets inside the dense medium is also interesting since the variation of jet quenching phenomenon may serve as one of the signatures of the qgp transition@xcite .    to provide a theoretical laboratory for studying jets in high - energy nuclear interactions and testing the proposed signatures such as jet quenching@xcite , we have developed a monte carlo model , hijing ( heavy ion jet interaction generator)@xcite , which combines a qcd inspired model for jet production with the lund model@xcite for jet fragmentation .",
    "the formulation of hijing was guided by the lund fritiof@xcite and dual parton model@xcite for soft @xmath15 reactions at intermediate energies ( @xmath16 gev / nucleon ) and the successful implementation of pqcd processes in pythia@xcite model for hadronic collisions .",
    "hijing is designed mainly to explore the range of possible initial conditions that may occur in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "to study the nuclear effects , we also included nuclear shadowing@xcite of parton structure functions and a schematic model of final state interaction of high @xmath3 jets in terms of an effective energy loss parameter , @xmath4@xcite . at @xmath0 and @xmath14 level",
    ", hijing also made an important effort to address the interplay between low @xmath3 nonperturbative physics and the hard pqcd processes .",
    "this monte carlo model has been tested extensively against data on @xmath17 over a wide energy range , @xmath18 - 1800 gev and @xmath19 , @xmath20 collisions at moderate energies @xmath21 gev / n @xcite . however , in this version of hijing program , the space - time development of final state interaction among produced partons@xcite and hadrons was not considered .    in this paper , we present a detailed description of the monte carlo program together with a brief summary of physical motivations . since the program uses subroutines of pythia to generate the kinetic variables for each hard scattering and the associated radiations , and jetset for string fragmentation , we refer readers to the original publications@xcite for the description of these programs .",
    "the physics involved in hijing has been discussed extensively@xcite .",
    "this paper is intended to be a documented reference for the overall structure and detailed description of the program .",
    "the organization of the paper is as the following . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review of the qcd inspired model for multiple jets production and soft interaction in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the nuclear effects on jet production and fragmentation are discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 will give a detailed description of the program .",
    "finally in section 5 we will give instructions on how to use the program and some simple examples are provided .",
    "the qcd inspired model is based on the assumption of independent production of multiple minijets .",
    "it determines the number of minijets per nucleon - nucleon collisions . for each hard or semihard interaction",
    "the kinetic variables of the scattered partons are determined by calling pythia@xcite subroutines .",
    "the scheme for the accompanying soft interactions is similar to fritiof model@xcite with some difference in the successive soft excitation of the leading quarks or diquarks and @xmath3 transfer involved .",
    "since minijet production is dominated by gluon scatterings , we assume that quark scatterings only involve valence quarks and restrict the subsequent hard processes to gluon - gluon scatterings .",
    "simplification is also made for the color flow in the case of multiple jet production .",
    "produced gluons are ordered in their rapidities and then connected with their parent valence quarks or diquarks to form string systems .",
    "finally , fragmentation subroutine of jetset is called for hadronization .      in pqcd",
    ", the cross section of hard parton scatterings can be written as@xcite @xmath22 where the summation runs over all parton species , @xmath23,@xmath24 are the rapidities of the scattered partons and @xmath25,@xmath26 are the fractions of momentum carried by the initial partons and they are related by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . a factor , @xmath30 accounts roughly for the higher order corrections .",

    "we shall follow the equations listed above to simulate multiple jets production at the level of nucleon - nucleon collisions in hijing monte carlo program .",
    "once the number of hard scatterings is determined , we then use pythia to generate the kinetic variables of the scattered partons and the initial and final state radiations .",
    "because the differential cross section of jet production decreases for several orders in magnitude from small to large @xmath3 , we often have to trigger on jet production with specified @xmath3 in order to increase the simulation efficiency .",
    "the triggering can then change the probability of multiple minijet production and thus the whole event structure .",
    "in particular , such rare processes of large @xmath3 scatterings most often occur when the impact parameter of nucleon - nucleon collision is small so that the partonic overlap is large . at small impact parameters",

[ eq : sjet3 ] ) when @xmath57 .",
    "summing over @xmath58 leads to the expected total probability for having at least one jet with @xmath59 , @xmath60    since @xmath55 differs from @xmath56 , the triggering of a particular jet therefore has changed the production rates of the other jets in the same event .",
    "this triggering effect is especially significant when we consider large @xmath53 .",
    "it becomes more probable to produce multiple jets due to the triggering on a high @xmath3 jet . in hijing , we implement eq .",
    "[ eq : trigjet4 ] by simulating two poisson - like multiple jet distributions with inclusive cross sections @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "we demand that the second one must have at least one jet and convolute the two together",
    ". the resultant distribution will be the triggered distribution .      besides the processes with large transverse momentum transfer which are described by pqcd , there are also many small @xmath3 exchanges or soft interactions between two colliding hadrons .",
    "we adopt a variant of the multiple string phenomenological model for such soft interactions in which multiple soft gluon exchanges between valence quarks or diquarks lead to longitudinal string - like excitations .",
    "gluon production from hard processes and soft radiations are included as kinks in the strings .",
    "the strings then hadronize according to lund jetset7.2 fragmentation scheme .    in the center of mass frame of two colliding nucleons with initial light - cone momenta @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ", the excited strings will have final momenta @xmath65 after a collective momentum exchange @xmath66 .",
    "the soft interactions by definition have small transverse momentum transfer , @xmath67 gev/@xmath51 , while large effective light - come momentum@xcite exchange can give rise to two excited strings with large invariant masses .",
    "defining @xmath68 the excited masses of the two strings will be @xmath69 respectively .",
    "if we require that the excited string masses must have a minimum value @xmath70 , then the kinematically allowed region of @xmath71 will be @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the condition for the above equations to be valid is @xmath74 this is the minimum colliding energy we will require to produce two excited strings which can be fragmented into hadrons by the lund string fragmentation model . we have chosen @xmath70 to be 1.5 gev/@xmath75 in all our calculations involving nucleon collisions . when the energy is smaller than what eq .",
    "[ eq : smin ] requires , we assume that the interaction can be described by other processes like single diffractive or @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 , @xmath78 in cases of pions and kaons collisions ) excitation .",
    "however , we usually do not expect that the model is still valid at such low energies .",
    "[ eq : smin ] also serves as to determine the maximum @xmath3 that the strings can obtain from the soft interactions .",
    "if hard interactions are involved , the kinetic boundary of string formation is reduced by the hard scatterings .    in order to best fit the rapidity distributions of charged particles , we choose the following distributions for light - cone momentum transfer , @xmath79 for nucleons and @xmath80^{1/4 } } ,                  \\label{eq : xdistr2}\\ ] ] for mesons , where @xmath81 gev is a cutoff for computational purpose with little theoretical consequences in the model . for single - diffractive events whose",
    "cross section can be obtained from an empirical parametrization@xcite , we fix the mass of the diffractive hadron to be its own or its vector state excitation and find the mass of the single excited string according to the well known distribution , @xmath82 which lead to the experimentally observed@xcite mass distribution @xmath83 of the disassociated hadrons .    before fragmentation",
    ", the excited strings are also assumed to have soft gluon radiation induced by the soft interactions .",
    "such soft gluon radiation can be approximated by color dipole model as has been successfully implemented in ariadne monte carlo program@xcite . in hijing , we adopted subroutines ar3jet and arorie from fritiof 1.7@xcite to simulate the dipole radiation which appear as gluon kinks in the string .",
    "since minijets are treated explicitly via pqcd , we limit the transverse momentum of the radiated gluons below the minijet cutoff @xmath84 gev/@xmath51 .",
    "the limitation on the transverse momentum is a characteristic feature of induced bremsstrahlung due to soft exchanges@xcite .",
    "the invariant mass cutoff for strings to radiate is fixed at @xmath85 gev/@xmath75 by default .      as described in the above , hard or semihard scatterings in our model",
    "have at least transverse momentum of @xmath86 .",
    "the value of @xmath32 we use is the result of a model dependent fit of calculated cross sections to the experimental values .",
    "one can imagine that the corresponding soft interactions , which are characterized by inclusive cross section @xmath38 , will depend on @xmath32 . for such processes",
    ", we include an extra low @xmath87 transfer to the valence quarks or diquarks at string end points .",
    "we assume a distribution for the @xmath3 kick which extrapolates smoothly to the high @xmath3 regime of hard scatterings but vary more slowly for @xmath88 , @xmath89 where @xmath81 gev/@xmath51 . in practice , the distribution will follow a gaussian form when @xmath90 .",
    "since diquarks are composites , we also assume that @xmath3 transfer to a diquark is relatively suppressed by a form factor with a scale of 1 gev/@xmath51 .",
    "this @xmath3 kick to the quarks or diquarks during the soft interactions will provide an extra increase in transverse momentum to produced hadrons in order to fit the experimental data at low energies@xcite .",
    "otherwise , the transverse momentum from pair production in the default lund string fragmentation is not enough to account for the higher @xmath3 tail in low energy @xmath0 collisions .",
    "to include the nuclear effects on jet production and fragmentation , we also consider the emc@xcite effect of the parton structure functions in nuclei and the interaction of the produced jets with the excited nuclear matter in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we assume that a nucleus - nucleus collision can be decomposed into binary nucleon - nucleon collisions which generally involve the wounded nucleons . in a string picture ,",
    "the wounded nucleons become strings excited along the beam direction . at high energy ,",
    "the excited strings are assumed to interact again like the ordinary nucleon - nucleon collisions before they fragment .",
    "unlike fritiof model , we allow an excited string to be de - excited within the kinematic limits in the subsequent collisions . the binary approximation can also be applied to rare hard scatterings which involve only independent pairs of partons .",
    "the probability for a given parton to suffer multiple high @xmath3 scatterings is small and is not implemented in the current version of the program .",
    "we employ a three - parameter wood - saxon nuclear density to compute the number of binary collisions at a given impact parameter .    for each one of these binary collisions , we use the eikonal formalism as given in section  [ sec : jet1 ] to determine the probability of collision , elastic or inelastic and the number of jets it produces .",
    "after simulation of hard processes , the energy of the scattered partons is subtracted from the nucleon and the remaining energy is used in the soft interaction as in ordinary soft nucleon - nucleon collisions . the excited string system minus",
    "the scattered partons suffers further collisions according to the geometrical probability .",
    "we assign one of the two scattered partons per hard scattering to each participating nucleon or they may form an independent single ( @xmath91 ) string system . after all binary collisions are processed , we then connect the scattered partons in the associated nucleons with the corresponding valence quarks and diquarks to form string systems .",
    "the strings are then fragmented into particles .",
    "one of the most important nuclear effects in relativistic heavy ion collisions is the nuclear modification of parton structure functions .",
    "it has been observed@xcite that the effective number of quarks and antiquarks in a nucleus is depleted in the low region of @xmath92 .",
    "though gluon shadowing has not been studied experimentally , we will assume that the shadowing effect for gluons and quarks is the same .",
    "we also neglect the qcd evolution of the shadowing effect in the current version .",
    "there is no experimental evidence for significant @xmath93 dependence of the nuclear effect on the quark structure functions .",
    "however , theoretical study@xcite shows that gluon shadowing may evolve with @xmath93 .    at this stage , the experimental data unfortunately can not fully determine the @xmath94 dependence of the shadowing .",
    "we will follow the @xmath94 dependence as proposed in ref.@xcite and use the following parametrization , @xmath95\\nonumber\\\\                  & & -[\\alpha_a-\\frac{1.08(a^{1/3}-1)}{\\ln(a+1)}\\sqrt{x } ]                          e^{-x^2/x_0 ^ 2},\\label{eq : shadow}\\\\          \\alpha_a&=&0.1(a^{1/3}-1),\\label{eq : shadow1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "[ eq : shadow ] determines the shadowing for @xmath99 with the most important nuclear dependence , while the rest gives the overall nuclear effect on the structure function in @xmath100 with some very slow @xmath94 dependence .",
    "this parametrization can fit the overall nuclear effect on the quark structure function in the small and medium @xmath92 region@xcite .    to take into account of the impact parameter dependence , we assume that the shadowing effect @xmath98 is proportional to the longitudinal dimension of the nucleus along the straight trajectory of the interacting nucleons .",
    "we thus parametrize @xmath98 in eq .",
    "[ eq : shadow ] as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the transverse distance of the interacting nucleon from its nucleus center and @xmath103 is the radius of the nucleus . for a sharp sphere nucleus with overlap function @xmath104 ,",
    "the averaged @xmath105 is @xmath106 .",
    "because the rest of eq .  [ eq : shadow ] has a very slow @xmath94 dependence , we will only consider the impact parameter dependence of @xmath98 .",
    "after all , most of the jet productions occur in the small @xmath92 region where only shadowing is important .    to simplify the calculation during the monte carlo simulation",

    "another important nuclear effect on the jet production in heavy ion collisions is the final state integration . in high energy",
    "heavy ion collisions , a dense hadronic or partonic matter must be produced in the central region . because this matter can extend over a transverse dimension of at least @xmath103 , jets with large @xmath3 from hard scatterings have to traverse this hot environment .",
    "for the purpose of studying the property of the dense matter created during the nucleus - nucleus collisions , it is important to investigate the interaction of jets with the matter and the energy loss they suffer during their journey out .",
    "it is estimated@xcite that the gluon bremsstrahlung induced by soft interaction dominate the energy loss mechanism .",

    "the induced radiation is simulated by transferring a part of the jet energy @xmath126 as a gluon kink to the other string which the jet interacts with .",
    "we continue the procedure until the jet is out of the whole excited system or when the jet energy is smaller than a cutoff below which a jet can not loss energy any more .",
    "we take this cutoff as the same as the cutoff @xmath32 for jet production . to determine how many and which excited strings could interact with the jet",

    "<S> a parametrized parton distribution function inside a nucleus is used to take into account parton shadowing . </S>",
    "<S> jet quenching is modeled by an assumed energy loss @xmath4 of partons traversing the produced dense matter . </S>",
    "<S> a simplest color configuration is assumed for the multiple jet system and lund jet fragmentation model is used for the hadronization . </S>",
