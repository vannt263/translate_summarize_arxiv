    "in papers [ 1 - 2 ] we proposed a new approach for solving nonlinear differential equations which utilizes two main principles of storing the numbers in the digital computers : 1 ) the numbers are represented as the segments of a power series ; 2 ) there is a digit shifting procedure . in each level",
    "the numerical solution is presented as the segment of a series in the powers of the step @xmath0 of the independent variable .",
    "the digit shifting procedure is applied in each level to change the values of the coefficients of the terms so each coefficient would not exceed @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown that the digit shifting can produce quasi - random numbers which have been used to exclude the intermediate levels of computations .",
    "this method can provide a solution in the explicit form ( as a computer provides a solution in the numerical form , after executing many intermediate and `` hidden '' operations ) .",
    "some examples of solving different nonlinear equations and simple systems have been demonstrated .    in the present paper we consider nonlinear systems which have the physical sense .",
    "namely the van der pol equation ( equivalent to a system of two ode ) and the well - known lorenz system of the three ode .",
    "we prove that for ode where the right hand part is a polynomial of degree @xmath2 , it is sufficient to retain the terms up to @xmath2 plus the order of accuracy of the numerical method .",
    "in most cases the nonlinear differential equations can not be solved analytically , but usually they can be solved numerically instead .",
    "however one of the main distinctions between analytical and numerical solutions is that the numerical solution is not conceivable without a computer  a physical device which performs routine computations .",
    "consider the following cauchy problem : @xmath3    let there be a @xmath4-th order explicit finite - difference scheme which approximates the solution , it can be written as : @xmath5 where @xmath0 is a step of the independent variable @xmath6 , @xmath7 is determined by function a @xmath8 and by the chosen finite difference method .",
    "note that for the first order method @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath8 .    when solving the numerical solution the computer acts as a black box , which runs an algorithm and after performing a large amount of steps of the algorithm provides a result as the array of numbers .",
    "the computer operations are fairly simple , but due to nonlinearity ( in general ) of the problem under consideration it is difficult to understand how the values will be changed after few operations .    from a certain point of view",
    "the computer solves the numerical analog of the analytical problem , and instead of the analysis and analytical computations it executes an algorithm .",
    "but on the other hand we can consider a numerical solution as the independent problem and search for an analytical solution ( or approximation ) for this particular problem .",
    "first , we will formalize the numbers representation in computers .",
    "the following aspects are essential : 1 ) the numbers are stored as the segments of the power series , 2 ) there is the digit shifting procedure which shifts a part of the value to the left digit .",
    "the power series in powers of @xmath0 can be obtained from the explicit finite differece scheme and the taylor expansion .",
    "let @xmath7 is infinitely differentiable function with bounded derivatives .",
    "then @xmath10 can be represented by the series in powers of @xmath0 : @xmath11    this follows from the taylor expansion of @xmath12 at @xmath13 : @xmath14    using this expansion we find @xmath15 .",
    "comparison of the coefficients in the sequential layers gives the following recurrent relations : @xmath16 and so on .",
    "the expansion of @xmath10 can not be truncated after a fixed number of terms because the truncated value will be of a greater order than the accuracy of the finite - difference method , and such a solution would diverge .",
    "let us construct a procedure of redistribution of the values of the coefficients @xmath17 so that    \\1 ) the value of @xmath10 remains unchanged ;    \\2 ) for any @xmath18 : @xmath19 .",
    "consider the following example .",
    "let @xmath20 and in @xmath21-th layer @xmath10 is written as follows : @xmath22 let after applying the finite - difference formula we got @xmath15 @xmath23 the coefficient at @xmath24 is greater than @xmath25 which leads to the eventual divergence .",
    "in order to avoid this we apply the digit shifting procedure .",
    "it can be done in different ways , but following to how we do it in common positional numeral systems , we take @xmath26 from @xmath27 and add @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( at @xmath30 ) : @xmath31 as we see , the value is not changed , but the structure of the value is changed .",
    "the digit shifting procedure allows us to hold the values when applying the numerical scheme which would otherwise be truncated .",
    "now we will show how the shifting procedure can be constructed . to guarantee that series is convergent",
    "we will restrain the absolute values of @xmath17 by @xmath1 .",
    "let there is a piecewise function @xmath32 that maps @xmath33 to the segment @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "consider a function @xmath35 we will refer to it as _ the shifting function_. in fig .",
    "[ shifters ] few possible choices of @xmath36 are shown .        consider the expansion @xmath10 where the absolute values of the coefficients can be greater than @xmath1 : @xmath37 let @xmath32 is the shifting function .",
    "it should be applied for each coefficient .",
    "let us consider its application for @xmath38-th coefficient .",
    "first of all we must add to it the value shifted from @xmath39-th coefficient , denote it as @xmath40 .",
    "let us add and subtract the value @xmath41 @xmath42 since @xmath43 , we imply the following : @xmath44 @xmath45    the shifting procedure guarantees that the absolute values of the coefficients of the power series are limited by the value @xmath1 which implies that the series may be truncated .",
    "consider series . now , using the digit shifting procedure , we will construct the representation of the solution .",
    "let us denote @xmath46 as @xmath47 and from @xmath48 and on as @xmath49 .",
    "since all coefficients @xmath50 are limited by @xmath1 , we conclude that @xmath51 thus @xmath52 is of order of @xmath0 .",
    "let us show that @xmath53 can be approximated by @xmath54 with error @xmath55 . consider the difference @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 , let us expand @xmath53 at @xmath47 @xmath58 since the derivatives of @xmath8 are bounded , we obtain that @xmath59 .",
    "this yields @xmath60 .",
    "let us expand @xmath61 at @xmath62 : @xmath63    consider the first order explicit finite - difference scheme for : @xmath64 combining and we obtain : @xmath65 then we get : @xmath66    if the right hand part of ode is a polynomial of degree @xmath67 , then for the first order explicit scheme @xmath68 .",
    "a proof follows from the fact that the derivatives of the order of @xmath69 and greater equals zero for a polynomial of degree @xmath67 .",
    "this yields that for any @xmath70 in the corresponding term equals zero , thus can be truncated at term with @xmath71 .",
    "consider a problem .",
    "let there is a solution @xmath72 as we have already shown the convergence is achieved by applying the shifting functions to constrain the coefficients . but instead of applying the shifting function to each coefficient , we can split the segment of the series into two segments : @xmath73 @xmath74 this allows to write the solution as the following sum : @xmath75 where @xmath4 is the order of approximation and @xmath76 is the number of retained terms .",
    "these two parts are linked together via a single value shifting .",
    "this approach simplifies constructing the solution .",
    "for example , @xmath4 could be equal to @xmath77 and @xmath76 could be the number greater , say @xmath29 , in this case the first term , namely @xmath78 describes the regular part of the solution and the second term @xmath79 would be the quasirandom part .",
    "let the shifting function is @xmath80 .",
    "consider @xmath81 : @xmath82 this expression conforms to the congruent random number generator formula : @xmath83    we assume that coefficients @xmath84 are the uniformly distributed random integer numbers .",
    "therefore the solution can be written as a sum of two parts :    deterministic : @xmath85 ,    random : @xmath86 .",
    "these two parts are linked together by the value @xmath87 .",
    "if the probabilities of the values of @xmath87 are known , then we can exclude the intermediate layers of independent variable on which the deterministic part remains unchanged .",
    "let us see how the method of computer analogy can be used to construct linear analytical approximations which in certain cases can be used to get qualitative ( or maybe in some cases the quantitative ) information about the solution .",
    "let @xmath88 , thus the solution will contain only two terms . denote them as @xmath89 and @xmath90 , thus : @xmath91 using we get the value in the next layer ( let @xmath92 ) : @xmath93 now we apply the digit shifting procedure : @xmath94 let @xmath95 .",
    "we will use this shifting function by default .",
    "the choice of this function is based on the fact that for @xmath96 it follows that @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath15 can be written as follows : @xmath98.\\ ] ] since @xmath92 , then possible values for @xmath99 are @xmath100 .    comparing the coefficients on sequential layers we get the following reccurent relations : @xmath101",
    "we see that @xmath102 can be changed only when a non - zero digit shifting occures .",
    "suppose that for several sequential layers @xmath103 equals to zero , so there are no values shifted to coefficient @xmath102 .",
    "this implyes that for these layers @xmath104 is constant and @xmath105 grows linearly . when the digit shifting takes place the coefficient @xmath106 changes , that leads to changing of angular coefficient of @xmath105 which is @xmath107 .",
    "when @xmath105 reaches @xmath108 , @xmath99 will become @xmath109 or @xmath77 , this will change @xmath102 and consequently the angular coefficient @xmath9 .",
    "let us now obtain the formulae for constructing the linear approximation .",
    "let @xmath110 corresponds to some moment @xmath111 .",
    "suppose @xmath112 equal to zero , so there are no shiftings in the first @xmath113 layers , and there is a shift in @xmath114 layer .",
    "then we imply that @xmath115 for any @xmath2 that @xmath116 .",
    "this means that due to the chosen shifting function for any @xmath2 such that @xmath116 @xmath97 because the absolute value of the argument is less than @xmath1 .",
    "this yields the reccurent relation for @xmath105 can be written as follows : @xmath117 this relation can be written explicitly : @xmath118 by substituting @xmath119 to @xmath120 we get : @xmath121 notice that @xmath122 is the value of time @xmath123 , thus : @xmath124 this relation holds true for any value of @xmath6 such that @xmath125 , thus @xmath126 now we will show the value @xmath113 can be obtained .",
    "denote @xmath127 and consider two cases : @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the first case implies that @xmath105 is linearly grows , the second one implies that @xmath105 is linearly descends .",
    "let @xmath130 then the digit shifting occure when @xmath131 : @xmath132 thus @xmath133 for @xmath113 we will use the smallest integer value of the right hand part , so .",
    "by analogy we get the following value for @xmath113 in a case @xmath134 : @xmath135 .",
    "and now we need to show how to get the new values of @xmath106 and @xmath136 after the shifting of the digit .",
    "denote them as @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "if digit shifting is triggered , @xmath105 is changed according to the shifting function , so : @xmath139 and @xmath102 is changed on @xmath77 or @xmath109 according to @xmath9 : @xmath140",
    "consider the following cauchy problem ( see [ 2 ] for details ) : @xmath141 we will use the explicit first - order scheme and represent @xmath142 and @xmath143 as the segments of the series in powers of @xmath0 .",

    "theorem 1 implies that for @xmath154 and @xmath155 it is sufficient to retain terms until @xmath24 and @xmath156 respectively .",
    "we will retain only the terms up to @xmath30 for the both functions : @xmath157 taking into account the mentioned notices , this solution will not converge , but it is still useful because it allows us to construct linear a approximation which reproduces the behaviour of the solution . using the finite - difference scheme and the digit shifting procedure",
    "we obtain : @xmath158 here the shifted values are given by the following expressions : @xmath159 ,   \\quad \\omega_n = [ ( b_{1,n } + b_{0,n } - a_{0,n } - a_{0,n}^2b_{0,n})\\tau].\\ ] ]    let us see how a linear approximation can be constructed . from the initial condition we imply that @xmath160    _ layer 0 _    from the initial values we obtain @xmath161 and @xmath162 : @xmath163 now we calculate @xmath164 and @xmath165 : @xmath166 a value @xmath113 will be the minimum of values @xmath164 and @xmath165 , namely : @xmath167 a value @xmath113 defines @xmath168 : @xmath169 now we can write the linear approximation in a segment @xmath170 $ ] : @xmath171 to get a solution in the next layer we must compute the initial values for it .",
