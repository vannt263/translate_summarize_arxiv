    "pulling polymers out of potential wells by applying a force @xmath0 in the direction orthogonal to the pinning region has been considered at several instances ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the techniques employed essentially lead to exact ( and mathematically rigorous ) results for models with homogeneous interactions ( see in particular @xcite and @xcite ) , while in the inhomogeneous case , notably in the disordered case , the results are often based on arguments out of mathematical control ( _ e.g. _ , replica and renormalization group computations ) or on annealed approximations that , in general , are not close to the behavior of the quenched system .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena that has been pointed out , at least in some model systems , is the presence of a re - entrant transition ( see in particular @xcite , but this issue is taken up in most of the references we have given ) . by this we mean that , for a fixed force @xmath0 , the polymer is pulled out of the defect line at low temperature and at high temperature , but for intermediate temperatures it is localized at the defect line , very much like if the force was not present .",
    "references above are limited to theoretical work , but all of them are motivated by real experiments : the literature on real experiments is very rich and here we single out @xcite that deals with dna unzipping and contains further references .    our purpose is to point out that one can directly relate the free energy in presence of a force to the free energy of the polymer with free endpoint for a very large class of directed models and that the presence of a re - entrant transition is easily related to suitable asymptotic behavior of the expressions appearing in this formula . as a consequence , we will give a simple necessary ad sufficient condition for the re - entrance to take place for very general models ( including disordered models ) .",
    "in order to be concrete we choose to deal with a precise and rather limited class of models , but the reader will realize that the method we present is very general .",
    "extensions are considered explicitly in section [ sec : generalize ] .",
    "moreover , the phenomenology of the restricted class of models we consider is already very rich .",
    "we point out that we focus exclusively on cases in which the polymer interacts only at the defect line and other relevant cases , like the case in which bulk disorder is present ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , are not considered here . on the other hand , it is straightforward to generalize the content of this note to directed models of copolymers near a selective interface @xcite .",
    "let us consider a @xmath1-walk , that is a random walk @xmath2 with independent identically distributed ( iid ) increments @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 taking values in @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we assume @xmath9 and @xmath10 . particularly relevant for what follows",
    "is the distribution of @xmath11 : therefore we set @xmath12 , along with @xmath13 .",
    "we point out that the laplace transform of @xmath14 , that is @xmath15 , @xmath16 , can be written explicitly and @xmath17 itself can be expressed in terms of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , by using a standard renewal theory formula @xmath20 in particular one obtains that @xmath21 converges to @xmath22 ( * ? ? ?",

    "note also that @xmath25 , since @xmath26 is recurrent .    given a sequence @xmath27 of real numbers ( the _ charges _ )",
    "we define the new measure @xmath28 on the space of random walk paths by introducing a boltzmann weight ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) : @xmath31    we will consider two ( wide ) classes of charges :    1 .",
    "@xmath32 is a periodic ( deterministic ) sequence , _",
    "i.e. _ a sequence of numbers such that @xmath33 for some positive integer @xmath34 and every @xmath35 .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 the minimal @xmath34 with such a property , that is the _",
    "period_. if @xmath37 then @xmath32 is homogeneous",
    "@xmath32 is the realization of a sequence of random variables . for simplicity",
    "we consider only the case of iid variables , therefore the law of @xmath32 is determined by the law of @xmath38 , but our analysis would go through in the much wider domain of stationary sequences of variables . in the end , the properties of the system are determined by the law @xmath39 of @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to this case as _ disordered _ or _",
    "quenched_.    the existence of the limit @xmath40 is very well known .",
    "this follows from elementary super - additivity arguments in the periodic ( and , of course , in the homogeneous ) set - up ( see _ e.g. _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  1 ) ) : in general , the limit depends on @xmath32 . in the disordered case instead one has to be a bit more careful : a precise statement is for example that if @xmath41 then the limit in exists @xmath39-almost surely and also in the @xmath42 sense .",
    "moreover the right - hand side is in principle a random variable , but it turns out to be degenerate , that is almost surely independent of @xmath32 .",
    "this property , usually referred to as _ self - averaging _",

    "4 ) for proofs and overview of the literature ) .",

    "much literature has been spent on this model and about the fact that @xmath47 corresponds to localized regime , that is to the case in which the typical trajectories are tightly bound to the defect line ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) ) . on the other hand",
    "@xmath48 corresponds to a delocalized regime .",
    "one should however distinguish between the critical point @xmath49 and the truly delocalized region where @xmath50 .",
    "several results are available also on the delocalized regime ( see @xcite and references therein , in particular @xcite for the disordered case ) and they say , very roughly , that very few visits are paid by the polymer to the defect line .",
    "a relevant difference between the two classes of charges we consider is that in the first case @xmath51 is explicitly known . to be more precise in the periodic case @xmath51",
    "can be expressed in terms of the leading eigenvalue of a suitable @xmath52 perron  frobenius matrix @xcite ( see also appendix [ sec : appt ] ) : computing such an eigenvalue becomes harder and harder for larger periods , but the problem trivializes in the homogeneous case . in the disordered case instead only estimates on @xmath51 are known .",
    "we point out also that for every @xmath53 the limit @xmath54 \\ , : = \\ , { \\textsc{g}}(y),\\ ] ] exists . actually , the explicit value of @xmath55 is easily computed by applying the reflection principle (",
    "a ) and one obtains @xmath56 .    for the model with the force",
    "we have :    [ th : decomp ] for every @xmath46 and @xmath0 the limit , that we denote by @xmath57 , of the sequence @xmath58 exists ( @xmath59-almost surely ( a.s . ) , in the disordered case ) .",
    "moreover we have the formula @xmath60    a line of non - analytic points of @xmath61 is therefore evident : for every @xmath46 we set @xmath62 ( we are looking at @xmath55 as a function , and a bijection , from @xmath63 to @xmath63 ) .",
    "therefore for every @xmath46 @xmath64    it is quite easy to get convinced that this non - analyticity corresponds to a localization  delocalization transition : the most interesting case is when @xmath47 , otherwise the system is already delocalized at @xmath65 . by convexity , @xmath66 if @xmath67 ( and if @xmath68 exists ) .",
    "this directly implies that @xmath69 ( and the same statement holds even if @xmath68 does not exist , but one has to replace the @xmath70 with @xmath71 ) . for @xmath72 instead @xmath73",
    "these are distinctive marks respectively of localization and delocalization ( for sharper results we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worthwhile to observe that formula yields that @xmath74 is discontinuous at @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "so the transition is of first order ( as argued in much of the previous literature ) .",
    "the underlying mechanism has also been expoited in @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the issue of the existence of a re - entrant transition .",
    "as mentioned above , this refers to the fact that for some fixed @xmath0 the system undergoes ( at least ) two phase transitions as the temperature @xmath77 is increased from zero to infinity .",
    "more precisely , two cases are observed : one can either observe a pattern of the type localized - delocalized - localized by increasing @xmath78 , or the opposite one : delocalized - localized - delocalized .",
    "of course , re - entrance is equivalent to the non - monotonicity of @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 and a sufficient condition for it is that the difference @xmath81 has the opposite sign as @xmath82 . as we show in the following ,",
    "these quantities are related to the asymptotic behavior of @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which in many cases ( including quenched disordered situations ) can be easily computed without fully solving the model .",
    "we wish to emphasize that , while in principle the occurrence of @xmath86<0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is just a sufficient condition for re - entrance , it turns out numerically in the cases we have checked ( _ cf . _",
    "[ fig : homog ] and [ fig : t ] ) that when is not verified the critical force is monotone in @xmath80 and re - entrance is absent .",
    "this section has the two aims :    1 .   generalizing the results of the previous literature .",
    "for example in @xcite only the cases @xmath87 and @xmath88 are considered and no re - entrance is observed , while for different values of @xmath89 re - entrance does appear ; 2 .   providing the general scheme that we follow also in the next sections , even if the models of this section are exactly solvable ( but we will not solve them ) .",
    "first of all note that , if @xmath90 the polymer is delocalized already in absence of the force , and @xmath91 for every @xmath92 , an uninteresting situation .",
