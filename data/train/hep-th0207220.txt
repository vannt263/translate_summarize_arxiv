    "noncommutative quantum field theory has been intensively studied during the last years ( for a review see @xcite ) . at first , the idea of noncommutativity was motivated by the hope that its introduction ( and the ensuing nonlocality ) would allow for the construction of theories with improved ultraviolet behavior .",
    "this expectation was not fulfilled as noncommutative theories exhibit ultraviolet divergences of the same sort as the ones found in the commutative situation .",
    "however , nowadays there are other motivations , coming mainly from string theory and quantum gravity , which keep a very keen interest on the subject .",
    "being intrinsically nonlocal these models present many unusual aspects which deserve painstaking investigation .",
    "its main characteristic is the appearence of an infrared ( ir ) singularity ( also referred to as uv / ir mixing@xcite ) which may ruin some of the properties that a well defined quantum field theory is required to possess .",
    "for instance , perturbative renormalizability is usually lost in noncommutative theories although it is regained in the supersymmetric case ( see@xcite and @xcite for studies in non - gauge and gauge theories , respectively ) .",
    "another aspect which deserves a better understanding is the effect of these ir singularities on the mechanism of symmetry breakdown and the appearance of goldstone bosons in noncommutative field theory .",
    "previous studies unveiled some interesting features .",
    "for the four dimensional linear sigma model it has been shown that , at one loop , spontaneous breakdown may occur for the @xmath5 theory but not for @xmath0 if @xmath6 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the goldstone theorem holds only if the field ordering in the quartic moyal product is consistent with local symmetry @xcite .",
    "other properties of the @xmath7 case have also been studied in @xcite and the results for the @xmath5 case have been extended to two loops @xcite .",
    "attempts to go to higher loops requires an ir regulator which can not longer be removed@xcite .",
    "thus , only certain noncommutative extensions preserve the main features of their commutative counterpart .",
    "one may ask whether this depends upon the dimensionality of space - time or on the nature of the interaction or on both .",
    "this paper provides further understanding on this problem by means of some specific examples .",
    "we shall start by studying the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the continuous @xmath0 symmetry in a three dimensional theory and in a supersymmetric version of it , with the aim learning about the role played by supersymmetry .    in the nonsupersymmetric case we find that there is class of field orderings for which no uv / ir mixing occurs at one loop . unlike the four dimensional case it does not require gauge invariant couplings .",
    "interesting enough , the condition for the elimination of uv divergences , in the planar sector of the pion two point function , also secures the cancellation of the would be ir divergence , in the nonplanar sector , and , at the same time , enforces the appearance of massless excitations .",
    "this mechanism is absent in the four dimensional case .",
    "we remark that it is possible to extend the nonsupersymmetric model by adding a purely noncommutative interaction , i.e. , one with no commutative analog .",
    "it gives loop contributions starting at order @xmath4 so it is not relevant for our one loop results .",
    "it also exists in superspace but gives no contribution to the supersymmetric case .",
    "its role outside the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking deserves further investigation .    while in four dimensions supersymmetry removes a dangerous ir quadratic singularity , in our three dimensional case it just restricts further the class of allowed models .",
    "moreover , for a specific moyal ordering we find evidence of its renormalizability to any order in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "as far as noncommutative four dimensional theories are concerned , we shall be dealing with effective supersymmetric field models which arise as the low energy limit of compactified string or m theory .",
    "usually the tree level exchange of heavy fields leads to nonrenormalizable interactions in the effective potential of the light fields . in the supersymmetric case",
    ", the decoupling of the heavy fields leads to corrections to the effective superpotential @xcite and to the khler potential of the light fields @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamics of d3-branes may be described , for slowly varying fields , by a born - infeld type action in which the transversal radial excitations are a set of scalar fields @xcite . in the supersymmetric case one finds a chiral superfield in a specific superpotential @xcite . in view of this",
    "it is natural to analyze the noncommutative versions of such theories and to study the validity of the goldstone theorem for them , since they provide extensions of realistic string models .",
    "we assume that the interaction can be approximated by a general superpotential @xcite which allows for a local @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "it will be shown that , at one loop , there is no corrections to the pion mass so that goldstone theorem holds true .",
    "then , using supersymmetry alone , we go to two loops and show that for slowing varying superfields there are , again , no pion mass corrections .",
    "thus , supersymmetry enables us to transpose the @xmath9 barrier found for the purely bosonic quartic interaction@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the noncommutative version of the @xmath0 scalar model with quartic and sextuple interactions is presented and the spontaneous symmetry breaking is studied .",
    "section iii contains a discussion of its supersymmetric version in superspace . finally , in section iv we discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a chiral superfield in a generic superpotential in four dimensions .",
    "the conclusions are left to section v.",
    "we start our analysis by considering the possible spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath0 symmetry in a @xmath11 dimensional model described by the action ( subscripts from the beginning and the middle of the latin alphabet run from 1 to @xmath1 and from 1 to @xmath12 , respectively )    @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath14 indicates the moyal product which satisfies    @xmath15    here , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the antisymmetric constant matrix characterizing the underlying noncommutativity .",

    "the contribution of this supergraph turns out to be proportional to    @xmath165    which also vanishes due to the chirality of @xmath30 .",
    "had we used other orderings this expression would contain non trivial phase factors but , nevertheless , still would vanish by the same reason ( i.e. , the chirality of the pion field ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that at one - loop order there is no mass renormalization and this is entirely due to the chirality of the superfield @xmath30 .",
    "this is in contrast to the supersymmetric case in three dimensions where a nonvanishing contribution was found .",
    "there the superfields are real and no chirality argument is available .    just using supersymmetry and",
    "chirality arguments allow us to go beyond one loop straightfowardly . at two loops we have to consider supergraphs with two @xmath30 external lines which are drawn in fig .",
    "the supergraphs in figs .",
    "6@xmath94 , 6@xmath166 , 6@xmath167 and 6@xmath11 contain tadpole - like loop contributions consisting of one propagator @xmath168 or @xmath169 .",
    "since they are proportional to @xmath170 or @xmath171 , they both vanish .",
    "the supergraphs in figs .",
    "6@xmath172 , 6@xmath127 , 6@xmath47 , 6@xmath41 , 6@xmath173 , 6@xmath174 and 6@xmath175 have equal numbers of @xmath119 and @xmath148 factors , hence , after @xmath150-algebra transformations , their contributions are proportional to @xmath176 which is equal to zero due to chirality of @xmath30 .",
    "the supergraphs depicted in figs .",
    "6@xmath40 , 6@xmath177 and 6@xmath74 are proportional to @xmath178 and to @xmath179 .",
    "both structures give vanishing contributions after integration by parts .",
    "finally , the supergraph drawn in fig .",
    "6@xmath180 is proportional to @xmath181 and vanishes for slowly varying superfields .",
    "we then conclude that there is no loop corrections to the pion mass for slowing varying superfields .",
    "then the goldstone theorem is satisfied at one and two loops order for the @xmath0 supersymmetric chiral superfield whose interactions are compatible with gauge invariance . notice that the vanishing of these corrections is due to the supersymmetry and not to relations among the coupling constants .",
    "in fact , this is a generalization of the nonrenormalization theorems of supersymmetric theories @xcite to the noncommutative context .",
    "we can also consider the purely noncommutative interaction ( [ epsilon ] ) in superspace .",
    "its contribution to ( [ wcorrec ] ) is similar to ( [ eps ] ) but its loop constributions always vanish since @xmath182 .",
    "so it is also not relevant for the results just derived .",
    "in this work , the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the appearance of goldstone bosons were investigated in connection with several noncommutative field models .",
    "we first studied the spontaneous breakdown of the continuous @xmath0 symmetry in a noncommutative scalar model with quartic and sextuple interactions . for @xmath52-dimensions",
    ", there is a class of fields ordering for which the model turned out to be renormalizable , up to one loop .",
    "the linear combination of couterterms fixed by the gap equation equals the @xmath51-field mass counterterm .",
    "moreover , for the pion two point function , a single condition suffices to ensure : i ) cancellation of the uv divergences , ii ) cancellation of the ir divergences arising from the uv / ir mixing , iii ) appearance of massless excitations . as shown , this is a peculiarity of the @xmath52-dimensional world . in @xmath3-dimensions renormalizability",
    "called for the elimination of the sextuple interactions while the @xmath67 convergence of the planar part restricts the dynamics as already found in @xcite . in @xmath52-dimensions",
    "supersymmetry restrics even further the class of allowed models while , on the other hand , renders the theory renormalizable to all orders in the limit @xmath183 .",
    "secondly , we studied a generic chiral model in @xmath3-dimensions with a local @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "we argue that this model , although being not renormalizable by power counting , may provide a realistic description of the low energy limit of compactified string or m - theory .",
    "there are no one loop corrections to the pion mass while the same holds for two loops in the limit of slowly varying superfields .",
    "supersymmetry enabled us to go through the @xmath184 barrier existing for purely bosonic interactions@xcite .",
    "we also found a purely noncommutative interaction which preserves the @xmath0 symmetry and is present in any dimension .",
    "it starts contributing at @xmath4 loops so that it is not relevant for our one loop analysis .",
    "it clearly deserves further study for the understanding of its properties .    also relevant",
    "is the phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry in noncommutative supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "its study is in progress .",
