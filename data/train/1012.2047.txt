    "terzan  5 is commonly catalogued as a globular cluster ( gc ) located in the inner bulge of our galaxy .",
    "it is heavily reddened , with an average color excess @xmath5 @xcite and such a reddening strongly depends on the line of sight @xcite .",
    "this stellar system also harbors an exceptionally large population of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) : indeed , the 34 msps detected so - far in terzan  5 amount to @xmath6 of the entire sample of known msps in galactic gcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the updated list at http://www.naic.edu/@xmath7pfreire/gcpsr.html ) .",
    "recently , a combined photometric and spectroscopic study of terzan  5 has led to the discovery of two distinct populations , as traced by two well separated ( @xmath8 ) red clumps in the @xmath9 color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , with a @xmath100.5 dex difference in their iron content ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f09 ) .",
    "a conventional isochrone fit is consistent with the two populations of terzan 5 being separated by a few gyr ( f09 ) , although only a small age gap is needed if the younger population is enhanced in helium @xcite .",
    "the findings in f09 appear to be best understood if terzan  5 was much more massive in the past than today , in order to retain the sn ejecta and igniting other star formation episodes .",
    "a more massive proto - terzan  5 would also naturally explain its large population of msps and the fact that the metal - rich component is more centrally concentrated than the metal - poor one ( f09 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a typical feature of stellar systems which are self - enriched in iron , as , e.g. , the dwarf galaxies .    with the aim of accurately reconstructing the puzzle of the formation and evolutionary history of terzan  5 , we are currently undertaking a global study of the photometric , chemical and kinematic properties of its stellar populations .",
    "this letter presents the results of the spectroscopic screening of a suitable sample of giant stars , in order to obtain chemical abundances and abundance patterns of key metals , like iron , carbon , aluminum , oxygen and other @xmath2-elements , and constrain the complex chemical enrichment history of terzan  5 .",
    "in order to select suitable targets , we used the differential - reddening corrected optical - ir cmd of terzan  5 shown in figure 4 of f09 . in this diagram",
    "it is possible to recognize not only two red clumps , but also two main red giant branches ( rgbs ) .",
    "we therefore selected a sample of red giants mostly located along the two rgbs and spanning the entire luminosity range above the horizontal branch ( hb ) level , with the purpose of fully characterizing their chemical content .",
    "high resolution spectra have been acquired on july 1 - 2 , 2010 by using nirspec @xcite at keck ii",
    ". a slit width of @xmath11 , giving an overall spectral resolution r=25,000 , and the standard nirspec-5 setting , which covers a large fraction of the 1.5 - 1.8 @xmath12 m @xmath13-band , have been used .",
    "about 40 stars have been observed during the run .",
    "here we report and discuss the results for 33 giants having radial velocities consistent with the systemic velocity of terzan  5 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. likely members of the system .    the raw spectra have been reduced using the redspec idl - based package written at the ucla ir laboratory .",
    "each order has been sky subtracted by using nodding pairs , and flat - field corrected .",
    "wavelength calibration has been performed using arc lamps and a 2-nd order polynomial solution , while telluric features have been removed by using a o - star featureless spectrum observed during the same nights .",
    "the signal to noise ratio of the final spectra is always larger than 30 .",
    "figure  [ spec ] shows an example of the observed spectra .",
    "a grid of suitable synthetic spectra of giant stars has been computed by varying the photospheric parameters and the element abundances , by using an updated version of the code described in @xcite . by combining full spectral synthesis analysis and equivalent width measurements of selected lines ,",
    "we have derived abundances for fe , c , o , ca , si , mg , ti and al . our line list and details of the analysis",
    "are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "reference solar abundances are from @xcite .",
    "stellar temperatures have been first estimated from the ( @xmath14)@xmath15 colors , by using the e(@xmath16)=2.38 average reddening and the color - temperature transformation by @xcite , specifically calibrated on gc giants .",
    "gravity has been estimated from theoretical evolutionary tracks , according to the location of the stars on the rgb , while for the microturbulence velocity an average value of 2 km / s has been adopted ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "more stringent constraints on the stellar parameters have been obtained by the simultaneous spectral fitting of several co and oh molecular bands , which are very sensitive to temperature , gravity and microturbulence variations ( see figs . 6 and 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "the final values of the adopted stellar parameters , radial velocity and our best - fit chemical abundances with @xmath17 random errors are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we conservatively estimate that the systematic errors in the derived best - fit abundances , due to the residual uncertainty in the adopted stellar parameters , are @xmath18 dex .",
    "however , it must be noted that any variation in the stellar parameters makes all the spectral features under consideration vary in a similar way ( although with different sensitivities ) .",
    "hence , the derived _ relative _ abundances are less dependent on the adopted stellar parameters , i.e. they are affected by smaller systematic errors .",
    "by the inspection of the iron abundance distribution ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , the existence of two populations is clearly evident : a relatively metal - poor component ( as traced by 20 giants in our sample ) with average [ fe / h]@xmath19 r.m.s . , and a metal - rich component ( as traced by 13 giants in our sample ) with average [ fe / h]@xmath20 r.m.s .. the two populations therefore show a @xmath21[fe / h]@xmath22 dex iron abundance difference , fully confirming first results by f09 based on the observations of a small sample of red clump stars .",
    "figure  [ alpha ] shows the various [ @xmath2/fe ] abundance ratios for the giants observed in terzan  5 and in other galactic stellar populations , for comparison .",
    "the computed average abundance ratios for the two terzan  5 components are listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we find an overall average [ @xmath2/h]@xmath23 and [ @xmath2/fe]@xmath24 for the metal - poor , and [ @xmath2/h]@xmath25 and [ @xmath2/fe]@xmath26 for the metal - rich stars .",
    "hence the two populations show @xmath27\\approx + 0.2 $ ] dex and a @xmath28\\approx -0.31 $ ] differences .",
    "the first important result of this study is that the two populations in terzan  5 have clearly distinct abundance patterns , the most metal - rich being significantly enriched in iron and moderately enriched in [ @xmath2/h ] , with respect to the metal - poor one .",
    "these properties have never been observed before in any galactic gc .",
    "in fact , all gcs are characterized by an extremely high homogeneity in the iron abundance0.1 dex ) iron dispersion have been reported in the literature for m22 @xcite , ngc 1851 @xcite , and m54 @xcite . ] . the only notable exception ( but in a significantly lower metallicity regime ) is the halo globular - like system @xmath29 centauri @xcite , which is , for this reason , currently believed to be the remnant of an accreted and partially disrupted dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "indeed , observational evidence of tidal debris from @xmath29 centauri already exist ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the overall iron abundance and the [ @xmath2/fe ] enhancement of the terzan  5 metal - poor component is consistent with what is measured in bulge stars ( see fig .",
    "[ alpha ] ) .",
    "this suggests that , as the bulk of the bulge population , this component in terzan  5 likely formed from a gas mainly enriched by type ii sne on a short timescale . when compared to the metal - poor component , the larger [ @xmath2/h ] overall abundance of the metal - rich one can be explained with an additional enrichment by type ii sne , whose ejecta must have been retained within the potential well in spite of the violent explosions .",
    "moreover , the solar [ @xmath2/fe ] abundance ratio indicates that its progenitor gas was also polluted by type ia sne explosions on longer timescales . among globular cluster - like stellar systems ,",
    "such a signature of type ia sne enrichment has been observed only in the most metal rich population of @xmath29 centauri ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ alpha ] also shows the [ al / fe ] _ vs _ [ fe / h ] abundance distribution , indicating that aluminum behaves like @xmath2-elements .",
    "figure  [ al ] shows the [ al / fe ] _ vs _ [ o / fe ] abundance ratios . as a whole ,",
    "the stars of terzan  5 display a clear positive correlation between [ al / fe ] and [ o / fe ] , at variance with the anti - correlation shown by ordinary gcs .",
    "in fact , it is well known that even genuine , single - metallicity gcs show large ( up to @xmath30 dex ) star - to - star variations in the abundance of light elements ( like na , o , mg , and al ) that are not observed in the galactic field stars , nor in the field of nearby dwarf galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] abundances are seen to anti - correlate with [ o / fe ] in all gcs that have been surveyed till the present day , both in the galaxy and beyond ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this chemical fingerprint is so specific to gcs that it has been proposed as the benchmark to classify a stellar system as a globular cluster @xcite . yet , neither the population as a whole , nor the two sub - components of terzan 5 show the al - o anticorrelation",
    ". moreover , each of the two populations shows spreads ( @xmath31 dex ) in both [ o / fe ] and [ al / fe ] not exceeding the 1@xmath32 measurement errors ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) , again at odds with the relatively large ( several tenths of dex ) cosmic spreads measured in gcs of any metallicity @xcite .",
    "hence , a second important result from our study is that terzan  5 experienced a chemical enrichment history which is different from the path typically leading to the development of the al  o anti - correlation and the presence of multiple stellar populations in gcs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .@xmath33 @xcite , both the populations of terzan  5 lie in a metallicity range which has no direct counterpart among galactic gcs . ] in this respect , it is also interesting to note that the stars in @xmath29 centauri , while sharing with terzan  5 a significant spread in iron , clearly exhibit anti - correlation signatures , both as a whole , and within each metallicity sub - group , the only possible exception being the most metal - rich stars @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that the chemical enrichment history of terzan  5 differs also from the one of @xmath29 centauri .",
    "finally , tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] show that [ c / fe ] is depleted with respect to the solar value in both populations .",
    "such a carbon depletion is commonly measured in the bulge giants ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it indicates that some extra - mixing processes are at work during the evolution along the rgb even at metallicities close to solar .",
    "the main observational evidences from the photometric and spectroscopic studies performed so far on terzan 5 can be summarized as follows .",
    "* terzan  5 shows at least two stellar populations ( as traced by both red clump and rgb stars ) with distinct iron content and @xmath34/fe ] abundance patterns .",
    "the metal - poor population ( [ fe / h]@xmath35 - 0.2 ) is @xmath2-enhanced and closely resembles the bulk of the old bulge population ( except for the extremely small spread in iron ) , which formed early and quickly from a gas mainly polluted by type ii sne .",
    "the metal - rich population has a metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath35 + 0.3 ) , and an approximately scaled solar [ @xmath2/fe ] ratio , requiring a progenitor gas further polluted by both type ii and type ia sne on a longer timescale .",
    "it is difficult to place the chemistry of terzan 5 within the framework of known gcs . indeed , while no genuine galactic gc displays such a large difference in the iron content , and even remotely resembles the metallicity regime of the two stellar populations of terzan  5 , stars with similar iron content have been observed in the bulge field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* neither terzan  5 as a whole , nor the two populations separately show evidence of the al - o anti - correlation .",
    "as soon as the anti - correlation is also effective at solar metallicity and above , this further suggests that terzan  5 as a whole is not a genuine gc , and also that it can not be the merging of two globulars .",
    "* its current mass of a few @xmath36 @xcite is not sufficient to retain the sn ejecta and the large population of neutron stars which , thanks to an exceptionally high stellar collision rate @xcite , could have been recycled into the multitude of msps that we observe today .    in order to draw more firm conclusions about the origin of terzan  5 and its possible bimodal nature",
    "it is necessary to _ ( i ) _ complete the chemical screening of its populations , by also sampling stars that , in the cmd , are located between the two main rgbs , _",
    "( ii ) _ perform and analyze ultra - deep ir imaging to accurately measure the luminosity of the main sequence turn - off point(s ) and derive the ages of each component , and _ ( iii ) _ combine radial velocity and proper motion measurements to properly determine the kinematics of the system .",
    "however , considering the information available so far , we venture the following speculations .",
    "the complex stellar population of terzan  5 and the higher central concentration of the most metal - rich component ( see f09 and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be naturally explained within a self - enrichment scenario .",
    "an originally more massive proto - terzan experienced the explosions of a large number of type ii and type ia sne , whose ejecta have been retained within the potential well and which could also have wiped out the anti - correlation signatures typical of gcs . in such a scenario ,",
    "the terzan  5 evolution should have been characterized by two main and relatively short episodes of star formation , thus accounting for the small metallicity spread of both populations .",
    "in addition , the striking chemical similarity between terzan  5 and the bulge population can also suggest a strong evolutionary link between these two stellar systems and possibly a common origin and evolution .",
    "the current view @xcite for the formation of a bulge structure suggests a range of physical processes that can be grouped in two main scenarios : ( 1 ) rapid formation occurring at early epochs ( as a fast dissipative collapse , mergers of proto - clouds / sub - structures , evaporation of a proto - disk , etc . ) , generating a spheroidal bulge populated by old stars , and ( 2 ) evolution of a central disk / bar and its possible interaction with other sub - structures on a longer timescale . within this framework",
    ", terzan 5 might well be the relic of a larger sub - structure that lost most of its stars , probably because of strong dynamical interactions with other similar systems at the early epoch of the galaxy formation , and/or later on with the central disk / bar .",
    "while most of the early fragments dissolved / merged together to form the bulge , for some ( still unclear ) reasons terzan 5 survived the total disruption .",
    "note that within this scenario , while the oldest population of terzan 5 would trace the early stages of the bulge formation , the younger one could contain crucial information on its more recent chemical and dynamical evolution .",
    "the metal rich sub - component of terzan 5 stands as a remarkable stellar population , worthy of more study .",
