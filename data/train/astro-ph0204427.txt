    "there are two types of supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the x - ray region from a morphological point of view : a shell structure and a filled - center structure .",
    "some snrs in each type contain a point source at its center .",
    "therefore , the point source at its center does not always affect the morphology of the snr .",
    "the shell structure is generated as the result of a blast wave propagating inside the interstellar matter ( ism ) , while the origin of the filled - center structure has not yet been established .",
    "a cloud evaporation model can explain the filled - center structure ( white , long  1991 ) . the clouds in the interstellar space will gradually evaporate after passage of the blast wave , which enhances the brightness of the central part of the snr , resulting in the filled - center structure .",
    "many of them show evidence of the interactions with molecular clouds , and have been studied from a theoretical point of view ( chevalier  1999 ) .",
    "another explanation is a radiative phase model ( cox  1972 ) .",
    "when the density at the shell region increases , the radiative instability proceeds and reduces the temperature of the shell region so that it becomes x - ray dim in the shell region .",
    "rho and petre ( 1998 ) proposed a new group of snr , `` mixed - morphology ( mm ) snr '' , among the filled - center snrs based on a rosat observation .",
    "they are characterized as having 1 ) a shell structure in the radio region , 2 ) a filled - center structure in the x - ray region , 3)an absence of a compact source in its center , and 4 ) thin thermal emission in the x - ray region showing a solar or sub - solar abundance .",
    "the forth criterion is considered to mean that the x - ray emitting plasma is not contaminated by the ejecta .",
    "they selected 7snrs belonging to this group as proto - typical mm snrs : w28 , w44 , 3c400.2 , kes27 , msh11 - 61a , 3c391 and ctb1 .",
    "they also claimed 7 other snrs as probably belonging to this group .    in young snrs , like cassiopeia -",
    "a , there is a large inhomogeneity in metal abundance ( hwang et al .",
    "2000 ) . even in a middle - aged snr , like the cygnus loop , the abundance in the shell region is quite different from that in its center ( miyata et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) , whereas the absolute intensity in the center is quite weak .",
    "although these two snrs belong to the shell structure , it will take long time before the convection of the ejecta with the ism is completed .",
    "therefore , the uniform abundance in the snr may become an important clue to form a new class of snrs .    among the mm snrs ,",
    "yoshita et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported on the x - ray structure of 3c400.2 using the asca satellite , which has better energy resolution than that of rosat .",
    "they found no spectral variation across the snr , with a possible exception of the abundance of fe . due to an elongation in the radio image",
    ", they studied a possible interaction of two snrs .",
    "they concluded that it was generated from a single snr , rather than two .",
    "the snr , kes27 ( g327.4 + 0.4 ) , is classified as a proto - typical mm type snr . in the radio wavelength , it shows a shell structure with a diameter of @xmath7 with a slight complexity , a typical shell with an arm in the northwest .",
    "it has a spectral index of @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( milne et al.1989 ) , which is a typical value of shell - type snrs in the radio region .",
    "no optical emission has been detected from kes  27 ( van den bergh  1978 ; kirshner , winkler  1979 ) .",
    "the x - ray observation of kes27 was initially motivated by the fact that the remnant was located within the error circle of the cosb unidentified @xmath10-ray source , cg3270 ( hermsen et al .",
    "lamb and markert ( 1981 ) observed kes27 with the einstein ipc , and found that the x - ray emission was centrally peaked .",
    "an ipc image was also given by seward ( 1990 ) , which clearly showed clumpy x - ray emission .",
    "seward et al .  ( 1996 ) reported using rosat data that there were several unresolved point - like sources as well as diffuse emission .",
    "it showed not only emission from inside , but also that from the bright eastern shell , which coincides with the bright radio emission .",
    "spectral studies of the diffuse emission showed little difference between the central region and the eastern rim .",
    "we report here on an observation of kes27 using the asca satellite to study its x - ray structure , particularly its spectral variation .",
    "the asca observation of kes27 was performed on 1994 august 21@xmath1122 .",
    "we retrieved these data from darts astrophysical database at the isas plain center .",
    "the siss ( yamashita et al .  1997 ) were operated in a combination of the 2-ccd bright mode and of the 4-ccd faint mode .",
    "some data were obtained in the 2-ccd mode , while others were obtained in the 4-ccd mode .",
    "since the radio shell of kes27 has the diameter of @xmath12 , most of the remnant can be covered by the field of view ( fov ) of the sis in the 4-ccd mode , which is a square of @xmath13 . since the major part of the observation was done in the 4-ccd mode , we only selected the 4-ccd faint mode data .",
    "we excluded all of the data taken at an elevation angle from the earth rim below @xmath14 from the night earth rim and @xmath15 ( sis  0 ) or @xmath16 ( sis  1 ) from the day earth rim , a geomagnetic cutoff rigidity lower than 6gv , and the region of the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "after screening the above criteria , we further removed the time region of a sudden change of the corner pixels of x - ray events .",
    "we then removed the hot and flickering pixels and corrected cti , dfe and echo effects ( dotani et al .",
    "1995 ) from our data set .",
    "the exposure times after the screening were 9ks for sis  0 , and 11ks for sis  1 .",
    "the giss were operated in the ph mode with the standard bit assignments ( makishima et al .",
    "the gis data were also screened in a different way .",
    "we excluded all of the data taken at an elevation angle from the earth rim below @xmath14 , a geomagnetic cutoff rigidity lower than 6gv , and the region of the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "the exposure times after the screening were 13ks for gis  2 and gis  3 , respectively .",
    "we subtracted the non - x - ray background and the cosmic x - ray background from the data .",
    "we then made a correction for vignetting .",
    "figure  [ fig : kes27_gismost ] shows the gis image of kes27 in the 0.710kev energy band .",
    "the overlaid contours are the radio map reproduced from the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) observation ( milne et al .",
    "1985 , 1989 ) .",
    "it clearly shows the centrally peaked x - ray emission confined by the radio shell . in the radio map , there are two bright regions drawn in red contour : one is the east rim and the other is the center .",
    "therefore , the radio - bright rim in the east is relatively dim in x - rays , while the radio - bright center is bright in x - rays .",
    "figure  [ fig : kes27_gisimage ] shows gis images for two energy bands : the low - energy ( 0.72kev ) band and the high - energy ( 210kev ) band . comparing the low - energy band image with that obtained by the pspc ( seward et al .",
    "1996 ) , we noticed that the asca image shows no rim brightening in the eastern rim .",
    "the eastern rim was detected with the einstein ipc with relatively weak intensity ( seward 1990 ) .",
    "considering the difference in the energy bands of these detectors , the emission from the eastern rim must be soft in the spectrum .",
    "seward et al .  ( 1996 ) reported several point - like x - ray sources detected by the pspc inside the remnant . comparing the image obtained by the hri",
    ", they found that these sources show soft emission . due to the spatial resolution of asca",
    ", we found no point - like feature corresponding to them .",
    "the asca image shows a centrally peaked structure that does not coincide with the point source reported .",
    "we generated the gis band ratio map by dividing the 210kev image by the 0.72kev image , as shown in figure  [ fig : kes27_gishard ] .",
    "it shows that the central part shows a harder spectrum than that of the outer region .",
    "the hardest region statistically coincides with the x - ray brightest region , which might suggest the existence of a point source in the center .",
    "we extracted the gis and sis spectra from the circular region with a diameter of 18@xmath17 , which is shown by the outermost circle in the thick solid line in figure  [ fig : kes27_gis0710 ] , which surely covers the entire x - ray emission observed .",
    "since kes27 is located near the galactic plane , ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) = ( , ) , the galactic ridge emission should be taken into account .",
    "therefore , we extracted the annular region around the source as the background spectra .",
    "we selected the annular region of inner and outer diameters of 24@xmath17 and 30@xmath17 as the background for the gis data .",
    "similarly , we selected the region of the sis fov outside a circle of 22@xmath17 diameter as background for the sis data . in the subtraction process",
    ", we took into account the vignetting effect of the x - ray optics .",
    "after background subtraction , we found that there is no emission above 4kev .",
    "we , therefore , employed the spectra up to 4kev for a spectral analysis .",
    "we performed a simultaneous fit of the model using the gis and sis data . from the spectra in figure  [ fig : kes27_spec_entire ] ,",
    "the emission lines of si and s are clearly seen , which indicates that the x - ray emission comes from a thin thermal plasma in origin .",
    "we employed the vmekal model in ftool  5.1 where the free parameters were the interstellar absorption feature , @xmath20 , electron temperature , @xmath21 , abundances of mg , si , s , ar , and fe .",
    "the other metal abundances were fixed to the solar values .",
    "we obtained a statistically good fit , the results of which are listed in table  [ tbl : kes27_fitpar ] , of the entire region .",
    "the best - fit curves are also shown in figure  [ fig : kes27_spec_entire ] .",
    "we should note that the obtained abundances are statistically consistent with those of the solar values . in the spectral fitting , we need not require to employ a model with the non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) condition .",
    "the ionization parameter , @xmath22 , the product of the electron density and the elapsed time after the shock heating , is longer than 10@xmath23@xmath2s , which indicates that the plasma almost reaches the collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) condition . using the plasma density",
    ", the value of @xmath22 gives us an age estimate of longer than @xmath4 yr , suggesting that the snr is in the radiative stage .",
    "we then tried to search for a spectral variation across the remnant .",
    "since the x - ray band ratio map shows a point symmetric structure , we divided the image into two regions : an inner region and an outer region .",
    "the inner region has a diameter of 6@xmath17 centered on the intensity peak in figure  [ fig : kes27_gis0710 ] .",
    "the outer region has an 18@xmath17 diameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : kes27_speceach ] shows the spectra obtained from the two regions .",
    "we also performed a model fitting by employing the same model to that employed for the entire region .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table  [ tbl : kes27_fitpar ] as well as the best - fit curves in figure  [ fig : kes27_speceach ] .",
    "we can notice that most of them show statistically the same value , with the exception of @xmath21 .",
    "we can say that there is a temperature decrease from the inner region towards the outer region that causes the harder spectra in the center .    as we mentioned before ,",
    "the x - ray brightest region does not coincide with the point source detected by rosat .",
    "if there is a point source inside the snr , it usually shows a hard spectrum and a possible pulsation .",
    "seward et al .  ( 1996 ) noticed the possibility that enhanced central emission could be due to a synchrotron nebula .",
    "our results do not require a power - law type component , like that expected for a possible point source inside the snr .",
    "we picked up photons in the 210kev range of the gis from the inner region .",
    "the total number of photons was 381 with a time resolution of 62.5ms .",
    "a fourier analysis showed no prominent pulsation component between 0.1252000s . due to the poor statistics ,",
    "we could not obtain a meaningful upper limit for the pulsation .",
    "the origin of the central emission is still unknown .",
    "so far , there is no reliable distance estimate to kes27 .",
    "seward et al .  ( 1996 ) assigned a distance of 6.5kpc by comparing the column density with that of the neighboring snr , rcw103 ( 5@xmath24 away from kes27 ) , whose distance was determined by a h measurement .",
    "case and bhattacharya ( 1998 ) used a refined @xmath25_d _ relation to derive a distance of 4.0kpc . here",
    ", we adopt a distance of 5kpc , an intermediate value of two estimates .    in order to determine the extent of the x - ray emitting plasma",
    ", we measured the solid angle subtended by a half - maximum intensity contour . in figure",
    "[ fig : kes27_gis0710 ] , the half - maximum intensity contour is drawn by the curved red line . the solid angle subtended by",
    "this contour corresponds to a circle with a diameter of . since kes27 shows a filled - center structure with a point - symmetric shape , we assume that the x - ray emitting plasma occupies a sphere with diameter @xmath26 and a uniform density .",
    "if this is the case , the half - maximum intensity contour becomes a circle with a diameter of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , we calculated various parameters while assuming the diameter of the plasma to be 13@xmath17 with a uniform density .",
    "we also assumed the electron density , @xmath28 , to be equal to the proton density , @xmath29 , for simplicity .",
    "these are summarized in table  [ tbl : kes27_prop ] .",
    "vwe performed a similar image analysis using the rosat pspc .",
    "we found that the solid angle subtended by the half - maximum intensity contour is equal to a circle with a diameter of 12@xmath17 , which is almost equal to that by using the asca gis .",
    "this can be understood because kes27 has such a high @xmath20 that the emission is confined to only the asca energy range .",
    "the apparent size in the radio region is @xmath30 ( whiteoak , green 1996 ) , which is bigger by 50% in size than that we measured in the x - ray region .",
    "the density given in table  [ tbl : kes27_prop ] is that of the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the total mass in the x - ray emitting region is a part of the mass affected by the sn explosion .",
    "the radio - bright region outside the x - ray emitting region must have a higher density than that inside , since it cools down and becomes x - ray dim .",
    "judging from the apparent sizes in the radio and x - ray regions , the total mass occupied outside the x - ray bright region must be by at least one order magnitude bigger than that in the x - ray bright region .",
    "therefore , if the ejecta contain plenty of metal , it must be dissolved into the ism , resulting in the solar abundance .",
    "this shows that kes27 is a typical mm snr .      in the radio band",
    ", kes27 shows a bright structure along the eastern rim .",
    "the bright radio feature on one side of the remnant resembles the radio morphology of snrs that are known to show an interaction with the molecular cloud , such as 3c391 and w44 . in general , a detection of shock - excited oh maser emission is a strong evidence for an interaction with the molecular cloud .",
    "the detection of oh maser emission was reported for 3c391 ( frail et al .",
    "1996 ) and w44 ( claussen et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) , while no oh emission has been detected toward kes27 ( frail et al .",
    "therefore , rho and petre ( 1998 ) noted that there is no evidence of an actual interaction with the molecular cloud in kes27 .",
    "the asca observation verified the centrally peaked and thin thermal x - ray nature for kes27 .",
    "in addition , we first found a spectral variation from the inner region towards the outer region .",
    "it should be noted that the harder spectrum in the inner region comes not from the heavier interstellar absorption but from the higher temperature .",
    "the value of @xmath21 in the inner region is higher by 40% than that in the outer region , while there is no variation of the abundances of heavy elements from a statistical point of view .",
    "the temperature gradient suggests that thermal conduction does not play an important role .",
    "however , our analysis may be an oversimplification due to showing an one - temperature model .",
    "other snrs having both a radio shell and centrally peaked x - ray emission with a thermal nature , like kes27 , have a uniform temperature distribution .",
    "for example , no significant @xmath21 variation has been found in 3c400.2 ( yoshita et al .",
    "2001 ) , g69.4 + 1.2 ( yoshita et al .",
    "2000 ) .    as mentioned in subsection  3.1 , there are two radio - bright regions in kes27 : one is in the east rim and the other is in the center .",
    "the bright - radio features are generally seen in the rim of the snr where the matter is compressed by a blast wave .",
    "when the matter is compressed , the polarization becomes prominent . the polarization map given by milne et al .",
    "( 1989 ) shows strong polarization in the east rim as well as in the center where both regions are radio - bright .",
    "however , the east rim is x - ray dim and the center is x - ray bright .",
    "therefore , it must be a projection effect that the bright radio feature in the center coincides with the x - ray bright region .",
    "future x - ray observations with a higher spatial resolution , such as by using chandra or xmm - newton , will reveal the relation between the x - ray intensity peak and the radio emission .",
    "we observed kes27 , a proto - typical mm snr , using asca gis and sis data .",
    "we confirmed a filled - center structure in the x - ray region with an angular diameter of 13@xmath17 , which is about 50% smaller than that of the radio bright region .",
    "the x - ray spectrum can be well fitted by a cie ( vmekal ) model with solar abundances . comparing the spectrum from the inner region with that from the outer region ,",
    "all of the spectral parameters are consistent with each other , with an exception of @xmath21 .",
    "the inner region clearly shows a higher value of @xmath21 by 40% than that in the outer region .",
    "this suggests that the thermal conduction does not play an important role .",
    "our analysis using asca supports that kes27 is a proto - typical mm snr .",
    "there are two radio - bright regions in kes27 : one is in the east rim and the other is in the center . the east rim is x - ray dim while the center is x - ray bright . by taking into account the radio polarization ,",
    "the coincidence between the x - ray and the radio in the center is found to be a projection effect .",
    "a finer observation in the future will reveal the detailed structure in the x - ray region as well as any coincidence between the x - ray and radio regions .",
    "the authors would like to express their special thanks to the asca team .",
    "this research was partially supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research by the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology of japan ( 13440062 , 13874032 ) .",
