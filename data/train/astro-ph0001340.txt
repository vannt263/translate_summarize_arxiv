    "the term _ duty cycle _ in astrophysics is defined as `` the fraction of time a pulsed beam is on '' @xcite .",
    "this term is more appropriate in describing periodic emitters such as pulsars than it is for non - periodic , one - time emitters such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "grb emission consists of pulses varying in intensity over a burst s duration , and is thus more conducive to a definition recognizing the continuous nature of grb emission than to one limited as either `` on '' or `` off . ''",
    "a more appropriate definition of grb duty cycle should describe the effectiveness of a grb as an emitter during the time that it emits .",
    "we therefore define the _ grb duty cycle _ as the average flux relative to its peak flux .",
    "this duty cycle definition can be described in terms of measured batse parameters ; it is essentially fluence divided by the quantity peak flux times duration .",
    "fluence and duration are two of the three defining characteristics of the three grb classes identified by statistical clustering techniques @xcite .",
    "spectral hardness is the third .",
    "fluence ( time - integrated flux ) incorporates information about duration in its definition .",
    "overlapping information appears to be contained in fluence and duration @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "duty cycle ( as defined here ) is a potentially valuable probe for studying properties of the three grb classes .",
    "properties of the three grb classes as determined from statistical clustering techniques @xcite are demonstrated in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".statistical clustering classes , from 3b grbs . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we define the duty cycle ( dc ) in terms of batse parameters as :    @xmath0    here , s@xmath1 is the channel 2 + 3 fluence ( time - integrated flux between 50 and 300 kev ) , t@xmath2 is the duration spanning 90% of the grb emission , and p@xmath3 is the 64 ms peak flux .",
    "@xmath4 is a constant for converting photon counts to energy ( assuming a diagonal detector response matrix as a first - order approximation ) .",
    "the peak flux used in this calculation must be measured on the shortest available timescale ( 64 ms ) in order to avoid arbitrarily smoothing out the maximum value of the peak flux .",
    "a peak flux underestimate produces a corresponding duty cycle overestimate .",
    "grbs with t@xmath2 durations less than 64 ms have had their t@xmath2 values set to 64 ms , so that their durations are not given a different temporal resolution than that of their peak flux measure .",
    "our database consists of non - overwriting grbs in the batse 4br catalog @xcite triggering on 1024 ms peak flux in the 50 to 300 kev range with the trigger threshold set @xmath5 above background .",
    "these criteria prevent trigger biases @xcite from influencing our conclusions .",
    "we have also removed grbs with large relative measurement errors in each of the four - channel fluences , t@xmath2 , and p@xmath3 so that measurement error does not bias our conclusions .",
    "the grbs have been assigned to a class using the supervised decision tree classifier c4.5 @xcite .",
    "the technique is described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we obtain an average value of @xmath6 ergs photon@xmath7 by integrating typical bright grb spectrum ( soft power law index @xmath8 ) over the 50 to 300 kev trigger energy range .",
    "many class 2 ( short ) grbs have duty cycles @xmath9 , as their harder spectra lead to an underestimate of a and to a corresponding overestimate of dc .",
    "we obtain a separate value of @xmath10 ergs photon@xmath7 for these grbs ( using @xmath11 ) , and recalculate their duty cycles .",
    "no attempt is made to account for class 3 ( intermediate ) spectra , which have similar spectral components to those of faint class 1 ( long ) bursts @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] is a plot of @xmath12 vs. hardness ratio @xmath13 ( 100 to 300 kev fluence divided by 25 to 100 kev fluence ) .",
    "this hardness ratio represents the third delineating attribute of the three grb classes .",
    "we note the following characteristics of grbs , and of the three grb classes ( based upon figure [ fig1 ] ) , as they pertain to the duty cycle :    * there are no efficient , soft grbs .",
    "* there are no inefficient , hard grbs . * class 2 ( short ) grbs are generally efficient , with duty cycles of @xmath14 .",
    "* class 1 ( long ) grbs are rarely efficient , with duty cycles of @xmath15 . *",
    "class 3 ( intermediate ) grbs blend into the class 1 ( long ) grbs in this plot .",
    "the duty cycle measure as defined here is fairly effective and easy to calculate .",
    "the simplifying assumption of a diagonalized detector response matrix is not completely valid .",
    "a small correction factor is needed to account for excess high - energy photons from hard grbs ( primarily those belonging to class 2 ) .",
    "nonetheless , this approach allows preprocessed batse attributes to be incorporated directly into the duty cycle calculation , without requiring the use of data in a less processed form .",
    "class 3 ( intermediate ) does not appear to be distinct from class 1 ( long ) on the basis of the duty cycle attribute .",
    "this result is in agreement with the findings of our artificial intelligence study @xcite .",
