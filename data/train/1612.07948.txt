    "the response of a molecule to an applied electromagnetic field is strongly modified by the nearby presence of metal nanoparticles ( nps ) or nanostructures .",
    "the resulting effects define the field of _ molecular plasmonics_@xcite and include many striking phenomena such as surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) , surface enhanced infrared absorption ( seira ) and metal enhanced fluorescence .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed through the years to understand such phenomena , some of which exploit a quantum - chemical description of the molecule.@xcite for these models , the nearby nanostructure is typically too large to be routinely treated by quantum chemistry ( qm ) methods as well . presently , metal nps of up to around 1000 atoms , i.e. , a few nm in diameter , can be described by qm methods,@xcite but they are much smaller than many nps of practical interest . to tackle this limitation , and taking into account the good quality that a classical electromagnetic ( em ) description gives of the optical properties of the np , in the past different groups devised multiscale methods that keep the quantum mechanical description of the molecule but include the np as a classical object , either as a continuous dielectric@xcite or as a collection of polarizable ( and chargeable ) atoms.@xcite    most of these models treat the applied electric field , and the corresponding molecule+np response , in the frequency domain , i.e. , assuming a monochromatic sinusoidal em perturbation acting on the system . while this is in principle a very general approach ( any time - dependent em field can be fourier - decomposed in a superposition of sinusoidal monochromatic fields ) , it is not the only one .",
    "a fully real - time description of optical phenomena involving molecules is also possible , i.e. , a numerical approach that solves the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( or the time - dependent kohn - sham equation for time dependent density functional theory , tddft , approaches ) for the molecule in the presence of a time - dependent field .",
    "such real - time description is quite suitable when one wants to simulate the interaction of molecules with short light pulses ( that span many frequencies ) such as those employed in ultrafast spectroscopies , also in the presence of plasmonic nanostructures.@xcite it is also a convenient approach for non - linear optical properties simulations.@xcite finally , a real - time description also offers an alternative way to interpret optical phenomena involving molecules , that may disclose more clearly the physics taking place in the system.@xcite on the down side , real - time description typically requires large computational efforts if fine features in a spectra should be solved , and many of the analysis that are straightforward in the frequency domain ( e.g. , orbital excitations contributing to a given transition ; inspection of the transition density ) requires extra steps .    in this work",
    "we shall present an evolution of the polarizable continuum model ( pcm)@xcite - inspired approach that has been developed in the past to treat optical properties of molecules close to metal np@xcite to the real - time domain . in that model ,",
    "the molecule was treated initially with hartree - fock / time dependent hartree fock ( hf / tdhf)@xcite and then by dft / tddft@xcite and zindo,@xcite and was coupled to a classical dielectric description of the metal np employing an empirical frequency dependent dielectric constant corrected for quantum - size effects.@xcite the boundary element method ( bem ) was used to solve the quasi - static electromagnetic problem needed to write the effective hamiltonian for the molecule close to the np .",
    "many phenomena were treated with this model , such as sers,@xcite seira,@xcite metal - enhanced fluorescence@xcite and excitation energy transfer ( eet ) close to a np.@xcite here the same model will be extended to simulations in real - time .",
    "the optical phenomena that will be considered here is the light absorption of the molecule- np system , with the goal to extend the method to a range of phenomena in the near future .    in the field of quantum - chemical models for molecules close to nps",
    ", a real time approach has been already used in the past.@xcite the approach that we are proposing here differs from previous ones in two main aspects .",
    "the first is the choice of the quantum mechanical method for the molecule .",
    "all the cited works exploit real time tddft ( rt - tddft ) . here for the molecule we shall instead solve the time dependent schrdinger equation projected on a finite basis of multi - electronic states , obtained by configuration interaction ( td ci approach ) .",
    "the second difference is that previous works used the finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method for the np polarization , while here we shall exploit bem ( in the quasistatic limit ) .",
    "the choice of a wavefunction based method ( ci ) instead of rt - tddft is motivated by the qualitative artifacts that plague the current versions of rt - tddft when the molecular state departs substantially from the ground state .",
    "for example , the behavior in response to a light pulse that should take most of the population to a given excited state is unsound with respect to the pulse parameter,@xcite and rabi oscillations are not properly described.@xcite the cause of these artifacts is believed to be the adiabatic approximation , i.e. , the assumption that the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential at a given time depends only on the density at that time rather than to all the previous instants.@xcite therefore , although rt - tddft will likely become in the future as accurate in the study of electronic dynamics as dft and tddft are now for ground and excited state properties , at present such artifacts make difficult to correctly assign the physical origin of features observed in the electronic dynamics of a molecule close to a metal np .",
    "td ci offers the simplest theoretical framework to bypass these problems and has been already applied to the investigation of multi - electronic dynamics for molecules in gas - phase.@xcite here , we shall limit ourselves to the simplest ci method , ci single ( cis ) . although cis is known to have a limited accuracy in terms of excitation energies,@xcite it provides qualitatively correct behaviors also for charge transfer states , and can be systematically improved ( e.g. , the cis(d ) correction has been already used in a td context).@xcite    the classical electromagnetic description of the np via bem is an alternative approach to fdtd .",
    "bem and fdtd are both widespread methods to study plasmonic nanosystems.@xcite here , bem has some computational advantages when coupled to a molecule described with a localized basis set , that will be discussed in the theoretical section .",
    "bem is most naturally a technique applied in the frequency domain , and needs to be translated to the time domain to be directly coupled to td ci .",
    "we have recently investigated the electronic dynamics of molecules in solution by a novel extension to the time domain of the polarizable continuum model ( pcm ) implicit solvation approach.@xcite to this aim , we have developed equations of motion ( eoms ) for the apparent charges that describe the evolution of time - dependent solvent polarization .",
    "such eoms are able to describe the delayed solvent response coded in the debye dielectric constant .",
    "formally , the electrostatic problem involved in pcm and in a quasistatic bem description of a molecule close to a continuous metal np is the same.@xcite as such , the eom method developed in ref .",
    "can be extended to nps as well , as anticipated in that work . however , the debye dielectric constant used there is not appropriate for metal nps",
    ". therefore , here we shall develop eom suitable for the more complex drude - lorentz dielectric function,@xcite and adopt a numerical approach consistent with such eoms .",
    "the real - time td ci coupled with eom bem evolution is implemented in the stand - alone home - made software wavet that is interfaced with a local version of the widespread quantum chemistry code gamess.@xcite    the article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theo ] we shall present the theoretical basis of the current approach , including the derivation of the eom for the np apparent charges that originates from the drude - lorentz dielectric function .",
    "then , in section [ sec : res ] , we shall apply this theory to study the absorption spectrum of a molecule close to a complex - shaped metal np .",
    "finally , we shall draw the conclusions and discuss the development perspectives of this modeling approach .",
    "the basic features of the model we are using for a molecule close to a np has been already described elsewhere.@xcite here we summarize them shortly .",
    "the np is described as a continuous dielectric with a complex shape and characterized , in the present work , by a drude - lorentz dielectric function @xmath0:@xcite @xmath1 the metal np is polarized by both the externally applied , incident time - dependent electric field @xmath2 , and by the time - dependent em field originated by the time - varying electronic charge density of the molecule . in turn ,",
    "such two polarizations create time - dependent electric fields ( sometimes dubbed reflected field @xmath3 and image or polarization field @xmath4 , respectively)@xcite that act on the molecule . in the quasistatic limit ( i.e. , in the limit of electric field wavelength much larger than the np)@xcite such electric fields",
    "are locally associated to time - dependent electrostatic potentials ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) that satisfy proper quasi - static poisson equations and the electrostatic boundary conditions at the np surface.@xcite following standard integral equation theory and boundary elements method , ( ief - bem ) each of these electrostatic potentials ( reflected and image ) can be written as originated by a proper set of point charges ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) located in representative points on the np",

    "<S> the optical properties of molecules close to plasmonic nanostructures greatly differ from their isolated molecule counterparts . to theoretically investigate such systems in a quantum chemistry perspective , one has to take into account that the plasmonic nanostructure ( e.g. , a metal nanoparticle - np ) is often too large to be treated atomistically . </S>",
