    "we see that the error is reduced significantly by using the iterated polynomial approximation without increasing the degree of the polynomial . for non - smooth function ,",
    "the maximum error is reduced more than 50% by the third polynomial .",
    "it is also seen from figure [ fig : error - iterated - bernstein - poly - not - differentiable - function ] that unlike the classical polynomial approximation the iterated polynomial approximation @xmath145 seems not to preserve the convexity of @xmath4 for @xmath136 in this case when @xmath4 is not smooth .",
    "so it is necessary for @xmath145 to preserve the convexity of @xmath4 that @xmath4 is smooth and @xmath56 is not too close to zero . for applications in numerical integrals and computer graphics ,",
    "sometimes it is even much more expensive to evaluate the function @xmath4 than the simple algebraic calculations .",
    "so it is significant to apply the iterated or the `` optimal '' , if @xmath4 is infinitely differentiable , polynomial approximation ."
