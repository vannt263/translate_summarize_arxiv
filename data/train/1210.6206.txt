    "comparing heavy ion collisions to more elementary collisions like pp the prominent experimentally observable effects of jet quenching are the decrease of the jet yield , energy imbalance of di - jet events , and the modification of the fragmentation function and the angular distribution of energy with respect to the jet axis .    at the lhc , rates are high at transverse energies where jets can be reconstructed above the fluctuations of the background energy contribution from the underlying event . in particular , for jet transverse energies @xmath5 the influence of the underlying event is relatively small allowing for robust jet measurements @xcite .",
