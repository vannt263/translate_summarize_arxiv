    "the relationships between the mass of central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and the physical properties of their host galaxies suggest a close connection between smbh and galaxy formation and evolution @xcite . determining the range of validity of these scaling relations and where they break down will likely lead to a deeper understanding of the link between bhs and their hosts .",
    "while numerous observational studies have demonstrated the presence of smbhs in massive galaxies , there is only tantalizing evidence that the correlations also hold in low - mass systems , possibly down to globular cluster ( gc ) scales , where bhs with masses of a few @xmath5 ( commonly named  intermediate - mass bhs \" , imbhs ) have been suggested to reside ( see references in @xcite and @xcite , hereafter n08 ) . for low - mass galaxies the properties of the central bh do not appear to correlate well with host mass @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , references in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter f06 ) ) .",
    "however , f06 have shown that a tight correlation exists with the so - called central massive object ( cmo ) , the latter being either a bh or a compact stellar nucleus : @xmath7 .    within this context the system comprising sgr @xcite and the gc m54 presents an excellent prototype to study these issues on different mass scales .",
    "sgr is a disrupting dwarf spheroidal , with a constant surface brightness core of about 1.7 . at its center",
    "lies @xmath8 a stellar nucleus ( hereafter sgr , n ) made of typical sgr metal - rich stars with a scale - length @xmath9 pc , and @xmath10 m54 , a very bright metal - poor gc ( @xmath11 pc , @xmath12 ; @xcite ) . as demonstrated in (",
    "* hereafter b08 ) , these two sub - systems are coincident in position and velocity , but exhibit different velocity dispersion ( @xmath13 ) profiles , thus suggesting that m54 was born in the halo of sgr and was driven to coincide with sgr , n by orbital decay via dynamical friction .",
    "sgr is an excellent candidate for a system that would appear to have a compact stellar nucleus if it were located at the distance of the virgo cluster .",
    "indeed , the cmo of sgr appears to be a combination of the central cluster m54 and sgr , n , and the f06 relation suggests a mass for sgr of @xmath14 , in good agreement with pre - disruption estimates @xcite . here",
    "we push the investigation of the validity of the f06 relation to even smaller scales , addressing the possibility that m54 also hosts a cmo ( an imbh ) in its center .",
    "to measure accurately the density profile and center of m54 , we re - analysed the high - resolution dataset of b08 , derived from advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images taken in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 filters , with individual exposures of @xmath17s . to improve the photometric and astrometric accuracy ,",
    "the innermost @xmath18 were re - measured using romafot , a package specifically developed for crowded fields @xcite .",
    "the catalog obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m02 ) was used outside of the acs field , while stars in common between the catalogs were used to calibrate the acs photometry and astrometry ( @xmath19 uncertainty in absolute position ) .",
    "the density center was measured using the @xcite procedure : from a first guess for the cluster center , we computed the mean of the positions of all stars brighter than a given limiting magnitude and lying within a circle of @xmath20 radius ; this value was then used as the new centre for the search - circle , and the procedure was iterated until convergence . in order to limit contamination",
    "we adopted the color - magnitude selection criteria shown in fig .",
    "1a . to avoid biases and spurious effects , we considered two samples with two different limiting magnitudes ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "the values thus obtained agree within @xmath23 and we adopted their mean ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) as the best estimate ( cross - hairs in fig .  2 mark this position ) .",
    "note that this new determination is substantially different ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) from the @xcite center .",
    "the projected density profile of m54 was measured by counting stars down to @xmath28 in 30 concentric annuli around this new center .",
    "each annulus was divided into an adequate number of sub - sectors ; the resulting density is the average of the corresponding sub - sector densities , and the quoted uncertainty is their rms dispersion .",
    "the star - counts profile is well matched by the surface brightness profile ( which is unaffected by incompleteness ) ; we therefore decided not to apply an incompleteness correction , avoiding an additional source of uncertainty .",
    "the observed density profile of m54 is shown in fig .",
    "1b ( black dots ) , where we have also plotted as triangles the values obtained by splitting the first bin ( @xmath29 ) in two portions ( note that only 6 stars are found at @xmath30 ) .",
    "if the innermost ( @xmath31 ) points are excluded , the density profile is well - fit by an isotropic , single - mass king model with core radius @xmath32 and concentration @xmath33 .",
    "however , in the inner @xmath34 there is an indication of a power - law deviation from a flat core behavior : the profile rises as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "these values are consistent with those expected in the presence of a central imbh ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the observed profile is fit well by a king+bh model built as described in @xcite , with bh to total cluster mass ratio @xmath37 ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) .",
    "is marked with a red circle .",
    "( b ) map of @xmath13 over the same region , derived from the 2 deep argus fields .",
    "the circles and `` star '' markers indicate the positions , respectively , of m54 and sgr stars that are brighter than i=16 ( triangles mark foreground sources ) .",
    "bright stars tend to lower the measured @xmath13 in the pixels whose light they dominate .",
    "although the density center ( 0,0 ) has a high @xmath13 , a large region with coherently high dispersion is detected to the sw . ]      the fiber - fed flames spectrograph at the very large telescope ( vlt ) was used to follow up these findings .",
    "two observing modes were employed : the `` medusa '' and  argus \" configurations , with the high - resolution hr21 mode , covering the triplet . with medusa",
    ", 130 fibers can be allocated over a 25  diameter field , while `` argus '' covers a rectangular @xmath39 pixel field ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "some observations from july and august 2005 were downloaded from the eso archive , though most of the data were obtained on june 25 2008 .",
    "all the data were reduced in a homogenous manner using the eso pipeline  gasgano \" software .",
    "a total of 944 isolated stars were observed with medusa at radii between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , while the entire inner region of the system out to a radius of approximately @xmath43 was covered with 51 overlapping argus tiles , each of @xmath44s . a further 2 deep argus fields ( @xmath45s )",
    "were secured on the very center of m54/sgr under excellent seeing conditions ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the astrometry of the argus data was refined by cross - correlating against the i - band acs image .",
    "all the individual medusa and argus fibers were sky - subtracted and cross - correlated against an artificial template as in @xcite .",
    "velocity uncertainties , estimated from the r.m.s .",
    "scatter in gaussian fits to each line independently , are typically below @xmath47 for bright stars .    towards the center of m54",
    "our limited spatial resolution causes the superposition of many stars under a single fiber .",
    "the dispersion in velocities of these stars results in a broadening of the observed spectral lines , which can be used to measure the stellar kinematics .",
    "we used the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite to perform the line of sight velocity distribution deconvolution .",
    "bright isolated stars , observed with the same instrument , were selected to serve as spectral templates .",
    "2b shows the @xmath13 map derived from the two deep argus fields using the ppxf algorithm .",
    "the map must be interpreted with caution , since we are in a regime where some pixels are dominated by one or a few bright stars .",
    "clearly , where a single star dominates , @xmath13 will tend to be abnormally low ; furthermore , spuriously large @xmath13 values can be measured in pixels containing only a few stars with velocities on opposite tails of the velocity distribution .",
    "however , the velocity distribution will tend towards more reliable values when spectra are co - added over several spatial pixels .    as is apparent from fig .",
    "2b , there is a noticeable correlation between bright stars and those pixels with low @xmath13 values .",
    "however , one also perceives a radial decrease in @xmath13 .",
    "surprisingly , the highest @xmath13 peak ( at @xmath48 $ ] ) does not lie at the density center of the system .",
    "although this peak may be an artifact of a chance velocity configuration of the 4 bright stars that surround it , it nevertheless lies in the middle of a @xmath49-wide high @xmath13 region , so the reality of the peak can not easily be dismissed .",
    "inspection of the acs image ( fig .",
    "2a ) reveals that this `` kinematic center '' lies outside any obvious density peak .",
    "we verified that this does not correspond to the center of the metal - rich sgr stars .",
    "bearing this ambiguity in mind , we present the @xmath13 profile over the entire radial range of m54 in fig .  3 , with panels ( a ) and ( b ) obtained with respect to the density and kinematic centers , respectively . circles and lozenges mark the @xmath13 values derived from isolated stars observed in single fibers ; these values and their uncertainties were calculated using a maximum likelihood method ( see b08 ) .",
    "squares and triangles are derived from argus spectra co - added in annuli , and measured with the ppxf software ; the corresponding uncertainties were estimated by `` bootstrap - resampling '' @xcite the spectra , and re - measuring @xmath13 in 100 random simulations at each radial bin .",
    "argus pixels within @xmath50 of a star of magnitude @xmath51 were rejected .",
    "the line shows the prediction of the king+bh model presented in fig .  1 , and gives a close representation of the measured @xmath13 profile .",
    "the @xmath13 profile of the sgr population is also shown in fig .",
    "the isothermal behavior of this population seen by b08 at larger radii clearly continues inwards to @xmath52 .",
    "the data presented above allow us to address a conundrum raised in b08 : how is it possible for m54 ( with a rising @xmath13 profile towards the centre ) to co - exist in equilibrium with the sgr , n population , that exhibits an isothermal projected profile , almost constant at @xmath53 ? to answer this question , we turn to the jeans equation for a spherically - symmetric system ( @xcite , eqn 4 - 55 ) : @xmath54 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the cumulative mass inside radius @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the density , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the radial and tangential velocity dispersions , respectively .",
    "interestingly , given the sgr density profile shown in fig .",
    "1b , if we assume that the sgr , n population is isotropic , the total mass profile resulting from the jeans equation in the radial range 130  turns out to be substantially lower ( by a factor up to @xmath60 ) than that of the king model ( figs .",
    "1c and 3a ) that best fits the m54 population alone .",
    "since this is physically absurd , we conclude that the sgr , n population can not have isotropic orbits .",
    "we can now turn this argument around , to ask what level of anisotropy is consistent with the m54 mass model , since the cluster likely represents the dominant component in the center of the m54/sgr system at @xmath61 ( sgr stars and accompanying dark matter should be relatively unimportant in this region ) . hence , by assuming the m54 king model for @xmath55 , and the hernquist model fit to the sgr population for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 remain as the only unknowns in the jeans equation .",
    "however , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are constrained by the observed ( projected ) dispersion @xmath13 . a trial profile for @xmath62 , defined by a bi - cubic spline at 5 logarithmically - spaced points ( red line in fig .",
    "4 ) , was improved upon iteratively using a markov - chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) scheme with `` parallel - tempering '' chains ( see @xcite ) ; the set target was to produce a flat projected @xmath63 .",
    "4a shows that the nested system can be constructed , but it requires a high degree of anisotropy for sgr , n , with orbits being exceedingly tangential between 20200(interior to 20  the fit is based only an extrapolation of the @xmath13 profile of sgr , n ) . if m54 decayed into the center of sgr , as suggested by b08 , its orbital energy must have been transferred to stars previously present in that region .",
    "it is tempting to assume that that this would manifest itself as a high @xmath59 , as inferred .",
    "the star - counts profile of m54 ( fig .",
    "1c ) shows a sharp rise in the inner 1 , a behavior that is also mirrored in the @xmath13 profile ( fig .",
    "although the rise up to @xmath64 at @xmath65 is a robust result , the kinematic data are not as clear - cut interior to this radius .",
    "it is possible that the stochastic distribution of stars in both projected position and line of sight velocity could give rise to spuriously high @xmath13 values .",
    "indeed , we judge the `` kinematic peak '' to be such an artifact , since it appears to have no density counterpart .",
    "however , the central rise in @xmath13 around the density center is in agreement with expectations from the stellar density cusp , and since this region is relatively free of very bright stars that could bias the @xmath13 measurements , we judge that the measured rise in @xmath13 is likely real . further support for the reality of the m54 @xmath13 peak comes from a comparison to @xmath66 centauri . recently",
    ", n08 analyzed a data - set comprising acs photometry and gemini integral - field spectroscopy , finding evidence for both a power - law increase in the central stellar profile , as well as a marked rise to @xmath67 in the center , which they interpret as providing evidence for a @xmath68 bh .",
    "a reanalysis by @xcite finds @xmath69 , which ( depending on the adopted cluster mass ) brings down @xmath70 to 1/7 to 1/2 of the n08 value , consistent with the @xcite @xmath71 upper limit .",
    "the similarity to the results presented above is striking , all the more as it suspected that @xmath66 cen is the stripped core of a galaxy that was once similar to sgr ( @xcite , b08 ) .",
    "while it could be argued that the central dispersion increase in one of these systems could be due to chance stellar alignments , it would require a conspiracy for both to be affected in the same way ( especially since the discreteness of the underlying stellar distribution should in general _ lower _",
    "@xmath13 ) .    what is the nature of this central structure ? is it due to a cold dark matter ( cdm ) cusp , a population of massive stellar remnants , peculiar stellar kinematics , or indeed an imbh ? for any reasonable total mass and concentration parameters of sgr , a @xcite cdm cusp would possess only @xmath72 within the inner 10 , and so can not account for the @xmath13 rise . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "neither can massive stellar remnants be accommodated , because of the implausibly high central concentration required if the cluster has not undergone core - collapse ( like m54 and @xmath66 cen ) .    in order to explore the alternative",
    "that orbital anisotropy is the cause of the observed high central @xmath13 , we performed a jeans analysis similar to that described above .",
    "we assumed the stellar density profile shown in fig .",
    "1c and the corresponding mass profile ( leaving total mass as a free parameter ) . as before , we iterate on an initial guess for @xmath62 ( taking as a prior that m54 should be isotropic beyond 10 ) , to find the projected @xmath73 that is consistent with the kinematic observations of m54 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4b : significant , but by no means",
    "extreme , radial anisotropy ( @xmath74 at 1 ) is required in the central 2  to reproduce the rising @xmath13 . rejecting a single strongly outlying data - point ( at @xmath75 ) , the reduced-@xmath76 of this model ( @xmath77 ) is marginally worse than that of the king+bh model of fig .",
    "3a ( @xmath78 ) . while very short relaxation times in the centre of a cluster are commonly believed to lead to isotropic stellar orbits",
    ", this might not hold if there is a strong density gradient ( i.e. if there is a cusp ) .",
    "the imbh solution appears the only viable alternative , however , if the orbits must be isotropic .    as discussed in @xcite",
    ", stellar winds should provide gas to the central bh and make it emit as a radio or x - ray source .",
    "due to the possible contribution of sgr gas , such emission might be more significant in the case of the m54/sgr system , compared to normal gcs . however , the expected radio and x - ray fluxes are still highly uncertain .",
    "while no suitable radio observations are available for m54 , @xcite have studied its x - ray emission using the chandra observatory .",
    "we retrieved their data from the archive and compared the position of the x - ray bright sources to the acs image .",
    "interestingly , with the default astrometric solution provided by the chandra pipeline , their object # 2 lies within 1  of the density center of m54 .",
    "since the chandra absolute astrometric accuracy is 06 , while the systematics in the absolute position of the acs are @xmath79 , it is possible that this source may be associated with the stellar cusp we have identified . from their luminosities and colors , @xcite suggest that the 7 sources they detected in m54 are likely cataclysmic variables or low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "however , their object # 2 stands out as being the only irregularly - shaped source in this small sample , and with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath80 is bright enough to lie at the lower limit of the @xcite predictions .",
    "the data discussed above do not allow us to clearly state whether the putative imbh belongs to m54 or to sgr .",
    "however , we note that the estimated bh mass is consistent with the ( extrapolation of the ) f06 relation only if its host system is m54 since @xmath81 , while a bh 1000 times more massive would be needed for a similar mass ratio with respect to sgr",
    ". we therefore may be in the presence of a very interesting system composed of a dwarf galaxy hosting a prominent stellar nucleus , itself hosting a central imbh , and both following the f06 relation accurately - verified at higher mass regimes .",
    "if the presence of an imbh can be confirmed , it would have far - reaching implications not only for the formation of smbhs and galaxies , but also for a deeper comprehension of the unclear nucleation process . however , as we have shown , the observations can be equally well explained by a centrally - concentrated stellar population with radially - anisotropic orbits .",
    "it will therefore be very useful to explore with n - body simulations whether orbital anisotropy can be maintained in such a dense system , and to obtain higher - spatial resolution spectroscopy to probe closer to the central mass ."
