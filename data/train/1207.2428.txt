    "the energy spectrum of interacting electrons in a magnetic field displays a rich structure , which results from the partial lifting of the degeneracies present in the non - interacting case .",
    "the magnetic field case bears some similarities with the ordinary harmonic oscillator , but the coupling of the angular momentum to the direction of the magnetic field leads to a reshuffling of the oscillator energies into highly degenerate landau levels @xcite .",
    "once interactions between the particles are switched on , the oscillator states are no longer the eigenstates and in general numerical methods are required to obtain the energy - spectrum . only for two - particles and specific coulomb interaction values , exact analytic expressions",
    "are known @xcite .",
    "the effect of interactions in a quasi two - dimensional gas of electrons at low temperature has received an enormous interest due to the observation of the quantized hall effect , which shows up in measurements as plateaus of the transverse resistivity across a hall bar for certain ranges of magnetic fields .",
    "the usual connotation of the integer and fractional hall effects as being related to non - interacting and interaction electrons respectively , is somewhat arbitrary and questionable , since the electrons do not suddenly turn non - interacting in the integer hall effect .",
    "thus it is desirable to develop an understanding of both quantum hall effects based on a common underlying hamiltonian .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the classical hall effect discovered in 1879 @xcite is presently not fully understood on a microscopic level .",
    "recently , extensive numerical , first - principle calculations , became feasible using graphics computing processors ( gpus ) , and have shown the importance of interactions and the proper incorporation of boundary conditions in the classical hall effect in order to generate the observed hall potential distribution @xcite .",
    "these computations require large particle numbers ( @xmath0 ) to follow the self - consistent build - up of the hall effect .",
    "the computed distribution of the hall potential is in excellent agreement with measurements performed by knott et al .",
    "@xcite and its possible implications for the quantum hall effect are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the converged solutions small regions next to the two contacts emerge , where the complete hall potential drops over a tiny region in space .",
    "the continuum - solution based on conformal - mappings of the potentials contains a divergence of the electric field strength .",
    "the existence of such singularities points to non - trivial physics near the contacts , since a linear - response theory ( based on zero bias - voltage ) can not spontaneously generate such points for a non - zero bias voltage .",
    "this motivates the search for possible similarities between the classical and quantum hall effects and highlights the need to understand the importance of interactions in all incarnations of the hall effects .    .",
    "[ fig : spectrum],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    here , for simplicity , i will focus on model systems with fixed electron numbers and not discuss transport properties .",
    "already the computation of the quantum - mechanical few - electron case is a difficult many - body problem .",
    "direct diagonalization methods in harmonic oscillator basis - sets are limited to small particle numbers , and interest exists to develop scalable methods from few to several hundred electrons .",
    "for the fractional quantum hall effect , laughlin developed a scalable method to sample information about specific many - body states . in the following ,",
    "i review some known properties of laughlin s wave - function and discuss how to use a classical map to compare the effect of the pauli principle with the influence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "one of my motivations is to discuss alternative methods to density functional theory ( dft ) , which employs a mapping of an interacting electron system to a non - interacting ( still quantum - mechanical ) kohn - sham system .",
    "a dft implementation has to resort to approximate functionals to achieve this mapping , since the exact functional is unknown .",
    "in addition dft is restricted to calculating ground - state properties and does not easily yield insight into the internal structure of the wave function .",
    "recently , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods have been employed to analyze electrons in magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "dmrg yields some information about excited states and the internal structure .",
    "a very different road is followed by methods which map the quantum - mechanical systems on classically looking equations .",
    "one example is coherent - state dynamics in combination with the time - dependent variational principle ( tdvp ) , which allows one to derive systematically equations of motions for variational parameters of the wave function .",
    "the basic idea is to store the state of a many - body wave function in terms of trajectories of the variational parameters , which for coherent states include the positions , momenta , and possibly the widths of the time - evolving wave function @xcite .",
    "the stationary properties of the system are recovered by taking a discrete number of realizations along a trajectory and use these as a basis set for a subsequent diagonalization @xcite .",
    "laughlin proposed another approach , which maps a specific quantum state to a classical interacting system at finite temperature . in the following , i investigate how the incorporation of coulomb interactions affects laughlin s construction .    , from left to right panel @xmath1 [ fig : corr],title=\"fig : \" ] , from left to right panel @xmath1 [ fig : corr],title=\"fig : \" ] , from left to right panel @xmath1 [ fig : corr],title=\"fig : \" ]",

    "especially the analysis of possible symmetries can be linked to the jacobi vectors , as has been demonstrated by p.  kramer and moshinsky @xcite and interaction matrix elements are simplified to integrals only involving two single - electron orbitals .",

    "the states are clearly antisymmetric under permutations of two particles and are states of angular momentum @xmath21 .",
    "these states are among the set of degenerate eigenstates of the non - interacting hamiltonian ( @xmath22 ) .",
