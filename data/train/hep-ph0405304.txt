    "in this contribution to the proceedings honoring professor yuri simonov on his @xmath5 birthday , i address some of the still open issues concerning the @xmath0 power counting for baryons .",
    "in particular , the power counting for the decay widths of excited baryons as well as for configuration mixings is analyzed .",
    "several new conclusions result from this analysis .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion is one of the methods to which professor simonov has made important contributions in his extensive work in qcd .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion was introduced by t hooft in a notable paper @xcite thirty years ago .",
    "although it has not lead to the ultimate goal of solving   qcd in its non - perturbative domain through analytic tools , it has proven to be powerful at the level of effective theory .",
    "the ability of implementing an ordering in powers of @xmath0 at the hadronic level has lead to the understanding of numerous phenomenological facts .",
    "the large @xmath6 properties of mesons and their interactions can be established with little difficulty from the topological picture provided in t hooft s original paper .",
    "the implementation of the expansion in combination with chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) in the light pseudoscalar sector @xcite is one example of how it can be made to work at effective theory level . in the other qualitatively different sector , namely the baryons ,",
    "the implementation of the @xmath0 expansion is substantially more involved .",
    "the pioneering work by witten @xcite provided the guiding ideas for that implementation , and subsequent works by gervais and sakita @xcite and by dashen and manohar @xcite established the framework for the study of ground state baryons . in this framework a key role is played by the emergent spin - flavor symmetry in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "this provides the basis for the so called operator analysis that has been applied extensively to the ground state baryons @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the spin - flavor structure can also be carried out in a less formal fashion than in @xcite by means of a non - relativistic quark picture @xcite . at the effective theory level , based on the results of the operator analysis",
    ", it has been possible to bring the strictures of the @xmath0 expansion into baryon chpt @xcite . here , and because the baryon flavor multiplet contents depend on @xmath6 , the formulation of the effective theory is somewhat complicated .",
    "the operator analysis has been further extended to the sector of excited baryons @xcite , where by now many results have been obtained @xcite .",
    "these results in particular show that the @xmath0 expansion can play an important and useful role in sorting out the apparently complicated dynamics that determine the properties of baryonic resonances .",
    "although the operator analysis for excited baryons is fairly well established , there have been a few open questions regarding the @xmath0 power counting for the decay widths , and the issue of configuration mixings , where states belonging to different spin - flavor and/or orbital multiplets , has been little studied . in this paper",
    "both aspects are addressed by means of a non - relativistic quark picture .",
    "this picture is expected to reliably determine these @xmath0 power countings .",
    "the first step towards implementing an analysis of baryons in the framework of the @xmath0 expansion is to establish the counting rules associated with the different operators that are needed in an effective theory . to proceed with this",
    "it is convenient to work in the limit where the quark masses are large enough for a non - relativistic picture to be reliable . in this way",
    "the problem of determining the @xmath0 counting is significantly simplified .",
    "because the @xmath0 counting should be largely unaffected by the quark masses , the counting established in that limit should hold also for the situation where current quark masses are small . in the following ,",
    "therefore , the discussion is based on such a non - relativistic quark picture of baryons .    using that approach ,",
    "witten @xcite showed that , obviously , baryon masses are proportional to @xmath6 while the baryon size is only affected by corrections @xmath2 . in consequence , baryons are compact systems in large @xmath6 , allowing for the rigorous usage of the effective potential approach a la hartree .",
    "a baryon state can be expressed as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are spatial positions , @xmath9 are spin - flavor indices and @xmath10 are color indices .",
    "the states defined in terms of the non - relativistic quark creation operators with the standard anti - commutation relations are given by : @xmath11 the wave functions @xmath12 are totally symmetric under simultaneous permutations of positions and spin - flavor labels , and they satisfy the normalization : @xmath13 a convenient basis of wave functions is furnished by functions factorized into a spatial and a spin flavor part added over permutations , namely , @xmath14 in particular , it is convenient to take the spin - flavor wave functions @xmath15 to belong to an irreducible representation of the spin - flavor group @xmath16 if one is considering the case of @xmath17 flavors with degenerate or nearly degenerate masses .",
    "this means that such wave functions also belong to an irreducible representation of the permutation group of the @xmath6 indices .",
    "the crucial role played by the spin - flavor group in the large @xmath6 limit makes this choice of basis natural . in a hartree picture ,",
    "the spatial wave function @xmath18 will have the form of a product of @xmath6 one - quark wave functions .",
    "ground state baryons in the large @xmath6 limit will therefore have wave functions of the form @xmath19 where the one - quark spatial wave function @xmath20 is an s - wave .",
    "later on , the admixture in the ground state of other spatial wave functions will be addressed ( e.g. d - wave components ) and shown to be a sub - leading effect .",
    "the spin - flavor wave function must be here totally symmetric , this being indicated by the upper label @xmath21 .",
    "excited baryons result from exciting one or more quarks leaving a core of quarks in the ground state .",
    "a quark in the core has , up to corrections proportional to @xmath0 , the same wave function as a quark in the ground state baryons .",
    "although only excited states with one excited quark are going to be discussed in detail , the generalization to two or more excited quarks can be carried out quite easily .",
    "the wave functions with one excited quark come in two types , namely symmetric ( s ) and mixed - symmetric ( ms ) in spin - flavor .",
    "they are respectively given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the excited quark wave function which is taken to be orthonormal to the ground state wave function @xmath20 .",
    "the mixed symmetry spin - flavor wave function @xmath24 belongs to the representation with a young tableaux having @xmath25 boxes in the first row and one box in the second row . in this case",
    ", the last index in the spin - flavor wave function is the one associated with the excited quark . the normalization of the spin - flavor wave functions is conveniently chosen to be unity so that the one - quark spatial wave functions have the same normalization .",
    "there is one point that needs mention .",
    "this is the center of mass degree of freedom that the wave functions used here do not treat properly .",
    "the effects introduced by this defficiency are in general subleading in @xmath0 and should not , therefore , affect the power countings addressed here . however , there is the possibility that countings , which are suppressed only on orthogonality grounds of one - quark wave functions used here , will be modified when the center of mass motion is properly treated .    since the contents of this paper have to do with the @xmath0 counting of operator matrix elements , it is convenient at this point to define operators in the current framework . the non - relativistic quark field operator from which the various composite operators con be built reads :",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the polarization in color and spin - flavor .",
    "a natural choice for it is just in terms of the color and spin - flavor projections , that make the pauli - spinor to be delta functions , @xmath28 note that throughout the analysis that follows all operators have the same time argument , and therefore only the position vectors @xmath29 are displayed .",
    "a color singlet 1-body local operator has the general form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is some functional operator acting on the quark fields .",
    "note here that no generality for the application in this paper is gained by considering non - local operators .",
    "an explicit evaluation of the matrix elements of 1-body operators between generic baryonic states leads to : @xmath32 the sum over polarizations boils down to a factor @xmath6 from the sum over color indices times a spin - flavor factor @xmath33 .",
    "this can be easily seen using the natural basis of pauli spinors and performing the momentum integrations .",
    "as expected , the final form is : @xmath34    as an illustration , consider the important case of the axial - vector current operator @xmath35 where @xmath36 are flavor generators . for the sake of simplicity , consider here the case of two flavors and the matrix elements between ground state baryons . applying equation ( 11 ) ,",
    "the matrix elements are given by : @xmath37 the matrix elements of the spin - flavor generator @xmath38 taken as shown in this equation are order @xmath39 when the spin - flavor wave functions have spin @xmath1 ( for two flavors , the symmetric spin - flavor states have all @xmath40 ) .",
    "thus , the result is that the axial current matrix elements are order @xmath6 . as a check , it is easy to verify that the matrix elements of the spin and isospin operators are , as they should be , @xmath1 .",
    "operators that , like the axial currents , receive the @xmath6 factor enhancement are called coherent operators .",
    "the above example leads to important implications .",
    "since pions couple to baryons through the axial - vector current , the pion couplings are proportional to @xmath41 ( @xmath42 scales as @xmath43 ) .",
    "as it is briefly discussed in the next section , this large @xmath6 behavior of the @xmath44baryon couplings demands the existence of a spin - flavor dynamical symmetry .",
    "such a symmetry is the main reason why in the large @xmath6 limit there is a simplified picture of baryons .    continuing with the issue of operators ,",
    "consider now 2-body operators .",
    "a generic color singlet operator has the general form : @xmath45 where color and flavor indices are contracted through the tensor operator @xmath46",
    ". a lengthier but equally straightforward evaluation as in the case of the 1-body operators gives the following expression for 2-body operator matrix elements : @xmath47 this can be further evaluated leading to : @xmath48    an illustrative application of relevance for baryon masses is the one - gluon exchange interaction .",
    "the 2-body operator associated with it is given by ( disregarding spin - independent pieces that are order @xmath49 and other momentum dependent terms which do not affect the point of the discussion ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the @xmath52 generators in the fundamental representation .",
    "the first term in the right hand side is the color coulomb interaction and the second term is the hyperfine interaction . applying this to the ground state baryons the mass shift due to one - gluon exchange has the structure : @xmath53 the factor @xmath54 stems from the trace over color indices . taking into account that @xmath55 , the coulomb interaction gives a contribution @xmath56 that is independent of the spin - flavor of the state .",
    "the spin matrix elements in the hyperfine term only contribute for @xmath57 coupled to zero angular momentum .",
    "thus , for states with spin @xmath1",
    "the spin - flavor matrix elements in equation ( 18 ) satisfy : @xmath58",
    "i.e. , they have a spin - flavor independent piece @xmath2 and a spin - flavor dependent piece order @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that the hyperfine interaction gives a spin - flavor independent mass shift of @xmath1 and a breaking of spin - flavor symmetry of @xmath2 .",
    "this important result establishes that the spin - flavor tower of ground state baryons has splittings that are suppressed by @xmath0 for states with spins @xmath1 .",
    "recently @xcite , a bosonic operator method has been introduced that should equally serve to carry out the derivations made in this section .",
    "the previous section gave the tools for determining the counting in the @xmath0 expansion associated with various matrix elements . in all cases",
    "the counting is in the end determined by a few characteristics of the operator being considered , namely their n - bodyness and spin - flavor structure , and as shown later , by the spin - flavor representation to which the states belong and the degree of excitation of the states ( number of excited quarks ) .",
    "this permits the implemention of the counting at the effective theory level .",
    "this section briefly outlines how this has been carried out for the ground state baryons .",
    "the result at the end of the previous section can be put in a more general framework in which the constraints of unitarity in pion - baryon scattering demand a dynamical spin - flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "this symmetry is of course satisfied by the non - relativistic quark picture .",
    "thanks to the spin - flavor symmetry , ground state baryons can be chosen to fill an @xmath16 multiplet , namely , the totally symmetric irreducible representation with @xmath6 spin - flavor indices .",
    "any color singlet operator in qcd will then be represented at the level of the effective theory by a series of composite effective operators ordered in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "these composite operators , when acting on a specific spin - flavor representation , can be further represented via the wigner - eckart theorem by appropriate products of generators of the spin - flavor group @xcite .",
    "for instance , the matrix elements of the qcd hamiltonian between ground state baryons give the masses of these states .",
    "the most general mass operators that one could write down are proportional to : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , etc .",
    "here @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the generators of @xmath16 , which in the non - relativistic quark picture are given by : @xmath67 the @xmath0 counting associated with an n - body effective operator is given by the general formula : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the order in @xmath0 of the matrix elements of the operator .",
    "the first factor in the right hand side results from the fact that in order to generate an effective n - body operator starting from a 1-body operator at the qcd level , @xmath70 gluon exchanges are necessary ( this factor is usually included in the definition of the effective operator as shown below ) , and the second factor results from the number @xmath71 of coherent factors ( the generator @xmath72 above is a coherent factor as the result in the previous section about the axial current matrix elements show ) . as illustration , consider the mass operator for the ground state baryons ( for the sake of simplicity take two degenerate flavors where @xmath73 ) .",
    "the most general mass operator one can write down is therefore : @xmath74 the first term gives the overall spin - flavor singlet @xmath56 mass , the second term gives the @xmath2 mass splittings . on the other hand , the third term , which according to the counting rule given above is @xmath56 , turns out to be linearly dependent up to @xmath2 with the other two operators , and therefore to that order it can be eliminated ( a series of such reduction rules have been established @xcite ) .",
    "thus , up to and including @xmath2 effects the gs baryon masses can be represented by the first two terms on the right hand side of equation ( 22 ) .",
    "gs matrix elements associated with other operators ( axial currents , magnetic moments , etc . ) have been extensively analyzed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the existence of a spin - flavor symmetry at the level of gs baryons suggests that such a symmetry ought to play an important role in excited baryons .",
    "an approach that has been proposed @xcite , which is the natural one in the non - relativistic quark picture , is to describe the excited baryons using a basis of states filling multiplets of the @xmath3 group .",
    "the @xmath75 group has as generators the orbital angular momentum operators .",
    "while in the gs baryons the spin - flavor symmetry is broken at @xmath2 , in the excited baryons the extended @xmath3 symmetry can be broken at zeroth order @xcite .",
    "the reason for this zeroth order breaking is the possibility of spin - orbit couplings . in the quark picture this can be easily demonstrated .",
    "the induced thomas precession term , which is represented by a 1-body operator of @xmath1 , reads @xmath76 where the parameter @xmath77 contains the details about the binding of the excited quark in the baryon and @xmath78 is the spin operator . calculating its matrix elements for excited states with the generic wave functions",
    "@xmath79 the spin - orbit mass shift has the form : @xmath80 where in the spin - flavor matrix element the spin operator @xmath81 acts only on the spin of the excited quark ( i.e. , the last index of the spin - flavor wave function ) . if @xmath15 belongs to the symmetric spin - flavor representation",
    ", @xmath82 is @xmath2 , while if it belongs to the ms representation the result is @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the spin - orbit coupling affects states in the ms representation at order @xmath39 . among other effects",
    ", this leads to a breaking of spin - flavor symmetry at the same order @xcite .",
    "this would seem to have bad consequences for the spin - flavor symmetry in ms states , but it turns out not to be so .",
    "first , the spin - orbit breaking leaves a remnant symmetry associated with states of the core of @xmath25 quarks as shown in @xcite .",
    "this remnant symmetry is broken at sub - leading order by hyperfine effects .",
    "second , as various detailed analyses have shown @xcite , the spin - orbit effects in the @xmath83 70-plet of negative parity baryons are unnaturally small for not as yet fully understood dynamical reasons ( substantially smaller than the sub - leading hyperfine effects ) . from a practical point of view",
    ", this implies that the basis of states in terms of multiplets of @xmath3 is very useful .",
    "other operators that couple the orbital angular momentum do contribute to zeroth order spin - flavor breaking .",
    "the complete analysis of the negative parity baryon masses @xcite shows in general that the zeroth order breaking is unnaturally small .",
    "the operator analysis in the case of excited baryons proceeds in analogy with that for the gs baryons , except that now one has an extended set of generators that includes the orbital angular momentum generators .",
    "the details of the procedure have been given elsewhere @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "the main point of this paper is to establish a few results of general validity and importance for excited baryons .",
    "these have to do with the @xmath0 counting for the various decays of excited baryons , and with the possible mixings of @xmath3 multiplets ( configuration mixings ) .      the original work of witten indicated , correctly as shown below , that excited baryons have widths order @xmath39 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with mesons , which become stable in the large @xmath6 limit , their widths being @xmath2 or higher .",
    "more recently , some questions have been raised about the general validity of that zeroth order result .",
    "an appraisal of the situation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the determination of the @xmath0 counting for the widths will not depend on fine details , a model for the decay process through one - pion emission can be used .",
    "the emission of an @xmath84 meson such as in the decay @xmath85 will be briefly mentioned as well .",
    "the model for the discussion is the chiral quark model @xcite in which the pion couples to the constituent quark according to @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the constituent quark axial - vector coupling of order @xmath39 . using the 1-body equation ( 11 ) ,",
    "the amplitudes for the various possible transitions are readily calculated .",
    "the first type of transitions are the ones that occur within a multiplet .",
    "the dominant amplitude for these transitions is easy to obtain using the result already derived in section ii for the matrix elements of the axial - vector currents to which the pion couples as shown by the above hamiltonian . for gs as well as excited baryons",
    "these amplitudes are in general proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "the gs widths in this case are suppressed by phase space as the baryon states for which the amplitude is order @xmath43 have mass differences that are order @xmath0 . because these transitions are p - wave , the end result is that the partial widths are @xmath59 .",
    "one such a transition is the @xmath88 transition . note that for states at the top of the gs tower the amplitude is proportional to @xmath4 , and since the splittings are zeroth order , the widths are @xmath2 . in the real world",
    "the @xmath89 is the second and top state of the tower , and its width should therefore be between the two limits . the transitions within an excited multiplet containing zeroth order mass splittings can be shown to have amplitudes @xmath90 only between states whose relative mass splittings are @xmath2 .",
    "the reason is that these amplitudes only change the core s state , and such a change can only affect the energy level through a 2-body mass operator . since the core piece of matrix elements of the 2-body operator can only be affected at @xmath1 by that change of the core state , the effect on the energy level must be at most @xmath2 .",
    "the second kind of transitions are from excited baryons to gs baryons .",
    "the decay amplitudes in this case have the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 these spin - flavor matrix elements are order @xmath39 for both s and ms @xmath93 .",
    "thus , irrespective of the spin - flavor character of the excited state , the decay rate to the gs via one - pion emission is of zeroth order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the third type of transitions are those between different excited baryon multiplets , where now the amplitude becomes @xmath94 this amplitude is similar to that for the transition to the ground state except for the absence of the factor @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the transition amplitudes between excited states are generically suppressed by a factor @xmath4 with respect to the ones to the gs .",
    "this has an important implication , namely , in large @xmath6 limit the dominant channel of decay for excited baryons is the direct decay to the ground state .",
    "if @xmath84 emission is considered , the analysis is similar except that @xmath38 is replaced by @xmath81 .",
    "the result in this case is that the corresponding spin - flavor matrix elements are @xmath1 if @xmath93 is in the ms representation and @xmath2 if it is in the symmetric representation .",
    "these countings have been used to implement the operator analysis for the decays of the negative parity baryons @xcite as well as the roper multiplet @xcite .",
    "the discussion above is valid for excited states where only one quark is excited .",
    "if more than one quark is excited further suppressions occur , namely a factor @xmath4 per excited quark . in these cases",
    "it is necessary to consider 2- or higher - body decay operators .",
    "leaving the details out , for two excited quarks the decay amplitude with emission of a single pion is order @xmath4 for decay to gs and order @xmath0 for decay to other excited states .",
    "this implies that the decay rate via single pion emission is order @xmath0 .",
    "the total width is however expected to be of zeroth order .",
    "the answer to this riddle seems to be that the two - pion emission is order @xmath39 .",
    "one way to see this is shown by the diagrams in the figure , where the suppression factor in one amplitude , the one connecting excited and ground states , is compensated by the enhancement factor of the amplitude connecting states in the same multiplet .",
    "this implies that these excited states decay predominantly by emitting two pions .",
    "there is a subtlety to be dealt with here .",
    "it has to do with the application of the same mechanism to the baryons with only one excited quark .",
    "naively , for these states the dominant contribution for two - pion emission would then be order @xmath43 , which can not be right .",
    "such an unacceptable contribution must be cancelled through the interference of the various baryonic intermediate states .",
    "this results from consistency relations similar to those that eliminate the order @xmath6 terms in @xmath44baryon scattering @xcite .",
    "this issue of consistency relations involving excited baryons in general has not been extensively analyzed , and it certainly deserves further consideration .",
    "the discussions of the decays have been carried out in a limited framework .",
    "this , however , should fully clarify the picture : for excited baryons the decay amplitudes are of zeroth order , so that when building an effective theory such as in @xcite , it is necessary to carefully trace the power counting , namely , for one - pion decays there is a factor @xmath95 whose origin is rather obvious , and the less obvious factor of @xmath43 that is shown in equation ( 27 ) whose origin is very clear in the model considered here .",
    "all large @xmath6 analyses carried out in the literature disregard the mixing of different spin - flavor as well as orbital states . as the following discussion shows",
    ", this is in most cases the correct thing to do .",
    "the only relevant mixings that are of any significance are mixings between states belonging to different representations of @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , the admixture of @xmath96 states in the ground state baryons , and/or the admixture of states belonging to the s and ms spin - flavor representations . in this subsection",
    "the @xmath0 countings for the various mixings are obtained .",
    "the hamiltonian that drives the mixings is rotationally invariant , which means that under @xmath97 it must transform , in obvious notation , as @xmath98 .",
    "it is also taken to be flavor symmetric .",
    "there is only one 1-body operator that can produce configuration mixing , namely the spin - orbit operator @xcite .",
    "this operator can only give @xmath99 mixings of s and ms spin - flavor representations .",
    "the mixing amplitudes are given by a formula similar to ( 25 ) : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is of zeroth order and the spin - flavor matrix element is @xmath1 .",
    "thus , at the 1-body level there is zeroth order @xmath99 mixing between states with @xmath102 .    at the level of 2-body operators other mixing possibilities",
    "exist , in particular mixings involving the gs baryons .",
    "a generic 2-body hamiltonian that contributes to mixing is : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a tensor operator of up to rank 2 , and @xmath105 is a spin - flavor operator that is a flavor singlet .",
    "the mixing amplitude for two generic states is readily determined by applying equation ( 16 ) . up to sub - leading terms in @xmath0 the result is : @xmath106 there are several cases to be considered .",
    "the first case is configuration mixings involving the gs baryons .",
    "the mixing amplitude with excited states having wave functions of the form given by equation ( 24 ) becomes @xmath107 where the 2-body spin - flavor matrix element is defined by @xmath108 the order in @xmath0 of the amplitude is determined by this latter matrix element .",
    "there are a couple of cases to be considered .",
    "one case is when @xmath93 is in the symmetric representation , implying that the excited state must have @xmath109 for an observable configuration mixing to take place .",
    "since the two body spin - flavor operator can be at most of rank 2 , parity conservation implies that @xmath96 .",
    "the second case is when @xmath93 is in the ms representation , where now both possibilities exist , namely @xmath110 and 2 .",
    "the most general forms of @xmath105 are @xmath111 and @xmath112 coupled to @xmath110 and 2 .",
    "the countings in @xmath0 of the various relevant matrix elements of these operators can be obtained by explicit evaluation and are shown in the table .",
    ".list of spin - flavor matrix elements relevant to configuration mixings and their counting in @xmath0 . here ,",
    "* 1 * denotes the singlet spin - flavor operator .",
    "the * indicates entries that produce irrelevant configuration mixings . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these countings imply that the mixing in the gs baryons are as follows : mixings with states in the symmetric spin - flavor representation ( which , as mentioned earlier , require the spin - flavor operator to be @xmath96 ) are order @xmath113 , while mixings with a ms representation are in general order @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the mixing effects affect ground state baryons primarily at the level of their spin - flavor representation content .",
    "notice that these mixings can only affect the mass splittings at @xmath2 as it should be .",
    "finally the configuration mixings between excited states are given by generic matrix elements : @xmath114 using the countings of the table , if @xmath93 and @xmath115 are both symmetric the configuration mixing is order @xmath116 , and order @xmath0 if only one of them is symmetric .",
    "note here that the effective operator @xmath117 , unlike the 1-body spin - orbit operator , gives sub - leading mixings .",
    "if both states are in the ms representation , observable configuration mixing only occurs for @xmath96 , and as the last entry in the table shows , this is order @xmath39 .",
    "thus , with the exception of the latter case , configuration mixings of excited states induced by 2-body operators are suppressed by @xmath0 .    from the discussion above , the zeroth order mixings affecting excited states come in two types : @xmath118 mixings that require states with @xmath102 and which mix s and ms representations , and @xmath119 mixings involving only ms states .",
    "the strength of zeroth order mixings depends on the dynamics .",
    "because this type of mixing requires spin and orbital couplings , the observed weakness of the spin - orbit coupling that consistently results from analyses of the baryon spectrum hints that the mixing effect is , for little understood reasons , dynamically suppressed .",
    "an example of zeroth order configuration mixing would be @xmath120 components in the negative parity su(6 ) 70-plet wave functions , or the mixing between an @xmath121 56-plet with the @xmath121 70-plet as noted in @xcite .",
    "finally , it is not difficult to extend the discussion to configuration mixings involving states with more than one excited quark .",
    "such mixings are suppressed by extra factors of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0 counting in baryons discussed in this paper from the point of view of a non - relativistic quark picture gives a good perspective about what the physics of baryons would be like in a world with a large number of colors .",
    "it is expected that the countings obtained here will hold also as the quark masses become small .",
    "the results show that excited baryons have finite widths in that world .",
    "this also means that a picture in which excited baryons are resonances of pions and ground state baryons is perfectly viable @xcite .",
    "the other observation is that the dominant decay channel is always the one that leads most directly to the ground state ; cascading through other excited states belonging to different multiplets is a sub - leading effect .",
    "configuration mixing is an issue that will need further understanding because it can occur in some cases at zeroth order in @xmath0 .",
    "this posses some difficulties of principle for the study of the excited baryon sector .",
    "the mixings affecting the ground state baryons are suppressed at least by one factor @xmath4 .",
    "the dominant configuration mixing in this case involves spin - flavor mixing . on the other hand ,",
    "the mixings of excited multiplets can be @xmath122 . because these zeroth order mixings are driven by the couplings of the orbital angular momentum , and orbital couplings",
    "are phenomenologically known to be small , it is very plausible that the mixings are dynamically suppressed .",
    "this is an open issue , however , which deserves further scrutiny .",
    "it is not quite clear how well or how poorly the general structures implied by the countings just discussed survive in the real world with @xmath123 .",
    "this is a difficult issue involving the convergence of the expansion that is far from being established .",
    "further phenomenological analyses such as those carried out for masses , decays and scattering , and the applications of the expansion to lattice qcd simulations of excited baryon will eventually clarify the issue .",
    "i would like to thank professor yuri simonov for enlightening discussions about the @xmath124 expansion during his visit to jefferson lab .",
    "i would also like to thank winston roberts for pointing out the importance of the two - pion decay channels , carlos schat and norberto scoccola for very useful discussions on the problems addressed in this paper , and richard lebed for a discussion that served to expose a mistake in the first version of this paper .",
