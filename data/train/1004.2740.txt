    "despite years of intensive research , the pairing mechanism responsible for d - wave superconductivity ( dsc ) in the high-@xmath0 cuprates remains a puzzle .",
    "it is generally believed that the conventional phonon mechanism is inconsistent with d - wave pairing symmetry and not strong enough to explain transition temperatures higher than 100  k. most investigations in this direction have been focused on the pure electronic mechanism , but no consensus has been reached so far .",
    "recently , accurate experiments displayed pronounced phonon and electron - lattice effects in these materials , which are manifested by a large softening and broadening of certain phonon modes in the whole doping region . in particular ,",
    "the in - plane copper - oxygen bond - stretching phonon , apical oxygen phonon ( aop ) , and oxygen @xmath1 buckling phonon are shown to be strongly coupled to charge carriers @xcite .",
    "moreover , photoemission - spectroscopy - resolved kink structures  @xcite are probably caused by coupling of quasiparticles to phonon modes .",
    "these findings suggest that phonons are important for the physical properties of high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "various theoretical attempts have been made to understand the role of phonons in high-@xmath0 superconductivity ( htsc )  @xcite , but the answer remains unclear . in a functional renormalization group study  @xcite , honerkamp _ et al .",
    "_ found that the @xmath1 buckling phonon enhances the d - wave pairing instability in the hubbard model .",
    "more recently , an exact diagonalization ( ed ) study of the @xmath2 model coupled to phonons shows that coupling to the buckling mode stabilizes d - wave pairing while coupling to the breathing mode favors a p - wave pairing  @xcite . on the other hand , based on dynamical cluster monte carlo calculations of the hubbard model",
    "coupled to holstein , buckling and breathing phonons , macridin _ et al .",
    "_ found that while these phonons can indeed enhance pairing , a strong phonon - induced reduction of quasiparticle weight leads to a suppression of dsc  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of aop on dsc in the more realistic three - band hubbard model .",
    "our work is motivated by recent experiments showing that the distance between apical oxygen and the @xmath3 plane  @xcite , the disorder around apical oxygen  @xcite , and the apical hole state  @xcite have significant effects on @xmath0 .",
    "basically , there are two routes for apical oxygen to affect htsc : one is to tune the electronic structure of @xmath3 plane , leading to a change of @xmath0  @xcite ; the other one is to directly couple apical oxygen vibrations to charge carriers on the conducting @xmath3 plane  @xcite .",
    "here , we focus on the second route and study a strongly anharmonic vibration of apical oxygen in a double - well potential , which is evidenced in the x - ray absorption spectroscopy of several typical high-@xmath0 compounds  @xcite . for a strongly anharmonic motion in the double - well potential ,",
    "the first excitation energy @xmath4 is much smaller than the ones excited to higher energy levels @xmath5 . in this case",
    "one can take into account only the lowest quantum states @xmath6 and @xmath7 with energies @xmath8 and @xmath9 and model the low - energy motion of apical oxygen by a local two - level system represented by a pseudospin  @xcite degree of freedom .",
    "our main results , obtained by ed and constrained - path monte carlo ( cpmc ) methods , are presented in figs .",
    "[ sum2x2](b ) , [ binde](a ) and [ pdvdu246 ] . fig .",
    "[ binde](a ) clearly shows that the coupling to the aop induces a strong enhancement of hole binding energy , and this enhancement effect grows as the coulomb repulsion @xmath10 on the copper site is increased .",
    "an analysis of the contribution of different energies to the hole binding energy reveals a novel potential - energy - driven pairing mechanism that involves reduction of both electronic potential energy and phonon related energy . as a combination of increasing pairing interaction and quasiparticle weight ( see fig .",
    "[ sum2x2](b ) ) , the d - wave pairing correlations are found to be strongly enhanced by the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) coupling ( see fig .  [ pdvdu246 ] ) .    our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ model ] , we define the hamiltonian and the physical quantities calculated and discuss the choice of model parameters . in section  [ results ] , we present our numerical results and discuss the physical mechanism responsible for the aop - induced enhancement of dsc . finally , in section  [ conclusions ] , we discuss in detail our main conclusions .",
    "to model the electronic structure of @xmath3 plane and the coupling of holes to the anharmonic aop , we adopt the following hamiltonian proposed in ref .",

    "we notice that its frequency dependence is rather weak , suggesting that the isotope effect of apical oxygen on the superconductivity is very small .",
    "this is in good agreement with the site - selected oxygen isotope effect in @xmath117  @xcite .    to illustrate the effect of hole doping on the phonon - induced enhancement of dsc , in fig .",
    "[ pdave ] we show @xmath118 as a function of hole doping density @xmath119 at @xmath51 for the @xmath120 , @xmath44 , and @xmath46 clusters .",
    "the combination of the results on the three clusters shows that in a wide hole doping region @xmath121 , the d - wave pairing correlation is enhanced by the el - ph coupling , and as the hole doping density is increased from underdoping to optimal doping and then to overdoping , the enhancement of @xmath118 is weakened monotonically .",
    "the reduced enhancement of @xmath118 with larger hole doping , together with the stronger enhancement of @xmath89 and @xmath108 with increasing @xmath10 , demonstrates that strong electronic correlations and/or afm fluctuations play a crucial role in the phonon - induced enhancement of dsc .",
    "in summary , our numerical simulations show that the hole binding energy is strongly enhanced by an aop - induced reduction of electronic potential energy and phonon related energy . as a combination of two concurring effects , i.e. the enhancement of hole pairing interaction and the increase of quasiparticle weight ,",
    "the long - range part of d - wave pairing correlations is dramatically enhanced with increasing the el - ph coupling strength .",
    "our results also show that strong electronic correlations and/or afm fluctuations are crucial for this phonon - induced enhancement effect .",
