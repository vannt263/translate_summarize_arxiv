    "the large flow measured in heavy ion collisions at rhic  @xcite and more recently at the lhc  @xcite can be described in hydrodynamic models that have both a nearly _ perfect fluid _ value of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio of the quark - gluon matter produced and fairly short thermalization times that usually range between 0.5 and 2 fermis / c  @xcite ( depending on the assumptions made about the initial conditions and the implementation of the freeze - out ) . how isotropization and ( subsequently ) thermalization is achieved in heavy ion collisions",
    "is an outstanding problem which requires that one understand the properties of the relevant degrees of freedom in the nuclear wavefunctions and how these degrees of freedom are released in a collision to produce quark - gluon matter .",
    "an _ ab initio _ approach to the problem can be formulated within the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective field theory , which describes the relevant degrees of freedom in the nuclei as dynamical gauge fields coupled to static color sources  @xcite .",
    "the computational power of this effective theory is a consequence of the dynamical generation of semi - hard _ saturation scale _  @xcite larger than the intrinsic non - perturbative qcd scale ( @xmath4 ) , which allows for a weak coupling treatment of the relevant degrees of freedom  @xcite in the high energy nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "there has been significant recent progress in applying the cgc effective field theory to studying the early time behavior of the quark - gluon matter called _ glasma _  @xcite produced in the initial _ little bang _ of a high energy heavy ion collision .",
    "inclusive quantities such as the pressure and the energy density in the glasma can be written as expressions that factorize , to leading logarithmic accuracy in the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath5 , the universal properties of the nuclear wavefunctions ( measurable for instance in proton - nucleus or electron - nucleus collisions ) from the final state evolution of the matter in the collision  @xcite .",
    "key to this approach are the quantum fluctuations around the classical fields . in particular , quantum fluctuations that are invariant under boosts can be shown to factorize into universal density functionals that encode the multi - parton correlations in the nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "the evolution of these density functionals with energy is described by the jimwlk renormalization group equation  @xcite .",
    "there are however quantum fluctuations that are not boost invariant .",
    "it was observed in  @xcite , via numerical solutions ( see also @xcite for a semi - analytic discussion of some instabilities in the solutions yang - mills equations ) of the classical yang - mills equations , that rapidity dependent quantum fluctuations in the expanding glasma are unstable and grow exponentially as the square root of the proper time @xmath0 after the collision .",
    "in fact , both the existence and the specific time dependence of these instabilities was anticipated based on studies of the weibel instabilities in expanding anisotropic yang - mills plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the unstable quantum fluctuations ( initially of order @xmath6 ) become comparable in size to the classical field ( of order @xmath7 ) on a very short time scale @xmath8 .",
    "fortunately , one can isolate and resum these rapidly growing _ secular _ divergences to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the resulting expressions are free of secular divergences , and can be rephrased as an average over a spectrum of gaussian fluctuations of the initial data for the classical field encountered at _ leading order_. a similar observation was made previously in the context of inflationary cosmology  @xcite .    in a previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we developed this formalism for a scalar @xmath3 theory which , like qcd , has a dimensionless coupling in 3 + 1 dimensions and has unstable modes .",
    "we computed the spectrum of fluctuations and showed that the resummed expression for the pressure and energy density can similarly be expressed as an ensemble average over quantum fluctuations .",
    "the rapid growth of the unstable fluctuations has drastic consequences . without resummation ,",
    "the relation between the energy density and the pressure is not single valued . for the resummed expressions , while the relation between the pressure and energy density is not single valued at early times , it becomes so after a finite time evolution .",
    "this development of an _ equation of state _ therefore allows one to write the conservation equation for the resummed energy momentum tensor @xmath9 as the closed form set of equations corresponding to the hydrodynamical evolution of a relativistic fluid .",
    "this result can be interpreted as arising from a phase decoherence of the classical field configurations with different initial conditions given by the ensemble of quantum fluctuations .",
    "in this theory , the period of the classical trajectories is proportional to the amplitude of the field .",
    "anharmonicity occurs in any non  linear system and we expect the same to hold for qcd .",
    "as the different trajectories become phase shifted for different amplitudes there are cancellations resulting in a single valued relation between the pressure and the energy density .",
    "this phenomenon shares several common features with srednicki s hypothesis of _ eigenstate thermalization _ and _ berry s conjecture _",
    "berry conjectured in @xcite that high lying energy eigenstates of systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic have very complicated wavefunctions that for many purposes behave like random gaussian functions .",
    "a system in such an eigenstate would display features reminiscent of thermal equilibrium , despite being in a pure quantum state  @xcite . for a system starting initially in a coherent state rather than an energy eigenstate , thermalization would merely amount to losing the initial coherence .",
    "although these ideas where formulated in much simpler systems , they may have some relevance to qcd since here also the underlying classical theory is believed to be chaotic  @xcite .    in this paper , we shall focus on computing the initial spectrum of fluctuations in the glasma formed at early times after a heavy ion collision .",
    "the classical background field at @xmath10 in the glasma can be expressed , from the continuity of the yang - mills equations across the light - cone  @xcite , in terms of classical solutions of the yang - mills equations for each of the two nuclei before the collision . for later times",
    ", analytical solutions are not known ; however , the yang - mills equations have been solved numerically with the initial conditions at @xmath10  @xcite ; for a nice review , see @xcite .",
    "fortunately , inclusive quantities such as components of the energy - momentum tensor are sensitive only to the initial spectrum of fluctuations about the classical field at @xmath10 , which can be calculated analytically .",
    "specifically , we will solve the small fluctuations equations of motion in @xmath1 gauge , in order to obtain a complete orthonormal basis of these fluctuations .",
    "there was a first attempt to compute the small fluctuations 2-point correlator in the glasma  @xcite which , as we shall discuss , was incomplete because it did not include fully the structure of the background field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will outline the power counting of higher order contributions in the glasma and emphasize the necessity of resumming secular terms .",
    "we isolate the leading contributions and obtain an expression for the resummed leading secular divergences .",
    "we show that this expression for inclusive quantities can be rewritten as a path integral over a spectrum of fluctuations times the leading order ( classical ) expression for the inclusive quantity .",
    "the only unknown ingredient in this reformulation are the small fluctuation fields on the initial proper time hypersurface .",
    "additional sub - sections discuss gauge invariance issues and the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences . in section [ sec : spectrum1 ] , we will show how to compute the small fluctuation fields in the vacuum .",
    "we first obtain an inner product for fluctuations on a space - like cauchy surface that we use to define the orthogonality between a pair of fields .",
    "we will further prove that the inner product is independent of the chosen surface .",
    "we then show that the small fluctuation fields can be expressed as a linear combination of modes whose coefficients are gaussian - distributed random complex numbers .",
    "( this is equivalent to diagonalizing the small fluctuation correlator on the initial proper time surface . )",
    "because even the computation of the free fluctuations in @xmath1 gauge is non - trivial , we shall first solve small fluctuation equations in the vacuum .",
    "then , in the section [ sec : glasma ] , we shall solve the small fluctuation equations in the background classical field of the glasma to construct the corresponding physical small fluctuation modes .",
    "section [ sec : algo ] outlines a practical algorithm to compute inclusive quantities ( including all leading logarithms in @xmath5 , and all leading secular contributions ) as a function of proper time .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , the complexity of this space - time evolution is manageable , and amounts to diagonalizing certain matrices on the initial proper time surface . in the final section , we re - state our key results and discuss some important applications .",
    "these include a ) a systematic study of possible thermalization of the quantum system whose evolution with proper time we plan to simulate numerically just as for the scalar case studied previously .",
    "b ) the nature and role of sphaleron transitions in the early time dynamics of the system .",
    "c ) the medium modification of hard probes to study jet quenching at early times . an open question for future work is to explore until what times these analysis are valid and how one can incorporate sub - leading contributions that become increasingly important at late times .",
    "there are two appendices .",
    "the first discusses technical aspects of the computation of small fluctuation fields in the vacuum .",
    "expressions for the wightman functions for free fields in @xmath1 gauge are discussed in the second appendix , where some connections to previous work on these is also discussed  @xcite .",
    "we will begin by first outlining how the power counting for computing inclusive quantities in field theories with strong time dependent sources is modified due to the presence of secular divergences . following this power counting",
    ", we derive an explicit expression for the energy - momentum tensor in heavy ion collisions that resums the leading instabilities to all loop orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we will show that the resummed expression for the energy momentum tensor can be expressed as a path integral over the product of two terms .",
    "the first is a weight functional that samples the spectrum of quantum fluctuations on the initial proper time hypersurface , while the second is the leading order expression for the energy - momentum tensor . in the latter , the classical field",
    "is shifted by the sampled quantum fluctuations .",
    "computing the initial spectrum of fluctuations is our primary goal in this paper , the derivation of which will be discussed at length in sections 3 and 4 . before we go there , two further sub - sections will discuss the constraints imposed by gauge invariance on the spectrum of fluctuations and the nature of ultraviolet divergences respectively .      in previous works",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the problem of computing leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions to _ inclusive _ quantities such as components of the energy momentum tensor in field theories with strong time dependent sources can be formulated as an initial value problem where a classical field determined on an initial cauchy surface is evolved up to the time at which the ( local ) observable is computed . because one anticipates that a semi - hard scale @xmath11 is generated by the non - linear qcd dynamics at high energy  @xcite , a systematic weak coupling expansion of these inclusive quantities is feasible .",
    "one can formally arrange the perturbative expansion of an observable such as the energy momentum tensor as @xmath12 = \\frac{1}{g^2}\\big[c_0+c_1 g^2+c_2 g^4+\\cdots\\big]\\ ; , \\label{eq : expansion}\\ ] ] where each term corresponds to a different loop order .",
    "each of the coefficients @xmath13 is itself an infinite series of terms involving arbitrary orders in @xmath14 .",

    "their evolution with the separation scale between sources and fields is described by the jimwlk equation , which will be stated shortly .",
