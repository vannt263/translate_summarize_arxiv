    "since the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model is believed to be capable of describing the undoped precursors of high temperature superconducting cuprates , it has attracted intensive attention in condensed matter and statistical physics . through extensive explorations both theoretically and experimentally in the past decades",
    ", many properties of this model have been exposed , and a great deal of advances have been achieved . however , as the complexity occurs intrinsically in many - body systems , there still remain a lot of ambiguities remaining to be investigated .",
    "for instance , by searching for exotic states of matter or studying quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) , people usually invoke this model with different interactions on various lattices as prototypes . to name but a few , quantum spin liquid is thought to exist in spin-1/2 af heisenberg models on lattices with geometrical frustrations , but its nature is still under active debate @xcite ; whether exotic phase transitions beyond the traditional landau - ginzburg - wilson framework @xcite exist or not were also discussed by introducing more complex interactions or by tuning the spatial anisotropy in coupling strength ; and so on .",
    "it has been shown that the spin-1/2 af heisenberg system on square lattice displays @xmath8 order in ground state with the staggered magnetic moment per site @xmath9 by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite and @xmath10 by the spin - wave theory @xcite , while the one - dimensional ( 1d ) af spin chain is magnetically disordered with gapless excitations .",
    "the spin-1/2 af heisenberg chain is critical according to the exact result of bethe ansatz or the results of , e.g. , spin - wave theory with random phase approximation @xcite and mean - field approaches @xcite , which is also confirmed by using the multi - chain mean - field method associated with sse monte carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "the experiments on quasi-1d spin-1/2 af chains such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite trigger an interesting question : how does the af long - range order in two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice ( like square lattice ) in ground state develop from coupled 1d spin chains with increasing inter - chain interactions ?",
    "there are a number of studies to tackle this issue and determine the critical inter - chain coupling ratio @xmath13 : the spin wave theory gives @xmath14 @xcite , one - loop renormalization group analysis on an effectively spatially anisotropic nonlinear sigma model yields @xmath15 @xcite , the series expansion numerical techniques bound @xmath16 upper to 0.02 @xcite ; whereas some self - consistent calculations @xcite and exact diagnalization @xcite predict it as high as 0.15 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "therefore , this question still calls on further more accurate explorations .",
    "alternatively , one can also study 2d anisotropic heisenberg af models with different bond interactions to observe crossover behaviors by tuning the bond interactions .",
    "for instance , such attempts were made on honeycomb lattice with the dimer pairs pinned on the armchair bonds by using the methods of tensor renormalization group @xcite and qmc @xcite , where it is found that there is a qpt of classical o(3 ) universality from a disordered dimer phase to quantum @xmath8 order at a critical inter - dimer af interaction . in our previous work @xcite , we replaced the inter - dimer af couplings by ferromagnetic ( f ) interactions along zigzag directions on honeycomb lattice , and found that there is also a phase transition from a dimerized phase to a stripe phase .",
    "the scaling behaviors were analyzed , and the coupling parameters of two compounds were estimated by comparing our qmc calculated results .",
    "in contrast to this previous work @xcite , where the interactions are supposed to be f along zigzag direction and af along armchair direction , for the completeness of the study , in this paper we shall consider the spin-1/2 heisenberg model with mixing af interaction ( @xmath18 ) along zigzag direction and f interaction ( @xmath19 ) along armchair direction on honeycomb lattice ( fig .",

    "it should be remarked here that the present system ( we refer to case a later ) is quite different from that considered in ref .",
    "( we refer to case b later ) , and the two systems can not be transformed mutually by simply using a unitary transformation .",
    "this observation is confirmed by our qmc studies , where we observe that a small inter - chain f interaction could make the 1d disordered state smoothly crossover to a 2d spin ordered state . in presence of uniform and staggered fields , the uniform and staggered magnetizations in @xmath20 direction",
    "appear while a stripe order keeps in @xmath3 plane , and a second - order qpt at a critical staggered field is observed . unlike there is a zero magnetization plateau in the honeycomb spin ladder with af legs and f rungs in @xmath21 curves @xcite , no zero magnetization plateau exists for both cases with @xmath22 owing to the appearance of spin order .",
    "the phase diagram in a staggered field is also presented .",

    "called a worm , a partition function configuration is switched into a green function configuration .",
    "the hopping of the worm ends ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) along the imaginary time or real space direction realizes the sampling of the green functions and the ends annihilation finishes an update from an old z configuration to a new one @xcite .",
    "the big difference between the partition function configuration and the green function configuration is that the latter has an extra discontinuous worldline , i.e. , the worm .",
    "this method extends the sampling space and could be used to calculate the winding number directly .",
    "before we proceed further , we first give the definitions of relevant physical quantities that will be used later . as the calculations based on the qmc method",
    "are usually associated with the finite - size systems , where the spin o(3 ) rotational symmetry remains in a finite system , we should determine the order parameters by calculating the corresponding square values combined with a size extrapolation .",

    "it is known that the finite size gap in the zigzag chain is @xmath74 .",
    "when energy scales in the two directions are compatible , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 scales the energy in the armchair direction , the system crossovers from 1d to 2d @xcite , and in this way , the size extrapolation for the order parameter square is meaningful . in order to make a reasonable size extrapolation ,",
