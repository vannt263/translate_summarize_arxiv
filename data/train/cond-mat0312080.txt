    "to investigate the influence of vibrational motion on the transmission of electrons through a molecular bridge , we consider a situation where two metallic leads , which serve as a reservoir of electrons , are connected to a molecule through which electrons can be transferred from one lead the other .",
    "as has been demonstrated in previous work on elastic electron transport ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the transmission of electrons through molecular junctions is typically characterized by resonances which correspond to the various electronic orbitals of the bridging molecule . from the theoretical point of view",

    "the electronic parameters of the model hamiltonian ( [ e : defhs ] ) can in principle be determined by electronic structure calculations @xcite . in the model studies considered below ,",
    "we have adopted a parameterization which is based on a resonance description of the molecular bridge and a simple tight - binding model for the leads , schematically shown in fig .",

    "the molecular resonance is described by the discrete state @xmath2 and the states @xmath9 , @xmath10 represent the atomic sites of the left ( @xmath11 ) and right ( @xmath12 ) lead , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that in contrast to the lead states , the discrete state does not correspond to a single - site tight - binding description ( e.g. a single atomic orbital ) , but rather is a molecular resonance state , and thus comprises typically contributions from many atomic orbitals .",

    "thereby , the steps occur in the order as they appear in the transmission probability counted from the zero - voltage fermi energy ( which is set to zero ) . accordingly , the current based on the elastic treatment of the transmission ( dotted line ) exhibits only a single broad maximum corresponding to the position of the discrete electronic state .",
    "the inelastic current ( thick dashed line ) , on the other hand , exhibits several steps which belong to the different vibrational peaks in the transmission probability .",
    "the wide - band approximation ( thin dashed line ) is seen to give very good results except at high voltages , where the resonances are closer to the edge of the conduction band and , therefore , the energy dependence of the width function becomes important .",
    "although there is a pronounced effect of the vibrational motion on the current in model a , the influence of the coupling to the bath ( thick solid line ) is rather small .",
    "this is a consequence of the location of the discrete electronic state , which is situated 0.5 ev above the fermi energy in this model . as a result ,",
    "the current for low voltages ( @xmath125v ) is almost exclusively due to tunneling of electrons via the resonance corresponding to the ground state of @xmath91 , which is hardly affected by dissipation ( cf .  the discussion above ) .",
    "if we change the discrete state energy to @xmath126 ev ( model b ) , the transmission functions , depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : tvibf2 ] , remain virtually unchanged except for a shift in energy by 1 ev . in contrast , the current - voltage characteristic for model b , shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ivf2 ] , is qualitatively different from that of model a ( cf .",
    "[ f : ivf1 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the order of the peaks as counted from the fermi energy is reversed and therefore the low - voltage region of the current is influenced by tunneling trough excited vibrational states of @xmath91 which are more strongly affected by the presence of the bath .",
    "the current with and without vibrational relaxation thus differs by more then 50 @xmath127 for voltages in the range @xmath128 v.    the differences between the various levels of the theoretical treatment become more significant if we consider a model with larger coupling between the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom . such a situation is described by model c , where the vibrational frequency is chosen as @xmath129 ev and the vibronic coupling strength as @xmath130 ev .",
    "the location of the discrete state is the same as in model a , @xmath122 ev . the transmission probability for model c is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : tvibxd ] .",
    "it is seen that the stronger vibronic coupling results in a pronounced vibrational progression in the transmission probability .",
    "in contrast to the cases considered above , the wide - band approximation essentially fails to describe the transmission probability .",
    "it predicts an amplitude which is too small by about a factor of two .",
    "furthermore , the position of the peaks is not correctly described in the wide - band approximation due to the neglect of the level - shift function @xmath131 , and the individual peaks in the numerically exact results are narrower than in the wide - band approximation .",
    "this effect of vibrational narrowing is well - known from resonant electron - molecule scattering @xcite and results from the interference between overlapping resonances .    the effect of vibrational relaxation on the transmission probability , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : tbathxd ] , also is much more pronounced in this model than in model a. except for the lowest two peaks , the vibrational resonances are smeared into a broad hump , when vibrational dissipation is included .",
    "this is due to the fact that the vibrational relaxation process becomes more effective for higher excited vibrational states .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ f : tbathxd ] is the expansion of the total transmission probability in terms of the number of excitations in the final state of the bath , eq .",
    "( [ tser ] ) . as a result of the importance of higher vibrational states and the relatively small electronic coupling to the leads",
    ", the expansion is seen to converge much slower than in the models considered above .",
    "let us next consider the current - voltage characteristic for model c , depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : ivxd ] .",
    "it is seen that the coupling to the vibrational motion has a rather strong effect on the current through the bridge . in particular , the current - voltage characteristic exhibits step - like structures corresponding to the different vibrational levels in the discrete electronic state . as expected from the discussion of the transmission probability above , both the elastic treatment and the wide - band approximation fail severely in the description of the current .",
    "[ f : ivbathxd ] demonstrates that the coupling to the bath has a strong effect on the current - voltage characteristic in model c. in particular , the step - like structure is washed - out and the magnitude of the current decreases by more than a factor of two .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ivbathxd ] is the contribution of the different terms in the expansion ( [ tser ] ) to the total current .",
    "in contrast to the transmission probability , the expansion for the current converges relatively fast for this model .",
    "the reason for this at first sight surprising finding is that , due to the pauli principle exclusion factors in the formula for the current , terms with a higher number of excitations in the final state of the bath are suppressed at lower voltage .",
    "all models considered so far were characterized by a relatively weak coupling of the discrete electronic state to the leads , which results in narrow resonance structures . in this section we shall consider the opposite limit of a localized state that is strongly coupled to the leads .",
    "such a situation is realized in model d , where the coupling strength between the discrete electronic state and the leads is chosen as @xmath132 ev . the position of the discrete state is in the upper part of the conduction band , @xmath133 ev .",
    "all other parameters are the same as in model c. we mention that if the coupling to the bath is not considered , model d is essentially equivalent to a model studied by gelfand et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of inelastic tunneling in heterostructures .",
    "the results for the transmission probability are depicted in fig .  [",
    "f : tallaa ] .",
    "the strong coupling to the leads results in a rather broad transmission probability , which is qualitatively well described taking into account only elastic processes .",
    "vibrationally inelastic contributions to the transmission probability manifest themselves in various cusp structures .",
    "thereby , each cusp indicates the opening of a new vibrational channel .",
    "it is well - known from the theory of electron - molecule scattering that the wide - band approximation is not at all applicable in this case .",
    "the effect of the coupling to the bath , which is well described including the two lowest term in the expansion ( [ tser ] ) , is very small .",
    "this is a consequence of the strong electronic coupling which results in a very short residence time of the electron on the bridge .",
    "[ f : ivaa ] displays the current - voltage characteristic for model d. as to be expected from the transmission probabilities , the differences among the various levels of theory are small with the exception of higher bias voltages . for higher voltages , the elastic current vanishes due to the empty overlap of the left and right conduction bands .",
    "inelastic transmission processes , however , which are accompanied by an energy loss of the electron , are still allowed .    although there are no structures in the transmission probability in fig .",
    "[ f : tallaa ] which are obviously related to the position of the discrete electronic state , the location of this state does play an important role .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f : tallda ] , which shows the transmission probability for model e , which differs from model d only in a lower energy of the discrete electronic state , @xmath134 ev .",
    "this different location of the discrete state results in pronounced peaks and minima in the transmission function , which are somewhat smoothed , but not destroyed , by the coupling to the bath . to facilitate the interpretation of these structures , fig .",
    "[ f : modeld ] shows the potential - energy curve of the discrete state ( corresponding to @xmath91 ) together with the energies of the vibrational states .",
    "in addition , the potential energy of @xmath6 is shown , shifted by @xmath135 ev , respectively , to indicate the energy which electrons coming from the conduction band may carry into the bridging molecule . though the localized state is strongly coupled to the continuum , due to the shift of the two potential curves , the ground vibrational state in @xmath91 has only a small overlap with the respective ground state in @xmath6 .",
    "consequently the coupling between the two states is effectively small and sharp resonances may be observed .",
    "if the discrete state is localized higher in energy ( as in model d ) , the potential energy curve of @xmath91 is shifted up . then , the ground state of @xmath91 still has a small overlap with the ground state of @xmath6 but the decay into higher vibrational states becomes energetically possible .",
    "the sharp resonances thus `` dissolve '' in the continuum . as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f : ivda ] , the sharp structures close to the bottom of the conduction band have no significant effect on the current , and the overall appearance of the current - voltage characteristic is similar as in model d.",
    "in this paper we have studied vibrationally inelastic effects on electron transport through a molecular bridge that is connected to two metal leads .",
    "the study was based on a generic model for vibrational excitation in resonant electron transmission processes through a molecular junction . employing projection - operator methods well - known from resonant electron - molecule scattering ,",
    "we have outlined how the transmission probability can be evaluated numerically exactly within this model , without invoking the wide - band approximation or perturbation theory with respect to the coupling between the bridging molecule and the leads .",
    "furthermore , the influence of dissipative vibrational processes was investigated by considering the coupling of a vibrational reaction mode to a dissipative bath .",
    "the results of the model study can be summarized as follows : in the case of tunneling through a molecular bridge which is weakly coupled to the leads , the transfer of an electron may result in strong vibrational excitation , which manifests itself in pronounced vibrational resonance structures in the transmission probability and in a step - like appearance of the current - voltage characteristic . since in this case",
    "the residence time of the electron on the molecular bridge is relatively long , dissipative processes such as vibrational relaxation can have a significant effect on the dynamics . in particular",
    ", they result in a broadening of the resonance peaks in the transmittance and of the step - like structures in the current - voltage characteristic .",
    "furthermore , vibrational relaxation may result in this case in a significant reduction of the overall magnitude of the current . due to the pronounced effects of the vibrational degrees of freedom , a theoretical treatment which only includes elastic processes is not appropriate in this parameter regime .",
    "our studies also show that the wide - band approximation can only be applied if the electronic resonance state is situated well within the conduction band and the electron - vibrational coupling is weak .    in the opposite case of a molecular bridge that is strongly coupled to the leads",
    ", the transmission probability is typically characterized by a broad distribution , which in turn results in a rather structureless current - voltage characteristic . nevertheless , the vibrational motion may manifest itself in cusp structures in the transmittance . furthermore",
    ", sharp resonance structures may occur in the transmission probability , if the energy of the discrete electronic state is low enough and the electronic - vibrational coupling sufficiently strong , such that the vibrational ground state of @xmath91 has some overlap with lower - lying vibrational states of @xmath6 . except for the latter case ,",
    "the effect of vibrational relaxation is very small in this parameter regime .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained at different levels of theory shows that methods which only include elastic processes can give a rather good qualitative description of the electron transport in this case , although they miss the detailed cusp and resonance structures .",
    "the wide - band approximation , on the other hand , is not valid in this parameter regime ; due to the strong molecule - lead coupling , threshold effects become important which are neglected in the wide - band approximation .    to study the basic mechanisms of vibrationally inelastic electron transport , we have focused in this work on relatively simple models with a single harmonic reaction coordinate and a single electronic resonance state .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the methods employed in this work are not limited to these models .",
    "the extension of the theory to an anharmonic reaction coordinate , several reaction coordinates , and several resonance states is relatively straightforward .",
    "also , it should be emphasized that the potential - energy surfaces of such models can in principle be determined _ ab intio _ by electronic structure calculations . in this way , for example , the possibility of dissociation of the molecular bridge induced by a strong current can be studied .    finally , it is noted that in the present work the current through the molecular junction was obtained with the generalized landauer formula , eq .",
    "( [ e : landauer ] ) .",
    "although this formula gives the correct description in the limit of weak coupling between molecule and leads as well as in the situation when only single - electron processes are important , it needs to be extended for applications where these assumptions are not fulfilled .",
