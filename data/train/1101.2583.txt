    "it has been known for a long time that a spatially unbound group of stars in the solar neighbourhood is sharing the same kinematics as the hyades open cluster ( e.g. , eggen 1958 ) . assuming that it is a vestige of an initially more massive hyades cluster which dispersed with time , with the result that its distribution function is still presently evolving towards equilibrium and does not yet satisfy the jeans theorem , eggen called this kinematically cold group the hyades supercluster .",
    "more generally , it is called the hyades moving group or hyades stream , since eggen s hypothesis that kinematic groups of this type are indeed such cluster remnants has been largely debated for many years . actually , such groups may also be generated by a number of global dynamical mechanisms .",
    "most of the mechanisms able to generate such unbound groups of stars moving in a peculiar fashion are linked with the non - axisymmetry of the galaxy , namely with the presence of a rotating central bar ( e.g. , dehnen 1998 , fux 2001 , minchev et al .",
    "2010 ) and of spiral arms ( e.g. , quillen & minchev 2005 , antoja et al . 2009 ) , or both ( see quillen 2003 , minchev & famaey 2010 ) .    a way to discriminate between these two hypotheses",
    "is the  chemical tagging \" of stars belonging to the moving groups ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 , de silva et al .",
    "2009 ) . with this technique , a true eggen moving group ( or true supercluster )",
    "was recently tracked down , namely the hr1614 moving group ( eggen 1978 , feltzing & holmberg 2000 ) , in which the high level of chemical homogeneity is supporting the case that it is a relic of an ancient star - forming event ( de silva et al .",
    "conversely , the hercules stream was found to be composed of stars whose abundance pattern match that of the disk stars ( bensby et al . 2007 ) , which could be interpreted as being associated with the outer lindblad resonance of the bar ( dehnen 1998 , fux 2001 ) .    here , we intend to analyze the abundance trends of a sample of stars belonging to the hyades stream , in order to check whether it is compatible with eggen s scenario , with the resonant scenario , or with a mix of both .",
    "indeed , the evaporation of open clusters and the dynamical perturbations linked with density perturbers are not mutually incompatible phenomena .",
    "stars originating from a 600 myr old cluster had time to disperse over more than 500  pc in the disk ( e.g. , bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "2010 ) , but have retained the same guiding radius and same tangential velocity @xmath3 ( woolley 1961 ) .",
    "this does not prevent an overdensity in velocity space due to orbits trapped at resonance to overlap with this cluster remnant .",

    ", width=302 ]    the study of the kinematics of k and m giant stars in the solar neighbourhood , combining coravel radial velocities with hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions ( famaey et al .",
    "2005 ) , already indicated that the hyades stream could not be _ solely _ composed of coeval stars evaporated from the primordial hyades cluster , because the hertzsprung - russell diagram was very similar for stars in the stream and in the field , indicating a wide range of ages for stars belonging to the stream .",
    "this was later confirmed by a detailed analysis of the distribution of stars in parallax space as compared to the parallax corresponding to the hyades cluster s 600  myr isochrone ( famaey , siebert & jorissen 2008 ) .",
    "bovy & hogg  ( 2010 ) recently reached the same conclusion .",
    "moreover , at about the same time , radial velocities , masses , and metallicities of more than 14000 f and g dwarfs stars were also published as the _ geneva - copenhagen _ ( gc ) _ survey _ ( nordstrm et al .",
    "2004 , holmberg et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) , supplementing the hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions .",
    "the distribution of these main - sequence stars in velocity space confirmed that the hyades stream was the most prominent feature on top of the background velocity ellipsoid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gc ] ) .",
    "sellwood  ( 2010 ) then estimated the actions of individual stars from their observed coordinates and velocities , and examined the stellar distribution in the @xmath8-@xmath9 action space .",
    "he found about 5% of the gc stars concentrated along a resonance line in action space , which was interpreted as a signature of scattering at the inner lindblad resonance of a spiral pattern .",
    "this overdensity in action space precisely corresponds to the hyades stream in velocity space , in accordance with the model of quillen & minchev  ( 2005 ) .",
    "what is more , famaey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) compared the mass distribution of stars belonging to the hyades stream with the initial mass function of the hyades cluster and with the present - day mass function of the galactic disk , showing that it was in disagreement with the former and in agreement with the latter , thus also favoring a dynamical , resonant origin for the stream . however , the latter analysis was compatible with a proportion of at least 15% of stream stars actually being past members of the hyades cluster .",
    "it was also found that , while thin disk stars have a mean metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath10 , the mean metallicity of stars moving with the hyades ( among which only @xmath1125% of field stars from the background velocity ellipsoid , the rest constituting the hyades overdensity in velocity space ) was [ fe / h ]  @xmath12 . since the hyades cluster is also more metal rich than the field , with a mean [ fe / h ]  @xmath13 ( cayrel de strobel et al . 1997 , perryman et al .",
    "1998 , grenon 2000 ) , this could also argue in favor of a large proportion of stars in the hyades stream originating from the hyades cluster .",
    "however , this higher metallicity of the hyades stream could also indicate that its stars originate from the inner galaxy .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at determining the chemical abundances of stars belonging to the hyades stream , in order to yield constraints on their origin ( from the cluster or from the field of the disk , and in the latter case , from which typical galactocentric radius ) . in this way",
    "we shall be able to _ independently _ confirm from chemical tagging that the hyades stream can not be solely composed of stars originating in the hyades cluster , and we shall be able to provide the first _ direct _",
    "evidence for two distinct populations inside the stream .",
    "we also aim at making a preliminary analysis of the respective characteristics of these two populations . in sect .  2 , we present the sample of stars that we are going to analyze , and in sect .  3 we briefly describe the observations performed with the hermes / mercator spectrograph ( raskin et al .",
    "stellar parameters and abundances are respectively determined in sects .  4 and 5 .",
    "we then investigate whether stars in the stream are compatible with being evaporated from the hyades cluster in sects .",
    "6 and 7 , and discuss these results and their consequences in sect .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",

    "2009 ) , the thin disk metallicity in the solar neighbourhood may be evaluated at @xmath114  dex ( see also allende - prieto 2010 and references therein ) . comparing this thin - disk metallicity of @xmath114  dex with that of the stream / field ( of the order @xmath115 to 0.08  dex ) clearly supports an inner - disk origin for the stream .",

    "( 2010 ) , a resonance with the galactic bar can not account for the position of the hyades stream in the @xmath4-plane ( while it actually can account for the pleiades ) , nor for an origin farther away than @xmath121  kpc in the inner disk .",
    "on the other hand , using an orbital weighting function technique , quillen & minchev  ( 2005 ) showed that the 4:1 inner ultra - harmonic resonance ( iuhr ) of a 2-armed spiral structure splits the velocity distribution into two features corresponding to two orbital families , one of them consistent with the hyades stream ( see also sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) . to check this possibility , we performed test - particle simulations of a stellar disk consistent with the milky way kinematics , perturbed by a 2-armed spiral pattern .",
    "details about the simulation parameters can be found in minchev & quillen ( 2007 ) .",
    "we examined a range of pattern speeds @xmath122 , and indeed found that we could reproduce the position of the hyades stream in the @xmath4-plane ( using the solar motion of schnrich et al .",

    "the beauty of this simulation is that , while reproducing the hyades stream , the other orbital family creates another remarkable feature in velocity space around @xmath120  km / s , which is consistent with the sirius moving group ( see e.g. famaey et al . 2005 , 2008 ) .",
    "it is slightly shallower than the hyades stream , exactly as observed .",
    "this simulation furthermore predicts that the hyades stream originates about 1  kpc inward from the solar radius , which lies within the error bar derived in sect .",

    "this error bar is unfortunately quite large still ( 0.9    3.0  kpc ) to meaningfully constrain the simulation , and one should strive to reduce it in the future .",
    "if in the end , a metallicity difference as large as ( or larger than ) 0.1  dex were confirmed , agreement with the present simulation could only be restored at the expense of the necessity for a steeper metallicity gradient in the disk .",
    "let us however note that daflon & cunha ( 2004 ) studied ob stars , i.e. the very recent metallicity gradient , and that the gradient for older stars such as those of the hyades stream is expected to be flatter due to radial mixing , not steeper .",
    "this might cast doubt on the ability of the present dynamical model to reproduce the observed metallicity excess , should it be confirmed by further studies . on the other hand , there exists other mechanisms that could have made the hyades stream migrate from larger distances in the inner disk .",
    "it is known that stars can exchange angular momentum in galactic disks due to three distinct mechanisms : transient spirals ( sellwood & binney  2002 ) , spiral - bar resonance overlap ( minchev & famaey  2010 ) , and the effect of minor mergers on the disk ( quillen et al .",
    "one of these could be responsible for migrating the hyades stream from a distance larger than what is possible with a spiral structure model only .",
    "the `` migrating '' stream could remain coherent for a long enough time before dispersing , but more work is needed to investigate this possibility .",
    "the drawback would then be that the hyades and sirius overdensities in the @xmath4-plane would be unrelated and would need two separate explanations .",
    "from an analysis of the li , na , mg , zr , ba , la , ce , nd and eu abundances of 21 stars from the hyades stream , we performed chemical tagging to identify stream stars possibly evaporated from the cluster .",
    "the first tagging method is based on a @xmath66 test comparing the abundances of fe , zr , ba , la and ce in stream stars with the cluster average value and internal scatter .",
    "it is convenient to make use of the ` cube - root transformation ' of the @xmath66 variable to convert it into the goodness - of - fit statistics @xmath37 , which behaves as a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "this method relies of course on an accurate evaluation of the cluster average value and internal scatter .",
    "this tagging method works best for chemical elements exhibiting a steep slope with metallicity . any metallicity difference between the stream and the cluster",
    "is then amplified by each element involved in the @xmath66 sum and exhibiting a steep metallicity trend . the absence of any such metallicity trend among na and mg ( at least for metallicities in the range -0.1  0.3 ) makes them useless for chemical tagging .",
    "a second method uses the tight li @xmath72 sequence observed among hyades stars , a result of the slow li destruction process at work in these stars .",
    "stars of the same @xmath72 but of a different age , as will be the case in general for stream stars , will not fall along the hyades sequence .",
    "this method offers the advantage that the range spanned by li abundances is very large ( of the order of 3  dex ) , but is restricted to stars in the narrow @xmath72 range 5000  6500  k. outside this range , the li abundance is either too small to be measurable or not sensitive to age any longer . based on these methods , only two stars from the stream ( hd  149028 and hd  162808 ) appear to have abundances within ` @xmath126 ' of the cluster ( i.e. , @xmath78 , and matching the li sequence ) ; they thus very likely evaporated from the cluster .",
    "our analysis thus convincingly demonstrates that a large fraction of stars in the hyades velocity box ( @xmath127% ) can not originate from the hyades cluster .",
    "interestingly , 2 evaporated candidates have been found , grossly in line with the conclusion of famaey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) that about 15% of the hyades stream could still originate in the hyades cluster .",
    "it is then of high interest to clean the stream population from this evaporated population and to compare its properties with the local thin disk .",
    "it is found here that these stream stars are more metal - rich than the local thin disk , with an excess of the order of @xmath128 to 0.15  dex .",
    "this metallicity excess implies an origin for the stream at about 0.9  ",
    "3.0  kpc inwards from the sun , adopting a galactic metallicity gradient of @xmath84 to @xmath114  dex / kpc .",
    "predictions from a 4:1 inner resonance of a 2-armed spiral pattern locate the origin of the hyades stream at a maximum of 1  kpc inwards from the solar radius .",
    "a more precise determination of the stream metallicity is thus needed to confirm or contradict this scenario .",
    "besides reproducing the hyades overdensity in the @xmath129 plane , this scenario however makes another appealing prediction , namely the existence of the sirius moving group exactly as observed .    as a conclusion ,",
    "the analysis of this small subsample of 21 stars from the hyades stream has already yielded some interesting insights on its nature , and it will be of prime importance to confirm these with much larger samples , e.g. in future analyses performed with multi - fibre spectrographs such as the high resolution multi - object spectrograph of the anglo - australian telescope ( barden et al . 2008 ) . if they could derive a more accurate metallicity for the stream cleaned from the evaporated population , these large surveys could clearly provide a meaningful constraint on the distance at which the hyades stream originates , and on the metallicity gradient in the disk , thus shedding light on the dynamical process responsible for the formation of the stream .",
    "this , together with the mapping of large - scale non - axisymmetric motions ( see , e.g. , siebert et al . 2011 ) will help better constraining the non - axisymmetry of the galactic potential and its influence on the dynamical and chemical evolution of the disk .",

    "<S> the hyades stream has long been thought to be a dispersed vestige of the hyades cluster . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent analyses of the parallax distribution , of the mass function , and of the action - space distribution of stream stars have shown it to be rather composed of orbits trapped at a resonance of a density disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> this resonant scenario should leave a clearly different signature in the element abundances of stream stars than the dispersed cluster scenario , since the hyades cluster is chemically homogeneous . here </S>",
    "<S> , we study the metallicity as well as the element abundances of li , na , mg , fe , zr , ba , la , ce , nd , and eu for a random sample of stars belonging to the hyades stream , and compare them with those of stars from the hyades cluster . from this analysis : ( i ) we independently confirm that the hyades stream can not be solely composed of stars originating in the hyades cluster ; ( ii ) we show that _ some _ stars ( namely 2/21 ) from the hyades stream nevertheless have abundances compatible with an origin in the cluster ; ( iii ) we emphasize that the use of li as a chemical tag of the cluster origin of main - sequence stars is very efficient in the range @xmath0 , since the li sequence in the hyades cluster is very tight , while at the same time spanning a large abundance range ; ( iv ) we show that , while this evaporated population has a metallicity excess of @xmath1  dex w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the local thin disk population , identical to that of the hyades cluster , the remainder of the hyades stream population has still a metallicity excess of @xmath2 to 0.15  dex , consistent with an origin in the inner galaxy ; ( v ) we show that the hyades stream can be interpreted as an inner 4:1 resonance of the spiral pattern : this then also reproduces an orbital family compatible with the sirius stream , and places the origin of the hyades stream up to 1  kpc inwards from the solar radius , which might explain the observed metallicity excess of the stream population .    </S>",
