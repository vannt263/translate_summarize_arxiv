    "<S> it is demonstrated that measurements of positions of atoms scattered from a quasi - condensate in a raman process provide information on the temperature of the parent cloud . in particular , the widths of the density and second order correlation functions are sensitive to the phase fluctuations induced by non - zero temperature of the quasi - condensate . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown how these widths evolve during expansion of the cloud of scattered atoms . </S>",
    "<S> these results are useful for planning future raman scattering experiments and indicate the degree of spatial resolution of atom - position measurements necessary to detect the temperature dependence of the quasi - condensate . </S>"
