    "while we have gathered a wealth of information about accretion physics in black hole binaries in the past decades , new and improved data still uncover new phenomena .",
    "most of the known accreting black holes are transient , and undergo different spectral states over the course of a typical outburst .",
    "the two most important states are the hard state , in which a power - law with a photon index @xmath3 dominates the x - ray spectrum , and the soft state , in which a soft thermal component is dominant and the power - law is steeper .",
    "superimposed on these continua are reflection features from radiation reprocessed within the accretion disk , namely the @xmath4line around 6.4kev and a compton hump between 1030kev .",
    "these features are also subject to strong relativistic effects close to the black hole .",
    "typical outbursts start in the hard state and switch to the soft state at luminosities @xmath5 of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath6 ) or above .",
    "the soft component of the spectrum can be identified with thermal emission from the optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk @xcite .",
    "this disk provides a steady flow of material to the black hole , which is confirmed by the lack of variability during the soft state , where it is dominant ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the hard state , on the other hand , a comptonizing electron gas dominates the x - ray spectrum ( the so - called corona ) and a very high rms variability is observed .",
    "the location and physics of the corona are still unknown and with it the extent of the accretion disk .    during the hard state ,",
    "the accretion flow is unstable , i.e. , shows large aperiodic variability , and the mass accretion rate is reduced .",
    "it is likely that the inner parts of the disk are replaced by an advection - dominated accretion - flow ( adaf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or that the inner accretion disk is otherwise truncated outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . observations clearly indicate that at the lowest luminosities the accretion disk is indeed truncated at several 10s to 100 @xmath7 @xcite . at higher luminosities ( @xmath8 )",
    "most data require an inner radius very close to the isco ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although other authors found that the disk is truncated throughout the hard state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or that truncation may not be a linear function of luminosity @xcite .",
    "therefore the question of when the disk moves towards the isco remains open : is it during the brighter phases of the hard state or later during the state transition ?",
    "a further complication is that not all outbursts follow the standard evolution . during",
    "so - called failed outbursts , the source never leaves the hard state , and declines in flux before the switch to the soft state is achieved .",
    "such an outburst of gx  339@xmath04was observed in detail with _",
    "nustar_in 2013 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f15 ) . using a combination of _ swift_/xrt and _ nustar_spectra",
    "we could show that the 0.875kev spectrum exhibits a more complex reflection geometry than previously assumed , in which the reflector sees a significantly harder spectrum than the observed primary continuum .",
    "due to that complex geometry , measurements of the inner radius of the accretion disk were challenging and dominated by systematic uncertainties of the applied model .",
    "if the source goes through a full outburst , the change from the hard state to the soft state and vice versa happens rather quickly , on time scales of days ( compared to typical outburst durations of months ) .",
    "these transitions show a hysteretic behavior , i.e. , the hard - to - soft transition typically happens at higher luminosities than the switch back to the hard state at the end of the outburst . during the transitions ,",
    "the energy and power spectra often show peculiar qualities .",
    "these intermediate states were first described by @xcite and @xcite , among others , although at that time a distinction was made between an intermediate state at low luminosities during the decline of the outburst and the very high state at higher luminosities during the rise .",
    "later works recognized the similarity between these two states ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite introduced new classifications based on the spectral hardness and timing properties , the so - called hard intermediate state ( hims ) and soft intermediate state ( sims ) .",
    "both these states show similar energy spectra , in which a thermal component is detected but the power - law continuum dominates the flux .",
    "their timing properties , however , differ ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : while the hims can be described with band - limited noise components and a narrow qpo similar to the hard state , the sims power spectra are dominated by a type - b qpo .",
    "the contrast in the shape of the power spectra is very stark between these two states @xcite .",
    "these intermediate states are difficult to observe due to their short duration .",
    "they were first observed and described in detail in the prototypical x - ray black hole binary gx  339@xmath04 , which shows frequent outbursts and has therefore been regularly observed since its discovery @xcite .",
    "the most detailed study of a hims in gx  339@xmath04to date was presented by @xcite .",
    "these authors studied _ suzaku_data taken during a state transition in 2007 and find that the broad - band spectrum ( 0.7200kev ) is well described by a combination of a thermal accretion disk and a power - law continuum , with a photon index of @xmath9 .",
    "they find indications that the accretion disk is truncated marginally outside the isco , which would indicate that the disk only moves all the way to the isco at the end of the transition .",
    "the qpo frequency and behavior observed by @xcite is in agreement with predictions from the relativistic precession model ( rpm ) , in particular with lense - thirring precession of the inner accretion flow ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gx  339@xmath04provides an ideal target to be studied with the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _",
    "( _ nustar _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which allows for very sensitive measurements of the accretion geometry and the inner accretion disk radius .",
    "while the x - ray and radio properties of gx  339@xmath04are very well studied , its companion and therefore its orbital ephemeris is still unknown .",
    "best estimates of the black hole mass and distance are @xmath10 and @xmath11kpc , respectively @xcite , which we will adopt here .",
    "these are close to typically assumed values of @xmath12 and @xmath13=10kpc , see @xcite for a discussion on the impact of this choice .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : data ] we described the data and detail the extraction method of the energy spectra and power spectral density ( psd ) .",
    "the main analysis of the light curve , the energy spectra and psd is described in section  [ sec : analysis ] . in section  [ sec : summ ] we summarize and discuss our results .",

    "the aspect reconstruction during mode 06 uses the spacecraft bus star trackers instead of the co - aligned star tracker , resulting in larger positional uncertainties .",
    "consequently the source was not reconstructed to a perfect point source on the sky , but shifts by about 40@xmath15per satellite orbit .",
    "thanks to the laser metrology system the location of the optical axis on the detector is still known , allowing for an extraction of the spectroscopic and timing information and the construction of correct response files .",

    "the larger region for mode 06 data was chosen to encompass the whole source at all times , as the region was defined in sky coordinates .",
    "we carefully compared the extracted spectra and found no significant differences in spectral shape or response .",
    "we then combined the data from the two modes using ` addascaspec ` , separately for focal plane modules ( fpm ) a and b.    for time - resolved spectroscopy we used manually created good - time interval ( gti ) files and supplied them to the pipeline and followed the same procedure as describe above .",
    "the fastest time - scales we extracted were of the length of one revolution of the _",

    "this places the region on a different detector with slightly different intrinsic background , but gx  339@xmath04dominates over the background by a factor of at least 10 up to 78kev .",
    "small background fluctuations therefore do not influence our results .",
    "data were extracted using ` nupipeline ` v.1.4.1 as distributed with heasoft v6.16 and caldb files v20150316 . at the time of writing , data below 4.5kev suffer from slightly higher calibration uncertainties , due to a known shift in gain offset that has not been properly accounted for in the current response files . they have therefore been ignored in the spectral analysis but are still reliable for the light curves .",
    "as the relevant features for our conclusions ( iron line , photon index ) are located well above 4.5kev , we do not expect this limitation to influence our results significantly .",
    "all analysis was performed using the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis v1.6.2 , * ? ? ? * ) and uncertainties are reported at the 90% confidence level unless otherwise noted .",
    "we transferred the photon arrival times to the barycenter of the solar system using the standard ftool ` barycorr ` and the de-200 solar system ephemeris @xcite .",
    "as the orbit of the binary system is unknown we could not correct for black hole s movement .",
    "we use the same source regions as for the spectral extraction and extract light curves with a time resolution of 10s between 310kev and 1079kev .    to measure the power spectral density ( psd )",
    "we use the method described in @xcite to account for the variable dead - time of the _ nustar_detectors , which has typical values around 2.5ms . in this method , the psd is calculated using the cross - power spectral density ( cpsd ) between fpma and fpmb , thus removing the contribution of the ( independent ) dead - time and therefore allowing us to accurately measure the psd to frequencies above 1hz .",
    "we extracted the cpsd using maltpynt .    to calculate the cpsd we multiply the fourier transformation of the light curve of fpma with the complex conjugated fourier transformation of the light curve of fpmb .",
    "the real part of the resulting complex quantity is the cpsd , describing power in phase in both modules .",
    "as the deadtime is not correlated between fpma and b and consequently not in phase , its power is removed from the cpsd . for details about the method see @xcite .",
    "we calculated the cpsd from light curves of 64s length , extracted with a time resolution of @xmath17s in the energy range 378kev based on the combined the event files from mode 01 and 06 and used a 150@xmath15source region .",
    "the cpsd were averaged together for each satellite revolution , and geometrically rebinned with a factor 1.03 .",

    "the source softens steadily over the course of the observation , while the hard flux remains constant .",

    "the uncertainty is dominated by the larger uncertainty on the inner radius , which can not be constrained better than @xmath67 .    to investigate the dependence of the qpo frequency on energy we extracted cpsds in the energy bands 35kev , 57.5kev , 7.512kev , and 1279kev .",
    "we do not see any significant change in frequency as a function of energy , and all four energy bands give the same time dependence . while type - c qpos show a strong energy dependence in some sources if they are located at higher frequencies ( @xmath68hz for h1743@xmath0322 ,",

    "we therefore conclude that this feature is not significantly detected .",
    "we have presented time - resolved spectral and timing analysis of _ nustar_data of gx  339@xmath04 , taken during a hard intermediate state in early 2015 .",
    "the time - resolved approach was necessary as the source was softening significantly over the course of the observation and at the same time the prominent type - c qpo increased in frequency . from the energy spectra we concluded that the accretion disk is truncated around 9@xmath7 , independent of the assumed geometry .",
    "this value is larger than the isco for a spin of @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) or @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , as measured by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we note that using the relativistic effects to constrain the inner radius of the accretion disk still has systematic uncertainties , as all available geometries are simple approximations , as discussed in f15 .",
    "independent of these assumptions , the data show that within the uncertainties , the inner radius is not changing over the course of the observation , despite the observed changes in spectral hardness ( figure  [ fig : specres_parofsimfit]_e _ ) .",
    "our best - fit model assumes that the power - law continuum incident on the reflector is harder than that observed as underlying continuum .",
    "this configuration was invoked in f15 for the hard state and later confirmed by @xcite in a soft state observation , and indicates a complex geometry of the corona . using this geometry",
    ", f15 found that the iron abundance is significantly reduced compared to other models .",
    "this is not the case in the observation presented here , and all models require an iron abundance around 45 solar , similar to the values found by @xcite and @xcite , using _ nustar_and _",
    "rxte_data , respectively .      using relativistic reflection models , we find that the inner radius of the accretion disk is truncated significantly outside the isco , at around 9@xmath7 .",
    "this result is independent of the assumed geometry , either a standard disk emissivity profile with an index of @xmath35 , or a lamppost geometry .",
    "this amount of truncation is similar to the one found by @xcite , assuming a 9@xmath2black hole .",
    "this result indicates that the accretion disk does not move all the way to the isco before the source has entered the soft state .",
    "this seems to be at odds with results finding the accretion disk to be at the isco in bright hard states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand",
    ", it might simply show that different outbursts behave differently .",
    "it is in theory also possible that the truncation is not a strict function of luminosity , and truncation appears again during the hims , given its slightly different radiation balance at the accretion disk / corona boundary ( e.g. , a corona with a steeper photon index and therefore likely higher optical thickness ) .",
    "finding a truncated accretion disk in the hims nonetheless indicates that the geometry and physical conditions in this state are very different than in the soft state , e.g. , that the inner parts of the accretion disk are still replaced with an optically thin flow , like an adaf . during the switch to the soft state , which happens on a very short time - scale , the accretion disk has then to move all the way to the isco and significantly heat up . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : batlc ] , the source is in the proper soft state only 34 days after the _ nustar_observation .      despite being an ubiquitous feature of black hole binaries ,",
    "the physical origins of qpos are still highly uncertain .",
    "while qpos come in different shapes ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the most often observed one is the type - c qpo , i.e. , a strong , narrow feature in the psd on top of flat - top noise dominated continuum @xcite .",
    "different theories have been put forward as to their origin , with one of the most prevalent being that the qpo is produced by lense - thirring precession of the innermost parts of the accretion flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this model , known as the relativistic precession model ( rpm ) , predicts three qpos to be observed , all of which are produced by the same accretion flow .",
    "the lowest frequency qpo is identified with the nodal precession of the accretion flow due to lense - thirring precession and observable in black hole binaries as a type - c qpo around 0.55hz @xcite . if all three qpos are observed ( as in , e.g. , gro  j1655@xmath040 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the rpm allows for a measurement of the mass and spin of the black hole , as well as the inner accretion disk radius , independent of results or assumptions from fitting the energy spectra .     in the rpm model , which can be identified with the type - c qpo frequency , as function of inner radius @xmath74 for a given black hole mass and an assumed spin of @xmath75 .",

    "the dashed red line is calculated for a spin of @xmath76 and a mass @xmath77 .",
    "the black data points and their uncertainties show the measured qpo frequencies and inner radii ( model  4 ) in the 21 spectra . _",
    "( b ) _ same as _ ( a ) _ , but for the disk oscillation frequency @xmath78 in the gdm model .",
    "the 9@xmath2line lies outside the plot to the right at larger inner radii .",
    "the red dashed line assumes an outer radius of @xmath79 and a mass @xmath77 . ]    in gx  339@xmath04 , we only observe the low - frequency qpo , which can be identified with the nodal precession frequency @xmath80 .",
    "if we include measurements of the spin and inner radius from reflection modeling , we can investigate possible black hole masses .",
    "we follow the calculations presented in @xcite , and assume a spin of @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "using the measurements of the inner radius of model 4 , figure  [ fig : nod2rin]_a _ shows the correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath74 for different masses of the black hole , as predicted by the rpm . as can be seen ,",
    "our measured values are incompatible with a black hole mass of @xmath19@xmath2and a fast spinning black hole .",
    "instead they seem to indicate a very massive black hole around 75100@xmath2 , which is too large for typical x - ray binaries . within the rpm the sampled range of qpo frequencies results only in a very small variation of the inner radius , clearly below the uncertainties of the measured values .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : nod2rin]_a _ we can consolidate the measurements of the inner radius and qpo frequency with a black hole mass of 9@xmath2when assuming a very low spin of @xmath76 .",
    "such a low spin is in stark contrast to all relativistic reflection modeling where a broad @xmath4line is observed @xcite and also ruled out by disk continuum fitting for inclinations @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "another model to explain the origin of low - frequency qpos was presented by @xcite .",
    "these authors assume that the qpo is produced by global disk mode ( gdm ) oscillations , i.e. , by the oscillations from a disk off - set from the equatorial plane around a compact object without the need of invoking relativistic effects . in this theory the total mass of the disk plays an important role , which is strongly influenced by our choice of the outer radius when assuming a standard shakura - sunyaev disk . using an outer radius of 400@xmath7 , and the measured inner radii and qpo frequency ,",
    "we find that the data are best described with a 100@xmath2black hole ( figure  [ fig : nod2rin]_b _ ) .    however , as the outer radius is not known and can not be constrained in our spectral fits , we can also find an acceptable solution for a 9@xmath2black hole with an outer accretion disk radius of @xmath79 .",
    "we note , however , that the predicted correlation between @xmath74 and @xmath78 in that case seems somewhat flatter than what we measure , as shown in figure  [ fig : nod2rin]_b_.      @xcite and @xcite present a detailed study of the correlation between qpo frequency and spectral parameters in gx  339@xmath04using _ rxte_data of outbursts between 20022010 .",
    "they find a clear correlation between qpo frequency and photon index , which , for hard spectra and frequencies around 1hz , is linear .",
    "while their data sample a large range in both @xmath20 and @xmath82 , the sampling during the transitional state around @xmath83 is very sparse .",
    "this makes a comparison to our data not feasible , but places the unique state we sampled with _ nustar_in context .",
    "@xcite use a similar selection of _ rxte_data to compare the correlation of gx  339@xmath04to the one observed in other sources , e.g. , xte  j1650@xmath0500 and cyg  x-1 . by following the idea that the differences in the observed qpo-@xmath20 correlations between different sources can be reduced to differences in the mass of the compact object @xcite",
    ", they estimate a black hole mass for gx  339@xmath04of @xmath84 .",
    "this method requires the measurement of the correlation over a large range of qpo frequencies , in particular covering the transition regime , at which the correlation flattens .    the _",
    "nustar_data cover only a very small range of qpo frequencies , but assuming that the measured range is well below the transition frequency ( which is , e.g. , at @xmath85hz for gro  j1655@xmath040 , @xcite ) , we can fit a linear function to the correlation .",
    "this gives a slope of @xmath86 ( see figure  [ fig : qpo2gamma ] ) . comparing this to values for other sources presented by @xcite , we estimate a mass of @xmath110@xmath2for gx  339@xmath04from the scaling relation , in agreement with the mass measured by @xcite .",
    "this value is dominated by systematic uncertainties given the limited qpo frequency range covered during the _ nustar_observation and therefore compatible with the mass found by @xcite .      by combining precise spectral modeling with recent theories concerning the formation of qpos in accreting black holes , we have shown that there are still many questions left to answer .",
    "our data show that in both the relativistic precession model as well as the global disk mode oscillation model , a black hole mass on the order of 100@xmath2seems to be necessary to explain the observed combination of qpo frequency and inner accretion disk radius .",
    "as such a massive black hole is highly unlikely to exist in gx  339@xmath04@xcite , it shows that further improvement of the measurements and qpo theory is necessary .",
    "we find a significantly truncated accretion disk ( @xmath87 for @xmath75 ) but the measurement of its inner radius through reflection fitting is strongly dependent on emission geometry and inclination of the accretion disk .",
    "while we have shown that the lamppost geometry gives similar inner radii as a standard emissivity profile , more complicated coronal geometries can not be ruled out .",
    "the measurement of the photon index @xmath55 is more reliable , for which we find a tight correlation to the observed qpo frequency .",
    "however , theoretical predictions based on physical models are currently lacking , due to the fact that the physics of the corona are still poorly understood .",
