    "glass transitions and related dynamics in thin polymer films have widely been investigated by various experimental techniques  @xcite .",
    "one of the major motivations of such studies is to investigate the finite size effects of glass transitions which could be related to the cooperative motion in supercooled liquids near the glass transitions . for this purpose , the glass transition temperature @xmath5 in thin films has been measured by using several experimental methods such as ellipsometry  @xcite , neutron reflectivity measurement  @xcite , positron annihilation life time spectroscopy ( pals )  @xcite , dielectric measurement  @xcite .",
    "although contradicting experimental results on @xmath5 have been reported in the literatures , some common features seem to appear among recent experimental results  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the glass transition temperatures in thin films are lower than those of the bulk system if there is no strong attractive interaction between polymers and substrate  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the glass transition temperature in freely standing films is much lower than that in thin polymer films supported on substrate  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath0-process ( segmental motion ) of polymers in thin films have also been investigated by some techniques .",
    "second harmonic generation reveals that the distribution of relaxation times broadens with decreasing film thickness , while the average relaxation time of the @xmath0-process remains constant for supported films of a random copolymer  @xcite . in the case of freely standing films of polystyrene ,",
    "photon correlation spectroscopy studies indicate that the relaxation behavior of the @xmath0-process in thin films is similar to that of bulk samples of polystyrene , except for the reduction of the @xmath0-relaxation time  @xcite . because there are only a few experimental observations on the dynamics of thin polymer films ,",
    "the dynamical properties of the @xmath0-process have not yet been clarified in thin polymer films .",
    "measurements of chain mobility in thin polymer films supported on substrate have also been done by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  @xcite and dynamic secondary ions mass spectroscopy  @xcite . a decrease in the chain mobility of the polymer melt",
    "is observed in thin films or near the substrate by such experiments .",
    "this result appears to be inconsistent with the reduction in @xmath5 and also in the relaxation rate of segmental motions .    in previous papers  @xcite",
    ", we reported that @xmath5 for thin polystyrene films supported on glass substrate can be determined as the crossover temperature at which the temperature dependence of the electric capacitance changes drastically and that the dynamics of the @xmath0-process can be determined from the frequency dependence of the complex dielectric constant of the films .",
    "we confirmed that @xmath5 decreases with decreasing film thickness in the same way as observed by ellipsometry  @xcite and that the temperature @xmath6 , at which the dielectric loss shows the peak at a given frequency of applied electric field ( from 10@xmath7hz to 10@xmath2hz ) , is also lower in thin films than that in the bulk system , and the thickness dependence of @xmath6 clearly depends on the molecular weight of the polymer . because the glass transition temperature is directly connected with the dynamics of the @xmath0-process , the temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath5 are expected to have similarity in the properties including the molecular weight dependence . however , no experimental results which support the existence of the molecular weight dependence of @xmath5 in _ thin supported polymer films _ have so far been reported  @xcite , in contrast with the case of _ freely standing thin films _ , where the glass transition temperature is found to strongly depend on the molecular weight of polymers  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dynamics of @xmath0-process in thin films of polystyrene , especially the thickness dependence of the dynamics for a wider frequency range , including lower frequencies corresponding to the glass transition region , in order to clarify the dependence of the relaxation time of the @xmath0-process , @xmath8 , and @xmath5 on thickness and molecular weight . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt a new technique , thermal expansion spectroscopy ( tes )  @xcite , in addition to dielectric relaxation spectroscopy ( des ) . for polar materials with strong dielectric relaxation strength ,",
    "des is a powerful methods which can cover very wide frequency range from 10@xmath9hz to 10@xmath10hz by itself  @xcite .",
    "because polystyrene is less polar material , however , it is difficult to obtain significant dielectric loss signals in lower frequency ranges by des . in such lower frequency range",
    ", tes is a powerful tool for non - polar materials .    on the basis of the observed relaxation rates as functions of temperature for the thin films with various thicknesses",
    ", we obtain the vogel temperature and thermal expansion coefficient of the free volume .",
    "the fragility index is also obtained as a function of thickness and the non - arrhenius behavior of the @xmath0-process in thin polymer films is discussed in comparison with that in small molecules confined in nanopores .",

    "thin films of a - ps with various thicknesses were prepared on an al - deposited glass substrate using a spin - coat method from a toluene solution of a - ps .",
    "the thickness was controlled by changing the concentration of the solution .",
    "after annealing at 343k in the vacuum system for several days to remove solvents , al was vacuum - deposited once more to serve as an upper electrode .",
    "thickness of each film is evaluated from the electric capacitance at room temperature using the equation of the flat - plate condenser on the assumption that dielectric permittivity @xmath17 does not depend on thickness , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath17=2.8  @xcite .",
    "this assumption may not appear to be a good assumption for very thin films .",
    "however , in our previous papers  @xcite , we showed that the glass transition temperature @xmath5 determined as the temperature at which the temperature coefficient of the electric capacitance changes discontinuously agrees very well with that observed by ellipsometry even for very thin films , as mentioned in the introduction . in our measurements",
    ", thickness is determined from the electric capacitance on the basis of the above assumption .",
    "these results may lead to the validity of the assumption that @xmath17 is independent of thickness for the thickness range investigated here .",
    "thin films prepared according to the above procedure are located in air in a hand - made sample cell .",
    "the temperature is measured by an chromel - alumel thermocouple attached on the back side of glass substrate .",
    "two successive thermal cycles prior to measurements are performed on prepared thin films before the data acquisition starts in order to relax as - spun films and obtain reproducible results .",
    "in the first thermal cycle the films are heated from room temperature to 343k and then cooled down to room temperature . in the second thermal cycle",
    "the procedure is the same as in the first one except that the upper - limited temperature is 378k ( not 343k ) .",
    "even after measurements up to 378k , the samples were found not to suffer from dewetting .",
    "however , an optical microscope measurement showed that the surface of the upper electrode of the thin films was slightly rough after the measurements , while that of the lower electrode between the polymers and glass substrate remained smooth .",
    "this implies that the upper electrode does not affect the thermal properties of thin polymer films .      for dielectric relaxation measurements we use an lcr meter ( hp4284a ) in the range of frequency of applied electric field , @xmath18 , from 20hz to 1mhz .",
    "the measurements were performed during heating ( cooling ) processes between room temperature and 408k at a heating ( cooling ) rate of 0.5 k / min . from the dielectric loss data in the wide temperature and frequency ranges we extracted the temperature @xmath6 at which dielectric loss exhibits a peak at a given frequency . in order to avoid the effect of the extra loss peak due to the existence of a finite resistance within the upper electrode  @xcite",
    ", we utilized the dielectric data up to 10khz .",
    "thermal expansion spectroscopy is a new technique which has very recently been introduced in studies on slow dynamics in supercooled liquids by bauer _",

    "is involved , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the permittivity in the high frequency limit , and hence the capacitance change with temperature is directly connected with volume change in thin films via @xmath35 , @xmath31 and @xmath33 as shown in the previous paper  @xcite .    in the case of thin films of a - ps",
    "in which the area of the film surface remains constant with temperature change , the linear thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath36 , normal to the film surface satisfies the following relation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the capacitance at temperature @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a standard temperature , @xmath410.5 for a - polystyrene  @xcite .",
    "as far as the response obeys the change in external field without any delay , the phase lag @xmath28 is zero .",
    "however , if there is any dynamical process with a characteristic time of the order of @xmath42 in the system , @xmath28 is no longer zero , and hence @xmath36 becomes a complex number .",
    "hereafter , we denote @xmath36 by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the real and imaginary parts of the complex thermal expansion coefficient .    in the present measurements the average temperature @xmath24",
    "is controlled to increase with a constant rate , 0.1 k / min or 0.5 k / min .",
    "the amplitude @xmath26 is set between 0.2 k and 0.6 k. for capacitance measurements in tes the frequency of the applied electric field was chosen to be 100khz to avoid the interference with dielectric relaxations  @xcite .    in both des and tes measurements ,",
    "we measure ( complex ) capacitance of thin films , and hence we use the same sample for the two different measurements .",
    "if @xmath47 and @xmath18 is varied at a fixed temperature , we obtain the data of the frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant .",
    "if @xmath18 is fixed to be a high frequency , for example , 100khz and @xmath48 is varied at a given temperature , we are able to perform tes measurement on the _ same sample _ which are used for des measurements .",
    "for this reason , we can obtain dynamical properties in a wider frequency range from 10@xmath1hz to 10@xmath2hz even for less polar material such as a - ps by combining two powerful methods des and tes .",
    "figure 1 displays the temperature dependence of both the real and imaginary parts @xmath49 and @xmath46 measured by tes for thin films of a - ps with film thickness 18 nm and 247 nm and @xmath11= 6.7@xmath1210@xmath14 .",
    "the modulation frequencies of temperature , @xmath48 , are 2.1mhz and 16.7mhz .",
    "the peak temperature @xmath6 at which the imaginary part of @xmath43 has a maximum at a given frequency @xmath48 shifts to a lower temperature with decreasing film thickness . at the same time , the width in the temperature domain of the transition region between the glassy state and the liquid state becomes broader as the thickness decreases ; @xmath5015k for @xmath33=247 nm and @xmath5030k for @xmath33=18 nm . this corresponds to the fact that the distribution of the relaxation times of the @xmath0-process becomes broader with decreasing film thickness .",
    "our recent measurements of dielectric relaxation in thin films of a - ps have also revealed the broadening of the dielectric loss peak not only in the temperature domain but also in the frequency domain at frequencies above 100hz  @xcite .",
    "ellipsometric studies also support the results observed in the dielectric measurements  @xcite . the broadening observed in the present tes measurements near @xmath5",
    "suggests that there is a distribution in @xmath5 within the thin polymer layers and that the distribution becomes broader in thinner films .",
    "the solid curves in fig.1 are reproduced by combining the following two equations .",
    "one is the havriliak - negami equation which can empirically describe the frequency dependence of susceptibility @xmath51  @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath20=2@xmath53 , @xmath54 is the frequency of the applied external field , @xmath55 is the relaxation strength , @xmath56 is the relaxation time , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the shape parameters .",
    "the second one is the vogel - fulcher law which can widely be used to describe the temperature dependence of the relaxation time @xmath8 of the @xmath0-process : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the apparent activation energy , @xmath61 is the vogel temperature , and @xmath62 is the relaxation time at high temperatures  @xcite . in this analysis",
    ", it is assumed that the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in eq.([hn ] ) are independent of temperature and that @xmath56=@xmath8 .",
    "the parameters used in fig.1 are listed in table i. inserting the shape parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 into the empirical relation involving @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath63 , @xmath64  @xcite , we obtain the stretching parameter @xmath63 in the relaxation function described by the stretched exponential function , @xmath65 .",
    "the values of @xmath63 obtained in this manner are @xmath63=0.2 and 0.3 for @xmath33=18 nm and 247 nm , respectively .",
    "because the smaller value of @xmath63 means the broader distribution of the relaxation times , in this case , of the @xmath0-process , this result qualitatively confirms the above experimental results obtained in the tes measurements .",
    "figure 2 displays the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath6 for a - ps films with three different molecular weights for the modulation frequency of temperature @xmath48=8.3mhz .",
    "since the relaxation time corresponding to this frequency is of the order of @xmath66 sec , @xmath67 , a macroscopic time scale , the temperature @xmath6 can be regarded as the glass transition temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this definition of @xmath5 has been supported by several experiments .",
    "for example , hensel and schick showed that the calorimetric glass transition temperature determined by dsc ( differential thermal calorimetry ) during linear cooling with the rate of @xmath6810 k / min corresponds to the temperature at which a structural relaxation time is about 100 sec by temperature - modulated dsc  @xcite .",
    "et  al . _ measured the glass transition temperatures using capacitive high - frequency detection in temperature ramping as well as in harmonic temperature cycling experiments .",
    "they found that @xmath5 determined during cooling with the rate of @xmath6810 k / min corresponds to an average structural relaxation time of about 700sec  @xcite .    according to the above definition",
    "we can see in fig.2 that the glass transition temperature thus obtained decreases slightly with decreasing film thickness down to a critical thickness @xmath69 .",
    "below @xmath69 , @xmath5 decreases much more rapidly with decreasing film thickness .",
    "the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath5 below @xmath69 seems to be fitted by a linear function of @xmath33 .",
    "( note that the horizontal axis is on a logarithmic scale in fig.2 . ) furthermore , the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath5 clearly depends on the molecular weight of the polymer . as @xmath11 increases , the critical thickness @xmath69 increases and the slope of @xmath5 with @xmath33 below @xmath69 also changes with @xmath11 .    as listed in table",
    "ii , the values of @xmath69 changes with @xmath11 in accordance with the radius of gyration @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "this implies the existence of strong correlation between @xmath69 and @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath33 dependence observed in the present measurements is similar to that of @xmath5 observed in freely standing films of a - ps  @xcite and also to that of @xmath6 in supported films observed above @xmath5 by using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy in the frequency range from 10@xmath7hz to 10@xmath2hz  @xcite . from the experimental results it follows that the @xmath11 and @xmath33 dependence can be ascribed to the confinement effects of polymer chains into thin film geometry",
    "this effect is characteristic of the dynamics of the @xmath0-process of thin polymer films and is absent in small molecules in confined geometry .",
    "figure 3 displays the dependence of the relaxation rate of the @xmath0-process , @xmath72(@xmath73 , where @xmath8 is the relaxation time ) , on temperature for thin a - ps films with various film thicknesses .",
    "we measured the temperature @xmath6 at a given frequency @xmath72 ( = @xmath18 for des or @xmath48 for tes ) using the des and tes methods and combined the two data to obtain the relaxation rate @xmath72 in a wider frequency range from 10@xmath1hz to 10@xmath2hz .",
    "the upper and lower figures are the results for @xmath11=1.8@xmath1210@xmath14 and 6.7@xmath1210@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we can see that at a given temperature above 390k , the relaxation rate @xmath72 increases with decreasing film thickness . at a temperature near the glass transition ( for examples , 370k ) ,",
    "the thickness dependence of @xmath72 is much more enhanced , @xmath67 , there is a larger shift in @xmath72 near @xmath5 than at higher temperatures for the same amount of change in thickness . from this result",
    "it follows that the thickness at which the finite size effect begins to appear increases as the temperature approaches the glass transition temperature .",
    "this fact is consistent with the physical picture of adam and gibbs that the size of the _ cooperatively rearranging region _ ( crr )",
    "@xmath74 increases as the temperature approaches @xmath5 from higher temperatures  @xcite , where the crr is a domain in which all molecules move cooperatively .",
    "if the system size becomes smaller and is comparable to @xmath74 , the dynamics should change significantly from those in the bulk system . it is expected that as @xmath74 increases the thickness at which any change in the dynamics occurs becomes larger . _ the present experimental result of @xmath75 does qualitatively agree with the model with the growing crr_. this behavior has been observed in thin a - ps films with the two different molecular weights .",
    "the similar system size dependence of the relaxation rate of the @xmath0-process has also been observed for the @xmath0-process of small molecules confined in nanopores by using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "such a system size dependence may be characteristic of the dynamics of the confined geometry .",
    "in fig.3 it can be seen that there is the molecular weight dependence of the relaxation dynamics of the @xmath0-process in thinner films . in order to extract the molecular weight and thickness dependence of @xmath72",
    ", the observed values of @xmath72 are fitted to the vft equation and the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 are obtained as functions of @xmath33 for two different molecular weights .",
    "we tried fitting procedures in two different ways : 1 ) all the three fitting parameters @xmath62 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are adjusted to reproduce the observed values , 2 ) two parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 are adjusted on condition that the parameter @xmath62 is fixed to be a value obtained for the bulk films .",
    "the assumption in the case 2 ) corresponds to the one that @xmath62 is independent of thickness , _",
    "i.e. _ , the relaxation times at high temperatures are the same regardless of thickness .",
    "figure 4 displays the thickness dependence of @xmath61 for thin films of a - ps with @xmath11=1.8@xmath1210@xmath14 and 6.7 @xmath1210@xmath14 .",

    "the values are obtained by fitting the thickness dependence of @xmath72 for the bulk sample to eq.([vft ] ) . in fig.4",
    "we can see that the vogel temperature decreases with decreasing thickness in the similar way to the glass transition temperature ( fig.2 ) except that there is the difference ( @xmath5050k ) in absolute values between @xmath61 and @xmath5 at a fixed thickness .",
    "furthermore , we can see in fig.4 that @xmath61 also depends on the molecular weight of the polymers .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath61 could not been obtained beyond the error bars by the fitting procedure 1 ) , although it is confirmed that the thickness dependence of @xmath61 could clearly be observed , _",

    "i.e. _ , the apparent activation energy @xmath60 increases with decreasing film thickness . here",
    "we will analyze the present result within the free volume theory .    in the free volume theory of cohen - turnbull  @xcite",

    "furthermore , our previous measurements on temperature change in the electric capacitance shows that the thermal expansion coefficient of thin films of a - ps above @xmath5 also obeys eq.([alpha_f ] ) and @xmath89=2.5@xmath900.3 nm  @xcite .",
    "thus , the pals and the capacitance measurements on thin films of a - ps support the validity of eq.([alpha_f ] ) , which is extracted from the observed values of @xmath72 within the free volume theory .",

    "implies that the chain confinement effect on the dynamics of the @xmath0-process may be involved in the glass transition behavior in thin polymer films .",
    "the molecular weight dependence of the crossover thickness in thin polymer films supported on glass substrate is qualitatively the same as that observed in freely standing films of polymers  @xcite .    in order to explain the existence of the crossover thickness associated strongly with @xmath71 , de gennes proposed a model in which a new mode of chain motions called _ sliding motion _ is introduced in addition to the segmental motion  @xcite .",
    "this new motion is a collective motion along the chain , which requires a smaller free volume except for the end groups .",
    "de gennes shows that in the bulk state the sliding motion is suppressed because of the end group hindrance below @xmath5 , while in thinner films ( @xmath105 ) this motion is activated through soft surface layers even below @xmath5 .",
    "thus , some properties of @xmath5 in the freely - standing films of polystyrene can qualitatively be reproduced by de gennes model .",
    "although in the case of thin supported polymer films the situations are more complicated because of the interaction between the substrate and the polymers , the similar molecular weight dependence of @xmath69 has been observed as shown in the previous section .",
    "hence , it is expected that de gennes model may partly be applicable also in the present case . at the same time",
    ", the present form of the model can not explain the observed thickness and molecular weight dependence of @xmath61 .",
    "we hope that the model will be developed in full agreement with many aspects of the glass transition in thin polymer films .",
