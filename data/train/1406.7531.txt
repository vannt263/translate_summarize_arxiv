    "the galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) and m4 ( ) play a key role among all the ggcs , since these are the closest two globulars to the sun .",
    "unlike , m4 is located near the equator ( @xmath0=@xmath116@xmath123@xmath135 , @xmath2=@xmath126@xmath131@xmath132 ) , making it a good target for both northern and southern observing facilities . again unlike , m4 hosts a significant population of rr  lyrae variables , which offers a whole new class of observational constraints on the cluster s distance and physical properties .",
    "the main drawback of m4 is that it is veiled by large and differential reddening : e()@xmath30.37@xmath40.01 ( estimated standard error of the mean , overall range @xmath5e()@xmath6 0.2mag ) according to @xcite ( hereinafter h12 ) ; see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several studies in recent years have suggested that the reddening law toward m4 is abnormal compared to the canonical diffuse interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "these drawbacks are due to the fact that m4 is located behind the scorpius - ophiuchus cloud complex .",
    "the problem of the reddening law in the direction of m4 has been recently discussed in a thorough investigation by h12 on the basis of both optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry .",
    "its small distance makes m4 a valuable laboratory for stellar evolution studies , since even modest telescopes can provide accurate photometric and spectroscopic data well below the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "the same consideration applies to variable stars , and indeed m4 hosts a sizable sample of stars identified as fundamental ( fu , 31 ) and first overtone ( fo , 13 ) rr  lyraes @xcite , and optical photoelectric photometry has been published for a significant fraction of them @xcite .",
    "a sizable sample of eclipsing binaries has been detected and studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . a detailed x - ray and optical investigation of the innermost cluster regions",
    "was performed by @xcite , who detected a dozen chromospherically active binaries , confirmed the presence of a millisecond pulsar @xcite , and identified a couple of candidate cataclysmic variables .",
    "more recently , deep optical imaging with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has provided a very deep color - magnitude diagram approaching the hydrogen  burning limit on the main sequence , and showing the blue hook on the white dwarf cooling sequence @xcite .    a deep and accurate optical ",
    "nir cmd based on images collected with hst was provided by @xcite .",
    "they found evidence of a split in the main sequence region located below the knee .",
    "in particular , they found that one subpopulation can be associated with normal chemical abundance ratios , and the other with a composition that is enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in oxygen .",
    "this result appears even more compelling in conjunction with the results of a very detailed spectroscopic analysis of evolved and main - sequence stars performed by @xcite .",
    "they collected a large number of high - resolution spectra for more than two thousand cluster members and found that the overall metallicity is almost constant over the entire sample : [ fe / h]@xmath31.07 , @xmath7=@xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the difference in iron content between the two distinct stellar sequences along the rgb of m4 , identified by @xcite , is smaller than 0.01 dex .",
    "this is consistent with the evidence from @xcite that the difference appears to be in the cno abundances .",
    "a deep and accurate nir cmd of m4 was also provided by @xcite , who analysed nir images collected with hawk - i at vlt .",
    "their data cover a time interval of eight years , and accurate ground - based astrometry allowed them to distinguish cluster and field stars .",
    "this is a paper in a series dedicated to multiband photometry of cluster and field rr  lyrae stars . in   2 and 3 below , we present both optical and nir data sets for the variable stars of m4",
    ". then  4 deals with the reidentification and characterization of the variable stars in the cluster field , while  5 considers them in the context of the cluster color - magnitude diagram .",
    "after that , ",
    "6 discusses the pulsation properties of the rr  lyrae variables and the implications for their evolutionary status , and  7 compares and contrasts the rr  lyrae population of m4 to that of another well - studied cluster , m5 ( ) . finally ,  8 briefly summarizes the results of our study .",
    "our optical observations of m4 consist of 5,003 individual ccd images obtained during the course of 18 observing runs .",
    "table  [ tab : table_obs_opt ] is a synopsis of the observation dates and the number of exposures obtained in each filter during each run .",
    "the column `` multiplex '' refers to the number of individual ccd chips in the particular camera , which were treated as independent detectors .",
    "the multiplex factor times the number of exposures represents the net contribution to the grand total of 5,003 ccd images cited above .",
    "these observations were included in a total of 84 datasets , where a dataset is defined as either ( a )  all the digital images obtained with a single ccd chip on a single photometric night , or ( b )  all the digital images obtained with a single ccd on one or more non - photometric nights during the same observing run .",
    "datasets from photometric nights are calibrated with respect to standard stars in many fields spread across the sky , including full corrections for atmospheric extinction .",
    "datasets from non - photometric nights are calibrated with respect to local standards contained within each image , which have themselves been established on photometric occasions .",
    "( datasets from nights when science targets _ only _ were observed , with no fundamental photometric standard - field observations , were also treated as non - photometric . )",
    "color - transformation coefficients can be derived for non - photometric datasets just as for photometric ones , provided that stars of a range of color are available in at least some individual images ; this was always the case here .",
    "of the 84 datasets containing our observations of m4 , 37 were considered to be of photometric quality , and the remaining 47 were treated as non - photometric .",
    "all the ccd images were reduced by pbs using the daophot / allstar / allframe suite of programs .",
    "these data were then calibrated to the johnson _ ubv _ , kron / cousins _ ri _ photometric system of @xcite , which is designed to be as close as possible to that of @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the photometric standard values that were employed here were those current as of 2013 august 13 . by comparison with landolt",
    "s published values for stars in common , we determine that this photometric system agrees with landolt s with an rms dispersion _ per star _ of 0.028  mag in @xmath9 , 0.018  mag in @xmath10 , 0.013  mag in @xmath11 , 0.011  mag in @xmath12 , and 0.015  mag in @xmath13 , based upon 203 , 325 , 339 , 216 , and 230 individual stars common to the two samples , respectively .",
    "we believe that these numbers represent a fundamental limit to the accuracy with which these broad - band photometric indices for any given star can be transformed from one filter set to another , given the variety present among stellar spectral - energy distributions .",
    "_ in the mean _ , our system appears to agree with landolt s to @xmath14  mag ( 68% confidence interval ) in _ bvri _ and to @xmath15  mag in @xmath9 for stars in the magnitude range of overlap ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the equivalence of the two photometric systems at fainter magnitudes relies primarily on the reliability of the shutter timings in the various cameras used for our observations ; we fully expect these to be accurate to well under 1% .    for service as a local standard in the m4 field , suitable for use in the final transformation of all instrumental magnitudes to the adopted standard photometric system , we identified by eye stars that appeared to be relatively free from blending with neighboring stars .",
    "we further required that each star have been observed in a given filter on at least three photometric occasions , have a derived standard error of the mean magnitude in that filter @xmath17  mag , and have no evidence of intrinsic variability in excess of 0.05  mag , root - mean - square , based upon the repeatability of the available observations in all filters .",
    "these conditions were satisfied by 634 , 875 , 878 , 308 , and 877 stars in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "( for comparison , our usual stricter selection criteria  specifically , at least _ five _ independent observations on photometric occasions and standard errors @xmath18  mag in at least _ two _ filters , as well as repeatability better than 0.05  mag , r.m.s.were satisfied by 251 , 856 , 860 , 298 , and 857 of these stars , respectively . )",
    "these stars were then used as a local reference for the photometric calibration of all optical measurements of stars in m4 from the final allframe reduction .",
    "this analysis resulted in 64,626 stars in the m4 field with calibrated photometry in @xmath11 _ and _ at least one of @xmath10 or @xmath13 ; 62,943 stars had calibrated photometry in all three of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath13 ; and 18,218 of them had calibrated photometry in all five of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "since any given ccd image spans only a fraction of the total field covered by all our observations , no star appears in every image .",
    "in fact , the _ maximum _ number of calibrated magnitude measurements for any given star was 12 in @xmath9 ; 1,110 in @xmath10 ; 1,510 in @xmath11 ; 1,817 in @xmath12 ; and 42 in @xmath13 . considering only stars with at least one observation in a given filter , the median number of observations was 4 in @xmath9 , 21 in @xmath10 , 31 in @xmath11 , 1770 in @xmath12 , and 14 in @xmath13 . since most observations were centered near the cluster , member stars preferentially have more than the median number of observations ; stars in the outer part of the field where smaller numbers of observations had been made were more likely to be field stars .",
    "indeed , for the stars that we considered to be variable candidates in the study below , the median number of observations was 9 in @xmath9 , 1,106 in @xmath10 , 1,495 in @xmath11 , 1,813 in @xmath12 , and 30 in @xmath13 .",
    "an additional 36,207 stars were included in the allframe reductions , but they fell outside the area where adequate observations exist to define local photometric standards ; for these stars , astrometric information is available , but no calibrated photometry is possible at present .",
    "the infrared photometry for m4 consisted of 55 datasets from 18 observing runs , as outlined in table  [ tab : table_obs_ir ] . as with the optical data ,",
    "all photometric measurements were carried out by pbs using the daophot / allstar / allframe suite of programs .",
    "calibration of the data was slightly different from the optical case , in that we are able to use the point - source catalog of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , which provides calibrated _ jhk _",
    "photometry for stars in virtually all our images .",
    "this gives us the option of applying the `` non - photometric '' calibration approach described in the previous section to obtain fundamentally calibrated magnitudes on a well - defined system , without the need to consider extinction corrections among observations obtained at various airmasses .    for our purposes we selected only those published 2mass magnitudes that were flagged as of photometric quality `` a , '' implying an estimated standard error of the adopted magnitude @xmath19 .",
    "a total of 11,919 2mass stars having a quality `` a '' magnitude in at least one of the three filters could be identified with entries in our own catalog of stars in the target field within a one - arsecond match - up tolerance , after modest astrometric transformations had reduced the r.m.s .",
    "astrometric differences from 028 in the ra direction and 021 in the dec direction to 019 in each coordinate .    with these stars",
    "initially adopted as photometric standards , robust fitting techniques ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were used to estimate photometric transformations from the instrumental system of each of our infrared datasets to the photometric system of the 2mass catalog .",
    "the transformations involved linear color transformations , photometric zero points , and linear zero - point gradients in @xmath20 and @xmath21 across the face of each detector :    @xmath22    etc .",
    "average values of @xmath23 were computed for each detector chip and each observing run , and a separate value of @xmath24 was obtained for each digital image .",
    "there were two exceptions to this approach .",
    "first , run  1 ( designated `` m4ir '' in table  [ tab : table_obs_ir ] ) seemed to be of such good quality that we adopted the full photometric - night reduction scheme , including explicit extinction corrections and field - to - field photometric tie - in .",
    "this helped to ensure a uniform photometric calibration among the different images , which were individually rather small and contained relatively few 2mass stars apiece .",
    "second , the images obtained with mad  the multi - conjugate adaptive - optics demonstrator on the vlt @xcite  were so deep , so small , and so close to the cluster center that they contained no unsaturated images of high - quality 2mass stars . in order to calibrate these data , we used our measurements of fainter stars contained within the other datasets , calibrated to the 2mass system , to serve as local secondary standards for the mad data .",
    "after an initial calibration was found for all of the datasets excepting `` mad3 , '' the transformations were applied to our instrumental magnitudes for the 2mass standards , weighted averages were taken , and the results compared to the 2mass magnitudes for the same stars .",
    "those showing the largest residuals were rejected from consideration as local standards , and new photometric transformations were derived from all the datasets employing the more restricted set of local 2mass standards .",
    "this was repeated until all stars showing residuals larger than 0.30mag in any of the three filters had been eliminated . at the end ,",
    "our photometric calibration relies on a total of 7,901 2mass stars with valid measurements in @xmath25 ; 5,847 in @xmath26 ; and 3,389 in @xmath27 . computed values of the zero - point gradients ( @xmath28 ) ranged between extreme values of 0.151 and + 0.048@xmath1mag per 1000 pixels , and the standard deviation among all the chips and runs was about 0.015@xmath1mag per 1000 pixels .",
    "the local 2mass standards permitted us to measure these gradients with a typical precision of 0.002@xmath1mag per 1000 pixels .",
    "the color - transformation coefficients @xmath29 took on values ranging from 0.122 to + 0.225 , depending upon filter and camera , with a standard deviation among the chips / runs of about 0.16 ; the 2mass stars determined these coefficients with a typical precision of 0.008@xmath1mag / mag .",
    "the median precision for the adopted zero - point , @xmath24 , of an individual exposure was 0.008@xmath1mag .    the root - mean - square residual between the published 2mass magnitudes and",
    "our averaged calibrated photometry for the same stars is measured to be 0.063 , 0.064 , and 0.069@xmath1mag per star in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "we take these as upper limits for the statistical reliability of our average magnitude for any given star in any given filter , since uncertainties in the 2mass magnitudes as well as our own contribute to the observed scatter , and the 2mass sample includes stars whose 2mass standard errors are estimated to be as large as 0.11@xmath1mag . dividing these r.m.s .",
    "residuals by the square root of @xmath30 suggests that the formal standard error in transforming our instrumental magnitudes to the 2mass system should be @xmath31 in the mean , but surely this is unrealistic : unknown systematics could be considerably larger than this .",
    "for instance , we are not in a position to judge whether there may be zone errors in the 2mass point source catalog , such that this particular patch of sky including the globular cluster m4 may be on a slightly different photometric system than other parts of the sky in the same catalog .",
    "as mentioned above , the mad data were calibrated using a secondary set of local standards that we ourselves have selected and referred to the 2mass system .",
    "we defined 90 of these local standards , and there were a total of 11,844 individual magnitude measurements for these 90 stars among the 152 mad images .",
    "these had observed standard errors of 0.073@xmath1mag per measurement , or 0.021@xmath1mag , r.m.s .",
    ", per star , between the average of the mad magnitudes and the average of our magnitudes for the same stars from the other runs .",
    "our optical photometry has several advantages when compared with the various sets of time - series data available in the literature .",
    "( a )  in the present case , the number of consecutive observations on any given single night could be as large as 125 in any one filter , and up to 270 observations in all filters .",
    "this means that we have , for a significant fraction of objects , a number of measurements in some filters on consecutive nights that ranges from several tens to several hundred .",
    "( b )  the photometric data span a large time interval ( 16 years ) .",
    "this allows for very accurate period determinations and the opportunity to identify variables with periods close to 0.5 days .",
    "( c )  the phase coverage is quite good in at least three photometric bands , namely @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this also means that we can use three different colors and brightness amplitudes to constrain the stars pulsation properties ( see  [ chapt_position ] ) .",
    "( d )  our photometry of at least some of the known rr  lyrae variables can be supplemented with photoelectric photometry avialable in the literature @xcite . this will allow us to further constrain their pulsation properties ( blazhko effect , amplitude modulation ) , and gives us a chance , at least , to look for evolutionary effects ( period changes ) .",
    "we carried out independent identification of candidate variable stars using the welch & stetson index ( ws , @xcite ) as applied to our optical data set . in particular , we considered all stars with a weight ( defined as the number of consecutive image pairs , plus one - half the number of unpaired singleton images in which the star appears ) greater than @xmath32 we designated as candidates stars having a ws index larger than 0.8 ; 242 stars met this criterion , representing 0.9% of all stars with @xmath33 . a number of the variable stars listed in clement s catalog failed to meet these criteria : v43 had no data at all , falling outside the field spanned by our images ; stars v3 , v29 , v32 , v33 , v34 , v42 , v75 , v76 , and v79 had insufficient weight , falling in the less - well - observed outer parts of the cluster ; and v17 , v44 , v45 , v46 , v47 , v48 , v50 , v51 , v53 , v54 , v55 , v56 , v57 , v58 , v59 , v60 , v65 , v71 , v78 and v80 had ws indices @xmath34 .",
    "we added these stars to the list of candidate variables by hand , so that our software would extract their light - curve data .",
    "we will discuss these stars individually now .",
    "christine clement s on - line catalog ( `` updated 2009s '' ) lists 79 stars in m4 identified as variable ( they are numbered v1 through v80 , but v62 is identified as equal to v55 ) . of these 79 stars , 67 are listed with equatorial coordinates having a precision of 1  or better ; nine have @xmath35 coordinates with a precision of 01 ; and three have references to finding charts only , with no positions given .    for the 67 clement stars with equatorial coordinates",
    ", we transformed her positions to @xmath35 in our coordinate system , and cross - matched with our photometric catalog for m4 without regard to whether our stars appeared variable . with simple translations in @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", we were able to match 66 of the 67 stars within a tolerance of 2 , with offsets of 02 and 05 in @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and a star - to - star dispersion of 05 in each coordinate .",
    "four - constant and six - constant linear transformations did not improve the agreement .",
    "the star that could not be matched to any star in our photometry catalog was clement s v43 ; her published position for this star falls outside the area covered by our images .",
    "of the 66 matching stars , 58 of the matches were unique : no other star in our catalog was present within 2  of clement s positions ( as transformed to our reference frame ) .",
    "in each of the other eight cases , there were two stars in our catalog within 2  of the clement position : v21 , v40 , v65 , v69 , v70 , v72 , v73 , and v78 . among these , v21 was not ambiguous : the star closer to the predicted position had the right apparent magnitude and color to be an rr  lyrae and had strong evidence of variability in our data ; the other star was 2.8  mag fainter and showed no evidence of intrinsic variation . in the case of v40 ,",
    "both matches had roughly suitable magnitudes and colors , and both showed strong evidence of variability ; we retain both stars , identifying the closer and brighter match with clement s v40 and designating the fainter and more distant one new variable candidate c1 . among the other six cases ,",
    "there were only two where one star of the pair showed evidence of variability .",
    "for v69 ( this star is also identified as k50 ) , a @xmath36=@xmath117.3 star 19 from the predicted position showed strong evidence of variability while a @xmath36=@xmath116.7 star 04 from the predicted position did not . in the case of v73",
    "( this star is also identified as k54 ) , a @xmath36=@xmath117.8 star 18 from the predicted position showed mild evidence of variability while a @xmath36=@xmath119.9 star 06 from the position did not .",
    "for these two cases , we have provisionally identified clement s star with the one in our data that showed evidence of variation despite the fact that it was farther from the predicted position than the alternative .    in the final four cases ( v65 , v70 , v72 , and v78 ) , neither star appeared to be variable in our data .",
    "however , for v65 , v70 , and v78 we were able to make an unambiguous match by comparing our measured mean magnitudes for these stars to those given in clement s table .",
    "v72 is the lone remaining star .",
    "clement gives @xmath37 for this star , with an amplitude in @xmath10 of 0.3 mag .",
    "our two stars within 2  of the predicted position have @xmath38 and 18.42 . but 201 from the predicted position there does lie a star with @xmath39 and strong evidence of variability .",
    "accordingly we adopt this star as the match .",
    "alerted by this , we checked the apparent magnitudes of the other , seemingly unambigous matches , and found that v67 (= k48 ) , v68 (= k49 ) , v71 (= k52 ) , and v73 (= k54 ) had probably been misidentified ; in each case another star more than 20 but less than 25 from the predicted position appeared to be a better photometric match , and accordingly these changes were made .",
    "the star v17 turned out to be a special case .",
    "clement gives equatorial coordinates for this star , and there was exactly one star in our sample within 20 of this position ; in fact , after the modest astrometric transformation that we have applied , our star is 031 from the position recorded by clement .",
    "however , clement gives the mean @xmath10-band magnitude of v17 as 13.55 , while our star has @xmath40 and a  color of 1.30 , which is much too red for an rr  lyrae .",
    "furthermore , clement says that the period of this star is 0.8555 days  which is unusually long for an rr  lyrae  while our star shows no evidence of variability .",
    "however , we note that at the reported position of clement s star v52 we do find an rr  lyrae with a period of 0.8555 days (  4.3 below ) . according to clement , v17 has equatorial coordinates 16233402 2631078 while she gives the position of v52 as 16232408 2630276 , suggesting that at some point a transcription error changed the right ascension of v52 by 10 seconds of time , possibly creating a fictitious v17 .",
    "we further note that according to clement the coordinates of variable v18 are 16233469 2631039 , which might possibly account for the recorded declination of v17 assuming that someone made a slip of one line in reading a table .",
    "this attempted reconstruction of history is purely conjectural .",
    "all that we can state with certainty is ( a )  at clement s recorded position for v17which she attributes to a 2009 private communication from samus  we find no rr  lyrae at all , let alone an rr  lyrae with the unusual period of 0.8555@xmath1d ; ( b )  at clement s recorded position for v52 there is an rr  lyrae with the period of 0.8555@xmath1d ( she lists 0.4605@xmath1d as the period of v52 , while we find _ no _ rr  lyrae in m4 with a period between 0.455 and 0.463@xmath1d ) . for our purposes here , we drop clement s v17 from the list of candidate variable stars in m4 and retain the designation v52 , but we revise the star s period from 0.4605 to 0.8555@xmath1d .",
    "the nine stars v53 through v61 have only @xmath35 positions ( referred to the nominal cluster center ) in the clement catalog .",
    "these are all supposed to be fairly luminous stars , so it was easy to plot their predicted positions on our stacked image of the cluster field and identify the closest bright star to each position .",
    "quantitatively , the match required position offsets of 17 in each coordinate ; the nine stars then matched nine bright stars in our catalog with a root - mean - square dispersion @xmath4101 .",

    "the southeastern star has strong evidence of intrinsic variability in our data ; we identify this as v79 .    according to clement ,",
    "v76 is equal to star zb14 , identified by @xmath35 position and finding chart in @xcite .",

    "there is a plate in the paper , plate 2 , whose caption does not mention zb14 in characters that we are able to read , but there is only one star marked in this plate .",
    "we have indentified this same star in our data , and find that it has quite strong evidence of intrinsic variability on a timescale appropriate for an rr lyrae variable , although the number of our measurements of this star is comparatively small .",
    "furthermore , the measurements that we do have for this star imply a magnitude and colors appropriate for an rr lyrae at the cluster distance . on the working hypothesis that this is yao s star zb14 , we provisionally identify it as v76 .",

    "the mode identification of the rr  lyrae stars in the field of m4 was based on the so - called bailey diagram , i.e. , the plot of brightness amplitude versus period ( fig .",

    "the two labeled solid curves in the right side of the diagram represent the mean loci of fu variables of oosterhoff classes i and ii , as defined by @xcite .",
    "the candidate blazkho rr  lyraes ( black crosses ) are all pulsating in the fu mode and they cover the entire period range of fu pulsators .",
    "the fraction of blazhko stars is roughly 40% ( 13 out of 31 ) , but recent space and ground measurements indicate that the fraction of rr  lyraes showing the blazhko phenomenon is more typically of the order of 50% @xcite .",
    "the vertical bars attached to the blazhko crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : bailey ] represent the modulation of the amplitude according to our photometry .",
    "they are preliminary estimates , since we have not performed a detailed analysis of the secondary modulation ; better time series data than we presently have would be more suitable for that purpose .",
    "however , our data do indicate that the blazhko amplitude generally decreases when moving from the hot to the cool edge of the fundamental - mode instability strip .",
    "in addition , we see a half dozen fu variables that , at fixed period , have larger brightness amplitudes ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) than the other rr  lyraes ( i.e. , placing them above / to the right of the ooi locus in the figure ) , including two of the blazkho stars . this suggests a possible systematic difference between these stars and the bulk of the variables .",
    "we will find in the next section that a group of variables showing similar properties is also present in m5 .",
    "variable v52 is characterized by very low amplitudes and a period ( p=0.8555@xmath1d ) significantly longer than the other low - amplitude fu pulsators .",
    "it is located close to the red edge of the instability strip ( = 1.33 mag ) , and appears to be 0.20 mag brighter in @xmath11 than the other rr  lyraes with similar colors .",
    "this all suggests that v52 is well evolved from the zero - age horizontal branch .",
    "in general , the fo pulsators have periods shorter than 0.4 days and amplitudes showing the typical bell @xcite  also sometimes called hairpin @xcite  distribution represented by the solid curve in the left side of the bailey diagram .",

    "the new candidate member variable has a position in this diagram that is consistent with the previously known candidates .",
    "three of the fo pulsators , including the new one , have very short periods and small amplitudes , suggesting that they are located close to the blue edge of the first overtone instability strip .",

    "this diagnostic serves a double purpose : objects that show clear discrepancies in these ratios are likely to be either ( a )  other types of variable or ( b )  blended with other stars .",
    "for instance , theoretical pulsation models and empirical data indicate that the optical amplitude ratios of fu and fo cepheids should be similar @xcite , but the same is not true for rr  lyraes @xcite .",
    "the data plotted in the top panel of fig .  [ fig : amplitude_ratio_veryg_opt_final ] show that the ratio between the @xmath10- and @xmath11-band amplitudes in m4 maintains a quite stable value over the entire period range of the fu and fo variables .",
    "a similar result is found for the @xmath10- to @xmath12-band amplitude ratios ( bottom panel ) , but here the spread is slightly larger ( 0.06 or 3.8% versus 0.03 or 2.3% ) .",
    "the lack of clear outliers is additional evidence of the `` clean '' nature of the rr  lyrae sample in m4 .",
    "moreover , a comparison of the mean amplitude ratios in m4 with similar ratios for seven other galactic globulars collected by @xcite shows very good agreement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_amplratio_cluster ] ) , within the errors , for both fo ( blue squares ) and fu ( red squares ) pulsators .",

    "accurate iron abundances based on high - resolution spectra give similar results for the two clusters : [ fe / h]=1.17@xmath40.05 ( estimated systematic uncertainty ) for m4 and 1.34@xmath40.06 for m5 @xcite .",
    "note that the mean iron abundance of m4 has been solidly confirmed by @xcite on the basis of medium - resolution spectra for @xmath582,800 stars collected with flames / giraffe at vlt .",

    "the available accurate spectroscopic measurements also indicate similar @xmath62-element abundances in m4 and m5 @xcite .",
    "moreover , m5 is also affected by very low reddening ( e()=0.03 , harris 1996 ) and essentially no differential reddening , increasing its value as a reference standard .",
    "it should also be noted that precise spectroscopic analysis has suggested that there are some differences in detail between the heavy - element mixes of the two clusters .",
    "for instance , @xcite state , among other conclusions , ``  , ( 2 )  the elements from ca to ni have indistinguishable compositions in m4 and m5 , ( 3 )  si , cu , zn , and all @xmath63-process elements are approximately 0.3@xmath1dex overabundant in m4 relative to m5 , and ( 4 )  the @xmath64-process elements sm , eu , gd , and th are slightly overabundant in m5 relative to m4 . ''",
    "however , the astrophysical significance of these minor differences  what they mean for the physical state of the environment in which the clusters formed , and how they have affected the evolutionary processes that occurred in the individual stars of the two clusters  are not fully understood . for our immediate purposes , it is sufficient that all the available evidence indicates that the overall abundances of elements heavier than helium , the theoreticians @xmath55 , are the same for the two clusters within well under a factor of 2 ( 0.3@xmath1dex ) .    to quantify the comparison of the pulsation properties of the rr  lyraes in m4 and in m5 , we considered two observables that are by their nature unaffected by reddening and extinction : the periods and brightness amplitudes of the variables .",
    "[ fig : period_final ] shows that the period - frequency distributions in the two clusters are quite similar .",
    "the two samples differ in size by slightly more than a factor of two ( 45 versus 102 ) , but within the counting statistics they show very similar period distributions .",
    "in particular , each displays two well separated peaks : one for fo pulsators , at p@xmath580.3@xmath1d , and one for fu , at p@xmath580.5@xmath1d .",
    "more quantitatively , we find that the fu pulsators in the two clusters have identical mean periods ( 0.55@xmath1d ) .",
    "the same conclusion comes from the rr  lyrae population ratios , i.e. , the ratio of the number of fos to the total number of rr  lyraes : we find that ( rrc):(rrab+rrc ) is 0.30 for both m4 and m5 .",
    "the bailey diagram for m5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bailey_m5_szeidl2011_final ] ) , which is inherently reddening- and extinction - independent on both its axes , is also qualitatively very similar to that of m4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bailey ] above ) .    to further quantify the comparison between the helium - burning phases of stars in m4 and m5",
    ", we decided to extend the comparison to the entire horizontal branch .",
    "we adopted the hb parameter introduced by @xcite : @xmath65= ( b - r)/(b+v+r ) , where roman b , v and r indicate the number of hb stars bluer than the rr  lyrae stars , the number of rr  lyraes and the number of hb stars redder than the rr  lyraes ( not to be confused with italic @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which represent photometric bandpasses ) .",
    "recent estimates of @xmath66 for both m4 and m5 ( castellani et  al .",

    "this indicates that red giant branch stars in the two clusters must have experienced very similar mass loss rates . on the other hand ,",
    "the hb morphology of the oosterhoff - intermediate cluster , is significantly bluer ( @xmath65=0.87 ) , suggesting that the mass loss rate in this slightly more metal - poor cluster ( [ fe / h]@xmath671.6 ) was more efficient than in m4 and m5 .",
    "these findings suggest that the simultaneous comparison of observed rr  lyrae period distributions and hb morphologies can provide new constraints for theories of the late stages of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "particularly and importantly , we can begin to consider whether the so - called second - parameter problem and the oosterhoff dichotomy might be two sides of the same coin @xcite .    in this context it is worth recalling once again that galactic globular clusters hosting sizable samples of rr  lyraes can be divided into two groups according to the pulsation properties of the variables : oosterhoff type i ( ooi ) clusters are characterized by mean fu periods < p>@xmath680.55@xmath1d , and population ratios ( rrc):(rrab+rrc)@xmath680.17 , while the oosterhoff type ii ( ooii ) clusters have longer mean periods , < p>@xmath680.65 , and larger fo populations , ( rrc):(rrab+rrc)@xmath680.44 . according to this classification both m4 and m5 appear to be ooi clusters on the basis of the mean period and ooi - intermediate on the basis of the pulsation - mode population ratio .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that the brightness amplitudes plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : bailey ] and [ fig : bailey_m5_szeidl2011_final ] support the interpretation that both m4 and m5 are ooi clusters .",

    "we still lack an analytical relation for fo pulsators in ooi gcs due to their much smaller numbers , but the systematic offset of the rrc variables in both m4 and m5 from the ooii locus suggests , once again , a non - ooii nature for the rr  lyraes in both clusters .    during the last few years , evidence has mounted that ggcs for which the census of rr  lyrae stars is either complete or approaching completeness display this `` neutral oo status '' @xcite if the bailey diagram , the period distributions , and the population ratios are all taken into account @xcite .",

    "<S> we have also discovered two new probable rr  lyrae variables in the m4 field : one of them by its position on the sky and its photometric properties is a probable member of the cluster , and the second is a probable background ( bulge ? ) object . </S>",
    "<S> we provide accurate equatorial coordinates for all 47 stars identified as rr lyraes , new photometric measurements for 46 of them , and new period estimates for 45 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also derived accurate positions and mean photometry for 34 more stars previously identified as variable stars of other types , and for an additional five non - rr lyrae variable stars identified for the first time here . </S>",
    "<S> we present optical and near - infrared color - magnitude diagrams for the cluster and show the locations of the variable stars in them . </S>",
    "<S> we present the bailey ( period - amplitude ) diagrams and the period - frequency histogram for the rr lyrae stars in m4 and compare them to the corresponding diagrams for m5 ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the rr  lyrae populations in the two clusters are quite similar in all the relevant properties that we have considered . </S>",
    "<S> the mean periods , pulsation - mode ratios , and bailey diagrams of these two clusters show support for the recently proposed `` oosterhoff - neutral '' classification . </S>"
