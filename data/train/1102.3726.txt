    "<S> the full quantum dynamics of a spinon under external magnetic fields is investigated by using the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) method within the microcanonical picture of transport . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the center of the spinon oscillates back and forth in the absence of dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum many - body behavior can be understood in a single - particle picture of transport and bloch oscillations , where quantum fluctuations induce finite life times . </S>",
    "<S> transport , oscillations and lifetimes can be tuned to some degree separately by external fields . </S>",
    "<S> other nontrivial dynamics such as resonance as well as chaos have also been discussed .    controlling the time - evolution of quantum states and manipulating the dynamics of quantum matter </S>",
    "<S> have attracted considerable theoretical and experimental attention in recent years due to their relevance to fundamental physics as well as potential applications in information storage , encoding and processing . up to now , most efforts in this field are based on solid state systems . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the progress in ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices not only provides an ideal platform for simulating quantum many - body models in condensed matter physics , but also paves the way for quantum manipulation . due to the unique properties of the ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices , such as the extremely low dissipation rates and long coherence times </S>",
    "<S> , we can explore the dynamics of quantum many - body systems in a clean and dissipation - less environment . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to manipulate the quantum many - body state with an unprecedented degree of precision , and study new physical effects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an early breakthrough in the field was the first direct observation of bloch oscillations ( bo ) in a tilted optical lattice@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in solid state systems , scattering by impurities would result in strong damping of bloch oscillations , while in an optical lattice the perfect optical crystals are free from any imperfections , and what is more , the long coherence times and high tunability of optical lattices not only enable us to observe bo directly , but also to manipulate the dynamics of the quantum particles via external fields .    </S>",
    "<S> compared with the dynamics of the quantum particles , it may be more interesting to explore and manipulate the quasi - particles , which emerge as elementary excitations in quantum systems consisting of a collection of interacting particles , and may behave differently compared to the original particles . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting example of this is known as fractionalization : the particles are effectively split into smaller constituent quasi - particles , which only carry a fraction of quantum numbers .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the quantum dynamics of one of the most known quasi - particles : the spinon , which is an excitation separating two degenerate states of opposite magnetization in a quantum spin chain and usually carries a fractionalized quantum number ( spin-@xmath0 ) . using the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) </S>",
    "<S> method@xcite within the microcanonical picture of transport  @xcite , we study the time evolution from a quantum many - body initial state with a spinon , and show how to manipulate its dynamics via external fields . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that this quantum many - body problem can be interpreted in the picture of a quantum quasiparticle at the single - particle level , which shows controllable linear transport and ( bloch ) oscillation behavior depending on perpendicular external fields , where the field along the magnetization direction controls the bloch oscillation physics and the transverse field controls the linear velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening of the quasiparticle is also tunable by the field strength . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a quantum resonance behavior of the spinon under a periodically driven external field . this may pave the way to the controlled manipulation of quasiparticles , also in view of potential applications in condensed matter and ultracold atom physics .    </S>",
    "<S> our hamiltonian is a finite 1d transverse ising model with an additional magnetic field along the @xmath1-direction : @xmath2 with a ferromagnetic coupling @xmath3 , pauli matrices @xmath4 on sites @xmath5 , and a transverse field along the @xmath6-direction that breaks magnetization conservation . without the magnetic field @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , the transverse ising model can be solved exactly by a jordan - wigner transformation and is known as a classic paradigm of a quantum phase transition@xcite .     and ( a ) @xmath8 , ( b ) @xmath9.,width=321 ]    recently , the transverse ising model has been realized experimentally in cobalt niobate and a @xmath10 symmetry has been observed in the vicinity of the quantum critical point of this model@xcite . in the presence of a magnetic field along the @xmath1-direction @xmath11 , eq.([onsite ] ) can no longer be solved exactly by jordan - wigner transformation , because it would induce a nonlocal term . in this paper , @xmath11 is a constant or a time - dependent field , and in both case , it will lead to nontrivial dynamics of the spinon .     at different times ( black squares : @xmath12 ; red dots : @xmath13 ; green upward triangles : @xmath14 ; blue downward triangles : @xmath15 ) for @xmath16 , @xmath9 . </S>",

    "<S> to realize this initial state , we can choose its wavefunction as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the normalization constant and @xmath22 denotes a perfect static spinon located between site @xmath5 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the length of the lattice . if we choose @xmath26 , the initial state is a perfect bloch wave function with definite wave vector @xmath27 , and the spinon is totally delocalized over the length of the lattice . to ensure that the spinon is initially located at the center of the lattice , we then choose a gaussian @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> given the exponentially fast decay of @xmath29 away from the center of the lattice , we can just keep @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and make all other @xmath33 for constructing the initial wave function . in our calculation </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore choose @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we also define the average position of the spinon @xmath35 as the position where @xmath36 .     and different @xmath17.,width=264 ]    as certain excitations can be modeled as quasiparticles , i.e. , having similar properties to real particles , we may conjecture that this is the case here and compare the spinon to a real particle , where the field coupling to @xmath37 lead to the motion of the particle and where the field coupling to @xmath38 acts as a constant electric field along the axis in the particle picture , as the zeeman energy induced by @xmath39 is proportional to the displacement of the spinon from its original position . to verify this picture quantitatively , </S>",
    "<S> we use tebd within the microcanonical picture of transport to calculate the time evolution of the spinon from our initial state @xmath40 which is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> in the course of the real time evolution we use the length of our lattice @xmath41 and take the truncation dimension @xmath42 and time step @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence is checked by taking larger @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> times are measured in inverse hopping strengths @xmath45 throughout the paper .     and different @xmath11 ; ( b ) the linear relation between the frequency of bo and @xmath11.,width=264 ]    </S>",
    "<S> first we focus on the case @xmath16 ; the real - time evolution from our initial state @xmath40 for different parameters @xmath17 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ com ] : ( a ) @xmath8 ; ( b ) @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spinon propagates along the @xmath47-direction with a velocity proportional to @xmath17 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ data1 ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the linear relation between the velocity and @xmath17 has been numerically verified in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ data1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum fluctuations increase the width of the spinon during the time evolution , giving a lifetime to the quasiparticle . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum fluctuations make the quantum spinon different from its classical counterpart : the magnetic domain wall , which corresponds to a soliton solution of the nonlinear landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) that can preserve its shape during the propagation . </S>",
    "<S> below we will see that all these results are modified when we introduce the magnetic field along the @xmath1-direction .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we apply a constant magnetic field @xmath11 along the @xmath1-direction . by interpreting the dynamics of the spinon in terms of a real particle in a constant external field </S>",
    "<S> suggests the observation of bloch oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> first we fix @xmath9 and investigate the dependence of the spinon dynamics on @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> . the time evolution of the spinon under different magnetic fields @xmath11 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dww](a ) @xmath18 ; ( b ) @xmath19 . for bloch oscillations ( bo ) </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the bo is only dependent on the strength of the external constant field , which can also be verified via our numerical result , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ data2 ] , where we fix @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we can find that for different @xmath17 , the period of the bo is the same ( @xmath48 ) , while the amplitude of bo @xmath49 is determined by @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> if we fix @xmath9 , the time evolution of the spinon for different @xmath11 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ data3](a ) . following the interpretation in terms of a bloch oscillation </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that the oscillation frequency to be proportional to the strength of the external field @xmath11 , which can be verified numerically ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ data3](b ) ) .     of the spinon for @xmath8 and ( a ) @xmath50 ; ( b ) @xmath19.,width=283 ]    next , we study the time evolution of width of the spinon . the width of the spinon @xmath51 can be defined similarly to the definition of the width of a wavepacket . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce @xmath52 and @xmath53 , , where @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ width ] . without the magnetic field along the @xmath1-direction , @xmath16 , we observe ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ width ] ( a ) ) that the width oscillates strongly at first whereas after some relaxation time , it grows linearly in time , which means the spinon would become wider and wider in the process of propagation of the spinon . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different for @xmath55 , as shown in fig.[width ] ( b ) , where after some short - time behavior the width of the spinon oscillates around an average value instead of diverging , which corresponds to a solitonic breather mode : not only is the position of the spinon confined to oscillate around the center of the lattice by the magnetic field , but its width oscillates as well around an average value .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 ( solid line ) and @xmath56 .,width=302 ]    the dynamics of the spinon is even more interesting when the system is driven by a time - dependent magnetic field @xmath57 . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> we choose a periodic driving magnetic field : @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> classically , it is known that if the frequency of the driving force can match the intrinsic frequency of the system , the system can accumulate vibrational energy and even a small periodic driving force can produce large amplitude oscillations , in another words , a resonance occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon can also be observed in our quantum system , where the intrinsic frequency corresponds to the frequency of bloch oscillations of the spinon . as shown in fig.[res ] , the amplitude of the oscillation of spinon is drastically enhanced when the frequency of the driving potential is comparable to @xmath59 , the frequency of bo corresponding to @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> highly nontrivial dynamics may emerge when the frequencies of the external driving force and the bloch oscillation become incommensurate , which could induce chaotic dynamics of the spinon .    </S>",
    "<S> now we discuss several possible trapped ultracold atoms systems that could realize our hamiltonian ( [ onsite ] ) experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> likely candidates are rydberg atoms @xcite , which have been already used in quantum simulations and manipulation and have attracted lot of attention in recent years @xcite . albeit highly excited </S>",
    "<S> , the lifetime of rydberg atoms can reach even hundreds of microseconds , which is much longer than the typical lifetime of the first excited state of alkali metal atoms . </S>",
    "<S> two possible states of a rydberg atom ( excited state and ground state ) on each site reduce the problem to that of a pseudo - spin system , and the strongly dipole - dipole interactions contribute to the interaction between the pseudo - spins ( @xmath61 ) , and the external magnetic fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be realized by a laser with single atom rabi frequency @xmath64 and detuning @xmath51 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the dipole - dipole interaction drops off as @xmath65 , meaning that the next - nearest neighbor interaction will still be appreciable , however it is much weaker than the nn neighbor interactions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we do not expect that this changes the physics qualitatively for a ferromagnetic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative way would be provided by ultracold dipolar atoms or molecules with two internal states in optical lattices in the hardcore limit , with an externally driven intra - species transition ( @xmath17-field ) and a zeeman term@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experimental progress in observing ultracold atoms at the single atom level ( or even single spin level)@xcite would be helpful to detect the dynamics of the single quasi - particles ( spinons ) . </S>",
    "<S> the classic counterpart , a magnetic domain wall , has been realized experimentally as a super cold atom thermometer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering the rapid development of the field , we expect hamiltonian ( [ onsite ] ) and the nontrivial spinon dynamics proposed in this paper should be accessible experimentally in various setups soon .    our results could also be illuminating for condensed matter physics , especially for the domain wall motion in magnetic nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> classically , the magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems is governed by llg equation@xcite , where the spin is considered as a classic vector and its dynamics is reduced to a classic nonlinear equation . however , with advances in the miniaturization of magnetic structures one has to anticipate that the classical and phenomenological llg equation will eventually be inadequate , necessitating a full microscopic quantum description of the magnetization dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our result actually paves the way to study the motion of the domain wall in the quantum situation . while dissipation would be very weak in a quantum optical implementation of our model </S>",
    "<S> , it would be more relevant in a solid . for the classic domain wall </S>",
    "<S> , the dissipation is known to play a key role in determining its velocity@xcite . under the assumption of a memory - free bath </S>",
    "<S> , dissipation could be modeled in the framework of a lindblad quantum master equation or a stochastic schrodinger equation  @xcite ; the numerical method used here can be extended to simulate this model , both in an matrix product operator ( mpo)@xcite or quantum jump approach @xcite . depending on the detailed nature of the physical realization ( and hence the bath ) , </S>",
    "<S> much richer physics could emerge due to the interplay between interactions and dissipation making it an interesting topic for future studies . </S>"
