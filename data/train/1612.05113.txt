    "@xmath19 @xmath20 it is easy to check that for the case of @xmath21 the positive cone is actually a cone in geometric sense . a topology on @xmath7 is said to be _ compatible _ with order structure if @xmath22 is closed .",
    "we can also identify a partial order structure with @xmath23 * negative cone * of @xmath7 . for a detailed treatment of these see @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we will consider partial orders in @xmath0 corresponding to negative cones @xmath24 generated by a set of fixed basis vectors @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 . this partial order is compatible with standard topology of @xmath0 . +",
    "in the case of @xmath27 we will use independent vectors @xmath28 as a generating set for the negative cone . in this case the boundary of the negative cone is a broken line which is the building block of our construction of inversion formula for broken - line radon transform .",
    "+      now a natural question is in what sense of differentiation we can generalize fundamental theorem of calculus to @xmath0 ?",
    "one can also relate this problem to local change of the coordinate system , but we will do our specific construction in a general setting using order structure on @xmath0 and its geometric properties . + for @xmath29 we define @xmath6 on @xmath0 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the standard lebesgue measure on @xmath0 and @xmath32 represents the negative cone at @xmath33 with respect to partial order on @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "the integral is taken over the region @xmath34 .",
    "now , by looking at the following figure you can see the negative cone corresponding to @xmath33 which appears in the formula : +     [ fig : xsd ]    we will rely on the following theorem ( which is a generalization of fundamental theorem of calculus ) . let @xmath35 be the euclidean ball with radius @xmath36 centered at @xmath33 then we have the following    [ lsbg ] ( lebesgue differentiation theorem , see @xcite and @xcite ) let @xmath37 be integrable . then the following is true almost everywhere : @xmath38 where @xmath31 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath0 .",

    "note that because of the fact that we can push the limit inside the integral for continuous @xmath3 the order of taking limits makes no difference . in the case of arbitrary @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath69 the same argument will work after applying a change of variable .",
    "one can see that this is also true even if we increase the dimension .",

    "we define a pre - measure @xmath89 on the ring of subsets generated by these parallelograms using @xmath90    using a natural relation to absolute continuity on the real line we define absolute continuity of @xmath6 as follows :    [ abscon ] let @xmath6 be a function on @xmath0 with a given order structure of @xmath0 .",
