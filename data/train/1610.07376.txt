    "the inverse scattering problem consists on finding the shape and the location of an obstacle by measuring the scattered wave , close or far from the scatterer . depending on the kind of illumination ( acoustic , electromagnetic or elastic ) and the properties of the obstacle ( soft , hard , penetrable or not ) one faces different kind of problems regarding the unique solvability of the problem and the numerical scheme for approximating the solution .    in this work",
    "we place the obstacle in a two - dimensional homogeneous and isotropic elastic medium and we assume that it is penetrable , a so - called inclusion , with different lam parameters from the exterior domain .",
    "we consider as incident wave an elastic longitudinal or transversal wave that after interacting with the boundary of the medium is split into an interior ( transmitted ) and a scattered wave , propagating in the inclusion and the exterior , respectively .",
    "the scattered wave is also decomposed into a longitudinal and a transversal wave with different wavenumbers that behave like spherical waves with different polarizations at infinity .    before considering the inverse problem",
    ", we should have a good knowledge of the direct problem , which is to find the scattered field and its far - field patterns from the knowledge of the obstacle and the incident wave .",
    "the direct problem is linear and well posed for smooth obstacles @xcite .",
    "the inverse problem that we consider here can be seen as a continuation of @xcite where the inverse problem was examined for a rigid scatterer and a cavity .",
    "the problem of detecting an elastic inclusion has been also considered for given boundary measurements @xcite , using the factorization method @xcite , the linear sampling method @xcite , a gradient descent method @xcite or the probing method @xcite .    here , we solve this inverse problem by formulating an equivalent system of non - linear integral equations that has to be solved with a regularization iterative scheme due to its ill - posedness . to avoid an inverse crime we consider the direct method ( betti s formula ) for the inverse problem",
    "and we keep the indirect approach as proposed in @xcite for the direct problem .",
    "this method was introduced in @xcite and then applied in many different problems , see for instance @xcite for some recent applications .",
    "the system consists of four equations , two on the unknown boundary taking advantage of the boundary conditions and two on the unit circle assuming that we know the far - field pattern of the scattered fields for one or more incident waves .",
    "even though the first two equations are well - posed because of the equivalence to the system of integral equations for the direct problem , the last two inherit the ill - posedness of the system due to the smoothness of the far - field operators .",
    "following @xcite we apply a two - step method meaning , we first solve the well - posed subsystem to obtain the corresponding densities and then we solve the linearized ( with respect to the boundary ) ill - posed subsystem to update the initial approximation of the radial function .",
    "we consider tikhonov regularization and the normal equations are solved by the conjugate gradient method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in we formulate the problem in two dimensions and in we present the direct scattering problem , the elastic potential and the equivalent system of integral equations .",
    "the inverse problem is stated in where we construct an equivalent system of integral equation using the direct method . in the two - step method for the parametrized form of the system and the necessary frchet derivatives of the operators",

    "the reconstructions for @xmath256 coefficients , two incident fields and @xmath257 initial radius are presented in after 40 iterations for the exact data and 25 iterations for the noisy . in ,",
    "we see that the reconstructions are not highly dependent on the initial guess .    in the second example ,",
    "the boundary to be reconstructed is the apple - shaped . here",
    ", we set @xmath258 and @xmath259 the reconstructions for exact data and different number of incident fields are presented in for 18 iterations ( one incident direction ) and 40 iterations ( three incident directions ) .",
    "shows the effect of the initial guess for noisy data and 40 iterations .    in the last example",
    ", we choose the kite - shaped boundary .",
    "we consider @xmath260 coefficients and @xmath261 in we see the improvement with respect to the number of incident fields for exact data , 10 iterations for three illuminations and 40 iterations for four illuminations .",
    "the dependence on the initial guess is shown in , for @xmath262 we needed 40 iterations and 25 for @xmath263 , in doth cases we considered noisy data .",
    "all examples show the feasibility of the proposed method that is also reasonably stable against noise .",
    "the results are considerably improved if we consider more that one incident wave .",
    "one could also considered more sophisticated regularization techniques and methods to compute the regularization parameter that could improve the reconstructions but are out of the scope of this paper ."
