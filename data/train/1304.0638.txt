    "among various quantum many - particle phenomena in condensed matter physics the kondo effect @xcite stands out as a unique fundamental state exhibiting remarkable properties both in bulk systems @xcite and in a quantum dot ( qd ) setup @xcite .    in qds @xcite the kondo effect appears when a qd is switched into the coulomb blockade regime by tuning the gate voltage .",
    "normally the qd states with even and odd numbers of electrons ( coulomb valleys ) result in a zero bias minimum of the differential conductance as a function of the bias voltage",
    ". however , when the temperature @xmath0 is lowered this situation changes qualitatively : the qd states with even numbers of electrons still result in a zero bias minimum of the differential conductance while for the qd states with odd numbers one observes an anomalous behavior where the differential conductance at zero bias shows a maximum often referred to as the kondo resonance .",
    "this so - called zero bias anomaly is a manifestation of the unpaired spin inherent to the qd states with odd numbers of electrons .",
    "another important property of the kondo effect is that together with its appearance the zero bias anomaly acquires universality : the differential conductance of different qds collapses into a single function of the temperature and voltage .",
    "it depends on specific qd parameters only through the energy scale @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the kondo temperature .",
    "the kondo effect has different universal character at low and high energies . at low energies , smaller than @xmath1",
    ", one observes the fermi - liquid behavior ( strong coupling limit ) , a quadratic universal dependence of the differential conductance on the temperature , voltage , or external magnetic field . in the opposite regime of high energies ,",
    "larger than @xmath1 , the differential conductance is characterized by a logarithmic universal dependence ( weak coupling limit ) . at intermediate energies",
    "it shows a universal crossover between these two limits .",
    "the zero bias anomaly and its universality have been observed in equilibrium @xcite and nonequilibrium @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium kondo universality in the deep crossover is characterized by a universal value of the differential conductance at the kondo voltage , @xmath3 .",
    "theory predicts @xcite that this universal value is equal to @xmath4 of the maximum value which the differential conductance takes in equilibrium at zero temperature .",
    "this provides an efficient way to nonequilibrium experimental measurements of the kondo temperature @xcite .",
    "interplay between the kondo state and other quantum collective phenomena such as ferromagnetism @xcite , superconductivity @xcite or the kondo state in an external magnetic field @xcite currently represent a very active research field both in theory and experiment .",
    "the kondo effect in a qd placed in an external magnetic field is of particular interest .",
    "the magnetic field couples to the spins of the electrons in the qd and produces the zeeman splitting of the single - particle qd energy level .",
    "it is known @xcite that such a magnetic field destroys the zero bias anomaly , that is , it restores the normal behavior where the qd states with odd numbers of electrons at low voltages result in minima of the differential conductance , similar to the qd states with even occupancies .    however , it turns out that the magnetic field does not destroy the universality .",
    "theory @xcite and experiment @xcite demonstrate that even when there appears a minimum in the differential conductance at @xmath5 , it still remains universal both in equilibrium ( as a function of @xmath0 at @xmath5 ) and nonequilibrium ( as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "important nonequilibrium issues which have been addressed in experiments @xcite on the kondo effect in an external magnetic field are 1 ) kondo universality ; 2 ) the critical magnetic field at which the zero bias maximum of the differential conductance starts to split into two maxima ; 3 ) the distance between these maxima as a function of the magnetic field ; 4 ) the high - field limit of this distance .",
    "the issues above have obviously a highly nonequilibrium nature .",
    "the nonequilibrium theory of the kondo effect in the _ whole _ energy range is a complicated problem even without a magnetic field .",
    "the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method @xcite , which is known to be a numerically exact tool in equilibrium , is difficult to generalize to nonequilibrium @xcite . to cover the whole energy range in nonequilibrium one has to resort to other methods",
    "these are the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) ( intermediate and large energies ) @xcite , equations of motion ( mainly qualitative tool ) @xcite , mean - field theories ( low energies ) @xcite , or @xmath7 expansions ( low energies ) @xcite . in the whole energy range",
    "the real - time renormalization group method @xcite is a powerful tool .",
    "it has been developed for the @xmath8 model @xcite and can account for the zeeman splitting in the weak coupling regime @xcite . to our knowledge , however , a generalization to include the zeeman splitting in the strong coupling regime has not been done yet .",
    "another theoretical tool is the keldysh effective field theory @xcite developed for the anderson model @xcite . in its first application it has been shown that this theory well captures the weak coupling limit @xcite and is capable to cope with finite , though large interaction strengths @xcite .",
    "recently it has been further developed to describe the behavior of the differential conductance in the whole range of temperatures and bias voltages @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we address the behavior of the kondo state in an external magnetic field both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium . to this end",
    "we extend the keldysh effective field theory @xcite to account for the zeeman splitting of the single - particle qd energy level and derive an approximate analytical expression for the qd tunneling density of states ( tdos ) .",
    "the theory is then applied to calculate the universal differential conductance as a function of the temperature , bias voltage and magnetic field in the whole energy range . at this point",
    "we would like to note that while there are other theories able to address the kondo effect , they are only applicable to specific regimes of the kondo state .",
    "in particular , the perturbative renormalization group @xcite is applicable in the weak coupling ( or logarithmic ) regime , renormalized perturbation theory @xcite or interpolative perturbative approximation @xcite are applicable in the strong coupling ( or fermi - liquid ) regime , and nca @xcite is applicable and very successful in the weak coupling regime and also in the intermediate coupling regime ( several orders below @xmath2 ) .",
    "this shows that a single theory able to describe all the regimes of the kondo state is highly desirable . in the present work",
    "we make a step to develop such a single theory and demonstrate that despite the approximations made in the theoretical derivation our theory has a number of advantages : 1 ) fermi - liquid behavior when the zeeman energy is much less than @xmath1 ( advantage over nca @xcite ) ; 2 ) logarithmic behavior when the zeeman energy is much larger than @xmath1 ( advantage over mean - field theories @xcite ) ; 3 ) critical magnetic field close to results of previous theories @xcite and experiments @xcite ; 4 ) distance between the maxima of the differential conductance as a function of the magnetic field in a good agreement with experiments @xcite and absence of a spurious zero bias peak at a finite magnetic field ( advantage over nca @xcite ) ; 5 ) high - field limit of this distance in a good agreement with experiments @xcite ; 6 ) universality with the correct scaling given by @xmath2 .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ tm ]",
    "we present our model of a strongly correlated qd in a magnetic field . here",
    "we also show the slave - bosonic transformation used in our work . the analytical expression for the qd tdos resulting from an effective keldysh field theory is given in section [ kfis ] . here",
    "we analytically investigate the low - energy sector of the theory proving its fermi - liquid nature and providing the fermi - liquid coefficients for the temperature , voltage and magnetic field behaviors as well as their universal ratios .",
    "additionally , when the zeeman energy is much larger than @xmath1 we analytically derive the logarithmic asymptotics of the differential conductance as a function of the magnetic field at @xmath9 and @xmath5 . in section",
    "[ results ] , integrating the analytical expression for the qd tdos , we calculate the universal behavior of the differential conductance in the whole range of temperatures , voltages and magnetic fields . here",
    "we show all the regimes of the kondo state : the strong coupling limit , weak coupling limit and the crossover region .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section [ conclusion ] where all the advantages and drawbacks of our theory are summarized and a systematic way to improve the theory is mentioned .",
    "to describe the strongly interacting qd we employ the single - impurity anderson model @xcite ( siam ) .",
    "this model describes a system of two interacting electrons .",
    "the strength of the electron - electron interaction is given by the parameter @xmath10 . in the absence of the interaction",
    "the electrons can occupy a spin degenerate single - particle energy level @xmath11 .",
    "we include the effect of an external magnetic field through the zeeman splitting @xmath12 of this energy level , @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath17-factor , @xmath18 is the bohr magneton and @xmath19 is the magnetic field .",
    "the qd hamiltonian is thus of the following form : @xmath20 where the number operator @xmath21 is given in terms of the original anderson fermionic operators as @xmath22    in addition to the interacting electronic system described by the siam , we also consider a noninteracting electronic system which models the contacts , that is an external system used to probe the qd .",
    "we consider two contacts and the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the set of orbital quantum numbers in the contacts , @xmath25 is the contact spin degree of freedom and @xmath26 denotes the left and right contacts .",
    "here we also assume that the electronic states in the left and right contacts are characterized by the same complete set of quantum numbers , @xmath27 .",
    "the left and right contacts are in equilibrium states specified by the chemical potentials @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the electrons can tunnel between the qd and contacts .",
    "these tunneling events are described in terms of the tunneling hamiltonian , @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the tunneling matrix elements and we assume that these matrix elements are diagonal in the spin space and that they do not depend on @xmath32 , that is , they are the same for the left and right contacts ( qd symmetrically coupled to the contacts ) .    in equilibrium",
    "the chemical potentials of the qd and contacts are equal to each other .",
    "we denote this equilibrium value as @xmath33 and define the applied bias voltage @xmath6 as @xmath34 .    as mentioned in the introduction , the kondo effect , or the zero bias anomaly , develops at low temperatures out of the coulomb blockade regime when the qd is blockaded with an odd number of electrons . within the siam",
    "this means that the kondo resonance takes place when the qd has one electron .",
    "this is achieved when the electron - electron interaction @xmath35 exceeds the energy @xmath36 ( see below ) resulting from the qd - contacts coupling .",
    "to describe the relevant physics and at the same time to simplify the formalism , we consider the case of of the strongly interacting qd where @xmath37 . in this case",
    "the double occupancy is forbidden and the qd may have zero or one electron . at the same time",
    "the difference @xmath38 is assumed to be finite but much larger than @xmath36 so that the number of electrons in the qd is close to one .",
    "note that this asymmetric anderson model @xcite differs from the symmetric one where one first assumes @xmath39 and only after that takes the limit @xmath37 which , as a result , leads to @xmath40 .",
    "this model admits the so - called slave - bosonic representation @xcite .",
    "it represents a transformation where the original qd fermionic operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 are mapped onto new fermionic operators @xmath43 , @xmath44 and bosonic ( often called slave - bosonic ) operators @xmath45 , @xmath46 by means of the following relations : @xmath47=1,\\,[b , b]=0 . } \\label{sb_transform}\\ ] ] additionally , the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 commute with the operators @xmath45 , @xmath46 .    physically the transformation ( [ sb_transform ] ) means that instead of using the states of the electrons in the qd one uses the states of the qd itself : the empty state ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) and the state with one electron ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "since the empty state and the state with one electron represent all the states of the qd , one arrives to the constraint , @xmath48 which physically means that the total number of the new fermions and slave - bosons is restricted to be equal to one .",
    "after the slave - bosonic transformation the qd and tunneling hamiltonians take the form @xcite : @xmath49 @xmath50    the total hamiltonian of this , in general nonequilibrium , problem is the sum of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 given by eqs .",
    "( [ qd_ham_sb ] ) , ( [ c_ham ] ) and ( [ t_ham_sb ] ) , respectively .",
    "this hamiltonian together with the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ sb_constraint ] ) represent the theoretical model able to describe the essential behavior of the zero bias anomaly arising due to the kondo effect in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "as it is well known , the kondo effect is an essentially nonperturbative phenomenon @xcite .",
    "therefore , to cover all the regimes of the kondo state one must resort to nonperturbative methods able to deal with both electron - electron interactions and nonequilibrium .    in particular , the real - time formalism developed by keldysh @xcite represents a general and powerful method to treat interacting many - particle systems both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium . originally",
    "this method was developed in the diagrammatic framework .",
    "its field integral form has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the interplay between disorder and electron - electron interactions in metals .",
    "the advantage of the field integral form is that it reduces the problem to an analysis of a functional , the so - called keldysh effective action .",
    "this analysis has a more systematic nonperturbative character than the diagrammatic selection on the basis of the topological structure reflecting the physical content of a given diagram .",
    "in addition to being systematic , this nonperturbative approach turns out to be very general and applicable also to mesoscopic and qd systems .",
    "it has been applied , _",
    "e.g. _ , to describe the coulomb blockade in qds @xcite as well as the kondo effect in the strong coupling limit @xcite , weak coupling limit @xcite and in the whole energy range @xcite .",
    "in particular , the slave - bosonic formulation presented in the previous section has been used in the keldysh effective action framework in refs .",
    "@xcite . the advantage of these slave - bosonic theories over slave - boson mean - field theories @xcite and @xmath7 expansions @xcite is that they take into account the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ sb_constraint ] ) exactly while slave - boson mean - field theories and @xmath7 expansions account for this constraint only approximately .",
    "because of this approximation one can only access the low energy ( smaller than @xmath1 ) physics of the kondo state , that is the fermi - liquid regime , or strong coupling limit , characterized by the quadratic dependence of the qd differential conductance .",
    "the main drawback of this approximation is that it does not lead to logarithmic terms @xcite in the differential conductance and thus one can not access intermediate ( of order of @xmath1 ) and high energy ( larger than @xmath1 ) physics , that is , the crossover region and weak coupling limit of the kondo state , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the slave - bosonic keldysh effective action theories in refs .",
    "@xcite account for the constraint in eq .",

    "as one expects , in the kondo regime @xmath139 turns out to be a universal function of @xmath140 ( or @xmath141 , where @xmath120 is defined as @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) .",
    "let us now address the nonequilibrium kondo physics in the presence of an external magnetic field . in fig .",
    "[ figure_3 ] we show the zero temperature differential conductance as a function of the bias voltage at different magnetic fields .",
    "again all the curves are universal with the scaling given by the kondo temperature , which means that eqs .",
    "( [ tdos_result ] ) and ( [ rtrd_se ] ) provide the differential conductance with the correct scaling also in nonequilibrium and finite magnetic fields . from fig .",
    "[ figure_3 ] one observes that when the magnetic field is increased , the zero bias kondo peak first decreases and then splits into two peaks .",
    "our theory predicts that for the asymmetric siam , considered in the present work , the zero bias peak starts to split at the critical magnetic field @xmath137 which is close to other theoretical results @xcite , @xmath144 ,     the universal differential conductance as a function of the bias voltage at finite temperatures and magnetic field @xmath145 .",
    "the parameters are the same as for fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] .",
    "the increase in temperature leads to two effects : 1 ) the height of the peaks reduces ; 2 ) the width of the peaks increases ( broadening).,width=9 ]    @xmath146 obtained , however , for the symmetric siam .",
    "it is interesting to note that an equilibrium estimate @xcite predicts @xmath147 for the case of the symmetric siam .",
    "this shows that the aspect of the critical magnetic field requires a proper nonequilibrium treatment .",
    "for example , a qualitative treatment of this aspect with the help of the equation of motion method @xcite significantly overestimates the critical magnetic field and predicts @xmath148 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure_3 ] shows the distance @xmath138 between the two peaks as a function of the magnetic field . at low magnetic fields",
    "@xmath138 has a rapid increase and then saturates at @xmath149 .",
    "this high field limit of our theory is in a good agreement with equilibrium @xcite and nonequilibrium @xcite theoretical results which predict that in the kondo regime at high magnetic fields @xmath138 saturates at a value close to two zeeman splittings , @xmath150 .",
    "moreover , in the kondo regime ( that is at not too large magnetic fields so that the charge excitations are not involved in the transport ) the differential conductance obtained in ref .",

    "[ figure_3 ] , our nonequilibrium theory is also in a good agreement with experiments in ref .",
    "in contrast , the equilibrium theories in refs . @xcite both predict a saturation at much larger fields than observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the same time ,",
    "similar to our nonequilibrium theory , a nonequilibrium extension of nrg @xcite predicts for the symmetric siam with finite @xmath35 a faster increase of @xmath138 as a function of the magnetic field ( see figs . 3b and 3c in ref .",

    "[ figure_4 ] we show the differential conductance as a function of the bias voltage at finite temperatures and at the magnetic field value @xmath152 .",
    "also in this case the differential conductance is a universal function with correct scaling given by the kondo temperature .",
    "as one expects , when the temperature increases the two peaks in the differential conductance are lowered and broadened .",
    "in conclusion , we have applied the keldysh effective action theory to study the kondo effect in qds in an external magnetic field both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium . to this end",
    "we have generalized the keldysh effective action theory from ref .",
    "@xcite to take into account the effect of the magnetic field through the zeeman splitting .",
    "an approximate analytical expression for the qd tdos has been obtained .",
    "we have used this qd tdos to calculate the differential conductance in the whole energy range and demonstrated that the theory has a number of advantages : 1 ) fermi - liquid behavior when the zeeman energy is much less than @xmath1 ( advantage over nca @xcite ) ; 2 ) logarithmic behavior when the zeeman energy is much large than @xmath1 ( advantage over mean - field theories @xcite ) ; 3 ) critical magnetic field close to results of previous theories @xcite and experiments @xcite ; 4 ) distance between the maxima of the differential conductance as a function of the magnetic field in a good agreement with experiments @xcite and absence of a spurious zero bias peak at a finite magnetic field ( advantage over nca @xcite ) ; 5 ) high - field limit of this distance in a good agreement with experiments @xcite ; 6 ) universality with the correct scaling given by @xmath2 .    at the same time , due to the second order expansion of eq .",
    "( [ f_tdos ] ) , the theory does not take into account all inelastic cotunneling processes which are of the fourth order in the tunneling matrix elements .",
    "therefore , the present theory underestimates the differential conductance at voltages such that @xmath153 ( see fig . [ figure_3 ] ) .",
    "an additional consequence of this approximation is that at high magnetic fields the differential conductance as a function of the bias voltage is oversensitive with respect to the temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_4 ] ) .",
    "these drawbacks can be eliminated by taking into account higher order terms in eq .",
