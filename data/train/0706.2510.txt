    "the overdamped equation of motion of a classical particle in one dimension presents a simple yet very useful model for the study of many physical , biological , economical , and other systems . depending on the character of the force field acting on the particle , this equation provides a basis for describing different phenomena in these systems .",
    "specifically , if the force field contains the noise terms arising from the influence of the environment , it describes a large variety of noise - induced phenomena including noise - induced transitions @xcite , directed transport @xcite , and stochastic resonance @xcite , to name only a few .",
    "it should be noted that in some cases , especially within the white - noise approximation , the statistical properties of the solution of this equation can be obtained analytically .",
    "if the environment is disordered the force field contains also the random functions of the spatial variable . in this case",
    "the overdamped dynamics represents both the noise - induced and disorder - induced effects and it can exhibit as well anomalous behavior even in the simplest situation of additive white noise @xcite . for the latter situation",
    "a number of exact results was obtained for sinai disorder @xcite , gaussian disorder @xcite , and also for some special cases of non - gaussian disorder @xcite .",
    "when the noise terms produced by a stochastic environment become negligible , the overdamped equation of motion accounts solely for effects of quenched disorder .",
    "this equation effectively describes , e.g. , the transport of particles in deterministic ratchets with quenched disorder @xcite and can be used for the study of the dynamics of localized structures like domain walls in random magnets and vortices in type - ii superconductors .",
    "although temporal noise terms are absent , there are only very few exact results available .",
    "therefore , in order to fill this gap , we have examined the following dimensionless equation of motion for an overdamped particle @xcite : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 denotes the particle coordinate that satisfies the initial condition @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a constant force , and @xmath4 is a dichotomous random force generated by a piecewise linear random potential @xmath5 , see fig .",
    "it is assumed that the random intervals @xmath6 of a linearly varying @xmath5 are statistically independent and distributed with the same ( exponential ) probability density @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the conditions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are imposed .    equation ( [ eq motion ] ) is of minimal form that accounts for the effects of quenched disorder on the overdamped motion of driven particles .",
    "its main advantage is that many of the statistical properties of @xmath1 can be described analytically in full detail .",
    "nevertheless , if the odd and even intervals @xmath6 are distributed with different exponential densities ( in this case the exact results exist as well ) , then eq .  ( 1.1 ) can be used also for studying a number of important physical issues .",
    "specifically , this equation constitutes a basis for describing the adiabatic transport of particles in randomly perturbed one - dimensional channels and presents a simple model for studying the low - temperature dynamics of charge carriers and localized structures in randomly layered media .",
    "in addition to the listed examples , we point out at rather unexpected application of eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) in astrophysics .",
    "namely , if the clouds in interstellar space are distributed uniformly then the distances between them are distributed with an exponential distribution . in this case , assuming that the light velocity in the clouds is the same and the sizes of clouds are distributed with an exponential distribution , eq .  ( 1.1 ) can be used for studying the statistical properties of distances that pass the light emitted by a star in different directions .",
    "in @xcite we derived the probability density of the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq motion ] ) and investigated explicitly its time evolution .",
    "in contrast , in this work we focus on the statistical properties of the arrival time for the particles governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq motion ] ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the path integral representation for the probability density of the arrival time .",
    "the characteristic function of the arrival time is determined in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the moments of the arrival time and study their asymptotic and scaling behavior .",
    "the basic properties of the arrival time probability density are studied in sec .",
    "v , both analytically and numerically .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec  vi .",
    "some technical details of our calculations are deferred to the appendix .",
    "according to eq .  ( [ eq motion ] ) , the arrival time @xmath10 , i.e. , the time that a particle spends moving from the origin to a position @xmath11 , is given by the integral expression @xmath12 this time depends on the random function @xmath13 and thus presents a random quantity .",
    "the probability density @xmath14 that @xmath15 for a fixed coordinate @xmath16 , i.e. , the probability density of the arrival time , is defined in the well - known way as @xmath17 where the angular brackets denote an averaging over the sample paths of @xmath13 , and @xmath18 is the dirac @xmath19 function .    to obtain the explicit form of @xmath14 we use a path integral approach . because of the dichotomous character of the random function @xmath13 , it is convenient to present the probability density in terms of the partial densities @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the probability density that for the sample paths of @xmath13 which are undergoing @xmath22 changes of the sign on the interval @xmath23 the condition @xmath15 holds . for a given @xmath24 the solution of eq .",

    "@xcite ) , the limiting probability density approaches a gaussian form , i.e. , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 as @xmath174 .",

    "the probability density is then presented as the histogram of arrival times of the particle . for further details about this procedure",
    "we refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite where a similar approach was used for the numerical evaluation of the probability density of the particle position at a fixed time @xmath142 . in doing so",
