    "several years ago a new expansion for the riemann zeta function has been found by the author @xcite , @xcite:@xmath3where@xmath4and@xmath5is the pochhammer symbol ( having such an unfortunate denotation and sometimes called the rising factorial ) .",
    "pochhammer symbols are in fact polynomials in variable @xmath6 with integer coefficients equal to the stirling numbers of the first kind . since @xmath7 tend to zero fast enough as @xmath8 expansion ( [ zeta ] ) converges uniformly on the whole complex plane .",
    "in fact , there exists a whole class of expansions similar to ( [ zeta ] ) .",
    "the crucial thing is to remove the single pole of @xmath9 in @xmath10 which may be achieved either by multiplication by @xmath11 ( or by any other function having single simple zero at unity ) or by subtraction of @xmath12 ( or by any other function having single simple pole at unity ) . in the second case",
    "we get a series converging even faster:@xmath13where@xmath14    one has also the freedom of choosing the `` node '' points at which expressions ( [ zeta ] ) or ( [ zeta1 ] ) give exact values , however the choice of even positive integers seems most natural , since @xmath7 may be expressed by bernoulli numbers and appropriate powers of @xmath15 avoiding values such as @xmath16 .",
    "finally , on can go all the way writing @xmath17 \\label{zeta2}\\]]with @xmath18and@xmath19where @xmath20 is also regular on the whole complex plane .",
    "one can check that expansion ( [ zeta2 ] ) gives exact values @xmath21 as well as @xmath22 irrespective of how many terms in the series is taken into account .    in 2003 luis bez - duarte , investigating expansion ( [ zeta ] ) , found an interesting criterion for the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) @xcite .",
    "the crucial thing is to estimate the asymptotic behavior of certain real numbers defined as@xmath23more precisely , rh is equivalent to the statement that@xmath24if @xmath25then all zeros of @xmath26 are simple whereas regardless of the validity of the rh ( unconditionally)@xmath27as bez - duarte pointed out , criteria of this type , i.e. relating rh to values of zeta at integer points , were known for a long time , however this one is definitely simpler and well - fitted for numerical investigations .",
    "such investigations were performed numerically by the author in 2003 leading to the observation ( which was surprising for us at that time ) that the global behavior of coefficients @xmath28 may be split into a trend ( which dominates for low @xmath1 not exceeding roughly @xmath29 ) and subtle oscillations superimposed on this trend .",
    "( similar splitting has been found by the author in the case of li criterion for the rh , however in this case the oscillations are much more chaotic @xcite . )",
    "of course , such behavior may be well understood in the theory of binomial transforms using rice s integrals ( already known by nrlund ) .",
    "sums of this type can be interpreted as high order differences of appropriate numerical sequences @xmath30 .",
    "they were carefully investigated @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the main result is ( cf .",
    "theorem 2 in @xcite):@xmath31   \\label{theorem}\\ ] ]    the proof of this fundamental theorem consists in applying classic cauchy residue formula .    in the case of ( [ ck ] )  we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which is analytic on @xmath34 and meromorphic on the whole complex plane @xmath35 , therefore it fulfils the assumptions of the above theorem .",
    "it is clear that the problem is to find all poles of suitable function , in our case @xmath36 .",
    "these poles are due to simple zeros of zeta in @xmath37 as well as due to complex zeros which we write as @xmath38 .",
    "( obviously if rh were true then all @xmath39s would be real . )",
    "it is a matter of elementary exercise to find that for @xmath40 the residues in real poles are:@xmath41where the last equality is a consequence of the functional equation for the zeta function .    using main theorem ( [ theorem ] ) and ( [ trivialres ] )",
    "we find that the asymptotic form of the trend which stems from trivial zeros is@xmath42(the latter being numerically still more effective ) whereas the oscillating part due to complex zeros in the critical strip is:@xmath43where @xmath44 is the euler beta function and @xmath45 . both ( [ ctrend ] ) and ( [ osc ] ) converge quickly , hence they are suitable for numerical estimations contrary to the direct approach using the main definition ( [ ck ] ) which becomes very time - consuming as @xmath1 grows .",
    "what s more , values of zeta function at positive even integers should be calculated with many significant digits .",
    "since @xmath46 tends quickly to unity as @xmath47 grows it is advisable , when using ( [ ck ] ) , to tabulate appropriate number of high - precision values of @xmath48 to preserve sufficient amount of significant digits as well as to avoid repeated unnecessary calculations .",
    "nevertheless , calculating of the single coefficient @xmath49 took about 2 weeks on a fast cluster of four computers @xcite . on the other hand , formulas ( [ ctrend ] ) and ( [ osc ] )",
    "are much more effective : obtaining @xmath50 is a matter of few tens of seconds on a modest machine . in numerical calculations using ( [ osc ] ) the function ` nresidue ` implemented in _ mathematica _ proved especially useful",
    ". figures 15 and the table below present the results .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the residues in ( [ osc ] ) may be expressed by complex zeros of @xmath26 in a manifest way .",
    "introduce function @xmath51 as usual@xmath52since @xmath53 may be factorized using hadamard product@xmath54(the product being taken over paired complex zeros @xmath55 ) one can see that the residue of @xmath56 in each particular pole @xmath55 may be expressed as a function of all remaining @xmath55s .",
    "let us label consecutive complex zeros as @xmath57 according to the increase of @xmath58 .",
    "choose further a particular zero @xmath59 and introduce certain `` crippled '' function @xmath60 as@xmath61@xmath62 is obviously regular at @xmath63 and@xmath64where asterisk denotes complex conjugation and@xmath65which is regular at @xmath55 .",
    "formula ( [ res ] ) is not very useful in practice since the product over paired complex zeros converges slowly , nevertheless , when combined with ( [ osc ] ) , gives an explicit formula relating any @xmath66 to complex zeros @xmath55 .    using different approach bez - duarte gave another version of explicit formula of this kind , cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem 1.5 .",
    "the present approach is based entirely on nrlund - rice s integral and provides , i believe , immediate and more natural interpretation for the existence of oscillatory component of the coefficients @xmath28 which is completely hidden in their primary definition ( [ ck ] ) .",
    "after all , the behavior of this very component is crucial for the rh , see fig .",
    "5 . last not least , resulting formulas are more handy and more effective in numerical calculations .",
    "having any criterion for the rh the key thing is to say how `` useful '' it may be in numerical experiments .",
    "for example , li s criterion states that rh is true if certain numbers @xmath67 are positive @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath47 initial @xmath67 are positive implies that roughly only @xmath68 complex zeros lay on the critical line oesterle . since high @xmath67 are extremely difficult to compute we can honestly say that li s criterion , although very elegant , is pretty useless in practice . the natural question arises now",
    ": does the fact that @xmath1 initial @xmath28 obeys ( [ criterion ] ) implies that certain number @xmath69 of initial complex zeros lay on the critical line ?",
    "what is the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath69 ?",
    "below we present simple argument based on formulas derived in this paper .    the consecutive residues ( [ res ] ) seem to be bounded sequence of complex numbers , cf .",
    "6 , so we neglect their influence .",
    "using euler beta function expansion for large values of its first argument @xcite @xmath70 , \\quad \\left\\vert a\\right\\vert \\rightarrow \\infty   \\label{asympt}\\ ] ]    we get:@xmath71   \\label{asympt2}\\end{gathered}\\]]it is clear that if @xmath39 is real then we get bounded oscillations in @xmath72 and , in the view of  ( [ criterion ] ) , rh is satisfied .",
    "suppose , however , that there exists somewhere defiant extremely high zero @xmath73 with @xmath39 having non - vanishing imaginary part .",
    "( more precisely , there should be four such zeros at once placed symmetrically with respect to the critical axis and the real axis . )",
    "we are now sure that such a zero , if any , lies higher than @xmath74 @xcite , @xcite and probably higher than @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this non - vanishing imaginary part would cause the trigonometric functions in ( [ asympt2 ] ) to acquire , roughly speaking , growing amplitudes thus violating criterion ( [ criterion ] ) .",
    "now , the amplitude of such growing oscillations would be extremely small due to elementary properties of the euler beta function which appears in ( osc ) . specifically , for @xmath76 @xmath77 ( which is not much higher than the range acquired recently by odlyzko ) the amplitude due to the corresponding zero is roughly @xmath78 .",
    "of course , the task to extract this particular harmonic , let alone to check whether its amplitude grows , is far beyond any numerical capabilities . in other words , even if the relatively low complex zero of zeta , say the hundredth , had some small shift off the critical line we would not be capable of finding this using ( [ criterion ] ) since its amplitude , in the sense of ( [ asympt2 ] ) , is about @xmath79 times smaller than the amplitude of the first zero .",
    "this is rather sad news for all those who wish to ( dis)prove the celebrated rh using simple criteria . on the other hand , estimations like that",
    "presented above enable one to understand why this problem is so tough .",
    "the holy grail and immortality it would bring to persistent searcher remain still out of reach ... well , perhaps there exists even simpler explanation to this mystery , explanation not involving all that terrible mathematics .",

    "paul s _ epistle to the romans _",
    "should nt these words be taken for a clue ? yet , for a century and a half many mathematicians would sell their souls for the proof .",
    "clearly , there is an apparent contradiction between such a deal and st .",
    "paul s words .",
    "1 . coefficients @xmath28 for @xmath1 up to @xmath29 exhibit no apparent sign of oscillations . after calculating numerically the first @xmath80 coefficients @xmath28 this looked as `` a pleasant smooth curve '' @xcite .",
    "4 . behavior of @xmath28 ( yellow ) may be split into strictly growing trend ( red ) plus the oscillating part ( blue ) here plotted in the logarithmic @xmath1-scale .",
    "initially the trend dominates over the oscillations but it tends to zero faster than these oscillations .",
    "5 . over 44 million components of @xmath28 : trend @xmath81 ( red ) and oscillating part @xmath66 ( blue ) , both multiplied by @xmath82 ( compare rh criterion ( [ criterion ] ) ) . the former grows strictly to zero whereas the latter seems to tend to perfect sine wave which is dominated by the first zero .",
