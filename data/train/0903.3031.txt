    "the launch of _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( fermi ) _ on 11  june  2008 heralded a new era for high - energy ( he ) gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "the _ large area telescope ( lat ) _ aboard _ fermi _",
    "@xcite is @xmath0 times more sensitive than its predecessor , the _ energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret)_. recently , _ fermi _ anounced the detection of the globular cluster ( gc ) 47  tucanae as a bright point source @xcite",
    ". this emission may plausibly be due to the large number of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) residing in this cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hum05 ) .",
    "gcs are furthermore possible sources of very high energy ( vhe ) gamma rays ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bs07 ) , and are / will be important targets for ground - based cherenkov telescopes such as the _ high energy stereoscopic system _ ( _ h.e.s.s . _",
    "* ) as well as future telescopes such as the _ _ cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) _ _ and the _ _ advanced gamma - ray imaging system ( agis)__.    @xcite modeled the collective curvature radiation ( cr ) expected from 47  tucanae , demonstrating that this pulsed component should be detected by _",
    "fermi _ , depending on the number of visible gamma - ray pulsars in the gc msp population , @xmath1 ( see  [ sec : intro2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite extended these results by modeling the unpulsed inverse compton ( ic ) and synchrotron radiation ( sr ) flux components expected due to the interaction of he electrons , ejected from msp magnetospheres , with the ambient cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and bright starlight photons , in the presence of a nebular magnetic field @xmath2 .    in this letter , we give updated cr spectra (  [ sec : pulsed ] , see @xcite for details ) , in addition to further ic calculations (  [ sec : unpulsed ] ) , for 47  tucanae and also terzan  5 , another gc containing many msps (  [ sec : intro2 ] ) .",
    "the roles of _ fermi , h.e.s.s .",
    "_ , and _ cta _ for deriving model constraints are discussed in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "gcs are very old galactic sub - structures , with evolved stellar composition . as a consequence ,",
    "they are likely to harbor a larger than usual density of end products of stellar evolution  compact objects .",
    "this is supported by observations of x - ray binary systems and msp populations in gcs . since the discovery of the first gc msp in m28 @xcite , a total of  140 pulsars have been discovered in  26 gcs @xcite , with 90% having periods @xmath3  ms @xcite .    among the gcs , 47",
    "tucanae and terzan  5 stand out by the number of radio - detected msps they host : 23 and 33 respectively @xcite .",
    "however , these gcs are otherwise remarkable for different reasons .",
    "47  tucanae is one of the most massive gcs , after @xmath4  centauri , while the core density of terzan  5 gives it the highest expected rate of binary interactions @xcite .",
    "basic properties for these two objects are summarized in table  [ tab : andre ] .    besides pulsed emission , detected already in radio , x - rays , and gamma rays ,",
    "msps are also expected to produce steady low - flux vhe emission .",
    "given the sensitivity of current instruments , it is likely that only a population of such objects would produce detectable vhe fluxes (  [ sec : unpulsed ] ) .",
    "the extension of the cores of the gcs is furthermore clearly below the angular resolution of current he and vhe instruments . in this letter",
    "we are therefore not concerned about individual msp fluxes , but attempt to constrain a particular class of polar cap ( pc ) pulsar models using the total flux from a gc msp ensemble .",
    "this approach reduces uncertainties in the cr and ic fluxes due to unknown pulsar geometries , as the relative uncertainties in ensemble - averaged fluxes , which scale as the reciprocal of the square root of the number of msps @xcite , are typically one order of magnitude smaller ( for @xmath5  msps ) than for the case of single msp ` geometry - averaged ' fluxes .",
    "an important issue in the context of this work is the uncertainty on the size of the msp population in each system , beyond the radio - detected ones .",
    "we dinstinguish between two numbers .",
    "we define the number of visible _ gamma - ray _ pulsars ( @xmath1 ) as those msps whose cr is ( mostly ) beamed toward earth , so that observers will in principle be able to measure pulsed emission from these ( although it might not always be possible to distinguish individual members due to experimental limitations ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath6 represents the total number of msps in the gc , whether visible in pulsed gamma rays or not .",
    "mostly off - axis pulsars might still contribute to the total cr flux , as observers may be clipping the faint edges of gamma - ray beams from these pulsars .",
    "we therefore include them in @xmath1 , along with the on - beam msps .",
    "hum05 noted that gamma - ray beams of msps are probably wider than their radio beams , so @xmath1 is probably larger when applied to gamma - ray pulsars ( as done here ) than when applied to radio ones , possibly up to @xmath7 .",
    "the ic flux however depends on @xmath6 , as _ all _ pulsars , including ones with off - beam geometries , are expected to contribute vhe leptons ( mostly electrons , as most msps are believed to be pair production starved ; see hum05 ) which upscatter soft photons to gamma - ray energies .",
    "the isolated location of 47  tucanae in the southern sky away from the galactic plane made it a prime target for gc studies . in radio , @xcite estimated from the unresolved emission a maximum of 30 detectable msps . in x - ray ,",
    "_ chandra _ observations revealed a large number of unidentified sources in the core of 47  tucanae @xcite , from which followed an upper limit of about 60 msps , based on the x - ray properties of radio - confirmed msps in the gc .    for terzan  5 ,",
    "the available observations are not so constraining . again in the radio , @xcite estimated a range of @xmath8 msps in the core of the gc , from _ very large array ( vla ) _ and _ australia telescope compact array ( atca ) _ data .",
    "no equivalent result has yet been derived in x - rays .",
    "the analysis of _ chandra _ data by @xcite yielded x - ray sources , but with too high a sensitivity limit to constrain the msp population .",
    "finally , for both systems , gc evolution models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest msp numbers below  200 , of which a fraction would be detectable .",
    "lcccc distance @xmath9 ( kpc ) & 4.0 & 1 & 5.5 @xmath10 8.7 & 2 , 3 + mass ( @xmath11 ) & @xmath12 & 4 & @xmath13 & 5 + core radius @xmath14 ( arcmin ) & 0.40 & 6 & 0.18 & 6 + half mass radius @xmath15 ( arcmin ) & 2.79 & 6 & 0.83 & 6 + detected radio msps & 23 & 7 & 33 & 7 + total stellar luminosity ( @xmath16 ) & @xmath17 & 8 & @xmath18 & 8",
    "as previously @xcite , we use an isolated pulsar pc model @xcite , including the effect of general relativistic ( gr ) frame dragging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in accordance with the expectation that most msps are inefficiently screened by cr and ic",
    "scattering pairs ( hum05 ) , we use an unscreened acceleration potential .",
    "we furthermore use the same population of msps : @xmath19-values ( period - derivatives ) from @xcite , which imply an average spin - down luminosity of @xmath20  ergs@xmath21 , as well as canonical values for equation of state ( eos ) parameters ( moment of inertia @xmath22 , stellar radius @xmath23  cm , and pulsar mass @xmath24 ) . as previously ,",
    "we add the cr spectra of @xmath25 msps , randomly selected from our population of 13 members ( each with a random pulsar geometry , i.e.  magnetic inclination and observer angle , including off - beam cases ) iteratively a million times , and so obtain an average pulsed spectrum , with 2@xmath26-bands indicating the uncertainty due to varying @xmath27 and @xmath19-values , as well as the unknown pulsar geometries .",
    "@xcite used a delta function approximation for the cr spectrum radiated per primary , but the resulting spectral shape did not correspond well to results of similar studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as pointed out by dyks ( 2008 , personal communication ) .",
    "we therefore developed a corrective technique involving the full cr spectrum per primary @xcite , and applied it here . assuming that the msps in terzan  5 have similar basic pulsar parameters than those in 47  tucanae , we scaled the cumulative cr spectrum of the latter to distances of @xmath28  kpc and 8.7  kpc .",
    "the resulting updated cr spectra for 47  tucanae and terzan  5 are shown in panels  ( a ) and  ( b ) of figure  [ fig : diff ] .",
    "we calculate the _ ejection _ spectrum of electrons leaving each msp by binning the number of primary electrons ejected per unit time according to their residual energies at the _ light cylinder_. we add the spectra of @xmath29  msps ( with random inclination angles ) and iterate the monte carlo procedure a million times . from this",
    "we obtain an average cumulative ejection particle spectrum and 2@xmath26-bands @xcite .",
    "we divide the region where unpulsed radiation is generated into two zones : @xmath30 , reaching from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , with @xmath14 the core radius , and @xmath33 , reaching from @xmath32 to @xmath34 , with @xmath15 the half mass radius ( see table  [ tab : andre ] ) . for 47  tucanae , we used energy densities of @xmath35 ev/@xmath36 for @xmath30 , and @xmath37 ev/@xmath36 for @xmath33 for the starlight component , assuming a temperature of @xmath38  k ( more details may be found in * ? ? ?",
    "these become @xmath39 ev/@xmath36 and @xmath40 ev/@xmath36 for terzan  5 ( note that the energy densities , and therefore the ic ` bumps ' associated with the upscattering of stellar photons , are linearly dependent on the assumed total stellar luminosity  see table  [ tab : andre ] ) . for the cmb component",
    ", we use @xmath41  ev/@xmath36 ( for @xmath42  k ) .",
    "we next calculate the steady - state _ injection _ electron spectrum for each zone by multiplying the cumulative ejection spectrum by an effective time - scale which incorporates both radiation losses and particle escape .",
    "we modeled the latter ( i.e.  trapping of particles by the nebular field ) assuming bohm diffusion .",
    "the injection spectra were calculated for nebular fields of @xmath43 g and @xmath44 g ( bs07 ) . using these results",
    ", we obtained the expected unpulsed ic flux for each gc ( see figure  [ fig : diff ] ) . while the lower - energy sr spectra are not discussed here , we do include sr losses in the calculation of the steady - state injection particle spectrum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we have modeled the he and vhe components of cr and ic flux expected from a population of msps in the gcs 47  tucanae and terzan  5 , for  100 members ( figure  [ fig : diff ] ) . for illustration",
    ", we assume that all msps are visible ( i.e.  @xmath45 )",
    ". however , the cr spectra are linearly dependent on @xmath1 , while the ic spectra are linearly dependent on @xmath6 .",
    "_ fermi _ has recently released a list of bright sources ( @xmath46 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including preliminary fluxes of 47  tucanae of @xmath47  @xmath48s@xmath21 and @xmath49  @xmath48s@xmath21 for energy bands spanning 100  mev  1  gev and 1  gev",
    " 100  gev respectively .",
    "our average cr spectrum is overpredicting these fluxes by factors of @xmath50 and  @xmath51 .",
    "however , the pulsed spectrum may quite reasonably be scaled to @xmath52 ( as suggested by observations ) .",
    "also , extrapolating from observed trends in single msp spectra , one may speculate that it is possible that the cut - off energy may be smaller due to uncertainties in eos parameters , the electric potential , magnetospheric structure , and pulsar geometry .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath52 , and halving all cr spectral energies ( i.e.  shifting the cr spectrum to the left by a factor of  2 ) , the model predictions improve to @xmath53 and @xmath54 times the _ fermi _ flux in these bands .    our ensemble - averaged cr spectrum , resulting from @xmath55 single msp spectra ( i.e.  @xmath56 100-member cumulative spectra ) with typical spectral cut - offs around a few gev ( generally depending on the individual msp s @xmath27 , @xmath19 , eos , and geometry ) , exhibits a broad peak around @xmath57  gev .",
    "this average spectral cut - off energy follows directly from the assumed acceleration potential and b - field geometry of the pc model under consideration , as well as the fact that we simulate a random selection from the @xmath58 parameter space for gc msps ( similar to hum05 ) , and with different geometries .",
    "given the fact that our cr spectrum seems to be reasonably successful at reproducing the preliminary _ fermi _ data , we expect that the predicted cut - off energy must be close to the real one .",
    "this implies that the average model acceleration potential must be of the right order of magnitude , assuming dipolar b - fields .",
    "a more detailed study involving further model and parameter space constraints will have to await further _ fermi _ spectral results .",
    "we indicate _ egret _ upper limits ( uls ) from @xcite on figure  1a , and from @xcite on figure  1b , converted assuming an @xmath59 spectrum .",
    "interestingly , the 100  mev ul is close to the _ fermi _ sensitivity for 47  tucanae .",
    "the _ egret _",
    "ul for terzan  5 is not very constraining , and implies @xmath60 for @xmath28  kpc , and @xmath61 for @xmath62  kpc ( using the average _ integral _ cr spectrum ) .    as a reference , we have also included a cr prediction from hum05 , scaled to @xmath25 , in figure  [ fig : diff ] .",
    "hum05 noted that the collective radiation from msps in gcs may be visible for _ fermi _ , and proceeded to apply their unscreened gr frame - dragging pc model to the msps in 47  tucanae .",
    "they estimated the cr flux above 100  mev from 47  tucanae by integrating along a single magnetospheric b - field line , normalising to a ( conservative ) solid angle of 1  sr per pc , and scaling by the standard goldreich - julian pc current .",
    "this approach , which was followed to circumvent full 3d modeling , may be regarded as yielding a theoretical upper limit , given that different pulsar geometries ( especially off - beam ones ) have not expicitly been taken into account as done here , thus significantly exceeding our results at 100  mev .",
    "predictions from bs07 focused on the possibility that he leptons , which may be accelerated inside msp magnetospheres and / or reaccelerated at colliding pulsar and stellar wind shocks , gradually diffuse through the gc and upscatter cmb and soft stellar photons to produce an unpulsed component in the gev  tev energy band .",
    "bs07 assumed that 1% of the spin - down power ( with the population average taken as @xmath63  ergs@xmath21 ) is injected in relativistic leptons . in the absence of detailed model predictions , they assumed power - law injection spectra ( typical for shock acceleration ) with various low and high - energy cut - offs and spectral indices , and normalized these using the assumed average msp spin - down power and conversion efficiency .",
    "representative resulting ic spectra , linearly scaled to our population - average spin - down luminosity of @xmath20  ergs@xmath21 , are shown in figure  [ fig : diff ] .",
    "our ic predictions , obtained by conservatively assuming no reacceleration of electrons , roughly agree with those of bs07 around a few tev , but deviate at other energies due to different injection spectra , as well as slightly different assumptions regarding the energy density of stellar photons in the gcs ( compare our two - zone approach with bs07 s energy density profile given in their figure  1 ) .",
    "constraints on @xmath6 as well as @xmath2 may be derived from our model , using the predicted ic flux and assuming non - detection above 1  tev at the level of 1% and 0.1% of the crab flux , as achievable by _ h.e.s.s . _ and _ cta",
    "_ , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : constr ] , regions of the @xmath64 parameter space could be excluded from vhe uls , e.g.  choosing @xmath65 g for 47  tucanae , the _",
    "_ ul constrains the total number of msps to @xmath66 ( and @xmath67 for _ cta _ ) .",
    "terzan  5 is less constrained ( these limits become @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath28  kpc , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 at @xmath62  kpc ) . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "particle escape is greater ( and ic flux is lower ) , so that the constraints are less severe .",
    "this is also true for large @xmath2 , where higher sr losses lead to inhibited ic flux .",
    "furthermore , taking reacceleration of vhe electrons into account would increase sr and ic fluxes , implying more stringent constraints on @xmath6 and @xmath2 in the case of a non - detection .",
    "the @xmath64 constraints are however dependent on the choice of diffusion coefficient ( a larger coefficient would result in enhanced particle escape and thus lower ic flux ) .",
    "it is thus possible to invert the argument and obtain constraints on the diffusion coefficient in the absence of reacceleration , using future vhe limits and assuming reasonable values for @xmath6 and @xmath2 . to this end , a combination of _ fermi _ data and monte carlo modeling may help constrain @xmath1 and @xmath72 , and thus @xmath6 .",
    "also , measurements of the predicted diffuse ultraviolet sr @xcite and unpulsed diffuse gamma - ray ic spectra may further constrain the lepton injection spectrum as well as @xmath2 .",
    "lastly , if @xmath2 is large enough ( @xmath73 g ) so that diffusion losses are unimportant relative to sr losses , particle reacceleration in the gc may be studied without having the concern of the latter being masked by energy - dependent diffusion .",
    "we would like to thank alice harding , dave tompson , and jarek dyks for useful discussions .",
    "this research was supported by an appointment to the nasa postdoctoral program at the goddard space flight center , administered by oak ridge associated universities through a contract with nasa , and also by the south african national research foundation and the sa centre for high performance computing .",
