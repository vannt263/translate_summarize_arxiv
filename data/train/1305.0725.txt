    "one of the popular models for stock price dynamics in mathematical finance is based on a geometric lvy process @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a lvy process started from zero and @xmath2 is the initial stock price . in this model",
    "the interest rate @xmath3 is typically constant and it is assumed that the measure @xmath4 is risk - neutral , which means that the process @xmath5 is a martingale under measure @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in calculating the price of a fixed strike asian option , which in this model would be given by [ asian_option ] c(s_0,k , t):=e^-r t .    in order to calculate @xmath6 one could use either a monte - carlo simulation approach , or a semi - analytical technique .",
    "we would like to emphasize two of these techniques , both of which have important connections with other branches of probability .",
    "the first technique is based on the observation that , while the process @xmath7 is not markovian , the process z_t:=(x+z_t)e^-x_t does satisfy markov property . the process @xmath8 is known as a _",
    "generalized ornstein - uhlenbeck _ process , and it is an important and well - studied object , see @xcite and the references therein . since @xmath9 is a markov process , after a change of measure we can rewrite the expectation in so that it involves only @xmath10 , and this can be computed by solving the backward kolmogorov equation , which in this case takes the form of a partial integro - differential equation ( one dimension for time and one for space variable ) .",
    "this approach was developed in a more general setting by vecer and xu @xcite , and it was skillfully implemented by bayraktar and xing @xcite for jump - diffusion processes .",
    "the second semi - analytical technique is based on the _ exponential functional _ of the lvy process @xmath1 , which is defined for @xmath11 as [ def_iq ] i_q:=_0^(q ) e^x_u u. here @xmath12 denotes an exponential random variable ( independent of @xmath1 ) with mean @xmath13 if @xmath14 , and @xmath15 if @xmath16 . in the latter case",
    "we need to impose an additional condition @xmath17<0 $ ] in order to ensure that the exponential functional @xmath18 is well - defined ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) ) .",
    "exponential functionals are very important and useful objects , not only in mathematical finance but also in many other areas of probability theory .",
    "they play a role in such fields as self - similar markov processes , random processes in random environment , fragmentation processes and branching processes .",
    "they are also connected with the generalized ornstein - uhlenbeck processes ( their distribution appears as a stationary measure of the process ) .",
    "see @xcite for an overview of this topic .",
    "the connection with asian options is the following : the distribution of the exponential functional can be viewed as the laplace transform in @xmath19-variable of the distribution of @xmath20 . by inverting this laplace transform one can obtain the distribution of @xmath20 and , therefore , the price of the asian option .",
    "this approach was use in @xcite for lvy processes with hyper - exponential jumps ( see also @xcite for general results on lvy processes with one - sided jumps ) , and this will be the approach that we will follow in the present paper . our goal is to identify the distribution of the exponential functional for a large family of underlying lvy processes ( having such desirable properties , as jumps of infinite activity or infinite variation ) and to apply these results to pricing asian options .    let us say a few words on the current state of knowledge of the distribution of the exponential functional .",
    "this distribution is known explicitly for processes with hyper - exponential jumps @xcite , and for a slightly more general class of processes with jumps of rational transform @xcite ( the processes in both of these families can have jumps of finite activity only ) .",
    "the distribution of the exponential functional is also known for a family of hypergeometric processes , which was introduced recently in @xcite .",
    "this family includes processes with jumps of infinite activity or infinite variation , however in this case the distribution of @xmath18 is only known for a single value of @xmath14 , which depends on the parameters of the underlying process @xmath1 . to the best of our knowledge , there are no known examples of lvy processes having double - sided jumps of infinite activity or infinite variation , for which the distribution of @xmath18 can be identified explicitly for all @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we fill this gap and we find the distribution of the exponential functional @xmath18 for a general meromorphic process .",

    "the family of meromorphic processes is quite large , in particular it is dense in the class of processes with completely - monotone lvy measure ( see @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", this family is a natural generalization of lvy processes with hyper - exponential jumps ( we will call them _ hyper - exponential processes _ from now on ) , for which the density of the lvy measure is also given by , with the two infinite series replaced by finite sums .",
    "while hyper - exponential processes can have only finite activity compound poisson jumps , meromorphic processes can exhibit a wide range of path behavior , including jumps of infinite activity or infinite variation , which makes them good candidates for modeling purposes in mathematical finance .",

    "both of these algorithms are very efficient ; the cpu time seems to be comparable with the results of cai and kou on hyper - exponential processes ( see @xcite ) .",

    "yet the results produced by both of these algorithms agree up to five decimal digits , which is a good indicator that these results are indeed correct .",
    "the algorithm based on monte - carlo computation also produces consistent results , however these estimates are much less accurate and require cpu time on the order of several minutes .    we have performed similar numerical experiments for many other values of parameters of the underlying theta - process , as well as for different maturities and different strike prices .",
    "qualitatively , the results seem to be consistent with the ones presented in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] . algorithm 2",
    "is very efficient for the parameter set i , and gives high accuracy even for relatively small values of @xmath63 .",
    "this should not be surprising , as in this case we have a theta - process with jumps of finite variation ( but infinite activity ) , and it is intuitively clear that processes with compound poisson jumps can provide a good approximation for such processes . on the other hand , parameter set ii corresponds to a theta - process with jumps of infinite variation and zero gaussian component , and here our approximation by a compound poisson process with a non - zero gaussian component",
    "is bound to be less precise .",
    "nevertheless , algorithm 2 works quite well in all cases , and , in our opinion , it may be a preferred method to compute prices of asian options for any meromorphic processes ( though testing this algorithm on other meromorphic processes , such as beta - processes @xcite , would be worthwhile ) .    algorithm 1 has comparable performance ( though it is a little slower than algorithm 2 ) .",
    "it has one potential advantage compared with algorithm 2 .",
    "imagine that we want to compute the price of the asian option for @xmath190 and then to check whether we have sufficient accuracy by doing the same computation with @xmath248 .",
    "algorithm 2 would require re - computing everything , since the laplace exponent @xmath249 of the hyper - exponential process will change , thus all the numbers @xmath103 , @xmath104 ( the solutions to equation @xmath250 ) will be different .",
    "this is not the case for algorithm 1 : here the laplace exponent @xmath100 does not depend on @xmath63 , thus the roots @xmath103 and @xmath251 with @xmath252 will not be affected .",
    "therefore , we only need to compute the new roots for @xmath253 , which will need fewer computations . the same idea can be applied for the evaluation of the mellin transform , where the results for @xmath190 in can be stored in memory , and only the remaining finite product of gamma functions with @xmath253 have to be evaluated ."
