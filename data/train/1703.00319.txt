    "the main objective of synthetic biology is the rational and systematic design of biological networks that can achieve de - novo functions such as the heterologous production of a metabolite of interest @xcite . besides the obvious necessity of developing experimental methodologies allowing for the reliable implementation of synthetic networks , tailored theoretical and computational tools for their design ,",
    "their analysis and their simulation also need to developed . indeed , theoretical tools that could predict certain properties ( e.g. a stable / oscillatory / switching behavior , controllable trajectories , etc . ) of a synthetic biological network from an associated model formulated , for instance , in terms of a reaction network @xcite , could pave the way to the development of iterative procedures for the systematic design of efficient synthetic biological networks .",
    "such an approach would allow for a faster design procedure than those involving fastidious experimental steps , and would give insights on how to adapt the current design in order to improve a certain design criterion . this way",
    ", synthetic biology would become conceptually much closer to existing theoretically - driven engineering disciplines , such as control engineering .        however , while such methods are well - developed for deterministic models ( i.e. deterministic reaction networks ) , they still lag behind in the stochastic setting .",
    "this lack of tools is quite problematic since it is now well - known that stochastic reaction networks @xcite are versatile modeling tools that can capture the inherent stochastic behavior of living cells @xcite and can exhibit several interesting properties that are absent for their deterministic counterparts @xcite . under the well - mixed assumption ,",
    "it is known @xcite that such random dynamics can be well represented as a continuous - time jump markov process evolving on the @xmath0-dimensional nonnegative integer lattice where @xmath0 is the number of distinct molecular species involved in the network .",
    "sufficient conditions for checking the ergodicity of open unimolecular and bimolecular stochastic reaction networks has have been proposed in @xcite and formulated in terms of linear programs .",
    "the concept of ergodicity is of fundamental importance as it can serve as a basis for the development of a control theory for biological systems . indeed , verifying the ergodicity of a control system , consisting for instance of an endogenous biomolecular network controlled by a synthetic controller ( see fig .  [ fig]*a * ) , would prove that the closed - loop system is well - behaved ( e.g. ergodic with bounded first- and second - order moments ) and that the designed control system achieves its goal ( e.g. set - point tracking and perfect adaptation properties ) .",
    "this procedure is analogous to that of checking the stability of a closed - loop system in the deterministic setting ; see e.g. @xcite . additionally , designing synthetic circuits achieving a given function that are provably ergodic could allow for the rational design of synthetic networks that can exploit noise in their function .",
    "a recent example is that of the antithetic integral feedback controller proposed in @xcite ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig]*b * ) that has been shown to induce an ergodic closed - loop network when some conditions on the endogenous network to be controlled are met .",
    "a major limitation of the ergodicity conditions obtained in @xcite is that they only apply to networks with fixed and known rate parameters  an assumption that is rarely met in practice as the rate parameters are usually poorly known and context dependent .",
    "this has motivated the consideration of networks with uncertain rate parameters in @xcite using two different approaches .",
    "the first one is quantitative and considers networks having an interval matrix as characteristic matrix @xcite .",
    "it was notably shown that checking the ergodicity and the output controllability of those networks reduces to checking the hurwitz stability of a single matrix and the output controllability of a single positive linear system .",
    "it was also shown that these conditions exactly write as a simple linear program having the same complexity as the program associated with the nominal case ; i.e. in the case of constant and fixed rate parameters .",
    "the second approach is qualitative and is based on the theory of sign - matrices @xcite which has been extensively studied and considered for the qualitative analysis of dynamical systems .",
    "sign - matrices have also been considered in the context of reaction networks , albeit much more sporadically ; see e.g. @xcite . in this case , again , the conditions obtained in @xcite can be stated as a very simple linear program that can be shown to be equivalent to some graph theoretical conditions .",
    "however , these approaches can be very conservative when the entries of the characteristic matrix of the network are not independent  a situation that appears when conversion reactions are involved in the networks . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "the actual parameter dependence needs to be exactly captured and many approaches exist to attack this problem such as , to cite a few , @xmath1-analysis @xcite , small - gain methods @xcite , eigenvalue and perturbation methods @xcite , interval matrices @xcite , sign - matrices @xcite , lyapunov methods @xcite , etc .",
    "as some of the methods just cited above can be conservative or may yield too complex conditions , we propose to develop an approach that is tailored to our problem by exploiting its inherent properties .",
    "several conditions for the robust ergodicity of unimolecular and biomolecular networks are first obtained in terms of a sign switching property for the determinant of the upper - bound of the characteristic matrix of the network .",
    "this condition also alternatively formulates as the existence of a positive vector depending polynomially on the uncertain parameters and satisfying certain inequality conditions .",
    "the complexity of the problem is notably reduced by exploiting the metzler structure of the matrices involved and through the use of various algebraic results such as the perron - frobenius theorem .",
    "the structural ergodicity of unimolecular networks is also considered and shown to reduce to the analysis of constant matrices when some certain realistic assumptions are met .",
    "it is notably shown in the examples that this latter result can be applied to bimolecular networks in some situations .",
    "the examples also illustrate that the proposed approach can be used to establish the robust or structural ergodicity of reaction networks for which the methods proposed in @xcite fail .",

    "their respective rate parameters are also given by @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and according to this structure , the stoichiometric matrix is decomposed as @xmath45 . before stating the main results of the section , we need to introduce the following terminology :    [ def : ab ] the _ characteristic matrix _ @xmath46 and the _ offset vector _",

    "this property plays an essential role in the derivation of the results of @xcite and will also be essential for the derivation of the main results of this paper .",

    "the underlying idea is to augment the open - loop network @xmath35 with an additional set of species and reactions ( the controller ) .",
    "the usual set - up is that this controller network acts on the production rate of the molecular species @xmath55 ( the _ actuated species _ ) in order to steer the mean value of the _ controlled species _",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 , to a desired set - point ( the reference ) . to the regulation problem",
    ", it is often sought to have a controller that can ensure perfect adaptation for the controlled species . as proved in @xcite , the antithetic integral control motif @xmath58 defined with @xmath59",

    "the following fundamental result states conditions under which a unimolecular reaction network can be controlled using an antithetic integral controller :    [ th : affine : nominal ] suppose that the open - loop reaction network @xmath35 is unimolecular and that the state - space of the closed - loop reaction network @xmath64 is irreducible .",

    "the reaction network consists of 6 reactions : 5 unimolecular reactions including 3 degradation reactions ( with rates @xmath222 and @xmath223 ) and 2 conversion reactions ( with rates @xmath224 and @xmath225 ) , and 1 bimolecular reaction that implements the contamination reaction that converts one susceptible person to an infectious one .",
    "the constraint @xmath53 enforces that @xmath226 , @xmath227 , where @xmath228 .",
    "this leads to @xmath229 since the entries are not independent , the use of sign - matrices or interval matrices are conservative .",
    "however , if we use theorem [ th : structural ] , then we can just substitute the parameters by 1 and observe that the resulting matrix is hurwitz stable to prove the structural stability of the matrix .",
    "alternatively , we can take @xmath230 and obtain @xmath231 from which the same result follows .",
    "we consider the circadian clock - model of @xcite which is described by the matrices @xmath232 where all the parameters are positive .",
    "even if initially the network consists of 9 species and 16 reactions , the problem can be reduced to the above problem involving 5 species ( the activator protein @xmath75 and its corresponding mrna @xmath233 , the activator protein @xmath234 and its corresponding mrna @xmath235 and a dimer @xmath236 composed of an activator protein @xmath75 and a repressor protein @xmath234 ) .",
    "there are 8 reactions : 7 unimolecular reactions including 4 degradation reactions ( with rates @xmath237 and @xmath238 ) , 2 catalytic reactions ( with rates @xmath239 and @xmath240 ) and one conversion reaction with rate @xmath241 ( with rate identical to the degradation rate of the activator protein @xmath75 ) , and one bimolecular reaction corresponding to the binding reaction of @xmath75 and @xmath234 .    as in the previous example",
    ", the condition reduces to @xmath242 where @xmath227 .",
    "clearly , we have four degradation reactions and two catalytic ones . using the last statement of theorem [ th : structural ] we get that the matrix @xmath243 .",
    "we also have in this case that @xmath244 and , hence , @xmath245 .",
    "hence , the system is structurally stable .",
    "alternatively , the triangular structure of the matrix would also lead to the same conclusion .",
    "let us consider here the following toy network where @xmath246 assume that @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "in such a case , the network consists of 5 unimolecular reactions : 2 degradation reactions with rates @xmath249 and @xmath250 and 3 conversion reactions with rates @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "then , we get that @xmath254 is hurwitz stable and hence that the matrix is structurally stable . however , if we assume now that @xmath255 , then the network still consists of 5 unimolecular reactions but now we have 2 degradation reactions with rates @xmath249 and @xmath250 , 1 conversion reaction with rate @xmath251 and 2 catalytic reactions with rates @xmath252 and @xmath253 . in such a case , we get @xmath256 where @xmath257 is hurwitz stable .",
    "we have in this case that @xmath258 and hence @xmath259 which has a spectral radius equal to 1 .",
    "hence , the matrix is not structurally stable .",
    "define now @xmath260 using a perturbation argument , we can prove that the 0-eigenvalue of @xmath261 locally bifurcates to the open left half - plane for some sufficiently small @xmath262 if and only if @xmath263 .",
    "hence , there exists a @xmath262 such that @xmath264 is hurwitz stable if and only if @xmath263 .",
    "noting now that @xmath265 and , hence , the determinant never switches sign , which proves that the matrix @xmath264 is structurally stable .",
    "several conditions have been proposed for checking the robust and the structural ergodicity of unimolecular and a certain class of bimolecular reaction networks . when certain conditions are met , the conditions can be verified using convex programming tools and/or through the computation of simple algebraic quantities .",
    "these results complement those of @xcite by providing a more accurate set of conditions .",
    "yet , improvements are still possible at the level of theorem [ th : uni_rob ] and theorem [ th : structural ] in order to avoid the use of complex numerical tools or to remove the need for simplifying assumptions .",
