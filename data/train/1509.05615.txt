    "one of the most simple extension of the standard model ( sm ) is to provide the latter an additional @xmath6 abelian symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the associated gauge boson  usually denoted by @xmath0 in the literature  has been given a particular attention in the last decades in particular as a potential candidate for mediating interaction between the dark sector and our visible world  @xcite .",
    "within this approach , the standard model fermions can be considered to be charged or not under the additional  so called @xmath7 in this paper  gauge group . in the case of charged fermions , a particular care must be devoted to anomaly cancellation and flavour changing constraints .",
    "the @xmath8 models are among the most popular example , and satisfy these requirements by considering a very heavy @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "string inspired models propose an anomaly cancellation a la green - schwarz @xcite where a very light @xmath7 mediator is generated with the use of axionic couplings and generalized chern - simons terms , or via stueckelberg realization of the @xmath0 boson  @xcite .",
    "another option is to consider neutral standard model fermions under the new gauge group @xmath7  @xcite .    by adding heavy degrees of freedom , charged under both sm and @xmath7 symmetries",
    ", one can generate effective operators of dimension six and compute an effective interaction lagrangian between a @xmath0 boson and the sm gauge bosons .",
    "such scenarios have already been studied in the context of dark matter ( dm ) model building  @xcite . in such framework ,",
    "dimension six operators are suppressed by a factor @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the mass of heavy fermions integrated out ) and the dark matter sector , charged under @xmath7 , couples with the weak or coloured sector of the standard model .",
    "an interaction with the weak sm sector was shown to have possible astrophysical signatures  @xcite , while a coupling to the coloured sm sector was constrained  @xcite using mono - jets events at the lhc  @xcite , as well as indirect detection constraints arising from astrophysical measurements .",
    "in this paper we focus on the case aforementioned where standard model fermions are neutral under @xmath7 and where the @xmath0 boson interacts with the standard model gluons through effective operators of dimension six ( and possibly to a dark matter sector ) .",
    "interactions between the @xmath0 mediator and the sm gluons will be detailed in section  [ section : themodel ] .",
    "the presence of such a feeble coupling has interesting features in the quark physics which may be discoverable during the run-2 ( @xmath11  =  13  tev ) of the lhc .",
    "therefore , this study aims to show what sensitivity can be reached for the theoretical model developed in  @xcite given the latest lhc run-1 ( @xmath11  =  7  or  8  tev ) experimental results . for completeness , the dark matter constraints and prospect studies for the lhc run-2 are also included . in section  [ section : pheno ]",
    "we discuss the possible experimental signatures .",
    "we notably identify two interesting and complementary channels that are analyzed in more details in sections  [ section : multijets ] and  [ section : fourtops ] , where we use the existing experimental constraints to investigate what would be the maximal coupling allowed for the @xmath0 interaction with the sm gluons .",
    "finally , in section  [ section : conclusions ] we present our conclusions concerning the potential of discovery of the model in the next years .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a new @xmath7 gauge group is added to the sm under which sm fermions are considered to be neutral  @xcite .",
    "effective operators of dimension six between the @xmath0 and the sm gluons are then assumed to be generated at the loop level by integration of heavy fermions ",
    "namely @xmath12 of mass @xmath10  charged both under @xmath7 and @xmath13 gauge symmetries .",
    "such loops produce at low energies effective interactions between the @xmath0 bosons and the sm gluons as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure : zprime_plot ] .",
    "the heavy fermions @xmath12 get mass through a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism of the @xmath7 symmetry with the use of a heavy higgs boson field ( @xmath14 ) . a gauge invariant lagrangian describing such a theory can be written by realizing the gauge symmetry non linearly , a la stueckleberg , as shown in what follows .",
    "the heavy higgs field can be written a la stueckelberg @xmath15 if the higgs boson mass is assumed to be much heavier than the @xmath0 boson",
    ". only the axionic component of the initial field thus remains in the low energy theory .",
    "the @xmath0 and the axion field transform non - linearly under @xmath7 as follows @xmath16 moreover , in order to write down a gauge invariant interaction lagrangian , the covariant derivatives of the axion @xmath17 and sm gluon fields are introduced @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the @xmath7 gauge coupling and @xmath20 stands for strong coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath7 invariant lagrangian under equation  ( [ u1x_transformation ] ) can finally be written as follows @xmath21 \\label{thefinallagragian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the lagrangian describing the standard model interactions , and the dual field - strength @xmath23 is introduced to protect the cp parity of the previous operators .",
    "an explicit computation of fermionic loops has been released in  @xcite where it has been shown that , interestingly , only the operators proportional to @xmath24 and @xmath25 are actually present in the theory and related as follows @xmath26 thus , only these two interaction terms will be considered in this study , the only free parameters remaining in the model being @xmath27 and the coupling constant @xmath19 . finally , for the @xmath28 interaction the interaction terms presented in equation  ( [ thefinallagragian ] ) can be written explicitly @xmath29 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\supset & \\frac{d_g}{m^2}\\left[g_x\\partial^mz'_m\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma }   \\partial_{\\mu}g^a_{\\nu}\\partial_{\\rho}g^a_{\\sigma } - g_xz'_{\\mu}\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma }   \\partial_{[\\nu}g^a_{m]}\\partial^m\\partial_{\\rho}g^a_{\\sigma}\\right ]   \\label{gluon01 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the two associated vertex functions for processes involving @xmath30 , symmetrized with respect to the two gluon functions , are simply @xmath31 \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the number of outgoing particles in the process considered .",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath19 can generically take values of order @xmath33 . for simplicity ,",
    "@xmath19 will be fixed in what follows to unity in order to incorporate it into the definition of the free coupling of the model , @xmath34 .    as far as constraints coming from dark matter are concerned",
    ", we will see in the next sections that the study of @xcite provides stringent constraints on the coupling @xmath27 for low masses of the @xmath0 using an analysis of the monojets + missing @xmath35 at the lhc ( 8 tev ) .",
    "such constraints will be only mentioned in the following study as a possible restriction of the results , since the presence of a gluophilic @xmath0 does not necessarily implies the presence of a dark sector  nor constitutes the exclusive possibility of interaction of dm with the sm .",
    "boson discussed here . ]    .decay widths of several @xmath0 decay channels , for various @xmath0 masses and an effective coupling @xmath36 .",
    "the branching ratio in the multijets channel @xmath37 always dominates almost exclusively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     measurements of rare standard model processes can be powerful tools to search for new physics in an indirect way . in our case , the @xmath0 boson , through its coupling to gluons , might play an indirect role in qcd physics and particularly in top quark physics .",
    "we estimated the leading order @xmath0-mediated contributions to the cross - sections of a few sm processes involving top or bottom quarks , such as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that potential @xmath0 contributions manifest themselves most visibly in the latter process , the associate production of four top quarks , thanks to the very small corresponding sm cross - section ( about 1 fb at @xmath42 tev ) .",
    "this is illustrated in table  [ tab : xsection_4tops ] , which provides cross - sections for a few @xmath0 masses .",
    "the cross - sections were computed at leading order with madgraph as described in the previous section . as it is especially relevant here",
    ", one should note that the cross - sections of the @xmath0-mediated contributions were seen not to depend on the @xmath0 decay width , the resonant contributions being suppressed by the landau - yang theorem .",
    "furthermore , we checked that interferences between standard model and @xmath0-mediated contributions are negligible ( below @xmath43 ) .",
    "the peculiar signature of four top quarks appears in various bsm scenarios such as supersymetry or new heavy quark generations , and is looked for at the lhc  @xcite . to evaluate the current sensitivity of these searches to @xmath0 bosons , we reinterpreted the results obtained in  @xcite in terms of upper limits on the @xmath0 effective coupling to gluons , as was done in the previous section . in this publication by the cms collaboration",
    ", events with four top quarks were looked for in the collision data produced by the lhc in 2012 ( @xmath42 tev , @xmath44 fb@xmath45 ) , using final states with one isolated lepton and jets .",
    "minimal requirements were placed on the missing transverse momentum in the event ( @xmath46 gev ) , the number of jets ( at least 7 with @xmath47 gev ) , and the scalar sum of selected jets and leptons transverse momentum ( @xmath48 gev ) , after what a boosted decision tree ( bdt ) was used to discriminate signal from background events , in four distinct categories ( electron or muon , exactly 7 or @xmath49 jets ) .",
    "the hypothetical signal yield was extracted through a combined fit of the final bdt discriminant distributions in the four categories .",
    "the absence of excess over the expected background lead to the establishment of an upper limit on the cross - section of the @xmath50 process of 32 fb , that is 24 times the signal strength of the standard model process . assuming that kinematic distributions do not vary significantly between standard model and @xmath0-mediated contributions , this limit can be directly translated into a limit on the @xmath0-gluon coupling .",
    "this new constraint is represented in fig  [ fig : results_run1 ] , together with the limits obtained from the three - jets final state and the dark matter - related constraints .",
    "one can notice that the four tops final state brings a useful complementarity to the other channels for very heavy @xmath0 ( above 3 tev ) , since the upper limit on the effective coupling increases only linearly with the @xmath0 mass , while the sensitivity in the three - jets channel vanishes quickly when the @xmath0 mass approaches the collider center - of - mass energy .",
    "+    * projections for the next lhc run at @xmath51tev *    -gluon coupling , together with current constraints established here and in  @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    for this channel as well , we estimated the discovery potential that may be achieved during the lhc second phase of exploitation at @xmath2 tev .",
    "heavy final states , such as those with four top quarks , will largely benefit from the increased center - of - mass energy . as can be seen in table  [ tab : xsection_4tops ] ,",
    "this is true not only for the standard model process ( cross - section increased by a factor 7 ) , but also for @xmath0-mediated contributions in much greater proportions ( a factor 200 increase ) .    taking the simplest but most approximate approach to extrapolate the current experimental results , we relied on the distributions of the bdt discriminant for the main backgrounds    ( @xmath52+light jets , @xmath53 ) and standard model @xmath54 contribution that are presented in the cms publication ( fig .  3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "we reweighted these distributions by the ratios of the leading order cross - sections between @xmath2 and 8 tev , which are respectively @xmath55 ( @xmath56 light jets ) , @xmath57 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we then used these reweighted distributions to evaluate the signal significance at @xmath2 tev through a combined fit of the signal strength in the four categories , the hypothesis test being performed again with the histfitter software .",
    "we assigned global systematic uncertainties of @xmath59 on the @xmath52+jets , and @xmath60 on the @xmath53 background predictions , reflecting the total uncertainties mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "we first checked that this configuration allowed us to reproduce the cms analysis result at 8 tev : we indeed obtained an upper limit on the @xmath50 cross - section only differing by 5% from the reference .",
    "[ fig : results_run2 ] presents the estimated sensitivity at 13 tev , again for integrated luminosities of @xmath61 and 100 fb@xmath45 .",
    "the sensitivity in terms of the effective coupling is improved by a factor 2 - 3 with respect to the sensitivity in this channel at 8 tev , but does not allow to go beyond the upper limits already set by the 7 tev experimental results in the three - jets channel apart at large @xmath0 masses ( above 2 tev ) , a region the four - tops channel is the best tool to probe .",
    "in this paper , we studied the effect of the presence of a gluophilic @xmath0 on multi - tops event at the lhc , and in particular three jets and four tops events .",
    "the only coupling parameter of the model - the effective coupling involved in dimension six operators - has been constrained in detailed from experimental searches released at 7 and 8 @xmath1 by cms along these two different channels .",
    "the latter restrictions led us to evaluate for which values of the parameter space a gluophilic @xmath0 could be discovered during the next run of the lhc .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the three jets invariant mass could provide a clear signal ( @xmath3 ) for masses of the @xmath0 above 300 @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the four tops events analysis could furnish a potential of discovery for heavy @xmath0 ( above @xmath5 ) .",
    "existing constraints coming from the study of dark matter  @xcite where the studied @xmath0 represents a possible mediator of the latter were furthermore added to the analysis , showing a tension with potential of discovery for low masses of the @xmath0 : masses lower than @xmath62 are disfavored to be detected from this perspective .    in conclusion , it is important to notice that a possible combination of both measured excesses in four top channels and three jets analysis ( for large invariant masses ) during the next run of the lhc could provide a clear signal of the presence of a gluophilic @xmath0 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the experimental signatures of a gluophilic @xmath0 at the lhc , in particular through the analysis of three jets or four tops events . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 couples to gluons through dimension six operators and the parameter space is constrained with experimental searches released at 7 and 8 @xmath1 by cms along these two different channels . </S>",
    "<S> existing constraints coming from the study of dark matter where the @xmath0 represents a possible mediator between the latter and the standard model are also included for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> prospects at @xmath2 tev allow us to evaluate for which values of the parameter space a gluophilic @xmath0 could be discovered during the next run of the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the analysis of the three jets invariant mass could provide a clear signal ( @xmath3 ) for masses of the @xmath0 above 300 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> four tops events bring in addition further discovery potential for heavy @xmath0 ( above @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of both signals in four top channels and three jets analyses during the next run of the lhc could thus provide a clear signal of the presence of a heavy gluophilic @xmath0 . </S>"
