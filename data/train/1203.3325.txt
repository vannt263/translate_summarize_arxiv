    "a crossover from the weakly - interacting bcs superfluid of cooper pairs to a bec of tightly - bound molecule - like pairs  @xcite is one of the most important phenomena in the physics of fermionic condensates  ( see also the review  @xcite ) .",
    "although the bcs - bec crossover was originally discussed in the context of semiconductor materials in the presence of superconducting correlations  @xcite  ( for recent activity on this subject , see @xcite ) , it was first demonstrated in experiments with ultracold superfluid fermi gases  @xcite . in the standard scenario",
    "the bcs - bec crossover for ultracold fermions is achieved via a feshbach resonance in the particle scattering .",
    "here we report a different mechanism to achieve the bcs - bec crossover , inducing it by _ quantum - size _ ( qs ) effects in a cigar - shaped superfluid fermi gas .",
    "the qs effects in superfluid or superconducting systems have their origin in the geometric quantization of the single - particle motion and reveal themselves in the oscillations of the basic condensate properties .",
    "such oscillations have been theoretically investigated in many different systems e.g. , ultrathin films  @xcite ; quantum striped superconductors and superconducting heterostructures at the atomic limit  @xcite ; superconducting metallic nanowires  @xcite ; and a pancake - shaped superfluid fermi gas  @xcite . recently , atomically uniform @xmath0 nanofilms were fabricated , which resulted in the first experimental observation of the qs oscillations in the critical temperature  @xcite . an interesting experimental study of @xmath1 fermi gas in a pancake - shaped trap was also recently reported  @xcite where the effects of the transverse quantization on the aspect ratio of the atomic cloud were demonstrated .",
    "this opens new prospects for the study of the qs oscillations of the properties of fermionic condensates in ultracold fermi gases with tunable confinement parameters .",
    "conventional understanding of the qs oscillations follows from the fact that the single - particle energy spectrum for the quantum - confined dimensions is tightly bound , whereas along the other dimensions it resembles a quasi - free dispersion .",
    "this results in the formation of a series of single - particle subbands .",
    "the lower edge ( bottom ) of such a subband coincides with the corresponding discrete single - particle level associated with the confined dimensions .",
    "when the energy spacing between subbands is systematically decreased , e.g. , by decreasing the relevant trapping frequency for superfluid fermionic atoms or the thickness of an atomically - uniform metallic nanofilm , the subband lower edges sequentially cross the chemical potential @xmath2 . each time this happens ,",
    "the single - particle density of states ( dos ) at @xmath2 increases , leading to a higher critical temperature , larger excitation gap , etc . , which is referred to as the shape or qs resonance  @xcite .",
    "in the present work , based on a study of a cigar - shaped ultracold superfluid fermi gas , we demonstrate that the qs coherent effects can not be fully understood in terms of the single - particle physics .",
    "the total or aggregate fermionic condensate in the system of interest is a coherent mixture of the subband components ( condensates ) , and _ each component _ undergoes a bcs - bec crossover when the lower edge of the corresponding single - particle subband crosses @xmath2 . as a result of such an _ atypical _ bcs - bec crossover ,",
    "the total condensate is a coherent mixture of both the bcs and bec - like components , which is most pronounced at the shape resonances .",

    "calculations are performed for zero temperature as the bdg equations are appropriate to describe the bcs - bec crossover in spatially nonuniform fermionic systems at nearly zero temperatures . in particular , it has been shown in @xcite that the bdg equations reproduce the gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate wave function on the bec side of the crossover .    to clearly display the underlying physics",

    "equation  ( [ 3d ] ) can be viewed as a system consisting of multiple condensates with the pairing gaps @xmath17 coupled through the interaction matrix @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , for the cigar - shaped trap the interlevel energy spacing corresponding to the quantization in the @xmath11 direction is sufficiently small so that the single - particle spectrum can be viewed as a sequence of the subbands @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , differences between @xmath33 s within the same subband are almost insignificant ( and disappear in the limit @xmath34 ) .",

    "as an illustration we consider a mixture of @xmath1 fermionic atoms with two interacting spin states , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . the corresponding scattering length @xmath50 can be significantly modified through a broad feshbach resonance with experimentally reported values on the bcs side from @xmath51 to @xmath52  @xcite . for our numerical calculations we take @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "[ sec : qs ] demonstrate that the redistribution of the fermionic condensate over the available subbands has a significant effect on @xmath71 .",
    "another contributing factor is the large variation in the subband pair size @xmath103 when the bottom of the corresponding subband crosses @xmath2 , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "a further insight is obtained by considering how @xmath104 decays with increasing @xmath40 .",

    "contrary to this , @xmath109 exhibits a crossover from the strongly localized ( at @xmath110 ) to the bcs weakly localized regime ( at @xmath111 ) when the system passes through the resonance associated with @xmath91 . at @xmath110 the lower edge of subbands @xmath93",

    "the contribution of subband @xmath99 decreases down to @xmath116 , as opposed to the contribution of subbands @xmath100 that increases up to about @xmath94 .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are understood as follows .",
    "when the lower edge of a single - particle subband is far below @xmath2 , the ratio of the pair - interaction energy  @xcite to the longitudinal kinetic energy in this subband is small , as expected in conventional weak - coupling bcs theory .",
    "however , when the subband edge approaches @xmath2 , the longitudinal kinetic energy is reduced , and the ratio strongly increases , which means that the pair - interaction prevails over the longitudinal motion .",
    "this forces the fermionic pairs in this subband to squeeze in the longitudinal direction [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "thus , the effect follows from a redistribution of the kinetic energy between the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom in the subband whose lower edge crosses @xmath2 .",
    "this drop in the fermionic - pair size is in fact an atypical example of the bcs - bec crossover that takes place in a single subband .",
    "however , unlike previously discussed systems , here the crossover is driven by the qs effects , which prompted the term _",
    "atypical_. qualitative difference between the partial condensates associated with different subbands explains the failure of the bcs estimate @xmath117 in the analysis of the results in figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "since the classical paper by cooper@xcite it is well - known that the configuration of the phase space available for the scattering of time - reversed fermions plays a crucial role for the formation of condensed fermionic pairs .",
    "indeed , only a strong enough attractive interaction between fermions with opposite spin in 3d is able to produce a two - body bound state in the vacuum .",
    "however , when the scattering of fermions is influenced by the presence of a filled fermi sea , i.e. , the available phase space is restricted by exclusion of the single - particle states inside the fermi sea , we arrive at the cooper instability resulting in the formation of weakly bound in - medium pairs of fermions for arbitrary strength of the attractive interaction .",
    "restricting the phase space by removing the filled fermi sea , one actually removes long range contributions in the cooper - pair wave function , which , say ,  encourage \" fermions to form in - medium bound states .",
    "our results show that the additional reconfiguration of the phase space , such that the band of single - particle states splits up into a series of lower - dimensional subbands , can further modify the scenario of pairing through the atypical bcs - bec crossover .",
    "obtained for @xmath53  ( at @xmath20 ) below the resonance at @xmath118  ( a ) , in the vicinity of the resonance at @xmath119  ( b ) and far beyond it at @xmath120  ( c ) . ]",
    "the bcs - bec crossover in a resonant subband also reveals itself in the properties of the aggregate condensate of the system .",
    "however , the effect depends on the relative contribution of a resonant subband .",
    "it is maximal at the corresponding resonance and diminishes away from the resonance .",
    "this contribution similarly drops when the total number of relevant subbands increases , and thus , as for other quantities , the lowest resonances ( i.e. , for @xmath91 and @xmath121 ) are the most visible in @xmath71 .",
    "effects of the subband bcs - bec crossover on the aggregate condensate can be estimated by calculating the quantity @xmath122  @xcite .",
    "for the bcs system @xmath123 , i.e. , the cooper - pair size greatly exceeds the mean distances between particles , and this leads to a considerable overlap between the fermionic pairs .",
    "for @xmath124 such an overlap is absent , and the system becomes a bec of tightly - bound point - like molecules .",
    "the intermediate crossover region is reached when @xmath125  @xcite . for @xmath126",
    "i.e. , just before the resonance at @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath127 and so the system is in the bcs regime . at @xmath95",
    "we find @xmath128 , which corresponds to the intermediate regime of the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "the size - dependent drops in @xmath71 become larger for smaller @xmath129  ( on the bcs side of the feshbach resonance ) , see fig .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "first , at smaller @xmath129 the energy window for contributing subbands also decreases , which means that the relative contribution of resonant subbands is larger .",
    "second , the difference between @xmath85 in neighboring subbands increases , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and ( d ) , and this increases the magnitude of variations in @xmath71 .    variations in @xmath71 are accompanied by substantial changes in the spatial profile of the order - parameter @xmath130 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the contour plots of @xmath131 for @xmath132 and @xmath20 , calculated ( a ) slightly below the resonance , at @xmath126 ; ( b ) close to the resonance , at @xmath95 , and ( c ) above the resonance , at @xmath111 . in the first case",
    "the pair condensate is almost uniformly distributed over the trap with two peaks at the edges of the condensate cloud .",
    "these peaks are typical for a confined bcs condensate and can be explained by the presence of the turning points in the trajectories of particles with energy close to @xmath2 . when the resonance develops [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] , the spatial distribution of the condensate acquires a pronounced bimodal character with an additional sizeable peak around @xmath133 due to the contribution of resonant subbands @xmath100 .",
    "the bimodal character clearly indicates that the system becomes a coherent mixture of two qualitatively different condensates : the first is associated with subband @xmath99 and has properties typical for the bcs system ; the second is due to resonant subbands @xmath100 and displays a typical bec - like behavior ( the formation of bosonic - like states distributed at the center of the trap ) .",

    "( [ eq : dens ] ) is convergent and the ultraviolet regularization is not required .",
    "here we discuss details of approximations involved in our study , including the anderson solution to the bdg equations , the ultraviolet regularization , and treating the interatomic collisions as a 3d process .    _",
    "the anderson solution_. our calculations are based on the bdg equations that can be , in principle , solved without additional approximations .",
    "however , for the sake of transparent physical interpretations , here we employ anderson s recipe for an approximate solution to the bdg equations , see eq .",
    "( [ ander ] ) .",
    "we recall that the anderson approximation incorporates only the pairing of the time - reversed states  @xcite , and the power of this approximation is based on the fact that the interaction matrix elements involving the time - reversed states are most pronounced as compared to other pairing combinations .",
    "corrections to the anderson solution were found in the range of a few percent for quasi-1d superconducting condensate in metallic nanowires  @xcite , which allows one to expect a similar accuracy of the anderson approximation for a cigar - shaped ultracold superfluid fermi gas .",
    "notice that the energy spacing between the single - particle levels is not directly related to the validity of the anderson ansatz .",
    "however , it can be an additional factor improving accuracy of the ansatz .",
    "indeed , when the energy spacing between single - particle levels exceeds the characteristic pairing energy , the pairing of non - time - reversed states is suppressed not only due to smaller coupling but , in addition , due to a large interlevel spacing between the non - time - reversed states . in this case",
    "the anderson approximation becomes practically exact .",
    "however , when the interlevel energy spacing is small as compared to the pairing energy , this does not necessarily mean a breakdown of the anderson approximation .",
    "the pairing of the non - time - reversed states will not be pronounced anyway , thanks to the classical argumentation by anderson  @xcite .",
    "for instance , anderson s recipe yields exact solution for bulk superconductors where the pairing energy is much larger than the interlevel energy spacing .    _",
    "the ultraviolet regularization_. notice that our simplified 3d - like regularization differs from the rigorous procedure reported by bruun and coauthors @xcite for spatially nonuniform systems by the absence of an additional corrective term .",
    "however , following arguments by bruun himself and heiselberg in @xcite [ see the discussion just above eq .",
    "( 15 ) in this reference ] , one can expect that the role of this corrective term is not significant .",
    "moreover , the authors of ref .   introduced a simple cut - off @xmath140 and argued that such a cut - off is  a first approximation to the more rigorous procedure of bruun et al . \" for trapped fermi gases . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show results for @xmath74 calculated with this cut - off versus our data from fig .  [ fig1](a ) . though @xmath74 based on the cut - off procedure is slightly different as compared to the averaged gap calculated from eq .",
    "( [ 3d ] ) , this difference practically disappears with a small shift in the scattering length , i.e. , @xmath141 , in the cut - off data .",
    "thus , one can conclude that our simplified ultraviolet regularization , which becomes exact by increasing the number of subbands as the radial confinement is reduced , does not affect our conclusions .    _ interatomic collisions_. several explanations about interatomic collisions in the cigar - shaped fermi gas are also needed . for our trapping potential",
    "we have @xmath142 , and looking at this aspect ratio , one might get the impression that the two - particle scattering has an effectively-1d character here .",

    "<S> quantum - size oscillations of the basic physical characteristics of a confined fermionic condensate are a well - known phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> its conventional understanding is based on the single - particle physics , whereby the oscillations follow variations in the single - particle density of states driven by the size quantization . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a study of a cigar - shaped ultracold superfluid fermi gas , which demonstrates an important many - body aspect of the quantum - size coherent effects , overlooked previously . </S>",
    "<S> the many - body physics is revealed here in the atypical crossover from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) induced by the size quantization of the particle motion . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle energy spectrum for the transverse dimensions is tightly bound , whereas for the longitudinal direction it resembles a quasi - free dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the formation of a series of single - particle subbands ( shells ) so that the aggregate fermionic condensate becomes a coherent mixture of subband condensates . </S>",
    "<S> each time when the lower edge of a subband crosses the chemical potential , the bcs - bec crossover is approached in this subband , and the aggregate condensate contains both bcs and bec - like components . </S>"
