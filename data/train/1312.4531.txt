    "for some evolved objects it is not clear whether the stars are still dispersing their gas and are in the `` transition '' phase , or if the disc is sufficiently gas - free that it can be considered a true debris disc .",

    "the possibility of confusion of the iras emission with another nearby source , which is visible to the south - west in higher resolution images , meant that the excess was only detected unambiguously from 8 - 20  @xmath1 m .",

    "the very large disc luminosity ( @xmath29% ) , the fact that the excess spectrum extends over a wide range of wavelengths ( fig [ fig : phot ] ) , and the probable variability suggests at first glance that the emission is probably from a young ( @xmath1710  myr old ) star that hosts a gas - rich protoplanetary disc .",

    "the most promising way to discern between these possibilities and to find a self - consistent explanation is to determine the age of hd  166191 .",
    "there are several techniques available to infer the ages of young stars . in this section",
    "we attempt to refine the age of hd  166191 using the empirical methods of lithium depletion and x - ray activity , combined with kinematic considerations and ( model - dependent ) isochrone placement .",
    "because it is efficiently destroyed in stellar interiors , photospheric lithium abundance can serve as a mass - dependent clock over pre - main sequence ages .",
    "our lii @xmath316708 equivalent width , @xmath32  m , agrees with the high - resolution value reported by @xcite ( @xmath33  m ) . at the spectral type of hd  166191 this value is consistent with an age less than the pleiades .",
    "the poor age constraint of lithium depletion in solar - type stars is due to their radiative cores effectively separating the convective outer layers from the hotter interiors , preventing lithium depleted material from reaching the photosphere .",
    "x - ray emission is another common diagnostic of stellar youth , a manifestation of the strong magnetic fields and fast rotation rates observed in young stars .",
    "hd  166191 was not detected in the _ rosat _ all - sky x - ray survey ( rass ) .",
    "the rass 0.12.4 ev limiting flux ( @xmath34 erg @xmath35 s@xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 119  pc implies an x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratio of @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite report a detection in the xmm - newton serendipitous source catalog , which yields a 0.212 ev luminosity of @xmath37 erg s@xmath13 and @xmath38 . ignoring the subtleties of comparing results from different x - ray observatories and energy bands , we compare these values to the results of @xcite , who examined the mass - dependence of x - ray emission in young stars in orion as a function of age .",
    "their distributions shows that while hd  166191 is one of the x - ray faintest 1-@xmath39 stars at 1 - 10  myr ages , the x - ray luminosity also varies by about 2 orders of magnitude at a given age .",
    "comparison with the x - ray luminosity distribution in @xcite leads to the same conclusion .",
    "therefore , though it is indeed x - ray faint as noted by @xcite , we do not consider this faintness to provide a significantly stronger age constraint than the lithium absorption .",
    "kinematics are commonly used to assign young stars to moving groups or associations of known age . from _ hipparcos _",
    "astrometry and the 2.3-m / wifes radial velocity we calculate a heliocentric space motion for hd  166191 of @xmath40  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "this agrees with the velocity presented by @xcite from tycho-2 proper motions .",
    "figure  [ fig : uvwxyz ] shows the position and velocity of hd  166191 compared other nearby young stars . while the star s space motion is consistent with members of several young stellar associations , including the scorpius - centaurus ob association ( sco - cen ) , its relatively large distance ( 119@xmath41  pc ) and low galactic latitude yields a heliocentric position , @xmath42  pc , distinct from other young groups in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "like @xcite , we searched for _ hipparcos _ entries around hd  166191 with similar proper motions and parallaxes and found a match with the well - studied ` isolated ' herbig ae star hd  163296 ( 119@xmath43  pc ) .",
    "@xcite used the xhip @xcite radial velocity ( @xmath44  km  s@xmath13 ) for hd  163296 from @xcite via @xcite .",
    "this is the mean velocity of a single line ( mgii @xmath314481 ) from seven mt.wilson plates ( @xmath45  km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite reported larger velocities of @xmath46  km  s@xmath13  and @xmath47  km  s@xmath13 , respectively . using the latter value and",
    "_ hipparcos _ astrometry we calculate a space motion of @xmath48  km  s@xmath13 , in excellent agreement with hd  166191 .     were adopted from .",
    "the tycho-2 @xmath49-band magnitude for hd  166191 was transformed to the johnson - cousins system using the relations of @xcite .",
    "no extinction was adopted for hd  166191.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of both stars is plotted in fig.[fig : cmd ] . if hd  166191 and hd  163296 are co - eval then they should lie along the same theoretical isochrone in such a diagram .",
    "compared to parsec @xcite and isochrones , hd  163296 has an age of 45  myr , consistent with previous isochronal age estimates from a variety of model grids .",
    "hd  166191 falls slightly older , with an age of 510  myr .",
    "this age agrees with the ( conservative ) @xmath50  myr cmd age reported by @xcite using the parsec models and 2mass @xmath51 magnitudes .",
    "we adopted the @xmath52-band photometry to minimise the effects of disc emission observed in both stars at wavelengths greater than 2 @xmath1 m ( see  [ sss : spex ] ) .",
    "the derived masses of hd  166191 are 1.7 and @xmath53 from the parsec and isochrones respectively .",
    "neither star shows signs of unresolved binarity . given their proximity ( 7.5 pc in space ) , identical distances , congruent space motions and very similar ages ,",
    "it is likely hd  166191 and hd  163296 form a co - eval , co - moving pair of @xmath04 - 5  myr - old stars .",
    "hd  163296 was proposed as an outlying member of the 1020  myr - old sco - cen subgroup upper cen - lup by @xcite .",
    "this membership is unlikely considering its young age and heliocentric position and velocity ( fig.[fig : uvwxyz ] ) .",
    "instead , we speculate that hd  166191 and hd  163296 may represent the first members of a yet - to - be - discovered kinematic association or new sco - cen subgroup . having now established the likely youth of hd  166191 using a cmd and by association with hd  163296 , it seems that a less extreme interpretation for the large ir excess may be that of a gaseous transition disc , in contrast to the debris disc interpretation of @xcite .",
    "the interpretation favoured by @xcite is that hd  166191 hosts a warm terrestrial zone debris disc , the result of collisions between planetesimals or planets during the late stages of planet formation .",
    "however , the total fractional luminosity @xmath54 of the excess spectrum is about 10% , meaning that the dust in a putative debris disc must capture at least this much of the starlight .",
    "if the dust has a non - negligible albedo or is optically thick along the line of sight the fraction of starlight captured must be higher . as we show below ,",
    "because such extreme ir excesses may require optically thick dust , significantly more than 10% of the starlight may need to be captured .",
    "an additional complication in the case of hd  166191 is that @xcite infer a cool outer component based on the breadth of the emission spectrum , with a fractional luminosity similar to the inner component .",
    "while such a two - belt structure is of course possible ( e.g. the solar system has two belts ) , the extreme brightness of the hd  166191 disc means that the inner belt must capture @xmath06% of the starlight , yet be sufficiently optically thin or misaligned that the outer belt is still able to capture @xmath04% .",
    "these constraints set lower limits on the vertical extent of the inner and outer belts , which can be compared with observations of edge - on belts around other stars .     and @xmath55 .",
    "the dashed lines show how the radial optical depth of the inner belt depends on the opening angle .",
    "the observed fractional luminosity can not be produced for opening angles in the shaded regions ( where @xmath56 ) .",
    "the solid lines show constant radial optical depth for the outer belt ( eq [ eq : outer ] ) .",
    "the dotted line shows where the belts have equal opening angles.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to make a simple model of the above picture we assume that i ) the two belts are coplanar , ii ) have uniform density , iii ) the dust in the belts has negligible albedo , iv ) the belts are optically thin from the viewing direction , and v ) reemission from either belt does not heat the star or the other belt .",
    "we use parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the fractional luminosity and opening angle of the inner ( i ) and outer ( o ) belts respectively .",
    "the radial optical depth of inner belt , @xmath59 , is related to the opening angle by @xmath60 that is , the fraction of starlight captured by the inner belt , and hence the fractional luminosity , is the radial optical depth multiplied by the fraction of the sky that it covers as seen by the star . when it is optically thick , increasing the radial optical depth does not increase the belt brightness ( i.e. in equation [ eq : inner ] , @xmath61 ) , so the opening angle of the inner belt must be at least 7@xmath62 .",
    "the radial optical depth is correspondingly lower if the opening angle is larger , with a lower a limit of 0.06 if the belt is a spherical shell ( i.e. @xmath63 ) .",
    "the outer belt is always shadowed by the inner belt to some degree .",
    "if the opening angle of the outer belt is less than that of the inner belt , all light illuminating the outer belt must pass through the inner belt , with the light attenuated by a factor @xmath64 ( with a minimum value of zero ) .",
    "if the inner belt is fatter than the outer belt , then only a fraction of the light heating the outer belt is intercepted by the inner belt , and the outer belt thickness is independent of the inner belt thickness ( for fixed @xmath65 ) . in these two regimes ,",
    "the radial optical depth of the outer belt , @xmath66 ( also @xmath671 ) , is related to its opening angle and the inner belt properties by @xmath68    these relations are shown by the solid lines in figure [ fig : opang ] , which uses the parameter space of @xmath69 vs. @xmath70 .",
    "dashed lines show constant inner belt optical depth , where the minimum inner belt opening angle is set by @xmath71 .",
    "the solid lines show equation ( [ eq : outer ] ) for three different inner belt optical depths .",
    "there are two different regimes for each line ; if @xmath72 the outer belt is fully shadowed by the inner and there is a tradeoff between the opening angles of each , the thinner the inner belt the more it shadows the outer belt due to increased optical depth , and the thicker the outer belt must be .",
    "this regime is shown by the curved part of the solid lines .",
    "if @xmath73 the outer belt is thicker than the inner and changes in the inner belt thickness do not change the outer belt brightness .",
    "that is , a thicker inner belt occults the outer belt more , but is less optically thick for the same fractional luminosity .",
    "the @xmath74 line tends towards , but never reaches @xmath75 for large @xmath70 , which would be the minimum opening angle in the absence of the inner belt .",
    "therefore , if both belts are to be relatively thin the minimum opening angles allowed by this simple analysis are about 7@xmath62 for the inner component , and @xmath012@xmath62 for the outer belt ( i.e. the left end of the lowest solid line ) .",
    "this minimum assumes that both components are radially optically thick , and that no light is lost to scattering , the latter being a reasonable approximation given that typical albedoes for small bodies in the solar system and in other debris discs are @xmath010% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other two solid lines show that even for larger opening angles the belts must have relatively large radial optical depths , purely due to the high fractional luminosity .",
    "there are few debris discs where the opening angles can be measured , though a wealth of information is available for the solar system .",
    "the inclinations of asteroid belt objects vary widely , with most objects below 10@xmath62 ( an opening angle of 20@xmath62 ) , and similar values for kuiper belt objects .",
    "similarly , the full - width at half - maximum brightness opening angle of the @xmath16 pictoris disc is @xmath010@xmath62 at about 130au @xcite , and the au microscopii disc is even thinner at @xmath05@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the opening angles inferred for the inner and outer hd  166191 disc components are comparable with observed discs .",
    "however , this similarity requires that both components are radially optically thick _ and _ optically thin in the viewing direction , or the opening angles must be larger . for a typically inclined viewing geometry ( @xmath060@xmath62 )",
    "such a configuration is unlikely , so unless the disc components are much more radially extended than they are vertically , and the system is viewed face - on , the opening angles are probably larger then our estimated minimum .",
    "the star is not seen to be reddened , and given the large optical depths seen in figure [ fig : opang ] the star is very probably seen directly and not obscured by the disc . in summary , this comparison is suggestive that the two - belt debris model requires relatively large optical depths for reasonable opening angles , but does not strongly argue against such an interpretation .",
    "now considering the plausibility of the debris disc interpretation in terms of a collisional model , the central issue is the lifetime of such extreme levels given the @xmath05  myr age of hd  166191 . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the dust lifetime due to collisions at about 1au is only a few years so they must be replenished ; a late - stage planetary embryo impact or ongoing collisions in a massive asteroid - belt analogue are the possible sources .",
    "while either the inner or outer disc component could be the result of a collision analogous to the earth - moon forming event , the extremely bright period that follows such a collision is probably short lived .",
    "the length of this period is uncertain due to the possibility of non - axisymmetry and an inability to remove dust at high optical depth , but given the rapid evolution shown in figure 14 of @xcite , less than 100 - 1000 years seems a reasonable estimate .",
    "if the outer belt is several times more distant the emission will decay more slowly , by roughly a few orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , for a 5  myr old star it may be unlikely to observe short lived bright dust emission .",
    "however , this star was of course picked from a large sample of stars due to its extremely bright excess and several giant collisions are expected during terrestrial planet building ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the alternative scenario suggested by @xcite is dust resulting from ongoing collisions in a massive asteroid belt .",
    "the issue here is the same as above ; such extreme brightness requires a significant mass in large objects to generate a large surface area of dust , but this mass ( and hence space density ) also requires that the collisions between the large objects are very frequent .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed using a simple collision model that the maximum fractional luminosity for young stars is @xmath00.1% ( see their figure 3 ) . alternatively , using equation 21 of @xcite , to maintain a fractional luminosity above 6% , the maximum time the inner belt has been evolving for is of order 1,000 years , with a few orders of magnitude uncertainty ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another consideration for the massive asteroid - belt analogue scenario is the disc mass .",
    "@xcite estimate the mass in dust present in the inner belt to be roughly @xmath76 to @xmath77 g .",
    "however , because the debris disc interpretation explicitly implies that this mass is replenished by destruction of larger objects , the dust mass is a negligible fraction of the total mass for typical debris disc size distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using equation 15 from we can calculate the total mass present in a size distribution from 1  @xmath1 m sized grains up to 100 km objects using a standard differential size distribution slope of -3.5 . converting the 760k and 175k temperatures of the belts @xcite to radii of 0.3au and 6au , and using the fractional luminosities of 0.06 and 0.04 yields total masses of 1.7 and 400@xmath78 for the inner and outer belts respectively . for reference ,",
    "the minimum mass contained in the solar nebula was a few hundred earth masses so the inferred mass for the outer belt is very large , if relatively large planetesimals are assumed . for our assumed @xmath79 particle size distribution , the total mass scales as the square root of the maximum size , so for much smaller 10 m planetesimals ,",
    "the mass is also much smaller at @xmath80 .",
    "however , the collisional lifetime calculated above is also a function of planetesimal size ( @xmath81 ) and assumed @xmath82 km , so the outer belt lifetime for such small planetesimals would be of order 1000 years .",
    "therefore , there is a trade - off between planetesimal size and disc lifetime , meaning that either the disc is relatively massive , or its lifetime at the curent brightness is very short .    in summary",
    ", we can not rule out the debris disc interpretation of @xcite .",
    "we have shown i ) that dust replenished by collisions either requires near optically thick belts or relatively large disc opening angles and ii ) that the outer belt is relatively massive if it is the result of ongoing collisions or has a very short lifetime .",
    "hd  166191 was selected as potentially interesting from a parent population of @xmath8324,000 hipparcos stars @xcite and is therefore a rare object within this sample , meaning that arguments against the debris disc interpretation that rely on hd  166191 being observed at a special time may not be robust . as we have noted however , there is another possible interpretation ; a protoplanetary disc made up of both gas and dust , as is seen around many stars that have similar ages to hd  166191 .          to test whether hd  166191 can be modelled as a protoplanetary disc we modelled the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) using the monte carlo radiative transfer code mcfost . here",
    ", we used a parametric disc extending from an inner radius @xmath84 to an outer radius @xmath85 . with this approach ,",
    "the model is of a dust disc that is implicitly well mixed with the gas that makes up most of the total mass in the disc .",
    "the dust density distribution has a gaussian vertical profile , and the dust surface density profile and the scale height are defined as power - law distributions with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , where @xmath88 is the radial coordinate in the equatorial plane and @xmath89 is the scale height at a fiducial radius @xmath90 = 100 au .",
    "the dust grains are assumed to be homogeneous and spherical amorphous silicates with a differential grain size distribution of the form @xmath91 , between a minimum grain size @xmath92 and a maximum grain size @xmath93 .",
    "the dust extinction and scattering opacities , scattering phase functions , and mueller matrices are calculated using mie theory .    in order to fit the sed data , we first searched for a satisfactory solution by hand , which was used as the starting point for an automated best fit search with a genetic algorithm . in the absence of strong constraints from direct imaging ( the _ herschel _ observations require @xmath94 au ) ,",
    "we have set the external radius @xmath95 au .",
    "this value is not well constrained by the sed modelling , in particular because of the lack of photometric data longer than 160 @xmath1 m .",
    "the parameters of the best fitting solution are presented in table [ tab : parameters ] and the resulting sed is presented in figure [ fig : rtmod ] .",
    "the fit to the data is sufficiently good to show that the hd  166191 spectrum can be interpreted as a protoplanetary disc .",
    "a prominent feature of the sed is the 10 @xmath1 m silicate emission , though we did not thoroughly explore the mineralogical composition of the disc .",
    "however , to better match the general profile of the 10 @xmath1 m feature we added a fraction of crystalline silicates @xcite to the dust mixture .",
    "the crystalline silicates have a size distribution ranging from 0.03 to 5 @xmath1 m .",
    "the amorphous silicates have a size distribution ranging form 0.03 to 9 @xmath1 m .",
    "this value for the maximum size of the amorphous silicates is poorly constrained because of the lack of data longer than 160 @xmath1 m .",
    "both species are distributed similarly in the disc .",
    "the genetic algorithm found the best model for a composition made of 18% of crystalline silicates , similar to the fraction of warm crystalline silicates found by in a study of 58 t tauri stars with irs spectra .",
    "the resulting model requires the scale height to be about 4 au at @xmath96 au ( or @xmath97 ) .",
    "this is smaller than the `` standard '' protoplanetary disc models that usually have @xmath98 , indicating that the dust has settled towards the midplane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the derived inner radius of 0.95  au suggests that the disc has an inner hole , which along with the lack of detectable accretion (  [ ss : sso ] ) is consistent with a several myr old object that has started the transition from a full protoplanetary disc to a debris disc .",
    "the inner hole size is smaller than most transition discs , but a wide range of sizes is seen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the implication for hd  166191 itself is that the star probably hosts a protoplanetary disc rather than an exceptionally bright debris disc .",
    "the young age does not of course require that the disc is primordial , but places hd  166191 in the @xmath11210  myr age range where sun - like stars are seen to host such discs .",
    "while we can not rule out the extreme debris disc interpretation , we have noted potential issues (  [ ss:2b ] ) , and suggest that the disc is actually gas - rich .",
    "our protoplanetary disc interpretation is corroborated by the fact that the disc spectrum is consistent with a fairly standard model for a protoplanetary disc ( see  [ ss : rt ] ) .",
    "the spectrum shows evidence for clearing in the innermost regions , as expected given typical evolutionary sequences , and grain settling in the outer regions , both signatures of discs whose evolution is well advanced beyond their initial state , as would be expected for a @xmath05  myr old star .",
    "further clues to the nature of the disc lie in the bass spectrum , which is compared to other discs and comet hale bopp s coma in figure [ fig : midircomp ] .",
    "here we have divided each spectrum by a blackbody at the appropriate temperature to produce `` emissivity '' spectra , which far better show spectral features common to objects emitting at different temperatures .",
    "of particular note here is the similarity between the hd  166191 and hd  163296 peaks around 10  @xmath1 m .",
    "compared to hd  113766a , another candidate for ongoing terrestrial planet formation , the hd  166191 silicate peak is broader and is not double peaked .",
    "such differences in the shape of the silicate feature are diagnostic of the grain sizes and composition , which can subsequently be related to their evolutionary state .",
    "one approach is to derive compositions for objects of a range of age via modelling , and then comparing the results in terms of an evolutionary sequence .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that their derived values for the olivine to pyroxene ratio change with age .",
    "@xcite show the olivine to pyroxene ratio and total olivine fraction derived from modelling for 19 objects in their figure 7 .",
    "older objects have greater olivine fractions , both in absolute terms and relative to pyroxene , with hd  163296 appearing as one of the least evolved objects and hd  113766a appearing as a moderately evolved object . therefore , because the spectrum of hd  166191 appears very similar in shape to hd  163296 , and different to hd  113766a , the evolutionary state of the hd  166191 dust appears more primordial .",
    "this conclusion would of course be strengthened by detailed modeling of a 5 - 35 @xmath1 m spectrum , as was done for the other systems in fig 7 , which allows for verification of the 8 - 13 @xmath1 m silicate identifications using the secondary 16 - 33 @xmath1 m silicate features .",
    "we thus look forward to obtaining a detailed spectrum of the hd166191 system in the 13 - 30 @xmath1 m range , e.g. with jwst .        the overall disc spectrum should also be put in context with entire disc spectra at other stages to better picture hd  166191 as part of a possible evolutionary sequence .",
    "figure [ fig : speccomp ] compares the overall 0.5 - 160 @xmath1 m hd  166191 sed with some examples of other protoplanetary and debris discs around ( approximately ) sun - like stars , all scaled to a similar photospheric level at 2@xmath1 m , with the exception of ry  tau for which the photosphere is not visible at this wavelength .",
    "we have not attempted to correct the shorter wavelength photometry for reddening as we are here concerned with the longer wavelengths .",
    "these represent something of an evolutionary sequence ; ( i ) the youngest discs , represented here by ry  tau , have a relatively flat spectral slope across near / mid - ir wavelengths , but at the onset of disc dispersal ( ii ) an inner hole develops and the spectrum has a flux deficit in the mid - ir and little change in the far - ir and sub - millimetre flux ( e.g. gm  aur , * ? ? ? * ) , the final debris disc phase ( iii ) begins when the gas disc is dispersed , and generally the disc has a spectrum that is typically very similar to a pure blackbody , but in some rare cases shows significant levels of warm emission , which is commonly interpreted as a sign of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "both protoplanetary and debris discs show solid - state 10  @xmath1 m silicate features , so their presence or otherwise does not indicate the evolutionary state in this broad comparison ( though as discussed above their shape is important ) .    within the context of this simple evolutionary sequence , hd",
    "166191 shows characteristics that might individually be attributed to either a transitional or a debris disc .",
    "the disc shows evidence for an inner hole with little near - ir dust emission , though the hole is probably not as large or well cleared as for gm aur given the larger mid - ir excess . in an inside - out evolution picture such as photoevaporation ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , the hd  166191 disc might be considered less evolved than gm aur in the inner regions . however , as we note below it may be that the inner emission is being enhanced by dust produced during terrestrial planet formation , which could happen before and/or after an inner hole develops .",
    "a significant difference with gm aur is a lower level of far - ir and sub - millimetre excess , suggesting that the hd  166191 disc is significantly less flared as a result of a lower disc mass and/or dust grains settling to the disc midplane .",
    "indeed , comparison of the hd  166191 far - ir emission with hd  181327 , a young ( @xmath010  myr ) bright debris disc , shows that the two have similar levels of excess , and that both are lower than `` typical '' protoplanetary discs such as ry tau and gm aur . this comparable level of far - ir flux suggests that in addition to being less flared , that the hd  166191 disc could be well advanced in the transition to a debris disc in the outer regions .",
    "similarly evolved discs have been observed around lower mass stars , suggesting that such a spectrum is not particularly unusual .",
    "for example , in the @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 diagram of ( their figure 11 ) , hd  166191 would lie among the `` depleted discs '' , indicating significant evolution and lower scale heights .",
    "how far advanced the transition to the debris disc phase is will require a gas detection or stringent limits .",
    "finally , comparing hd  166191 with hd  113766a , a bright warm debris disc , the 0.5 - 160 @xmath1 m spectrum continua look very similar ; hd  113766a plausibly looks like a somewhat more evolved and fainter version of hd  166191 . given that hd  166191 can be modelled as a transition disc , such a comparison suggests that the interpretation of hd  113766a , which has thus far been classed as a debris disc , , deserves further consideration .",
    "for example , it may be that the two - component structure inferred from the combination of mid - ir interferometry @xcite and far - ir photometry is actually indicative of an inner disc that is significantly extended , as might be expected for a protoplanetary disc .",
    "however , @xcite set stringent limits on gas levels in the inner regions of the hd  113766a disc using the irs spectrum , and the dust emission may therefore not be primordial without gas to protect it from radiation forces .",
    "in addition , we have already argued that hd  113766a appears more evolved based on the mid - ir silicate feature ( figure [ fig : midircomp ] ) .",
    "this possibility leads us to a third interpretation for the hd  166191 disc ( that also applies to hd  113766a ) that we have not yet considered ; a combination of scenarios where the outer disc is still gaseous with significantly settled dust , while the inner regions are in the late stages of , or have already made , the transition to the debris phase . in this case the excess might be again thought of as comprising two components ; an inner warm component due at least in part to ongoing terrestrial planet formation ( but perhaps also the remnants of the protoplanetary disc ) , and a well settled outer component with residual gas .",
    "remnant gas may help maintain dust levels produced by collisions , reducing the timescale problems that arise in the debris disc scenario , where dust is removed easily by radiation forces .",
    "following such a phase , it may be that large cool discs such as hd  181327 emerge as the inner regions collide and decay , and are then observed around older stars as `` typical '' ( i.e. longer lived ) debris discs at radii of tens to hundreds of au .",
    "there are several possible scenarios for this sequence however .",
    "for example , hd  166191 could already host a debris disc that lies inside the protoplanetary disc and is currently undetectable , but will emerge as the protoplanetary disc continues to disperse .",
    "alternatively , it may be that the birth of a debris disc requires stirring of planetesimals to sufficient velocities through formation of large protoplanets , so the hd  166191 spectrum may in the future drop to much fainter levels , but then become brighter again once the debris phase begins ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the single most important difference between the scenarios we have discussed , and the fundamental difference between our transition disc interpretation and the debris disc interpretation of @xcite , is the presence or absence of gas . while the bass spectrum is more similar to protoplanetary discs and argues that the silicate emission is relatively primordial , this signature comes from dust .",
    "a disc that is still in transition to the debris disc phase will have some remaining gas , while a true debris disc will have negligible gas .",
    "there is currently no evidence for gas in the hd  166191 disc , either from gas accretion onto the star nor directly from the disc ( e.g. from near - ir co emission in the spex spectrum ) . indeed , one apparent reason @xcite reject the @xmath05  myr age suggested by the cmd in favour of an older 10 - 100  myr age is based on the lack of h@xmath15 emission .",
    "however , many young stars with protoplanetary discs are not seen to accrete gas , particularly transition discs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and accretion is not necessarily expected during this phase either ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "detection , or a strongly constraining non - detection , of gas around hd  166191 is therefore an obvious way in which the disc may be further characterised .",
    "hd  166191 has been known to host an infrared excess for several decades , but the origin of this excess was unclear .",
    "new surveys by the akari and wise telescopes have led to renewed interest , and suggestions that the excess is due to a rare bright debris disc or an evolved protoplanetary disc @xcite .",
    "though we can not rule out the debris disc interpretation , we argue that the excess is most simply interpreted as a relatively normal protoplanetary transition disc .",
    "this conclusion is supported by our findings that i ) hd  166191 is very likely associated and co - eval with the previously isolated @xmath04  myr old herbig ae star hd  163296 , ii ) the disc spectrum can be modelled by a protoplanetary transition disc , and iii ) the mid - ir silicate feature is a good match to other young objects , such as hd  163296 .",
    "this finding may represent the first hint of a new nearby young stellar association or subgroup of scorpius - centaurus .    by comparing hd  166191 with other known protoplanetary and debris discs",
    ", we argue that the hd  166191 disc is more evolved than most transition discs , and suggest some possible scenarios for the late stages of the protoplanetary to debris disc transition .",
