    "on the one hand , the studies can be helpful technologically in managing the generated heat in nanoelectronic devices .",
    "on the other hand , investigations about thermoelectric effects in mesoscopic regimes are of fundamental interest for condensed matter physicists . the thermoelectric properties of graphene have been also studied both experimentally and theoretically with special focus on the charge neutrality ( the dirac ) point@xcite .",
    "one of the key findings has been the sign change of the thermoelectric power across the dirac point when the carriers type switches from electron to hole , accompanied by the enhancement behavior of seebeck coefficient.@xcite .",
    "beginning in the late 1980 s the field of spintronics emerged which focuses on the characteristic of spin - dependent transport and its coupling to the charge@xcite . along with the fast developing and high demanding interest in this field , the seminal work of johnson and silsbee displayed that , in spintronic and magnetic devices , heat currents can couple to the spin currents and also the charge currents@xcite .",
    "moreover , some succeeding unexpected experimental achievements of spin seebeck effects@xcite , attracted great attention to study the thermoelectric and spintronic effects together which steer to the introduction of a new research field , spin caloritronics@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider normal / ferromagnetic / normal graphene junctions where a gate electrode is attached to the ferromagnetic graphene ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]-a ) .",
    "we study the combination of charge , heat and spin transport in graphene in the context of spin caloritronics and spin - dependent thermoelectric phenomena .",
    "we have found with an accurate tuning external parameter , namely the exchange filed ( @xmath5 ) and gate voltage ( u ) , the temperature gradient across the junction drives a pure spin current without accompanying the charge current .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1]-(b ) and ( c ) , we show schematically two possible situations , namely @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "depends on the gate voltage magnitude ( throughout the present work , we choose @xmath8 ) , the fermi energy level ( both degenerate up and down spin subbands ) shifts away from the neutrality point to the conduction band .",
    "so the competition between exchange filed and gate voltage plays an important role , in which tuning the exchange filed shifts the two up and down spin subbands in different ways and two possible situations are predicted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ( ii ) , we summarize the model , hamiltonian and formalism . in section ( iii )",
    ", we present our numerical results .",
    "finally , conclusion is given in section iv .",
    "the fermions around fermi level in graphene can be defined by a massless relativistic dirac equation .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath9 with the pauli matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the velocity @xmath12 in graphene .",
    "the pauli matrices act on the two sublattice of the honeycomb structure .",
    "the @xmath13 sign refers to the two valleys of k and @xmath0 points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "moreover , the valley degeneracy permits one to consider one of the @xmath14 set .",
    "a two dimensional normal / ferromagnetic / normal graphene junction is considered where an external transverse electric field is applied to a part of graphene sheet to make it ferromagnetic partially@xcite . using the first - principles calculations authors in ref.[@xcite ] has shown that an applied in - plane homogeneous electric fields across the graphene nanoribbons , can induce half - metallic properties .",
    "besides the applied electric field , recently it has been shown that placing graphene on an insulating ferromagnetic substrate made of yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) can make the graphene ferromagnetic while leaving its electronic properties unchanged@xcite .",
    "a gate electrode is also attached to the ferromagnetic graphene .",
    "the interfaces are parallel to the y - axis and located at @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig1]-a ) .",
    "since there is a valley degeneracy , one can focus on the hamiltionian @xmath17 with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 in the normal graphenes and @xmath20 in the ferromagnetic graphene . here",
    ", @xmath21 is the fermi energy , @xmath22 is the chemical potential shift tunable by the gate voltage , and @xmath5 is the exchange field . @xmath23 signs correspond to majority and minority spins .",
    "the spin dependent band then follows as @xmath24 .",
    "the wave - functions are given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 where @xmath27 demonstrates the wave - function in the left ( right ) normal graphene while @xmath28 is the wave - function in the ferromagnetic graphene , with angles of incidence @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath54 are calculated as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the charge and spin figures of merit for a magnetic system can be defined versus seebeck coefficients as below , @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes charge(spin ) conductivity with @xmath59 and the thermal conductivity is given by @xmath60 .",
    "we concentrate in low enough temperatures where only electrons contribute effectively in thermal transport and at this regime spin dependent @xmath61 reads by definition , @xmath62 in this work , we will not consider the phonon contribution in the thermal conductivity .",
    "the main contribution of @xmath63 would lead to a smaller figures of merit because it enhances the denominator of @xmath64 .",
    "so the charge and spin thermopower will not be affected with the presence of phonon .",
    "furthermore , it has been reported that at low temperature the thermal conductivity of phonon decreases with temperature in a power - law fashion @xmath65 , while the thermal conductivity of electrons shows a linear behavior @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "moreover , in ref.[@xcite ] , has been shown that the thermal conductivity of phonon decreases with length .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the temperature dependent have been reported for graphene with @xmath67 which is at least ten times bigger than what we consider in this work .",
    "so at low temperature ( @xmath68 ) and with length ( @xmath69 ) the thermal conductivity of electrons has a dominant contribution than the thermal conductivity of phonon .",
    "we present the numerical results for both linear and nonlinear regimes separately .",
    "when @xmath70 ( @xmath71 are the temperatures of the left and right electrode , respectively ) the system acts within the linear in temperature regime . in this regime ,",
    "the thermopower characterizes the efficiency of energy conversion along with the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath64 .",
    "while the temperature differential between electrodes enhances , the system may shift to nonlinear regime of action .",
    "for example , a thermovoltage that nonlinearly alter with @xmath72 was reported experimentally and theoretically on semiconductor quantum dots and single - molecule junctions@xcite .",
    "we focus on the charge and spin seebeck coefficients @xmath73 and their corresponding figures of merit @xmath74 and@xmath75 .",
    "it is widely known that electron - hole asymmetry near the fermi level in the band structure or transport properties controls the thermoelectric effects .",
    "so one envisages that manipulating such asymmetry would be applicable to find such a eminent thermoelectric effect in graphene junction . in the following ,",
    "we first address the linear regime .      in the calculations ,",
    "all energy scaled with the fermi energy @xmath76 and we set it as the unit of energy .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the charge and spin thermopower ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively ) and corresponding figures of merit ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively ) as functions of scaled exchange field @xmath77 for different scaled temperature @xmath45 .",
    "we have set dimensionless gate voltage @xmath47 , in which the fermi level lies in the conduction band .",
    "as it can bee seen , at low temperature limit , here we mean @xmath78 and @xmath79 , both charge and spin thermopowers present an oscillation trend as a function of exchange field . at zero exchange field , both @xmath80 and @xmath81 have an equal and negative contribution , so one expects a zero spin seebeck coefficient @xmath82 , which is clear from the result depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2]-(b ) .",
    "the total negative charge seebeck coefficient @xmath83 is owing to a charge accumulation gradient in the opposite direction of moving electrons in the conduction band with both up and down spins along the temperature gradient .     for different values of dimensionless temperature @xmath45 . here",
    "we set @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath46 and the seebeck coefficients are measured in units of ( @xmath48 ) . ]     for different values of dimensionless temperature @xmath45 . here",
    "we set @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath49 and the seebeck coefficients are measured in units of ( @xmath48 ) . ]    for all temperatures and exchange filed considered here , except in the region @xmath86 at low temperature , both charge and spin seebeck coefficients are negative .",
    "it signals that even in the presence of the exchange filed the majority spin carries , here down spin , from the conductance band dominates . for the middle region @xmath87 at low temperature ,",
    "the situation is reversed and the contribution of minority spin carriers from the valence band dominates . in this region the exchange field shifts the up spin subband s fermi level to the valence band and cause the holes from spin down subband to be thermally activated .",
    "these excitations transfer positive charge current and so , has positive sign contribution to the charge seebeck while the moved spin up electrons to the conduction band yet have a negative contribution .",
    "it is also worth noting that at high temperatures , the spin seebeck coefficient is negative for all exchange fields , while its charge counterpart still shows a changing sign . which it can be regarded as a pure spin current caused by temperature gradient .      +      to get more insight , in fig .  [ fig3 ]",
    "we consider the effect of a different length .",
    "so as the previous case , here we have repeated our calculation with @xmath49 .",
    "the other parameters are same as the fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "compare with the previous case , @xmath46 , the profound effects are visible at low temperatures .",
    "interestingly , both the charge and spin thermopower show an odd feature respect to the exchange field @xmath88 which reaches the maxima on one side of the symmetric point @xmath89 and the minima on the other side .",
    "the corresponding figure of merits also shows an enhancement about the symmetric point @xmath85 which is profound at the low temperature limit . in current experimental situation ,",
    "it is feasible to find such a tunability of length in order to reach such enhancement in the power output of the thermoelectrical devices .    fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the charge and spin thermopowers and corresponding figures of merit as functions of scaled chemical potential @xmath90 for different values of dimensionless temperature @xmath45 with length @xmath46 .",
    "the charge seebeck coefficient shows an odd function of @xmath90 in which reaches the maxima on one side of the symmetric point @xmath91 and the minima on the other side .",
    "while the spin seebeck coefficient is an even function of @xmath90 and can reach a minimum at @xmath91 , where the charge seebeck coefficient is zero , so it can be feasible to obtain a pure spin thermopower .",
    "the physics behind the generation of a pure spin thermopower backs to symmetrical shifts of different spin up and down subband about @xmath91 , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]-c ) , in which @xmath92 .",
    "it is worth to mention that from the symmetry of spin - dependent band energy @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 which leads to @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the large spin seebeck coefficient is observed in the intermediate temperature , which even can exceed its charge counterpart in magnitude .",
    "effects of different length are also addressed in fig .",
    "it is clear , by comparing cases with lengths @xmath46 and @xmath49 , much more effect occurs at low temperature limit in which the pure spin thermopower finds a big reduction at the symmetric point @xmath91 , meanwhile gets a big enhancement with sign changing about @xmath97 .",
    "a careful inspection reveals that at these two points @xmath98 , both @xmath99 and @xmath100 are zero , which can be achieved when @xmath101 .",
    "it is also worth noticing that at these points the spin figure of merit @xmath102 finds magnitude more than @xmath103 .    before closing the linear regime behavior and in order to have a comprehensive discussion , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we have depicted a density plot of the charge and spin thermopower versus dimensionless exchange field @xmath77 and temperature @xmath45 . as is can be seen , the major effects happen in the low temperature regime . in case with @xmath49",
    "( see two top panels ) , at very low temperature @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) shows a sharp sign change from negative ( positive ) to positive ( negative ) at @xmath89 . increasing temperature shifts this point to higher and lower magnitude of the exchange field for the charge and spin thermopowers , respectively .",
    "the white color line in the figures is signaling zero thermopower which one can see with fine - tunability of background temperature , and exchange filed it would be feasible to find a large pure spin thermopower without accompanying charge ones .",
    "for @xmath46 case ( see two bottom panels ) , the situation is less regular and at very low temperature one can see two times which @xmath99 and @xmath100 change their sign .",
    "it is interesting that contrast to the case with @xmath49 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 show the same sign at very low temperature . while by increasing temperature the situation gets more complex for the charge thermopower with zero magnitude which spin thermopower finds big negative value .",
    "now we turn to the nonlinear regime .",
    "the thermovoltage can be determined from open - circuit condition .",
    "then , we define charge and spin thermovoltages which can be obtained as @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . solving this equation",
    ", we find the charge @xmath106 and spin @xmath107 thermovoltages .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "however , before going through the results of thermovoltages , it would be instructive to analysis the possible thermally activated current ( thermocurrent ) in the structure .",
    "the charge and spin currents are defined as @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is biased voltage applied across the junction which we put zero @xmath111 in our calculations to take consider just thermally excited flow of charge carriers .",
    "we depict our numerical results for some parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . with increasing @xmath112 , for case with @xmath46 ( see right column )",
    "both charge and spin currents magnitude increase in a nonlinear fashion . in case with @xmath113",
    "( see left column ) situation is different . depends on the exchange field magnitude , shifts the up and down spin subbands on conduction and valance bands or leave them on the conduction band , charge and spin currents show a minimum value at intermediate @xmath112 .",
    "further increase of the temperature difference reduces the current magnitude and reach zero .",
    "subsequent growth of the temperature difference leads to emergence of current with the reversed polarity .    having the current , here thermocurrent",
    ", one can find the thermovoltage with solving @xmath114 .",
    "results for case in which the exchange filed is grater than the gate voltage @xmath115 are plotted in fig .",
    "as it can be seen , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are showing an opposite response to the temperature difference in such a way that with increasing @xmath72 , charge(spin ) thermovoltage increases and reaches maximum(minimum ) .",
    "further increase of the @xmath72 reduces thermovoltages till reach zero magnitude @xmath116 at a certain value of temperature difference @xmath72 .",
    "subsequent growth of the @xmath72 leads to emergence of the thermovoltages with the reversed polarity .",
    "the thermovoltage reversal polarity would be explained as follows .",
    "let s assume that chemical potentials of the electrodes in the unbiased system @xmath117 , and the charge carriers are electrons , temperature difference in across the junction leads to the flow of electrons from the left ( hot ) to the right ( cool ) electrode . to suppress this thermally induced current , a negative thermovoltage establishes which grows in magnitude as @xmath72 increases .",
    "meanwhile , as the @xmath72 rises , the fermi distribution function shape of the left ( hot ) electrode is getting partially smoothed out .",
    "this opens the way for holes to flow to the right(cool ) electrode . at a certain value of temperature differential the hole flux",
    "completely compensates the electron flux .",
    "so , at this value of temperature difference , the thermally induced electric current disappears at @xmath118 . as it can be seen , for shorter junction the point which thermovoltage find zero magnitude , shifts to higher temperature difference .",
    "for a set of parameters which indicated in each panel . in all cases",
    "we fixed the dimensionless gate voltage as @xmath47 .",
    "right and left columns correspond to the @xmath49 and @xmath46 cases . ]    .",
    "we fixed the dimensionless gate voltage and exchange field as @xmath47 and @xmath119 , respectively . ]    before concluding , we comment on the realization of our funding . setting @xmath120 and considering @xmath46 and @xmath49 ,",
    "needs a ferromagnetic junction with lengths around @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "in which both lengths are smaller than the spin relaxation length and feasible in present experimental devices@xcite . the exchange field and chemical potential are tunable by in - plane external magnetic field@xcite and external gate @xcite , respectively .",
    "based on our choose @xmath120 , the values of @xmath22 and @xmath5 in the range of @xmath123 is required which is accessible by the current experimental apparatus .",
    "in summary , using wave function matching approach and employing the landauer - buttiker formula a ferromagnetic graphene junction with temperature gradient across the system , is studied .",
    "we calculate the thermally excited charge and spin current as well as the thermoelectric voltage ( seebeck effect ) .",
    "we have found the system under consideration is sensitive to temperature and system length .",
    "different lengths considered ( namely @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) here , are studied in ballistic ( quantum ) regime and a profound effects are obtained .",
    "albeit , it seems for length @xmath125 , the diffusion processes should be taken into account .",
    "so much work is required to study the system behavior in the crossing from the diffusive regime to the quantum regime .",
    "but , as long as the phonon contribution is not important in the seebeck effect , we do not expect a profound effect will emerge .    our calculation also revealed that owing to the electron - hole symmetry the charge seebeck coefficient is , for an undoped magnetic graphene , an odd function of chemical potential while the spin seebeck coefficient is an even function regardless of the temperature gradient and junction length .",
    "another important characteristic of thermoelectric transport , thermally excited current in the nonlinear regime , is examined .",
    "it would be our main finding that with increasing thermal gradient applied to the junction the spin and charge thermovoltages decrease and even become zero for non zeros temperature bias .",
    "we have also found with an accurate tuning external parameter , namely the exchange filed and gate voltage , the temperature gradient across the junction drives a pure spin current without accompanying the charge current .",

    "<S> using wave function matching approach and employing the landauer - buttiker formula a ferromagnetic graphene junction with temperature gradient across the system , is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the thermally induced charge and spin current as well as the thermoelectric voltage ( seebeck effect ) in the linear and nonlinear regimes . our calculation revealed that owing to the electron - hole symmetry , the charge seebeck coefficient is , for an undoped magnetic graphene , an odd function of chemical potential while the spin seebeck coefficient is an even function regardless of the temperature gradient and junction length . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found with an accurate tuning external parameter , namely the exchange filed and gate voltage , the temperature gradient across the junction drives a pure spin current without accompanying the charge current . </S>",
    "<S> another important characteristic of thermoelectric transport , thermally induced current in the nonlinear regime , is examined . </S>",
    "<S> it would be our main finding that with increasing thermal gradient applied to the junction the spin and charge thermovoltages decrease and even become zero for non zero temperature bias . </S>"
