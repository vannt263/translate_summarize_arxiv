    "triply excited states of atomic lithium represent the prototypical case of a highly correlated , multi - excited three - electron system in the presence of a nucleus , and thus typify the four - body coulombic problem .",
    "since all the three electrons reside in higher shells leaving the k shell empty , these are often referred to as the _ hollow _ states .",
    "as the one - step photogeneration of such a state requires coherent excitation of all the three electrons , these are usually more difficult to produce from the ground state by single photon absorption or electron impact excitation .",
    "these , in addition to their proximity to more than one thresholds coupled with the presence of an infinite number of open channels associated with these resonances , have offered considerable challenges to both experimentalists as well as theoreticians .    the recent advances in third - generation ,",
    "extreme - uv synchrotron radiation sources as well as the availability of sophisticated and powerful quantum mechanical methodologies have stimulated an overwhelming amount of works in the last decade that shed significant light on the understanding of such systems with greater accuracy .",
    "ever since the first observation of @xmath8 states of li in a beam - foil experiment [ 1 ] , numerous attempts [ 2 - 4 ] have been made over the years to use this technique which identified bound states such as the 2p@xmath9 @xmath6s@xmath5 besides many autoionizing states .",
    "later , photoabsorption spectroscopy [ 5 ] using a dual laser plasma technique reported measurement of the lowest 2s@xmath32p @xmath3p@xmath5 resonance in li .",
    "subsequently a large number of higher resonances were found and tentatively classified in a wider energy range ( 140165 ev ) [ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "first high - precision photoelectron spectroscopic determination [ 9 ] of the partial photoionization cross sections generated tremendous interest to measure the resonance positions , widths of both even- and odd - parity hollow states having varied symmetries [ 10 - 14 ] with better resolution over wider energy regions .",
    "some rydberg series [ 15 ] as well as the states with both k and l shell vacancies [ 8,13 ] have also been identified lately .",
    "parallel to the experimental progresses , a substantial amount of theoretical works have also been done over the years for reliable , accurate prediction of energies , widths and lifetimes of these multi - excited states , varying in their complexity and accuracy .",
    "one of the earliest such calculations for li - isoelectronic series was due to [ 16 ] employing a truncated diagonalization method ( tdm ) , based on the hydrogenic orbitals .",
    "later other formalisms such as the 1/z expansion method [ 17 ] , many - body perturbation theory [ 18 ] were also used to investigate these states .",
    "some other recent theoretical works include the state - specific theory [ 19 - 21 ] , the configuration interaction ( ci ) type approach [ 22 ] , joint saddle point ( sp ) and complex coordinate rotation ( ccr ) method [ 23 - 25 ] , the space partition and stabilization procedure [ 26 ] , a density functional formalism [ 27 ] , several variants of the r - matrix theory [ 28 - 31 ] as well as the tdm [ 32,33 ] , the hyperspherical coordinate approach [ 34,35 ] , etc .",
    "although the most natural and commonest choice in these works was neutral atom ( li ) , other atomic systems such as the negative ions ( e.g. , he@xmath10 ) , positive ions like li - isoelectronic series or n@xmath11 [ 22 ] have also received considerable attention .",
    "while majority of the available formalisms involve traditional wave - function - based calculations requiring large basis sets and often involving mixing of continuum states , a density - based formalism for triply excited states was proposed in [ 27 ] . in this approach",
    "a kohn - sham ( ks ) type differential equation was solved to obtain the self - consistent set of orbitals and densities using the nonvariational local work - function based exchange potential [ 36 ] in conjunction with the nonlinear gradient- and laplacian - included correlation energy functional of lee , yang and parr ( lyp ) [ 37 ] .",
    "fairly good quality results were reported for various closed and open shell many - electron atomic excited states including the single , double , triple as well as low and moderately high excitations ; core and valence states ; bound and autoionizing states besides the satellite states [ 38 - 43,27 ] .",
    "this single - determinantal formalism was able to reproduce the excited state energies , radial densities , various expectation values , excitation energies ( 102000 ev ) as well as the small energy differences ( 0.0323.5 ev ) quite satisfactorily . however , all the above density functional theory ( dft)-based calculations of atomic excited states employed a numerov - type finite difference ( fd ) scheme to numerically solve the ks type equation . recently a generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) approach has been utilized to solve it in a more accurate and efficient manner [ 44 ] , as demonstrated for the singly and doubly excited high - lying rydberg states of he as well as the singly excited states of li and be .",
    "the singly excited state energies were within 0.01% of the best literature data for he ( for other atoms it was less than 0.02% ) , while for the doubly excited states of he it was well within 3.6% .",
    "the discrepancy in the calculated single and double excitation energies for 31 selected states were within 0.0090.632% and 0.0851.600% respectively .",
    "the gps method has been shown to be a very powerful tool for accurate and physically meaningful results of both static and dynamic properties of coulombic singular systems such as atoms and molecules as well as other stronger singularities like the generalized spiked harmonic oscillators [ 44 - 48 ] . while in [ 27 ]",
    ", results were presented for all the eight n=2 intrashell triply excited states of li isoelectronic series ( z=2,3,4,6,8,10 ) with reasonable accuracy , resonance series including the higher members were not considered and to the best of our knowledge , no other dft - based attempts are known so far for these systems .",
    "the purpose of this work is therefore to explore and extend the regions of validity of the density - based approach to these challenging hollow states and also to study the spectra of these resonances in a detailed and elaborate way .",
    "we thus focus on the energies and the excitation energies of twelve @xmath0n@xmath1 ( n@xmath22 ) odd- and even - parity doublet and quartet resonance series of li leading nearly to 270 states ( 2s@xmath3ns @xmath3s@xmath4 , 2s@xmath3np @xmath3p@xmath5 , 2s@xmath3nd @xmath3d@xmath4 , 2p@xmath3ns @xmath3d@xmath4,@xmath6p@xmath4 , 2s2pns @xmath6p@xmath5 , 2s2pnp @xmath6d@xmath4 , 2p@xmath3np @xmath3f@xmath5 , @xmath6d@xmath5 , 2p@xmath3nd @xmath3g@xmath4 , @xmath6f@xmath4 , 2s2pnd @xmath6f@xmath5 ) , up to a maximum of n=25 . as a further test , additional results",
    "are also reported for 37 @xmath7n@xmath1 ( n@xmath23 ) doubly hollow states of li having vacancies in both the k and l shells up to n=6 , out of which seven are n=3 intrashell type .",
    "comparisons are made with the experimental and other theoretical results , wherever possible .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section ii presents a brief summary of the methodology as well as the computational aspects .",
    "section iii makes a detailed discussion on the obtained results and a few conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "since the work - function formalism for atomic excited states [ 38 - 43,27 ] as well as its gps implementation [ 44 ] has been discussed in detail previously , here we give only the essential steps in the calculation ( atomic units employed throughout the article , unless otherwise mentioned ) .",
    "the local exchange potential with which the electrons move is interpreted [ 36,49 ] physically as the work done to move an electron from infinity to its position @xmath12 against the electric field @xmath13 arising out of the fermi - hole charge distribution , @xmath14 , and as such is given by the following line integral , @xmath15 this field @xmath13 , being representative of the pauli correlation , as its quantum mechanical source charge distribution is the pair correlation density , has the following form , @xmath16 this work against @xmath13 can be determined exactly as the fermi hole is known explicitly in terms of the single - particle orbitals , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the single - particle density matrix spherically averaged over coordinates of the electrons of a given orbital angular momentum quantum number .",
    "now within the central - field approximation , the orbitals expressed as @xmath19 ( @xmath20 denoting the usual spherical harmonics ) , give the total electron density as the sum of the occupied orbitals , @xmath21 and the spherically averaged radial component of the electric field is simplified as , @xmath22 now assuming that a unique local exchange potential exists for a given excited state , the following ks - type equation is solved , @xmath23 \\phi_i({\\mathrm{\\mathbf{r } } } ) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathit{i } } \\phi_{\\mathit{i}}({\\mathrm{\\mathbf{r}}}),\\ ] ] to obtain the self - consistent set of orbitals @xmath24 and the electron density .",

    "there are several prescriptions available in the literature and the present work uses the widely used lyp functional [ 37 ] .",
    "now we present a brief overview of the computational procedure used to solve the pertinent ks equation through the gps formalism .",
    "one disquieting feature of the commonly used equal - spacing fd methods is that because of the existence of coulomb singularity at the origin as well as the long range nature of the coulomb potential , one requires a large number of grid points to achieve reasonably good accuracy even for the ground states .",
    "however the gps method allows nonuniform and optimal spatial discretization maintaining similar accuracy at both small and large @xmath31 regions . thus one can work with a much lesser grid points having a denser mesh at small @xmath31 while a coarser mesh at large @xmath31 .",
    "moreover it also has the attractive feature of possessing both the simplicity of direct fd or finite element methods and the fast convergence of the finite basis set methods .",
    "one of the principal features of this scheme lies in the fact that a function @xmath32 defined in the interval @xmath33 $ ] can be approximated by the polynomial @xmath34 of order n so that , @xmath35 and the approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _ @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 here we employ the legendre pseudospectral method using @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are obtainable from the roots of the first derivative of the legendre polynomial @xmath41 with respect to @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 the cardinal functions , @xmath44 in eq .",

    "( 1 ) and the lyp correlation functional [ 37 ] , ks equation ( 6 ) is solved numerically in a self - consistent manner to obtain the orbitals .",
    "these are then employed to construct the various slater determinants derived from a particular electronic configuration . in general , denoting the electronic energies of determinants and multiplets associated with a given electronic configuration by @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , the slater s diagonal sum rule [ 52,38 - 44,27 ] is used to calculate the @xmath58 as , @xmath59 for all the calculations reported in this work , a consistent convergence criteria of @xmath60 and @xmath61 a.u . , are used for the potential and energy respectively , whereas a maximum of 500 radial grid points sufficed to achieve convergence .",
    "the calculated nonrelativistic term and excitation energies for various hollow states of li along with the available experimental and theoretical results are given in tables i through vii . in the literature , usually the excitation energies are reported , while the individual state energies are given in only few occasions . in a recent study of the low - lying singly excited states of several open - shell atoms ( b , c , o , f , na , mg , al ,",
    "si , p and cl ) within the work - function formalism [ 42 ] , it was observed that the excitation energies from the exchange - only and the numerical hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations showed good agreement with each other .",
    "interestingly however , the two correlation energy functionals ( relatively simpler local wigner and the nonlocal lyp ) did not show any considerable improvements in excitation energies , although the excited - state energies were improved significantly .",
    "therefore we decided to present both these quantities for all the states considered in this work .",
    "the state energies are given in atomic units , while the excitation energies in ev ( 1 a.u.=27.2076544 ev ) are given relative to the accurate ground state of li calculated from a full core plus correlation using the multiconfiguration interaction wave function , i.e. , @xmath62 a.u .",

    "the experimental results for @xmath3s@xmath4 resonances are yet to be obtained .",
    "the lower members of the series have been treated theoretically in considerable detail by several workers employing a multitude of techniques , e.g. , the n=3 state by a hyperspherical coordinate method [ 35 ] , the n=3,4 resonances by a combination of sp and ccr method [ 25 ] .",
    "the n=39 resonances were also calculated by the r - matrix method including a set of core base states for the li@xmath64 target along with an optimization of the collisional representation [ 28 ] .",
    "recently , an eigenphase derivative technique in conjunction with a quantum defect theory [ 31 ] reported the low and high resonances up to n=22 , whereas the same up to n=12 have been studied through the tdm [ 33 ] .",
    "the agreement of the present density functional results for both the quantities are seen to be fairly good ; the current state energies lie about 0.360.88% above the tdm results [ 33 ] , whereas the excitation energies are higher by 0.410.51% from those of [ 31 ] .",
    "it is noted that the small differences in excitation energies are reproduced quite nicely within the whole series ; a feature which holds true for all the resonance series dealt in this work .",
    "coming to the @xmath3p@xmath5 states , these are the most widely studied hollow resonance series in li , both experimentally and theoretically , chiefly due to the fact that the lowest n=2 intrashell li state is the 2s@xmath32p @xmath3p@xmath5 .",
    "photoion yield spectroscopic measurements determined its position at 142.33 ev [ 7 ] and 142.35 ev [ 6 ] respectively , which has been supported by various theoretical calculations , e.g. , the combined sp ccr method [ 23 ] , the complex scaling method having correlated basis functions constructed from b - splines [ 53 ] , the r - matrix method [ 28 ] , as well as the tdm method [ 33 ] .",

    "although founded in the 1920s and later rejuvenated in the 1960s in the works of hohenberg , kohn and sham [ 58,59 ] , dft has been a very powerful and successful tool for the electronic structure calculation of atoms , molecules , solids in their ground states [ 60,61 ] , inherent difficulties were encountered for the excited states and consequently in areas such as spectroscopy , its success has been relatively less conspicuous .",
    "the well - known fundamental problems such as the lack of a unique exact formal relationship valid for general excited states parallel to the ks method for ground states , as well as the unavailability of hitherto unfound universal xc energy density functional etc . , have been well documented in the literature in considerable length ( see , for example , [ 43 ] for a review ) . nevertheless , numerous attractive and elegant formalisms have been suggested by many authors over the years ; e.g. , the subspace formulation of dft [ 62 ] and its application to atomic excited states [ 63 ] , ensemble formalism for the unequally weighted states using a rayleigh - ritz variational principle [ 64 ] , a perturbative treatment [ 65,66 ] , calculation of multiplet energies within the hartree - fock - slater method utilizing the spin - polarized form of the density matrix and exploiting slater s sum rule [ 52,67,68 ] , ensemble approach using several appropriate functionals [ 69,70 ] , the time - dependent ( td ) dft formulation [ 71 - 73 ] making use of the td df response theory , etc .",
    "recently correlation energies of several atomic excited states were calculated using the mcscf wave functions [ 74 ] .",
    "while some of these methods offer good quality results , others produce large errors and yet others are computationally difficult to implement . moreover most of these methods have dealt with the lower and singly excited states ; multiple and higher excitations , especially the rydberg series such as the ones studied in this work , have not been reported so far using any other dft approach except the work - function formalism . besides , while some of these methods , such as tddft , provides a way to obtain excitation energies in an efficient and accurate manner ( calculates the linear response of the system to a td perturbation , leading to frequency dependent dynamic dipole polarizability , whose poles and residues yield the excitation energies and oscillator strengths respectively ) , the extraction of individual state energies as well as the densities , are not straightforward . in the present method however ,",
    "the energies , excitation energies as well the densities and expectation values are obtained easily with reasonable accuracy . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first report of triply excited rydberg resonances of many - electron systems within a dft - based formalism .",
    "we also note that the spin polarized version of the work - function exchange potential can be obtained as a further approximation to the accurate spin polarized x - only ks potential ( obtained from a consideration of the optimized effective potential method ) [ 75 ] .",
    "various interesting features of the method may be found in the references [ 27,38 - 44 ] .",
    "twelve triply excited @xmath0n@xmath1 hollow rydberg series of li ( covering a total of about 270 states ) have been studied using a density functional approach .",
    "nonrelativistic term energies , excitation energies and radial densities are reported for both low as well as higher members ( up to n=25 ) of these odd- and even - parity resonances .",
    "the gps solution of the ks type equation yields results in fairly good agreement with the existing literature data .",
    "additionally 37 @xmath7n@xmath1 hollow states are also presented in the photon energy range 175.63180.51 ev , out of which only two ( 3s@xmath33p @xmath3p@xmath5 and 3s3p@xmath3 @xmath6p@xmath4 ) have been reported so far in the literature .",
    "the resonance series interact with each other resulting in very complicated behavior in their positions .",
    "many new resonances are reported here for the first time .",
    "the combination of work - function exchange and the lyp correlation functional within an essentially single determinantal framework offers results quite comparable in accuracy with those from other sophisticated and elaborate quantum mechanical methods .",
    "the exchange - only results are practically of hf - quality ; a feature of the work - function formalism observed in a number of physical systems including atoms , ions , metals , etc .",
    ", ( see , for example [ 76,77 ] ) . consequently , since these are strongly correlated systems , one of the main sources of error in this calculation could be due to the inefficiency of the lyp functional to incorporate the subtle and intricate correlation effects , which may be either improved or replaced by more accurate density functionals .",
    "however , this may not be misconstrued as a drawback of the methodology ; in fact the results are rather quite encouraging , especially in the light of dft s apparent weaknesses and lack of any density - based attempts as yet for these rydberg series .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry in calculating the exchange potential , might be the another possible cause of inaccuracy .",
    "thus the rotational component of the electric field may not have negligible contribution compared to the irrotational component for these states , although for atoms this usually holds true [ 49 ] .",
    "the extension of this prescription to even higher photon - energy hollow states such as the case where all three electrons remain in shells with n@xmath704 , i.e. , the klm vacancy states etc .",
    ", are straightforward , as well as its application to positive and negative ionic systems and extension to the relativistic domain",
    ". it may also be interesting to employ some of the other dft - based approaches to treat these and other similar systems , so that the nature of the intricate electron correlation may be understood better .",
