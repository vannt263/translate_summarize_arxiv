    "planets are believed to form from micrometer - sized dust grains that grow by collisional sticking in protoplanetary gas discs ( @xcite , see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) . once the bodies reach a size of around one kilometer , the growth to moon - sized protoplanets and later real planets",
    "is achieved by gravitationally induced collisions @xcite .",
    "although significant progress has been made in the understanding of the initial conditions of grain growth @xcite , we nevertheless do not yet have a complete picture of how the solids grow 27 orders of magnitude in mass to form kilometer - sized planetesimals .",
    "growth by coagulation can take place when there is a relative speed between the solids .",
    "various physical effects induce relative speeds at different grain size scales .",
    "this allows for a definition of distinct steps in the growth from micrometer dust grains to meter - sized boulders in a turbulent protoplanetary disc .",
    "microscopic dust grains gain their relative speed due to brownian motion .",
    "this process forms relatively compact cluster - cluster aggregates @xcite .",
    "the speed of the brownian motion falls rapidly with increasing grain mass , and so the time - scale for building up larger compact bodies this way becomes prohibitively large , compared to the life - time of a protoplanetary disc .",
    "when brownian motion is no longer important , the relative speed is dominated by the differential vertical settling in the disc",
    ". the vertical component of the central star s gravity causes the gas to be stratified .",
    "dust grains do not feel the pressure gradient of the gas and thus continue to fall towards the mid - plane with a velocity given by the balance between vertical gravity and the drag force .",
    "larger grains fall faster than smaller grains due to the size - dependent coupling to the gas ( actually bodies that are so massive that they are starting to decouple from the gas will rather move on inclined orbits relative to the disc , i.e.  perform damped oscillations around the mid - plane ) . as they fall , they are thus able to sweep up smaller grains in a process that is qualitatively similar to rainfall in the earth s atmosphere . upon arrival at the mid - plane , the largest solids can reach sizes of a few centimeters @xcite .",
    "these bodies have grown as compact particle - cluster aggregates with a high porosity .",
    "turbulent gas motions cause the sedimented solids to diffuse away from the mid - plane @xcite , where they can meet and collide with a reservoir of microscopic grains .",
    "these tiny grains still hover above the mid - plane because their sedimentation time - scale is so long that turbulent diffusion can keep them well - mixed with the gas over a large vertical extent .",
    "turbulence also plays a role for equal - sized macroscopic bodies by inducing a relative collision speed that is much larger than the brownian motion contribution @xcite .    when estimating the outcome of an interaction between macroscopic bodies , the issues of collision physics must be taken into account . for relative speeds above a certain threshold , the bodies are likely to break up when they collide rather than to stick @xcite .",
    "this is a problem for macroscopic bodies where the sticking threshold is a few meters per second .",
    "fragmentation caused by high - speed encounters continuously replenish the reservoir of microscopic dust grains .",
    "these can then be swept up by the boulders that are lucky enough to avoid critical encounters .",
    "however , the sweeping up of smaller dust grains by a macroscopic body has its limitations when the relative speed exceeds some 10 meter per second @xcite . at larger relative velocities of up to a hundred meters per second , which are likely to occur due to the high speed of larger bodies",
    ", the small grains will erode the boulder .",
    "the time evolution of the size - distribution of solids can be calculated by solving the coagulation equation numerically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite performed numerical simulations of the coagulation for realistic disc environments .",
    "starting with micrometer - sized grains only , they find that a narrow peak of 0.110 meter - sized boulders can form in @xmath1@xmath2 years , when fragmentation is ignored . on the other hand , in a more realistic situation",
    "high speed impacts lead to fragmentation . here",
    "@xcite find that once the size distribution reaches the meter regime , still around @xmath3 of the mass is maintained in microscopic bodies , which are the fragments of larger bodies that have been destroyed in collisions .",
    "this picture is given some credit by the fact that microscopic dust grains are observed in protoplanetary discs of millions of years of age , whereas the time - scale for depleting grains of those sizes is only around 1,000 years in the absence of fragmentation .",
    "besides the problem of getting macroscopic bodies to stick , meter - sized boulders quickly drift radially inward toward the central star due to their aerodynamic friction with the gas in a typical sub - keplerian disc @xcite",
    ". the drift time - scale can be as short as 100 years . to avoid evaporation in the inner disc or in the central star",
    ", the bodies must grow by least an order of magnitude in size ( three orders of magnitude in mass ) in a time shorter than this !    a possibility to overcome the growth obstacles",
    "was suggested independently by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the general idea is that boulders sediment towards the mid - plane and form a particle sublayer that undergoes a gravitational instability , forming the planetesimals in a spontaneous event ( _ gelation _ ) rather than by continuous growth ( _ coagulation _ ) .",
    "the weakest point in this model is that it requires a laminar disc in order to work .",
    "even a tiny amount of turbulence in the disc will prevent the boulders from an efficient sedimentation towards the mid - plane , and the instability will never occur @xcite .",
    "thus disc turbulence had always to be avoided in order to allow for self - gravity assisted planetesimal formation .",
    "however , even in a completely laminar disc , the settled dust induces a vertical shear in the gas rotation profile @xcite .",
    "this can be unstable to a kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "the subsequent kelvin - helmholtz turbulence puffs up the dust layer so that the densities needed for a gravitational instability are usually not achieved , unless a dust - to - gas ratio many times higher than the solar composition is adopted @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , solids can reach sizes of around one meter without the help of self - gravity . in this size regime",
    "the gradual decoupling from the gas motion enables the bodies to move independently from the gas .",
    "this can cause them to be trapped in turbulent features of the gas flow .",
    "an important theoretical discovery is that meter - sized boulders are concentrated in gaseous anticyclonic vortices @xcite .",
    "inside such vortices the dust density can locally be enhanced to values sufficient either for enhanced coagulation or even for gravitational fragmentation .",
    "also the radial drift of particles trapped in the vortices is significantly reduced @xcite .",
    "theoretical attention has furthermore been given to the trapping of dust grains in high pressure regions . since dust grains",
    "do not feel pressure forces , any pressure - supported gas structure must cause dust grains to move in the direction of the pressure gradient @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated that this can lead to large concentrations ( a density increase of up to a factor 50 ) of meter - sized boulders in the high density spiral arms of self - gravitating discs .",
    "the same mechanism can drain millimeter - sized dust grains from the underdense regions around a protoplanet that is not massive enough to open a gap in the gaseous component of the disc @xcite .",

    "magnetorotational turbulence ( mri ) on the other hand is expected to occur in all discs where the ionization fraction is sufficiently high @xcite .",
    "a search for dust concentrations in magnetorotational turbulence was done by @xcite who found no apparent concentrations . on the other hand , recently @xcite ( 2005 , hereafter referred to as jk05 ) found evidence for centimeter - sized dust grains being trapped in short - lived turbulent eddies present in magnetorotational turbulence . that work was ,",
    "however , limited by the fluid description of dust grains , i.e.  the friction time must be much shorter than the orbital period , and could not handle grains larger than a few centimeters .    in this paper , we expand the work done in jk05 by putting meter - sized dust particles , represented by real particles rather than by a fluid , into magnetorotational turbulence .",
    "we show that magnetorotational turbulence @xcite is not actually an obstacle to the self gravity - aided formation of planetesimals , but rather can be a vital agent to produce locally gravitational unstable regions in the solid component of the disc when the average density in solids would not allow for fragmentation .",
    "this process is very similar to the gravoturbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds into protostellar cores @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of treating meter - sized dust boulders we have adapted the pencil code to include the treatment of solid bodies as particles with a freely evolving @xmath22-coordinate on top of the grid .",
    "this is necessary because the mean free path of the boulders , with respect to collisions with the gas molecules , is comparable to the scale height of the disc .",
    "thus the dust component can no longer be treated as a fluid , but must be treated as particles each with a freely evolving spatial coordinate @xmath23 and velocity vector @xmath24 . in other words , it is no longer possible to define a unique velocity field at a given point in space for the particles , because they keep a memory of their previous motion .",
    "friction only erases this memory for small grains .",

    "the friction time depends on the solid radius @xmath29 and the solid density @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the molecular viscosity of the gas , @xmath33 is the sound speed and @xmath34 is the gas density .",
    "this expression is valid when the particle speed is much lower than the sound speed @xcite . using the kinetic theory expression for viscosity @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mean free path of the gas molecules",
    ", the friction time can be divided into two regimes : the epstein regime is valid when @xmath37 . here",
    "the mean free path of the gas molecules is longer than the size of the dust grain , so the gas can not form any flow structure around the object .",
    "the friction time is proportional to the solid radius in this regime . in the stokes regime ,",
    "where @xmath38 , a flow field forms around the object .",
    "now the friction time is proportional to solid radius squared , so the object decouples faster from the gas with increasing size . for an isothermal and unstratified disc , one can treat the friction time @xmath28 as a constant .",
    "the distinction between the epstein and the stokes regime is then only important for translating the friction time into a solid radius ( see end of this section ) .",

    "this changes equation ( [ eq : ss_simple ] ) into @xmath88 here the last term on the left - hand - side represents the advection due to the rotation of the disc relative to the center of the box ( which moves on a purely keplerian orbit ) .",
    "the function @xmath89 is defined as @xmath90 when making the same variable transformation in the equation of motion of the dust particles , there is however no global pressure gradient term to balance the extra coriolis force imposed by the sub - keplerian part of the motion , so the result is @xmath91 the modified coriolis force @xmath89 appears again because of the presence of @xmath92 in @xmath93 .",
    "the last term on the right - hand - side reflects the head wind that the dust feels when it moves through the slightly sub - keplerian gas .",
    "the reason that the term appears in the radial component of the equation of motion is that all velocities are measured relative to the rotational velocity of the gas .",

    "it may seem that the term vanishes for @xmath94 .",
    "but this is actually not the case , since the natural timescale of the disc , @xmath95 , also depends on @xmath85 , so that at large radii there is an immense amount of time at hand to let the tiny global pressure gradient force work .",
    "one can quantify this statement by dividing and multiplying by the scale - height @xmath96 in the last term of equation ( [ eq : dvdt_gpr ] ) to obtain the result @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the ratio of the scale height to the orbital radius , a quantity that is below unity for thin discs .",

    "this means that we solve exactly the same equations for the gas as in jk05 , i.e.  without radial pressure stratification .",

    "we expand the model by letting 2,000,000 particles represent the dust grains .",
    "thus the dust component is typically represented by approximately 8 particles per grid cell .",
    "we set the strength of the radial pressure gradient by the parameter @xmath111 .",
    "this would represent e.g.  a disc with a global pressure gradient given by @xmath112 and a scale - height - to - radius ratio of @xmath113 , which is typical for a solar nebula model @xcite .",
    "we consider friction times of @xmath114 .",
    "the translation from friction time into grain size depends on whether the friction force is in the epstein or in the stokes regime , but the two drag laws yield quite similar grain sizes in the transition regime .",

    "[ f : sigma_sigmad ] the column densities of gas @xmath117 and of dust particles @xmath118 at a time of 50.9 orbits for run a. the gas column density varies only by a few percent over the box , since the turbulence is highly subsonic , but a region of moderate overdensity is seen around the middle of the box .",
    "the dust column density is very high in about the same region as the gas overdensity , around a factor of five higher than the average dust column density in the box , so dust particles have moved from the regions that are now underdense into the overdensity structure near the center of the box .",

    "the explanation for this correlation is as follows .",
    "locations of maximal gas density are also local pressure maxima",
    ". such pressure maxima can trap dust grains @xcite as they are locations of keplerian gas motion .",
    "the inner edge of a pressure maximum must move faster than the keplerian speed because the pressure gradient mimics an additional radial gravity . at the outer edge of a radial pressure enhancement the outwards - directed pressure gradient mimics a decreased gravity , and the gas must move slower than the keplerian speed .",
    "dust grains do not feel the pressure gradient and are thus forced to move into the pressure bump . in our simulations",
    "the radial gas overdensities have a typical lifetime at a given radial position on the order of a few orbits .",
    "when the gas overdensity eventually disappears , the particle overdensity is only slowly getting dissolved , and the particles drift and concentrate towards the location of the next gas overdensity .",
    "the gas density structure in the azimuthal and vertical directions does not show a similar density increase , and as expected there is also no significant concentration of particles with respect to these two directions .",

    "[ f : trapping ] . if a significant fraction of the particles end up in such regions , the average drift speed is reduced . for runs",
    "b and c , there is no significant reduction of the drift speed ( see table [ t : simres ] ) , but there the predicted drift speed is also ten times lower than for meter - sized objects . thus the measurement is not as reliable because the random velocity fluctuations of the particles dominate over the radial drift .    due to the periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath82-directions ,",
    "density structures quickly pass the @xmath82-boundaries , by shear advection , and thus possibly have some interference with themselves . to see the effect of the toroidal box size on the radial drift , we have run simulations with a box size of @xmath142 ( run e ) and @xmath18 ( run f ) , keeping the resolution constant by adding the appropriate number of grid points in the @xmath82-direction .",
    "the time evolution of the mean radial drift velocity is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : vpxm_t2 ] .",
    "it is evidently very similar to fig .",
    "[ f : vpxm_vs_time ] , so the toroidal size of the box does not influence the radial drift reduction noticeably .",
    "as seen in table [ t : simres ] , the maximum particle density for runs e and f is quite high at 50 times the average density in the box , but not as high as in run a. however , simulations e and f only ran for 24 and 16 orbits , respectively , because of computational requirements due to the many grid points .    in simulations of the interaction between a planet and a magnetorotationally turbulent disc , @xcite find that the average migration velocity of the planets is not changed by the presence of mri turbulence ( whereas the spread in drift velocity causes some planets to even drift outwards ) . on the other hand , recent simulations by @xcite indicate that the mean migration of planets can indeed change because of turbulence .",
    "the fluctuations in migration speed are however much stronger than the average ( so that hundreds of orbits are needed for a reliable estimate of the average ) .",
    "this is a very different kind of drift behavior than for the boulders in the current work , where the fluctuations in the drift speed are actually much _ smaller _ than the average .",
    "the presence of long - lived attracting regions in the gas may be the reason why boulders react on turbulence in a completely different way than planets do .    diminishing the radial drift for meter - sized objects by roughly one half may not be saving the boulders from their fate of decaying into the star .",
    "one will have to investigate this process by additionally looking at the growth behavior of the boulders which are sweeping up small grains on their way inwards .",
    "this sweeping up is determined by the actual drift speed with respect to the local gas motion .",
    "even if the mean drift speed is above the threshold for effective sticking , there will be phases of much lower radial drift , where growth can occur .",
    "the overdense regions would also greatly increase the rate of destructive encounters between larger bodies , and thus the reservoir of small bodies would be stronger replenished there",
    ". this would not only influence growth of larger bodies , but also possibly have observational consequences .    the present simulations are done in the gentle situation of turbulence in a local box .",
    "global disc simulations have stronger turbulence and larger density fluctuations .",
    "one can predict that it would thus also lead to a larger decrease in radial drift speed .",
    "this would possibly give the meter - sized boulders enough time to grow to a size safe for radial drift .",
    "however , this yet has to be demonstrated in global simulations .",
    "we already showed that turbulence can strongly influence the growth of boulders by slowing them down and by concentrating them locally .",
    "these results can be incorporated into standard evolution codes for the solid material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which try to grow planetesimals from dust grains via coagulation . on the other hand the high local concentration can also lead to a different way of planetesimal formation , i.e.  gelation . in the gelation case",
    "a cloud of boulders is so dense that gravitational attraction becomes important . while we will not study self - gravity by an @xmath143-body approach in this work ( as one should ) , we want at least demonstrate by simple estimations under what conditions the concentration of boulders could clump into planetesimals .",
    "the gravity constant @xmath144 enters in self - gravity calculations , and thus the equations are no longer scale - free , but depend on the adopted disc model .",
    "we characterize a disc model by a column density @xmath145 , an average dust - to - gas mass density ratio @xmath146 ( for boulders of the considered size range ) and a scale - height - to - radius ratio of @xmath99 . of course",
    ", @xmath146 will be smaller than the global dust - to - gas ratio @xmath147 , because only a part of the mass will be present in boulders of the considered size range .",
    "we choose for simplicity the value @xmath148 , assuming that 50% of the total dust mass is in bodies of the considered size , and we shall later discuss in how far this value is reasonable for a protoplanetary disc .",
    "the apparently large number of particles in our numerical simulations is still orders of magnitude away from any real number of boulders in the volume of the protoplanetary disc considered in our simulations .",
    "thus it is necessary and validated to let one superparticle represent an entire swarm of many particles of similar location and velocity in the disc .",
    "superparticle means in this context that one particle has the aerodynamic behavior of a single boulder , but represents a mass of trillions of such bodies as it mimics an entire swarm of protoplanetesimals .",
    "similar assumptions are common in simulations of giant planet core formation from colliding planetesimals @xcite as well as in cosmological @xmath143-body simulations @xcite .",
    "we let the simulation box represent the protoplanetary disc in the mid - plane .",
    "each superparticle then contains the mass @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the volume of the box , @xmath143 is the number of superparticles , and @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the dust - to - gas ratio and the gas density in the mid - plane of the disc .",
    "we shall use the isothermal disc expression @xmath153 to calculate the mass density in the mid - plane .",
    "the expected drift velocity in a laminar disc is indicated with a dashed line .",
    "the measured drift velocity is approximately the same as for the cube simulations , so the periodic @xmath82-boundary is not the reason for the reduced drift speed .",
    "rather it is a side - effect of trapping the particles in radial density enhancements . ]    to calculate the dust - to - gas ratio in the mid - plane , @xmath151 , one needs to take into account the effect of vertical settling of solid material .",
    "solids move in the direction of higher gas pressure . in the case of vertical stratification ,",
    "that means that the boulders must sediment towards the mid - plane .",
    "an equilibrium is reached when the sedimentation is balanced by the turbulent diffusion , with diffusion coefficient @xmath154 @xcite , away from the mid - plane .",
    "this leads to a gaussian profile of the dust - to - gas ratio @xcite ,        @xmath155 \\ , ,    \\label{eq : eps_strat}\\ ] ]    with the dust - to - gas ratio scale height given by the expression @xmath156 .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio at @xmath157 is @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the scale height of the gas .",
    "we now proceed by writing the turbulent diffusion coefficient as @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the turbulent diffusion equivalent of @xmath162 of @xcite .",
    "then the mid - plane dust - to - gas ratio @xmath151 can be written as @xmath163 where the approximate expression is valid for @xmath164 . for @xmath165 and @xmath129 ,",
    "this gives @xmath166 , so starting from a dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath148 , the mid - plane dust - to - gas ratio can be expected to rise to @xmath167 due to vertical settling .",
    "such a low dust - to - gas ratio alone will not for any physically reasonable column density cause gravitational fragmentation @xcite or be subject to vertical stirring by the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( the richardson number @xmath168 is around unity , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and stratification with @xmath169 should be stable ) . even at such a high dust - to - gas ratio we are still in the gas - dominated regime where the back - reaction from the dust on the gas can be neglected .",
    "the turbulent dust concentrations are assumed to occur in such a vertically settled dust layer .",
    "now the most overdense regions will have a dust - to - gas ratio of unity and beyond .",
    "but we have measured that only about 3% of the grid cells have a dust - to - gas ratio of above unity at any given time , and thus it is still reasonable as a first approximation to ignore the back - reaction of the dust on the gas , although a more advanced study should include this effect as well .    to find out",
    "if a given overdense clump is gravitationally unstable , we shall compare the different time - scales and length - scales involved in fragmentation by self - gravity in a jeans - type stability analysis .",
    "first we investigate if the clump is gravitationally bound .",
    "we consider a clump of radius @xmath170 , mass @xmath171 and velocity dispersion @xmath172 .",
    "the velocity dispersion must include the dispersion due to the background shear .",
    "for such a clump with a given mass to be gravitationally unstable , it must have a radius that is smaller than the jeans radius given by @xmath173 if this first criterion is fulfilled , then it is also important that the collapse time - scale of the structure is shorter than the life - time of the overdense clump @xmath174 . only then we can be sure that the changing gas flow will not dissolve the concentration before it has had time to contract significantly .",
    "the fragmentational collapse happens on the free - fall time - scale @xmath175 the condition for gravitational instability is now that @xmath176 and that at the same time @xmath177 .",
    "we do not have to check separately that the collapse happens faster than a shear time @xmath178 , since the effect of the background shear is already included in the velocity dispersion .",
    "we now try to find out the smallest value of @xmath145 that gives rise to a gravitational instability",
    ". then we can see whether this is a value that occurs in nature or not . for @xmath129 ( run a )",
    "the minimum value of the column density turns out to be around @xmath179 ( 6 times the minimum mass solar nebula value at 5 au ) , whereas for @xmath116 ( run c ) , a gravitationally unstable cluster of protoplanetesimals is achieved already at the minimum mass solar nebula value @xmath180 .",
    "first run a is considered . here",
    "we can calculate the mass in each superparticle .",
    "with @xmath181 , @xmath113 , @xmath182 and @xmath167 , we get @xmath183 and @xmath184",
    ". thus each superparticle represents about @xmath185 meter - sized protoplanetesimals .",
    "this is five orders of magnitude more mass than in a kilometer - sized planetesimal , but since we are interested in identifying gravitationally bound regions with the mass of thousands and thousands of planetesimals , this is not a problem . actually resolving",
    "the mass of even one single planetesimal with meter - sized objects would require on the order of a billion particles , which is way beyond current computational resources .",
    "we examine the region around the densest grid point of run a at a time of @xmath186 orbits in more detail .",
    "this time is chosen because there occurs a large concentration of particles , see fig .",
    "[ f : npmax_t ] .",
    "we consider the @xmath187 nearest particles to the densest point and calculate for @xmath187 between @xmath188 and 200,000 the particle number density @xmath121 , the velocity dispersion @xmath172 and its directional components , the free - fall time @xmath189 , and the radius of the clump together with the jeans radius @xmath190 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : misc_vs_n ] .",
    "it is reasonable to require at least @xmath191 for a measurement to be statistically significant ( for @xmath192 the relative counting error falls below 10% , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is also reasonable to require that the size of the clump be larger than the size of a grid cell , since any structure in the concentration within a single grid is not well - resolved .",
    "the same is true for the velocity dispersion . at @xmath191",
    "the dust number density is more than 130 times the average , but the radius of the @xmath191 clump is only around 0.007 , which is smaller than the grid cell radius of @xmath193 . at @xmath194 the clump has the size of a grid cell , and here the number density is more like @xmath10 times the average .",
    "this must be multiplied by the enhancement by sedimentation , which is around @xmath195 , to give a dust - to - gas ratio increase by a factor of @xmath196 compared to the original value in the disc .",
    "the velocity dispersion is around @xmath197 . that includes the velocity dispersion due to the background shear , but this is not a very important effect anyway because the size of the overdense clump is very small .",
    "at small scales the velocity dispersion is completely dominated by the radial component , according to fig .",
    "[ f : misc_vs_n ] , whereas the shear only takes over at larger scales .",
    "the free - fall time is a bit below the clump life - time , which is typically one shear time ( see insert in fig .  [",
    "f : npmax_t ] ; note that the time unit is in orbits ) . for calculating the jeans radius we have had to adopt a column density as high as @xmath198 in order to have the clump to be gravitationally unstable",
    "this is mainly due to the high velocity dispersion .",
    "the radius of the clump is around one jeans radius at @xmath199 , so the clump is gravitationally bound at this scale and would be subject to further contraction by self - gravity .",
    "the gravitationally unstable region is around three grid cells in diameter , but even though this is well within the dissipative scales of the turbulence , the effect of the unresolved turbulence on the motion of the particles should be very little , as such small scale turbulence has short life - times and low amplitudes compared to the large scales . extrapolating the resolved large scale turbulence to the grid - scale with a kolmogorov law",
    "gives lower turbulent velocities than the particle velocity dispersion that we already measure at the grid scale .",
    "thus we conclude that the unresolved turbulence has little or no influence on the particle dynamics .",
    "the concentrations and velocity dispersions are exclusively driven by the large resolved scales of the gas motion .",
    "the solid size of the forming object would be roughly 400 km if all the 1000 superparticles end up in just one large body .",
    "on the other hand , the outcome of such a collapse may also favor the further fragmentation of the clump .",
    "this all depends on how the velocity dispersion behaves with increasing density . in the @xmath143-body simulations of @xcite gas drag works as an efficient way to dissipate the gravitational energy that is released in the contraction of protoplanetesimal clusters .",
    "only such simulations , that include self - gravity and gas drag , could show the further evolution of the overdense boulder clumps that we see in the present work .    for decameter - sized bodies ( run c ) ,",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ f : misc_vs_n_ot10.0 ] the same quantities as in fig .",
    "[ f : misc_vs_n ] around the densest point at a time of 53 orbits .",
    "this time we adopt the minimum mass solar nebula column density of @xmath200 , which gives a mid - plane density of @xmath201 . because of the high friction time , the dust - to - gas ratio in the mid - plane ( eq.[[eq : eps1 ] ] ) is now 0.71 .",
    "the richardson number is correspondingly lower at around @xmath202 , so it is still stable to kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "the mass of the individual superparticles is here @xmath203 .",
    "the density is slightly smaller than for meter - sized bodies , at statistically significant counts around 50 times the average , but the velocity dispersion is lower , and also the overdense region is much larger than it was for meter - sized boulders .",
    "thus already a minimum mass solar nebula can produce a gravitational instability .",
    "the unstable region is as large as 10 grid cells in diameter , and contains around @xmath2 particles .",
    "the size of a solid object consisting of this number of superparticles is roughly 1,400 kilometers .",
    "again there is also the possibility that millions of @xmath204-kilometer objects form instead .",
    "the preceding calculations are of course only an estimation of the potential importance of self - gravity . in a real protoplanetary disc",
    "there will be a distribution of dust grain sizes present at any time .",
    "if e.g. fragmentation is important , as discussed in the introduction , then the greater part ( @xmath205 ) of the mass may still be present in bodies that are well below one meter in radius @xcite . with only @xmath206 of the mass in the size range between one and ten meters",
    ", the critical column density could be as much as a factor of two higher than stated above . however , this is still in the range of the masses derived for circumstellar discs .",
    "so the qualitative picture that the clumps are gravitationally unstable for physically reasonable gas column densities is robust .    to quantify the velocity dispersion in the entire box ,",
    "we have calculated the average values over all the grid cells .",
    "the results are shown in the last four columns of table [ t : simres ] .",
    "grid cells with 0 or 1 particles have been excluded from the average because the velocity dispersion is per definition zero in these underresolved cells .",
    "the meter - sized bodies have the highest velocity dispersion , around @xmath207 , whereas decimeter bodies have @xmath208 and decameter bodies have a value of @xmath209 .",
    "these values are similar to the turbulent velocities of the gas at the largest scales of the box ( see fig .  2 in jk05 ) , which again shows that these large scales are the drivers of the particle dynamics .",
    "interestingly run d , which is similar to run a only without the radial pressure gradient , has the same velocity dispersion as run a , so the radial pressure gradient does not add extra velocity dispersion to the boulders .",
    "the toroidal component of the velocity dispersion is similar for all the runs because it is dominated by the shear over a grid cell .",
    "run c has a twice as large radial velocity dispersion as run b. this can be explained because the large particles in run c react much slower to the local behavior of the gas , and thus particles of different velocities and histories are mixed in together .",
    "the behavior of the velocity dispersion with increasing dust density is relevant for gravitational instability calculations .",
    "the average velocity dispersion , and the fluctuation width , as a function of the number of particles in a grid cell is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : sigmap_n ] .",
    "again it is evident that the velocity dispersion for @xmath210 of unity is largest .",
    "for all runs the velocity dispersion typically rises until there are around 50 particles in the cell . then the dispersions stay constant all the way to 200 particles .",
    "thus the equation of state of the particles is isothermal , at least up to 30 times the average dust density .",
    "we have considered the effect of magnetorotational turbulence on the motion of dust particles with a freely evolving space coordinate . the particle treatment was necessary over the fluid treatment , because the mean free path of the macroscopic dust boulders is so long that they can no longer be treated as a fluid .",
    "the use of magnetorotational turbulence may not be completely justified in the mid - plane of the disc where the ionization fraction due to radiation and cosmic particles is low .",
    "but due to its kolmogorov - like properties , where energy is injected at the unstable large scales and then cascades down to smaller and smaller scales , magnetorotational turbulence can be seen as a sort of `` generic disc turbulence '' .    we find that the turbulence acts on the particles by concentrating meter - sized boulders locally by up to a factor of 100 and by reducing their radial drift by @xmath0 .",
    "both the concentrations and the reduced radial drift happen because the dust particles are temporarily trapped in radial density enhancements .",
    "one would not expect such structures to be long - lived in a general turbulent flow , but magnetorotational turbulence in accretion discs is subject to a strong shear that favors elongated toroidal structures . in the presented simulations the typical life - time of the structures is on the order of a few orbits , corresponding to tens or even hundreds of years in the outer parts of a protoplanetary disc .",
    "when the density structures eventually dissolve , new structures appear at other locations .",
    "we find a strong correlation between a gas column density of a few percent above the average and a several times increase in the dust column density .",
    "we have also seen some evidence for increased dust density in regions of anticyclonicity , but the long friction time of the dust particles makes it difficult to identify the gas flow that caused a given concentration , because the concentration may drift away from the creation site .",
    "the large concentrations naturally occur near the grid scale . in finite resolution computer simulations the dissipative length scale",
    "must necessarily be moved from the extremely small dissipative scales of nature to the smallest scales of the simulation box .",
    "thus the turbulence is not well - resolved near the grid scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the concentrations are driven by the largest scales of the turbulence , because there are the largest velocities and the longest lived features @xcite .",
    "already the other well - resolved but slightly smaller scales fluctuate too quick and at too low speeds to influence the path of an object that is one meter in size or larger .",
    "this argument is given support by the fact that we measure particle velocity dispersions in the grid cells that are comparable to the velocity amplitude of the gas at the largest scales of the simulation .",
    "thus , one should not expect higher resolution to change the concentrations or the velocity dispersions significantly .",
    "our estimation of the minimum gas column density that would make the densest protoplanetesimal clumps gravitationally unstable is necessarily based on many assumptions .",
    "we assumed that half of the dust mass in the disc was present in bodies of the considered size , whereas in real discs an even larger part of the dust mass may be bound in small fragments that result from catastrophic collisions .",
    "we also ignored the back - reaction from the dust on the gas .",
    "the background state has , both for meter and decameter bodies , a dust - to - gas ratio just below unity ( where the back - reaction becomes important ) .",
    "the effect of dust drag on the magnetorotational instability has to our knowledge never been considered .",
    "one can speculate that the drag force will mimic a strong viscosity and thus disable the source of turbulence where the dust density is high .",
    "for the treatment of kelvin - helmholtz instability we based it simply on a criterion on the richardson number @xmath168 .",
    "there is some indication that this may be too simplistic and that in protoplanetary discs much higher richardson numbers are also unstable @xcite , but one can also speculate that the full inclusion of dust particles in simulations of kelvin - helmholtz turbulence would show strong local concentrations like we see here for magnetorotational turbulence .",
    "thus the exact values of six times the minimum solar nebula for meter - sized boulders and just the minimum mass solar nebula for decameter - sized boulders should only be considered as rough estimates . still , the result that the clumps are gravitationally unstable for reasonable gas column densities is robust enough to warrant further investigations that include treatment of self - gravity between the boulders .",
    "thus we find that the gravoturbulent formation of planetesimals from the fragmentation of an overdense swarm of meter - sized rocks is possible .",
    "turbulence is in this picture not an obstacle , but rather the ignition spark , as it is responsible for generating the local gravitationally bound overdensities in the vertically sedimented layer of boulders .",

    "<S> we find that the densest clumps of solids are gravitationally unstable under physically reasonable values for the gas column density and for the dust - to - gas ratio due to sedimentation . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that planetesimals can form in a dust layer that is not in itself dense enough to undergo gravitational fragmentation , and that fragmentation happens in turbulent density fluctuations in this sublayer . </S>"
