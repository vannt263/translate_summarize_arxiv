    "the structure of @xmath1 is relatively transparent , its @xmath7 has been solved ( see @xcite , p. 112 ) and it is closely related to the @xmath4-cube ( the sierpinski gasket pyramid graph s competition for multiprocessor architecture ) .",

    "obviously , if we add more pegs and retain the same rules , the puzzle just becomes easier to solve ( although the minimum number of moves , even for @xmath361 ( and arbitrary @xmath4 ) , has never been completely determined .",

    "it follows then that @xmath376 and @xmath377 , making the graph of the game @xmath337 .",
    "the tower of hanoi puzzle , as proposed by eduard lucas in 1881 , started with all @xmath4 discs on one peg ( say @xmath17 ) and ended with all of them on another peg ( say @xmath238 ) . some puzzles , such as rubik s cube , are started from a random position .",
    "if the tower of hanoi is started from a random position , it would appear to be a much more complex problem .",
    "it would be simple to select a position at random by labeling the sides of a triangular prism @xmath386 and tossing it @xmath4 times to generate a random member of @xmath387 . in the example , starting at @xmath384 , the largest disc starts on peg @xmath17 and must be moved to peg @xmath238 . in order to do that the three smaller discs must be moved to peg @xmath237 .",
    "after the largest disc is transferred from peg @xmath17 to peg @xmath238 , the three smaller discs may be transferred from peg @xmath237 to peg @xmath238 .",
    "thus the problem is recursively solvable and the same holds in general .",
    "however , deciding the optimal move from a given position , such as @xmath384 seems overwhelming .",

    "thus the unique shortest path from @xmath44    to @xmath62 starts with    @xmath146 and continues with the unique    shortest path from @xmath51 to @xmath400 case @xmath237 : :    @xmath401    such that @xmath402 and @xmath403 for    @xmath404 .",
