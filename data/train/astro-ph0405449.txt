    "in recent years , extensive optical and near - infrared ( nir ) follow - up of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has revealed a physical connection between a significant fraction of long - duration grbs and core - collapse supernov ( sne ) .",
    "first , the bright sn1998bw was discovered spatially and temporally coincident with grb980425 @xcite .",
    "however , grb980425 was rather different from classical , cosmological grbs , being severely underenergetic and lacking an optical afterglow .",
    "then , sn2003dh was detected in the afterglow of grb030329 @xcite .",
    "both sne showed broad bumps in their spectra , indicating very large expansion velocities ( up to @xmath7  km / s ) , and were extremely bright .",
    "these highly - energetic sne are often named hypernov ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "last , bumps discovered in the light curves of several afterglows , peaking @xmath8  days after the grb , have been interpreted as due to the emerging of sne out of the afterglow light , based on their brightness , temporal evolution and colors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bumps resemble the light curve of sn1998bw , with a certain scatter in the brightness and rise time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic confirmation that the bump of grb021211 has a sn spectrum ( sn2002lt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) supports this conclusion .",
    "these observations indicate that the grb / sn association is common .",
    "grb031203 was discovered by the integral satellite on 2003 dec 3.91769 ut @xcite , with a duration of @xmath9  s and a peak flux of @xmath10  erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ( @xmath13  kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "the precise and fast dissemination of the grb coordinates by the integral burst alert system @xcite allowed an effective search for the afterglow .",
    "we also immediately activated our too program at eso , starting nir observations at the ntt 7  hours after the grb @xcite .",

    "[ tb : phot ] .    image reduction and analysis",
    "were performed following the standard procedures , by means of both aperture photometry and psf - matched image subtraction . to avoid saturation from a nearby bright star , the exposure time was always kept short . in same cases ,",
    "occulting bars were placed to cover the bright star ( showing that the effect was negligible ) .",
    "optical and nir photometry were calibrated against landolt standard stars and the 2mass , respectively . to focus on the issue of variability , in tab .",
    "[ tb : phot ] we list just the relative photometry with respect to a reference epoch .",
    "we should also note that the host galaxy spectrum is dominated by prominent emission lines .",
    "this may lead to relatively large offsets when comparing results from other instruments , owing to unavoidable small differences in the filter profiles and ccd efficiencies .",
    "additional @xmath26 and @xmath27 photometry was acquired with the 2  m magnum telescope of the university of tokyo @xcite , located in the hawaii islands .",
    "although the different shape of the magnum and eso @xmath27 filters ( particularly critical due to the presence of the bright h@xmath28 line in the blue filter wing ) makes it difficult to compare the results , the data are in good agreement ( tab .",

    "this may explain the different finding of @xcite , who need no stretch , and @xcite , who find a longer rise .",
    "assuming a light curve shape similar to sn1998bw , which had a rise time of 16  days in the @xmath30 band , our data suggest an explosion time nearly simultaneous with the grb .",

    "<S> the determination of the absolute magnitude of this sn ( sn2003lw ) is difficult owing to the large and uncertain extinction , but likely this event was brighter than sn1998bw by @xmath4  mag in the @xmath5 bands , reaching an absolute magnitude @xmath6 . </S>"
