    "being relevant to a wide range of practical scenarios , the behavior of colloid suspensions near solid surfaces has been thoroughly studied over the years .",
    "this research effort consists of several bodies of work , for each of which we can give only a few representative references .",
    "the first category of papers concerns the disruption of the structural isotropy of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) fluid suspension by the surface , e.g. , the formation of a layered structure decaying away from the surface under equilibrium @xcite and nonequilibrium @xcite conditions .",
    "another category addresses the effect of the anisotropic geometry on particle dynamics near a single planar surface  for isolated particles @xcite , particle pairs @xcite , and a 3d suspension adjacent to a surface @xcite .",
    "regarding quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) layers of particles , most studies have considered the confinement of suspensions between two rigid surfaces .",
    "this research addressed structural properties of such confined suspensions @xcite , and the dynamics of single particles @xcite , particle pairs @xcite , and concentrated quasi-2d suspensions @xcite .",
    "another type of quasi-2d suspensions has also been studied , where a particle layer is confined to a fluid interface @xcite .    in cases where the surface attracts the particles and the suspension",
    "is sufficiently dilute , the system can contain a single layer of surface - associated particles in contact with a practically particle - free solvent @xcite .",
    "a single layer can also form as a result of gravitational settling of particles toward a horizontal wall .",
    "this scenario is studied in the present work .    sedimented colloidal particles undergo random brownian displacements , which results in diffusive broadening of the fluctuating particle layer .",
    "the width of the particle height distribution above the bottom surface is characterized by the sedimentation length @xmath0 , i.e. , the height at which the gravitational energy of a particle equals its thermal energy .",
    "the dynamics and height distribution of individual sedimented particles above the bottom surface were studied in refs .",
    "using total internal reflection microscopy .",
    "particle monolayers at higher densities were investigated experimentally for a system in which the sedimentation length is much smaller than the particle diameter @xcite .",
    "it was shown that at high area fractions the suspension can assemble into quasi-2d colloidal crystals , but formation of a nonuniform vertical microstructure was not observed , because of the small sedimentation length .",
    "here we are interested in the structure and dynamics of a surface - associated layer for which the sedimentation length is comparable to the particle diameter .",
    "we focus on the effects of the suspension concentration on the statistical height distribution of particles and their diffusion coefficient . unlike the quasi-2d suspensions confined between two surfaces or adsorbed at a fluid interface ( which restricts particle configurations and motions in two directions ) in the present system no constraints are imposed on the distance between the particles and the single wall .",
