    "currently , inflation  @xcite is the leading candidate of resolving many cosmological problems such as the horizon , flatness and monopole problems , and of explaining the initial conditions of the successful hot big bang universe .",
    "a certain amount of quasi - exponential expansion of the universe during inflation out of small enough region for maintaining causal communication makes the whole observable patch of the universe homogeneous and isotropic as well as spatially flat . at the same time",
    ", the quantum fluctuations of one or more scalar fields , the inflaton fields , which dominate the energy density of the universe during inflation are stretched and become large scale perturbations of spatial curvature .",
    "these curvature perturbations are the seed of the large scale structure and the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observed today  @xcite .",
    "recent precise cosmological observations are all consistent with this picture and thus indeed strongly support the inflation paradigm  @xcite .    in spite of the extreme success of the inflation paradigm , the _ very _ inflation relevant for our own universe is still veiled in mystery .",
    "it is because of the lacking of knowledge on particle physics : the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) is one of the most precise theory of physics  @xcite , but also is a limited effective theory of what describes all the interactions in nature at the very high energy scales relevant for the early universe .",
    "for example , the sm does not explain the neutrino mass  @xcite , the baryon asymmetry  @xcite , dark matter  @xcite , as well as the inflaton fields .",
    "fortunately , we have several reasonable and attractive extensions of the sm such as supersymmetry  @xcite and extra dimensional theories  @xcite , which presumably will be tested at the large hadron collider at cern  @xcite in the next couple of years .",
    "the extended theories of the sm commonly postulate the existence of a large number of scalar fields other than the higgs field which is the sole but yet undiscovered scalar field of the sm .",
    "therefore , it is very natural to consider inflation models driven by these multiple number of scalar fields as a plausible realization of inflation in this context  @xcite .",
    "the only way to investigate and falsify inflation models is , at best of our current knowledge , to study the primordial curvature perturbation .",
    "it is observed to be nearly adiabatic and gaussian , with an almost scale invariant spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we naturally expect all of these properties for single field inflation models . it can be intuitively understood as follows : as the only degree of freedom during inflation is the single inflaton field , basically the fluctuations of the inflaton translate into time difference .",
    "this gives rise to perfectly adiabatic perturbations . also , suppressed self interaction of the inflaton field required by the observed small deviation from the scale invariance ensures different fourier modes of the field fluctuations almost perfectly independent from each other",
    "this leads to nearly perfect gaussianity .",
    "thus , any deviation from perfect adiabaticity or gaussianity can be a strong indicator of the existence of more than a single inflaton field . according to the most recent wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 5-year data  @xcite ,",
    "the observational constraints are such that the isocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation contributes to the total density perturbation on the cmb scales at most about 10% , and the non - linear parameter @xmath3 at 95% confidence level , which confirms gaussianity of the primordial perturbation at 0.1% accuracy .    for inflation models driven by a multiple number of fields , in contrast",
    ", there is no such unique predictions . given a field trajectory ,",
    "there are more than one orthogonal directions into which the field can be ` kicked ' , then the trajectory can be changed from one to another , i.e. the history of the universe can be entirely changed . thus we need to keep tracking the history until different trajectories coalesce and there remains effectively only one degree of freedom : matter domination  @xcite .",
    "therefore in principle it is never sufficient to consider only the inflationary phase to make any cosmological predictions , as still a large number of the inflaton fields survive after inflation and they can subsequently change the history of the universe after the end of the inflation .",
    "for example , let us consider the curvaton scenario  @xcite : in that scenario , one or more oscillating light scalar fields become dominant component of the energy density of the universe in the homogeneous radiation background .",
    "the observable quantities such as the power spectrum and its spectral index can be completely different from naive inflationary predictions , depending on the energy fraction of the curvaton fields at the moment of their decay .",
    "these curvaton fields themselves can be interpreted as the inflaton fields which have not yet decayed until the radiation dominated era , as the individual inflaton field can easily satisfy the requirements any curvaton candidate should do  @xcite .",
    "therefore , on completely general ground , we should consider the _",
    "entire _ evolution of the universe until matter domination beyond the inflationary epoch when we consider multi - field inflation models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a complete set of background and perturbed equations which describe the universe starting from multi - field inflation , and to study the evolution of the curvature perturbation .",
    "especially , we are interested in the isocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation which can be observationally detected in near future and thus may be a powerful probe of the early universe .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of large isocurvature perturbation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec_equations ] , we present the background and perturbed equations of the components which constitute the universe .",
    "they are the inflaton fields , and the decay products of the inflaton fields : radiation and matter .",
    "we write the equations in the spatially flat gauge which is particularly useful for our purpose .",
    "we then give the equations of the curvature perturbation associated with individual component as well as that of the total curvature perturbation .",
    "in section  [ sec_results ] , we present the numerical results based on the simple chaotic inflation model .",
    "we also supply analytic arguments which helps understand the results . in section  [ sec_discussions ]",
    "we discuss the importance of the post - inflationary evolution and the possibility of generating large isocurvature perturbation .",
    "we present our conclusion in section 5 .",
    "in this section we present the evolution equations of both background and perturbed quantities which constitute the universe .",

    "this can be easily read from the numerical results of the previous section , where the curvature perturbation associated with the lightest ( heaviest ) field is larger ( smaller ) than the total one .",

    "@xcite , there is hardly any model independent prediction on the matter - isocurvature perturbation and the detail depends on the specific decay rates .",
    "the decay rate we have used for the numerical computations is essentially @xmath162 which is directly related to the mass of the field . while it would not be completely impossible to contrive a non - trivial decay rate which can lead to large matter - radiation isocurvature perturbation , it is not very likely that the fields whose masses are spread over less than a decade ( see eq .",
    "( [ mpdist ] ) for example ) have completely different decay rates to generate abruptly large matter - radiation isocurvature perturbation .",
    "especially , in our numerical computations in the previous section we set all @xmath157 the same , and this leads to indeed negligible effects of @xmath156 during matter dominated era .",
    "therefore , most probably it would be very hard to have large enough matter - radiation isocurvature perturbation in the context of the current model .",
    "thus , we need to break the assumptions of the model we have explicitly investigated , i.e. the potential includes interaction terms and is no more separable and/or the decay rate is not constant so that @xmath157 spans a wide range of numbers as @xmath158 ( see figure  [ fig : coeffs ] ) .",

    "if the difference of masses is large enough , such as double inflation  @xcite , then it is possible to obtain large isocurvature perturbation .",
    "we have also specifically assumed that the matter component is decoupled from radiation already at the stage of generation .",
    "this can be possible only for the extremely weakly interacting particles , such as gravitino or axino if they are produced dominantly from the decay  @xcite .",
    "for the thermally produced dark matter , which is currently the popular candidate , the curvature perturbation of matter is the same as that of radiation since they had common values during thermal equilibrium .",
    "in this case there will be no or negligible isocurvature perturbation .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the evolution of the curvature perturbation during and after multi - field inflation .",

( [ eomdeltaphii ] ) , ( [ eomdeltarhog ] ) , ( [ eomdeltarhom ] ) and ( [ pcontinuity ] ) . using them , we have presented the curvature perturbations associated with each component , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 which correspond to radiation , matter and @xmath4 respectively , eqs .",

    "[ case1 ] , [ case2 ] and [ case3 ] we have present the numerical results , and have found that @xmath68 is continuously varying not only during inflation but also afterward .",
    "we have presented an analytic argument to account for the evolution of @xmath68 , which is solely due to the existence of the non - adiabatic contributions of the curvature perturbation @xmath170 given by eq .",

    "it is clearly and explicitly shown that the total curvature perturbation @xmath68 is not fixed but is constantly varying on the super - horizon scale , even after the end of inflation .",
    "this indicates that any predictions of multi - field inflation based only on the inflationary epoch may not capture important information about the evolution of the universe : e.g. eqs .",
    "( [ pcurv ] ) and ( [ pcurv_deltan0 ] ) .",
    "this also implies that until full radiation domination by the decay of the inflaton fields , the inflatons themselves can modify @xmath68  la the curvaton mechanism .",
    "finally , the isocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation , which may be detected by near future cosmological observations , becomes large enough only when the decay rates are highly non - trivial .",
    "this suggests that large matter - radiation isocurvature perturbation , if ever detected at all , will be a challenge to our current understanding on the decay process of the inflaton fields .",
