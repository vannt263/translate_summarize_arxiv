    "statistical mechanics underwent a major development in the early 1990s , and this gave rise to what were to be collectively known as fluctuation relations .",
    "it had long been observed that systems with few degrees of freedom are especially susceptible to fluctuations and seemingly behave as if they violate the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "these violations are however quantifiable .",
    "evans et al .",
    "@xcite were able to calculate the relative likeliness between a regular trajectory of events and the corresponding reversed trajectory that violates the second law in a strongly sheared fluid system .",
    "independently , jarzynski  @xcite and crooks  @xcite found a relationship that ties together the amount of time - dependent work during a non - equilibrium process and the change in the system s free energy .",
    "all these relations are valid for an arbitrarily long time , and arbitrarily far from equilibrium . over the following decades ,",
    "fluctuation relations were generalized and put onto a more solid mathematical foundation  @xcite , and they were experimentally verified in several systems , such as the motion of colloidal particles in a harmonic trap  @xcite , an electrical dipole driven out of equilibrium  @xcite , and the unfolding and refolding of a small rna hairpin  @xcite .",
    "in essence , fluctuation relations can be understood simply as a change of variables in probability space .",
    "let probability measure @xmath0 on a measurable space ( @xmath1 ) be absolutely continuous with respect to another measure @xmath2 on the same space .",
    "one can then define random variable @xmath3 such that @xmath4 here @xmath5 is formally known as the radon - nikodm derivative which describes the rate of change of probability in one measure with respect to the other  @xcite .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is used to denote the average over the forward measure .",
    "( [ e : tft ] ) and ( [ e : ift ] ) are known respectively as detailed and integral fluctuation theorems .",
    "the interested reader is referred to ref .   and for excellent overviews of the mathematical concepts of fluctuation theorems .",
    "at this stage these relations are devoid of any physical meanings .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that if @xmath0 represents the probability ( density ) that a forward trajectory @xmath8 is observed during @xmath9 according to some protocol @xmath10 , and @xmath2 is the probability of observing the corresponding backward trajectory @xmath11 with time - reversed protocol @xmath12 , then @xmath3 denotes the entropy production of the combined system and environment along the trajectory during that duration .",
    "( see appendix  [ sec : entropyisbounded ] for a mathematical construction and an example of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the case of an inhomogeneous markov jump process . )",
    "it is important to note that the initial state of the backward trajectory is taken to be the final state of the forward trajectory , and vice versa .",
    "other choices of protocols and boundary values yield other types of entropies . for example , esposito and van den broeck  @xcite recently showed that the trajectory - wise total entropy production can be split into two pieces , the adiabatic ( @xmath13 ) and the nonadiabatic ( @xmath14 ) pieces , @xmath15 , which separately satisfy fluctuation relations ( [ e : tft ] ) and ( [ e : ift ] ) . for a comprehensive review of various boundary conditions and the associated entropies ,",

    "we shall denote the supremum ( infimum ) of the total entropy production at time @xmath16 over all sampling trajectories by @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . since the exponential function is convex , an application of jensen s inequality to ( [ e : ift ] ) implies the second law inequality .",
    "in other words , @xmath19 implies that @xmath20 .",
    "the equality is reached when the system is in equilibrium , otherwise the system and the environment must produce net positive total entropy on average .",
    "surely there must exist an upper limit to this number that is below @xmath17 .",
    "the question is , thus , if nothing else but the two limits @xmath17 and @xmath18 are known , can we place an upper bound of @xmath21 based on them ?    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "before venturing into the general derivation of computing the upper bound of a convex function over a domain with a known average , we present here the simplest working case .",
    "suppose @xmath22 is a positive random variable such that @xmath23 almost surely , and @xmath24 is a convex function on the domain of @xmath22 .",

    "condition @xmath75 gives rise to what is known in the mathematical community as the ( shifted ) polar dual of @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "a notable property of polar dual @xmath71 is that it is convex even though @xmath56 is not .",

    "geometrically these vectors form a pyramid whose base represents the corresponding facet of @xmath57 perpendicular to @xmath90 .",
