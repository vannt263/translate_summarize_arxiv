    "the @xmath1 ( lao / sto ) system is a fascinating manifestation of electronic reconstruction at the interface of two insulating oxides which leads to the emergence of electrical conductivity with reduced dimensionality .",
    "consequently , this system has become the focus of intensive experimental and theoretical effort to elucidate its rich electronic properties @xcite , which is a challenging task considering the sensitivity of this system to many parameters such as oxygen pressure during growth , the thickness of the lao layer , post growth treatment , etc .",
    "one of the most intriguing properties of the lao / sto system is the emergence of magnetism , which appears to be sensitive to growth conditions . in lao",

    "/ sto samples grown in lower oxygen pressure ( @xmath6-@xmath7 mbar ) , magnetism has been first suggested based on magnetotransport properties @xcite . recently , local imaging using a scanning superconducting quantum interference device @xcite and high - resolution magnetic torque magnetometry measurements @xcite have provided direct evidence for magnetic order in such samples . in the latter , magnetization was found to persist up to @xmath8 .",
    "the emerging picture from the local probe measurements is of submicron patches of ferromagnetism with a wide distribution of size and easy axis orientation .",
    "interestingly , fewer ferromagnetic patches were found in a patterned sample @xcite .",
    "the results presented here suggest that linked to a resistivity increase , the magnetism may be suppressed post fabrication .",
    "we study patterned lao / sto samples grown in an oxygen atmosphere of @xmath9 mbar and show that for patterns with length scales of several microns the sheet resistance ( @xmath0 ) at low temperatures may increase significantly in connection with driving electrical currents and applying in - plane magnetic fields .",
    "the @xmath0 increase is nonuniform ; therefore , it yields variations in the properties of the lao / sto system within a given sample and between samples .",
    "the initial as - cooled @xmath0 is recovered by warming the samples .",
    "we identify two temperatures ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) near which an accelerated recovery of @xmath0 is observed .",
    "we suggest charge trapping as a possible origin of the @xmath0 increase .    concomitantly with the @xmath0 increase , the carrier density and the mobility decrease and there are dramatic changes in the magnetotransport properties of the samples . as we will show , hall effect ( he ) and magnetoresistance ( mr ) properties which suggest the existence of magnetism in the as - cooled samples are gradually suppressed as @xmath0 increases .    the observed @xmath0 increase , which may affect dramatically the transport properties of patterns on the order of several microns and less , has important implications for the future design of submicron devices . in addition ,",

    "figure [ he]a shows that , while the he resistance of the as - cooled sample is nonlinear in field , the nonlinearity gradually vanishes with increasing @xmath0 .",

    "the suppression of @xmath30 with increasing @xmath0 would suggest suppression of magnetism if the nonlinearity can be attributed to anomalous he ( ahe ) .",
    "however , nonlinear he at @xmath45 can be attributed to the contribution of two ( or more ) bands @xcite . measuring the he as a function of @xmath20 may distinguish between the two scenarios . while the ordinary he",
    "( ohe ) in the two - band scenario follows a @xmath34 angular dependence ( even when it exhibits a nonlinear field dependence at @xmath20=@xmath46 ) , the contribution of the ahe may show deviations from a @xmath34 angular dependence when the magnetization is not parallel to the applied magnetic field due to magnetic anisotropy or when the magnitude of the magnetization varies with @xmath20 .",

    "we see that the deviations are particularly large near @xmath20=@xmath33 .",
    "the data shown in figure [ ehe ] are for patterns with @xmath38 m which exhibit relatively small @xmath0 increases during the angular - dependent measurements ( less than 3@xmath28 ) . however , the features shown in the figure are observed in tens patterns of different samples with various current path widths , including in patterns with @xmath12 m which exhibit large @xmath0 increases ; although for these patterns , the data are significantly affected by the field - induced increase in @xmath0 as @xmath20 approaches @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ ehe]d shows for nine different patterns with similar as - cooled @xmath24 the maximum value of @xmath35 ( @xmath37 ) as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "the figure indicates that there is a clear correlation between the deviations from a @xmath34 behavior and the nonlinearity of the he .",
    "this correlation is expected if the source of the nonlinearity is magnetism .",
    "it is less expected if the source of the nonlinearity is a two - band contribution where no deviation from a @xmath34 behavior is expected .",
    "the interplay between the nonuniform @xmath0 increase and the dramatic changes in magnetotransport properties suggests that charge trapping , which decreases carrier density and increases disorder , suppresses magnetism in this system .",
    "the nonuniform nature of the magnetism we find is consistent with recent experiments which present unequivocal evidence for magnetism @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we note that whereas the angular dependence of the mr and the he suggests perpendicular magnetic anisotropy @xcite , these reports find mainly in - plane magnetic moment .",
    "the suppression of magnetization may be linked to the decrease in @xmath24 or to the increase in disorder .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath24 at which @xmath30 disappears varies between samples may imply that the existence of magnetic properties is not determined only by @xmath24 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we identify low - temperature @xmath0 increases in connection with driving an electrical current higher than a certain threshold through the pattern and/or applying a strong enough in - plane magnetic field .",
    "irrespective of the method used to increase @xmath0 , as the sample is warmed up , @xmath0 recovers to its original value with accelerated recovery near 70 k and 160 k. the @xmath0 increase is accompanied by a decrease in carrier density and mobility , and since it is nonuniform , it increases the nonhomogeneity of the sample .",
    "in addition , we find a clear link between the @xmath0 increase and the suppression of magnetotransport properties which can be linked to magnetism .",
    "the existence of the @xmath0-increase mechanism and its effect on magnetotransport is important both for future design of submicron devices and for elucidating the transport and magnetic properties of the lao / sto system .",
