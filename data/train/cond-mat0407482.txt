    "theoretical investigation of the structure , energy , dynamics , and stability of vortices in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) has received increased attention since bose - einstein condensation was achieved in trapped alkali - metal gases at ultralow temperatures ; for a comprehensive review , see for example @xcite .",
    "quantised vorticity is an intriguing feature of superfluidity , and much effort was therefore devoted to manipulating vortices and observing their dynamics .",
    "this provided a valuable tool for elucidating the physics of many - particle systems and relating it to the quantitative predictions of thermal field theories .",
    "the condensates of alkali vapours are pure and dilute , so that the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) model , which is the so - called ` mean - field limit ' of quantum field theories , gives a precise description of their dynamics at low temperatures . the structure and properties of quantised vortices",
    "were therefore studied experimentally and then refined , both analytically and numerically , by using the gp equation .",
    "conversely , the predictions on vortex properties based on the gp model were later confirmed experimentally . besides vortices",
    ", only one other localised disturbance has been detected experimentally : the one - dimensional solitary wave ( the ` dark soliton ' ) was created from a density depletion ( phase imprinting ) in a bec of sodium atoms @xcite .",
    "the focus of this report is on a different class of solitary waves that should exist in a condensate : these are the vorticity - free axisymmetric disturbances whose existence was predicted by jones and roberts @xcite on the basis of numerical integrations of @xmath0 where @xmath1 . in this dimensionless form of the gp equation ,",
    "the unit of length is the healing length , the speed of sound is @xmath2 , and the density at infinity is @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast with the vortices and vortex rings that were extensively studied in superfluid helium systems long before the experimental realisation of bose - einstein condensation , the rarefaction solitary waves do not exist in superfluid helium as they move faster than the landau critical velocity .",
    "therefore , the existence of the rarefaction solitary waves is a unique characteristic of bec .",
    "jones and roberts found all solitary wave solutions of the gp equation in two dimensions ( 2d ) and three dimensions ( 3d ) . in a momentum energy ( @xmath4 ) plot , the 3d sequence , which we call the ` jr dispersion curve ' ,",

    "are asymptotic to large circular vortex rings . as @xmath5 and @xmath6 decrease from infinity on this branch ,",
    "the solutions begin to lose their similarity to vortex rings . eventually , for a momentum @xmath13 slightly in excess of @xmath7 , they lose their vorticity ( @xmath14 loses its zero ) , and thereafter the solutions may better be described as ` rarefaction waves ' .",

    "a derrick - type argument @xcite was used in which neighbouring axisymmetric states having the same @xmath5 as the upper branch solution to ( 1 ) were shown to have a smaller @xmath6 .",
    "it would follow that the solution is unstable provided that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the only quantities conserved by ( 1 ) in 3d , but this has never been demonstrated .",
    "moreover , rarefaction waves on the upper branch of the jr dispersion curve are seen in numerical simulations : they evolve from a density depletion of a condensate @xcite and appear during condensate formation from a strongly non - equilibrated bose gas @xcite .",
    "they may exist for a considerable time before they either collapse onto the lower branch of the jr dispersion curve or lose their energy to sound waves and disappear .",
    "evidently there is a paradox . on the one hand ,",
    "if the assumption that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the only conserved quantities in 3d is correct and the upper branch solutions are intrinsically unstable , how could they even form ? on the other hand , if the assumption is false and the upper branch solutions are stable , why do they ultimately disappear ?",
    "is it because they are metastable or because they lose energy and momentum through collisions with other waves in the system ?",
    "the goal of this paper is to resolve this paradox . in section 2 , we demonstrate that the upper branch solitary waves are unstable . in section 3.1 , we show that , nevertheless , a perturbed solitary wave on the upper branch will generally evolve towards an unperturbed state on that branch and remain in its vicinity for a long period .",
    "eventually , however , as illustrated in section 3.2 , it collapses onto the lower branch or disappears entirely .",
    "another facet of such evolutionary processes is studied in section 3.3 , where it is shown how two rarefaction waves from the upper branch that move in the same direction can create a vortex ring . in section 3.4",
    "we demonstrate how unstable rarefaction waves can form from the evolution of a density depletion .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with a brief summary of our findings .",

    "these conclusions suggest that rarefaction solitary waves could be experimentally detected and and studied in bose condensates alongside the vortex rings .",
    "they can be created by laser beams and evolve from a local depletion of the condensate .",
    "rarefaction waves will also appear as the result of the self - evolution of a strongly nonequilibrated bose gas @xcite .",
    "like the vortex rings , they can in principle be observed in expanding condensates .",

    "it was argued in  2.1 that , for every @xmath18 , the spectrum of @xmath77 , where @xmath42 is the growth rate of perturbations is real , discrete and infinite , with limit point at @xmath178 , i.e. , only a finite number of positive @xmath77 can exist for each @xmath47 .",
    "the largest of these is the most significant since , when positive , it gives the largest growth rate for instability .",
    "our numerical work strongly suggested that this @xmath77 is part of the spectrum for the axisymmetric mode and that it changes sign precisely at the cusp , @xmath86 , being positive for @xmath179 and negative for @xmath180 .",
    "the aim of this appendix is to re - enforce this conclusion by showing analytically that this @xmath77 can change sign only at the cusp .",
    "the argument is analogous to one presented by kuznetsov and rasmussen @xcite for 2d solitary waves .    in the axisymmetric case ( @xmath181 ) , ( [ peq ] )",
    "always possesses a neutral solution ( @xmath182 ) corresponding to an infinitesimal displacement of @xmath32 in the @xmath29direction ; we write this as @xmath183 we now seek a neighbouring solution for which @xmath42 is small , vanishing when a double root of @xmath42 exists .",
    "we expand this solution as @xmath184 substituting ( [ pexpand ] ) into ( [ peq ] ) , we obtain @xmath185 the differential of ( [ peq ] ) with respect to @xmath18 and ( [ soln0 ] ) show that the solution to ( [ pexp1 ] ) is @xmath186 a consistency condition follows from ( [ pexp2 ] ) .",

    "it follows from ( [ dpdu ] ) that the double zero of @xmath42 can occur only at the cusp , the only point on the jr dispersion curve where @xmath189 is zero .",
    "in multidimensions the density depletion of the solitary rarefaction wave as well as the characteristic inverse length along the axis of propagation tend to zero as the solitary wave velocity , @xmath18 , approaches the speed of sound , @xmath94 .",
    "this allows us to reduce the gp equation to the kadomtsev - petviashvili type i ( kpi ) equation , that describes the propagation of acoustic waves of small amplitude and positive dispersion .    in @xcite",
    "such a reduction was obtained as a compatibility condition of the equations written to @xmath190 where the small parameter @xmath191 . in what follows",
    "we derive the eigenvalue problem of the gp equation in the limit of @xmath192 and show that it coincides with the eigenvalue problem for the kpi equation for an appropriate scaling of the eigenvalues .",
    "we start by separating the real and imaginary parts of the basic state as @xmath193 and of the perturbation as @xmath194 ; see section 2 .",
    "the basic solution satisfies ( [ ugp ] ) so that @xmath195 while @xmath19 and @xmath44 satisfy ( [ stability1 ] )  ( [ stability2 ] ) where , without loss of generality , we take @xmath181 . to make the reduction to the kpi equation we write",
