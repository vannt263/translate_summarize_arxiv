    "in particular , solutions to hamilton s equations have been examined for various systems whose hamiltonians are @xmath0 symmetric . for such systems the classical trajectories are typically complex @xcite .",
    "these trajectories can lie in many - sheeted riemann surfaces and often have elaborate topological structure .",
    "when the @xmath0 symmetry of the quantum hamiltonian is not broken , the real - energy trajectories of the corresponding classical hamiltonian are found to be closed and periodic @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore a new aspect of complex classical mechanics , namely , the complex extension of chaotic behavior .",
    "specifically , we study two classical systems : the kicked rotor and the double pendulum .",
    "the kicked rotor is a paradigm for studying the dynamics of chaotic systems described by time - dependent hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the planar double pendulum is also a dynamical model whose classical motion is known to be chaotic @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonians for both of these dynamical systems are @xmath0 symmetric so long as the parameters @xmath1 in the hamiltonian for the kicked rotor ( [ e6 ] ) and @xmath2 in the hamiltonian for the double pendulum ( [ e16 ] ) are real .",
    "we use a variety of computational tools in order to derive the numerical results presented .",
    "the c programming language was used to implement of a fully symplectic three - stage gauss - legendre runge - kutta method for the simulation of the double pendulum , and standard functionality in mathematica 6 was used in the study of the kicked - rotor .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ s2 ] we define the kicked rotor and mention briefly the transition associated with the disappearance of kam trajectories . in sec .",

    "these variables satisfy the discretized version of ( [ e2 ] ) : @xmath21    it is conventional to replace @xmath18 and @xmath1 by the dimensionless quantities @xmath22 in terms of which we rewrite ( [ e4 ] ) in dimensionless form as @xmath23 this system of difference equations , which depends on a single dimensionless real parameter @xmath1 , is known as the _",

    "it then follows from the first equation in ( [ e6 ] ) that @xmath18 may also be taken modulo @xmath26 .",
    "thus , ( [ e6 ] ) maps the two dimensional torus onto itself .",

    "a less obvious change is that the regions in which @xmath75 does not diverge for @xmath82 become connected when @xmath1 exceeds @xmath29 .            instead of constraining @xmath1 to be real , we can",
    ", of course , take @xmath1 to be complex . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we take @xmath83 . note that the fractal structure in figs .  [ f5 ] and [ f6 ] is preserved , but it is distorted and loses its left - right symmetry .        rather than requiring that @xmath1 pass its critical value on the real-@xmath1 axis , it is possible to go from a subcritical real value to a supercritical real value via a path in the complex-@xmath1 plane , as in fig .",
    "the pictures making up this figure are constructed from values of @xmath1 that lie on a semicircle of radius @xmath79 and are centered at the critical value @xmath64 in these figures we observe fractal structures like those in figs .  [ f5]-[f7 ] , but they are slightly distorted . however , there is a significant difference in that there is mottling ( replacement of large patches of solid shading by a speckled pattern ) in the graphs where @xmath1 is complex ; this mottling is absent when @xmath1 is pure real or pure imaginary .",

    "the sign of the angular momentum now remains unchanged under parity reflection .",

    "[ f9 ] respectively ) .",
    "this change of symmetry of the system as its couplings vary in complex parameter space is not unusual .",
    "for example , at a generic point in coupling space for the three - dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator , the only symmetry is parity .",
    "however , when any two couplings coincide and are different from the third , the reflection symmetry is enhanced and becomes a continuous symmetry , namely , an @xmath90 symmetry around the third axis .",
    "( there remains parity - time reflection symmetry in the third direction . )",
    "when all three couplings coincide , the symmetry is enhanced further and becomes a full @xmath91 symmetry . ] )        we have performed a closely related study for the double pendulum : we allow @xmath2 to be complex and repeat the numerical analysis of the short - time behavior that we used to produce fig .",
    "we find that as the imaginary part of @xmath2 increases , the fractal - like structure that we see in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] gradually moves outward towards the corners of the figure .",
    "correspondingly , the boundaries between different colored regions become smoother . to demonstrate this effect , we choose four different complex values , @xmath92 , and plot the results in fig .",
    "in this section we study the long - time behavior of the kicked rotor and the double pendulum in complex phase space and we find that they share many qualitative features in this regime as well . by _ long - time _ we mean roughly @xmath93 to @xmath94 time steps or time units rather than the @xmath95 time steps taken in sec .  [ s4 ] .",
    "we find that the solutions to the dynamical equations for these systems exhibit characteristic behaviors at different time scales . on a long - time scale , which is determined by the imaginary part of the initial value of an angle , the solutions tend to _ ring _ ; that is , the envelope of the solution grows and decays to zero with gradually changing periods . on a short - time scale",
    "the solution exhibits a distinct and clearly identifiable rapid oscillation , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] .    we have chosen here to use the language of multiple - scale perturbation theory @xcite to describe this oscillatory behavior . however , for both the kicked rotor and the double pendulum the unperturbed equations",
    "are not linear , and thus the usual techniques of multiple - scale perturbation theory can not be applied directly in these cases .",
    "let us first examine the kicked rotor .",
    "as an initial condition we choose @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] we take @xmath98 and @xmath99 and we plot @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 for @xmath104 . note that while @xmath100 and @xmath75 oscillate within almost constant boundaries , @xmath101 and @xmath103 appear to ring with a period of order @xmath105 . to verify this dependence on @xmath106",
    "we take @xmath107 , which is ten times larger , and we do not change the other initial conditions or the value of @xmath1 .",
    "the result for @xmath101 is given in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] , where we see that the period of the ringing is roughly ten times shorter than the period in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] . in both of these figures",
    "the ringing eventually comes to an abrupt end , at which point the iteration diverges and the amplitude of oscillation becomes infinite ; this happens after about @xmath108 rings in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] and after about eleven rings in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] .",
    "while the inverse of the imaginary part of @xmath72 appears to set the scale of the ringing period , we have found that the length of the ringing period is also sensitive to the value of @xmath1 . in fig .",

    "apart from making the obvious remark that the two nonlinear systems studied in this paper exhibit very similar short - time and long - time dynamical behaviors , this work indicates that studying the dynamics of classical chaotic systems in _ complex _ phase space may help us to understand the onset of chaos .",
    "for example , for the case of the kicked rotor , we observe in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] a change in the complex behavior as @xmath1 increases past @xmath29 .",
    "of course , the results reported here are empirical , but they clearly underscore the need for a deeper analytical understanding of these models .",
