    "extreme value statistics of random variables plays a diverse role in physics , chemistry and biology @xcite .",
    "the topic concerns the probability distributions of the extrema ( i.e. , the maximum @xmath6 or the minimum @xmath7 ) of a set of @xmath8 random variables @xmath9 in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "when the random variables @xmath11 are uncorrelated , the probability distribution of @xmath7 belongs to one of the three universality classes @xcite , but the identification of similar universality classes for the extreme value statistics of correlated random variables is still largely an open problem .",
    "a few results relating to extreme value statistics for correlated random variables in physics , computer science and mathematics have been obtained in the recent past @xcite ; nevertheless , any exact result that can be obtained for correlated random variables is an important addition to the present state of knowledge .",
    "from this perspective , in this paper , we present two main results relating to fluctuating fronts made of discrete particles on a one - dimensional lattice . before we proceed further with our formulation of the problem",
    ", we must note that an intriguing connection between the extreme value statistics of correlated random variables and travelling fronts have already emerged from the recent works @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "these works have demonstrated , for the models they studied , that the cumulative probability distributions of extreme values for correlated random variables admit propagating front solutions , wherein the variance of the extremal variable is the front width itself .",
    "our formulation here , however , is completely the other way round : namely that our systems consist of many _ interacting _ particles , where the dynamics of the systems _ already _ admits front solutions propagating into unstable states .",
    "although in a deterministic mean - field description , these fronts propagate with a fixed speed and a fixed shape at long times , due to the presence of stochasticity involving many particles , the front in a given realization of the system does not move with a uniform speed even at long times  instead , the front speed averaged over an ensemble of front realizations approaches a constant in time at long times .",
    "moreover , as a result of the inherent stochasticity in these systems , the individual front realizations that are initially aligned with each other do not remain so at a later time ; instead their displacement w.r.t .",
    "each other keeps increasing with time ( see fig .",
    "@xcite for an illustration ) .",
    "as explained below , it is the dynamics of the individual front realizations in the ensemble that we pose as a correlated extreme value problem in this paper .    the correspondence between the extremal value statistics and the fluctuating fronts in these systems is easily made by first noticing that in any realization of these systems , the front position can be denoted by the instantaneous position @xmath12 of the foremost ( or the rightmost ) particle @xcite .",
    "the interest then lies in the probability distribution @xmath5 , which describes the statistics of the front position in time for an ensemble of front realizations .",
    "secondly , in a snapshot of one single realization , the configuration of the system is described by the locations of the particles ( as random variables ) @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the total number of particles in that realization at time @xmath0 .",
    "then the instantaneous front position @xmath12 in this formulation is then simply the extremal value @xmath13 $ ] . due to the interparticle interaction within the system defined by the microscopic rules of the dynamics ,",
    "@xmath3 are naturally not independent of each other , and thus @xmath5 simply describes the statistics of the extreme for a set of correlated random variables .    in this paper",
    ", we consider two different systems that admit front solutions propagating into unstable states : ( a ) a fermionic reaction - diffusion system a@xmath14a@xmath15a @xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , where we show that @xmath5 is gaussian , and ( b ) the so - called ( bosonic ) clock model @xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , where @xmath5 has small deviations from the gaussian .",
    "it is important to note here that the front solutions in these models have been analyzed before , in the sense that both the front speed @xmath16 and the front diffusion coefficient @xmath17 ^ 2\\rangle / dt$ ] , respectively based on the first and the second moments of @xmath5 , have previously been analyzed and numerically measured @xcite .",
    "the higher ( than second ) moment of @xmath5 , or @xmath5 itself , however , have not been extensively studied before .",
    "the paper is finally ended with a discussion in sec .",
    "in this model , we consider a one - dimensional lattice on which at most one a particle is allowed per lattice site at any instant  hence the model is named fermionic . the particles can undergo the following three basic moves , shown in fig . [ fig1 ] : ( i ) a particle can diffuse to any one of its neighbour lattice sites with a diffusion rate @xmath18 , provided this neighbouring site is empty .",
    "( ii ) any particle can give birth to another one on any one of its empty neighbour lattice site with a birth rate @xmath19 .",
    "( iii ) any one of two a particles belonging to two neighbouring filled lattice sites can get annihilated with a death rate @xmath20 .     to a neighboring empty site ; _ ( ii ) _ creation of a new particle on a site neighboring an occupied site with rate @xmath19 ; _ ( iii ) _ annihilation of a particle on a site adjacent to an occupied site at a rate @xmath20 .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the lattice indexed by @xmath21 that we consider in this problem is semi - infinite .",
    "the left boundary is impenetrable  no particle can diffuse across the left boundary located on the left of the lattice site @xmath22 , while the system is of infinite extent on the right side . following the usual convention ,",
    "we start with a step initial condition , i.e. , at time @xmath23 , there exists a finite @xmath24 , such that all lattice sites @xmath25 are occupied and @xmath26 are empty .",
    "this system then admits a fluctuating ( and propagating ) front solution for @xmath27 .    earlier work on models of this type has appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the general case",
    "there are essentially only two nontrivial parameters in our model , e.g. , the ratios @xmath28 and @xmath29 , since an overall multiplicative factor simply sets the time scale .",

    "an ensemble of front realizations , let us denote the probability distribution for the foremost occupied lattice site to be at lattice site @xmath30 at time @xmath0 by @xmath5 .",

    "the third and the fourth terms respectively describe the decrease in @xmath5 due to the advance and retreat of a foremost occupied lattice site from position @xmath30 .",

    "similarly , the set of ( time and @xmath34-independent ) conditional occupation densities @xmath45 for @xmath46 can be thought of as determining the front profile in a frame moving with the foremost particle of each front realization ( see fig .",

    "then for @xmath54 , it is easily seen that the dominant contribution to @xmath5 comes from the wavevector in the neighbourhood of zero , yielding @xcite @xmath55}{\\sqrt{4\\pi d_f\\delta t}}\\ , .",

    "one considers a system of @xmath8 clocks with integer readings @xmath58 .",
    "the dynamics of the clocks involve binary `` collisions '' between any two randomly chosen clocks in continuous time . in a collision between two clocks with pre - collisional readings @xmath11 and @xmath59 ,",

    "a one - dimensional lattice , the number of clocks @xmath61 with readings @xmath21 or higher for any realization of the clock model admits a fluctuating ( and propagating ) front solution @xcite .",
    "clock model allows more than one clock with the same reading and hence the model is bosonic .",
    "conventionally , all clock readings in any realization are initially ( i.e. , at @xmath23 ) , taken to be equal to zero  for the propagating front , this corresponds to the step initial condition @xcite .",
    "once again we denote the largest clock reading in any realization at time @xmath0 by @xmath12 .    in the deterministic mean - field limit ,",
    "the propagating front in the clock model is a pulled front @xcite , and if the time is rescaled in order to have the mean collision frequency of a single clock equal to unity , the front propagates with a speed @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "however , due to stochasticity effects associated with discreteness effects of the clocks and their readings , in the limit of asymptotically large @xmath8 , the front speed @xmath63 and front diffusion coefficient @xmath64 , which could be measured following the procedure described in the last paragraph of sec .",

    "notice that the procedure that we followed to obtain @xmath116 and @xmath117 [ and subsequently the numerical curve for @xmath5 ] at the above time instants does not guarantee @xmath124 and @xmath125 ^ 2\\rangle\\equiv\\sigma_0 ^ 2(t)$ ] ; instead , the @xmath126 and the @xmath125 ^ 2\\rangle/\\sigma_0 ^ 2(t)$ ] values are in fact very close to zero and unity respectively .",

    "[ fig3 ] that the dotted curve is positively skewed ; direct measurement of the third cumulant from the data also confirms this positive skewness behaviour of @xmath5 .",
    "the most noteworthy feature is the longer right tail of the collapsed data than the left tail , implying that the probability for large positive deviation around the mean for the clock model is larger than that of large negative deviation .",
    "this is indeed consistent with positively skewed @xmath5  as stated before , @xmath127 for all snapshots .",
    "while fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] certainly provides an example of deviation from gaussian statistics when the fluctuating front propagation is seen as a correlated extreme value problem , it also provides an interesting perspective from the point of view of fluctuating front propagation literature .",
    "as already mentioned before , clock model is an example of fluctuating `` pulled '' fronts , and the expression for @xmath63 and the scaling for @xmath64 due to the discrete particle stochasticity effects in the limit of asymptotically large values of @xmath8 are known for the last few years .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] however shows that the information regarding the second moment is clearly not enough to characterize @xmath5 .",

    "the statement that `` the front wandering is diffusive '' at any value of @xmath8 for the clock model , therefore , has to be interpreted only in the sense that the second moment of @xmath5 increases linearly with time at large @xmath0 for any value of @xmath8 .    whether the deviation of the dotted line from the gaussian is due to",
    "the fact that we have not used extremely large values of @xmath8 is however not clear .",
    "it is well known that to observe the @xmath131 scaling of @xmath132 and the @xmath133 scaling of @xmath64 for fluctuating `` pulled '' fronts one needs to take @xmath8 extremely high @xcite .",

    "the existing simulation methods at much higher values of @xmath8 are not only quite intricate , but they also do not follow the exact dynamics of the model for all clocks .",
    "this particular point , therefore , is left here for further investigation in future .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed front propagation in discrete particle systems on a one - dimensional lattice as extreme value problems . in these systems",
    ", the positions of the particles can be thought of as random variables , and these random variables under consideration are obviously strongly correlated with each other .",
    "we have seen that in the case of the fermionic reaction - diffusion model , the extreme value problem follows gaussian statistics .",
    "it clearly does not belong to any of the classes pertaining to extreme value statistics of uncorrelated random variables . for the ( bosonic ) clock model however",
    ", we see that the extreme value statistics has a small deviation from the gaussian , and additional analysis ( now presented here ) also clearly shows that the probability distribution does not belong to any of the known universality classes for the extreme valus statistics of uncorrelated random variables .",
    "however , due to the unavailability of any analytical tool , the characterization of this distribution has proved elusive .",

    "<S> when @xmath3 are arranged in the ascending order of magnitudes , the instantaneous front position can be denoted by the location of the rightmost particle , i.e. , by the extremal value @xmath4 $ ] . due to interparticle interactions , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 at two different times for a single front realization are naturally not independent of each other , and thus the probability distribution @xmath5 [ based on an ensemble of such front realizations ] describes extreme value statistics for a set of correlated random variables . in view of the fact that exact results for correlated extreme value statistics are rather rare , here </S>",
    "<S> we show that for a fermionic front model in a reaction - diffusion system , @xmath5 is gaussian . in a bosonic front model </S>",
    "<S> however , we observe small deviations from the gaussian . </S>"
