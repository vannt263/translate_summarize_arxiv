    "yamabe constant is a very difficult problem and so it is to understand the yamabe minimizer .",
    "we will then restrict ourselves to functions which depend only on one of the variables , that is , positive smooth functions @xmath102 of one of the factors in the riemannian product @xmath103 .",
    "the scalar curvature of @xmath104 is given by @xmath105    we then introduce the following definition :    for a given riemannian product @xmath106 of constant scalar curvature , we will call the @xmath107yamabe constant to the infimum of the @xmath108yamabe functional restricted to @xmath109",

    "the next point is that the infimum of the yamabe functional restricted to @xmath109 is always achieved .",
    "this is a simple fact , it is essentially the subcritical case of the yamabe problem , but we sketch its proof since we have not seen it in the literature .    [ easy ] let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be closed riemannian manifolds of constant scalar curvature .",
    "then , there exists a positive smooth function @xmath40 on @xmath116 which minimizes the yamabe quotient among all functions on @xmath116 .    without loss of generality",

    "therefore , there exists a subsequence of the @xmath118 which converges weakly in @xmath109 and strongly in @xmath130 to a function @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "now , by the weak convergence in @xmath109 , we have @xmath133 and therefore @xmath134 and since by hlder s inequality @xmath135 we have that @xmath136 , and hence @xmath137 .",
    "it then follows from elliptic regularity that @xmath138 has to be strictly positive and smooth .",
    "note that , for a given riemannian product of constant scalar curvature , we have three associated yamabe constants each producing a constant scalar curvature metric .",
    "the three are equal if the original product is a yamabe metric .",
    "schoen  @xcite ( cf .",
    "kobayashi  @xcite ) gave a fairly complete study of the solutions of the yamabe equation for the manifolds @xmath139 , where @xmath57 and @xmath3 is a positive constant .",
    "he points out that due to the conformal invariance and a theorem of caffarelli  gidas ",
    "spruck @xcite all solutions are functions of @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , he writes down the yamabe equation for a function of @xmath36 . moving to the riemannian universal covering @xmath140",
    ", one has to deal with the ordinary differential equation :    @xmath141    and look for solutions which are @xmath142periodic . note that exactly the same equation shows up",

    ", one can understand all constant scalar curvature metrics which are conformal by a function of @xmath36 to @xmath143 ; the solutions are the same as those for @xmath146 discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "so for @xmath3 close to 1 there is going to be only one solution , and as @xmath3 increases the number of solutions will increase . if @xmath147 , then the @xmath36-yamabe constant of the product will be less than @xmath148 for all @xmath3 and will approach @xmath148 as @xmath3 goes to infinity .",
    "if @xmath149 in the discussion above , the number of solutions will still be the same , but as @xmath3 becomes big the @xmath36yamabe constants of the product will be bigger than @xmath148 .",

    "since the coframe @xmath302 is orthonormal at infinity , then @xmath302 is a parallel orthonormal coframe everywhere on @xmath296 .",
    "this implies that the map @xmath307 is a local isometry , and hence @xmath247 is locally conformally flat on @xmath298 .",
    "this gives a contradiction to lemma  [ weyl ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath288 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "in this section we estimate the behavior of arbitrary @xmath107yamabe constants in terms of the best constants in the gagliardo - nirenberg interpolation inequalities .",
    "let us define the _",
    "@xmath308gagliardo  nirenberg functional _ as @xmath309    [ inv ] the map @xmath310 is invariant under two operations .",
    "first , if @xmath311 is any non - zero constant then @xmath312 .",
    "second , if @xmath313 is a constant and @xmath314 then @xmath315 @xmath316 and @xmath317 therefore , @xmath318 .",
    "let us recall the following definition from the introduction :    [ sob1 ] the @xmath308gagliardo  nirenberg constant is given by @xmath319    [ num ] the constant @xmath62 has already been studied in the literature .",
    "it is the best constant for the classical interpolation inequality due to gagliardo and nirenberg that says that @xmath320 is bounded away from zero ( cf @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that @xmath62 is closely related to the global existence of the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the author showed also that @xmath62 is always attained by a positive function @xmath321 , called a _ ground state solution _ , that should then satisfy the corresponding euler ",
    "lagrange equation @xmath322 ( the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath310 of course involves coefficients depending on @xmath323 , @xmath324 and @xmath325 : one can use the previous remark to normalize the equation as above ) . for any function @xmath326",
    ", one can consider the spherical symmetrization @xmath327 of @xmath40 , that is , the radial function @xmath327 satisfying @xmath328 for any positive @xmath329 .",
    "it is a classical result that @xmath330 if @xmath331 .",
    "it follows that @xmath332 should be radial and decreasing .",
    "finally , in @xcite it is proved the uniqueness of the positive radial solution of ( [ gss ] ) under the assumption that it vanishes at infinity . the key point to our purposes",
    "is that these facts give a simple procedure to compute numerically all gagliardo  nirenberg constants .",
    "we will continue this discussion on section 6 .",
    "we now relate the gagliardo ",
    "nirenberg constants with the @xmath107yamabe constant of limiting products .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ 1]_. first fix a function @xmath333 and consider the family of functions @xmath334 as in remark [ inv ] .",
    "let us consider the map @xmath335 if we set @xmath336 and @xmath337 then remark [ inv ] implies that @xmath338 .",
    "we see that this map achieves its minimum at @xmath339 and that this minimum is @xmath340 recall that @xmath341 . therefore , @xmath342",
    "we describe now a procedure to determine all gagliardo  nirenberg constants @xmath62 numerically , and how we obtained our table in the introduction .",
    "this equation corresponds to the critical points of the @xmath308gagliardo  nirenberg functional @xmath320 ( see remarks  [ inv ] , [ num ] ) , when restricted to radial functions @xmath347 , which is enough to consider because of symmetrization . by the existence result in @xcite and its uniqueness finally proved in @xcite , there exists only one value @xmath348 that gives a positive solution @xmath349 that vanishes at infinity , called the _",
    "ground state_. to find @xmath350 numerically , we use @xcite where it is shown that , for values @xmath351 , the solution @xmath352 vanishes exactly once and then oscillates about @xmath353 ( figure  1 ) , while , for values @xmath354 , it is positive and oscillatory about the value @xmath303 ( figure  2 ) .        a key point is the uniqueness of the solution of ( [ ode ] ) when the initial value condition @xmath355 is replaced by the boundary condition @xmath356 , for @xmath357 $ ] , and the fact that this solution has @xmath358 in @xmath359 $ ] ; see lemmas 9 , 11 and theorem in @xcite . finally , by @xcite we have that @xmath360 .",
    "for example , we can then compute @xmath361 for the ground state initial value , and hence @xmath362 .",
    "in fact , figure 1 corresponds to @xmath363 and @xmath364 , while figure  2 to @xmath365 .    of course",
    ", if one wants to avoid the numerical computation , one could give estimates for @xmath62 by carefully choosing functions .",
    "for instance we can show that @xmath366 . by considering the function @xmath367",
    "that linearly interpolates the following data : @xmath368 @xmath369 @xmath370 @xmath371 @xmath372 @xmath373 @xmath374 @xmath375 , @xmath376 @xmath377 @xmath378 @xmath379 @xmath380 @xmath381 @xmath382 @xmath383 @xmath384 @xmath385 @xmath386 @xmath387 @xmath388 and @xmath389 , for @xmath390",
