    "an endemic difficulty in unified gauge models is the understanding of fermion masses .",
    "thanks to the brilliant series of experiments which led to the discovery of neutrino oscillations over the past ten years or so , we now have an improved knowledge of neutrino masses and mixings  @xcite . the maximal atmospheric mixing angle and",
    "the large solar mixing angle both came as a surprise , at odds with naive unification  based expectations that lepton and quark mixings are similar . indeed , although not mandatory , within unification models a similar structure for quark and lepton mixing is far easier to account for than what is currently established by observation .",
    "several approaches have been considered in the literature to circumvent this problem , involving various types of extensions of the multiplet content  @xcite .",
    "a virtue of seesaw models is that they bring the possibility of decoupling the angles in the quark and lepton sectors by having additional majorana - type terms for the latter  @xcite .",
    "moreover , seesaw models may account for the observed cosmological baryon excess through the elegant mechanism called leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "however in minimal supergravity models , with @xmath0 100 gev to 10 tev the supersymmetric type - i seesaw scenario leads to an overproduction of gravitinos after inflation  @xcite unless the reheat temperature is restricted to be much lower than that required for successful leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "one possible way out is resonant leptogenesis  @xcite as indeed suggested in ref .",
    "another alternative has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite requires going beyond the minimal seesaw by adding a small r - parity violating term in the superpotential .",
    "here we consider an alternative approach to supersymmetric 0 unification that involves mainly an extension of the lepton sector and a novel realization of the seesaw mechanism already discussed previously  @xcite .",
    "we show how the observed structure of lepton masses and mixings fits together , thanks to the presence of the extra states , with the requirements of a predictive pattern of quark mixing , encoded within the successful fritzsch ansatz  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we show explicitly how such extended supersymmetric 0 seesaw scheme provides a realistic scenario for thermal leptogenesis , avoiding the so - called gravitino problem .",
    "our approach is phenomenological in sipirit .",
    "hence we do not seek to derive a full - fledged unified theory of flavour incorporating a specific symmetry , such as @xmath1  @xcite to the unified gauge group level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we show that leptogenesis scenario is consistent both with the reheat temperature constraint as well as with fitting the lepton and quark mixing angles within the successful fritzsch ansatz .",
    "in the most general seesaw model the dirac fermion mass terms arise from the couplings of the * 16 * with the * 10 * and * 126 * , while the diagonal entries in the seesaw neutrino mass matrix arise only from the couplings of the * 16 * with the * 126*. the mass matrix expressed in the basis is @xmath2 , @xmath3 is given as  @xcite , @xmath4 where the * 16 * denotes each chiral matter generation while the * 10 * and * 126 * are higgs - type chiral multiplets . here",

    "before we display our proposed model it is useful to consider the case of the minimal type - i seesaw  @xcite .",
    "this consists in taking @xmath13 in the above equations . although not generally consistent with 0 in the presence of the * 126 * , this approximation is suitable for our purposes as the extension we will be discussing is tripletless , the * 126 * being replaced by * 16 * s .",

    "however , in a unified theory where a flavour symmetry is assumed to predict the lepton mixing angles , it becomes a real challenge to account naturally also for the quark mixing angles .",
    "now we turn to cosmology .",
    "one of the attractive features of seesaw models is that they open the possibility of accounting for the observed cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe through the leptogenesis mechanism  @xcite .",

    "their rate of production can be so large that subsequent gravitino decays completely change the standard bbn scenario .",
    "since the abundance of gravitinos is proportional to @xmath38 such `` gravitino crisis '' can only be prevented by requiring a low enough reheat temperature @xmath38 after inflation  @xcite .",
    "a recent detailed analysis gives a stringent upper bound @xmath39 when the gravitino has hadronic decay modes  @xcite .",

    "gauge couplings unification can not fix the b - l breaking scale , which can be relatively low , as shown in ref .",

    "for the same reason , @xmath44 can not couple to @xmath46 , but a bare mass is allowed  @xcite . as we will show",

    "the third constraint comes from the fact that the @xmath46 decays have to take place at a time early enough that the sm sphalerons are still in equilibrium , otherwise we will produce a lepton number , but no non - zero baryon number .",

    "+    before we close this section let us briefly illustrate possible values for the relevant parameters .",
    "these are @xmath218 , the masses @xmath219 of the three iso - singlet neutrinos and the resulting baryon asymmetry @xmath193 .",
    "some examples are given in table  [ tab : example ] for each of the scenarios we have discussed .",
    "as one can see the acceptable baryon asymmetry may arise for rather low scales , in contrast to the ( simpler ) seesaw type - i schemes . note , however that the values given in the table are by no means unique , and are also not meant to be `` representative '' of the classes .",
    "the generation of the baryon asymmetry is far easier in this context than in the traditionl seesaw model .",
    "the presence of the new singlets allows us to have , in addition , acceptable textures for the quark and lepton mixing angles .",
    "we have reviewed the argument that in minimal type - i 0 seesaw one can not easily reconcile the thermal leptogenesis scenario with the successful fritzsch texture for the quarks and an acceptable pattern of lepton masses and mixings that follow from neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "this is due to the fact that the large seesaw scale needed to account for small neutrino masses leads to an overproduction of cosmological gravitinos , which destroys the standard predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . barring the very special case of resonant leptogenesis",
    ", one must go beyond the minimal type - i seesaw mechanism .    in this paper",
    "we have studied in some detail an extended seesaw scenario as a natural way to overcome this limitation .",
    "the proposed extension has the added virtue of providing a natural setting for reconciling the observed structure of neutrino mixing angles with the strong hierarchy among quark masses and the smallness of the quark mixings .",
    "while this can always be accommodated in a `` generic '' unified theory with arbitrary multiplet content , it becomes a real challenge for unified predictive models of flavour .",
    "we have provided a quantitative study of fermion masses and ( an approximative calculation of ) leptogenesis in the context of supersymmetric 0 unification .",
    "our approach was phenomenological in that we have not assumed a specific flavour symmetry .",
    "we have shown how thermal leptogenesis can occur at relatively low scale through the decay of a new singlet , thereby avoiding the gravitino crisis .",
    "washout of the asymmetry is effectively suppressed by the absence of direct couplings of the singlet to leptons . for illustration",
    "we have shown how one can accommodate current oscillation neutrino data and the required value for the asymmetry for successful leptogenesis even if the only source of cp violation is the dirac phase @xmath220 in the low energy neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "finally , we note that we have not taken into account flavour effects @xcite in the calculation of the asymmetry .",
    "however , we believe that the absence of a lower bound on @xmath133 in our model is independent on whether flavour effects are taken into account or not .    using the fritzsch texture we have found that some ansatze lead to acceptable values of the asymmetry of order @xmath168-@xmath169 only for large values of @xmath134 and @xmath135 . therefore , these scenarios can be potentially probed by the future neutrino oscillation measurements ,",
    "as the required value of the cp invariant is nearly maximal .",
    "in contrast , we have also presented alternative fritzsch - type ansatze leading to substantially larger values of the cp asymmetry , even for very small values of @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we have also discussed , how to approximately treat the conversion of the decay asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry , without resorting to a full numerical solution of the boltzmann equations . to this end , we made use of some approximation formulas derived previously for seesaw type - i and discussed how they can be adapted to cover also our more complicated case .    in summary , our extended seesaw scenario provides a way of reconciling the lepton and quark mixing angles with thernal leptogenesis in a unified scenario .",
    "while this by itself does not constitute a complete theory of fermion masses and leptogenesis , at least it provides a useful first step towards an ultimate unified theory incorporating flavour .",
