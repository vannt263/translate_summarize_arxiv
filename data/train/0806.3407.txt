    "one of the most important goals in the field of superconductivity is to recognize the properties favorable for pushing the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 to ever higher values . a material which superconducts at or above room temperature",
    "would likely have a lasting impact on current technology . the vast majority of known superconducting materials exhibit @xmath2 s below 10 k , including all elemental superconductors at ambient pressure @xcite , as seen in fig .",
    "1 . values of @xmath2 at or above 20 k have been found only for the cuprate @xcite and fe - based oxides @xcite , nb@xmath4ge @xcite , mgb@xmath5 @xcite , rb@xmath4c@xmath6 @xcite@xmath7 possibly cs@xmath4c@xmath6 @xcite , and , under extreme pressures , for the elemental metals ca @xcite and y @xcite . whereas the high-@xmath2 oxides , which superconduct at temperatures as high as 134 k under ambient conditions ( hgba@xmath5ca@xmath5cu@xmath4o@xmath8 ) @xcite , are generally believed to benefit from a non - phononic pairing interaction @xcite , the other members of the above 20k - or - above group likely exhibit conventional electron - phonon pairing .",
    "whatever the nature of the pairing , it is important to establish the conditions favorable for maximizing @xmath2 .    high pressure is a particularly valuable tool for identifying systematics in a given physical phenomenon , such as superconductivity or magnetism , since it generates changes in the physical properties of a single sample in a controlled manner .",
    "for example , in a simple - metal superconductor such as al , in , sn , or pb , where the conduction band is made up of @xmath9 electrons , @xmath2 is always found to _ decrease _ initially under pressure @xcite .",
    "in fact , this result was observed for sn by sizoo and onnes in 1925  @xcite in the first high - pressure experiment ever carried out on a superconductor ; they concluded that ... a relatively large space between the atoms is favourable for the appearing of the supraconductive state .... it is , therefore , surprising that @xmath10 is strongly positive for the simple metals li @xcite and ca @xcite if they are subjected to pressures in the range above 20 gpa . in superconductors containing transition metals , where _ d_-electrons dominate the conduction band properties , @xmath2 can initially rise or fall under pressure and exhibit a highly nonlinear @xmath3 dependence at higher pressures ( see , for example , refs .",

    "the relative increase in @xmath14 with pressure is particularly large for the early  transition metals where @xmath14 is small , we focus our attention first on the four trivalent @xmath1-electron metals sc , y , la , and lu , of which only la superconducts at ambient pressure .",

    "a temperature - dependent background signal @xmath39 is subtracted from the measured susceptibility data ; @xmath40 is obtained by measuring at pressures too low to induce superconductivity over the temperature range 5 - 50 k. this lower limit in the effective temperature range is not dictated by the cryostat , which can cool to 1.55 k , but by the fact that the superconductivity of the w - re gasket leads to a large diamagnetic signal which swamps the sample signal below @xmath24 5.2 k , a temperature which has negligible pressure dependence . for this reason the superconducting transition of the sample can only be reliably detected if it occurs at a temperature @xmath41 k. a relatively low noise level of a few tenths of a nanovolt is achieved by : ( a ) using the transformer preamplifier to ensure good impedance matching , ( b ) varying the temperature very slowly ( 100  mk / min ) at low temperatures , ( c ) using a long time constant ( @xmath42 3 s ) on the lock - in amplifier , and ( d ) averaging over 2 - 3 measurements .",

    "such an extrapolation yields an estimated sample pressure of 220 gpa for @xmath60 80 bar . to check the validity of this extrapolation , we measured the diamond vibron in the raman scattering ( fig .",
    "2b ) at the maximum pressure , as described above , which yielded ` only ' 174 gpa .",
    "the simple extrapolation from @xmath60 45 to 80 bar thus overestimated the sample pressure in the cell by more than 40 gpa .",

    ", the magnitude of the diamagnetic transition for lu is seen to become  noticeably smaller with increasing field .",
    "this likely arises since the applied field , which is enhanced by the factor @xmath65 at the outer perimeter of the pancake - shaped sample , is sufficiently strong for @xmath66 to exceed the critical field and penetrate into the outer perimeter of the sample , thus reducing the effective sample diameter @xmath67 and sample volume @xmath68 in fact , from the relative change in the magnitude of the superconducting transition in the applied magnetic field seen in fig .  4c , one can estimate @xcite the critical field at 0 k and 140 gpa for lu to be @xmath69(0 k@xmath70 oe .    in contrast , as seen in fig .",
    "3a for sc at 102 gpa , there is no measurable decrease in the magnitude of @xmath71 in 500 oe magnetic field .",

    "skriver and mertig @xcite calculated the strength of the electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath96 at ambient pressure , obtaining for sc , y , la , and lu the values 0.57 , 0.53 , 0.90 , and 0.59 , respectively .",
    "note that the only ambient - pressure superconductor in the group , la , has a much higher calculated value of @xmath96 than the other three",
    ".    it would be useful if a single state - of - the - art electronic structure calculation of the properties relevant for superconductivity would be carried out for sc , y , la , and lu to pressures into the mbar region .",
    "because of the close electronic similarity of these four systems , much could be learned about the efficacy of this type of calculation for predicting superconducting properties in general .      as mentioned in the introduction , the equilibrium crystal structure under ambient conditions across the 3@xmath1 , 4@xmath1 , and 5@xmath1 transition metal series , as well as across the rare - earth series from la to lu ,",
    "has been shown to be closely related to the occupancy of the @xmath1-band @xmath13 we now explore the question whether in @xmath1-electron metals the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 might itself be correlated with @xmath116 restricting ourselves here to the four electronically closely related trivalent @xmath1-electron metals sc , y , la , and lu .",
    "the @xmath1-electron count @xmath14 increases under pressure due to @xmath117 transfer which is driven by the increase in the fractional ion core volume @xmath118 @xcite , where we define the ion core volume @xmath119 and the atomic volume @xmath120 ( @xmath121 is the wigner - seitz radius ) , yielding @xmath122 the conduction electrons must stay out of the ion core volume @xmath123 and thus are confined to the free sample volume @xmath124 outside the ion cores . under pressure",
    "the atomic volume @xmath125 decreases whereas @xmath123 remains nearly constant .",
    "the ratio @xmath126 therefore , is a measure of how much free volume remains for the conduction electrons under pressure .",
    "the ratio @xmath127 decreases under pressure ; the closer it approaches the minimum possible value 1 , the less free volume is available and the greater the anticipated degree of @xmath128 transfer @xcite .    many years ago",
    "johansson and rosengren @xcite showed that the @xmath2 values for y , la , lu , and alloys thereof are a smooth function of a similar ratio @xcite which decreases under pressure , as does @xmath2 .",
    "we pursue a similar analysis here where @xmath121 at ambient pressure is calculated from the molar volume and @xmath129 is obtained from the trivalent ionic radii for coordination number 6 @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath130 is independent of pressure so that applying high pressure monotonically _ decreases _ the value of the ratio @xmath127 . to determine how @xmath127 changes at high pressure , we simply multiply it by @xmath131 where @xmath81 is given by the equations of state for sc , y , la , and lu cited above .    in fig .",
    "6 we plot @xmath2 versus @xmath127 for sc , y , la , and lu .",
    "one sees immediately that the data for these four metals are more tightly grouped together than in the previous figures where @xmath2 was plotted versus pressure @xmath132 or relative volume @xmath133 the ratio @xmath127 , therefore , appears to be a more relevant parameter to describe the superconducting properties than @xmath132 or @xmath133 some simple systematics are evident in fig .",
    "initially , at least , @xmath2 generally increases with pressure .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath2 values of all four elements do not exceed 1 k until the ratio @xmath127 is reduced to a value below @xmath24 2.1 .",
    "this clarifies why la is the only member in this group that is superconducting at ambient pressure ; for la at ambient pressure @xmath134 , whereas for the other three metals @xmath135 ( see vertical arrows below upper axis in fig .",
    "6 ) .    under pressure the @xmath1-electron",
    "count @xmath14 for sc , y , la , and lu increases @xcite .",
    "duthie and pettifor @xcite and pettifor @xcite have shown that the occupation of the @xmath1-band is closely related to the fractional volume of the ion core with smaller relative volumes leading to greater occupation of the @xmath1-band .",
    "the effect of compression on the @xmath1-band occupancy has been recently calculated for sc , y , la , and lu by yin and pickett @xcite and is shown in fig .",
    "7a where @xmath14 is plotted versus @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath14 increases monotonically with pressure ( decreasing @xmath136 , being largest for la metal over almost the entire range .",
    "fig  7b shows that for sc , y , and la the ratio @xmath127 has nearly a one - to - one correspondence with the calculated @xmath1-electron count @xmath14 , the dependence for lu being shifted towards lesser @xmath14 values .    in fig .",
    "8 the data in figs .",
    "5b and 7a are used to plot @xmath2 versus @xmath14 for all four metals .",
    "compared to the data in fig .  6 , where @xmath2 is plotted versus the ratio @xmath127 , the curves for y , la , and lu do appear to be grouped closer together , but that for sc has moved somewhat further away .",
    "it is thus not clear whether the ratio @xmath127 or the @xmath67-electron count @xmath14 is the superior parameter for describing changes in the superconducing properties under pressure .",
    "since @xmath2 generally increases with @xmath116 one expects that when the @xmath1 occupation reaches its maximum value @xmath137 the pressure dependence of @xmath2 should change , perhaps passing through a maximum . according to fig .",
    "7b , however , the principal maximum in @xmath3 for la occurs at a value @xmath138 which is well below @xmath139 .",
    "sc , being the least compressible and having the largest ambient pressure value of @xmath126 is the farthest from completion of @xmath128 transfer in the present experiment .",
    "indeed , the data for sc in fig .",
    "7b would imply that it would take a pressure much higher than 2 mbar before @xmath128 transfer is completed .",
    "this suggests that , had the structural phase transition in sc at 110 gpa not occurred , @xmath2 might have reached values near 30 k according to an estimate using the phenomenological model above .",
    "the sc - ii phase , in which sc exhibits its highest value @xmath140 k , the second highest behind ca @xcite for any elemental superconductor , is an unusual incommensurate host - guest crystal structure @xcite .",
    "this type of crystal structure was only recently found to exist in high pressure phases of elemental solids @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to study these metals to much higher pressures in order to investigate to what heights @xmath2 for sc and lu will increase . in view of its light molecular weight and exceptionally high value of @xmath2 , ultra - high pressure experiments on sc are particularly promising .",
    "in addition , sc undergoes a further structural transition to sc - iv at 130 gpa @xcite which may well leave its mark on the superconducting properties .",
