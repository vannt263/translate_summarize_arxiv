    "pressure - induced amorphization ( pia ) and amorphous - amorphous transition ( aat ) , as well as liquid - liquid transition ( llt ) , are fundamentally interesting and widely studied phenomena occurring in some common materials @xcite .",
    "especially interesting is the existence of polyamorphism , both in the solid regime - aat , as observed in h@xmath0o , sio@xmath0 , geo@xmath0 @xcite , si @xcite , ge @xcite , s @xcite or c @xcite and in the liquid state - llt , as reported experimentally in p @xcite and s @xcite ( and disputed in n @xcite ) or predicted theoretically for c @xcite and h @xcite .",
    "recently , carbon dioxide has been found to enrich this class of materials for observing the aat between extended a - carbonia and molecular amorphous forms @xcite and also for prediction of llt between molecular and polymeric liquids @xcite .",
    "carbon dioxide is one of the most important compounds found on earth and in the solar system , which plays a crucial role in planetary atmospheres and influences also dynamics of their interiors . at the same time ,",
    "crystallography and high - pressure behavior of co@xmath0 are nontrivial and attracted a lot of attention in the last 15 years leaving some topics still unresolved ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the exact structure of ( pseudo - sixfold ) phase - vi ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , intermediate character and possible presence of bent molecules in phases ii , iv and iii - see @xcite , for example , are still matter of debate . the high-@xmath1-@xmath2 regime of co@xmath0 is also disputed as far as several experiments and theoretical works often led to conflicting results @xcite .",
    "a liquid - liquid - solid triple point was recently proposed to exist inside the earth s geotherm region as well @xcite .",
    "the lowest pressure solid molecular phase of co@xmath0 , present on surface of icy caps of mars , is known as dry ice - phase - i .",
    "this quadrupolar @xmath3 structure transforms between 12 - 18 gpa into @xmath4 phase - iii @xcite with molecules aligned in planes , which on further compression transforms into tetrahedral phase - v @xcite , recently identified as @xmath5-cristobalite @xmath6 structure @xcite ( though existence of a tridymite - like @xmath7 structure at similar conditions is was also proposed @xcite ) .",
    "other stable phases of co@xmath0 include molecular phases ii @xcite , iv @xcite and vii @xcite , polymeric phase - vi @xcite and other newly discovered forms - possibly polymeric phase - viii @xcite , two tetrahedral structures of coesite - i ( phase - ixa ) and coesite - ii ( phase - ixb ) @xcite and ionic phase @xmath8-co@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a specific property of phase - v ( and all tetrahedral structures of co@xmath0 ) is extreme rigidity of intertetrahedral c - o - c angle that is represented by energy calculations of @xmath6 phase @xcite and h@xmath9c@xmath0o@xmath10 molecule @xcite , which both show a dramatic increase in energy with variation of the angle out of deep minimum placed near 125@xmath11 .",
    "this behavior is in a sharp contrast with sio@xmath0 , where the minimum is shallow and allows silica to form a rich variety of @xmath12-polymorphs @xcite unlike the situation in co@xmath0 .",
    "high stability of tetrahedral over possible octahedral structures in co@xmath0 is also obvious and might be connected to small size of carbon atoms that allow them to occupy interstitial sites of the close - packed oxygen sublattice @xcite .",
    "stiff c - o - c angle is directly connected also to low compressibility of tetrahedral co@xmath0 . as far as double c = o",
    "bond is one of the most stable chemical bonds , molecules sustain large overpressurization before they break and initiate transformation into a single - bonded network .",
    "molecular phase - iii hence persists to ( 60 gpa , 300 k ) and to ( 40 gpa , 1800 k ) @xcite , though the equilibrium transition pressure is according to recent experiment @xcite and enthalpy calculations @xcite only around 20 gpa .",
    "the molecular - to - nonmolecular transition is therefore associated with high free energy barriers that lead to negative slope of ( kinetic ) transition line @xcite and possibly also to amorphization at low and moderate temperatures when system is not able to complete the transition and remains stuck in a disordered state .",
    "sio@xmath0 and geo@xmath0 are archetypal glass - forming materials exhibiting low and high density tetrahedral amorphous forms ( lda and hda ) as well as octahedral forms and forms containing fivefold coordinations @xcite .",
    "the first prediction of tetrahedra - based amorphous co@xmath0 was based on @xmath13 @xmath14 molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in the work of serra @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite in 1999 and the first observation of amorphous co@xmath0 was reported two years later @xcite .",
    "it was suggested from the raman spectra that the extended amorphous solid is formed by a mixture of three - coordinated ( @xmath17 ) and four - coordinated ( @xmath18 ) carbon atoms @xcite , which would be a novel property amongst the group - iv dioxides .",
    "synthesis of a - co@xmath0 was also reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the further experiments , santoro @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite suggested from raman spectra that amorphous polymeric form of co@xmath0 , named  a - carbonia ",
    ", is a glassy counterpart of phase - v and is also similar to tetrahedral a - silica .",
    "another experimental study was performed at room temperature by kume @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite and a - carbonia was proposed to be related to phase - vi . in these experiments , a - carbonia was decompressed to ambient conditions and a transformation into a molecular amorphous form was observed - at 16 gpa @xcite and below 30 gpa @xcite .",
    "amorphization in the higher @xmath1 region was observed on further compression of phases v , vi and coesite - co@xmath0 over 1 mbar @xcite .",
    "amorphous co@xmath0 was studied also by first principles simulations ( md @xcite and metadynamics @xcite ) , which confirmed the picture of mixed three and fourfold nature of a - carbonia , while in both references roughly equal number of @xmath17 and @xmath18 atoms was reported .",
    "recent @xmath13 @xmath14 calculations proposed also existence of a first - order llt between molecular and polymeric liquids @xcite - the polymeric liquid is formed from the molecular one starting as predominantly @xmath17 but evolves upon compression to @xmath18-dominated liquid form .",
    "the experimental and theoretical works leave several questions about amorphous carbon dioxide open .",
    "in particular , what is the actual structure of a - carbonia - what is the stable ratio of @xmath17 and @xmath18 carbons ( 3 - 4 ratio ) at different pressures and what is the structural relation between a - carbonia and crystalline co@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , how the structural evolution from a - carbonia to the molecular amorphous form proceeds and what exactly happens upon ( de)compression - if the transformations are continuous or discontinuous and whether molecules can eventually coexist with the polymeric form . in this paper",
    ", we aim at resolving these questions using _ ab initio _ md .    the paper is organized as follows . in part ii , we describe methods and main findings of our simulations that are analyzed in part iii .",
    "the analysis includes investigation of structural properties of polymeric amorphous forms and mixed molecular - polymeric form and their possible relations to crystalline phases .",
    "next , mechanical stability of the observed forms is analyzed and compared .",
    "finally , enthalpies , compressibilities , electronic properties and structure factors of all forms are calculated and discussed .",
    "finally , we summarize our observations and suggestions for further study in the conclusions .",
    "we used standard density functional theory ( dft ) based codes vasp 4 and 5 @xcite . to simulate systems under constant pressure with vasp 4 version , we employed slightly modified berendsen algorithm @xcite where cell parameters and atomic positions and velocities were rescaled according to difference of external and internal stress tensor every 20 md timesteps ( more details",
    "are described in ref .",
    "simulations performed with newer versions of vasp 5 were carried out with the implemented parrinello - rahman ( pr ) barostat @xcite working together with the langevin thermostat generating the @xmath19 ensemble .",
    "paw pseudopotentials and the pbe functional @xcite were used to describe four / six valence electrons for each carbon / oxygen atom , using energy cutoff 450 ev and @xmath20-point sampling of the brillouin zone .    .",
    "starting from phase - iii ( black dots and arrows ) at 50 gpa and 1000 k , pia was observed at 100 gpa - event-1 ( e1 ) leading to formation of polymeric a - carbonia form denoted as _ a-1 _ ( blue squares and arrows ) .",
    "decompression at 500 k led to creation of another version of polymeric a - carbonia _ a-2 _ ( green squares ) - event-2 ( e2 ) and on further pressure drop _ a-3 _ ( red squares ) was formed at 5 gpa - event e3 .",

    "[ fig : protocol ] ) .",
    "sample amorphized upon compression from ( 90 gpa , 1000 k ) to ( 100 gpa , 1500 k ) similarly to previous dft simulations @xcite .",
    "the resulting polymeric a - carbonia form ( blue ) , which we denote as _ a-1 _ here , was dominated by @xmath18 carbons ( co@xmath21 tetrahedras ) . from this point",
    ", we started decompression at temperature of 500 k in order to study the evolution of the amorphous state .",
    "after bringing system to 20 gpa , _",
    "a-1 _ was transformed to a different polymeric form with similar proportion of @xmath17 and @xmath18 carbons - _ a-2 _ ( green ) .",
    "amorphous forms _ a-1 _ and _ a-2 _ appear in our simulations as two limiting ( high and low pressure ) realizations of polymeric a - carbonia because they transform into each other gradually between 20 and 45 gpa as observed in separate calculations shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol ] inset .",
    "afterwards , we proceeded with decompression along two separate pathways - at 500 k and at 200 k. branch decompression and all other calculations were calculated with vasp 5 and pr barostat . ] in the 500 k branch we observed a formation of mixed molecular - polymeric form - _ a-3 _ ( red ) at 5 gpa , while the same form appeared also in the lower 200 k branch at 0 gpa .",
    "the two independent kinetic pathways leading to the same amorphous form - with equal proportion of coordinations , suggest that _",
    "a-3 _ form is not a mere artifact of the simulation timescale , but instead a form with pronounced metastability .",
    "this is further supported by stability of _",

    "completely depolymerized into a molecular state ( black ) , which behaved like gas at the simulation temperature of 500 k ( therefore denoted as amorphous - gaseous transition - agt on fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol ] ) and solidified to molecular amorphous form at 200 k. the total simulation time of our 324 atomic system exceeds 1 ns .",
    "to characterize the various amorphous forms , we analyzed proportion of different carbon coordinations . on fig .",

    "a-2_. the forms are limiting forms of polymeric a - carbonia in the sense that further compression of _",

    "amorphization occurs very fast upon the compression to 100 gpa and is accompanied by a large volume collapse and complete structural reorganization . from the distribution of intramolecular o = c = o angles , we observed that molecules always remained linear lacking any systematic bending before the onset of amorphization .",

    "one can see from the figures clearly that all broad peaks of _ a-1 _ well cover the corresponding sharp peaks of phase - v .",

    "compared to the polymeric forms the mixed a-3 form appears to have pronounced metastability which can be related to different distribution of certain interatomic distances and bond lengths . due to the large gap between the timescale of experiments and simulations",
