    "biological evolution and ecology involve nonlinear interactions between large numbers of units and have recently become popular topics among statistical and computational physicists @xcite . however , many models used by physicists are unrealistic to the extent of attracting little attention from biologists . here",
    ", we introduce a somewhat more realistic model of the dynamics of a predator - prey system and explore some aspects of the resulting food - web structures .",
    "recently , we developed simplified models of biological macroevolution @xcite , in which the reproduction rates in an individual - based population dynamics with nonoverlapping generations provide the mechanism for selection between several interacting species .",
    "new species enter the community through point mutations in a haploid , binary  genome \" of length @xmath0 .",
    "the potential species are identified by the index @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "( typically , only @xmath2 species are present in the community at any time @xmath3 . ) at the end of each generation , each individual of species @xmath4 gives birth to a fixed number @xmath5 of offspring with probability @xmath6 before dying , or dies without offspring with probability @xmath7",
    ". each offspring may mutate into a different species with a small probability @xmath8 .",
    "mutation consists in flipping a randomly chosen bit in the genome .    here",
    ", we consider a model with modified population dynamics that include competition between different predators that prey on the same species , as well as a satiation effect for predators with abundant prey .",
    "consistent with our previous work @xcite , the central quantity of the model is an _ antisymmetric interaction matrix _",
    "@xmath9 representing predator - prey interactions .",
    "thus , @xmath10 and @xmath11 means that @xmath4 is a predator and @xmath12 its prey , and vice versa .",
    "the elements of the upper triangle of @xmath9 are drawn randomly from a symmetric distribution over @xmath13 $ ] and kept constant during the whole simulation ( quenched randomness ) . a constant ,",
    "@xmath14 , represents an external resource .",
    "the ability of species @xmath4 to utilize @xmath15 is @xmath16 , which with probability @xmath17 is chosen to be a random number uniform on @xmath18 $ ] ( i.e. , @xmath19 is the proportion of potential producer species )",
    ". species with @xmath20 are consumers .",
    "the population size of species @xmath4 is @xmath21 .",
    "interspecies competition is modeled by defining the number of individuals of species @xmath12 that are available as prey for @xmath4 , corrected for competition from other predator species , as @xmath22 where @xmath23 runs over all @xmath0 such that @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 .",
    "analogously , we define the competition - adjusted external resources available to a producer species @xmath4 as @xmath26 . with these definitions , the total , competition - adjusted resources available to species @xmath4 are @xmath27 where @xmath28 runs over all @xmath12 such that @xmath10 .",
    "the _ functional response _ of species @xmath4 with respect to @xmath12 , @xmath29 , is the rate at which an individual of species @xmath4 consumes individuals of @xmath12 @xcite . for ecosystems consisting of a single pair of predator and prey , or a simple chain from a bottom - level producer through intermediate species to a top predator ,",
    "the most common forms of functional response are due to holling @xcite . for more complicated food webs ,",
    "several functional forms have been proposed recently , @xcite but there is as yet no agreement about a standard form . here ,",
    "we model intraspecies competition by a ratio - dependent @xcite holling type ii @xcite form due to getz @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 $ ] is the metabolic efficiency of converting prey biomass to predator offspring .",
    "analogously , the functional response of a producer species @xmath4 toward the external resource @xmath15 is @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the total consumption rate for an individual of species @xmath4 is therefore @xmath33 the birth probability is assumed to be proportional to the consumption rate , @xmath34 $ ] , while the probability that an individual of @xmath4 avoids death by predation until attempting to reproduce is @xmath35 the reproduction probability for an individual of species @xmath4 is @xmath36 .",
    "+     as the model is defined above , species forage indiscriminately over all available resources , with the output only limited by competition .",
    "also , there is an implication that an individual s total foraging effort increases proportionally with the number of species to which it is connected by a positive @xmath37 .",
    "a more realistic picture would be that an individual s total foraging effort is constant and can either be divided equally , or concentrated on richer resources .",
    "this is known as adaptive foraging .",
    "while one can go to great length devising optimal foraging strategies @xcite , we here only use a simple scheme , in which individuals of @xmath4 show a preference for prey species @xmath12 , based on the interactions and population sizes ( uncorrected for interspecies competition ) and given by @xmath38 and analogously for @xmath15 by @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the total foraging effort is thus @xmath40 .",
    "these preference factors are used to modify the reproduction probabilities by replacing all occurrences of @xmath37 by @xmath41 and of @xmath16 by @xmath42 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : neff ] )  ( [ eq : phiij ] ) .",
    "we simulated the model over @xmath43 generations ( plus @xmath44 generations  warm - up \" ) for the following parameters : @xmath45 ( @xmath46 potential species ) , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , interaction matrix @xmath9 with connectance @xmath51 and nonzero elements with a symmetric , triangular distribution over @xmath13 $ ] , and @xmath52 .",
    "we ran five independent runs , each starting from a population of 100 randomly chosen producer species .",
    "time series of diversities ( effective numbers of species ) and population sizes for one run are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : adap](top ) . to filter out noise from low - population , unsuccessful mutants ,",
    "the diversity is defined as the exponential shannon - wiener index @xcite .",
    "this is the exponential function of the information - theoretical entropy of the population distributions , @xmath53 for the case of all species , and analogously for the producers and consumers separately .    without adaptive foraging ,",
    "the system flips randomly between a phase with a diversity near ten , and a phase of one or a few producer species with a very low population of many unstable consumer species @xcite .",
    "adaptive foraging produces a striking change in the dynamics .",
    "there is now a metastable low - diversity phase , which gives way at a random time to a stable high - diversity phase with much smaller fluctuations . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : adap](top ) , the switch - over is quite abrupt .",
    "a representative community food web is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adap](bottom ) .",
    "this is a  core community , \" extracted from the full community by retaining only species with @xmath54 that also existed 256 generations earlier . here",
    ", every consumer species preys on at least one producer species , thus there are only two trophic levels .",
    "( only links with @xmath55 are included . )",
    "histograms of the correlation coefficient between a species numbers of prey ( indegree ) and predators ( outdegree ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adap2](left ) .",
    "the correlations are strongly negative in both the simulated full and core communities and also in the majority of the 17 empirical communities considered in ref .",
    "these negative correlations are explained by the joint indegree - outdegree distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adap2](right ) : producers ( p ) have low average indegree and high average outdegree , while consumers ( c ) show the opposite behavior .",
    "we have introduced a model for the biological coevolution of predators and prey , based on the ecological concept of functional response . when adaptive foraging is included in the model , it has a dynamically stable phase of relatively high diversity .",
    "the indegree and outdegree of a species are negatively correlated , which is explained by the observation that producers have low indegree and high outdegree , while consumers have high indegree and low outdegree .",
    "our model demonstrates the high degree of complexity that can be produced , even by simple models of biological evolution and ecology .",
