    "violation of local realism is a fascinating phenomenon of quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "since the paradox was presented by einstein , podolsky and rosen@xcite in 1935 , qm was at one time under suspicion until bell@xcite showed that there existed certain settings for physical experiments that contradicted common sense views of reality .",
    "bell s theorem was proved by the experiment@xcite in 1982 and other more later .",
    "nowadays , quantum nonlocality is getting the attention it deserves as another special aspect of the quantum correlations - entanglement .    to get more insight of quantum mechanics",
    ", it makes sense to have a study on the connection between quantum entanglement and quantum nonlocality . like von neumann entropy and concurrence@xcite for entanglement ,",
    "various criteria were put forward to give a convenient test of nonlocality . the earliest one - bell inequality@xcite which comes from bell s theorem gives a criterion that classic local correlation must obey .",
    "numbers of bell - type inequalities@xcite were presented for different systems afterwards .",
    "the violation of bell - type inequality gives a straightforward impression about quantum nonlocal correlations ( qnc ) .",
    "a common feature for all these inequalities is that qm s violation ca nt reach the maximum value .",
    "naturally , popescu and rohrlich@xcite showed a correlation gives a maximal violation 4 of clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality@xcite , while the maximal violation in qm domain , _",
    "i.e. _ tsirelson s bound@xcite @xmath3 by qnc .",
    "similarly , an algebraic maximum 8@xcite and quantum bound @xmath4 by svetlichny inequality@xcite exist in tripartite system . with the addition of the correlations over quantum bound , postquantum correlations ( pqc )",
    ", nonlocal correlations were discussed in generalized nonsignaling models , as nonsignaling correlated boxes@xcite decided by joint probability distribution@xcite .",
    "strong information - theoretic capabilities were revealed in the study of pqc@xcite , such as secure cryptography@xcite and the reduction of communication complexity@xcite .",
    "properties of entanglement , such as monogamy , distillation , and swapping , were proved to be capable for nonlocality in nonsignaling theory@xcite , but distinctions still exist between entanglement and nonlocality .",
    "local operations and classic communication ( locc ) were essential in entanglement distillation processes , but nonlocality distillation occurs without cc@xcite . only the operations on the input and output of nonlocal boxes are crucial to the distillation of nonlocality .",
    "dramatically , the device operating on the outside of the boxes failed to swap the correlation between nonlocal boxes@xcite .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite raised the concept of _ genuine boxes _ and _ coupler _ as analogue of the quantum joint measurement for nonlocality swapping .",
    "clauser - horne ( ch ) inequality@xcite as an appropriate measure of nonlocality was applied to obtain the possibility of successful swapping .",
    "the fact that only pqc can be successfully swapped in isotropic resources makes the emergence of tsirelson s bound under ch expression .",
    "then , skrzypczyk and brunner@xcite considered all theoretically possible couplers , ranging from perfect to minimal couplers , for limited nonlocality , and quantum bound still appeared in their study .",
    "zukowski _ _ et al.__@xcite proposed the first entanglement swapping scheme , and it was soon generalized to the case of generating a three - particle greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state from three bell pairs@xcite .",
    "bose _ _ et al.__@xcite generalized the procedure of entanglement swapping to the multiparticle case . a natural question",
    "whether multipartite nonlocal correlations can be swapped raises to us . exploring the analog of multiparticle entanglement swapping , we ll try to design a generalized multipartite coupler for realizing multipartite nonlocality swapping .    replacing the ch inequality by chsh inequality@xcite and the generalized svetlichny inequality@xcite",
    ", we find that the existing bipartite coupler provides an adequate dynamical process for two correlated nonlocal boxes , including multipartite ones .",
    "but this bipartite - coupler - based swapping consumes much resources and seems less efficient in the case of swapping of multi nonlocal boxes .",
    "then we will show a generalized coupler , which can be applied on many multipartite boxes , makes the swapping of many multipartite boxes succeed in a more efficient way .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[s2 ] we briefly review the quantum nonlocality swapping of two bipartite binary correlated boxes and show the key points therein . in sec.[s3 ] , we define the general multipartite binary correlated boxes after presenting the form of the generalized svetlichny inequality for nonsignal systems . in sec.[s4 ]",
    "we generalize the nonlocality swapping on two bipartite boxes to the case of two multipartite boxes by using the bipartite coupler @xmath0 and give a discussion on the bound of quantum nonlocal correlation . in sec.[s5 ] we attempt to achieve the nonlocality swapping on three bipartite boxes and then we show the multipartite coupler @xmath1 for nonlocality swapping on arbitrary number of multipartite boxes . conclusions and remarks",

    "the output @xmath13 indicates that the correlation between alice and charlie was created successfully .",
    "thus , the whole procedure is expressed as @xmath14    some characteristics for the swapping process were summarized as follows :    a coupler working on the genuine part@xcite of the quantum box but not on the measurement devices , is different from the action in ref.@xcite .",

    "we find that replacing the ch inequality with chsh inequality@xcite is feasible for swapping joint probability - symmetric boxes , including isotropic boxes .",

    "before generalizing the swapping of bipartite nonlocalities to the multipartite case , we need to make some theoretical preparations .    in tripartite system ,",
    "a famous inequality for nonlocality is svetlichny@xcite inequality , and for nonsignaling box @xmath35 it has the form@xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 the box with probability distribution @xmath39 gives the algebraic maximal violation 8 , namely , the svetlichny box ( sb ) , and the ghz state ( @xmath40 ) achieves the quantum maximal violation @xmath4 of svetlichny inequality with an appropriate set of measurements . from the joint probability distribution matrix of ghz",

    "basing on the linearity of the swapping , if all group s correlations are noisy like @xmath120 , the final correlation will be @xmath121 .",
    "the quantum bound only appears in the case where two boxes are noisy or the coupler is @xmath122 .",
    "we found that chsh inequality is also pragmatic for previous nonlocality swapping scheme .",
    "then we focused on the svetlichny inequality in tripartite system , and showed the form of @xmath94-particle svetlichny inequality in multipartite nonsignaling system . basing on this generalized bell - type inequality , we defined the extremal multipartite nonlocal boxes for our generalization of swapping process in the paper .    using the same coupler applied in skrzypczyk s swapping scheme ,",
    "we first presented a generalized swapping of two arbitrary multipartite nonlocal correlations , which could generate a multipartite correlation with more users than the initial ones . later , through a combined scheme , we illustrated that multipartite correlation could also be generated from swapping many bipartite boxes .",
    "for the sake of efficiency , we finally presented a more general multipartite nonlocality swapping scheme with a generalized multipartite coupler , an analogue of quantum joint measurement in multipartite entanglement swapping .",
    "the multipartite coupler builds an efficient device to generate multipartite nonlocal correlation between many users .",
    "the generalized quantum bound always emerges in the scheme of swapping two multipartite isotropic boxes , and occasionally emerges in the process of swapping three or more multipartite boxes .",
    "judged by appearance , the emergence of quantum bound is merely a numerical coincidence , but the mathematical relation between nonlocal criterion ( @xmath123 ) , quantum bound ( @xmath124 ) and extremal violation ( @xmath54 ) is a clue to get a deep understanding of quantum nonlocality .",
    "many open problems are presented in front of us .",
    "the fact that nonlocal correlation only can be generated from swapping the postquantum boxes makes not only an emergence of quantum bound but also a gap between qnc and pqc .",
    "the coupler , as the most important part in swapping process , beyond the device for poor dynamics applied outside the nosigned boxes after measurement , is very likely valuable for some other dynamical processes , individually or combined as the scheme depicted in fig.[62 ] . how to generalize the swapping to high dimensional systems ( multipartite multi - nary boxes ) with suitable inequality is worth to study , too .",
