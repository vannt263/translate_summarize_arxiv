    "strong electronic correlations , competition between localization and itinerancy , mott physics , and low - energy spin excitations are considered key ingredients necessary to explain these anomalous features and the hubbard model @xcite contain all of them by construction .",
    "the hubbard model@xcite together with its relevance to real materials , in particular cuprate high-@xmath0 superconductors , has always raised a more fundamental and theoretical interest as it is universally considered the prototypical model for strongly correlated systems .",

    "this is the result of the peculiar shape of such bands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3_4 ] ) that closely recalls the bending driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations and the simultaneous occupation of @xmath132 and @xmath131 points .",
    "what is really surprising is the fact that the major , almost the only , contribution to the double occupancy ( @xmath143_{m}$ ] ) comes just from the this last region in momentum ( close to @xmath131 point ) .",
    "this is really counterintuitive as one expects those branches of energy - momentum dispersion to have such a shape because of the strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations and to be the main seat of electrons contributing to single occupation and , therefore , with well - formed spin momenta . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath140 close to @xmath131 should be correctly read as the main ( actually the only ) contribution to the kinetic energy coming from the @xmath144 hubbard operators , that is from those electrons moving between double occupied sites .",

    "com(3p ) features an occupation of the cb close to @xmath132 point quite reduced with respect to that sported at @xmath129 , even if we take into account that it is now spanning a quite larger region in momentum and the main anti - diagonal ( the @xmath133 line ) is somewhat filled too .",
    "this can be explained by noting that the lhb , which at @xmath129 was filled only close to @xmath131 point , features now a quite relevant occupation spanning all over the first brillouin zone and , in particular , at the @xmath131 point and along the main anti - diagonal ( the @xmath133 line ) .",

    "accordingly , it is just the cb , which originates from the third basic field describing the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic fluctuations , to bring the larger contribution as one would have expected .",
    "therefore , having such a field in the basis results as one of the main ingredients in order to get such a good performance in comparing this solution with numerical ones @xcite .",
    "com(2p,@xmath117 ) contributions to @xmath141 all come from the only occupied band , the lhb , and once more seem to mime the overall behavior of com(3p ) .",
    "com(2p,@xmath116 ) has a completely different behavior .",
    "in particular , the contribution of the lhb close to the @xmath132 point is quite difficult to understand : instead of increasing in absolute value towards the @xmath132 point , it decreases leading to the presence of a maximum absolute value for a value of momentum that coincide with the fermi surface of the related com(2p,@xmath116 ) uhb .",
    "in this manuscript , we have first recollected the main analytical expressions defining a recently proposed , within the framework of the composite operator method@xcite , three - pole solution for the two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite .",
    "together with the two hubbard fields , well describing the physics at the energy scale of @xmath7 , the presence of a third field , embedding the strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations , has enormously boosted the performance of com(3p ) solution with respect to com(2p ) ones . the extremely positive comparison with the data obtained by different numerical methods for momentum - integrated quantities ( e.g. local properties ) as functions of all model parameters ( filling , on - site coulomb repulsion and temperature ) as well as for the energy bands of the system @xcite makes this solution extremely interesting to be analyzed further . here",
    ", we have reported a summary of the behavior of the basic local quantities - the double occupancy and the chemical potential - , together with the quasi - particle energy dispersions definitely necessary to guide the subsequent analysis , which is the main focus of the present manuscript : the study of the momentum - resolved components of filling ( i.e. the momentum distribution function ) , double occupancy and nearest - neighbor spin correlation function .",
    "the analysis has been extended to com(2p ) solutions that have been used as primary reference as in the main paper @xcite . analyzing the momentum - resolved quantities",
    ", it emerges very clearly the role played by the third field with respect to the two hubbard ones in determining the behavior of many relevant quantities and allowing to get the extremely good comparison with numerical results .",
    "in particular , the proximity between com(3p ) and com(2p,@xmath117 ) solutions is further reinforced and better understood giving a guideline to further improve and , possibly , optimize the application of the com to the hubbard model with the choice of a fourth field solving the few remaining issues with com(3p)@xcite ."
