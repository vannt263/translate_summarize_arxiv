    "in the past decades , increasing attention has been paid to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of the efficient energy transfer in light harvesting complexes . in the previous investigations ,",
    "the energy transfer was often described by a semiclassical model that invokes ` hopping ' excited - state populations along discrete energy levels .",
    "explicitly , the electrons in pigment molecules , chromophores , are excited by the incident light . then the electronic excitation moves downhill from energy level to energy level through the chromophores before being trapped in the reaction center .",
    "however , it has not been conceived that the high efficient energy transfers between chromophores is realized through the electronic excited state hopping .    to understand the energy transfer among excited states of each chromophore in the rhodobacter ( rb . )",
    "sphaeroides reaction centers , fleming s group proposed recently that the plants and the photosynthetic bacteria may utilize a ` clever ' quantum algorithm for the energy transfer @xcite . unlike the semiclassical model , fleming and co - workers suggested that a successive excitations make a coherence superposition between electronic excited states of the chromophores .",
    "the energy transfer is considered to be carried by the coherence of the superposition state through an easiest route analogous to grover s algorithm for the fastest possible search of an unsorted information database @xcite .",
    "however , mohsehi _",
    "et al_. @xcite argued that the standard grover s algorithm may not be applicable to the energy transfer mechanism in photosynthesis .",
    "nevertheless , even if the plants and bacteria work unlike the grover s algorithm , the coherent dynamics evolution of the electronic excited states in chromophores could still play an important role in the chromophoric energy transfer @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall derive a dynamical spin - boson model to describe how long the coherent superposition state can be persisted in the photosynthetic purple bacterium rb .",
    "recent experiments by fleming group showed that the electronic coherence between two excited states may last for @xmath0 fs or longer @xcite . instead of investigating the coherence among all excited states of each chromophores in the rb .",
    "sphaeroides reaction centers @xcite , they investigated the coherent superposition state of two electronic excited states @xmath1 and @xmath2 in chromophores created experimentally from two successive laser pulses . the laser pulses",
    "( with wavelength @xmath3 nm and @xmath4 nm ) derives the system which is initially in the ground state @xmath5 into a coherent superposition state @xmath6 however , the system of the two excited states inevitably interacts with its environment , which results in the decoherence of the coherent superposition state @xmath7 . to obtain the persistent time of coherence , i.e. , the decoherence time of @xmath7 , fleming et al .",
    "use the third incident pulse ( with wavelength @xmath3 nm ) to produce a photon echo . from the echo signals they extract the decoherence time of the coherent state @xmath7 @xcite .    to be specific , in the two - color photon echo experiment on bacterial reaction centers ( rc ) @xcite , the rc from the photosynthetic purple bacterium rb .",
    "sphaeroides includes a bacteriochlorophyll dimer , called the special pair ( p ) , in the center , an accessory bacteriochlorophyll flanking p on each side ( bchl ) , and a bacteriopheophytin ( bphy ) next to each bchl .",
    "the rc of rb .",
    "sphaeroides has several absorption peaks which are made by the chromophores . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the absorption spectrum of the p - oxidized rc at @xmath8 k shows the h band at @xmath3 nm and the b band at @xmath4 nm ( where h and b are used to denote excitonic states which are dominatingly produced from monomeric bphy and accessory bchl in the rc , respectively ) . at the first step ,",
    "they used a successive two laser pulses with different colors and tuned for resonant excitation of h transition at @xmath3 nm ( at time @xmath9 and the b transition at @xmath4 nm ( at time @xmath10 cast on the sample .",
    "the two pulses produce a coherent superposition state @xmath11 between the electronic excited states @xmath1 and @xmath12 .",
    "then , in order to measure the decoherence time of the coherent superposition of these two excited states , the third laser pulse is cast on the sample after a time @xmath13 from the second pulse , which generates a photon echo . when the times @xmath14 and @xmath15 are different one can detect the different integrated intensity of the echo signals in the phase matched direction . if the time @xmath16 is fixed ( the fixed time @xmath17 fs in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the integrated echo signals as a function of @xmath13 represents the decoherence of the coherent superposition between @xmath1 and @xmath18 .",
    "the evolutions of the integrated echo signals are plotted in the fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite . from the experimental data",
    "one can see that : ( 1 ) the coherence is resonant with different frequencies in the first @xmath0 fs .",
    "the first , the second and the third periods are about @xmath19 fs , @xmath20 fs , and @xmath21 fs respectively ; ( 2 ) the coherence between the excited states @xmath1 and @xmath18 persists for more than @xmath0 fs ; ( 3 ) the third peak in the evolution of the coherence decay more fast than the first and second peaks . in the following , we shall attempt to understand theoretically the dynamical process of excited electron states in chromophores and to explain the above experimental result . it is interesting to see , as we shall show later , that the problem can be described by a dynamical spin - boson model where the two excited states are time - dependently coupled one another through the laser pulses , as an effect of the photon - induced dynamics . to be explicit , we model the bchl and bphy molecules by the hamiltonian in the condon approximation as @xcite @xmath22 here , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the energies of the ground state @xmath5 , the two excited states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the doubly excited state @xmath27 .",

    "as one can see , the ground state @xmath49 and the doubly excited state @xmath50 are now decoupled from the single excited states @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "it shows that the energy splitting of the two excited states and the coupling between them are shifted by the pulse - induced time - dependent dipole - dipole interaction [ @xmath57 , as an effect of photon - induced dynamics .",
    "furthermore , this two - level system , as a part of chromophores , is inevitable to interact with its protein environment through the thermal vibrations .",
    "this thermal reservoir can always be modeled with a set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "then the total system of the two - level system coupled to its environment can be written as a dynamical spin - boson model , @xmath58 in which the last two terms are the interaction between the two - level system and the bath and the hamiltonian of the thermal bath itself , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is the coupling of the system to the bath and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of the @xmath62-th thermal mode .",
    "the decoherence dynamics of the above two - level system are mainly induced by the back - actions of the thermal bath as well as the decay of the time - dependent coupling induced by laser pulses .",
    "the solution of the problem is now completely determined by the parameters @xmath63 and the spectral density of the thermal bath@xcite @xmath64here @xmath65 is the high - frequency cut - off of the bath modes .",
    "different @xmath66 correspond to the super - ohmic @xmath67 , the ohmic @xmath68 , and the sub - ohmic @xmath69 baths , and @xmath70 is a dimensionless dissipative parameter describing the coupling between the two - level system and the bath .",
    "the spin - boson model has been investigated by many methods though it has not be exactly solved and some approximation , such as the markov approximation , must be used @xcite . here",
    ", we shall apply the quasiadiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) technique @xcite to explore the decoherence dynamics of this system , where non - markovian processes are involved . indeed , as it has been pointed out @xcite the evolution of this time - dependent system should be highly non - markovian . to see how the non - markovian dynamics may play an important role ,",
    "it is useful to estimate the correlation time of the thermal bath , which can be obtained from the bath response function @xmath71 ,   \\label{eq6}\\]]where @xmath72 with boltzmann s constant @xmath73 and the temperature @xmath74 .",
    "when the real and imaginary parts of @xmath75 behave as a delta function @xmath76 and its derivative @xmath77 , respectively , the dynamics of the reduced density matrix is markovian .",
    "otherwise , non - markovian dynamics occurs .",
    "the broader the re@xmath78 $ ] and im@xmath78 $ ] are , the longer the correlation time will be , and the more serious the practical dynamics is distorted by the markov approximation .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the correlation times of the bath .",
    "the result is shown in fig .  1 . as we can see the correlation time of the bath is about @xmath79 fs which actually depends on the frequency cutoff @xmath65 in the bath .",
    "the decoherence dynamics of the coherent superposition states @xmath7 is characterized by the time evolution of the reduced density matrix obtained after tracing out the bath degrees of freedom , i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "\\label{eq9}\\ ] ] following the experiment , the interaction between system and bath is turned on at @xmath81 when the second laser pulse is applied .",
    "thus , the density matrix of the total system before the time @xmath81 is a direct product of the system and bath components , namely , @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the `` initial '' states of the system and the bath at @xmath81 .",
    "if we set @xmath85 , the initial resonant two excited state can be written as @xmath86 .",
    "after the canonical transformation , the initial state remains almost the same : @xmath87 under the condition @xmath88 which is satisfied for the parameters we taken in the following numerical calculations .",
    "we also set the bath initially at the thermal equilibrium , namely , @xmath89tr@xmath90 .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath91 can be evaluated by using the well established iterative tensor multiplication ( itm ) algorithm derived from the quapi .",
    "this algorithm is numerically exact and successfully tested and adopted in various problems of open quantum systems @xcite . for details of the scheme , we refer to previous works @xcite .",
    "the quapi asks for the system hamiltonian splitting into two parts @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 . in order to make the calculations converge we use the time step @xmath95 fs which is shorter than the correlation time of the bath and the characteristic time of the two - level subsystem . in order to include all non - markovian effect of the bath in the itm scheme",
    ", one should choose @xmath96 so that @xmath97 is not much shorter than the correlation time @xmath98 of the bath .",
    "here , @xmath96 is roughly equal to the number of time steps needed to span the half - width of the response function @xmath99 @xcite",
    ". then taking @xmath100 should be large enough in our calculations .",
    "the decoherence of the two exciton states is reflected through the decays of the off - diagonal reduced density matrix element . in fig .",
    "2a and b we plot the evolution of the off - diagonal reduced density matrix element at temperature @xmath101 k and @xmath102 k , respectively , where the environment is assumed as an ohmic bath ( @xmath103 ) , and the parameters @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath105 @xmath107 @xmath105 @xmath108 @xmath109 , @xmath110 @xmath109 and @xmath111 s@xmath112 .",
    "we take the kondo parameter @xmath113 and the frequency cutoff @xmath114 @xmath109 @xcite for the thermal bath . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , we take @xmath17 fs , and @xmath115 fs .    the black square boxes in fig .  2 are the experimental data from @xcite , the linked blue and red dots are our numerical results .",
    "the plots show that our theoretical description is in good agreement with the experimental results . as we see",
    "the coherence decay is much faster after the second peak and the oscillation periods of the evolutions increase with the time .",
    "the oscillation dephasing behaviors indeed come from the time - dependent level splitting @xmath116 and coupling @xmath117 induced by laser pulses as well as the non - markovian processes due to the interaction between the two - level system and the thermal bath .",
    "further calculations show that using the sub - ohmic bath with @xmath118 and super - ohmic bath with @xmath119 , we can obtain the similar results , as show in fig .",
    "however , if we use the same value of the dimensionless dissipative parameter @xmath70 for the ohmic , sub - ohmic and super - ohmic spectral densities , the corresponding decoherence behaviors are completely different .",
    "this indicates that the decoherence dynamics is non - markovian . to show the non - markovian effect",
    ", we also calculate the markov approximation with the same parameters in the ohmic case .",
    "the detailed numerical results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , where the difference between the non - markovian dynamics and the corresponding markov approximation is obvious .",
    "we should also point out that the bare level splitting @xmath120 is not the experimentally observed values .",
    "the experimental values ( @xmath121 @xmath109 ) of the level splitting contains the pulse - induced time - dependent effects plus the back - action effect from the environment in the non - markovian regime so that the input value of @xmath122 is different from the splitting of experimental linear absorbance peaks . a practical calculation of the true site energy difference that contains all the the pulse - induced time - dependent effects plus the back - action effect from the environment may be possible @xcite but it is beyond the scope of the present investigation . here",
    "the input value of the bare level splitting is based on how better to fit the experimental data .",
    "our numerical calculations show that the profiles of the evolution curves for the off - diagonal reduced density matrix elements are sensitive to the changes of the bare level splitting @xmath122 , the bare coupling @xmath123 and the parameter @xmath124 but insensitive to the changes of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath125 @xmath109 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we plot the time evolution of off - diagonal reduced density matrix element with different @xmath122 . as we can see , the change of the bare level splitting @xmath126 produces a quite different pattern of the decoherence dynamics",
    ". a smaller value of @xmath127 will result in a shorter oscillation period of the evolution in time .    also , the bare electronic coupling @xmath123 between the exciton states @xmath52 and @xmath51 is not the electronic coupling @xmath128 between the bchl and bphy molecules that used in @xcite .",
    "our numerical results suggest that @xmath123 is much smaller ( @xmath129 @xmath109 ) than the pulse - induced dipole - dipole interaction but is not negligible .",
    "change of @xmath123 leads to very different decoherence behavior as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which is actually also convinced in the supplemental material of @xcite .",
    "the resulting effective electronic coupling @xmath130 oscillates in time with the maximum amplitude being less than @xmath0 @xmath131    as one can see , our numerical result shows that the oscillation of the off - diagonal reduced density matrix element is due to the effective time - dependence of the level splitting and flip coupling between the two excitonic states induced by the laser pulses .",
    "this differs from the interpretation given in @xcite where it has been pointed out that reproducing the long dephasing time observed would require a value of @xmath132 @xmath109 , but a large @xmath128 implies that the bchl and bphy excitations are almost degenerate , which may not be consistent with the observed spectra .",
    "therefore they argued that the vibrational modes begin to contribute in the energy transfer .",
    "their simulation shows that a vibrational mode ( with a frequency @xmath133 @xmath109 ) coupling to the excitonic states can fit the long dephasing time very well .",
    "here we show that the large effective coupling between the two excited states induced by the laser pulses combining with a very smaller but not negligible bare coupling @xmath123 can reproduce the long dephasing time observed , without including the contribution arisen from the vibrational mode .",
    "on the other hand , the level splitting and flip coupling we derived explicitly depend on the parameter @xmath134 .",
    "the dipole moment @xmath135 ( debye ) where the dipole strength @xmath136 can be estimated by : @xmath137 @xcite . here",

    "therefore the pulse intensity is @xmath154 w / cm@xmath145 which corresponds to a pulse field amplitude @xmath155 v / cm .",
    "thus , the realistic dipole - field coupling strength @xmath156 @xmath109 .",
    "this is very close to the value of our theoretical best fitting @xmath157 @xmath109 in the numerical calculation .",

    "it shows that increasing @xmath158 will decrease the oscillation periods of the evolution in time , and vice versa .",
    "this property may be used for further experimental test of whether the pulse - induced time - dependent dipole - dipole interaction or the additional vibrational mode gives rise to the oscillation decay of the coherent excitonic states .    in conclusion , we present in this paper a dynamical spin - boson model with the effective time - dependence of the level splitting and flip coupling between the two excited states , induced by laser pulses , to describe the long dephasing time observed recently in a photosynthesis experiment @xcite .",
