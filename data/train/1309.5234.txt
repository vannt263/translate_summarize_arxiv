    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) are dynamically active stellar systems where interactions and collisions , especially involving binaries , are quite frequent @xcite . these interactions",

    "bsss are the most abundant products of this activity .",
    "they are brighter and bluer than the main sequence ( ms ) turnoff ( to ) .",
    "they lie along an extension of the ms and they are known to be more massive than normal to stars @xcite . because of their mass , bsss are invaluable probes of gc internal dynamics . in particular , it has recently shown that their radial distribution is a powerful tool to measure the cluster dynamical age @xcite . nevertheless , many basic questions about the formation mechanisms and the physical properties of these puzzling objects remain open .",
    "two main scenarios have been proposed for their formation : they could form through mass transfer in a binary system that could lead to the complete coalescence of the two companions ( mt - bsss ; @xcite ) or through stellar collisions ( col - bsss ; @xcite ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations suggest different chemical patterns for bsss formed through the two different mechanisms .",
    "in particular , mt - bsss are expected to show c and o depletion @xcite whereas no chemical anomalies are predicted for col - bsss @xcite . on the contrary , predictions about the bss rotational velocity v@xmath2 @xmath3 are quite controversial .",
    "in fact , both mt- and col - bsss are expected to rotate fast @xcite , but accurate simulations are lacking for mt - bsss and braking mechanisms may intervene both for mt- and col - bsss slowing down the initial bss rotation , with timescales and efficiencies still unknown @xcite .",
    "in addition to gcs , bsss have been detected in a variety of low - density environments such as galactic open clusters @xcite , dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group @xcite , the milky way s bulge @xcite and halo @xcite and , recently , also ultra - faint galaxies @xcite . despite less populous than gcs",
    ", these low - density systems contain a high percentage of bsss .",
    "however , the low collisional rate in low - density environments implies a different origin for the bsss in gcs and loose systems , where bsss likely formed exclusively by mt .    in this framework , we started an observational campaign aimed at performing the first systematic study of the chemical and kinematical properties of bsss in gcs and at studying their possible differences in mt- and col - bsss .",
    "spectroscopic results by @xcite have observationally revealed the presence of a subpopulation of co - depleted bsss in 47 tucanae and similarly @xcite identified 4 bsss with o upper limits incompatible with the cluster o abundance in m30 . in both cases ,",
    "the amount of the observed c and o depletion is incompatible with that expected for second generation stars ( predicted to be c and o poor ) and can not be interpreted in terms of self - enrichment processes . on the contrary",
    ", @xcite found no evidence of co - depleted bsss in m4 , whereas no interpretation in terms of formation mechanism was possible for the bsss studied by @xcite in ngc 6397 , due to the occurrence of a diffusion process , called radiative levitation , that alters chemical abundances on the surfaces of stars with shallow or no - convective envelopes .",
    "@xcite identified only one fast rotating ( v@xmath2 @xmath450 @xmath0 ) bss in 47 tucanae , corresponding to @xmath52% of the studied population .",

    "observations were performed during two different runs ( 081.d-0356 and 089.d-0298 , hereafter p81 and p89 , respectively ) with the uves+giraffe combined mode , during the nights 2008 august 13 - 16 and 2012 july 4 .",
    "spectra have been acquired for 22 bsss and 26 red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , most of them being observed in both p81 and p89 .",
    "four different setups have been used for the spectroscopic observations : hr5a ( with spectral coverage 4340 - 4587   and spectral resolution r=18470 ) , hr15n ( 6470 - 6790  , r=17000 ) , hr18 ( 7468 - 7889  , r=18400 ) and hr22a ( 8816 - 9565  , r=11642 ) , suitable to sample some metallic lines , the h@xmath6 line , the o  i triplet at @xmath7   and two c  i lines at 9078.3 and 9111.8  , respectively .",
    "multiple exposures for each target have been secured according to the efficiency of the different setups , in particular 5 exposures with hr5a , 2 with hr15n and 4 with hr18 and hr22a have been obtained . the total exposure times amount to 3.75 hours for the hr5a , 1.5 hours for the hr15n and 3 hours for the hr18 and hr22a .",

    "[ cmd ] shows the cmds for the acs and wfi datasets , with the position of all the analyzed targets .",
    "the spectra pre - reduction has been performed by using the latest version of the giraffe eso pipeline ( _ gasgano _ version 2.4.3 ) , that includes bias subtraction , flat - field correction , wavelength calibration and one - dimensional spectra extraction . for each exposure we subtracted the corresponding master sky spectrum , obtained by averaging several spectra of sky regions . by combining the sky - subtracted exposures",
    ", we obtained median spectra with signal - to - noise ratios s / n@xmath8 for the selected bsss , and s / n@xmath9 for the rgb stars .",
    "in order to assess cluster membership for each target , radial velocities ( rvs ) have been measured with the iraf task _ fxcor _ following the technique described by @xcite .",

    "however , particular discussion deserves bss13 .",
    "this star has rv=@xmath1314.1@xmath0 so that it is within 3.5@xmath11 from the mean rv and it is located very close ( 23.8 ) to the cluster centre .",
    "moreover , its iron content is fully in agreement with the mean cluster metallicity ( see sect .",
    "[ chem ] ) . by using besanon galactic model by @xcite",
    ", we derived the metallicity distribution of field stars in the direction of ngc 6752 , within the same magnitude and colour intervals shared by our bss sample .",
    "we computed that the probability to observe a field star with an iron content similar to that of bss13 ( [ fe / h]@xmath141.43 ) is 1.4% .",

    "[ vrad ] the systemic velocity of ngc 6752 is very similar to the peak of the rv distribution of field stars in the direction of the cluster @xcite , so that the probability of field contamination among the bsss is very high and the measure of radial velocities can not totally guarantee the cluster membership .",
    "therefore , in order to further constrain the membership of bsss in our sample , we used proper motions : we performed a cross - correlation between our bss sample and the catalog of @xcite by using the software cataxcorr ( p.montegriffo , private communication ) .",
    "we found 9 bsss in common . according to their proper motions ,",
    "one bss in our sample ( with rv=@xmath1322.7 @xmath0 , totally in agreement with the systemic velocity ) certainly belongs to the field , one ( namely bss5 ) is a possible cluster member , whereas the remaining 7 stars ( namely bss1 , bss10 , bss11 , bss14 , bss15 , bss16 and bss17 ) are likely members . after removing non - member bsss ( large black dots in fig .",

    "in particular , bss11 and bss17 are classified as sx - phoenicis whereas bss6 is likely a @xmath16 dor type pulsator and bss10 has been classified as a possible binary composed of a hot extreme - horizontal branch star ( ehb ) and a red companion on the basis of its location in the cmd .",
    "+ we have measured rv variation of @xmath5 13 @xmath0 and @xmath5 5 @xmath0 between p81 and p89 for bss11 and bss17 , both classified as sx - phoenicis . moreover , for bss11 we observe differences in the rv also between individual hr5a exposures ( up to @xmath17 ) . given the duration of our exposures ( 45 minutes each ) ,",
    "the variation of rv is in agreement with the period found by @xcite for those sx - phoenicis ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 minutes ) .",
    "however , we stress that the time sampling of our data set is not suitable to perform an accurate investigation of the radial velocity variability that can reveal possible binary stars .",
    "this does not rule out the possibility that some of the bsss in our sample belong to binary systems .",
    "a further clarification should be done also for bss10 .",
    "based on its position in the cmd , @xcite suggested that this star could be an unresolved binary system formed by an ehb star and a red companion .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , the optimal way to observe hot stars like bsss and horizontal branch stars is at ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths .",
    "in fact , in this plane rgb stars ( the brightest objects in the optical cmd ) are faint and the identification of hot stars is very easy .",
    "therefore , in order to investigate the possibility that bss10 could be an unresolved binary system , we identified it in the uv wfpc2 catalog used by @xcite . according to its position in the uv plane ( see fig .",
    "[ wfpc2 ] ) we can conclude that bss10 is too faint to be an ehb , but it is instead one of the brightest bsss in ngc 6752 .",
    "we suggest that the variability observed in the light curve by @xcite might be due to a bss in a binary system with a low - mass ms companion .",
    "effective temperature ( t@xmath20 ) and surface gravity ( log g ) for all the observed targets have been derived comparing their position in the cmd with theoretical isochrones ( with different ages ) from the padova database @xcite .",

    "conservative errors in temperatures and gravities have been considered : 100 k and 0.2 dex both for bsss and rgb stars .",
    "concerning microturbulent velocity , the small number of metallic lines prevents us to derive spectroscopically this parameter . for this reason",
    ", we assumed 2.0@xmath0 and 1.5@xmath0 for bss and rgb stars , respectively .",
    "we finally adopted a conservative error of 0.5 @xmath0 for all the targets .",
    "rotational velocities have been derived for all the targets through a @xmath22 minimization between the observed spectrum and a grid of synthetic spectra , computed for all stars by adopting the estimated atmospheric parameters and different rotational values .",

    "model atmospheres for the synthetic spectra have been calculated with atlas9 code @xcite under the assumptions of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and plane - parallel geometry and adopting the new opacity distribution functions by @xcite , without the inclusion of the approximate overshooting @xcite .",
    "the most prominent features in the stellar spectra have been used to infer stellar rotations . in particular , for the rgb stars v@xmath2 @xmath3 values have been inferred from the ba  ii at 4554.03   whereas for bsss from the mg  ii line at 4481   and the o  i line at 7771.95  .",

    "<S> we used high - resolution spectra acquired with the multifiber facility flames at the very large telescope of the european southern observatory to investigate the chemical and kinematical properties of a sample of 22 blue straggler stars ( bsss ) and 26 red giant branch stars in the nearby globular cluster ngc 6752 . </S>",
    "<S> we measured radial and rotational velocities and fe , o and c abundances . according to radial velocities , metallicity and proper motions we identified 18 bsss as likely cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> we found that all the bsss rotate slowly ( less than 40@xmath0 ) , similar to the findings in 47 tucanae , ngc 6397 and m30 . </S>",
    "<S> the fe abundance analysis reveals the presence of 3 bsss affected by radiative levitation ( showing [ fe / h ] significantly higher than that measured in  </S>",
    "<S> normal  </S>",
    "<S> cluster stars ) , confirming that element transport mechanisms occur in the photosphere of bsss hotter than @xmath18000 k. finally , bss c and o abundances are consistent with those measured in dwarf stars . no c and o depletion ascribable to mass transfer processes has been found on the atmospheres of the studied bsss ( at odds with previous results for 47 tucanae and m30 ) , suggesting the collisional origin for bsss in ngc 6752 or that the co - depletion is a transient phenomenon . </S>"
