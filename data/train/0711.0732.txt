    "due to geometrical frustration , transition metal spinel oxides with a general formula @xmath3o@xmath1 display a variety of unusual low - temperature properties .",
    "the spin dynamics of these systems is usually described by a heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "this model is rather peculiar and its classical ground state is highly degenerate .",
    "exact degeneracy can be lifted by various mechanisms , but the system still possesses many competing spin configurations with almost equal energies . as a result ,",
    "when the temperature goes down , the system can evolve in a variety of ways : it can remain spin liquid down to the lowest temperatures due to quantum fluctuations , or choose a particular configuration either via the strongest order from disorder mechanism or through a structural phase transition which lowers the local symmetry of the lattice .",
    "a peculiarity of transition metal spinels is that their magnetic ions often possess also an orbital degree of freedom .",
    "this extra degree of freedom modulates the spin exchange and can at least partially lift the geometrical degeneracy of the underlying lattice .",
    "however , the orbital degrees of freedom in geometrically frustrated lattices are by themselves frustrated , i.e. , many different orbital configurations have the same energy .",
    "in this situation , the ordering in the orbital sector is coupled to the ordering in the spin sector , and the selection of a true ground state configuration becomes a non - trivial phenomena .    of particular interest",
    "is the orbital ordering in the @xmath4 systems on the pyrochlore lattice . in this work we study vanadium spinels of the type @xmath5v@xmath0o@xmath1 , where @xmath5 is a divalent ion like cd@xmath6 , zn@xmath6 , or mg@xmath6 . in these compounds ,",
    "magnetically active v@xmath7 ions form a pyrochlore lattice and have two @xmath8 electrons in @xmath4-orbitals . due to strong hund s interaction ,",
    "these two electrons form a state with @xmath2 .",
    "all @xmath5v@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds show qualitatively similar structural and magnetic behavior , independently of what the divalent a ion is , and undergo two phase transitions  a structural one and an antiferromagnetic one . we will be mainly discussing the physics of znv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the structural transition occurs at a temperature @xmath9  50  k.  @xcite below @xmath10 , the lattice shows a tetragonal distortion ",
    "the vanadium octahedra vo@xmath11 are uniformly flattened along the @xmath12 axis , and the symmetry is lowered from the cubic one to @xmath13 , which is the highest - symmetry tetragonal space group for the spinel structure .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition occurs at a slightly lower temperature @xmath14 of about 40  k.  @xcite this temperature is significantly lower than the curie - weiss temperature @xmath15 , extracted from high temperature susceptibility ,  @xcite which underlines the importance of geometrical frustration .",
    "the magnetic structure of av@xmath0o@xmath1 spinels at @xmath16 was first proposed by nizio  @xcite and recently confirmed by reehius _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "along the diagonal @xmath17/[{\\bar 1}10]$ ] direction in the @xmath18-plane , the ordering is antiferromagnetic + - + - ... , while along the two other diagonal directions @xmath19/[0{\\bar 1}1]$ ] in the @xmath20-plane and @xmath21/[{\\bar 1}01]$ ] in the @xmath22-plane , the spin ordering is in the form + + - - + + - - ...

    "@xcite on the powder sample of znv@xmath0o@xmath1 still show strong low energy magnetic excitations which form a broad peak centered at @xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "this broad peak is present also at @xmath26 , however it becomes asymmetric and shifts towards a smaller value of @xmath27 .",
    "the asymmetry of the peak further increases in the magnetically ordered phase ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "@xcite the value of @xmath27 and its temperature evolution can not be explained within a purely spin model , whose fundamental degrees of freedom are antiferromagnetic hexagonal spin loops with @xmath29@xmath25 , which is larger than the experimental @xmath27 .",
    "the spin dynamics , however , can be understood if one assumes that spin degrees of freedom are affected by the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , the spatial asymmetry of the peak in the intermediate phase can be understood as the consequence of the fact that at @xmath30 , vanadium octahedra are flattened and @xmath18-orbital at each site is occupied .",
    "this leads to a strong antiferromagnetic exchange between vanadium spins along @xmath18 direction , and , as a result , spin interactions become effectively one - dimensional .",
    "strong one - dimensional spin fluctuations give rise , via spin - orbit coupling , to fluctuations of the occupations of @xmath22 or @xmath20 orbitals , causing the anisotropy of the neutron peak .",
    "there were several theoretical attempts to understand the nature of the ground state of znv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "however , although it is widely accepted that orbital degrees of freedom play an important role , no consensus is reached yet about the type of the orbital ordering ( oo ) in the ground state . the first attempt to explain the physics of znv@xmath0o@xmath1 focused on the spin - lattice coupling mechanism ,  @xcite however it did nt explain why the structural and spin order occur at different temperatures .",
    "tsunetsugu and motome  @xcite later addressed this issue and related the presence of two separate phase transitions at @xmath14 and @xmath10 to the interplay between geometrical frustration and @xmath31 superexchange ( se ) interaction between v - ions .",
    "the ground state orbital ordering suggested in ref .",
    "consists of stacked @xmath32 planes with alternating orbital occupations @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "hereafter we label this orbital patterns as roo .",
    "they also showed that this ordering of orbitals can partially remove magnetic frustration and explain experimentally observed ordered magnetic structure .    on the other hand ,",
    "tchernyshyov  @xcite pointed out that the ground state obtained in ref .",
    "is at odds with x - ray and neutron diffraction data , because it does not possess the required @xmath13 space symmetry .",
    "he argued that the spin - orbit coupling should be included into consideration .",
    "he considered a purely ionic model in which spin - orbit ( so ) coupling plays the major role and determines the orbital order in the tetragonal phase .",
    "he suggested the following oo : one electron on each site occupies @xmath18 orbital , while the second electron is spreaded between @xmath22 and @xmath20 orbitals in such a way as to minimize the spin - orbit energy at each site .",
    "hereafter we label this orbital pattern as coo .",
    "recently r. valenti _",
    "et al._@xcite found in the ab - initio dft calculations that a correct space symmetry can be actually obtained within the reasoning of ref .  , if one includes into consideration an additional trigonal distortion .",
    "still , the true ground state turns out to be the same as in ref .  .",
    "the ideas of refs .   and were combined in the unique framework by s. di matteo _ et al . _ in ref .  .",
    "they proposed to construct a classical ground state phase diagram by considering se interaction and so coupling on equal footing .",
    "they demonstrated that the so coupling is a relevant perturbation and favors the states with unquenched orbital momentum for any value of the coupling strength . they obtained a variety of phases and found that for reasonable values of se and so couplings , the ground state agrees with the experimentally observed one .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .   and study the low energy excitations in vanadium spinels .",
    "we find that the magnetic excitation spectrum strongly depends on the type of the oo , and that it is qualitatively different for the ground states with patterns that consist of real orbitals and those with the complex linear combination of orbitals , i.e. complex orbitals .",
    "the former ground state is characterized by a quenched orbital angular momentum ( @xmath35 ) , while the later by a unquenched ( @xmath36 ) orbital angular momentum .",
    "@xcite the difference in the magnetic excitation spectrum arises due to the fact that the magnetic moment of the vanadium ion is formed by both spin and orbital momentum , and fluctuations of @xmath37 contribute to the spectrum of magnetic excitations .",
    "we argue that the measurement of magnetic excitations in neutron scattering experiments can shed light on the nature of the oo in the ground state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the model appropriate for the description of the physical properties of znv@xmath0o@xmath1 . in section iii",
    "we discuss the ground state and the magnetic excitations of the system when the orbital angular momentum is quenched .",
    "we derive linear spin - wave theory of @xmath2 moments interacting on the @xmath38 pyrochlore lattice . in section",
    "iv we discuss ground state and magnetic excitations of the system when the orbital angular momentum is unquenched .",
    "we show that magnetic excitations for unquenched orbital angular momentum can be described in the framework of the magnetic excitonic model .",
    "section v presents the conclusions .",
    "some mathematical details are given in the appendices a and b.",
    "the minimal model describing the low energy physics of vanadium spinel is given by @xmath39 the first term describes nearest neighbors ( @xmath40 ) super - exchange interactions between vanadium @xmath2 spins , arising from the virtual excitations @xmath41 .",
    "these interactions can be written as : @xmath42 } o_{ij } \\\\   & -\\sum_{<ij>}j_2{\\big [ } 1-{\\bf s}_i\\cdot { \\bf s}_{j}{\\big ] } { \\bar o}_{ij}~ , \\end{array } \\label{spinorb2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are nearest neighbors , @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath46/[1 - 3\\eta]$ ] , @xmath47/[1 + 2\\eta]$ ] are coupling constants , @xmath48 is the overall energy scale ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the intra - orbital coulomb repulsion ) , @xmath51 is the normalized hund s exchange .",
    "we consider only the largest the hopping term , associated with @xmath52-bonding  @xcite .",
    "such hopping is diagonal and non - zero only if the orbitals and the plane in which hopping occurs are of the same @xmath53 type ( @xmath54 , @xmath20 , @xmath18 ) . in this case",
    "orbital contributions @xmath55 and @xmath56 are expressed in terms of projectors @xmath57 onto the occupied orbital state @xmath53 at site @xmath43 and @xmath44 : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    to describe the anisotropy and spin - orbit coupling term , we use the fact that , when the crystal field splitting between @xmath4 and @xmath60 orbitals is large , the @xmath4-electrons can be represented by an effective orbital angular momentum @xmath61  @xcite the anisotropy term ( the second term of the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) ) ,",
    "is then given by @xmath62 where @xmath12 is a constant .",
    "this term describes the tetragonal distortion in the @xmath4 manifold .",
    "we notice , that here for simplicity we neglect the trigonal distortion , which is small compared to the tetragonal one .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling term ( the third term in ( [ hamil ] ) ) is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is so coupling constant .",
    "note that the true angular momentum @xmath65 is related to an effective one as @xmath66 .",
    "the parameters of the model can be estimated from the experiments .",
    "the spectroscopy data  @xcite yield the hund s exchange , @xmath67 ev and coulomb intra - orbital repulsion @xmath68  ev . the estimate of hopping matrix element from x - ray photoemission spectroscopy is @xmath69  ev.@xcite , so the energy scale is @xmath70  mev . since the so coupling constant is @xmath71  mev ( ref .  ) , we can see that the super - exchange and the spin - orbit couplings are comparable and , therefore should be treated on equal footing .",
    "first we discuss the ground state of the super - exchange hamiltonian alone ( eq . [ spinorb2 ] ) . without the anisotropy and spin - orbit terms the ground state orbital patterns",
    "consist of only real orbitals : at each site two out of three @xmath4 orbitals @xmath72 , are occupied .",
    "this type of orbital patterns is called real orbital order , as opposed to complex orbital order , when the orbital state is formed by a complex superposition of @xmath4 orbitals in such a way , that the gain of spin orbit interaction energy is maximized .    depending on which orbitals are occupied , one obtains two types of interacting bonds and also non - interacting bonds .",
    "consider for example a bond in the @xmath53-plane . if there is an electron occupying @xmath53 orbital only on one site of such bond ,",
    "then the bond , which we label as @xmath73 , is weakly ferromagnetic ( fm ) , and is described by @xmath74 .",
    "if both @xmath43 and @xmath44 sites of @xmath75 bond are occupied by @xmath53 electrons , then the bond , which we label as @xmath76 , is strongly antiferromagnetic ( afm ) .",
    "the exchange coupling is then given by @xmath77 .",
    "when neither @xmath43 nor @xmath44 site have @xmath53-orbital occupied , the bond is non - interacting .",
    "one can easily demonstrate  @xcite that for positive @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the lowest energy configuration corresponds to the state with four ferromagnetic @xmath73 bonds per tetrahedron .",
    "there still exist two topologically different tetrahedral configurations with four @xmath80 bonds , characterized by different oo patterns .",
    "one of them , the roo state with oo patterns proposed by tsunetsugu  @xcite , is compatible with experimentally observed magnetic structure  it yields afm chains running in [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath810 ] directions ( see , fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the classical energy per site in the roo state is @xmath82 .",
    "however , this state is actually not the true ground state of the super - exchange hamiltonian ( [ spinorb2 ] ) . the other state with 4  @xmath80 bonds ( the roo - i state in our notations ) , in which spins of each tetrahedron form a fully collinear up - up - up - down ( @xmath83 ) state , has the ground state energy @xmath84 , which is lower than that of the roo state .",
    "this is the lowest classical energy that one can obtain within the manifold with quenched angular momentum at each site  @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetic ordering associated with the roo - i state is incompatible with the experimentally observed one : in roo - i two neighboring spins in @xmath18-plane are ferromagnetically aligned whereas the experimentally detected coupling in @xmath18-plane is antiferromagnetic .",
    "this discrepancy between the roo - i ground state of the super - exchange hamiltonian (    [ spinorb2 ] ) and the experimental findings demonstrates the necessity of taking into account additional interactions we study the the anisotropy term and the spin - orbit coupling in the section iv . + one can also consider the model with both the super - exchange ( se ) and the jahn - teller ( jt ) couplings @xcite with a hope that the cooperative jt effect , which plays an important role in the structural transition , can also stabilize the roo type of orbital order .",
    "this model has been studied in ref .   by both the mean - field analysis and monte carlo simulations . here",
    "we assume that the roo phase can be realized and in the next subsection we derive magnetic excitations spectrum for the corresponding effective spin model .",
    "the starting point for the calculation of the magnon excitation spectrum is the classical neel ground state with antiferromagnetic spin chains in @xmath18-planes ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . this ground state has the magnetic unit cell with eight vanadium spins , which we denote as @xmath85 ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . after averaging the orbital operators we can re -",

    "+ to describe the excitation spectrum of such eight - sublattice antiferromagnet , we introduce eight boson operators : @xmath89 .",
    "we employ holstein - primakoff transformation , e.g. for up - spins @xmath90 and down - spins @xmath91 we have : @xmath92 in the linear spin wave approximation we substitute @xmath93 in the expressions above . performing fourier transformation @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the number of lattice sites belonging to one sublattice",

    "the matrices @xmath98 and @xmath99 are eight by eight matrices whose elements depend on the geometry of the lattice and the type of the magnetic ordering , tilde denotes the complex conjugation . the explicit expression for matrix elements",
    "are presented in appendix a. the quadratic form is diagonalized using the generalized bogoliubov transformation . in the diagonal form , the hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath100 where the index @xmath101 runs from 1 to 8 , @xmath102 are magnon energies and @xmath103 are linear combinations of boson operators belonging to @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we obtained the spin - wave excitation spectrum by solving eq .",
    "( [ hdiag ] ) numerically .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]    along high - symmetry directions of 3d brillouin zone .",
    "we used @xmath106 mev , and the ferromagnetic constant @xmath107 .",
    "there are 4 different branches of the spin - wave spectrum , each of them is doubly degenerate .",
    "furthermore , two of the branches have zero energy over a finite range of momenta ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( solid lines ) ) .",
    "this so called zero modes emerge because the number of ferro- and antiferro - bonds connecting two neighboring antiferromagnetic chains is the same ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and the spins forming @xmath108chains can collectively rotate with no change in energy .",
    "the existence of the zero modes is inconsistent with the observation of the magnetic ordering transition at @xmath109k .",
    "the ordering requires that the zero mode be lifted .",
    "the issue is what interactions are responsible for the lifting of spin degeneracy .",
    "a natural first step would be to consider longer range interactions  @xcite as these interactions generally remove the degeneracy ( it happens , e.g. , in a kagome antiferromagnet ) .",
    "we show below that it is indeed the case , however , the energy of the relevant degeneracy - breaking mode is very small and can not explain the magnetic ordering temperature of @xmath109k .    in fig.[fig2a ]",
    "we show the interactions which include up to third neighbors .",
    "there are 6 nearest neighbor interactions @xmath110",
    "( @xmath111 along @xmath18 chain , and @xmath112 along @xmath22 and @xmath20 bonds ) , 12 second neighbor interactions @xmath113 , and 12 third neighbor interactions @xmath114",
    ". quite often already inclusion of the second neighbor exchange lifts the degeneracy .",
    "however , here second - neighbor interactions @xmath113 are frustrated and can not remove the degeneracy , and , therefore , zero modes in the spin - wave spectrum .",
    "@xcite thus , one has to include third neighbor exchanges .",
    "there are two inequivalent sets of third neighbors , one obtained by two nearest neighbor steps @xmath114 and the other through the empty space @xmath115 ( see fig.[fig2a ] ) .",
    "when only @xmath31 hopping is considered , the exchange coupling through the empty space is zero , @xmath116 , and only @xmath114 interactions contribute .",
    "these interactions are antiferromagnetic @xmath117 , and non - zero only if they connect sites along the direction corresponding to the symmetry of the orbital occupation , ( i.e. , for orbital occupation @xmath53 , the interaction is nonzero only along @xmath118 direction ) .",
    "the third neighbor interaction is frustrated along @xmath18-chains , but it is small compared to nearest neighbor exchange along the chain , @xmath119 , and can not destroy antiferromagnetic ordering along the chain . along @xmath22 and @xmath20 directions , @xmath120 are not frustrated , and connect parallel antiferromagnetic chains located in second neighboring @xmath18 planes . the energy scale for @xmath121 is then @xmath122 .",
    "this is a very small energy , only about one percent of the frustrated ferromagnetic inter - chain coupling @xmath123 .",
    "this small interaction can not explain the magnetic ordering temperature of @xmath109  k.  @xcite here we consider this interaction only qualitatively and assume the value of coupling constant @xmath124 .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( dashed lines ) that the zero energy modes indeed become dispersive for @xmath125 .",
    "we would like to note that experimentally it has been proven that all magnetic moments are aligned along the @xmath126-direction .",
    "this experimental fact can not be explained in the framework of the se model , because it is isotropic in a spin space . in reality ,",
    "vanadium spinels likely possess a single ion spin anisotropy which aligns spin along the @xmath126-direction .",
    "the anisotropy does affect the magnetic excitation spectrum which in its presence acquires a gap . in this case , the zero mode will be lifted and the spin frustration will be removed . however , since the strength of magnetic anisotropy is not known experimentally at the moment , we can not estimate the magnitude of the anisotropy - induced gap and check whether or not this interaction alone can stabilize the ground state magnetic structure .",
    "we believe that the role of the anisotropy deserves further experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "we now consider the ground state of the system in the presence of the so coupling and the anisotropy term ( eqs .",
    "( [ anis ] ) and ( [ so ] ) ) . for any finite @xmath64",
    "the so coupling prefers the orbital state with the unquenched effective orbital angular momentum @xmath127 . in such orbital state ,",
    "one electron at each site occupies @xmath18 orbital due to the tetragonal distortion , while the second electron occupies the complex linear combination of @xmath22 and @xmath20 orbitals .",
    "the effective @xmath128 should then be parallel to the spin magnetic moment in order to minimize the spin - orbit energy , i.e. a spin - up site will have @xmath129 while a spin - down site will have @xmath130 . as we discussed earlier , this type of orbital ordering is a coo state suggested first by tchernyshyov in ref .  .",
    "its energy @xmath131-\\lambda$ ] is lower than the energy of the roo state for a wide range of parameters ( see the phase diagram in ref .  ) .",
    "the coo state is characterized by two strong afm bonds per tetrahedra , and its magnetic structure consists of afm chains in @xmath18-planes with the same interaction along the chain as in the roo state .",
    "the strengths of the inter - chain coupling @xmath132 are also practically the same for the roo and the coo states  @xcite , although @xmath133 $ ] is antiferromagnetic in the coo state , while it is ferromagnetic in the roo state . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath134 in both orbital states . in the coo state",
    "the preferred spin direction is fixed by anisotropy term ( [ anis ] ) via the so coupling to be along the @xmath126-axis , and , therefore , spins in @xmath18-chains can not rotate freely even for only nearest - neighbor exchange along the chains .",
    "the long range order + + - - ... along diagonal directions in @xmath22 and @xmath20 planes can not be determined by local interactions , but for simplicity we do not include next neighbor hopping terms in this part of our calculations .",
    "we now consider magnetic excitations in the coo state .",
    "we follow the magnetic exciton model approach of refs .  , which is the extension of the linear spin wave theory for systems with unquenched orbital angular moment .",
    "we consider states with the effective total angular momentum @xmath135 .",
    "often , energy levels with different @xmath136 are well separated in energy and both @xmath136 and its @xmath126-projection @xmath137 are good quantum numbers . however , in many transition metal oxides the strength of the spin - orbit coupling and the super - exchange interaction between localized @xmath138-electrons are comparable , and atomic energy levels with different values of @xmath136 can cross each other ; in such case only @xmath137 acts as a good quantum number .",
    "we show below that magnetic excitations in vanadium spinels av@xmath0o@xmath1 can be understood as a propagation of excitations to states with a given @xmath137 through the crystal .    to proceed , we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) as a sum of a single - ion hamiltonian @xmath139 and the term which describes the interaction between two different ions @xmath140 : @xmath141 where @xmath142 the molecular field part of the exchange interaction acting on site @xmath43 is given by @xmath143 .",

    "after diagonalization , the total hamiltonian @xmath204 can be written in the same form as eqs.([hdiag ] ) , however now the index @xmath101 runs from 1 to 16 and the modes have complex spin  orbital character .",
    "the details of calculation are given in appendix b.    the numerically calculated magnetic excitation spectrum for the coo state is presented in fig.[fig4 ] . for comparison , we also plotted there the spin - wave dispersion for the roo state .",
    "we used the following parameters : @xmath106 mev , @xmath205 , @xmath206 mev , and @xmath207 mev ( third neighbors interactions are not included here ) . as we see from fig.[fig4 ] , the excitation spectrum consists of 8 different branches , each of them is doubly degenerate . the excitations may be divided into two groups : four low lying branches with rather small gap @xmath208 mev , and four optical branches , with the gap @xmath209 mev . as @xmath210 , the lying branches are quasi - acoustic modes . as we see in fig.[fig4 ] , the lowest mode along the direction @xmath211 is the dispersionless mode .",
    "this flat mode is a lifted `` zero energy mode '' of the roo state . here",
    "the zero mode is lifted due to the combined effect of the anisotropy term and the so coupling .",
    "the tetragonal distortion favors the non - zero value of the @xmath126-component of orbital angular momentum , which in turn , selects the local spin quantization axis in such a way , that the @xmath126 component of spin is non - zero .",
    "we found that the gap , @xmath212 is mainly determined by the anisotropy term and only weakly depends on the so coupling ( see fig.[fig4a ] ) .",
    "however , we note once again , that , in principle , the lifting of zero energy mode can appear also in roo state if single ion magnetic anisotropy is taken into account .",
    "we caution that the size of these two different anisotropy gaps can be of the same order , and therefore , it will be rather difficult to distinguish between them .    as a remark",
    ", we would like to mention , that such lifted zero energy modes can be detected by an inelastic neutron scattering , and have been indeed recently observed in the frustrated kagome lattice antiferromagnet kfe@xmath213(oh)@xmath11(so@xmath1)@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "there is another significant difference between the magnetic excitation spectrum for coo and roo states : as one can see from fig.[fig4 ] , the bandwidth of quasi - acoustic modes in the coo state is strongly reduced compared to the bandwidth of pure spin waves in the roo state .",
    "this reduction is the effect of the mixing between orbital and pure spin excitations in the spectra of the coo state .",
    "pure orbital excitations are non - dispersive , because they come form local interactions .",
    "the presence of the orbital component in the spin - wave spectrum then obviously leads to the reduction of the bandwidth .",
    "we believe that this large reduction of the bandwidth can be seen experimentally , in the neutron scattering measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "such experimental results would discriminate between two types of orbital ordering , coo and roo .",
    "unfortunately , at present these experiments are difficult to perform because to measure the full spin - wave spectrum one needs single crystals , which are still not available , as far as we know .",
    "let us now discuss the optical branches .",
    "these modes exist only in the coo state , and they arise from the hybridization between orbital angular momentum non - dispersive levels and dispersive spin branches due to the spin - orbit coupling . in fig.[fig3a ]",
    "we show how the optical gap , @xmath214 , depends on the strength of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "one can see that at @xmath215 , @xmath214 is zero , but it rapidly increases with increasing @xmath64 .    to summarize , the magnetic excitation spectrum for the coo state has two separated branches : quasi acoustic modes and optical modes .",
    "both manifolds are gapped , but the gaps , @xmath212 and @xmath214 have different origins : @xmath212 is set by the anisotropy term , while @xmath214 is set by the spin - orbit coupling and is much larger .",
    "these two gaps could be , in principle , determined by inelastic neutron or raman scattering even in powder samples of znv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "they are also easily distinguishable from the well - known haldane gap , @xmath216 , which is a characteristic feature of the antiferromagnetic @xmath2 chains .",
    "@xmath216 , @xmath212 and @xmath214 have different temperature dependence : the optical gap , @xmath214 , does not depend on the temperature , as it is determined by the relativistic spin - orbit interaction ; the anisotropy gap , @xmath212 , is non - zero only below the temperature of the structural transition , @xmath217 ; and the haldane gap should disappear below @xmath14 , when a long range antiferromagnetic ordering emerges .    at all temperatures ,",
    "the optical gap , @xmath214 , is the largest , so we compare only the anisotropy and the haldane gaps . at the lowest temperatures , @xmath28 , the haldane gap vanishes , and the lowest mode will have a gap equal to an anisotropy gap @xmath212 . at intermediate temperatures , @xmath26 ,",
    "the spin excitations are also gapped .",
    "in this temperature range , the gap is the sum of the anisotropy gap , @xmath212 , and the haldane gap , @xmath216 .",
    "the magnitude of the well - developed haldane gap is of the order of @xmath218 , and is compared to @xmath10 , hence it is very likely that the gap at @xmath26 will be larger then at low temperatures .",
    "this behavior is exotic and , as far as we know , has not been yet observed in @xmath2 spin - chain systems . at high temperatures , @xmath219 ,",
    "the sharp gap is washed out by thermal fluctuations , but the spectrum can still divided into acoustic and optical branches .",
    "we presented in this paper a detail analysis of the magnetic excitations of vanadium spinels , whose low - temperature tetragonal phase can be modeled to a high accuracy by one - dimensional spin chains with weak inter - chain interaction . the formation of antiferromagnetic spin chains on the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice is by itself non - trivial phenomena .",
    "this can happen only because vanadium ions also possess an orbital degree of freedom , and the orbital modulation of the spin exchange partially lifts the geometrical degeneracy of the underlying lattice .",
    "we considered two different ground states : _",
    "i ) _ the one with the real orbital ordering , roo , and _",
    "ii ) _ the one with the complex orbital ordering , coo .",
    "we found that the excitation spectra in these two cases are qualitatively different .",
    "the spectrum for the coo state consists of low lying quasi - acoustic modes with small anisotropy gap and optical branches with zone - center gap determined by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the spectrum for the roo state has only quasi acoustic modes . within the superesxchange model considered in",
    "the present study the spectrum is gapless , however , in reality we expect an anisotropy gap also for this state .",
    "the bandwidth of the quasi - acoustic modes in the coo state is strongly reduced compared to the ones for the roo state , due to contributions from orbital @xmath220-modes .",
    "because the spectra are so different , we argue that an effective way to determine experimentally the symmetry of orbital ordering in vanadium spinels is to measure their magnetic excitation spectrum .                      in the exciton model",
    ", the base object is an enlarged set of pseudoboson operators @xmath226 , whose components @xmath227 and @xmath228 describe transitions to first and second excited levels .",
    "these two vectors are analogous to @xmath229 for pure spin wave model . as a result ,",
    "the matrix @xmath98 is enlarged and becomes a @xmath230 matrix @xmath231 .",
    "its components are given by @xmath232 where @xmath233 here @xmath182 and @xmath234 runs from 1 to 8 .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath235 are zero ( we consider only the case @xmath236 ) , because the diagonal contribution is already included in @xmath178 .                                        y. motome and h. tsunetsugu , prog .",
    ". suppl . * 160 * , 203 ( 2005 ) .",
    "we would like to note that the coupling between third neighbors arise not only due to the direct exchange , but also due to the various super - exchange paths through oxygen ions . in some pyrochlore compounds",
    "this contribution can be rather significant , however , here , for simplicity , we did not take this coupling into account ."
