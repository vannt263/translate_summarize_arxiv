    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the implications of recent experiments @xcite on antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order in upt@xmath0 for the superconducting state .",
    "it is found that ( i ) a very weak afm that sets in at 5 k is multi - domain in structure with a domain size of about @xmath1 , and ( ii ) despite a magnetic moment per u atom of only @xmath2 , the domains can neither be moved nor oriented by magnetic fields upto 3.2 t. we shall show that these findings pose great difficulty for certain widely studied models @xcite in which the superconducting order parameter transforms as one of the two dimensional ( 2d ) represenations of the relevant point group , @xmath3 , and in which the afm ( or even less plausibly , a structural modulation ) provides a symmetry breaking field that splits the superconducting transition into two just as an applied magnetic field splits the a transition in superfluid @xmath4he .",
    "we believe that these data make it overwhelmingly likely that superconducting upt@xmath0 is described by two order parameters belonging to independent representations @xcite , although the precise representations involved are still debatable .    two main experimental facts with which any theory of upt@xmath0 must agree are : ( a ) there are two superconducting transitions at @xmath5 and @xmath6 in zero field @xcite , @xmath7  mk , and @xmath8  mk .",
    "both transitions appear to be of second order , with no observable latent heat .",
    "( b ) for basal - plane magnetic fields , @xmath9 , the phase diagram is isotropic  @xcite ; i.e. , it is the same for all directions of field .",
    "we deliberately do not exploit other facts that also bear on the order parameter symmetry in this paper .",
    "chief among these is that for @xmath9 , there is a tetracritical point in the magnetic field - temperature ( @xmath10-@xmath11 ) plane where four second order lines meet @xcite .",
    "the original 2d models @xcite are incompatible with a tetracritical point unless @xmath12 @xcite , which also argues against them , as the observed phase diagrams for @xmath13 and @xmath14 at @xmath15 to @xmath16 are similar to those for @xmath9 @xcite , although the tetracritical points in these cases may only be apparent ones due to limited resolution of the phase boundaries @xcite .",
    "secondly , a specific @xmath17 model _ is _ compatible with a tetracritical point for all field orientations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to have independent arguments that constrain the order parameter without relying on the presence or absence of tetracritical points .    with this motivation ,",
    "we analyze in this paper the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory for 2d models @xcite when the afm symmetry breaking field is allowed to vary randomly in direction over a length scale @xmath18 .",
    "relative to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an inter - electron distance , and @xmath21 is the coherence length . for upt@xmath0 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , so this region is unobservably small . in particular , the question whether the transition is sharp or smeared out by the random afm is experimentally irrelevant . ]",
    "since the problem involves an order parameter with a continuous symmetry in the presence of a random field , the imry - ma argument  @xcite implies that the long - ranged average of the order parameter itself must vanish .",
    "other forms of order are not ruled out , however , and a balance of gradient and field orientation energies shows  @xcite that there are two transitions , the upper one of second order , and the lower one of first order .",
    "if one is only interested in global properties of the phase diagram and the universality class of the transitions , there is nothing more to be said .",
    "we are more interested in whether or not this scenario could describe the experimental data on upt@xmath0 . to this end",
    "we calculate the latent heat at the lower transition assuming that the coupling to antiferromagnetism is weak .",
    "we find that this is too large to have been missed by the experiments @xcite if the splitting is taken to equal the observed value .",
    "in other words , we can dismiss the possibility that the lower transition seen experimentally is of first order with an unobservably small latent heat .",
    "a second possibile explanation for the data ( which arises when the afm coupling is not weak ) is that the two transitions predicted by the theory are too close to be resolved , and that the lower specific heat jump is actually due to a cross - over and not a true transition .",
    "we exclude this possibility too . using a simple periodic model for the afm domain structure ,",
    "we find that the observed @xmath24 slopes @xcite and the 300   domain size imply that a sufficiently sharp cross - over must be accompanied with a @xmath25 of order 80  k , which is clearly absurd .    to orient the discussion further , let us review how the 2d models account for facts a and b when the afm is uniform .",
    "the gl free energy @xmath26 for all these models can be written in terms of a vector @xmath27 with complex components . in zero magnetic field @xmath26",
    "is the sum of bulk , gradient , and symmetry breaking field terms : @xmath28 here , @xmath29 , and the summation convention is used , @xmath30 is the basal - plane unit vector along the magnetic moments , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are all positive .",
    "( if @xmath34 , there is only one transition , and the model can not describe upt@xmath0 . )",
    "suppose @xmath35 everywhere .",
    "then the first transition occurs at @xmath36 to a phase with @xmath37 . ignoring the global phase @xmath38",
    ", we refer to this as the real or ( 1,0 ) phase .",
    "it breaks the rotational symmetry of the normal state .",
    "the second transition occurs at @xmath39 to a phase with @xmath40 where @xmath41 is real and grows smoothly from 0 to @xmath42 as @xmath11 is lowered further .",
    "this phase breaks rotational and time reversal symmetry , and we shall refer to it as the axial or the @xmath43 phase .",
    "this explains fact a. to explain fact b , it is necessary in the original 2d models @xcite to assume that the symmetry breaking field rotates in response to the applied magnetic field .",
    "a symmetry breaking perturbation that was locked to the lattice would split the @xmath19 s , but would not yield an isotropic basal - plane phase diagram .",
    "in particular , the tetracritical point would not exist for some @xmath44 orientations .",
    ", also can not be a viable symmetry breaking field .",
    "] this assumption was justified by hypothesizing @xcite that the afm anisotropy energy was so weak that the nel vector reoriented itself to stay perpendicular to the magnetic field even for relatively small @xmath10 , and this idea has even been refined @xcite to explain the minute anisotropy of @xmath24 found by keller et al .",
    ".    the neutron scattering data of lussier et al .",
    "@xcite directly refute the above hypothesis .",
    "they find that an afm domain is of average size @xmath45  @xcite , raises doubts whether the afm is static long range order ; we set these doubts aside here as they make the 2d models even more problematic . ] and is associated with one of three choices for the spin density wavevector @xmath46 , with @xmath47 .",
    "the scattering intensity under the peaks with different @xmath48 s is essentially unchanged by fields of up to 3.2 t , for either @xmath49 or @xmath50 , and in both field - cooled and zero - field - cooled experiments . in addition , application of a field causes no transfer of intensity to a scattering wave vector @xmath51 which is forbidden ( because @xmath52 ) when @xmath53 .",
    "this shows that the moments do not ca nt away from the @xmath48 direction while preserving the wavevectors .",
    "why , given these data , should one further investigate the 2d models ?",
    "one reason is the modified 2d model @xcite . in this model , @xmath54 , and the afm",
    "is assumed to split the @xmath55 term into @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are components of @xmath59 parallel and perpendicular to @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "( a similar splitting is assumed for @xmath62 . )",
    "note that the afm continues to couple directly to the order parameter as described by eq .",
    "( [ fsbf ] ) .",
    "the linearized gl equations for @xmath57 and @xmath58 then decouple even when @xmath63 , and an isotropic basal - plane phase diagram is recovered even if the afm is rigidly locked to the lattice .",
    "however , the random afm excludes this model too , as the scaling of gradient and field orientation energies with @xmath64 , and the overall balance between them , is unchanged .",
    "a second reason is that although the general thrust of the imry - ma argument @xcite must continue to hold , the problem for upt@xmath0 is not directly equivalent to an @xmath65-component vector spin model , and we are unaware of any specific analysis for it . in particular we know of no careful comparison of the energetics of the axial phase versus a real state with a wandering axis of orientation .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the gl free energy is analyzed in sec .",
    "we perform a variational analysis to understand the nature of the short - range order at the upper transition , and also calculate the latent heat at the lower transition .",
    "the simple periodic model is analysed in sec .",
    "iii . a brief discussion in sec .",
    "iv concludes the paper .",
    "we wish to minimize the gl free energy , which is still given by eqs .",
    "( [ fbulk][fsbf ] ) , but @xmath66 is now @xmath67 dependent with a correlation length @xmath68 .",
    "we first simplify the gradient energy to @xmath69 as we are interested only in the competition between the gradient and the symmetry breaking energies , and not in the precise slopes of the @xmath24 lines and whether they cross or not . along and perpendicular to @xmath60",
    "is now slightly different , but it is , nevertheless , always positive . any suitable average for the gradient energy scale @xmath70 therefore suffices for the scaling arguments that follow . ]",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath71 , and introduce the gradient energy scale @xmath72 , and circular polarization components , @xmath73 .",
    "the first step is to find the critical temperature @xmath19 , and the nature of the critical order parameter . to do this we drop the quartic terms in @xmath26 , and minimize the rest",
    "this yields an eigenvalue problem given by the linearized gl equations : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the @xmath19 _ enhancement_. the critical solution is that with the _ largest _ value of @xmath76 .    two qualitatively different types of solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ evl ] ) and ( [ evr ] ) are as follows .",
    "the first , or local solution , is motivated by the answer for uniform @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "then @xmath59 is also uniform , the gradient terms vanish , and we get @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "if we now require @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath81 , even when @xmath77 is varying , then we pick up a gradient energy of the order of @xmath70 , and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a number of order one , and @xmath84 denotes a spatial average .",
    "this solution does well only when @xmath85 , i.e. , when the symmetry breaking energy is dominant .",
    "the second , or real solution , has the form @xmath86 , @xmath87 being a real unit vector varying on a length @xmath88 . the gradient energy is clearly of order @xmath89 . a random walk argument for symmetry breaking energy leads to the estimate @xmath90 . minimizing the sum of these two energies ,",
    "we obtain @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "this solution requires @xmath93 for consistency , and the @xmath19 enhancement is strongly reduced compared to the uniform case .",
    "a correct estimate of the symmetry breaking energy for the real solution is more subtle , however .",
    "although long range order in @xmath59 is forbidden , it is not obvious that the estimate of the energy itself is correct , as one could try and lower it by short range adjustment to the local value of @xmath94 .",
    "indeed , we will find that though the @xmath19 _ splitting _ is governed by the @xmath95 energy gain , this gain is subdominant to that due to the short - ranged order , and the _ enhancement _ in @xmath19 itself is larger , of order @xmath96 .",
    "the above results follow from a variational argument , which we present in three stages . in the first stage , let us consider the trial wave function @xmath97 , @xmath98 , with @xmath99 as a variational parameter .",
    "we call this the axial solution .",
    "( see reasons below . )",
    "the optimal value of @xmath99 is to be found by minimizing @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the linear operator , or gl  hamiltonian \" in eq .",
    "( [ evl ] ) and ( [ evr ] ) , @xmath102 is the trial solution , and we use an obvious quantum mechanical notation for the averages . a simple calculation gives @xmath103 [ the quantity @xmath83 as before .",
    "] minimization gives a @xmath19 enhancement @xmath104 , which is @xmath105 for @xmath106 , and @xmath107 when @xmath85 .",
    "we have thus done better than both the local and the real solutions .    in the second stage ,",
    "we generalize the above solution by taking @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a variational kernel .",
    "we take @xmath110 to be gaussian - distributed , with @xmath111 , and a correlation function @xmath112 decaying on a length scale @xmath113 .",

    "setting the variation of @xmath126 to zero , we obtain @xmath127 using @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 for @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and  @xmath133 , respectively , and cancelling @xmath119 in this equation , we get @xmath134 - ( 2\\epsilon f_1 + \\kappa f_2)q(\\bk ) = 0 .",
    "\\label{mincond}\\ ] ] this yields the yukawa - like form @xmath135 where @xmath136 is self - consistently given by @xmath137 in the last form , which follows by comparison with eq .",

    "( [ k0 ] ) to obtain @xmath140 and @xmath138 .",
    "since @xmath141 decays on a length scale @xmath113 , we expect @xmath142 to decay on a scale @xmath143 .",
    "since @xmath144 , this decay must be faster than @xmath145 as @xmath146 ; this fact will guarantee convergence of the integrals below .",
    "for @xmath147 we obtain @xmath148 now , by the second equality in eq .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) , we expect @xmath140 to vanish as @xmath149 .",
    "it is therefore valid to put @xmath140 to zero in the integrand above .",
    "this yields @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a dimensionless number of order unity . in the same way",
    ", we get @xmath152 where the last result follows from again setting @xmath153 in the integrand .",
    "lastly , @xmath154 is given by @xmath155 it is impermissible to set @xmath153 now as the resulting integral is divergent .",
    "instead , we note that the integrand is sharply peaked near @xmath156 , and use this fact to replace @xmath142 by @xmath157 .",
    "this yields @xmath158 where @xmath159 is another dimensionless number of order unity .",
    "we will show shortly that @xmath160 .",
    "( this is also to be expected from the fact that @xmath161 . ) assuming this to be the case , using eqs .",
    "( [ f1ans ] ) and ( [ f2ans ] ) , and neglecting @xmath154 in comparison with unity in eq .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) , we obtain @xmath162 @xmath163 it then follows that @xmath164 self - consistently .",
    "the assumption @xmath165 is also seen to be true .",
    "although the @xmath19 enhancement is still of order @xmath96 , we can see that it exceeds that obtained with the earlier simple trial solution by noting that the quantity @xmath166 can be written as the product @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is a mean defined with respect to the distribution @xmath169 .",
    "the desired result then follows from noting that @xmath170 , i.e. , @xmath171 , either as a consequence of hlder s inequality , or by recalling that the arithmetic mean of positive numbers with a non - zero spread always exceeds the harmonic mean .",
    "further , the solution is non - perturbative since @xmath172 , which is not an integer power of @xmath64 .",
    "the improvement over the real solution is illusory , however .",
    "first , note that the axial solution is degenerate , since if @xmath173 is a solution to eqs .",
    "( [ evl ] ) and ( [ evr ] ) , so is @xmath174 .",
    "( this is merely complex conjugation . ) since @xmath175 for eq .",
    "( [ etvar ] ) , these are distinct solutions . on the other hand ,",
    "the gl equations are seen to be completely real when written in terms of @xmath176 and @xmath177 , suggesting that the ground state is also real and unique .",
    "has no symmetries ( including time - reversal ) with a random afm .",
    "thus this argument does not apply to the periodic model studied in in sec .",
    "thus a linear combination of the solution just found with its complex conjugate might be even lower in energy .",
    "the second point is that the length scale @xmath178 is much less than the imry - ma length scale @xmath179 .",
    "thus the axial order found above is only short - ranged , and we can multiply the variational answer by a phase factor @xmath180 varying on a length scale greater than @xmath181 and try to further reduce the energy in this way .",
    "this forms the third stage of our argument .",
    "we denote the solution ( [ etvar ] ) by @xmath182 , its complex conjugate by @xmath183 , and examine the combination @xmath184 this has cartesian components @xmath185 since @xmath186 , this solution is close to @xmath187 , i.e. , to a rotation of the @xmath188 solution . if @xmath189 were a constant , the energy would be identical to that of the solution ( [ etvar ] ) , i.e. , given by eq .",
    "( [ wans ] ) . to calculate the difference ,",
    "let us define @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",

    "we can now apply the imry - ma argument to eq .",
    "( [ fcg ] ) .",
    "suppose the energy is minimized when @xmath189 varies on a length scale @xmath197 . in a supercell of linear size @xmath197 , there are approximately @xmath198 cells in each of which @xmath199 can be regarded as constant and independent of the other cells .",
    "thus the coarse grained average of either @xmath200 or @xmath201 in a supercell is a number of order @xmath202 of either sign . by choosing @xmath203 , and @xmath204",
    ", we obtain a symmetry breaking energy which is systematically negative in every supercell .",
    "since the gradient energy is of order @xmath205 , we recover the imry - ma length scale @xmath206 , and an energy lowering of @xmath207 .",
    "this energy is _ subdominant _ to the gain ( [ wans ] ) from the short ranged order of eq .",
    "( [ etvar ] ) , but since it represents an additional gain , the true solution is indeed disordered and real .",
    "it is in this sense that the real solution must be understood .",
    "therefore , the transition temperature for the real solution is given by @xmath208 ( actually , @xmath209 could also contain a term of order @xmath210 , but that is immaterial . )",
    "let us now consider what happens at lower temperatures . now",
    "the quartic terms come into play , and the positive @xmath33 term in @xmath192 favors an axial solution . for @xmath211 , we can compare the free energies of the real and axial solutions directly . since @xmath212 vanishes for a purely axial solution and equals @xmath213 for a purely real one , these free energies will differ strongly in the contribution of the @xmath33 term . approximating multiplicative factors such as @xmath214 by unity , and denoting real and axial solution quantitites by subscripts @xmath215 and @xmath113 , the standard analysis of a landau free energy with a second order transition yields @xmath216 where @xmath217 the @xmath218 s are specific heats that would be obtained for the respective solutions .",

    "the latent heat predicted by the 2d models is much larger .",

    "the system will lower its gradient energy by tunneling of the @xmath177 component through the intervening domain .",
    "since the @xmath59 component parallel to @xmath94 is exponentially small in the ratio @xmath249 , we expect the magnitude of the gradient energy gain will also be similarly small . however , the gradient energy favors relatively real @xmath176 and @xmath177 , while the @xmath33 term favors a relative phase of @xmath250 between them .",
    "general symmetry and continuity arguments would suggest that we still have two phase transitions with the lower one of first - order , but now the @xmath19-splitting , and the degree of axiality at the lower transition will be exponentially small .",
    "it is then conceivable that an appreciably axiality only develops as a crossover at a lower temperature .",
    "this raises the possibility that the two true phase transitions are so close together that they appear to be one experimentally , and the crossover appears to be the phase transition at a lower temperature .    to investigate the above possibility",

    "the surprising result from this exercise is that one might have expected a crossover and an apparent @xmath19 splitting of order @xmath31 to appear for @xmath274 , say .",
    "this is not so , and the crossover is only manifest at a much larger value of @xmath249 .",
    "we have considered the effect of the short ranged antiferromagnetic domain structure on the superconducting transition in upt@xmath0 within the 2d models , wherein the antiferromagnetism is the agency that splits the transition .",
    "it is known  @xcite that when the afm is weak and random , one does obtain two transitions but the lower one is of first order .",
    "we have shown that this prediction is in _ quantitative _ conflict with observations by calculating the latent heat at this transition , and showing that if the @xmath19 splitting and the specific heats are to agree with the observed data , then this latent heat is well above experimental limits on detectability . in the course of this analysis we have studied a variational axial state to better understand the short - ranged order .",
    "we have also studied the possibility that the lower transition may be a cross - over and not a true phase transition . in this case , the observed @xmath19 splitting can not be reconciled with the gradient energy scale . in either case , the afm domain structure rules out all 2d models @xcite .    finally , we briefly disuss experiments which show that the two transitions in upt@xmath0 merge into one at a pressure of @xmath275  kbar @xcite .",
    "the loose interpretation that this happens because the antiferromagnetism disappears at about the same pressure is thermodynamically unsustainable @xcite .",
    "all mean field models , whether based on one @xcite or two @xcite primary order parameers , require either the reemergence of a splitting for @xmath276 , or a first order line at @xmath277 .",
    "neither possibility has been ruled out so far in our view , as the broad heat capacity anomalies seen in @xcite could conceal two transitions , and a first order transition has not been looked for .",
    "careful experimental study of these possibilities is clearly highly desirable . at present , we believe that the two - order - parameter models , especially the ab model @xcite , are the only viable ones left for describing upt@xmath0 .    some of this work was done while visiting the universitt augsburg , germany , and the institute for scientific interchange , torino , italy , and i thank my hosts at both institutions for their hospitality .",
