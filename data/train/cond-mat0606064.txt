    "over the years , there has been a series of controversies regarding the properties of the ferroelastic compound rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 . initially designated as lirb@xmath7(so@xmath0)@xmath81.5h@xmath8so@xmath0 @xcite",
    ", subsequent chemical analysis revealed that rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 is the proper description .",
    "it was also suggested that rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 belongs to the @xmath9 point group in the paraelastic phase at ambient temperature .",
    "consequently , a @xmath10 symmetry change , associated with a ferroelastic phase transition at 134  k , was assumed@xcite .",
    "additional x - ray@xcite and neutron diffraction@xcite measurements finally established that the proper group - subgroup symmetry change is actually @xmath11 . based on this new phase sequence , the elastic properties of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 have been revisited using brillouin scattering@xcite and ultrasonic@xcite measurements . both experimental approaches",
    "now confirmed that the effective elastic constant @xmath12 softens as the temperature is reduced to @xmath13 , which is perfectly compatible with a @xmath11 phase transition .",
    "nonetheless , in order to explain their respective findings , each group proposed models which are fundamentally different . on the one hand , the ultrasonic measurements@xcite , which show a sudden drop at @xmath13 in the velocity of longitudinal modes propagating along [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] , are interpreted within the framework of a pseudo - proper ferroelastic model .",
    "consequently , the authors assume that the order parameter is not one of the strains or a combination of strain components .",
    "however , in that case the order parameter must at least exhibit the same symmetry as the strain @xmath14 or @xmath15@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "mrz et al.@xcite claim that rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 shows incomplete softening at @xmath13 and proposed a model which they claim is consistent with that observation . in their paper , rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 is described as a proper ferroelastic compound where the strain combination @xmath16 acts as the order parameter .",
    "incomplete softening in ferroelastic crystals is not a common phenomena , but it has previously been observed in bivo@xmath0@xcite . in that case , the softening is mediated by the coupling between optical and acoustical modes .",
    "considering that the model proposed by mrz et al.@xcite includes no such coupling term , we believe that their conclusion regarding the soft mode rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 requires further investigation . thus , in order to clarify the nature of the ferroelastic transition , as well as , to validate or refute the possibility of incomplete softening in rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 , we present a detailed investigation of the elastic properties of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 as a function of temperature and pressure . we also compare the predictions of a proper and a pseudo - proper ferroelastic models in order to ascertain the character of the ferroelastic transition in rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 .",
    "the rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 crystal was grown by the crystal physics laboratory of the institute of physics at mickiewicz university , poland@xcite . for the ultrasonic investigation ,",
    "several samples in the form of cubes of about @xmath17 were used to measure the sound velocity along different crystallographic directions .",
    "longitudinal and transversal waves were generated and detected using 30  mhz lithium niobate transducers mounted on one face of the crystal .",
    "the relative variations in the sound velocity ( @xmath18 ) were obtained using a high - resolution pulsed acoustic interferometer as a function of temperature and pressure . for measurements realized at high pressure ,",
    "the transducer - sample assemblage was inserted in a cu - be pressure cell filled with a 3-methyl-1-butanol fluid acting as the pressure - transmitting medium .",
    "a small wire of lead mounted close to the sample was used during the experiments to determine the actual pressure at different temperatures .",

    "in addition , the miller index adjacent to the label t gives the polarization of the mode while the other index corresponds to the direction of propagation .",
    "for example , @xmath19}[100]$ ] stands for the velocity of transverse wave propagating along the crystallographic direction [ 100 ] with its polarization along [ 001 ] . using that notation",

    "let first point out that our results are very consistent with previous studies@xcite realized as a function of temperature .",

    "the inset shows the pressure dependence of the ferroelastic critical temperature @xmath13 for rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 .",
    "[ c33atp ] ]",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ c33atp ] show that the temperature dependence just below the critical temperature changes significantly between ambient pressure and a moderate pressure of @xmath27  kbar .",
    "we believe that this might be an indication that the observed temperature dependence in the ferroelastic state is not purely intrinsic .",
    "one of the characteristic of ferroelastic compounds is that structural domains appear in the ferroelastic phase .",
    "moreover for soft ferroelastic materials , it is possible to switch the orientation of these domains by applying an uniaxial stress . in the case of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 ,",
    "the domains have been observed@xcite and consist of two mutually perpendicular walls .",
    "considering that the pressure is not perfectly isotropic in pressure cell , the unusual behavior of the velocity close to @xmath13 might be associated with a modification of the domain structure with increasing pressure .",
    "consequently , before attempting to analyze any results in the ferroelastic phase , it is crucial to determine what might be the influences of these domains on the measured quantities .",
    "thus , in order to ascertain if our measurements represent the intrinsic elastic properties of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 , we compare in fig .",

    "the fact that both sets of data are practically identical below @xmath13 indicates that the size of the domains is smaller then our acoustic wavelength ( @xmath30 ) at 30  mhz .",
    "thus , based on this comparison , it is clear that our results obtained in the ferroelastic phase , as well as those obtained by breczewski et al .",
    "@xcite , do not reflect the intrinsic elastic properties of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 .",
    "for that reason , the landau models presented in the appendix are tested using results obtained principally in the paraelastic phase ( tetragonal phase ) .",
    "so far , the elastic properties of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 have been qualitatively analyzed by different groups@xcite using two different landau - type models . in one case",
    ", they consider that the order parameter corresponds to the strains @xmath31 and @xmath15 ( proper ferroelastic ) while in the other scenario the order parameter is unknown but has the same symmetry as the strains mentioned previously ( pseudo - ferroelastic ) . in this paper",
    ", we present ( see appendix ) a comprehensive derivation of a proper and pseudo - proper models for a @xmath11 ferroelastic phase transition .",
    "both of these models are derived using a minimum number of coupling factors .",
    "our principal goal is to see if one could determine the true nature of the order parameter based on a detailed analysis of the elastic properties of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 .    according to both models derived in the appendix ( see eq .",
    "[ ciit ] and eq .",
    "[ ciitproper ] ) , the elastic constants @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are expected to soften while @xmath35 becomes stiffer as @xmath13 is approached from above ( or approach @xmath25 from below ) .",
    "the main qualitative difference between these models is that the softening and stiffening are expected to be linear for a proper ferroelastic transition while it could be non - linear in the other case . using the relations given in reference [ 10 ] and our high resolution velocity measurements , it is easy to determine the temperature and pressure dependence of the principal elastic constants .",
    "considering that the value of @xmath33 is an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath32@xcite , we can consider , as a reasonable approximation , that the temperature and pressure dependence of @xmath32 is captured by that of @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "thus , our high resolution measurements indicate that @xmath32 indeed softens , however , its temperature and pressure dependence are significantly non - linear .     and the isomorphic compound @xmath37 using the temperature dependence of @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath38$].[vrb4andk4 ] ]    this first constatation is reinforced by a comparison of the velocity measurements performed on @xmath39 and the isomorphic compound @xmath37 .",
    "as @xmath37 shows no ferroelastic transition@xcite , it can be used to accurately determined the anharmonic temperature dependence of the elastic constants in the absence of softening due to the transition . as an example , we compare in fig .",
    "[ vrb4andk4 ] the results obtained for longitudinal modes propagating along the @xmath40 and @xmath28 directions . along the @xmath40-direction",
    ", we note that both compounds have the same absolute velocity at room temperature and exhibit the same temperature dependence .",
    "this is consistent with both models as no influence of the soft mode is expected on @xmath41 in the para - elastic phase . along the @xmath28-direction",
    ", the comparison of @xmath36 $ ] for these two compounds indicates that the contribution associated with the soft mode is indeed non - linear and thus more compatible with the pseudo - ferroelastic description .",
    "so far , our qualitative observations seem to indicate that the elastic properties of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 are more consistent with the predictions based on pseudo - ferroelastic model .",
    "a more rigorous test can be performed by carrying on a detailed numerical comparison using the prediction giving in the appendix .",
    "while the elastic constants are determined by sound velocity measurements realized at room temperature , the magnitude of the coupling terms , as well as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , need to be determined independently .",
    "moreover , it is also important to determine the anharmonic contributions which are independent of the transition . in the case of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0",
    ", these contributions have been determined from velocity measurements performed on the isomorphic compound @xmath37 .",
    "finally , let mention that both models include only eight adjustable parameters and that six of them are determined independently using the temperature dependence of the strains , the pressure dependence of @xmath13 ( @xmath44 = 19.1  k / kbar ) , and the normalization of the order parameter .",
    "the last two parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which only influence @xmath47 and @xmath48 , can be set manually . to illustrate how stringent this process is , we present in fig .",

    "the agreement between the prediction of the pseudo - proper model and experimental results , as a function of temperature and pressure , is quite remarkable ( within of percent ) .",
    "naturally , the agreement in the ferroelastic phase is not as good considering that the elastic properties are significantly affected by the existence of structural domains below t@xmath6 . as an ultimate test",
    ", we compare in fig .",
    "[ vsofttheo ] the predictions of the proper model ( dash line ) and the pseudo - proper model ( continuous line ) relative to experimental data showing the largest variation .",
    "these variations are obtained using transverse modes propagating in the xy plane at an angle @xmath49 relative to the [ 110 ] direction ( with @xmath50 ) with its polarization in the xy plane . from that comparison ,",
    "it is clear that we systematically obtain a better agreement with the pseudo - proper model rather than the proper ferroelastic model . in fig .",

    ", the continuous and dash lines correspond to predictions based on a pseudo and proper ferroelastic models presented in the appendix.[vsofttheo ] ]    the data presented in fig .",
    "[ vsofttheo ] also confirms a larger softening as the direction of propagation , for transverse mode polarized in the xy plane , is a few degrees away from the [ 110 ] direction ( approximately @xmath52 relative to the @xmath20 $ ] direction ) .",
    "this observation complies with previous brillouin scattering measurements@xcite which show less softening as the direction of propagation is changed toward [ 010 ] instead of [ 100 ] .",
    "however , in their data analysis , they also claim that rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 shows incomplete softening at @xmath13 , a claim that we revisit in this section .",
    "the effective modulus for the soft acoustic mode of a @xmath11 ferroelastic phase transition can be obtained by finding the eigenvalues of the submatrix corresponding to the strain components @xmath31 and @xmath15 , @xmath53 we would like to point out that the submatrix used here differs from the one published by boccara@xcite . considering that elastic tensors must be symmetric , it is obvious that some of the results found in boccara@xcite are inexact and that they correspond to simple topographic errors .",
    "thus , contrary to the expression used by mroz et al.@xcite , which was derived from expressions found in boccara@xcite , the appropriate relation for the soft modulus is    @xmath54    while the associated direction of propagation@xcite is given by @xmath55 where the angle @xmath49 is defined relative the [ 110 ] direction . using the measured elastic constants of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 at room temperature , the expected direction for the soft mode should correspond to @xmath56 .",
    "this prediction ( @xmath57 relative to the x - axis ) agrees well with the orientations of the domain walls observed in the ferroelastic phase@xcite . as that direction",
    "does not coincide with any of the principal crystallographic directions , this has contributed to delay the experimental determination of the actual soft mode in rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 . according to our recent investigation , the data obtained at @xmath58 indicate a larger variation relative to the results obtained at @xmath59 , which is very consistent with the numerical prediction . unfortunately , due to a rapid increases in the acoustic attenuation close to @xmath13 , we were not able to perform the measurement down to @xmath13",
    ". nevertheless , considering that the theoretical prediction based on the pseudo ferroelastic model agree well with our experimental data , we believe that within the experimental uncertainties there is no strong evidence of incomplete softening in rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 .",
    "thus , it is clear , based on the results presented in this section , that the conclusion reached by mroz et al.@xcite is inexact .",
    "in this investigation , we have presented a detailed analysis of the elastic properties of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 . a substantial set of experimental data , obtained as a function of temperature and pressure , is compared to two landau models associated with a @xmath2 ferroelastic phase transition .",
    "the possible scenarios considered here correspond to the proper ferroelastic case where the instability is driven by the strains while in the pseudo - proper situation the order parameter is unknown . in the later case ,",
    "even the order parameter is unknown , its symmetry must be identical to the order parameter defined for the proper ferroelastic case .",
    "both models are derived using a minimum number of coupling parameters which are adjusted from thermal expansion data@xcite and the pressure dependence of the critical temperature @xmath60 obtained in this work .",
    "our analysis clearly shows that within the frame work of the pseudo - proper ferroelastic model , it is possible to obtain predictions that are simultaneously consistent with the temperature and pressure dependence of the elastic constants , the pressure dependence of @xmath13 and thermal expansion .",
    "no such quantitative agreement is obtained using the proper ferroelastic model .",
    "thus , as suggested by our investigation , rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 should be consider as a pseudo - proper ferroelastic compound .",
    "if our conclusion is accurate , this implies that the nature of the order parameter , driving the ferroelastic transition in rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 , is still unknown .",
    "so far , there has been a limited number of raman scattering measurements on rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0@xcite .",
    "however , even if they observed a soft optical b mode , the authors of ref .  15 claim that the variation of that particular mode is insufficient to account for the transition .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that , in the presence of linear coupling between acoustical and optical modes@xcite , while the actual transition takes place at t@xmath6 , the extrapolated temperature dependence of the soft optical energy in the paraelastic phase is expected to vanish at a temperature t@xmath61 .",
    "based on our numerical predictions , @xmath62 is approximately equal to 20  k in the case of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 .",
    "we believe that further investigations are certainly necessary in order to clarify the nature of the actual mode responsible for the ferroelastic transition in rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 .    finally , as we have clearly demonstrated in this paper , there is no strong experimental evidence that rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 show incomplete softening of the soft elastic constant at @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , the ferroelastic character of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 is not necessary unique , for example , its properties seem very similar to those of ( nh@xmath0)@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 which shows a @xmath11 ferroelastic phase transition at 236  k@xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to use a similar numerical analysis in order to determine the nature of that ferroelastic transition .",
    "the direct group - subgroup relationship for the @xmath11 ferroelastic phase transition imposes that the spontaneous strain@xcite associated with this transition must correspond to the combination @xmath63 .",
    "this effective strain can then act as the principal order parameter ( proper ferroelastic transition ) or couple bilinearly to the order parameter q. in the later case , the order parameter q could correspond to the softening of an optical phonon and the phase transformation is then referred to as a pseudoproper ferroelastic transition@xcite . even if there is no direct evidence of a soft optical mode in rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0@xcite , this later scenario should not be dismissed .",
    "as we show in this paper , these two types of ferroelastic transition should in principle produce subtle differences in the elastic properties of rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 .",
    "the predictions , derived from the models presented in the next section , are then compared to our experimental data in order to determine whether rb@xmath0lih@xmath1(so@xmath0)@xmath0 should be regarded as a proper or pseudo - proper ferroelastic compound .      considering that we are particularly interested in the pressure and temperature dependence of the elastic properties , we express the gibbs free energy into four distinct contributions such as @xmath64 here , @xmath65 is the usual second - order landau - type free energy in terms of an order parameter q , @xmath66 where @xmath67 depends explicitly on temperature while the pressure contribution is introduced in @xmath68 of eq .",
    "[ eq : ftotal ] . in the presence of external stresses",
    "@xmath69 , this contribution is normally written as @xmath70 . in the case of an hydrostatic pressure p",
    "the stress associated with longitudinal strains ( @xmath71 = 1 , 2 , 3 ) corresponds to @xmath72 while for shear strains @xmath73 ( @xmath74 = 4 , 5 , 6 ) , hence @xmath75 this contribution is crucial in order to calculate the pressure dependence of the elastic constants as well as to determine the pressure dependence of the critical temperature .",
    "furthermore , this is achieved without adding any additional adjustable parameters .",
    "the elastic energy @xmath76 is also straightforward to derive as it is imposed by the symmetry of the high temperature phase .",
    "thus , for a point group 4 symmetry@xcite @xmath77 where c@xmath78 represent the bare elastic constants at high temperatures . finally , the most critical term corresponds to the coupling energy @xmath79 which takes into account the coupling between the strain components @xmath80 and the order parameter q. for a @xmath11 pseudo - proper ferroelastic transition , we know that the order parameter @xmath81 must transform as the spontaneous strain @xmath82 under the symmetry operations of the high temperature phase .",
    "thus , using fundamental symmetry arguments , the coupling terms considered in this paper are    @xmath83    here , we only consider terms which are fully compatible with a @xmath11 structural transformation . the gibbs energy , as defined in this paper ( eq .",
    "[ eq : ftotal]-[eq : fc ] ) , gives a phenomenological framework which can now be used in order to derive the elastic properties of a @xmath11 pseudo - proper ferroelastic compound . from the minimization of the gibbs energy with respect to @xmath80 , we obtain a series of expressions for the spontaneous strains @xmath84 . at ambient pressure",
    "these relations correspond to @xmath85 as @xmath14 and @xmath15 display the same symmetry characteristic as q , it is then natural to find that they are proportional to q. we also obtain that @xmath86 which is again compatible with a @xmath87 symmetry change .",
    "furthermore , using the minimization with respect to the order parameter q , the corresponding expressions for the order parameter q , the critical temperature @xmath13 and its pressure dependence can be written as @xmath88 where    @xmath89    finally , the elastic constants are calculated using@xcite @xmath90 according to this model , the elastic tensor associated with the tetragonal 4 phase is @xmath91 while the corresponding tensor for the monoclinic 2 phase is @xmath92 with @xmath93    a rapid inspection of the elastic tensor , corresponding to the solution below @xmath13 ( or above @xmath25 ) , indicates that its form is consistent with the elastic tensor of the monoclinic class 2 .",
    "this indicates that the coupling terms considered in the gibbs energy includes all terms which are fully compatible with a @xmath11 symmetry change .      in the case of a proper ferroelastic model ,",
    "the derivation is slightly different .",
    "we can still write the gibbs energy , the landau energy , and the elastic energy as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : ftotal ] - eq .  [ eq : lq ] , and eq .  [ eq : fel ] , respectively . the main difference being that the order parameter q now corresponds to a strain combination defined as @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the coupling terms invariant with respect to the high temperature symmetry are    @xmath95    using the minimization of the gibbs energy with respect to @xmath80 , the solutions for @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath44 remain identical to those obtained for the pseudo - proper case while @xmath100 finally , as that the gibbs energy is now only a function of strains , the elastic constants are directly obtained using @xmath101 thus , in the case a @xmath11 proper ferroelastic transition , the elastic tensor for the paraelastic phase is given by @xmath102    where @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the temperature and pressure dependence of the elastic constants should be linear .",
    "this differs from the pseudo - proper model where the variation in the elastic constants is expected to be inversely proportional to @xmath104 .",
