    "a convincing theoretical explanation of this new @xmath1li plateau turned out to be problematic : the high abundances of @xmath1li at the lowest metallicities can not be explained by current models of galactic cosmic - ray production , even if the depletion of @xmath1li during the pre - main - sequence phase is ignored ( see reviews by e.g.   ( * ? ? ?",

    "they have been obtained from realistic numerical simulations with the co@xmath0bold code which solves the time - dependent equations of compressible hydrodynamics in a constant gravity field together with the equations of non - local , frequency - dependent radiative transfer in a cartesian box representative of a volume located at the stellar surface .",

    "each of the models is represented by a number of snapshots , indicated in column ( 6 ) , chosen from the full time sequence of the corresponding simulation .",
    "these representative snapshots are processed by the non - lte code nlte3d that solves the statistical equilibrium equations for a 17 level lithium atom with 34 line transitions , fully taking into account the 3d thermal structure of the respective model atmosphere .",

    "finally , 3d nlte synthetic line profiles of the lii @xmath26    doublet are computed with the line formation code linfor3d ( http://www.aip.de/@xmath9mst/linfor3d_main.html ) , using the departure coefficients @xmath27=@xmath28 provided by nlte3d for each level @xmath29 of the lithium model atom as a function of geometrical position within the 3d model atmospheres . as demonstrated in fig.[fig1 ] , 3d nlte effects are very important for the metal - poor dwarfs considered here : they strongly reduce the height range of line formation such that the 3d nlte equivalent width is smaller by roughly a factor 2 compared to 3d lte .",
    "ironically , the line strength predicted by standard 1d mixing - length models in lte are close to the results obtained from elaborate 3d nlte calculations .",
    "we note that the half - width of the 3d nlte line profile , fwhm(nlte)=8.5  km / s , is larger by about 10% : fwhm(lte)=@xmath30 and @xmath31  km / s , respectively , before and after reducing the li abundance such that 3d lte and 3d nlte equivalent widths agree .",
    "this is because 3d lte profile senses the higher photosphere where both thermal and hydrodynamical velocities are lower .",

    "the @xmath1li/@xmath2li isotopic ratio derived from fitting of the lii doublet with 3d nlte synthetic line profiles is shown to be about 1% to 2% lower than what is obtained with 1d lte profiles .",
    "based on this result , we conclude that only @xmath35 out of the @xmath36 stars of the @xcite sample would remain significant @xmath1li detections when subjected to a 3d  non - lte analysis , suggesting that the presence of @xmath1li in the atmospheres of galactic halo stars is rather the exception than the rule , and hence does not necessarily constitute a _ cosmological _ @xmath1li problem .",
    "if we adopt the approach by @xcite , relying on additional spectral lines to fix the residual line broadening , the difference between 3d nlte and 1d lte results increases even more , as far as we can judge from our case study hd74000 . until the 3d nlte effects are fully understood for all involved lines , we consider this method as potentially dangerous ."
