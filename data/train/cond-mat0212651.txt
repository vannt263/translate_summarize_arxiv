    "recent experimental work @xcite has demonstrated the importance of correlations in determining the low temperature transport properties of nanoscale size quantum dots .",
    "these dots consists of a confined region of electrons , of typical diameter @xmath0 , `` weakly '' coupled to leads via tunnel barriers .",
    "a `` weak '' coupling , @xmath1 , means that the quantized levels of the dot are broadened into resonances , but are not completely washed out .",
    "a gate voltage , @xmath2 , controls the position of the quantized levels relative to the chemical potentials of the leads and thereby the total number of electrons on the dot .",
    "the charging energy @xmath3 for adding electrons to the dot from the surrounding electron reservoirs ( leads ) is typically the largest energy scale , and the dot is strongly correlated provided @xmath4 .",
    "typical values for @xmath3 and @xmath1 for the dots in @xcite are @xmath5 mev and @xmath6 mev , so these dots are strongly correlated .    for temperatures @xmath7 quantum fluctuations",
    "are small , and transport is dominated by charging effects .",
    "this regime is well understood @xcite .",
    "the conductance , @xmath8 , exhibits a series of approximately equidistant peaks as a function of @xmath2 , with spacing @xmath3 .",
    "the peaks correspond to a fractional number of electrons on the dot and alternate `` coulomb blockade '' valleys to either an even or an odd number of electrons .    in this paper",
    "we shall be interested in the regime @xmath9 , where the strong quantum fluctuations can lead to a dramatic modification of the above picture of coulomb blockade .",
    "in particular , for an odd number of electrons on the dot , the quantum dot can have a net spin @xmath10 , and a kondo effect can develop .",
    "it has been predicted @xcite , that , at low temperature , this enhances the conductance in the odd electron valleys , turning them instead into plateaus of near perfect transmission .",

    "the results @xcite for the conductance are described in sec .",
    "[ zero - field]-[scaling ] and these are used to compare with experiment over a range of gate voltages and temperatures in sec .  [ comparison ] .",
    "experimental investigation of the regime @xmath11 has only recently become possible as a result of better control of the electrode geometry , allowing parameters like @xmath1 to be tuned to values of @xmath12-@xmath13k so that @xmath14 is accessible @xcite .",

    "is of great current interest @xcite .",
    "the results presented in sec .",
    "[ magnetic - field - effects ] should prove useful for interpreting magnetotransport experiments on strongly interacting quantum dots .",
    "at sufficiently low temperature , transport through a strongly interacting quantum dot will be mainly determined by the partially occupied level of the dot , denoted @xmath15 , which lies closest to the chemical potential of the leads .",
    "its occupancy , @xmath16 , can be varied from @xmath17 to @xmath18 by varying the gate voltage @xmath2 , where @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting model of a single correlated level @xmath20 with coulomb repulsion @xmath3 , coupled to left and right free electron reservoirs can be written as @xmath21 we assume energy independent lead couplings @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the fermi level density of states ( per spin ) of the left / right electron reservoir .",
    "the first two terms in @xmath24 represent the quantum dot , the third term is a magnetic field coupling only to the dot s spin @xmath25 ( we set @xmath26 ) , the fourth term represents the free electron reservoirs and the last term is the coupling between the dot and the reservoirs .",
    "this model can be reduced to the standard anderson impurity model of a single reservoir attached to the dot with strength @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the hybridization strength as usually defined in the anderson model @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath1 throughout . in experiments",
    "@xcite , @xmath1 is extracted by analyzing the high temperature ( @xmath30 ) behaviour of the conductance peaks ( see figure :  [ figure2]a below ) .    we assume , from here on , symmetric coupling to the leads , @xmath31 .",
    "the linear magnetoconductance , @xmath32 , is written as a sum of spin - resolved magnetoconductances , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 @xmath35 is the equilibrium spectral density and is expressed in terms of the local level green function , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the correlation part of the self - energy , by @xmath38",

    "is described in @xcite . here",
    ", we make a few remarks concerning the above refinements .",
    "the first refinement @xcite uses the correlation part of the self - energy , @xmath37 , to evaluate the spectral density @xmath39 in the anderson impurity model @xcite .",
    "this improves the spectra around the single - particle excitations @xmath15 and @xmath40 since the single particle broadening @xmath41 is put into the green function , @xmath42 , exactly , thereby making the excitations at @xmath15 and @xmath40 slightly sharper than in the earlier procedure @xcite which evaluated @xmath39 directly from its spectral representation .",
    "the description of the low energy kondo resonance is equally accurate within both approaches and close to exact@xcite .",
    "the second refinement uses the reduced density matrix in the nrg procedure for dynamical quantities @xcite in place of the grand canonical density matrix of the usual procedure @xcite .",
    "this reduces finite - size effects in the spectra .",
    "the latter are usually small on all energy scales in the case of zero magnetic field , but can be large in the case of a finite magnetic field , particularly for the high energy parts of the spectra ( since these are calculated from the shortest chains and are therefore subject to the largest finite - size effects ) .",
