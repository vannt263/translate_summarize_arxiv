    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) in its many versions is one of the most important models of mathematical physics , with applications to different fields @xcite as for example in semiconductor electronics @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , photonics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , fundamentation of quantum mechanics @xcite , dynamics of accelerators @xcite , mean - field theory of bose - einstein condensates @xcite or biomolecule dynamics @xcite to cite only a few examples . in some of these fields and many others",
    ", the nlse appears as an asymptotic limit for a slowly varying dispersive wave envelope propagating in a nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "moreover , the range of applicability is large because of the well - known universality of this equation @xcite .",
    "the study of these equations has served as a catalyzer of the development of new ideas or even mathematical concepts such as solitons @xcite or singularities in partial differential equations @xcite .    in the last years",
    "there has been an increased interest in a one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation with inhomogeneous nonlinearity ( inlse ) : @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 is an external potential and @xmath3 describes the spatial modulation of the nonlinearity .",
    "this equation arises in different physical contexts such as nonlinear optics and dynamics of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "but it is in the later field where the possibility of using the feschbach resonance management techniques to modify spatially the collisional interactions between atoms @xcite the one which has motivated a lot of theoretical research in the last few years focusing on questions of direct applicability to experiments .",
    "different aspects of the dynamics of solitons in these contexts have been studied such as the emission of solitons @xcite and the propagation of solitons when the space modulation of the nonlinearity is a random @xcite , periodic @xcite , linear @xcite or localized function @xcite .",
    "although many exact solutions of the nlse with spatially homogeneous nonlinearities and without potentials ( @xmath4 ) have been known for a long time , the problem of finding exact solutions even of the nls with homogeneous nonlinearities and general potentials is a very difficult one .    in this paper , using lie symmetries we find general classes of potentials @xmath2 and nonlinearity functions @xmath3 for which exact solutions can be constructed by combining solutions of the integrable nls and solvable potentials @xmath2 .",
    "the basic idea of the lie symmetries method is to study the invariance properties of given differential equations under continuous groups of transformations .",
    "this method has been applied successfully to different equations , such as , for example , differential equations that model anharmonic oscillators @xcite and madelung fluid equations @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have presented some examples of this methodology of specific physical interest .",
    "here we complement that analysis by presenting the general theory , provide more examples , study the case of asymmetric solutions and use qualitative theory of dynamical systems to provide a much more complete analysis of the method and its applications to equations of physical relevance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the general theory of the lie symmetry analysis for ordinary differential equations and particularize it for our model problem : the nonlinear schrdinger equation with an inhomogeneous nonlinearity . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the canonical transformations of the inlse . in section 4 ,",
    "we present the connection between the nlse and the inlse . in section 5 ,",
    "we use the method to construct explicit solutions of the stationary nonlinear schrdinger equation with an inhomogeneous nonlinearity and study the qualitative behaviour of the nlse and its qualitative connection with the inlse in different examples . finally , in section 6 , we present asymmetric solutions of the inlse . to our knowledge",
