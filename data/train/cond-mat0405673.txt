    "under suitable conditions systems of statistical mechanics can exhibit coexistence of different phases which are separated spatially by interfaces . structure and properties of such interfaces",
    "have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically , and still offer problems for current research .",
    "near critical points several interfacial properties are expected to show universal behaviour .",
    "since the 19th century , there has been continuous interest in the theoretical description of interfaces @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the interface has been described by mean field theories and their refinements @xcite as an `` intrinsic '' continuous profile with a width proportional to the bulk correlation length .",
    "the existence of the interface , however , breaks the translational invariance of the system , resulting in long - wavelength capillary wave fluctuations of the interface position as goldstone - modes .",
    "these fluctuations are neglected by mean field theory which assumes a flat interface , but they strongly influence the interfacial properties . according to capillary wave theory @xcite , the interface width , for example , depends logarithmically on the system size and diverges in the limit of an infinite system .",
    "mean field and capillary wave theory can be viewed as a small - scale and large - scale description of the interface , respectively , and then be combined in the `` convolution approximation '' @xcite . in this picture",
    "the interface is described as an intrinsic profile which is centered around a two - dimensional surface subject to capillary wave fluctuations .",
    "while capillary wave behaviour has been observed in many systems ( e.g.experimentally on liquid - vapor interfaces @xcite and polymer mixtures @xcite , in simulations of polymer mixtures @xcite and of the ising model @xcite ) , the mean field behaviour is difficult to access as the intrinsic profile - if it has a well - defined meaning at all - is broadened by the capillary wave fluctuations .",
    "the concept of intrinsic versus large - scale interface structure has so far not been defined unambiguously outside a given theory .",
    "there is no clear `` snapshot '' definition of an interface , which always shows overhangs , islands , clusters which may be as well assigned to the phase - separating interface region as to the fluctuation structure of the neighbouring homogeneous phases .    in this paper",
    "the attempt is made to separate the intrinsic structure from the influence of the capillary waves via a blocking procedure reminiscent of the kadanoff block spin method of renormalization group theory .",
    "the system of size @xmath0 with an interface perpendicular to the @xmath1-direction is divided into blocks of size @xmath2 .",
    "the different length scales are separated by using the block size @xmath3 as a variable cutoff . to calculate the interface position of the strongly fluctuating interface profiles on small length scales ,",
    "we implement a method which respects translational invariance ( in contrast to various other approaches in the literature ) . in this way , the local interface position , the interface profile and the interface width can be studied on the different length scales , thereby allowing a direct test of the convolution approximation and of the limits of validity of the capillary wave theory and of the mean field theory .",
    "it is found that on large length scales , the capillary wave picture is consistent with the data .    on small length scales , however , contrary to expectations we can not identify an intrinsic interface profile with a width of the order of the correlation length . for the case of the ising model under study the concept of the intrinsic profile is thus called into question .    an approach based on blocking has already been used by weeks @xcite for liquid - vapour interfaces in order to derive the capillary wave model from a microscopic model hamiltonian , thereby reconciling mean field and capillary wave theory as small - scale and large - scale interface descriptions , respectively . in the context of monte carlo simulations a procedure similar to the one",
    "used in this paper has been applied by werner et al .",
    "@xcite to homopolymer interfaces , finding consistency of their data with the convolution approximation .",
    "interfaces can be described in mean field theory by a continuous profile @xmath4 representing the difference between the concentrations of the two coexisting phases . in the framework of landau theory and its field theoretical extensions the profile function plays the role of a local order parameter . near the critical temperature",
    "the free energy density is written as @xcite : @xmath5 with the double - well potential @xmath6 the minima of this potential correspond to the two homogeneous phases , whose densities have been normalized to @xmath7 for simplicity .",
    "minimization of the free energy density ( [ landaufreeenergydensity ] ) with boundary conditions appropriate for an interface perpendicular to the @xmath8-axis leads to the typical hyperbolic tangent mean field profile @xcite @xmath9 with a width proportional to the mean field correlation length @xmath10 , which diverges near the critical point with exponent 1/2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 specifies the location of the interface which is arbitrary due to translational invariance .",
    "corrections due to fluctuations of the order parameter field can be calculated systematically in renormalized perturbation theory . in the `` local potential approximation ''",
    "only corrections to the local potential @xmath12 are taken into account , whereas contributions involving higher powers of derivatives are neglected .",
    "the resulting interface profile is of the form @xmath13 , where the width is now proportional to the physical correlation length @xmath14 , which diverges near the critical point with exponent @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to the scaling form proposed by fisk and widom @xcite .",
    "to lowest order the profile function @xmath16 is equal to the mean field profile function , @xmath17 . in higher orders , corrections to the potential @xmath12 due to perturbative loop contributions",
    "modify the mean field profile @xcite .",
    "we do , however , not consider them as they are numerically small and can be neglected in our context .",
    "the interface profile @xmath18 in lowest order of the local potential approximation is to be distinguished from the mean field profile .",
    "it represents a refinement of landau theory that is consistent with scaling @xcite and holds near the critical point .    in the local potential approximation",
    "long wavelength fluctuations are not fully taken into account .",
    "consequently the profile ( [ intrinsicprofile ] ) does not contain the effects of capillary waves , which are discussed in the following section .",
    "the function above thus represents an intrinsic interface profile .",
    "translational invariance is broken by the presence of the interface .",
    "the goldstone bosons associated with this broken symmetry are long wavelength excitations of the interface position , which have vanishing energy cost in the infinite wavelength limit @xcite .",
    "these capillary waves strongly influence interfacial properties like the interface width but are neglected by mean field theory which assumes a flat interface . in capillary wave theory , as introduced by buff et al .",
    "@xcite , bubbles , overhangs and any continuous density variations of the interface are neglected .",
    "the local interface position is parameterized by a single - valued function @xmath19 , describing the interface as a fluctuating membrane .",
    "the free energy cost of capillary waves is basically due to the increase in interface area against the reduced interface tension @xmath20 .",
    "thus the capillary wave free energy ( multiplied by the inverse temperature @xmath21 ) is @xcite @xmath22       \\approx \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\int\\!\\!dx dy\\,(\\nabla h)^2\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , i.e.  long wavelength and small amplitude , has been assumed .",
    "the gaussian nature of the capillary wave model allows analytic calculation of thermal averages .",
    "the local interface position is distributed according to a gaussian distribution @xmath24 with variance @xmath25 in order to avoid divergence of the integral , a lower cutoff @xmath26 and an upper cutoff @xmath27 have been introduced . here",
    "@xmath28 is the system size , which determines the maximal allowed wavelength and provides a natural lower cutoff for the capillary wave spectrum .",
    "the cutoff length @xmath29 , which is so far arbitrary , sets the scale below which capillary wave theory ceases to be valid . as there should be no capillary waves with wavelength smaller than the intrinsic width of the interface , @xmath29 should be of the order of the correlation length .",
    "the factor @xmath30 in the lower cutoff is due to periodic boundary conditions and has also been introduced in the upper cutoff for convenience .",
    "the phenomenological capillary wave model thus requires two inputs : the macroscopic interface tension @xmath20 and the cutoff @xmath29 .",
    "while the interface tension near the critical temperature is known from scaling @xcite , the cutoff @xmath29 is unknown .    in the capillary wave picture",
    "the instantaneous interface profile is a sharp step function between the two phases .",
    "nevertheless , in the thermal average the capillary wave fluctuations produce a continuous density profile @xmath31 with a finite width whose square is proportional to the variance @xmath32 ( [ variance ] ) and thus to the logarithm of the system size @xmath28 . in other words ,",
    "the apparent width of the interface depends on the length scale on which the interface is studied and diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the two different descriptions of the interface profile - intrinsic profile and capillary wave theory - can be reconciled by adopting the view that the intrinsic profile describes the interface on a microscopic scale of the order of the correlation length , while capillary wave theory describes the macroscopic interface fluctuations of wavelengths much larger than the correlation length . neglecting the coupling of the capillary wave fluctuations to the intrinsic interfacial structure , the interface can be viewed as a fluctuating capillary wave theory membrane @xmath19 , to which an intrinsic profile @xmath33 is `` attached '' . in this way",
    "an instantaneous profile @xmath34 is obtained . performing the thermal average over the capillary waves ,",
    "the `` apparent '' profile is given by the convolution @xmath35 in this convolution approximation , the intrinsic profile @xmath36 is thus broadened by capillary wave fluctuations .",
    "the broadening increases with the system size according to eqs .",
    "( [ gaussiandistribution ] ) and ( [ variance ] ) corresponding to the fact that in a larger system more capillary waves are allowed .",
    "the interface width can not be defined in a unique way , and various definitions have been used in the literature ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . for numerical purposes , a suitable definition of the squared interface width is the second moment of a weight function which is proportional to the gradient of the interface profile m : @xmath37 due to the linearity of this definition and of the convolution approximation ( [ convolutionprofile ] ) , the squared width @xmath38 of the convolution profile @xmath39 is simply the sum of the intrinsic width squared @xmath40 of the intrinsic profile @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ intrinsicprofile ] ) , and of the capillary width squared @xmath41 of the capillary wave profile @xmath42 , eq .",
    "( [ capillaryprofile ] ) : @xmath43 this expression shows the broadening of the intrinsic profiles by capillary waves .",
    "it can be cast into a temperature - independent form by expressing all lengths in units of twice the correlation length : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 . here",
    "the slope @xmath47 contains the the universal constant @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we also considered other definitions of the interface width , e.g.  with a weight function proportional to @xmath49 , but the results to be discussed below are not altered significantly .",
    "in experiments or monte carlo simulations of systems with interfaces the observed interface profile and width are the total ones , including the effects of the intrinsic structure as well as of the capillary waves . in order to investigate the question whether the intrinsic structure can be separated from the effects of capillary waves , suitable observables have to be constructed .",
    "we have studied this question by means of monte carlo simulations of the three - dimensional ising model , which is in the same universality class as three - dimensional binary mixtures .",
    "the results allow to test the predictions from capillary wave theory and the validity of the convolution approximation .    in the simulations",
    "a cubic lattice of size @xmath0 is used , with spins @xmath50 on each lattice site @xmath51 .",
    "the presence of an interface is enforced by antiperiodic boundary - conditions in the @xmath8-direction , while the boundary conditions in the @xmath52-directions are periodic .",

    "length scales a blocking procedure is applied .",
    "the system is split into columns of block size @xmath61 and of length @xmath1 .",
    "the block size @xmath3 will later be varied to allow for systematic analysis . in each block",
    "@xmath62 a local block profile is calculated by averaging over the lateral coordinates in the block : @xmath63      due to strong thermal fluctuations near the critical point the interface position for this profile is not well - defined .",
    "various methods have been proposed to determine the interface position ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and applied to total interface profiles , i.e.  for the profile ( [ blockprofile ] ) at @xmath64 .",
    "these methods , however , are not appropriate for our purpose , because they either neglect bulk fluctuations , whose contributions we want to take into account fully , or they suffer from a lack of translational invariance : if the interface is , due to interface wandering , not in the middle of the system , the fluctuations above and below the interface do not average out , leading to a biased value for the interface position . this bias can be neglected for profiles on sufficiently large length scales , i.e.  for block profiles with sufficiently large @xmath3 , but not for the strongly fluctuating profiles on smaller length scales @xmath3 .    to solve this problem , a translationally invariant method to determine the interface position",
    "is proposed @xcite .",
    "because of the periodic / antiperiodic boundary conditions , the ising lattice is wrapped to a torus .",
    "the antiperiodicity is implemented by taking the couplings between nearest neighbours @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be negative for a particular value of @xmath67 . superficially , the choice of @xmath68 appears to break translation invariance along the @xmath8-direction .",
    "this is , however , not the case . under a shift of @xmath68",
    "the hamiltonian remains invariant , if at the same time those spins , which cross the plane of antiperiodicity , are flipped .",
    "consequently translation invariance remains a symmetry .",
    "observables should be constructed in such a way that they also respect translation invariance .",
    "translational invariance of our method to determine the interface position is achieved in the following way .",
    "the antiperiodicity point @xmath68 is shifted through the system successively .",
    "the values of the block profiles @xmath69 , which cross the antiperiodicity plane @xmath67 , change signs appropriately . for a monotone interface profile function @xmath70",
    ", all values would get the same sign , if @xmath68 coincides with the center of the interface .",
    "correspondingly , we define the location @xmath8 of the interface to be that value of @xmath68 , which makes the number of values of @xmath69 having the same sign maximal , i.e.  being mostly positive or mostly negative .",
    "mathematically this point can be determined as the maximum of @xmath71 . in this way",
    ", one assures that the fluctuations near the interface determine the precise location of the interface position .",
    "it would also be possible to use the minimum of @xmath72 , which is attained when the interface is located opposite of @xmath68 . in this case , however , fluctuations deep in the bulk phase opposite ( on the torus ) to the interface position would account for the precise location of the interface position , which is physically less meaningful .",
    "this boundary shift method very successfully determines the interface positions for strongly fluctuating profiles even on rather small length scales @xmath3 , but of course fails for extremely small length scales @xmath73 , where the profiles @xmath69 are still reminiscent of their ising nature with only two allowed values @xmath7 and thus do not possess a well - defined interface position at all .",
    "this will result in ising lattice artefacts for extremely small block sizes in the later discussion .",
    "but as neither of the interface models discussed in section [ theory ] applies on a microscopic scale , this deficiency of the method does not prevent a test of the models .      in order to obtain the interface profile without fluctuations on length scales larger than @xmath3 , the block profiles",
    "@xmath69 can now be shifted such that the interface position is in the middle of the system .",
    "note that values that pass the antiperiodic boundary conditions change sign ( spin flip ) . to assure that the profile values above the interface are predominantly positive , an overall sign change is applied if necessary .",
    "the shift procedure corresponds to a measurement in a moving frame that is wandering with the local interface , i.e.  to an elimination of the zero mode within the block .",
    "one can now take the block and monte carlo average over the block profiles @xmath69 to obtain the local interface profile @xmath70 on the scale of the block length @xmath3 .",
    "this profile corresponds to the apparent profile ( [ convolutionprofile ] ) of the convolution approximation measured on a length scale of the block size @xmath3 .",
    "the interface width of the profile is determined via a discretized gradient analysis corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ gradientwidth ] ) .",
    "let the @xmath8-coordinates take the values @xmath74 .",
    "an auxiliary coordinate @xmath75 is introduced which labels the positions between adjacent lattice sites and is centered about the middle of the system , assuming the values @xmath76 .",
    "a normalized gradient is then defined by @xmath77 with the normalization @xmath78 the interface width is the second moment of this weight function : @xmath79    so far each block has been considered as an ising system of size @xmath2 in its own right , for which the same measurements as for a total ising system have been made . in this way all fluctuations of wavelengths _ larger _ than @xmath3 have been cut off .",
    "the opposite approach is to first average over each block and then consider the resulting ising system of size @xmath80 , thereby `` averaging out '' all fluctuations of wavelength _ smaller _ than @xmath3 .",

    "<S> a blocking procedure is applied , using the block size as a variable cutoff , and a translationally invariant method to determine the interface position of strongly fluctuating profiles on small length scales is introduced . while the capillary wave picture is confirmed on large length scales and its limit of validity is estimated , an intrinsic regime is , contrary to expectations , not observed . </S>",
