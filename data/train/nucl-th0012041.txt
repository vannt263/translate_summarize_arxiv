    "photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons off nuclei has attracted essential interest during the last decades , experimentally and theoretically as well .",
    "theoretical analysis of @xmath2-reactions on nuclei is hampered by the three major problems : the unknown off - shell behavior of the two - body @xmath3 amplitude , inaccuracies in the description of the nuclear target as a many - body system , and rescattering effects in the final state .",
    "the simplest reaction is , of course , the process of coherent @xmath0 photoproduction on deuteron .",
    "there are many theoretical studies devoted to ( @xmath4 ) reactions on deuteron .",
    "early attempts to go beyond a simple impulse approximation led to very different conclusions  @xcite  @xcite as do more recent approaches based on the effective two - body formulations  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the experimental cross - section  @xcite of the reaction @xmath5 in the near - threshold region is far above these theoretical predictions .",
    "therefore , a reliable description of @xmath0 photoproduction on deuteron is needed .",
    "to consider reaction  ( [ equn ] ) , we employ the exact alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) formalism modified to include the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the advantage of working with coupled equations involving the elastic and rearrangement operators of the final state , is not only suggested by questions of uniqueness , but also by the relevance of rescattering effects which were found to give a significant contribution to the corresponding amplitude  @xcite . in the operator form ,",
    "the ags equations for the @xmath6 system read @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the green s operator of the three particles involved , operator @xmath9 is a two  body operator embedded in the three ",
    "body space ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and operators @xmath12 describe elastic scattering and rearrangement processes ( for more details see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a photon can be introduced into this formalism by considering the @xmath1 and @xmath13 states as two different channels of the same system .",
    "this means that we should replace the t - operator @xmath14 by a @xmath15 matrix .",
    "it is clear , that such replacements of the kernels of integral equations  ( [ syst ] ) lead to the corresponding solutions having a similar matrix form @xmath16 here @xmath17 describes the compton scattering , @xmath18 the photoproduction process , and @xmath19 the elastic @xmath1 scattering .",
    "it is technically more convenient to consider the reaction of @xmath0-photoabsorption , which is inverse to reaction  ( [ equn ] ) .",
    "then the photoproduction cross - section can be obtained by applying the detailed balance principle .",
    "therefore , we need the amplitude @xmath20 which in the first order of electromagnetic interaction can be written in the form @xmath21 it should be emphasized that via the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 in  ( [ solve ] ) all the rescattering effects are properly taken into account .",
    "the corresponding transition amplitudes obey the system  ( [ syst ] ) which is reduced further to two coupled equations because of identity of the nucleons ( see ref .",
    "it is customary to reduce the dimension of these equations by representing the two - body t - operators in separable form .",
    "the s - wave nucleon - nucleon separable potential is adopted from ref .",
    "@xcite with its parameters slightly modified to be consistent with more recent nn data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the @xmath0-nucleon t - matrix",
    "is taken in the form @xmath24 the range parameter @xmath25 @xmath26 was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the parameters of the @xmath29 resonance  @xcite .",
    "the strength parameter @xmath30 is chosen to reproduce the @xmath0-nucleon complex scattering length @xmath31 .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is not accurately known , different analysis provided for it values in the range @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "recently , however , most of the authors agreed that @xmath34 is around @xmath35 fm .",
    "to construct a separable t - matrix of the reaction @xmath36 , we used the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath18 ( which is equal to @xmath37 ) was obtained as an element of a multi - channel t - matrix on the energy shell . for our calculations , we extended this t - matrix off the energy shell , using the yamaguchi form - factors which become unit on the energy shell .",
    "it is generally believed , that @xmath37 is different for neutron and proton .",
    "we assumed that they have the same functional form and differ by a constant factor @xmath38 a multipole analysis gives for this factor the following estimate  @xcite : @xmath39",
    "as was expected , our calculations revealed a very strong final state interaction in the reaction  ( [ equn ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the corresponding cross - sections obtained by solving the ags equations and by using the impulse approximation ( ia ) is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the ia - results are multiplied by 10 . besides the fact that the ia - curve is generally an order of magnitude lower , it does not show a resonant enhancement which is clearly seen when all the rescattering and re - arrangement processes are taken into account . in this connection",
    ", it should be noted that experimental data  @xcite for the reaction  ( [ equn ] ) , given in figs .  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] show a pronounced enhancement of the differential cross - section at low energies .        in order to examine the dependence of our calculations on the choice of the parameters of the t - matrices @xmath19 and @xmath41 , we did variations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 within the corresponding uncertainty intervals .",
    "one of the most important parameters of the theory is the ratio of the photoproduction amplitudes for neutron and proton ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "six curves corresponding to different choices of @xmath40 are depicted in fig .",
    "these curves were calculated with @xmath44 fm .",
    "the experimental data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we present the result of our calculations for five different choices of @xmath43 , namely , 0.55 fm , 0.65 fm , 0.725 fm , 0.75 fm , and 0.85 fm .",
    "this sequence of @xmath43 corresponds to the upward sequence of the curves in the near - threshold region .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 was taken to be @xmath45 .        a comparison of the curves depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] with the corresponding experimental data shows that no agreement with the data can be reached unless the ratio @xmath40 is greater than @xmath46 .    under all variations of the parameters",
    ", however , the resonant peak remains about 15 mev to the left of the experimental peak .",
    "since this peak is due to the resonant final state interaction between the @xmath0 meson and deuteron , we may expect that it can be shifted to the right by introducing a repulsion into the @xmath1 interaction . to introduce an @xmath1 repulsion which preserves the separable form of the corresponding t - matrix",
    ", we used the method suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite where a separable nucleon - nucleon t - matrix includes an energy dependent factor , @xmath47 this factor causes the nn phase - shift to change sign at the energy @xmath48 @xmath26 , which is equivalent to presence of an nn repulsion .",
    "since the purpose of our numerical experiment was to check if an @xmath1 repulsion could shift the peak to the right and there is no information about such repulsion , we used the same function @xmath49 and did variations of @xmath50 , namely @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath50 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where the larger @xmath50 the lower is the curve .",
    "parameters used here are : @xmath44 fm and @xmath55 ."
