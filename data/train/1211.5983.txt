    "we first recall a natural and as yet unsolved problem from @xcite , that arose in the context of the geometry of numbers :    [ motivation ] does there exist a strictly convex bounded curve @xmath1 in the plane such that , as @xmath2 tends to infinity , @xmath8    the problem we address here is a probabilistic analogue of problem , for which we first give some motivation and definitions .",
    "we recall from @xcite the following results , giving lower bounds for rational points on any strictly convex curve @xmath1 in the plane :    @xmath9    the latter lower bound means that in the case of a positive answer to problem [ motivation ] , the number of points of @xmath10 on @xmath1 can not converge to infinity faster than @xmath11 .",
    "we also recall that in higher dimensions there is no gap in such asymptotic estimates .",
    "namely , it is proved in @xcite that for a bounded , closed , and strictly convex surface @xmath12 in @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , we have @xmath15    as added motivation , we note that there are probabilistic models of rigid arithmetical objects , like the integers or the primes , which capture many quantitative characteristics of the original rigid structure .",
    "these probabilistic analogues are often easier to handle and offer support for the validity of their corresponding `` rigid '' statements .",
    "for instance , the riemann hypothesis may be considered as a statement that the mbius @xmath16-function displays some quasi - random behavior .",
    "specifically , the following asymptotic for the partial sums of the mbius function @xmath17 is known to be equivalent to rh : @xmath18 for any @xmath19 .",
    "however , if we replace the deterministic sequence @xmath20 by independent identically distributed bounded variables with zero mean , then such an estimate holds with probability @xmath6 , by standard methods . because there is no evidence that the values of the mbius function are highly dependent , this asymptotic is considered as heuristic support for the riemann hypothesis .    here",
    "we deal with another arithmetical object , the integer lattice @xmath21 in @xmath5-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we consider its natural probabilistic analogue : a random configuration of points given by a poisson process with intensity @xmath6 in @xmath13 .    as a non - example for problem ,",
    "consider the unit circle @xmath22 , centered at the origin .",
    "then @xmath23 tends to infinity . in other words , on average the unit circle has many rational points .",
    "however , for any prime @xmath2 the unit circle has only at most 12 rational points with denominator @xmath2 , and hence the circle does not satisfy property .",
    "moreover , if we consider any real algebraic curve @xmath1 in the plane , of genus @xmath24 , we know by faltings theorem that it contains only finitely many rational points . hence all such curves @xmath1 do not satisfy .",
    "though we do not know of any formal argument that allows us to resolve problem [ motivation ] , these counterexamples suggest a negative answer to this problem .    on the other hand ,",
    "`` most '' convex curves are not algebraic , and if we pick a convex curve @xmath1 `` at random '' , it is natural to ask if @xmath1 might still satisfy property ?    in sharp contrast with algebraic curves , it turns out that if we work in the probabilistic framework suggested above , then we find here an affirmative answer to a very natural probabilistic analogue of problem [ motivation ] .    to describe the main result , we first order all of the prime powers in ascending order , as follows : @xmath25 , and so on . for technical reasons that are explicated in the preliminaries section [ preliminaries ] below ,",
    "we define @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a power of the prime @xmath28",
    ". the value @xmath29 will be the intensity of our poisson process .",
    "we define our randomized analogue of a lattice to be a poisson point set @xmath30 , with intensity equal to @xmath29 , for each @xmath27 which is a power of a prime .",
    "in other words , the randomized point set @xmath30 by definition satisfies a spatial poisson process distribution .",
    "it will turn out that the only property we really require in our analysis is that the intensity @xmath31 . in section [ preliminaries ] ,",
    "we define a more general poisson analogue of a lattice , called @xmath4 for any integer @xmath5 , but we show that due to the elementary combinatorial structure of @xmath4 , it is sufficient to work with the particular analogue @xmath30 defined here .",
    "[ tm : main ] with probability @xmath6 there exists a strictly convex , bounded curve @xmath1 such that @xmath32 as @xmath33 tends to @xmath34 .",
    "many geometric questions regarding lattices appear to have similar answers to their corresponding poisson framework questions , in the context of a ` perturbed lattice ' . here",
    "are some more examples .",
    "let @xmath35 be a convex and compact set in the plane .",
    "we consider all possible convex polygons with vertices in @xmath36 for some large @xmath2 .",
    "we may now ask some natural and intuitive questions :    [ one ] how many such polygons are there in total ?    [ two ] how many vertices does such a polygon have ?    [ three ] what does a typical polygon look like ?",
    "the same questions may be asked for a random set of points instead of points chosen from a lattice .",
    "for example , we may consider @xmath37 independetly and uniformly distributed points in @xmath35 , for some constant @xmath38 , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "we may also consider a poisson process inside @xmath35 , with intensity @xmath39 .",
    "the answers to above questions , , and appear to be very similar in the lattice setting and in the probabilistic setting ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . amazingly , only the specific values of constants differ . however , the methods of the geometry and numbers ( lattice setting ) and of stochastic geometry ( randomization ) do indeed differ . in this paper",
    "we work with a randomized model for the set of rational points @xmath40 .",
    "first , we use the poisson process of intensity @xmath6 in @xmath41 , which we call @xmath42 , as our most natural realization for a randomized relaxation of the integer lattice @xmath43 . in general , we denote by @xmath44 a poisson process of intensity @xmath2 .",
    "we recall the definition of this spacial process . for more information ,",
    "see , e.g. @xcite    [ def : poisson ] a poisson process of intensity @xmath45 is characterized by the following two properties :    * for any region @xmath46 with area @xmath47 , the number of events in @xmath46 obeys a @xmath6-dimensional poisson distribution with mean @xmath48 . *",
    "the number of events in any finite collection of non - overlapping regions are independent of each other .    in order to extend poisson process to the rational set @xmath40 one might first represent the original lattice by the union @xmath49 and then define the randomized rational lattice as @xmath50 .",
    "unfortunately , in this case the probabilistic object does not enjoy the set - theoretical property of the original lattice , namely that @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "for this reason we introduce a slightly different randomization process .",
    "we begin with a disjoint decomposition of @xmath40 given as follows .",
    "@xmath53    we notice that each set @xmath54 can be expressed by inclusion - exclusion principle as a sum ( with signs ) of scaled integer lattices . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath55 are all prime divisors of @xmath2 , then @xmath56 thus in the randomization process it is natural to assume that points in each @xmath54 are distributed uniformly in the plane with the following density per unit area @xmath57    we notice that @xmath58 .",
    "we define @xmath59 as a random poisson configuration of intensity @xmath60 .",
    "then the random analogue of @xmath40 is @xmath61 ( processes with different @xmath2 are mutually independent ) .",
    "we observe a few useful properties of such a process .",
    "* @xmath62 coincide with the usual poisson process of intensity @xmath39 , which is the standard randomized analog for the rational lattice @xmath63 with fixed denominator @xmath2 .",
    "* @xmath64 and similarly for lattices @xmath65 . in this sense ,",
    "the family of @xmath62 obeys the same set theoretical structure as the rational lattices .",
    "* @xmath66 is also a poisson process of certain intensity ; its expected number of points coincides with the number of rational points with denominators not exceeding @xmath2 in any unit square of general position , i.e. @xmath66 is a natural analog of @xmath67 .",
    "the proof uses the notion of a _ generalized affine length of a convex chain _ introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath68 denote the doubled area of a polygon @xmath69 , @xmath70 denote the pseudo - scalar product of vectors @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( i.e. an oriented area of a parallelogram , based on these vectors ) .",
    "fix a triangle @xmath73 oriented so that @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be a strictly convex chain .",
    "we call it @xmath76-chain , if all its vertices lie inside triangle @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath76-chain @xmath77 be inscribed in an @xmath76-chain @xmath78 ( i.e. points @xmath79 lie on respective segments @xmath80 ) .",
    "define a _ generalized affine length _ of a chain @xmath1 with respect to @xmath81 as @xmath82    part ( i ) of the following lemma is well - known , and part ( ii ) is a non - surprising quantitative improvement of ( i ) .",

    "we denote @xmath96 and @xmath97 our goal is to show that    a.   @xmath98 , and b.   set of points @xmath86 , for which @xmath99 , has area at least @xmath100 .    by simple geometrical observations",
    ",    @xmath101    later is the sum of two expressions of the form @xmath102 .",
    "hence the proof of ( i ) is finished by applying am - gm inequality .",
    "for the proof of ( ii ) we want first to estimate both of the aforementioned expressions in from above . we will do it in a particular case when all ratios involved in lie between @xmath103 and @xmath6 and differ pairwise by at most @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a parameter , value for which we will assign later .",
    "we note that for any non - negative numbers @xmath106 the following identity holds : @xmath107    also , when @xmath108 lie between @xmath103 and @xmath6 and differ pairwise by at most @xmath104 , @xmath109 and we can use this to estimate right hand side of from above : @xmath110    now , fix @xmath111 .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath112 in other words , if all ratios in lie between @xmath103 and @xmath6 and differ pairwise by at most @xmath113 , then @xmath86 is @xmath114-admissible .",

    "<S> we solve a randomized version of the following open question : is there a strictly convex , bounded curve @xmath0 such that the number of rational points on @xmath1 , with denominator @xmath2 , approaches infinity with @xmath2 ? </S>",
    "<S> although this natural problem appears to be out of reach using current methods , we consider a probabilistic analogue using a spatial poisson - process that simulates the refined rational lattice @xmath3 , which we call @xmath4 , for each natural number @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the main result here is that with probability @xmath6 there exists a strictly convex , bounded curve @xmath1 such that @xmath7 as @xmath5 tends to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> the methods include the notion of a generalized affine length of a convex curve , defined in @xcite . </S>"
