    "dielectric mie resonators made of moderate refractive index materials , such as semi - conductor materials in the optical or near infra - red regime , can feature electric and magnetic modes of low order .",
    "these modes can be easily and efficiently excited either from near or far field illumination @xcite .",
    "this novel class of photonic resonators is very promising to design directive antennas @xcite , to enhance the electric or magnetic near field intensities @xcite , to design subwavelength sized light cavities @xcite , to host frequency mixing processes such as third harmonic generation @xcite , and even to create isotropically polarized speckle patterns @xcite .",
    "contrarily to spherical nano - metallic particles , dielectric mie resonators exhibit both electric and magnetic resonant modes @xcite . however , it is still unclear whether magnetic modes are a good platform to enhance light - matter interaction in silicon subwavelength - sized cavities . an interesting way to address",
    "this question is to study the purcell factor of these cavities .",
    "the purcell factor is a figure of merit widely used to characterize light - matter interaction in photonic cavities @xcite . in quantum electrodynamics , for example",
    ", it has been widely used to study rabi oscillations in the weak - coupling regime @xcite .",
    "the purcell factor quantifies the enhancement of the spontaneous decay rate of a dipolar emitter coupled with a cavity , and it is defined as @xcite : @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the frequency of the dipole ; @xmath2 the speed of light ; @xmath3 the quality factor of the electromagnetic mode of the cavity ( @xmath4 ) that the emitter is mainly coupled to ; @xmath5 the effective volume of the mode @xmath4 ; and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) the spontaneous decay rate of a dipolar emitter in the presence of an optical cavity ( vacuum ) .",
    "the design of photonic cavities at the nanoscale brought the attention of the nano - optics community to the purcell factor @xcite . nevertheless , the first attempts of using the purcell factor given by eq.([pf ] ) to compute the enhancement of spontaneous decay rates ( @xmath8 ) were not as accurate as expected .",
    "it was seen that the dyadic green tensor formulation @xcite used to compute @xmath8 did not yield the same results as the purcell factor given by eq.([pf ] ) . as noted by koenderink @xcite , the use of eq.([pf ] ) to compute spontaneous decay rates",
    "is based on a few restrictive assumptions , which are not usually fulfilled by photonic nano - cavities . hence , some changes needed to be done in the purcell factor formula so that @xmath9 .",
    "these changes can be summarized in two : extension of the purcell factor to a scenario where the dipolar emitter couples to a superposition of modes @xmath4 of the cavity ; and redefinition of the effective volume @xmath5 of each of the @xmath4 normal modes of the resonator .",
    "one of the first attempts to redefine the effective volume for spherical cavities was proposed by colas des francs _ et al . _ in 2012 @xcite .",
    "the proposed method used the equality between the classical normalized decay rates @xcite and the purcell factor given by eq.([pf ] ) .",
    "that is , the effective volume @xmath5 was computed by substitution : @xmath10 with this empirical formulation , an effective volume is obtained for each multipolar order of the spherical resonator . recently ,",
    "attention was focused on the definition of the effective volume with respect to the normal modes of arbitrary resonators @xcite .",
    "the normal modes of the system are solutions of maxwell equations in the absence of sources , with outgoing radiation conditions , and with a certain normalization @xcite . due to the outgoing radiation conditions , the hamiltonian of the system is non - hermitian and the normal modes of the system have complex eigenfrequencies @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "let us notice that a normalization condition of the kind @xmath12 can not be applied to normal modes with resonant complex frequencies @xmath11 because @xmath13 @xcite . in this work , we define the normal modes associated to the eigenfrequencies @xmath11 following the normalization condition given in @xcite : @xmath14 where all the magnitudes that depend on the frequency are particularized at @xmath15 .",
    "at this point , two comments are in order .",
    "firstly , the normalization condition given by eq.([nm ] ) can also be expressed as @xcite : @xmath16 { \\mathrm{d}}\\mathbf{r}\\ ] ] as sauvan _",
    "et al . _ showed in @xcite , this type of normalization is especially well - suited for numerical calculations .",
    "the underlying reason is that the volume integrals can be numerically evaluated using a perfectly - matched - layer technique .",
    "furthermore , their normalization condition is easily extended for dispersive and magnetic materials @xcite : @xmath17 { \\mathrm{d}}\\mathbf{r}\\ ] ] secondly , the basis of normal modes @xmath18 for leaky cavities with arbitrary geometries is not complete , in general @xcite .",
    "however , for spherical leaky cavities , it has been demonstrated that the multipolar fields are a complete basis to describe the problem @xcite .",
    "the recent advances on the modal analysis of purcell factors were performed with electric dipolar sources .",
    "the formulation has been presented in @xcite , where the enhancement of the decay rate was computed as : @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electric dipole moment of the emitter , and @xmath22 is a unitary vector . however , interest in magnetic spontaneous emission has been growing over the last years , in particular using trivalent lanthanide ions @xcite .",
    "this strong interest in coupling lanthanide ions to nano - cavities makes us emphasize the fact that both electric and magnetic emitters can give rise to an enhanced spontaneous decay rate . following the formalism shown in @xcite ,",
    "next we give the purcell factor formula for an emitting magnetic dipole .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for a dipolar magnetic interaction is @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the magnetic dipole moment of the emitter , and @xmath25 is a unitary vector . if @xmath26 is the magnetic dyadic green function @xcite , then the purcell factor can be computed as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 it is important to note that eqs.([fe ] ) and ( [ pfg ] ) can not be directly added .",
    "that is , the enhancement of decay rates of a dipolar emitter which is a linear combination of an electric and a magnetic dipole ( @xmath29 ) is computed with the following formula @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xcite , and @xmath32 is given in @xcite .",
    "using the currents produced by both dipoles , @xmath33 can be written as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be computed using the green tensor formalism @xcite .",
    "notice that when the emitter is a superposition of an electric and a magnetic dipole , @xmath37 since : @xmath38 with @xmath39 given by the equation above .",
    "here , thanks to the analytic formulation of mie theory , we analytically compute the normal modes of the system and their associated normal frequencies . in particular , for a mie resonator , due to the symmetries of the system @xcite , the normal modes of the system are the multipolar fields , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is directly related to the following differential operators @xcite : @xmath47 & = & j(j+1 ) { \\mathbf{e}_{j , m_z , q}^{(x)}}\\\\ j_z   \\left [ { \\mathbf{e}_{j , m_z , q}^{(x)}}\\right ] & = & m_z { \\mathbf{e}_{j , m_z , q}^{(x)}}\\\\ \\pi   \\left [ { \\mathbf{e}_{j , m_z , q}^{(x)}}\\right ] & = & \\left\\lbrace \\begin{array}{l } ( -)^j\\mathbf{e}_{j , m_z , q}^{(m ) } \\\\ ( -)^{j+1}\\mathbf{e}_{j , m_z , q}^{(e ) } \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] nonetheless , @xmath48 is different in this sense .",
    "given a fixed combination of @xmath49 , there exists a numerable infinite of @xmath48 values such that @xmath50 is a normal mode of maxwell equations with an associated eigenfrequency @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "these eigenfrequencies @xmath52 can be found by solving the following two transcendental equations : @xmath53 ' & \\ \\ = & h_j^{(1)}({x_{j , m_z , q}^{(e ) } } ) [ n_r { x_{j , m_z , q}^{(e)}}j_j(n_r { x_{j , m_z , q}^{(e ) } } ) ] ' & \\quad \\text{for } & ( x)=(e )   \\\\ j_j(n_r { x_{j , m_z , q}^{(m)}})[{x_{j , m_z , q}^{(m)}}h_j^{(1)}({x_{j , m_z , q}^{(m ) } } ) ] ' & \\ \\ = & h_j^{(1)}({x_{j , m_z , q}^{(m ) } } ) [ n_r { x_{j , m_z , q}^{(m)}}j_j(n_r { x_{j , m_z , q}^{(m ) } } ) ] ' & \\quad \\text{for } & ( x)=(m )   \\label{om}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 .    here , it is important to note a few facts .",
    "firstly , eqs.([oe]-[om ] ) do not depend on @xmath55 , therefore @xmath56 .",
    "secondly , in eqs.([oe]-[om ] ) , the dependence on @xmath57 is explicit on the spherical bessel functions of the different kinds , and the dependence on @xmath46 is apparent as the equations for electric and magnetic frequencies are different .",
    "however , the dependence on @xmath48 is not explicit .",
    "that is because , given a fixed @xmath58 , @xmath48 is an integer that numerates all the solutions to eqs.([oe]-[om ] ) in ascending order , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath59 .    due to the normalization condition imposed by eq.([nm ] ) , the normal modes of the system are @xcite : @xmath60 \\\\ \\mathbf{e}_{j , m_z , q}^{(e ) } ( r,\\theta,\\phi ) & = & \\dfrac{a_j^{(e)}}{\\epsilon(r)k_{j , q}^{(e)}r } \\left [ j(j+1 ) r_j(k_{j , q}^{(e ) } ) { y_{j , m_z}}{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}+ \\right .",

    "first of all , we re - write the purcell factor formula given by eq.([fe ] ) using the normal modes defined in eqs.([ejme]-[epsilon ] ) and the eigenfrequencies given by eqs.([oe]-[om ] ) : @xmath76 \\label{pfsph}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 that is , ten parameters need to be specified to compute the effective volume for a dipolar emitter using eq.([veffgen ] ) : @xmath78 .",
    "now , it is enlightening to compare eq.([pfsph ] ) with the classical decay rates of the same system , which can be found in @xcite : @xmath79\\ ] ] the multipolar coefficients",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 defined in @xcite modulate the dipolar field exactly in the same manner as the translation - addition coefficients @xmath82 do in eq.([dip_multi ] ) @xcite .",
    "they are defined as : @xmath83 hence , by comparison , we observe that the effective volumes can be analyzed thanks to the translation - addition coefficients : @xmath84 it is observed that the purcell factor dependence on the azimuthal number @xmath55 is fully captured by the effective volume . for instance , if @xmath85 . but the dependence on @xmath57 is more complex , and so is the dependence on @xmath1 , which is given by a summation of the kind @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the effective volume quantifies the coupling between the electromagnetic field created by the emitter and the normal mode in consideration , as well as their spectral overlap .",
    "for the rest of the study , we consider a silicon - made mie resonator with a refractive index @xmath87 , magnetic permability @xmath73 , of radius @xmath88 , embedded in air .",
    "the normal modes of the system and their eigenfrequencies are computed using the formulas given by eqs.([oe]-[epsilon ] ) .",
    "it will be shown that even in the more symmetric situations , the purcell factor has contributions from more than one normal mode .",
    "also , we will show that , thanks to symmetry considerations , it is possible to predict the value of @xmath89 for some cases .",
    "finally , we will show that given a multipolar order @xmath58 , the average electric effective volume ( it is defined next ) is always smaller than the average magnetic effective volume .",
    "an electric dipole is first supposed to be placed at the origin of the resonator , oriented along the @xmath90 axis , _ i.e. _ @xmath91 .",
    "let us remind that the emitting frequency does not need to be given to compute the effective volumes .",
    "thus , the electromagnetic field emitted by this dipole can be expressed simply as @xmath92 , _",
    "i.e. _ a single multipole ( see appendix ) .",
    "that implies :    @xmath93    then , using eq.([compa ] ) , it is observed that @xmath94 thus , the purcell factor is given by : @xmath95 in table [ tab1 ] , we give the first four effective volumes and frequencies corresponding to @xmath96 units of @xmath97 .",
    ".[tab1]effective volumes and eigenfrequencies associated to modes of the kind @xmath98 , for @xmath96 .",
    "the effective volumes ( @xmath99 ) are computed with respect to an electric dipole oriented along the @xmath90 axis and located in the center of the mie resonator , using eq.([veffgen ] ) .",
    "the resonator is embedded in air , has an index of refraction @xmath87 , and a radius @xmath100 .",
    "the eigenfrequencies ( @xmath101 ) associated to @xmath98 are computed with eq.([oe ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     two observations can be made .",
    "firstly , it is seen that the coupling @xmath102 decreases with the multipolar order @xmath57 .",
    "this result can be interpreted using the radial dependence of multipolar fields .",
    "indeed , the intensity of a multipolar field has a radial dependence that is given by a spherical bessel function @xmath103 .",
    "now , when given a fixed @xmath104 position close to the origin , @xmath105 @xcite . that is",
    ", lower multipolar orders have a non - null intensity in the center of the sphere , whereas the intensity of higher orders is pushed to the surface .",
    "consequently , smaller values of @xmath106 contribute to the integral given by eq.([aveffvol ] ) for most of the points in the domain .",
    "secondly , given a multipolar order @xmath57 , the coupling of the magnetic modes is always smaller than the coupling to the electric ones .",
    "this fact can be understood using eq.([compa ] ) . as we saw for the case of a displaced dipole along the @xmath90 axis , the coupling of a dipolar emitter to magnetic modes is completely suppressed .",
    "this fact changes when the dipoles are not located or oriented along the @xmath90 axis , but the coupling with electric modes ( given by the translation - addition coefficients @xmath107 ) still remains stronger .",
    "finally , we plot @xmath108 for a few normal modes .",
    "this is depicted in fig.[j1 ] and fig.[j2 ] .",
    "note that the results of table [ avvol ] are computed as radial integrals of these plots .     ) for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "large values of @xmath111 indicate good coupling between the uniform distribution of dipoles in the resonator and the mode in consideration . the resonator is embedded in air and is defined by @xmath87 , and @xmath100 .",

    "large values of @xmath111 indicate good coupling between the uniform distribution of dipoles in the resonator and the mode in consideration .",
    "the resonator is embedded in air and is defined by @xmath87 , and @xmath100.,width=604 ]",
    "in conclusion , we derive the purcell factor for magnetic and electric dipolar emitters . we particularize it for the case of spherical mie resonators and emitting electric dipoles . using the eigenfrequencies and the analytic expressions of the normal modes of the system , we analyze the meaning of the effective volume for spherical cavities .",
    "it is seen that its value is related to the multipolar coefficients in the translation - addition formulas .",
    "that is , the effective volume of a normal mode locally quantifies the strength of the coupling of a dipolar emitter to that normal mode . finally , the purcell factor is computed for different symmetric scenarios .",
    "we observe that the magnetic effective volumes are @xmath113 for some symmetric configurations , showing no coupling between the electric emitter and the magnetic modes of the structure .",
    "however , in less symmetric configurations , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "finally , an average effective volume is computed both for electric and magnetic modes , revealing that @xmath114 , _",
    "i.e. _ the coupling to electric modes is generally better than the coupling to magnetic modes .",
    "the situation could be reverted if the effective volumes were computed with dipolar magnetic emitters .",
    "the authors want to thank alexis devilez , brian stout , jean - paul hugonin , christophe sauvan , philippe lalanne and grard colas des francs for fruitful discussions .",
    "this work has been carried out thanks to the support of the a*midex project ( n@xmath115 anr-11-idex-0001 - 02 ) funded by the investissements davenir french government program managed by the french national research agency ( anr ) .",
    "here , we give describe the interaction of a dipolar emitter and a mie resonator . as it is described in @xcite , an emitting dipole is a multipolar field with @xmath109 .",
    "if the dipole is electric , then its associated electric field can be described as @xmath116 with respect to a frame of reference centred on the dipole itself , where @xmath55 depends on the orientation of the dipole .",
    "in fact , @xmath117 if the electric dipole is given by @xmath118 , or @xmath119 if @xmath120 . then , when @xmath116 is expressed with respect to a reference of frame which at a distance @xmath121 of it , the dipolar field is re - expressed as @xmath122 with @xmath74 being the translation - addition coefficients , that can be found in @xcite .",

    "the coefficients @xmath130 are known as mie coefficients when the dipole is outside of the resonator , but take a different form when the dipole is inside of it @xcite .",
