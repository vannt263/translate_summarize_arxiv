    "lifetime of localized surface plasmon ( sp ) in metal nanostructures is one of fundamental problems in plasmonics that has been continuously addressed for more than 40 years @xcite .",
    "the importance of this issue stems from one of the major objectives of plasmonics ",
    "generation of extremely strong local fields at the nanoscale .",
    "the range of physical phenomena and applications related to this goal cuts across physics , chemistry , biology , and device applications .",
    "a small sample of examples includes sp - enhanced spectroscopies of molecules near metal nanostructures , such as surface - enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) and their numerous biomedical applications @xcite , focusing of extremely large electric fields in metal nanoparticle ( np ) clusters @xcite , and quantum coherent sp generation in nanostructures ( spaser ) @xcite .",
    "high ohmic losses in bulk metal due to strong electron - phonon interactions impose limitation on the quantum yield of metal - based plasmonic devices , which can , to some extend , be remedied by reducing the metal component size .",
    "however , at the lengthscale below @xmath0 nm , new limitations on sp lifetime and , consequently , on quantum yield arise due to quantum - size effects . among those ,",
    "the most important is the landau damping ( ld ) of sp  decay of sp into the fermi sea electron - hole pair .",
    "this process is made possible by relaxation of the momentum conservation due to electron surface scattering .",
    "the electron - hole momentum uncertainty , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the characteristic size of nanostructure , translates into the corresponding energy relaxation scale , @xmath3 , @xmath4 being electron mass in metal , and this leads to the following estimate of sp lifetime , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electron fermi velocity ( hereafter we set @xmath7 ) .",
    "the first explicit quantum - mechanical calculation of @xmath8 for spherical np by kawabata and kubo @xcite confirmed the estimate ( [ ld_old ] ) with @xmath2 replaced by particle radius @xmath9 and , for np in vacuum , yielded the value @xmath10 . while the subsequent studies indicated that the coefficient @xmath11 varies in the range ( 0.5 - 2.0 ) depending on dielectric constant and chemical composition of surrounding medium , the size dependence ( [ ld_old ] ) was thoroughly confirmed experimentally for _ spherical _",
    "particles @xcite .",
    "the corresponding quality factor , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is sp frequency , decreases linearly with @xmath9 .",
    "this causes a rapid reduction of , e.g. , sers enhancement factor , @xmath14 , while the other quantum - size effects , such as electron density spillover or surface screening , play a subdominant role @xcite .",
    "the above qualitative arguments have been subsequently used for estimates of sp lifetime in nanostructures of various shapes , notably in metal nanoshells @xcite .",
    "the _ single - electron _ picture of sp damping , based solely on surface scattering , inevitably leads to a sp damping of the form ( [ ld_old ] ) , with @xmath2 replaced by the _",
    "smallest _ spatial scale of a confined nanostructure .",
    "for example , in a nanoshell with shell thickness @xmath15 , the characteristic electron scattering length is @xmath16 , and eq .",
    "( [ ld_old ] ) predicts a very short sp lifetime for thin nanoshells .",
    "first attempts to measure sp lifetime in nanoshells seemed to be consistent with eq .",
    "( [ ld_old ] ) with estimated values @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite . however , more recent systematic studies of optical spectra of single gold nanoshells indicated no size - dependence at all ( @xmath19 ) for the extracted sp lifetime @xcite .",
    "there is also a physical argument that renders eq .",
    "( [ ld_old ] ) invalid for nanostructures of general shape . indeed ,",
    "ld is a _ many - body _",
    "phenomenon , rather than a single - particle one , and it involves the sp own electric field by which an electron - pair is excited .",
    "therefore , the sp lifetime must be highly sensitive to the field _ magnitude _ inside the np .",
    "note that for a solid sphere , the sp electric field magnitude is a frequency - dependent constant that is independent of np radius .",
    "this is the reason why eq .",
    "( [ ld_old ] ) holds remarkably well for spherical np in a very wide range of their radii , from several tens of nm down to nanometer - sized small clusters @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for other np shapes , the magnitude of sp electric field inside the np can change with np size . as we show below , the latter effect can ,",
    "in fact , be much stronger than surface scattering contribution , resulting in a drastically different , from eq .",
    "( [ ld_old ] ) , sp damping rate .    in this paper , we calculate the ld of bright sp modes in a metal nanoshell with dielectric core .",
    "we demostrate that in the limit of _ thin _ nanoshell , the ld rate _",
    "vanishes _ linearly with the nanoshell thickness @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , for small overall nanoshell sizes , sp lifetime exhibits _ quantum beats _ as a function of shell thickness , caused by the interference between electron scattering amplitudes near inner and outer nanoshell boundaries .",
    "we also show that despite the redshift of the sp frequency , the nanoshell quality factor _ increases _ with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "the latter finding indicates that , with appropriate choice of geometry , the quantum - size limitations imposed on plasmonics can be sidelined , and the quantum yield of even small plasmonic devices can be made limited only by the ohmic losses .",
    "in section [ sec : general ] we obtain a formal expression for ld rate in terms of plasmon eigenmodes in metal nanoshell with dielectric core . in section [ sec : u ] we evaluate of nanoshell internal energy , and in section [ sec : q ] we evaluate the dissipated power by calculating the imaginary part of electron polarization operator in semiclassical approximation .",

    "in summary , we performed the first quantum - mechanical calculation of surface plasmon landau damping in a metal nanoshell , and found that it vanishes in the thin shell limit .",
    "the physical origin of a long bright sp lifetime is that its electric field magnitude inside a thin metal shell is reduced .",
    "obviously , such a situation is not limited to nanoshells with spherical symmetry considered here , but can take place in other structures too .",
    "therefore , the quantum - size limitations on plasmon lifetime in small metal nanostructures are , in fact , spurious and can be avoided by an appropriate choice of geometry ."
