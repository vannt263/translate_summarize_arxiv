    "the casimir effect which can be considered as one of the macroscopical observable phenomena originating from the vacuum field fluctuations was firstly discussed by casimir in 1948  @xcite .",
    "casimir predicted that vacuum fluctuations give rise to an attractive force between two neutral conducting plates at rest . in the same year",
    ", casimir and polder also began the pioneering work on the retarded dispersion interaction between two atoms(or molecules )  @xcite . for atoms having a dominant transition with frequency @xmath1 between the ground and first excited states",
    ", they showed that the interaction between the two atoms reduced to the london limit of the van der waals interaction in the near zone , i.e. , @xmath2 dependence for small separations ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in contrast , the interaction energy decays like @xmath0 in the far zone  @xcite .",
    "so far , the casimir and casimir - polder forces have been measured with remarkable precision in experiments  @xcite .",
    "since space - time geometry and the presence of boundaries can affect vacuum field fluctuations , it is expected that the casimir - polder interaction will be modified in these circumstances . in this regard ,",
    "the casimir - polder interaction between two atoms placed near the conducting plate was studied by spagnolo et al  @xcite .",
    "a natural question along that line is what happens when the two - atoms system is placed in curved spacetime rather than a flat spacetime .",
    "this is what we are going to do in the present paper , i.e. , we are going to investigate the casimir - polder potential between two neutral but polarizable atoms outside a spherically symmetric black hole .",
    "let us note , as examples of related effects that also arise as a result of the modification of vacuum fluctuations due to the presence of spacetime curvature , that the lamb shift of a static atom  @xcite and the casimir - polder - like force on it  @xcite outside a schwarzschild black hole have recently been studied .",
    "there are numerous methods aimed at obtaining the casimir - polder potential , such as those using two - transverse - photon exchange within perturbation theory  @xcite , consideration of the changes in zero - point energy  @xcite , radiative reaction  @xcite , evaluation of energy shifts in the heisenberg picture  @xcite , the method based on spatial vacuum field correlations@xcite , the response theory  @xcite and so on . a general treatment within a relativistic framework is reviewed by feinberg and sucher  @xcite .",
    "our calculation of the interatomic casimir - polder potential is based upon the method of equal - time spatial vacuum field correlations which can simplify some calculations in some complex external environment .",
    "the main idea based on the vacuum spatial correlations can be narrated as that the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field induce instantaneous correlated dipole moments on the two atoms and the casimir - polder potential energy can be obtained by calculating the classical interaction between the two correlated induced dipoles  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will give the basic formula of interatomic casimir - polder potential between the two ground - state atoms in the far zone .",
    "then we will calculate casimir - polder potential caused by induced instantaneous atomic dipoles generated by electromagnetic field fluctuations in the boulware vacuum  @xcite , unruh vacuum  @xciteand hartle - hawking vacuum  @xcite , in secs .",
    "iii , iv , and v respectively .",
    "finally , we will conclude in sec .",
    "within the dipole approximation , the hamiltonian of a system composed of two atoms a and b interacting with external radiation fields in the multipolar scheme can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the transverse displacement electric field operator at the point @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) indicates the electric dipole operator of atom a ( or b ) .",
    "for the two atoms which are fixed at the certain locations in a space - time , the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field induce instantaneous correlated dipole moments on them as a result of the spatially correlated vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the casimir - polder potential energy then can be considered as the ( classical ) interaction between the two correlated induced dipoles .",
    "the induced dipole moments caused by the vacuum fluctuations usually can be written as  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the atomic dynamical isotropic polarizability ( here @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the matrix elements of the atomic dipole moment operator ) . for the case of a two - level atom ,",
    "the isotropic polarizability can be written as @xmath13    therefore , the interatomic casimir - polder potential of two ground - state atoms reads  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the equal - time spatial correlation function of the electric field in the vacuum state and @xmath16 is the classical electrostatic interaction energy between two dipoles oscillating at frequency @xmath17  @xcite @xmath18-(\\delta_{ij}-\\hat{r_i}\\hat{r_j})\\frac{\\omega^2_{\\bf k}\\cos(\\omega_{\\bf { k}}r)}{r}\\;,\\ ] ] where the distance of the two atoms is denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the @xmath21-th element of the unit displacement vector of @xmath22 . in the far zone ( @xmath23 ) , the retardation effect becomes significant , and we can replace the dynamical polarizabilities @xmath24 with their static polarizabilities @xmath25  @xcite",
    ". then we can write eq .",
    "( [ vab ] ) in the far zone as @xmath26    for a schwarzschild black hole , there are three vacuum states which can be defined by the nonoccupation of positive frequency modes , i.e. , the boulware , hartle - hawking and unruh vacua . in the following , we will examine in detail eq .",

    "the line element of the space - time is given by @xmath27 where m is the mass of the black hole .",
    "now we suppose that the field is in a vacuum state , and for simplicity , the two atoms are fixed along the same radial direction(see fig .",
    "( [ tu1 ] ) ) .",

    "besides these , it should be pointed out that @xmath37 in eq .",
