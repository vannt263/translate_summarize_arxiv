    "mbm 12 is a high latitude molecular cloud and since it has @xmath17 exceeding 5 mag , @xcite , it is classified as a dark cloud . and it contains more than a dozen pms stars .",
    "an active high latitude cloud requires possibly other mechanisms for star formation than dark clouds close to the galactic plane . estimating parameters essential for initiating star formation , such as the cloud mass and density , depends on the cloud distance .",
    "we include mbm 16 , a high latitude neighboring tranclucent cloud , only ten degrees removed from mbm 12 , and showing no star formation . for a recent review of high latitude molecular clouds @xcite may be consulted .",
    "the mbm 12 distance has a long long history and a corresponding , large variation . shortly after its inclusion in the mbm catalog @xcite suggested @xmath365 pc as derived from nai spectroscopy and spectroscopic distances of a small sample of stars .",
    "@xcite suggest the same distance for mbm 16 about ten degrees away from mbm 12 .",
    "the estimate for mbm 12 was altered by @xcite , after hipparcos parallaxes became available , to the range from 58 to 90 pc .",
    "again lower and upper estimates were based on the absence / presence of nai absorbtion . @xcite and @xcite have used more indirect methods and prefer a cloud distance of 275 pc and 360@xmath1830 pc , respectively .",
    "both of these papers do , however , detect dust , thought not to be associated to mbm 12 , at 65 , 140 pc and at @xmath380 pc respectively .",
    "an intermediary distance , 325 pc , is proposed by @xcite from vilnius photometry of dwarfs and giants brighter than v@xmath212 mag . that work also indicates the possible presence of a small hump , @xmath19 0.4 mag , of extinction at 140@xmath4160 pc .",
    "accurate and homogenous sdss @xmath20 photometry has proven useful for deriving distances and extinction estimates for stars in the m dwarf range within @xmath21 kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our own interest in using @xmath21 photometry for 3-d mapping of the ism was inspired by the stellar models by @xcite .",
    "these models convinced us that the position of the @xmath22 locus was influenced very little by variation in [ m / h ] , and by ages varying from a few million years to the age of the milky way .",
    "the latter invariance was perhaps to be expected .",
    "furthermore , and most important , the reddening ratio @xmath23 has a value , @xcite , that approximates the slope of the main sequence , in the @xmath24 diagram , for dwarfs earlier than @xmath3m1 .",
    "a consequence is , that reddening seems to be the only parameter that shifts observed @xmath1 , @xmath25 pairs away from the intrinsic locus .",
    "another fact that makes the @xmath21 photometry so useful for m dwarfs is the good relation , @xmath260.4 mag , between @xmath27 and the absolute magnitude @xmath28 : a range of @xmath2 2 mag in @xmath27 corresponds to a range of @xmath29 mag in @xmath28 .",
    "this is taken from table 2 of @xcite together with the equation for @xmath6 , table 4 of @xcite valid for the 0.62 @xmath4 2.82 range of @xmath27 .",
    "the absolute magnitude calibration have required precise distances for a represensative sample , table 4.1 , @xcite .",
    "we apply the photometric parallax and investigate the variation of extinction with distance in a region with a radius 15@xmath29 centered on the high latitude , dark cloud mbm 12 .",
    "this region is known to contain several clouds with molecular gas , e.g. the extended translucent cloud mbm 16 .",
    "the locations of these clouds are interesting because of their various state of activity and their position relative to the confinement of the local cavity .",

    "the resulting color excesses are color coded , width=332 ]    to establish a sample of m dwarfs we follow a selection procedure in line with @xcite .",
    "the candidate sample is drawn from the most recent sdss data release , dr8 , applied for a region , centered on the mbm 12 position @xmath32 with a 15@xmath29 radius , as shown in fig .",
    "the coverage is incomplete but several mbms are partially scanned . using the dr8 casjobs tool we queried for star objects with clean photometry for @xmath33 , @xmath5 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , and fulfilling the selection criteria : @xmath36 0.06 mag , @xmath37 0.53 mag and @xmath38 0.3 mag .",
    "the cuts in @xmath25 and @xmath39 contribute to minimize the contamination by ( partially ) eliminating quasars , giants and m flare stars .",

    "the linchpin for our work is the @xmath44 diagram , which is characterized by showing only minor @xmath45 variation for m dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath44 reddening vector has a slope almost identical to the slope of the main sequence earlier than @xmath3m1-m2 meaning that reddened dwarfs earlier than this limit do not contaminate the location of reddened dwarfs later than @xmath3m2 .",

    "m dwarf activity in the form of flares mostly effects the blue part of the spectrum , i.e. the @xmath47 and the @xmath33 bands implying that @xmath48 is affected but not @xmath5 . according to @xcite a flare will typically change @xmath48 to values below 0.05 mag . as fig .",

    "blue symbols signify m dwarfs in the mbm 16 area .",
    "true color excesses are positive but due to observational errors in @xmath25 and @xmath1 unreddened and little reddened stars are sometimes shifted to the blue of the @xmath46 locus . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we have indicated the one sigma confinement based on the maximum error 0.060 mag in @xmath53 .",
    "this confinement is corroborated by the scatter around the standard locus of m dwarfs observed at the virtually unreddened north galactic pole .      as the sample of nearby m dwarfs",
    ", forming the basis for the standard locus , shows there is a scatter around the standard locus even for vitually unreddened stars . but collapsing the main sequence to a sharp relation has often proven useful . in a previous section",
    "we have argued that a shift from the locus may mainly depend on reddening .",
    "the intrinsic location of a dwarf is on the locus and is determined by translating the observed position along a reddening vector .",

    "each entry in the extraction from sdss dr8 contains errors on all magnitudes but we have preselected stars with @xmath30 0.060 mag .",
    "we may estimate the total uncertainty from the combination of observational errors and errors introduced from the calibrations .    if @xmath64 represents either the full set of equations used to estimate @xmath8 or @xmath28 the formal error of @xmath65 follows from the progression formula :    @xmath66    for each star we compute @xmath67 and @xmath68 implying that derivatives must be calculated and errors of the independent parameters also must be known .",
    "the errors @xmath69 and @xmath70 are derived from piecemeal linear approximations to the intrinsic locus , taking into account errors in slope and intersection , together with the observational errors in @xmath71 and @xmath34 .",

    "there are some mbm 12 stars with extinction @xmath21 mag at @xmath2125 pc but the dominating increase takes place at @xmath3162 pc indicated by a vertical line too .",
    "since this distance is somewhat smaller than the presently preferred range discussed in the introduction we have compared to the distance @xmath79 extinction variation derived from the hipparcos catalog .",

    "parallaxes are from the second derivation by @xcite and extinctions are from @xmath82 , @xmath83 photometry and spectral classification , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the extinction is averaged in 30 pc intervals and is given as the blue solid curve in fig .",
    "the hipparcos curve is seen to follow the upper envelope of the mbm 12 extinction rather well .",
    "since the hipparcos sample has a rather bright limiting magnitude , @xcite , we can only expect to see smaller extinctions .",

    "one may expect that for a small distance bin at a given distance the average extinctions in a cloud direction and outside the clouds differ . for distances less than the cloud distance , but in the direction of a cloud",
    ", the two averages will be more similar . as fig .",
    "[ f3 ] shows there is a substantial scatter of @xmath8 at almost any distance . a scatter caused by real variation in the presence of dust causing the extinction and the observational errors ,",

    "we use @xmath85 as a measure of the significance of @xmath13 and define the cloud distance as the distance when @xmath13/@xmath14 equals three .",
    "we have done this for the mbm 12 area and compared to the region outside the mbm 12 area as shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath13/@xmath14=3 criterion indicates a distance 100 pc for mbm 16 as shown in fig .",
    "we have applied two different methods , which perhaps could be termed qualitative and quantitative , respectively , for estimating the distance to the two high latitude clouds mbm 12 and 16 : the distance at which substantial extinction is first measured and the distance where the ratio @xmath13/@xmath14 equals three . in the case of mbm 12 and 16",

    "the possibility that mbm 12 is outside the confinement of the local bubble and mbm 16 is on or inside still exist . tempting to suggest that their dark / translucent status is a consequence of their different interstellar environment ?",
    "the @xmath13/@xmath14 = 3 criterion may possibly be expanded to a generalized method for locating nearby molecular clouds where @xmath20 photometry is available and maps , 2d and 3d , could be produced with a larger number of stars than used in the spectroscopic study by @xcite .",
