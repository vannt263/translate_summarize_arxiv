    "the general idea that x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have similar central engines , if scaled with black hole mass , is increasingly supported by empirical correlations connecting both classes .",
    "first , the fundamental plane of accreting black holes connects xrbs and agn through a plane in the black hole mass , radio and x - ray luminosity space @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported that a second plane connecting stellar and supermassive black holes exists in the space defined by the accretion rate , the black hole mass and a characteristic timescale of the x - ray variability .",
    "this suggests that all black holes can be unified by taking the accretion rate as well as the black hole mass into account . here , we explore the latter correlation in further detail and discuss the inclusion of strongly sub - eddington black holes ( bhs ) and neutron stars ( nss )",
    ".    the power spectral density ( psd ) of ns and bh xrbs can be well described by a number of lorentzians with variable coherence factor q ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each lorentzian is described by their characteristic frequency ( the frequency of the maximum of the lorentzian in the frequency times power plot ) . as presented in @xcite , it is possible to fit nss and bhs with    * a zero - centered low frequency lorentzian @xmath0 fitting the low - frequency end of the band - limited noise with characteristic frequency @xmath1 .",
    "usually , this frequency is denoted as @xmath2 in the literature .",
    "however , to avoid confusion with the break frequency studied in agn , we add the prefix `` l '' for low . * two lorentzians fitting the high - frequency end of the band - limited noise with frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( the lower and upper high - frequency lorentzian @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "these two lorentzians take over the role of the upper and lower khz qpo if they are present . *",
    "one or two lorentzians fitting the region around the frequency of the low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) .",
    "the narrow core of the qpo ( @xmath7 ) has the characteristic frequency @xmath8 , while the broader `` hump '' lorentzian @xmath9 has a characteristic frequency @xmath10 .    for a sketch showing",

    "xrbs are observed in several states : the hard , the soft and the intermediate state ( ims ) . for definitions , subclasses and examples",
    "see e.g. , @xcite , but see also @xcite for slightly different definitions .",
    "the measured shapes of agn psds are similar to those of soft - state xrbs ( see e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the timescales for agn are several orders of magnitudes longer , roughly in agreement with the expectation that all length - scales increase linearly with black hole mass .",
    "the uncertainties of the measured agn psds are usually too large to fit a detailed lorentzian model ( but see mchardy et al . in prep . ) , due to the long timescales .",
    "thus , one uses broken power law models .",
    "the shape of the psd of agn and xrbs at high fourier frequencies is well described by a power law with index @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . for seyfert galaxies and those soft - state xrbs similar to cyg",
    "x-1 the psd at low fourier frequencies turns to a power law with index @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ fisketch ] , @xcite ) .",
    "the fourier frequency of the turnover will be denoted as the high - break frequency @xmath13 . using the bolometric luminosity as a tracer for the accretion rate",
    ", @xcite found that this high - break frequency is related to the accretion rate and black hole mass as @xmath14 for soft - state objects .",
    "it has recently been found by @xcite that for the bh gx 339 - 4 the frequency of the lower high - frequency lorentzian @xmath3 and for the ns 4u  1728 - 34 the frequency of the `` hump''-lorentzian @xmath10 is correlated with the radio luminosity in their hard state as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes either @xmath3 or @xmath10 .",
    "as the radio luminosity is a good tracer of the accretion rate ( @xcite , @xmath17 ) , the correlation can be written as @xmath18 .",
    "it is therefore suggestive that the `` variability plane '' found for high state xrbs and agn can be extended to hard - state bhs or even nss .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fisketch ] the superposition of the different lorentzians ( @xmath19 , @xmath9 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) creates a flat plateau in the @xmath20 plots , and the psd can therefore be roughly described with power law with index @xmath12 for frequencies between @xmath21 and @xmath3 .",
    "this power law steepens to a power law with index @xmath11 at the peak of the high - frequency lorentzians ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) similar to the behaviour found in soft - state xrbs and agn .",
    "it is therefore likely , that the frequency of either the upper or lower high - frequency lorentzian ( @xmath4 or @xmath3 ) correspond to the high break frequency found in soft - state xrbs and agn .",
    "the lower high - frequency lorentzian @xmath5 usually dominates the high - frequency end of the band limited noise ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are not linearly coupled ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the frequency of the lower high - frequency lorentizan @xmath3 seems to be proportional to @xmath22 , @xmath4 is therefore not linearly proportional to @xmath22 for individual sources .",
    "this suggests , that the lower high - frequency lorentzian @xmath5 with the characteristic frequency @xmath3 corresponds to the high break frequency of agn .",
    "we note that for ns one observes `` parallel tracks '' for khz qpos on frequency flux diagrams ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", while flux and frequencies are strongly correlated for short periods of time , the correlation is nearly absent for longer timescales .",
    "if the x - ray luminosity ( flux ) is a good tracer of the accretion rate , there can not be a simple one to one dependence of the frequency @xmath3 of the lower high - frequency lorentzian on accretion rate .",
    "however , there are at least three possible tracers of the accretion rate ( frequencies , x - ray luminosity and radio luminosity ) and the frequencies or the radio luminosity might be better indicators than the x - ray luminosity .    @xcite present a correlation of the frequencies of the lower khz qpo with those of the low frequency qpo @xmath8 .",
    "this correlation can be extended to include noise features of bhxrbs by using the lower high - frequency lorentzian @xmath5 as the lower khz qpo .",
    "also cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) can be included by using dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos , e.g. , @xcite ) and the qpo frequency . here ,",
    "we explore if the varability plane found in sort state agn and xrbs can also be extended to hard - state bh xrbs and nss or even to white dwarfs .",
    "to explore the dependence of the variability properties on the accretion rate and mass of the compact object , we construct a sample of hard and soft - state bhs and nss with estimated accretion rates .",
    "soft state bhs and all nss are generally assumed to be efficiently accreting .",
    "thus , we can use the bolometric luminosity directly as a measure of the accretion rate : @xmath23 where we assumed an accretion efficiency of @xmath24 .    for hard - state bhs",
    "the accretion rate is not linearly related to the x - ray as the accretion flow is likely to be inefficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite provide estimates of the accretion rates from either radio or x - ray luminosities .",
    "the accretion measure based on the radio luminosity is @xmath25 in the notation given in @xcite we have set @xmath26 and @xmath24 to allow for a direct comparison between hard - state bhs and sources with a measured accretion rate obtained from the bolometric luminosity . using the fundamental plane of accreting black holes ( and the radio / x - ray correlation for xrbs ) the radio luminosity accretion measure",
    "can be translated to an accretion rate estimate based on the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity : @xmath27 we note , that this accretion measure does not only depend on the x - ray luminosity but also on the mass of the black hole . while the masses of bh xrbs are typically around @xmath28 this mass - term provides an additional uncertainty compared to the accretion rate measure based on the radio luminosity .",
    "thus , we will estimate the accretion rate from the radio luminosity if quasi - simultaneous measurements of the radio flux and the timing features are available .",
    "otherwise , we have to use the x - ray flux to obtain an accretion rate estimate .",
    "the uncertainty of these accretion rate measures is hard to access as there are only a few data - points available to normalise the accretion measure .",
    "the sample standard - deviation of the 4 bh data - points is @xmath29 dex , but has little significance .",
    "if one includes also the ns points ( overall 14 points ) we find a scatter of @xmath30 dex .",
    "another possibility to measure the uncertainty of the accretion measure is via the fundamental plane of accreting bhs .",
    "if both accretion measures ( based on the radio and x - ray emission ) presented here are exact , there would be no scatter in radio / x - ray correlation found for xrbs and the fundamental plane for xrbs and agn .",
    "the scatter around the fundamental plane can therefore be used as rough estimator of the uncertainty of the accretion rate measure .",
    "the cleanest sample for the fundamental plane including only hard - state xrbs and low luminosity agn has a scatter of 0.15 dex @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the uncertainties of the accretion rate measure based on radio luminosity is around @xmath30 dex .",
    "the accretion rate measure based on the x - ray luminosity will have a similar intrinsic uncertainty , but has additional uncertainties due to uncertainties of the bh mass estimates .",
    "the accretion rate measure based on the radio luminosity is also applicable to island state ns .",
    "however , as the radio luminosity accretion rate measure has been normalised using accretion rates obtained from bolometric luminosities its absolute accuracy is unlikely to exceed the measure based on bolometric luminosities for efficiently accretion objects . in summary",
    "we will use the following accretion rate measures in order of preference :    1 .",
    "accretion rates from bolometric luminosity for soft - state bhs and nss 2 .",
    "accretion rates estimated from the radio luminosity for hard - state bhs 3 .",
    "accretion rates estimated from the x - ray luminosity for hard - state bhs    throughout this paper we will measure the accretion rate in g / s , all frequencies in hz and masses of compact objects in solar masses .      our hard - state bh sample is based on measurements in the public rxte archive as well as already published data .",
    "we select all sources which have well measurable frequencies @xmath3 as well as estimates for the black hole mass and distance .",
    "however , in order to obtain an estimate of @xmath3 one needs a hard - state power spectrum , since in the hard - intermediate state characteristic frequencies are higher and the broad lower high - frequency lorentzian ( @xmath5 ) can not usually be detected ( with the exception of grs 1915 + 105 ) .",
    "moreover , the source count rate needs to be sufficiently high to allow a detection .",
    "this rules out the final parts of the outbursts and limits our sample to bright early hard - state observations .",
    "unfortunately , only few sources have been observed sufficiently early in their outburst to fulfill all the requirements :    * _ gx  339 - 4 _ : @xcite present values for @xmath3 and the radio fluxes of gx  339 - 4 in its hard state .",
    "these radio fluxes have been used to estimate the accretion rate . the distance",
    "to gx  339 - 4 is still uncertain , @xcite and @xcite give a lower limit of 6 kpc , but the distance may be as high as 15 kpc @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt a distance of @xmath31 kpc .",
    "the mass function is @xmath32 @xmath33 @xcite , which is therefore a lower limit for the mass of the black hole .",
    "if one assumes zero mass for the companion and a mean inclination angle we obtain a mass of @xmath34 .",
    "additionally , this higher mass fits the fundamental plane as well as timing correlations better than smaller masses .",
    "thus , we use @xmath35 . * _ xte j1118 + 480 _ : @xcite measured @xmath3 for xte j1118 + 480 on the 4th and 15th may 2000 . the vla has observed the source during that time .",
    "we have analysed archival 8.5 ghz data and found a flux of 5.7 mjy on the 27th april , 6.4 mjy on the 13th may , and 6.8 mjy on the 31st may .",
    "we interpolate linearly between those dates and estimate the 8.5 ghz flux on the 4th of may to be 5.9 mjy and 6.4 mjy on the 15th may and estimate the accretion rate from these radio fluxes .",

    "the majority of the uncertainties just mentioned do not play a role if one only considers only a single source as they would only change the normalisation constant @xmath63 .",
    "thus , we can safely assume that there is a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath22 for individual sources .",
    "whether the constant offset @xmath63 is significantly different for hard and soft - state objects need to be verified .    to access the value and uncertainty of the constant offset @xmath63 for our sample of sources we use two approaches :",

    "we find @xmath68 with a sample variance of @xmath69 .",
    "however , as many of the errors of the data - points are coupled we might underestimate the uncertainty of the mean .    to avoid the coupling of the uncertainties for different data - points of a given source we first treat every source individually and combine the different sources in a second step taking the estimated errors into account . to calculate the error on the mean @xmath63 we used the following steps :    1 .",
    "calculate @xmath63 for each source individually and measure the intrinsic scatter around the linear correlation through the sample variance @xmath70 .",
    "2 .   estimate the uncertainty of the measured @xmath63 for all sources .",
    "we set @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the uncertainty of the measurement of the distance , @xmath73 the mass uncertainty and @xmath74 the systematic uncertainty of the @xmath22-measure .",
    "3 .   calculate that weighted mean and error of mean with the estimated uncertainties .",
    "each source is weighted by their uncertainties and the number of measurements of the source .    using this method",
    ", we find @xmath75 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath63 is in agreement with the value found using the sample variance .",
    "finally , we have to consider that the overall normalisation of the accretion rate measure has an uncertainty of @xmath30 dex .",
    "this uncertainty is shared by all data - points and all errors in the estimate of the normalisation effects the mean value of @xmath63 directly . if we include this uncertainty we obtain an overall error of @xmath76 dex .",
    "as the difference between the normalisation found for the hard and the soft state is 0.9 dex , we conclude that the difference between the hard and the soft - state scaling is significant .",
    "using this meathod we can also calculate the expected mean variance of the correlation given the assumed uncertainties .",
    "we find @xmath77 , which is larger than the sample variance of @xmath69 .",
    "the discrepance is mainly due to the coupled uncertainties , but we may also have overestimated the uncertainties of the accretion estimator or those of the distance and mass measurements .    only for gx  339 - 4 and xtr j1118 + 480 we have used the radio luminosity to obtain accretion rates while for the other hard - state objects we used the 2 - 10 kev flux .",
    "we have verified that fig .",
    "[ figbhs ] does not change significantly if we use the accretion rate measure based on the x - ray flux for all sources .",
    "this is not surprising , as the accretion rate measure used for the x - ray flux is partly based on the radio / x - ray correlation of gx  339 - 4 .",
    "thus , our findings are not affected by our choice of different the accretion rate estimators .",
    "the outbursts of xte  j1550 - 564 in 1998 and 2000 seem to follow a different track than the linear dependence seen in the hard - state outburst in 2002 and the other hard - state objects .",
    "the first two outbursts rise more steeply than the linear hard - state scaling .",
    "the outbursts seem to start at a frequency @xmath3 characteristic for a hard state and lead to values typically found for soft states . in these outbursts",
    "the photon index changes strongly during the observations . in 1998",
    "the first observation in our sample has a photon index of @xmath78 @xcite which changes continuesly to the last observation which has @xmath79 , which is atypical for the hard state were one would expect the photon index to stay hard until the state transition . in the 2000 outburst",
    "the source is also softening from @xmath80 to @xmath81 while the power law cutoff moves from 33 kev to 19 kev with a significant black - body component visible in the last observation used ( a typical cut - off for the hard state is @xmath82 kev ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that the source was already in an intermediate state in these outbursts .",
    "this suggests that there is one scaling relation for the classical hard state and one with a higher normalisation for the soft state , but there is obviously another parameter that governs the transition between those scaling relations . during the transition from the hard to the soft state , the source increases its frequency fast and moves from the hard scaling to the soft one .    for xrbs the transition from the soft to the hard scaling",
    "is probably best traced by the spectral index @xmath83 . a strong correlation between timing properties and",
    "the photon index has been found in objects near the intermediate states , see e.g. , @xcite . a simple dependence on the photon index is however not directly applicable to agn .",
    "the timing properties are also correlated to the hardness ratio see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the hardness ratio can be generalised to the non - thermal fraction @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the luminosity in the multi - color black body component while @xmath86 describes the luminosity of the power law component . this non - thermal fraction has similar properties as the hardness ratio but is also applicable to agn ( see @xcite ) .",
    "sources solidly in the soft state @xmath87 follow a track given by @xmath88 , while those in the hard state @xmath89 follow @xmath90 .",
    "in the transition between both states , the frequencies depend on the photon index and therefore on @xmath91 .",
    "this suggests that the dependence of @xmath92 on @xmath53 , @xmath22 and @xmath91 can be approximated by : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a monotonic function with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "unfortunately , with the readily available data of state transitions we are not able to fully constrain it .",
    "we note that this dependence may have to be further modified due to hysteresis effects similar to those seen in hardness - intensity diagrams .      in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ finss ] we show our sample of nss with visible broad lower high - frequency lorentzians @xmath97 together with the stellar bhs .",
    "the low luminosity x - ray burster and the accreting millisecond pulsar lie near the expected scaling for hard - state bhs  but with increased scatter .",
    "also our atoll sources are in a similar frequency range . however , while we could observe the linear dependency of @xmath3 on accretion rate in some single sources for bhs ( ie .",
    ", xte j1550 - 564 and gx  339 - 4 ) this is harder for the nss , since the accretion rate changes in our sample are small .",
    "the only object changing its accretion rate significantly is igr j00291 + 5934 . for that source , the slope seems to be slightly shallower than what is found for the bhs .",
    "however , as already mentioned , a second source ( v507 cas ) is in the field of view of the pca , so it is hard to measure correct fluxes for the pulsar",
    ". it may be that we are underestimating the lowest detected fluxes . as a sample the ns sources still scatter around the correlation found for hard - state bhs , albeit with a larger scatter .",
    "@xcite present a tight correlation between the frequencies of the low frequency qpo @xmath98 and those of the lower khz qpo in nss and bhs . in the unified picture",
    "of @xcite the lower khz qpo found in some nss is identified with the broad lower high - frequency lorentzian @xmath5 for bhs and weakly accreting nss . as the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath99 holds for some sources on the @xmath8/@xmath3 correlation , it may be possible that one can extend our accretion rate @xmath3 correlation to all sources on the @xcite correlation .",
    "we have just shown , that atoll sources with a measured frequency @xmath3 roughly follow the variability plane . at higher accretion rates",
    "atoll sources show a lower khz qpo at significantly higher frequencies than the observed values of @xmath3 at low accretion rates ( when the lower khz qpo is observed the broad lower high - frequency lorentzian @xmath5 is not seen ) .",
    "however , the increase in the accretion rate is not sufficient to ensure that the lower khz qpo is in agreement with the correlation .",
    "this can be also shown by looking at @xmath10 for 1728 - 34 .",
    "@xmath10 is the frequency corresponding to the broad `` hump '' lorentzian ( @xmath9 ) of the low frequency qpo .",
    "thus @xmath10 and the frequency of the low frequency qpo are well correlated and have roughly similar values . as we show on the right side of fig .",
    "[ finss ] , @xmath10 is ( at least for 1728 ) near the correlation .",
    "thus , the lower khz qpo will be above the correlation by a factor @xmath100 .",
    "z - sources have significantly higher accretion rates than atoll sources and often show khz qpos .",
    "the frequencies of the lower khz qpos of z - sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ finss ] .",
    "the accretion rates are so large that the frequencies of the lower khz qpo of z - sources are near the hard - state correlation . however , z - sources are very strongly accreting , e.g. , they belong to a bright ims",
    ". these sources should therefore follow the high state slope similar to the bh grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the lower khz qpo frequencies are so high , that they have the same order of magnitude as the keplerian frequency at the surface of the neutron star @xmath101 .",
    "thus , it may be that the frequencies start to saturate and are therefore slightly below the high state correlation .",
    "see also the discussion on wd and the corresponding fig .",
    "[ fiwdbreakup ] where this effect may be even more pronounced .",
    "the slope of the z - sources alone seems to be steeper than the correlation found for bhs .",
    "it may be , that while the accretion rate does not change very much the sources makes a state transition from the analog of the hard ims to the soft ims ( horizontal branch to normal branch ) . as we have seen for bhs , during state transitions the source moves",
    "rapidly form the hard - state scaling to the soft - state scaling .",
    "this rapid transition explain the steeper slope of z - sources .",
    "nevertheless , as the khz qpos of atoll sources do not fit on the correlation we can not be sure if it is not pure coincidence that the z - sources seem to follow the correlation . for the correlation we therefore have to rely on sources with measured @xmath3 .",
    "we have mentioned in the introduction that the `` parallel tracks '' found in flux frequency diagrams may suggest that the frequency of the khz qpo may be a better tracer of the instantaneous accretion rate than the x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "we are currently unable to use any frequency as a direct tracer of the accretion rate as the conversion factors are yet unknown .",
    "as we have shown it is likely that the frequency ( @xmath3 ) does not only depend on the accretion rate but also on the state of the source .",
    "thus , at least @xmath3 can not be used as a measure of the accretion rate for all times if one does not have detailed information on the state of the source . if the frequency of the lower high - frequency lorentzian does not only depend on the accretion rate but also on an additional parameter describing the accretion state",
    ", one could explain the parallel tracks . on short timescales",
    "the main parameter is either the accretion rate or the accretion rate and the accretion state parameter are strongly coupled creating the well correlated tracks . on longer timescales",
    "the relationship of the two parameter can change so that one observes parallel tracks .    the final edge - on projection of the variability plane including bh xrbs , ns xrbs with directly measured @xmath3 and agn is shown in fig .",

    ", the dwarf - nova oscillation ( dno ) frequency corresponds to the frequency @xmath3 of the lower high - frequency lorentzian . in table",
    "[ tabcvs ] we tabulate the parameters of four well known systems .",
    "the accretion rates of cvs have higher uncertainties than those of nss or bhs , as the majority of the bolometric luminosity is not emitted in the well accessable x - ray band .",
    "we assume that the accretion rates are only correct up to a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "especially the accretion rate for vw hyi is uncertain , as we use the quiescent value as a lower limit to the accretion rate , while the dno frequencies are measured during the end of the decline from an outburst .",
    "thus , the accretion rate will be approximately the quiescent rate .",
    "nevertheless , observed values of @xmath102 are mostly around -1.6 , while we expect values between 0.1 and 3 ( assuming that they follow the soft - state scaling ) .",
    "thus , in the current form , the correlation is not valid for cvs ( see fig .  [ fiwd ] ) .",
    "we note that , for cvs , the dno frequency rises with accretion rate @xcite , similar to the expected behaviour of the correlation .",
    "however , up to now we have not considered that a white dwarf is significantly larger than a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "it is not evident how to correct the correlation for the larger radius . for bhs",
    "the radius is linearly related to the bh mass .",
    "thus , the correlation found for bhs suggests that one or both mass terms of the correlation correspond to a radius .",
    "if one of the mass terms corresponds to a radius , the correlation reads @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the radius of the central object .",
    "this correlation can be read as a correlation between @xmath3 and the power liberated in the accretion disk around the central object divided by @xmath105 .",
    "the power liberated in a standard accretion disk around a central object with radius @xmath104 is @xmath106 times smaller than the power liberated in a disk around a non - rotating bh , the one radius term corrects for this fact . a white dwarf of average mass has a radius roughly @xmath107 times larger than that of a ns .",
    "this would move the expected position of oy car and vw hyi near our correlations ( see fig .",
    "[ fiwdbreakup ] ) .",
    "their positions are in agreement with the correlation given the large uncertainties on the accretion rates .",
    "ix vel and ux uma , however , are still far from the correlation .",
    "those two sources are nova - likes , with high accretion rates .",
    "if the correlation would hold for all those sources , their frequencies would exceed the breakup frequency of the white dwarf @xmath108 hz . if the dno frequency ( or @xmath3 ) is somehow related to the keplerian rotation this is impossible .",
    "thus , it is likely that the sources follow the correlation until the frequencies are comparable to the fastest possible frequency ( breakup frequency for wds and the frequency of the innermost stable orbit for bhs ) . for these high accretion rates the frequencies can not increase any further and stay constant around the fastest possible frequency .",
    "schematic frequency tracks for wds , bhs and nss are shown in fig .",
    "[ fiwdbreakup ] .",
    "the shown lines should only illustrate possible frequency tracks . as the break up frequencies are reached at high luminosities the shown tracks are normalised to the high state correlation .",
    "the shown function is a smooth broken power law which is linear with @xmath22 at low accretion rates and constant at high accretion rates ( @xmath109 ) . if one assumes that both mass terms of the correlation correspond to radii , none of the measured wds fall on the expected correlation .",
    "thus , we consider it to be more likely that only one mass term corresponds to a radius . in summary , while dwarf novae systems seem to lie near the correlation if one takes the size of the central object into account , nova - like objects do not seem to follow the correlation as their frequencies would exceed the break up frequency of the wd .",
    "in the previous section we found that the variability plane found in soft - state accreting black holes @xcite can be extended to hard - state stellar black holes ( see fig .  [ figbhs ] ) .",
    "the frequencies depend on the accretion rate @xmath110 and the black hole mass @xmath111 as : @xmath112 for soft - state objects ; for hard - state objects the proportionality factor is @xmath29 .",
    "it is even possible to extend the correlation to ns with directly measured frequencies @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ finsbh ] ) . here ,",
    "we discuss the physical implications of these findings .",
    "this dependence on the accretion rate as well as on the black hole mass can be simplified by assuming that the accreting black hole is scale invariant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the frequency arises through keplerian motion or any other process scaling with the size of the central object , the left side of the equation is invariant of black hole mass .",
    "the right side denotes a simple linear dependence on the accretion rate in eddington units .",
    "while a linear dependency on the accretion rate is seen if a source is in the canonical hard or soft state this is not the case for sources in intermediate states or near the state transition .",
    "for example , we have seen that xte  j1550 - 564 follows the linear scaling in its hard outburst in 2002 , while the frequencies rise faster than linear for the other outbursts .",
    "thus , besides accretion rate there must be at least a second parameter governing the observed frequencies ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "similar to the hysteresis found for state changes , ( see e.g , the hardness intensity diagrams of xrb outbursts , ) there seems to be a hysteresis effect for the frequencies ( see fig .  7 in @xcite ) .    in case",
    "the high - frequency break originates from keplerian motion or a frequency that is related to the keplerian frequency , we can use eq .",
    "( [ eqfinal ] ) to obtain the dependence of the active radius @xmath114 , which corresponds to the break in the psd , on the accretion rate .",
    "this yields : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the gravitational radius @xmath117 .",
    "the correlation with the accretion rate therefore implies that the radius associated with the break moves inwards with @xmath118 .",
    "interestingly , such a behaviour may be observed in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "@xcite reports that the disk radius associated with the region emitting the measured x - ray spectrum changes from 70 km to roughly 20 km while the rxte / pca count rate increases by a factor of @xmath119 .",
    "if the bolometric correction does not change significantly between the different observations , this suggests that the emitting radius moves inwards as @xmath120 compared to our prediction of @xmath121 .",
    "it is tempting to associate the active region creating the high - frequency break with the transition from the geometrically thin standard disk to the optically thin inefficient accretion flow .",
    "however , most of our objects are soft - state objects . within the soft state",
    "it is usually assumed that the optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk reaches up to the last stable orbit .",
    "the luminosities of a given source in the soft state can change by a factor 15 ( 2 - 30% eddington ) , so the inner disk radius would have to change by a factor 6 .",
    "this is not in agreement with the redii deduced from x - ray spectral fitting nor with observed scaling of the x - ray luminosities with disc temperature as @xmath122 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the observed frequencies are far too low to originate from a keplerian motion at the inner edge of the accretion disk ( innermost stable orbit ) .",
    "we further note that for a normal standard disk , viscous timescales are too long ( @xmath123 s ) to explain the high frequencies and seem to have a very low dependency on accretion rate ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "it may well be that the break frequency is indeed associated with a keplerian motion .",
    "however , as we have argued , the corresponding radius does not seem to be directly associated with the inner edge of the standard disk .",
    "maybe this radius only reaches the innermost radii for highly accreting objects like z - sources with their lower khz qpo .",
    "we have seen that nss with measured @xmath3 seem to follow the suggested correlation . at higher accretion rate",
    "the z - sources have lower frequencies than expected .",
    "this discrepancy may arise from the slightly larger size of the ns with its boundary layer compared to a bh with similar mass . while increasing the accretion rate , the emitting region can not move inwards as expected as it is stopped by the boundary layer .",
    "this may also be the reason for the relatively low dno frequencies of strongly accreting white dwarfs ( see fig .",
    "[ fiwdbreakup ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the variability plane found in agn and soft - state xrbs ( @xmath14 ) can be extended to hard - state bh xrbs and weakly accreting nss . for hard - state objects the frequency of the lower high - frequency lorentzian @xmath125 corresponds to the high - frequency break in agn and soft - state xrbs .",
    "for white dwarfs , the situation seems to be more complicated as we need to correct of the wd radius .",
    "while some dwarf novae seem to lie near the correlation ( within the large uncertainties ) , strongly accreting nova - like systems do not seem to follow the correlation as the frequencies would otherwise exceed the breakup frequency of the wd . in case that the high - break frequency in the psd is related to a keplerian orbit around the black hole , we find that this radius in gravitational radii depends on the accretion rate as @xmath126 .",
    "however , the orbit corresponding to the high break is unlikely directly related to the radius where the standard optically thick disk turns into an optically thin inefficient accretion flow .",
