    "the phenomenon of axial anomaly @xcite is widely known for its manifestation in two - photon decays of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the dispersive approach to axial anomaly @xcite turns out to be a useful tool for exploration of the processes , which involve virtual photons also , like the photon - meson transitions @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the axial anomaly is associated with the vva triangle graph amplitude , which involves two vector currents with momenta @xmath1 and one axial current with momentum @xmath2 :    @xmath3    this amplitude can be decomposed into the six tensor structures ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the scalar factors , constrained by current conservation and bose symmetry . in what follows ,",
    "we consider the case with one virtual photon ( @xmath7 ) and one real photon ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the axial anomaly , considered in the dispersive approach , leads to an anomaly sum rule ( asr ) @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a number of colors , @xmath12 is a quark mass and @xmath13 are the charge factors of components of the axial currents @xmath14 . for the isovector ( @xmath15 ) and octet ( @xmath16 ) components of axial current    @xmath17",
    "the asr ( [ asr ] ) has an important property ",
    "both perturbative and nonperturbative corrections to the integral are absent because of the adler - bardeen theorem and the t hooft s principle .    in the case of _",
    "isovector channel _ , saturating the l.h.s .",
    "of the three - point correlation function ( [ vva ] ) with the resonances , singling out the first contribution , given by the pion , and collecting all the other states into the continuum contribution @xmath18 , we get the asr in a form ( in what follows we take @xmath19 ) :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a continuum threshold , and the general definitions of the decay constants @xmath22 ( @xmath23 mev ) and the transition form factors ( tffs ) of the reactions @xmath24 are @xmath25    if we employ the one - loop expression for the spectral density @xcite @xmath26 from the eq .",
    "( [ qhd3 ] ) we get @xcite @xmath27    in the qcd factorization approach the expression of the tff is given in terms of the convolution of a hard scattering kernel and a soft pion distribution amplitude ( da ) @xmath28 ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , at @xmath29 , where the pion da evolves to its asymptotic form @xmath30 and the pion tff acquires its asymptotic value @xcite @xmath31 , the continuum threshold @xmath21 can be determined from ( [ f3 m ] ) , @xmath32 gev@xmath33 and then ( [ f3 m ] ) reproduces a well - known brodsky - lepage interpolation formula @xcite .    when compared to the experimental data on pion tff , the equation ( [ f3 m ] )",
    "gives a fairly good description of the data of cello @xcite , cleo @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations , while the data of babar collaboration @xcite are described much worse ( see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the babar data indicate a log - like growth , and in order to describe them well , one needs to consider a possibility of the correction . as we mentioned above , the integral in the asr",
    "does not have any corrections , but the spectral density @xmath34 can acquire corrections , and therefore the continuum and the pion contributions can have corrections as well .",
    "the exactness of the asr results in an interesting interplay between corrections to the continuum and pion : they should cancel each other to preserve the asr , @xmath35 .",
    "the form of the correction is not yet known ( the origins of such a correction should be essentially nonperturbative , see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can propose the form of the correction , relying on general properties of asr : it should vanish at @xmath36 ( the continuum contribution vanishes ) , at @xmath37 ( the full integral has no corrections ) , at @xmath29 ( the perturbative theory works at large @xmath38 ) and at @xmath39 ( anomaly perfectly describes pion decay width ) . supposing the correction contains rational functions and logarithms of @xmath38 , the simplest form of the correction satisfying those limits results @xcite in    @xmath40,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "this kind of correction can not appear in ( a local ) ope and should be attributed , possibly , to instantons or short strings .",
    "note also , that this correction implies that the pion distribution amplitude @xmath28 does not vanish at @xmath43 and violates the factorization ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the fit of the tff ( [ corr3f ] ) to the combined cello+cleo+babar data gives @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the plot of @xmath46 for these parameters is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] as a solid line .",
    "the tff ( [ corr3f ] ) with these parameters @xmath47 describes well also the combined cello+cleo+belle data with @xmath48 . on the other hand , the tff without correction ( [ f3 m ] ) ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) ) gives @xmath49 and @xmath50 for cello+cleo+babar and cello+cleo+belle data sets respectively .",
    "we can conclude , that although the babar data favour the log - like correction , the newly released belle data neither confirm , nor exclude the possibility of this correction .    )",
    "( dashed line ) and ( [ corr3f ] ) ( solid line ) compared with experimental data , width=340 ]    it is interesting to consider in the same way the asr in the _ octet channel_. here we should take into account the first two contributions , which are given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 mesons .",
    "then the asr in the octet channel @xcite is ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is a continuum threshold , which can be determined from the large-@xmath38 limit of ( [ asr8 ] ) and the pqcd predicted expression for the @xmath55 tffs : @xmath56).\\ ] ]    naturally , if the log - like correction is present in the isovector channel , it should reveal itself in the octet channel too .",

    "( [ asr8 ] ) , ( [ asr8inf ] ) and ( [ asr8-corr ] ) contain the decay constants @xmath58 , which are usually analyzed basing on different mixing schemes or in a scheme independent way ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . for the purposes of numerical analysis",
    ", we employ the decay constants , obtained in a scheme - independent way in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath59 .",

    "( [ asr8 ] ) gives @xmath62 ( dashed line ) . at the same time , if the parameters are taken the same as for the pion case @xmath63 , we get @xmath64 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "we see that the current precision of the experimental data on @xmath55 tffs can accommodate the log - like correction in the octet channel , although does not require it .",
    "the current experimental data for the pion transition form factor in the range of @xmath65 available from babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations manifest different tendencies .",
    "the babar data @xcite show an excess over the asymptotic value of the transition form factor , requiring a log - like correction , and therefore violating the qcd factorization and favouring the flat - like ( not vanishing at the edges ) pion distribution amplitude .",
    "the more recent belle data @xcite do not manifest that striking behaviour and are more or less consistent with the brodsky - lepage interpolation formula .",
    "the analysis for the octet channel of the asr , based on the babar data on @xmath51 and @xmath52 tffs @xcite , shows the possibility to accommodate such correction , but does not require it .",
