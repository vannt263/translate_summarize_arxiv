    "one of the simplest model describing correlation effects in narrow energy bands is the hubbard model  @xcite . the model hamiltonian contains two energy parameters : the matrix element @xmath0 being the hopping integral of an electron from one site to another ( @xmath0 is not dependent on occupation of sites involved in the hopping process ) and the parameter @xmath1 being the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion of two electrons of the opposite spins .",
    "this model is studied intensively ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "theoretical analyses , on the one hand , and available experimental data , on the other hand , point out the necessity of the hubbard model generalization by taking into account correlated hopping .",
    "this necessity is caused by two reasons .",
    "firstly , theoretical analyses  @xcite point out the inapplicability of the hubbard model for the description of real strongly correlated electron systems , in some compounds ( e.g. see the estimation in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) the matrix element of electron - electron interaction describing correlated hopping is the same order that the hopping integral or on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "secondly , using the concept of correlated hopping and caused by it the electron - hole asymmetry we can interpret the peculiarities of some physical properties of narrow - band materials  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "now two ways are commonly used to generalize the single - band hubbard model by taking into account correlated hopping .",
    "one of them has been proposed in ref .",
    "hirsch showed that in contrast to the hopping integral of the hubbard model ( which is not dependent on occupation of sites involved in the hopping process ) this parameter of a generalized hubbard model had to depend on occupation of sites involved in the hopping process .",
    "hamiltonian of the generalized in such a way hubbard model is written as @xmath2    in recent few years hamiltonian ( [ g_ham ] ) is widely used to study metal - insulator transition in narrow energy bands @xcite-@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the necessity of the hubbard model generalization by taking into account the matrix element of electron - electron interaction describing intersite hoppings of electrons had been pointed out .",
    "the hamiltonian of the generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the chemical potential , @xmath5 is the hubbard operator  @xcite ; @xmath6 denotes the state of site , which is not occupied by an electron ( hole ) , @xmath7 denotes the state of singly occupied ( by an electron with spin @xmath8 ) @xmath9-site , @xmath10 denotes the state of doubly occupied ( by two electrons with the opposite spins ) @xmath9-site ( doublon ) .",
    "@xmath11 is the effective hopping integral of electrons between nearest - neighbor sites of lattice , @xmath12 is the electron concentration , @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath15 is the wannier function , @xmath16 the prime at the sums signifies that @xmath17 .    in the model described by hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) an electron hopping from one site to another",
    "is correlated both by the occupation of the sites involved in the hopping process ( with the hopping integral @xmath18 ) and the occupation of the nearest - neighbor sites ( with the hopping integral @xmath19 ) which we take into account in the hartree - fock approximation ( eq .",
    "( [ c_d_h ] ) ) .",
    "the peculiarity of model  ( [ ham ] ) is the concentration dependence of the hopping integral @xmath20 in contrast to similar models .",
    "below we shall consider the half - filling case , so let us introduce the following notations : @xmath21 .",
    "properties of generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping , in particular metal - insulator transition ( mit ) has been studied in a number of recent works  @xcite-@xcite-@xcite . at half - filling and @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 )",

    "one of the step to solve this task is recent papers @xcite-@xcite where criteria of mit , ground state energy , concentration of doubly occupied sites have been found . in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite the authors have obtained the following criterion of mit : @xmath30 in agreement with the mott s general physical ideas  @xcite . by means of the slave bosons method  @xcite",
    "it has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite that mit occurs at @xmath31 ; however here there is a problem of discrepancy of this result with the exact mit criterion  ( [ exact_cr ] ) .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a further study of properties generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping at half - filling , in particular investigation of the model chemical potential in the region of metal - insulator transition .",
    "the single - particle green function in terms of the hubbard operators reads as @xmath32 the green function @xmath33 is given by the equation @xmath34|x_{p'}^{\\sigma 0}\\rangle\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\langle\\langle\\left[x_p^{0\\sigma } , h'_1\\right]|x_{p'}^{\\sigma 0}\\rangle \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35=ab - ba$ ] . using a variant  @xcite of the generalized mean - field approximation  @xcite",
