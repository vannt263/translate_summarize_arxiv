    "the higgs sector of the electroweak theory attracts much attention because of its connection with the cornerstones of the theory .",
    "the search for higgs scalars is included in most of the experimental programs of the newcoming and acting accelerators  @xcite .",
    "the higgs particles are suggested to be found in the decays of different particles ( @xmath2 bosons , heavy quarkoniums etc . ) as well as in photon - photon interactions and gluon - gluon fusion . in connection with that , let us mention non - so - long - ago attempts to explain anomalous events seen at _ sps _ as the manifestation of the bound state of two higgs bosons , i.  e. of higgsonium  @xcite-@xcite or that of the bound state of vector boson  @xcite in accordance with the veltman paper , ref .",
    "nowadays , even after clarifying the experimental situation with these anomalous events , the interest in higgsonium has still the rights for existence at least from the viewpoint of preparedness to new unexpected news from the experiment .",
    "the previous investigations of the problem of existence of two - higgs bound states were based on the born approximation of their interaction amplitude  @xcite-@xcite . in the present paper we present the results of our calculation of the amplitude of higgs - higgs interaction up to the fourth order in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) of weinberg , salam and glashow with one higgs doublet .",
    "this problem is also of present interest since there is some relations with the idea that gauge vector bosons could originate from a strong interacting scalar sector of the electroweak theory  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude obtained in this paper could also be useful for the consideration of the problem of the unitarity limit ( e. g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , information on the behaviour of the higgs coupling constants at mass scale @xmath3 would be also of interest .",
    "these are the reasons why we start a more complete study of the problem of higgs - higgs interaction . to reduce the volume of the article we shall use the standard notation used in  @xcite , dimensional regularization and the renormalization scheme on the mass shell , which is analogous to that suggested in  @xcite .",
    "we also choose the unitary gauge ( @xmath4 , to avoid ghosts ) and the parameters recommended by the trieste conference  @xcite , namely ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the higgs sector of the lagrangian of the sm with one higgs field has the following form , e.  g.  @xcite : . ]",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electron charge , @xmath8 is the higgs mass , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the masses of the vector bosons , @xmath11 are the fermion masses , @xmath12 .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the expressions for the self - energy and vertex parts ( see also calculations in details in  @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the calculation of the total higgs - higgs amplitude will be presented in section 3 .",
    "the appendix contains the definitions of some integrals met in calculations . their connections with the integrals calculated in  @xcite",
    "is given .",
    "+ the traces of @xmath13- matrices in an @xmath14-dimensional space are @xmath15 where @xmath16 in the present work we use @xmath17 , @xmath14 is the dimension of the space in the dimensional regularization ."
