    "with the evidence for neutrino masses and mixings from solar and atmospheric neutrino data getting more and more firm , the nature of new physics that could explain the observations is under a great deal of scrutiny @xcite .",
    "there are several issues that need to be understood , notably ( a ) the smallness of neutrino masses , and ( b ) the origin of the large atmospheric neutrino as well as the solar neutrino mixing angles , the latter being favored@xcite by the combined solar neutrino results@xcite including the recent sno neutral current data @xcite .",
    "seesaw mechanism@xcite provides one of the simplest ways to understand the small neutrino masses .",
    "it assumes the existence of a set of three right  handed neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) that have masses at the scale @xmath6 corresponding to a new ( local ) @xmath7 symmetry of weak interactions .",
    "atmospheric neutrino observations suggest that the scale @xmath6 is much lower than the planck scale , leading to a new threshold inferred solely from experiments . at low energies , these heavy right  handed neutrinos induce operators of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the dirac yukawa coupling matrix connecting the @xmath0 with the left - handed neutrinos ( @xmath10 ) and the standard model ( sm ) higgs doublet @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the lepton doublet which contains @xmath10 .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , these operators induce masses for the light @xmath10 of order @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath6 is much larger than the weak scale @xmath14 , the induced @xmath10 masses will be extremely small compared to all other masses of the sm fermions .",
    "present neutrino oscillation data suggests a scale @xmath15 gev .",
    "the precise seesaw formula for the light neutrino mass matrix with three generations is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath18 is the @xmath0 majorana matrix .",
    "the neutrino mixing angles in such schemes would arise as a joint effect from two sources : ( i ) mixings among the right  handed neutrinos present in @xmath19 and ( ii ) mixings among different generations present in the dirac mass matrix @xmath17 .",
    "the ( physical ) neutrino oscillation angles will also receive contributions from mixings among the charged leptons .",
    "the neutrino flavor mixings induced by the seesaw mechanism ( as needed by oscillation data ) can lead to lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) effects .",
    "however , within the sm extended minimally to accommodate the seesaw mechanism , such effects are extremely small in any process other than neutrino oscillation itself , owing to a power suppression factor @xmath20 , as required by the decoupling theorem .",
    "this situation is drastically different if there is low energy supersymmetry .",
    "the power suppression then becomes @xmath21 which is very much weaker and can lead to observable lfv effects at low energies , as noted in a number of papers@xcite .",
    "the main difference is that with low energy susy , lepton flavor violation can be induced in the slepton sector , which can then be transferred to the leptons suppressed only by a factor @xmath21 .",
    "the way this comes about is as follows .",
    "consider the minimal @xmath22 supergravity ( msugra ) models @xcite . at the fundamental scale @xmath23 where",
    "susy breaking is communicated to the sm sector , all the soft susy breaking scalar masses are taken to be universal , and the trilinear @xmath24matrices are taken to be proportional to the respective yukawa matrices .",
    "thus , at the planck scale , there is no flavor violation anywhere except in the yukawa couplings and susy  preserving mass terms in the superpotential .",
    "now , the right  handed neutrinos have masses of order @xmath6 which is much lower than @xmath23 , as inferred from atmospheric neutrino data . in the momentum regime @xmath25 where the @xmath0 fields are active",
    ", the soft masses of the sleptons will feel the effects of lfv in the neutrino yukawa sector through the renormalization group evolution . at the scale @xmath6 , the slepton mass matrix is no longer universal , and this non - universality will remain down to the weak scale .",
    "this lfv in the slepton sector is subsequently transferred to the leptons through one  loop diagrams involving the exchange of gauginos .",
    "it should be noted that in the absence of neutrino masses , there is only one leptonic yukawa matrix , @xmath26 for the charged leptons , which can be diagonalized at @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath26 will remain diagonal to the weak scale , and would not induce any flavor violation in the slepton sector in msugra models .",
    "the experimental evidence for neutrino oscillation is thus a strong indicator that there might very well be lepton flavor violation , assuming the validity of low energy susy .",
    "searches for lfv processes such as @xmath27 and/or @xmath28 can therefore be an important source of information on the @xmath0 mixings in @xmath18 and/or family mixings in @xmath17 .",
    "( there are some exceptional circumstances , which we point out later in this section . )",
    "it is possible to classify the seesaw models into two classes depending on the way the @xmath0 gets its majorana mass @xmath18 . in one case",
    ", @xmath18 arises from renormalizable yukawa couplings involving a @xmath1 higgs field @xmath29 through the superpotential terms @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the majorana yukawa coupling matrix , @xmath32 is the dirac yukawa matrix and we use the standard notation appropriate for supersymmetry with @xmath33 being the conjugate of @xmath0 . in the second class of models ,",
    "the matrix @xmath18 is either put in `` by hand '' as a bare mass term in the lagrangian ( such terms are super - renormalizable ) , or arises from non - renormalizable operators involving a @xmath34 higgs boson @xmath35 via the couplings @xmath36 . in models of the second class , the flavor violating slepton mixings can arise ( assuming msugra ) only from the dirac yukawa couplings of the neutrinos , @xmath32 . on the other hand , in the first class , which is the main focus of this paper , lfv can arise from both the dirac yukawa coupling @xmath32 as well as the majorana yukawa coupling @xmath31 .    for the purpose of the present paper",
    ", we will call the two lepton flavor violation alternatives as lfv in the majorana case and lfv in the dirac case .",
    "the simplest example of models with renormalizable majorana yukawa couplings is provided by the minimal ( susy ) extension of the sm with a gauged @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "bare masses for the @xmath0 are then forbidden by @xmath7 gauge invariance . if the higgs sector contains a @xmath1 field @xmath29 , the yukawa coupling @xmath37 as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) will be allowed which will induce @xmath18 of order @xmath38 .",
    "( if instead of @xmath29 , a @xmath34 higgs field @xmath35 is used , @xmath18 can arise from a non - renormalizable coupling @xmath39 .",
    "this belongs to the second class .",
    ") there are interesting extensions of this class of models with renormalizable majorana couplings , such as so(10 ) with a * 126 * higgs field@xcite or left - right symmetric model with a triplet higgs field . in these models the majorana yukawa couplings may play a dominant role in generating the required neutrino mixings .",
    "the role of the dirac yukawa coupling @xmath32 for lfv may be subleading and may even be negligible . to be concrete , we shall assume in our analysis that the matrix @xmath32 is diagonal in a basis where the charged lepton yukawa matrix @xmath26 is also diagonal . for numerical purposes we shall further assume that @xmath32 and @xmath26 are proportional ,",
    "a situation realized naturally if the gauge symmetry is left - right symmetric .",
    "the neutrino mixings will all arise from the majorana coupling matrix @xmath31 , which will be determined ( upto an overall scale factor ) from neutrino oscillation data .",
    "the proportionality assumption @xmath40 is not crucial to our main conclusions on lfv effects related to @xmath18 , but it greatly simplifies the presentation of our results .",
    "this assumption may be viewed as analogous to the assumption often made in the case of dirac lfv models that the super - renormalizable majorana mass matrix @xmath18 is proportional to an identity matrix .      in an earlier paper @xcite",
    "we have presented results of our preliminary investigations on lfv involving the majorana yukawa matrix @xmath31 , assuming proportionality of @xmath32 and @xmath26 .",
    "( we called this relation up  down unification . ) there we studied a general class of susy breaking models and did not adhere to msugra .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite was carried out in the context of left ",
    "right symmetric gauge theories with an enhanced gauge structure .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , in this paper we analyze lfv effects induced by the @xmath31 matrix within msugra models .",
    "this means that the only source of lepton flavor violation is in the neutrino yukawa sector .",
    "significant lfv effects are found even in this minimal scenario . as explained in sec .",
    "ii.c , a novel way of fitting the low energy neutrino oscillation data has the effect of enhancing the lfv in this minimal scheme .",
    "we also use a simplified gauge structure involving only an extra @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "even this symmetry is not essential , the crucial ingredient is the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath31 of eq .",
    "thus the models studied here are more minimal compared to the left - right models and are likely to be the low energy limits of a wider class of unified models .",
    "our main result is that lfv effects associated with the majorana yukawa coupling @xmath31 are in the range accessible to forthcoming experiments for a large range of mssm parameters consistent with constraints from dark matter , the higgs boson mass and direct experimental search for supersymmetry .",
    "we also point out that the detailed dependence of the branching ratios in processes such as @xmath41 and @xmath3 on the mssm parameters is different in this class of models compared to the case of flavor violation associated with the dirac yukawa coupling @xmath32 . with",
    "some information of the mssm parameters , measurements of these radiative decays will enable one to pin down the nature of interactions that give rise to the right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "obviously , this will have a profound impact on our understanding of the neutrino sector and can shed light on the origin of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "it may be worth pointing out that there are other experimental predictions that may help to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "for instance , two of us have recently pointed out that the dirac lfv models can lead to an observable signal in the baryon number non - conserving process neutron - anti - neutron oscillation@xcite whereas in the majorana lfv case , the n-@xmath42 oscillation is unobservable .",
    "there is one caveat in the foregoing discussions that should be mentioned .",
    "it applies equally well to the dirac and majorana lfv alternatives . in a special class of seesaw schemes it is possible that no lepton flavor violation shows up in the next round of experiments without contradicting the current neutrino oscillation data even in the presence of low energy susy .",
    "while we feel that such situations would be non  generic , it should be born in mind , nevertheless . in the dirac lfv alternative",
    "it occurs as follows .",
    "it is conceivable that all the flavor mixings arise from the mass matrix @xmath18 and that @xmath32 is diagonal .",
    "flavor violation in the bare mass parameter ( or non - renormalizable term ) @xmath18 is not transmitted to the slepton sector via the rge , implying highly suppressed lfv effects .",
    "one can easily fit all the neutrino oscillation data via the mixings present in @xmath18 .",
    "it is also possible that the scale @xmath18 is much below @xmath43 gev , in which case the elements of @xmath32 will be much smaller than unity so as to fit the neutrino data , again suppressing lfv effects .",
    "similarly , in the majorana lfv alternative , it might so happen that the elements of @xmath31 are very small , compensated by a higher value of @xmath6 so that @xmath18 is unchanged , or that the elements of @xmath32 are small .",
    "such a scenario will suppress lepton flavor violation .",
    "a null result in the rare lepton decay searches would point to a situation in which either of these two situations could be operative and we will have no way to tell which operators are inducing the @xmath0 masses . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is a positive signal in the rare decays , our results will help in probing the origin of @xmath18 .",
    "it appears to us natural to have at least the third family yukawa coupling in @xmath32 of order one ( analogous to the top quark yukawa coupling being of order one ) and similarly at least one element of @xmath31 ( @xmath44 ) to be of order one .",
    "observable lfv effects follow in this case , which is what we analyze .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the basic model and the relevant renormalization group equations ( rge ) that will be used in getting the slepton mixings and thus the lepton flavor violating rates for the case of majorana lfv . here",
    "we also present analytic approximations to the lfv effects by integrating the rge .",
    "these expressions , while only approximate , are useful in gauging the significance of lfv in the majorana case as well as in comparing it with the case of dirac lfv . in section",
    "ii.a we present the relevant expressions for obtaining the @xmath31 matrix by inverting the seesaw formula . in ii.b",
    "this information is used to compare analytically the predictions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 branching ratios in the two cases . in section",
    "ii.c we present a convenient way to parametrize the majorana yukawa matrix @xmath31 that can be compared directly against low energy neutrino oscillation data on the one hand and lfv effects on the other .",
    "section iii is devoted to our exact numerical results for lfv effects in the case of majorana as well as dirac yukawa couplings .",
    "in iii.a we present our numerical fits to the neutrino parameters , iii.b has our results for the branching ratios @xmath41 and @xmath45 as well as the ratio of the two branching ratios .",
    "section iv has our conclusions .",
    "in order to illustrate in detail the source of lfv for the case of majorana yukawa couplings generating the @xmath0 mass matrix ( the majorana lfv alternative ) , we work with a simple extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model that accommodates the seesaw mechanism . it is based on the weak gauge group @xmath46 with fermions assigned as follows : @xmath47 .",
    "this is the simplest extension of the weak interaction sector that predicts the existence of the @xmath0 from gauge anomaly cancellations conditions and thus to small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the higgs superfields are @xmath48 .",
    "the superpotential for this theory is : @xmath49 here all the yukawa couplings are @xmath50 matrices ; @xmath51 is a singlet field introduced to help facilitate the breaking of @xmath52 down to @xmath53 in the susy limit .",
    "one identifies the sm hypercharge as @xmath54 .",
    "this superpotential gives equal vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) to @xmath55 .",
    "the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath31 will induce large mass for the @xmath33 field , leading to the seesaw mechanism .",
    "this model should be contrasted with the commonly discussed case in the literature where the heavy @xmath0 masses are either put in by hand or arise from a non - renormalizable term in the superpotential .    in order to study flavor violation",
    ", we will make the simplifying assumption that both @xmath9 and @xmath26 are diagonal at the planck scale ; therefore all neutrino mixings arise from the general flavor structure of the majorana yukawa couplings @xmath56 .",
    "then from the approximate bi - maximal pattern for neutrino mixings deduced from oscillation data , we can obtain @xmath56 for different patterns of neutrino masses .",
    "since the model is supersymmetric , the flavor violation present in @xmath56 will induce processes such as @xmath57 and @xmath28 decays .",
    "we investigate these predictions using simple analytic approximations in this section .",

    "since we also want to identify the lightest neutralino ( lsp ) as the dark matter in the universe , the relic abundance puts another constraint that the second lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) , the right  handed stau in our case , should be nearly degenerate with the lsp to within about 20 - 30 gev .",
    "this condition can be satisfied if @xmath84 is obeyed , which we shall adopt .",
    "take for example a relatively light susy spectrum with @xmath85 gev and @xmath86 .",
