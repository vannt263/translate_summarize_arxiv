    "one can list investigations on the quantum gravity  @xcite , lattice dislocations of the solid - state crystals , complex networks  @xcite such as neural systems and complicated web connections .",
    "the focus of the present analysis lies in classical lattice spin models , for which the thermal property is influenced by the non - flatness of the underlying lattice . as typical examples , phase transitions on regular two - dimensional hyperbolic lattices",
    "have been studied for the ising model  @xcite , the @xmath4-state clock models  @xcite , the @xmath5-model  @xcite , and the frustrated @xmath6-@xmath7 ising model  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the hyperbolic lattices are constructed by means of the tessellation of regular polygons with @xmath8 sides , where the coordination number , @xmath4 , satisfies the hyperbolic condition @xmath9 .",
    "such uniform hyperbolic lattices are conventionally called the @xmath10 lattice , and their hausdorff dimension is infinite  @xcite .",
    "the observed phase transitions in numerical studies qualitatively agree with the mean - field approximation .",
    "in particular , the second - order phase transition with the landau mean - field universality has been observed for the ising model  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the mean - field behavior has not been clarified yet .",
    "a key feature of the phase transitions on the hyperbolic @xmath10 lattices is that the correlation length remains finite even at the transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "the fact suggests the presence of an inherent length in each @xmath10 lattice , the length which violates the realization of the scale invariance at criticality .",
    "one can conjecture that the length is related to the curvature radius @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gaussian curvature on a hyperbolic plane . as long as we observe @xmath10 lattices only ,",
    "it is non - trivial to confirm this conjecture , since the radius @xmath13 is of the order of the lattice constant even on the @xmath14 lattice , which is less curved than the cases with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in this article",
    "we propose a way to construct a series of two - dimensional lattices formed by tessellation of the triangles ( @xmath15 ) , where the absolute value of the _ averaged _ curvature @xmath12 is smaller than the @xmath14 lattice .",
    "such a slightly curved lattice is obtained by distributing exceptional lattice sites of the coordination number seven within the triangular lattice in such manner that the typical distance between nearest exceptional sites is proportional to an integer parameter @xmath0 . under such construction ,",
    "the corresponding curvature @xmath12 is asymptotically proportional to @xmath17 , and the radius @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate thermodynamic properties of the ising model on the series of weakly curved lattices by means of the corner transfer matrix renormalization group ( ctmrg ) method  @xcite , which is based on baxter s corner transfer matrix ( ctm ) scheme  @xcite . as a quantity that captures the length scale , we focus on the entanglement entropy at the transition temperature . as we show in the following , the entropy scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the central charge of the ising model .",

    "iii we derive thermodynamic quantities by means of the ctmrg method , which is modified for the series of the lattices .",
