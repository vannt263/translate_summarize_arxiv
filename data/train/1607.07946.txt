    "the origin of exciton dissociation at the donor - accepter ( da ) interface is one of the most important problems in the field of organic solar cells .",
    "a key to solve the problem is the charge transfer exciton ( cte ) .",
    "although several models have been proposed to explain the cte dissociation @xcite , there is no consensus on what physics is mainly involved .",
    "the origins derived from the previous models @xcite are listed in table [ tab : previous ] ; dark dipoles @xcite , disorder @xcite , carrier delocalization @xcite , and light effective mass @xcite , and so forth . in recent years , the entropy effect on the cte dissociation at the da interface @xcite has been a hot topic .",
    "recent experiments seem to support this view @xcite .",
    "however , the entropy effect has not been studied in terms of the quantum mechanical description where both the electron and the hole are treated by delocalized carriers .    in order to emphasize the importance of the delocalized carrier treatment ( quantum mechanical description ) for the cte dissociation , it is useful to introduce the models developed so far . in earliest study ,",

    "the present work also supports this conclusion .",
    "it has been suggested that the disorder can assist the cte dissociation @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been also reported that the disorder makes the charge transfer ineffective @xcite . to investigate the disorder effect in the present model",

    "( [ eq : rand_pot ] ) and ( [ eq : rand_hop ] ) , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath155 decreases by about @xmath39 due to the presence of the disorder , while that of @xmath156 is almost unchanged [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : free_energy](a ) ] . since the free energy difference between them at @xmath101 is large , the transition temperature becomes large ( @xmath1570.3 ) .",
    "this indicates that the disorder may not assist the cte dissociation .",
    "it may be because the disorder given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rand_pot ] ) and ( [ eq : rand_hop ] ) confines the carrier distribution to the sites just near the da interface , which lowers the free energy due to the attractive coulomb interaction .",
    "unless we consider different types of disorder , we would not observe the decrease in the @xmath94 .",
    "the present work supports the idea of the entropy - driven cte dissociation @xcite .",
    "the combination with the idea of carrier delocalization @xcite is crucial .",
    "the important findings in this work are ( i ) the existence of a critical temperature @xmath94 , below and above which the localization and delocalization of charge carriers are observed , respectively , and ( ii ) the approximate formula for determining @xmath94 given by eq .",

    "@xcite , while the latter is useful to predict the magnitude of @xmath94 theoretically .",

    "we set @xmath1580.5 ev by using @xmath159 ( @xmath160 is the dielectric constant of vacuum ) and the equilibrium molecule - molecule distance @xmath161 nm of c@xmath1 crystals .",
    "the hopping parameter at the da interface is set to @xmath162 , by assuming that the single - particle band width is a few hundred mev .",
    "the height of the barrier potential is set to @xmath163 , so that the cte ( not the frenkel exciton ) is formed at @xmath101 .",
    "then , the value of @xmath1640.27 corresponds to @xmath165160 k. the magnitude of this temperature is in agreement with the temperature , at which the free carrier density starts to increase , as observed in c@xmath1-related organic solar cells @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the magnitude of the cte binding energy @xmath166 can also be estimated from the eh dos . assuming that the continuum states start from @xmath167 at lower @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](a ) , the @xmath168th cte binding energy is @xmath169 . for example , @xmath170 0.26 ev , which is an order of magnitude higher than thermal energy at room temperature , but is consistent with experimental observations @xcite .    we do not exclude the possibility that the cte dissociation occurs even when the lattice temperature @xmath171 is initially below @xmath94 . if the excess energy from the offset in energy levels at the da interface @xcite excites the phonon modes and enhance the phonon temperature with some delay time , the cte dissociation can occur .",
    "a possible scenario is as follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scenario ] ) :    1 .",
    "the exciton is initially created at the donor region by photon absorption .",
    "the electron transfer occurs at the da interface , yielding the cte formation .",
    "3 .   the excess energy created by the cte formation ( i.e. , the energy difference between the donor lumo and acceptor lumo ) excites phonons at the interface and disturbs the cold phonon distribution initially at @xmath171 .",
    "4 .   through the phonon - phonon and phonon - electron scatterings , the phonon modes will obey the bose distribution function with temperature @xmath172 higher than @xmath171 after the phonon thermalization time .",
    "when @xmath172 is larger than @xmath94 , the cte can dissociate .",
    "if this scenario holds , the magnitude of @xmath172 gradually increases with time .",
    "then , the cte energy also increases with time , as expected by the @xmath0-dependent @xmath173 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eeh](a ) .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to the experimental observations , where the cte spontaneously climbs up the coulomb potential at the pentacene - vacuum interface @xcite . for deeper understanding",
    ", it is necessarily to study the time - dependence of the interface phonon temperature @xmath172 .",
    "this may be studied in the framework of the nonequilibrium theory of phonons @xcite .",
    "the estimation of @xmath94 in realistic systems @xcite would be important in understanding the difference of the cte properties in organic solar cells .",
    "we propose a method how to calculate each term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : formula ] ) .",
    "first , @xmath73 is equivalent to the total energy of the system at zero @xmath0 and can be calculated accurately by using the dft approach and assuming that one electron is excited into an unoccupied state leaving a hole behind .",
    "second , @xmath124 may be calculated in the framework of the finite-@xmath0 dft by ignoring the attractive interaction between an electron and a hole .",
    "finally , @xmath128 , defined as @xmath174 in the limit of @xmath175 , is estimated by calculating the attractive coulomb interaction energy between the electron and hole .",
    "such an eh pair density is obtained by the computation of @xmath176 .",
    "we also emphasize the finite-@xmath0 effect on the excitonic properties .",
    "the exciton is usually described within many - body perturbation theory or time - dependent dft @xcite .",
    "recently , the cte has been studied in such a first - principles context @xcite .",
    "the extension to the @xmath0-dependent bethe - salpeter or time - dependent kohn - sham equations and their solutions would give an accurate estimation of the cte binding energy and predict the localization - delocalization transition or the free energy anomaly mentioned in the present work .",
    "in the present tb model , we assumed that the dielectric constant is uniform across the da interface [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vele ] ) and ( [ eq : vhole ] ) ]",
    ". however , it may be natural to consider that the bonding arrangement between molecules is not uniform near the da interface . in this case , the dielectric constant varies locally @xcite .",
    "as a first approximation , the coulomb interaction between the electron at @xmath177 and the hole at @xmath178 can be expressed as @xmath179 where @xmath180 with @xmath181 is the local dielectric constant at the site @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the local dielectric constant [ the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : local ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vele ] ) and ( [ eq : vhole ] ) ] on the cte dissociation .",
    "we have derived the @xmath0-dependent tb model for a eh pair at the da interface , which enabled us to study the entropy as well as the carrier delocalization effect on the cte dissociation .",
    "our numerical calculations have revealed that there exists the localization - delocalization transition at a critical temperature @xmath94 , above which the cte dissociates .",
    "this is related to the anomaly of the free energy @xmath33 . below and above @xmath94 , @xmath33",
    "is determined by the internal energy and the entropic energy , respectively .",
    "the transition can be observed only when the carrier delocalization treatment is employed .",
    "thus , the cte dissociation has been successfully explained by a combination of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "analysis of the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath33 has enabled us to derive the useful relation for @xmath94 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : formula ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath94 and the cte binding energy estimated were in agreement with the experimental data .",

    "the present work emphasized the importance of the combined effect of both the entropy ( finite-@xmath0 ) and the carrier delocalization .",
    "the present study agrees with the notion that the light effective mass is effective in the cte dissociation , but disagrees with the notion that the disorder effect is important .",
