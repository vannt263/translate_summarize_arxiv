    "in this paper , we explore a generic approach to interaction effects in diffusive and/or chaotic quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime . to set the stage ,",
    "we describe in this introduction some previous work , and discuss the motivation of our own investigation .",
    "electron transport in quantum dots that are strongly coupled to leads ( open dots ) has been successfully described within a single  particle framework .",
    "electron interactions affect the dephasing rate of the electrons at finite temperature , but otherwise electrons in the vicinity of the fermi energy can be described as non  interacting quasi  particles .",
    "the single  particle dynamics in the dot can be affected by disorder or by the dot s boundaries . in a disordered dot , the electron moves diffusively .",
    "if the disorder is weak , the statistical fluctuations of the single  electron spectrum and wave functions can be described by random  matrix theory ( rmt).@xcite similarly , in a ballistic dot with irregular boundaries , the classical dynamics are mostly chaotic and the statistical quantal fluctuations also follow rmt . in such diffusive and/or chaotic open dots ,",
    "the conductance exhibits `` random '' but reproducible fluctuations versus , e.g. , gate voltage or magnetic field that can be successfully described by rmt.@xcite    the situation changes as the coupling of the dot to the leads is reduced and the dot becomes almost isolated .",
    "the charge on the dot becomes quantized , the conductance as a function of gate voltage displays sharp peaks ( the coulomb blockade resonances ) , and the coulomb interaction between electrons becomes important.@xcite in this coulomb blockade regime , the simplest model for a quantum dot is the constant interaction ( ci ) model .",
    "the interaction is modeled by the classical charging energy of a system with capacitance @xmath0 . for a fixed number of electrons @xmath1 on the dot ,",
    "the interaction of this model is constant , and the model essentially reduces to a single  particle model . while certain statistical properties of the conductance peak heights can be described within the ci plus rmt model,@xcite other observables , most notably the distribution of the distance between successive conductance peaks ( a distance known as the peak spacing ) , deviate significantly from the predictions of the ci plus rmt model.@xcite these deviations have been understood , at least qualitatively , to follow from residual interaction effects beyond the charging energy.@xcite such residual interaction effects are at the center of the present investigation .    in a weakly diffusive and/or chaotic dot , the `` randomness '' of the single ",
    "particle eigenfunctions induces randomness of the interaction matrix elements .",
    "the statistical fluctuations of these interaction matrix elements ( evaluated in the non  interacting basis ) were calculated for a dot with a large thouless conductance @xmath2  @xcite and were found to be suppressed . in the limit @xmath3 ,",
    "only a few interaction terms survive , leading to the so  called universal hamiltonian.@xcite for spinless electrons , the interaction part of the universal hamiltonian is composed of just the charging energy term .",
    "this shows that the ci model is appropriate for spinless electrons and in the limit @xmath3 . when the electron spin is taken into account , there is also an exchange interaction term , and , in the absence of a time  reversal ",
    "symmetry breaking magnetic field , a cooper  channel  like term .",
    "the exchange interaction term was found to have important effects on the finite  temperature peak spacing distribution.@xcite for finite @xmath2 , further interaction terms exist and can be calculated within a systematic expansion of the residual interaction in inverse powers of @xmath2 .",
    "using a two  body effective screened interaction in the limit of a small gas constant @xmath4 , one can show that for a diffusive dot the average and the standard deviation of these residual interaction terms are at least of the order @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the single  particle mean level spacing , while for a chaotic dot the standard deviation of the residual interaction terms is of the order @xmath7.@xcite for finite values of @xmath2 , such terms affect the ground  state energy of the dot and various observables .",
    "in particular , the position of the conductance peak height at low temperatures is determined by the change of the ground ",
    "state energy upon the addition of an electron to the dot ( addition energy ) .",
    "thus , finite@xmath2corrections to the universal hamiltonian affect the peak  spacing distribution.@xcite",
    "most studies of interaction effects have been limited to specific models of a dot .",
    "these models include an anderson model for a diffusive dot or a billiard model for a ballistic chaotic dot , plus coulomb or hubbard  like ( short  range ) interactions .",
    "for a small number of electrons , exact numerical solutions are possible.@xcite for a larger number of electrons , such models have been studied in the hartree ",
    "fock ( hf ) approximation  @xcite and in a density functional approach.@xcite these models contributed significantly to our understanding of interaction effects in almost isolated dots , but they also contain non  generic features .",
    "our approach to interaction effects in diffusive and/or chaotic , almost isolated quantum dots aims at a generic understanding of interaction effects beyond the @xmath3 limit .",
    "our starting point is a hamiltonian consisting of a one  body and a two  body part .",
    "the one  body part describes chaos and/or disorder and is , within an energy interval of width @xmath8 , described by the appropriate random ",
    "matrix ensemble , i.e. , the orthogonal ensemble for conserved time ",
    "reversal symmetry and the unitary ensemble for broken time  reversal symmetry .",
    "the two  body part is given by the coulomb interaction .",
    "however , the randomness of the single  particle wave functions induces a randomness of the two ",
    "body interaction matrix elements when the latter are written in terms of the eigenfunctions of the random one  body part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this results in a generic ensemble of the two ",
    "body interaction that we derive and use in our studies .",
    "the paper consists of two parts . in the first part ,",
    "we derive the statistical properties of the two  body matrix elements ( the `` induced two  body ensemble '' ) .",
    "we find that these properties are determined both by the underlying space ",
    "time symmetries of the system and by features of the two  body interaction .",
    "we classify the possible forms of the first two cumulants of the interaction matrix elements .",
    "this is accomplished by writing these cumulants in a covariant form , ensuring invariance under a change of the single  particle basis .",
    "the first moments ( average values ) reproduce the universal hamiltonian in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the second cumulants are characterized by a constant @xmath9 ( @xmath10 for a diffusive dot and @xmath11 for a chaotic dot ) .",
    "the invariance classes of the second cumulants are determined by the symmetry properties of the interaction matrix elements under permutations of the single  particle orbitals .",
    "these symmetries are different for , e.g. , a contact interaction or a short but finite  range interaction .",
    "we note that the two  body part of one class of the ensembles which we construct , coincides with the two  body embedded gaussian ensembles.@xcite these ensembles were introduced in the nuclear shell model to study the validity of rmt for the statistical description of nuclear spectra.@xcite the spectral properties of these embedded ensembles were recently analyzed using an eigenvector expansion of the second moments.@xcite combined with a random  matrix one  body part , such a two  body ensemble was used to study interaction effects  @xcite and ground - state magnetization  @xcite in quantum dots with a small number of electrons .",
    "the spin structure of a system with a spin  conserving random interaction was studied in ref .  .",
    "in the presence of spin degrees of freedom , one needs to use non  antisymmetrized two  body matrix elements , and our classification of the second cumulants is generally done for such elements .",
    "the spinless case requires only antisymmetrized matrix elements .",
    "their second cumulants are obtained directly from the cumulants of the non  antisymmetrized elements .",
    "the two  body ensembles that correspond to a contact interaction exist only in the presence of spin .",
    "in the second part of the paper , we use the hartree ",
    "fock ( hf ) approximation to work out interaction effects for some of the ensembles introduced in the first part .",
    "it is difficult to study the properties of ensembles involving a two  body interaction .",
    "exact numerical solutions can be obtained only for dots with a small number of electrons . for a larger number of electrons ,",
    "it is necessary to make approximations .",
    "the hf approximation serves this purpose .",
    "it has the advantage of being based on a single  particle picture ( optimized to take into account interaction effects ) , and one can still use concepts familiar from the independent  particle approach .",
    "while the hf approximation has been studied in the context of specific models for an interacting dot,@xcite the present work is free of any model ",
    "dependent effects and constitutes a generic statistical hf approach .",
    "our hf studies are limited to spinless electrons .",
    "we investigate , in particular , the statistical properties of the interaction matrix elements in the basis of hf single  particle eigenfunctions , and of the hf single ",
    "particle eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "the interest in such work derives , among others , from generic studies of quantum dots with a large number of electrons .",
    "these often use a hf single  particle basis ( rather than a basis defined in terms of non  interacting electrons).@xcite it is then often assumed that the statistical properties of the matrix elements in the hf basis are similar to those of the non ",
    "interacting basis.@xcite our work permits us to test such assumptions , whereas previous studies ( done in the framework of specific models of a dot with interactions ) have focused on the spectral statistics of the hf levels only .",
    "we find that , in the limit of small interaction strength @xmath12 , the average interaction matrix elements in the hf basis acquire a @xmath9 correction ( this explains the increase of the average hf gap with @xmath12 ) , while the second cumulants remain very close to their input values . as for the spectral statistics ,",
    "our generic studies confirm the conclusions of previous studies .",
    "the nearest ",
    "neighbor spacings of filled and empty hf levels follow the wigner distribution of rmt , while the distribution of the hf gap deviates from this distribution .",
    "an open problem has been whether correlations of filled and empty levels follow or deviate from rmt .",
    "our studies of an appropriate spacing correlator indicate that the gap weakens the correlations between spacings on its opposite sides . on the other hand",
    ", this spacing correlator is found to follow rmt within the filled or empty levels alone , adding further support to the conjecture that the filled and empty levels separately satisfy rmt statistics .",
    "we also show that the hf ensemble satisfies orthogonal ( unitary ) invariance , and therefore its wave function statistics is that of rmt .",
    "we use the statistical hf approach to study the statistics of observables , and in particular of the peak  spacing and peak  height distributions .",
    "the results can be easily interpreted in koopmans limit,@xcite which assumes that the hf wave functions remain unchanged upon the addition ( or removal ) of an electron .",
    "koopmans limit has been investigated in previous hf studies,@xcite but the present approach again has the advantage of being generic .",
    "it allows us to define the limitations of koopmans approach , and to go beyond that limit .",
    "in particular , we find that the peak  spacing distribution can be described as a convolution of a wigner distribution ( with an appropriate mean level spacing ) and a gaussian whose width is approximately the standard deviation of a diagonal interaction matrix element . on the other hand , we find that the peak  height distribution is not affected by the residual interaction .    the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ ran ] , we discuss the induced two  body ensembles .",
    "we classify the possible ensembles for the orthogonal and unitary symmetries in sections  [ ortho ] and [ unitary ] , respectively , both in the presence and absence of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the possible ensembles are related to different types of two  body interactions , as characterized by the symmetries of their matrix elements under permutations of the orbitals . in section",
    "[ hf ] we discuss the hf approach to disordered ( or chaotic ) systems in the framework of the many  body ensembles . a perturbative approach that provides a closed expression for the average hf matrix elements for a fixed single ",
    "particle spectrum is described in section  [ mom ] .",
    "numerical studies of both the first and second moments of the interaction matrix elements in the hf basis are presented in section  [ hf - elements ] .",
    "the statistics of the hf single ",
    "particle energies including filled levels , empty levels and the gap are studied in section  [ hf - spect ] , while the statistics of the hf wave function components are studied in section [ hf - wavefunctions ] . finally in section  [ addition ]",
    "we discuss the addition of electrons in the hf approach to disordered systems , and in particular the peak  spacing and peak  height distributions .",
    "we consider a disordered system of interacting electrons , e.g. , a diffusive quantum dot . for simplicity",
    ", we first discuss the case of spinless electrons .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are introduced later in this section . for a given realization of disorder",
    ", we describe the system by a hamiltonian with a one  body part and a two  body interaction , @xmath13 the @xmath14 orthonormal single  particle states @xmath15 .",
    "the one  body part @xmath16 of @xmath17 stands for kinetic energy plus disorder potential , while @xmath18 represents the ( screened ) coulomb interaction .",
    "the @xmath19 are non  antisymmetrized matrix elements of the two  body interaction ( @xmath20 is a product state of particle 1 in state @xmath21 and particle 2 in state @xmath22 ) . for spinless fermions",
    ", we can rewrite the interaction in terms of antisymmetrized matrix elements @xmath23 as @xmath24    disorder is taken into account by postulating that @xmath16 is random .",
    "the way this randomness is modeled turns out to be rather immaterial .",
    "indeed , we recall that for weak disorder and in the long  wavelength limit , all models for non  interacting disordered systems yield the same supersymmetric field theory , the non  linear supersymmetric sigma model.@xcite this field theory contains one essential parameter , the dimensionless thouless conductance @xmath2 .",
    "we will work out properties of the system described by the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ensemble - a ] ) in terms of an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath2 . we will carry the expansion up to and including terms of order @xmath25 .",
    "the non  linear sigma model shows that to zeroth order in @xmath26 , @xmath16 is equivalent to one of the canonical ensembles of rmt , the gaussian orthogonal ( goe ) , unitary ( gue ) or symplectic ( gse ) ensemble of random matrices , depending upon the symmetry of the problem.@xcite corrections calculated by using the expansion in inverse powers of @xmath2 yield deviations from predictions of rmt but do not violate the fundamental symmetries of the problem ( invariance under orthogonal , unitary or symplectic transformations of the basis of single  particle states ) .",
    "indeed , the derivation of the non  linear sigma model is based upon these symmetries , which are thus deeply embedded in the model and are valid beyond canonical rmt .",
    "this fact will be important as we will heavily rely on these symmetries to determine the effective form of the hamiltonian @xmath17 .",
    "we will focus on the cases of orthogonal and unitary symmetry and will not consider symplectic ensembles in the sequel .",
    "the randomness of @xmath16 induces a degree of randomness into the two  body matrix elements @xmath18 . to see this we recall that every observable @xmath27 is defined as an average over the ensemble @xmath16 . because of the invariance of that ensemble under orthogonal ( or unitary or symplectic ) transformations of the single  particle basis , @xmath27 must likewise be invariant under all such transformations .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 can depend on the two  body interaction @xmath18 only through invariants constructed from the matrix elements @xmath18 .",
    "other properties of the coulomb interaction that are not encapsulated in the invariants are not relevant . on a formal level , this fact allows us to define equivalence classes of two  body interactions .",
    "members of the same class share the same set of invariants although the interactions may differ in other properties .",
    "all two  body interactions which belong to the same class as the coulomb interaction will give rise to identical average properties of the ensemble  ( [ ensemble ] ) .",
    "these members may be said to form an induced ensemble of two  body interactions .",
    "the word `` induced '' indicates that the ensemble owes its existence to the randomness of the one  body part @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we deal effectively with an induced two  body random ensemble although the coulomb interaction _ per se _ is fixed and not random at all",
    ". we aim at reformulating the ensemble of hamiltonians @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ ensemble ] ) in such a way that only the relevant features ( i.e. , the invariants ) of @xmath18 are kept . in doing so",
    ", we do not follow strictly the line of argument just given because we perform separately the averages over the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath16 . the induced two ",
    "body ensemble will result from the average over the eigenfunctions .",
    "we accordingly transform @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ ensemble - a ] ) to the basis @xmath28 of single  particle eigenstates of @xmath29 .",
    "this yields @xmath30 in an interval of length @xmath31 ( where @xmath6 is the average single ",
    "particle level spacing ) , the eigenvalues @xmath32 obey canonical random  matrix statistics . because of the randomness of the single  particle eigenfunctions , the elements @xmath33 are also random .",
    "moreover , the @xmath32 s are uncorrelated with the eigenfunctions and , thus , with the @xmath34 s .",
    "this last property holds strictly if @xmath29 stands for the goe or gue , i.e. , in the limit @xmath35 . for a diffusive system , it holds up to and including terms of order @xmath25 .    the number of single  particle levels @xmath36 is usually chosen to be finite .",
    "thus , the interaction in eq .  ( [ eigen - ensemble ] ) is generally an effective interaction , e.g. , a screened coulomb interaction .",
    "such an effective interaction was , for example , derived in refs .   within an interval of @xmath37 levels around the fermi energy of the dot .",
    "the authors used the random  phase approximation ( rpa ) in the limit where the gas constant @xmath38 .",
    "the effective interaction is then given by the unscreened zero  momentum fourier component of the coulomb interaction plus a short  range screened coulomb interaction ( whose exact form depends on the dimensionality and geometry of the system ) . in general , for a finite system this effective interaction also includes surface charge terms.@xcite these can be eliminated by assuming , for instance , periodic boundary conditions and will not be taken into account in the sequel .    if the spin of the electrons is taken into account , the hamiltonian  ( [ ensemble ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath39 where @xmath40 describes a spin up / down electron and @xmath21 denotes an orbital state .",
    "the one  body hamiltonian @xmath29 is spin  independent ( i.e. , there is no spin  orbit coupling ) .",
    "the interaction matrix elements are also assumed to be spin  independent as is the case for the coulomb interaction .    in analogy to the transformation leading from eq .",
    "( [ ensemble ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eigen - ensemble ] ) , the ensemble  ( [ ensemble - s ] ) can be written in terms of the orbital eigenfunctions @xmath41 of the one  body hamiltonian @xmath29 . since the transformation from the basis of states @xmath42 to that of the states @xmath41 does not involve the spin degree of freedom , the single  particle energies @xmath32 are spin  degenerate , and the interaction matrix elements remain spin  independent .",
    "thus , when the spin is included , eq .",
    "( [ eigen - ensemble ] ) is replaced by @xmath43 in contrast to the spinless case where @xmath17 could be expressed in terms of the antisymmetrized matrix elements @xmath44 , eq .",

    "we now work out the first and second moments of @xmath45 by averaging over the eigenfunctions @xmath28 .",
    "we first calculate the mean value @xmath46 of the two  body matrix elements , invoking orthogonal or unitary invariance . in the orthogonal case",
    "there are three invariants : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . in the unitary case ,",
    "only the first two invariants exist .",
    "we consider first the case of antisymmetrized matrix elements and include spin below .",
    "for the antisymmetrized element @xmath50 , the first two invariants combine to @xmath51 , while the third one gives no contribution .",
    "we conclude ( for both the orthogonal and unitary symmetries ) that @xmath52 the average interaction in ( [ eigen - ensemble ] ) is then given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the particle  number operator . for a fixed number @xmath1 of fermions ,",
    "the average interaction is simply a constant @xmath55 . for a quantum dot , the zero  momentum fourier component of the coulomb interaction is unscreened and its contribution to @xmath56 is the charging energy @xmath57 where @xmath0 is the dot s capacitance .",
    "the contribution of the screened short  range coulomb interaction can be estimated using the diagrammatic expansion and is of order @xmath6 . for finite @xmath2",
    ", there are corrections of order @xmath26 .    for the case with spin ,",

    "is absent for the unitary case .",
    "using eq .",

    "consequently , the peak  height distribution is similar to the distribution predicted from standard rmt .",
    "the residual interaction only affects the average values of the partial widths .",
    "in this paper we have discussed a generic approach towards the understanding of the statistical properties of an ( almost ) closed diffusive or chaotic quantum dot in the limit of large but finite thouless conductance @xmath2 .    the randomness of the single  particle hamiltonian of a closed diffusive or chaotic dot induces randomness into the two  body interaction matrix elements when these are expressed in the eigenbasis of the single  particle hamiltonian . in the first part of this paper we have classified",
    "the resulting induced two  body ensembles .",
    "these depend on both , the underlying space ",
    "time symmetries of the dot , and the symmetries of the interaction matrix elements under permutations of the single  particle basis .",
    "our classification applies to the non  antisymmetrized matrix elements and therefore holds in the presence of spin degrees of freedom . the ensembles for the spinless case follow directly by antisymmetrizing the interaction matrix elements .",
    "we have ignored spin ",
    "orbit scattering in the dot , so the resulting two  body ensembles have either orthogonal or unitary symmetry depending on whether time ",
    "reversal symmetry is conserved or broken . aside from the symmetries ,",
    "the ensembles are characterized by three parameters : the mean level spacing @xmath6 due to the random one  body hamiltonian , the parameter @xmath12 which measures the fluctuations of the two  body interaction matrix elements , and the number @xmath1 of electrons on the dot .",
    "the presence of two  body interactions poses difficulties in treating the many  body system .",
    "therefore , in the second part of this work we have used the hf approximation to study generic interaction effects in an ( almost ) closed dot .",
    "the hf approximation is not only tractable , but also allows us to use a single  particle formulation , optimized to include interaction effects .",
    "applying the hf approximation to the two  body ensembles , we have developed a generic statistical hf approach . in this approach",
    "we have solved the hf equations for a large number of realizations of the ensemble , thereby generating a one  body ensemble of single  particle hf energies and wave functions .",
    "we have studied the statistical properties of this induced hf one  body ensemble , distinguishing the lowest @xmath1 filled levels from the remaining empty ones . for both the filled and the empty levels separately , the nearest  neighbor level spacing follows the wigner distribution .",
    "this is not true for the hf gap separating the filled and empty levels .",
    "the gap distribution has the form of a convolution of a wigner distribution with a gaussian whose width is proportional to @xmath12 , while the average value of the gap increases quadratically with @xmath12 ( in leading order ) . by studying a suitable spacing correlator , we have found that the gap weakens the correlation between filled and empty levels , but similar correlators within the filled or empty levels separately continue to follow rmt .",
    "we have shown that the single  particle hf ensemble satisfies orthogonal ( unitary ) invariance in the presence ( absence ) of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "consequently the hf wave function components ( in a fixed basis ) satisfy rmt statistics .",
    "we have also studied the statistics of the interaction matrix elements in the hf basis ( which reflect the statistical properties of the hf wave functions ) .",
    "the distributions of the hf matrix elements are gaussian and , thus , can be characterized by their first two moments .",
    "the average of a diagonal interaction matrix element acquires a @xmath9 correction .",
    "the value of that correction depends on whether the corresponding single ",
    "particle orbitals are both filled , both empty , or whether one is filled , the other , empty .",
    "the variances , on the other hand , remain close to their values in the non  interacting basis .",
    "the hf ensemble can be used to study the statistical properties of various observables . in particular , we have studied the generic properties of the peak  spacing distribution and of the peak  height distribution . a simple interpretation of the results is provided in koopmans limit where it is assumed that the hf wave functions do not change upon the addition of an electron to the dot . the peak  spacing distribution is well approximated by a convolution of a wigner distribution with a gaussian whose width is the standard deviation of a diagonal interaction matrix element .",
    "the peak  height distribution , on the other hand , is found to be insensitive to the residual interactions .",
    "we have confined ourselves to the hf approximation for spinless electrons .",
    "the presence of spin leads to additional technical difficulties in a mean  field approach .",
    "in particular , only the @xmath479component of total spin ( but not total spin itself ) is conserved . because of this restriction in our calculations , it is not possible to make a quantitative comparison between our results and experiment . in the presence of spin ,",
    "the single  particle levels are doubly degenerate .",
    "therefore , the peak  spacing distribution is expected to be bimodal .",
    "the exchange interaction associated with the spin degrees of freedom explains the finite  temperature suppression of the width of the peak  spacing distribution,@xcite but at low temperatures the distribution is expected to remain bimodal .",
    "no such bimodality is observed in the experiments , however .",
    "this fact is related to the fluctuating part of the interaction ( which is of order @xmath480 ) .",
    "we have seen that in the spinless case , these fluctuations affect the shape of the peak  spacing distribution and lead to a distribution which is intermediate between a wigner distribution and a gaussian distribution , in qualitative agreement with experiments",
    ". it would be interesting to study the corresponding finite@xmath2 effects in the presence of spin , using the hf approximation within the induced two  body ensembles discussed in section  [ ran ] .",
    "this should lead to a generic peak  spacing distribution that can be directly compared with the experimental data .",
    "as for the peak  height distribution , rmt plus exchange interaction ( without the fluctuating part of the interaction ) were found to provide a quantitative description of the observed features at low temperatures.@xcite we have shown here that in the absence of spin , the peak  height distribution is insensitive to the fluctuating residual interaction . if this conclusion continues to hold in the presence of spin , it will fully explain the observed low ",
