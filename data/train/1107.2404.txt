    "each scenario carries with it tentative observational evidence and hardships imposed by unrealised theoretical predictions .",
    "while considerable attention has been focused on the post - maximum decline of the sn  ia light curve , less has been paid to the rise of the sn  ia from explosion to maximum brightness .",
    "this is due to the dearth of data in the days following the sn explosion and the intrinsic difficulty of finding sne  ia shortly after explosion .",
    "the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) has been successful at finding sne in the nearby universe ( redshift @xmath12 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) supernova survey @xcite has found and monitored 391 sne at moderate redshift ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "higher redshift searches such as the supernova legacy survey @xcite and essence @xcite benefit from cosmological time dilation , allowing the sn rise to be spread out over more days in the observer s frame .    a first attempt at quantifying sn  ia rise times by @xcite analysed 54 historical light curves gathered from photographic plates and visual @xmath0 magnitude estimates , finding a typical rise of 1920  d. recent attempts have made use of more reliable data taken with charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) which are linear in translating photons to counts over a large dynamic range . a seminal paper by ( * ?",

    "light - curve data are then fit using a two - stretch fitting parametrisation .",
    "the parameters being fit via a @xmath36 minimization technique are the time of maximum light @xmath42 , the flux at maximum light @xmath34 , the rise stretch @xmath43 , and the fall stretch @xmath44 ( see  [ s : two_stretch ] for details ) after correcting the light curves for time dilation using redshifts obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",

    "because a particular light - curve fit can have systematic residuals relative to the input template ( i.e. , several data points in one portion of the light curve all show negative residuals , while data in another portion all show positive residuals ) , the residuals at different epochs are correlated , and the rms measurements are an overestimate of the true uncertainties .",
    "it is difficult to quantify how the residuals are correlated because different light - curve fits have different patterns of residuals .",

    "is fixed at @xmath147 , to explore rgs as a possible companion , and we set @xmath136 equal to either 0 ( i.e. , no emission is detected ) or 0.1 , the expected fraction of sne with detectable shock emission based on the opening angle of the shock . for each of our four different unshocked templates , we calculate the minimum @xmath92 statistic for models by varying @xmath144 to find the best - fit shocked template .",
    "the fit is restricted to data within the range of @xmath148  d.    we note that the minimum reduced @xmath92 in all of our fits for @xmath144 exceeds 1 and is usually closer to 34 .",
    "this is not completely unexpected since data at @xmath68  d were not included in the two - stretch fitting procedure used to normalise the light curves , and this may induce correlated errors into the data at @xmath68  d. we also suspect that the reported errors for the earliest photometry epochs may be underestimated .",
    "furthermore , the scatter in the data points may even be the physical result of a distribution of companion masses , separation distances , and viewing angles contributing to the emitted flux from shock interaction .",

    "there is a significant degree of degeneracy between the parameters , making the task of disentangling the true sign of companion interaction at this level extremely difficult .",
    "for instance , for our template with @xmath139 and @xmath140  d , we do not see signs of any interaction .",
    "however , had we used a template with @xmath139 and @xmath141  d , we would find that if the fraction of sne that showed signs of shock interaction is @xmath149 , then @xmath92 is minimised with @xmath150 .",
    "similarly , when varying @xmath119 and @xmath67 in the unshocked template , suitable matches to the data can be found by adjusting the amount of shock interaction .",

    "this result makes use of all of the light - curve data at @xmath68  d as an ensemble .",
    "better constraints could be placed on individual , excellently sampled light curves in the rise region . in particular",
    ", efforts to obtain data at bluer wavelengths , where the shock interaction is stronger and more easily detectable , will greatly help to break degeneracies in the fitting process .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have argued that the transfer of angular momentum from the companion donor star to the c / o white dwarf acts to increase the critical mass required to explode and the time required for the white dwarf to explode .",
    "consequently , the donor star may possibly evolve past the red giant phase , vastly reducing the cross section for interaction with sn ejecta .",
    "the subsequent shock emission for a rg would decrease beyond current detection limits , thus saving rgs as a possible donor in the single - degenerate scenario .",
    "the increased time to explosion allows the mass ejected from the envelope of the donor star time to diffuse to the density of the ambient interstellar medium , offering an explanation for the tight constraints placed on the presence of @xmath152 in nebular spectra of sne  ia ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band rise - time distributions of nearby type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) . drawing mostly from the recently published lick observatory supernova search sample of sne  ia @xcite , together with other published nearby sne  ia with data starting at least one week before maximum light </S>",
    "<S> , we use a two - stretch template - fitting method to measure the rise and decline of @xmath2 light curves . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of  sne with high - quality light curves indicates that the longer the time between explosion and maximum light ( i.e. , the rise time ) , the slower the decline of the light curve after maximum . </S>",
    "<S> however , sne with slower post - maximum decline rates have a faster rise than would be expected from a single - parameter family of light curves , indicating that sn  ia light curves are not a single - parameter family of varying widths . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the @xmath0-band rise - time distribution for spectroscopically normal sne  ia to those exhibiting high - velocity spectral features indicates that high - velocity ( hv ) sne  ia have shorter @xmath0-band rise times compared to their spectroscopically normal counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> after normalising the @xmath0-band light curves to  = 1.1  mag ( i.e. , correcting the post - maximum decline to have the same shape as our template ) , we find that spectroscopically normal sne  ia have a rise time of @xmath3 , while hv sne have a faster @xmath0-band rise time of @xmath4 . despite differences in the @xmath0 band </S>",
    "<S> , we find that hv and normal sne  ia have similar rise times in the @xmath1 band . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the initial rise of a sn  ia @xmath0-band light curve follows a power law with index @xmath5 , consistent with a parabolic rise in flux predicted by an expanding fireball toy model . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our early - time @xmath0-band data to models for the predicted signature of companion interaction arising from the single - degenerate progenitor scenario . </S>",
    "<S> there is a substantial degree of degeneracy between the adopted power - law index of the sn light - curve template , the rise time , and the amount of shock emission required to match the data .    </S>",
