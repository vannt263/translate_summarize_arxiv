    "early ultraviolet ( uv ) emission from type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) is poorly known by now . only a very few brightest events have been observed a decade ago with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) . although observational data were sometimes quite fascinating , as in the case of sn 1990n ( leibundgut  et  al .",
    "@xcite , jeffery  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , an amount of observed uv light curves and spectra remained too small to reveal what is typical for the uv emission from sne  ia and how individual features of the explosion can be displayed .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has slightly improved the situation .",
    "more data of better quality were obtained .",
    "this allowed theorists to make a comparison between the predictions of explosion models and the observational results .",
    "reproduction of supernova uv emission is a good test for an explosion model because this spectral region reflects more directly the distribution of synthesized during the explosion and the conditions in the exploding star .",
    "several models were already used to fit the observed spectra .",
    "analyses of early and late emission from sne  ia by kirshner  et  al .",
    "@xcite , ruiz - lapuente  et  al .",
    "@xcite , nugent  et  al .",
    "@xcite show that chandrasekhar - mass models dd4 ( woosley & weaver  @xcite ) and w7 ( nomoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) and sub - chandrasekhar - mass helium detonation models ( see livne  @xcite ; livne & glasner  @xcite ; woosley & weaver  @xcite ; hflich & khokhlov  @xcite ) can reproduce some features of uv spectra of sne  ia quite well .    in this letter we calculate the light curves of the similar models and discuss how they differ from each other in several uv wavelength ranges .",
    "it is quite probable that more observational data will soon be available with the hst , and that the far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) , operating at shorter wavelengths ( sembach  @xcite ) , will be able to obtain light curves and spectra of sne  ia in the range where they were not observed so far .",
    "the analysis proposed here can help to distinguish which mode of explosion is actually realized in the sne  ia .",
    "in our analysis we have studied two chandrasekhar - mass models : the classical deflagration model w7 ( nomoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the delayed detonation model dd4 ( woosley & weaver @xcite ) , as well as two sub - chandrasekhar - mass models : helium detonation model 4 of livne & arnett  ( @xcite ) ( hereafter , la4 ) and low - mass detonation model with low production ( hereafter , wd065 ; ruiz - lapuente  et  al .",
    "main parameters of these models are gathered in the table  [ uvfluxes ] , as well as the values of rise time and maximum uv fluxes in the standard iue range ( just as it is the most typical form of representation ; e.g. , pun  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) and in the fuse range . for definiteness the distance to a supernova",
    "is supposed to be 10  mpc .",
    "the method used here for light curve modeling is multi - energy group radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "our code stella ( blinnikov & bartunov  @xcite ; blinnikov  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) solves simultaneously hydrodynamic equations and time - dependent equations for the angular moments of intensity averaged over fixed frequency bands , using up to @xmath0 zones for the lagrangean coordinate and up to 100 frequency bins ( i.e. , energy groups ) .",
    "this allows us to have a reasonably accurate representation of non - equilibrium continuum radiation in a self - consistent calculation when no additional estimates of thermalization depth are needed . local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) for ionization and atomic level populations is assumed in our modeling . in the equation of state ,",
    "lte ionization and recombination are taken into account .",
    "the effect of line opacity is treated as an expansion opacity according to the prescription of eastman & pinto  ( @xcite ) and blinnikov  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main results of our calculations are presented in figs .",
    "[ iue ] ,  [ fuse ] .",
    "the light curves of our models are shown in near and far uv ranges .",
    "the fluxes are plotted as they would be seen for supernovae at distance of 10  mpc .",
    "declared sensitivity of fuse is @xmath1  ergs  s@xmath2  @xmath3  @xmath2 , and sensitivity of hst ( at working range of wavelengths almost equal to that of iue ) is roughly @xmath4  ergs  s@xmath2  @xmath3  @xmath2 .",
    "this allows us to estimate that sne  ia could be observed up to 300  mpc in the near uv and up to 30  mpc in the far uv ( with hst and fuse , respectively ) .",
    "yet it should be noticed that in the far uv sne  ia are bright enough only during several days , and their flux declines very quickly after the maximum light , so the probability of discovering for them is quite low , unless they are very close to us ( a few mpc or even less ) .",

    "we can see likely behaviour in near - uv wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ iue ] ) . in far uv",
    ", differences grow up , so that even at maximum light one can distinguish between two chandrasekhar - mass models .",
    "such a behaviour can most probably be explained by different distribution of inside debris of exploded star . in our case ,",
    "the fraction of decreases more sharply in the model w7 , and this perhaps leads to the faster decline of its light curve .",
    "the shape of the uv light curve of wd065 is conformal to those of chandrasekhar - mass models , though it shows much lower absolute flux ( due to an order - of - magnitude lower mass ) .",
    "the light curve maxima of the chandrasekhar - mass models are shifted progressively towards later epochs for longer wavelengths remaining almost equal in brightness , while the wd065 maxima occur at nearly the same epoch for all of the iue and fuse ranges , and the emission virtually disappears at the shorter edge of the spectrum ( see table  [ uvfluxes ] and fig .",
    "[ iue ] ) , since such a small amount of as present in this model is not able to maintain high temperature inside the ejecta .",
    "the emission of wd065 in far uv becomes so weak that it could be detected only if supernova exploded in our neighbourhood ( not farther than a few hundreds of parsecs from us ) .",
    "the model la4 ( helium detonation in outer layers ) is apparently distinguished by its rise time in the shortest spectral bands .",
    "the most interesting feature of this light curve is its clear two - maxima structure in the short lwp range .",
    "the earliest spike of the far - uv radiation is due to the outer layer specific for this model .",
    "it is well known that those helium detonation models are too blue near visual maximum ( hflich & khokhlov  @xcite ; ruiz - lapuente  et  al .",
    "this is also confirmed by our _ ubvri _ computations ( sorokina  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) . in far uv",
    ", la4 looks out not so hot , yet it can be detected in far uv earlier than in visual light .",
    "one should be cautious applying our results directly to observations in uv range .",
    "a large fraction of sne  ia shows a significant correlation with star - forming regions ( bartunov  et  al .",
    "@xcite ; mcmillan & ciardullo  @xcite ; bartunov & tsvetkov @xcite ) .",
    "the circumstellar medium in those regions can absorb radiation , especially in uv band . in this case",
    "our predictions should be used as an input for calculations of reprocessing of uv photons to redder wavelengths .",
    "certainly , more thorough investigation of the uv emission from sne  ia has to be done .",
    "it is still necessary to calculate uv light curves of wider range of sne  ia models and to predict their uv spectra .",
    "this work is worth doing because , as it is seen from this letter , near - uv and far - uv observations with modern uv space telescopes , when combined with standard _",
    "ubvri _ study , could be used as an efficient means to distinguish modes of explosion of thermonuclear supernovae leading us to better understanding of these phenomena .",
