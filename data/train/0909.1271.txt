    "rs  ophiuchi is a recurrent nova ( rn ) with at least six recorded outbursts , in 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 , 1985 , and 2006 @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a massive white dwarf ( wd ) and a red giant ( rg ) @xcite . like classical novae ,",
    "eruptions are caused by a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) in material accreted on the surface of the wd @xcite , although it is unclear if the accretion disk is fed by roche lobe overflow or the rg wind @xcite .",
    "rne are divided into subclasses , depending on the nature of the secondary star @xcite . during eruptions in rne with a rg secondary ( like rs  oph ) ,",
    "the ejected material runs into the rg wind , which is shocked .",
    "broad emission lines arise in the shocked wind and ejecta , which narrow with time as the ejecta decelerate @xcite . in outburst ,",
    "the infrared ( ir ) spectrum is dominated by these lines , and by free - free radiation @xcite . in quiesence ,",
    "the ir spectrum is dominated by the rg .",
    "dust emission was detected within three years of the 1967 eruption by @xcite and in 1983 by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) survey @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite detected silicate dust features @xmath2 months after the 2006 outburst ; they concluded that the dust survives from one eruption to the next , and that some of the rg wind is shielded from the shock and ultraviolet blast from the outbursts .",
    "knowledge of the elemental abundances in the atmosphere of the rg is important for understanding the eruption , because the tnr on the wd occurs in material accreted from the rg secondary .",
    "@xcite modelled a 2006 august spectrum of rs  oph in the @xmath3  range and determined the following parameters for the rg : @xmath4k , @xmath5 , @xmath6=0.0\\pm0.5 , [ c / h]=-0.8\\pm0.2 $ ] and @xmath7=+0.6\\pm0.3 $ ] .",
    "these abundances may vary considerably however , if the rg is contaminated by the nova ejecta , as has been suggested by @xcite . irradiation of the rg by the still - hot wd may also be a complicating factor in the immediate aftermath of an eruption .",
    "the latest outburst of rs  oph was discovered on 2006 february 12.85  ut @xcite ; we assume the eruption began on this date ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "ir spectra from the first 100 days of the outburst are discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    here",
    "we present ir spectroscopy of rs  oph obtained on later dates and at different orbital configurations .",

    "the observations were obtained in stare - nod - along - slit mode , with a 2-pixel - wide slit .",
    "we obtained data in the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , short @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , long @xmath13 ( @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) band grisms , giving a spectral coverage of @xmath18 .",
    "the resolving power is @xmath19 .",
    "we obtained spectra of hr  6493 ( f3v ) immediately before we obtained spectra of rs  oph , for calibration purposes .",
    "the data reduction method followed the usual routines for ir spectra .",
    "the data at one nod position were subtracted from data at a second nod position to remove sky emission lines , and the sky - subtracted data were extracted from the uist array .",
    "the extracted spectra of rs  oph were divided by the extracted spectra of the standard star to remove telluric absorption .",
    "the target was observed at a similar airmass as the standard star to optimize the cancellation of these features .",
    "the ratioed data were then multiplied by a normalised blackbody to provide flux calibrated spectra ; this assumes the spectrum of hr  6493 is a 6700k blackbody , with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the data were wavelength calibrated using the spectra of arc lamps and telluric lines in the standard star data .",
    "observations were made using spex @xcite on the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) in double - beam mode .",
    "the slit dimensions were @xmath21 and the nod was @xmath22 along the slit .",
    "the resolving power is @xmath23 . to minimize atmospheric dispersion ,",
    "the parallactic angle was set such that the slit was oriented vertically .",
    "internal wavelength calibration and standard star observations were interspersed between spectra of rs oph . in all cases the star hd159170",

    "contributions of the various molecular and atomic species to the total opacity are shown in figure  [ _ inent ] .",

    "this problem is apparent in all data , but it is more acute in 2007 ( see figure  [ _ fits ] ) .",
    "the peak due to the h@xmath42 minimum is absent from these spectra , implying a change in the ir spectrum of the rg .",

    "the flux in the model falls below the flux in the data for wavelengths 3 : rs  oph clearly exhibits an ir excess .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this excess : free - free radiation and dust emission .",
    "@xcite reported the appearance of the silicate features at 9.7and 18  in _ spitzer _ data between 2006 april and 2006 september .",
    "they concluded the dust was present before the outburst , that hot gas emission masked the dust emission in the earlier data , but as the emission from the gas subsided , the silicate features were revealed . since",
    "free - free emission had faded by late 2006 , and the silicate features were observed at this time , dust is the likely source of the excess in our data .",
    "@xcite used the dusty code to model the _",
    "spectrum and found a dust temperature of 600k . from his fit , we find the dust contributes @xmath50 at 4 , approximately 50% of the flux in our 2006 data , and 40% in our 2008 data .",
    "since the contribution is significant at the longest wavelengths in our data , and the dust emission peaks longward of @xmath51 , we use a blackbody in our computations to mimic the dust emission : the effect of a @xmath52 dust emissivity law on the wein tail is not expected to be significant .",
    "the inclusion of a blackbody greatly improves our fits to the @xmath53  region for all but three spectra : 2007 june 1 , 2007 june 11 and 2007 july 28 ; the dust emission is at least a factor of 3 weaker in 2007 .",

    "the dust temperatures ( @xmath54 ) are given in column ( 8) of table  [ obs ] .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath54 is at least @xmath55k because of the absence of data at @xmath56 , where the dust emits most strongly and dominates the continuum . the temperature of the dust is consistent with that in @xcite , and the dust contribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the _ spitzer _ fluxes .",
    "therefore , we are confident that the excess we see is emission from the dust detected by @xcite .",
    "these observations therefore support the claim that the dust will be present at the next eruption @xcite .",
    "as already noted , the 2007 spectra are unusual and are further discussed below ; we note that these data were obtained at both ukirt and irtf , so there is no doubt that the effect is real and not instrumental or an artefact of data reduction .    range . from top to bottom , the observation dates ( ut ) are 2006 august 25 , 2007 july 11 , and 2008 july 15 .",
    "the red lines are model atmosphere fits , the blue lines are fits obtained by the addition of a 500k blackbody to the model atmosphere . the flux in the model drops below the flux in the data in the @xmath57  region in the 2006 and 2008 data .",
    "this ir excess is due to emission by dust .",
    "the data have been multiplied by the amounts in brackets to vertically offset for clarity.,width=302 ]",
    "[ [ co ] ] co ~~    in this paper we have presented ir spectroscopy of rs  oph obtained on eight occasions after the 2006 outburst , starting on @xmath58  days and ending on @xmath59  days . although the values of effective temperatures on all observing dates are generally consistent , we see changes in the spectral features from the rg , the most obvious being a significant weakening of the co first overtone bands .",
    "we now consider possible explanations for this behaviour .",
    "the weakening of the co first overtone bands in rs  oph has been observed before , following the 1985 eruption .",
    "@xcite obtained ir spectroscopy of rs  oph in quiesence in 1992 .",
    "the strength of the co absorption features had declined significantly from an observation seven years earlier , 143  days after the 1985 outburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained ir spectra of rs  oph in 1992 , approximately one month from @xcite the co was absent from their data , but the signal - to - noise ratio was low and weak absorption could have been present .",
    "@xcite concluded that co emission from an accretion disc veiled the photospheric features of the rg .",
    "an alternative explanation was given by @xcite : they concluded the outburst contaminated the secondary with carbon , which was then convected away , restoring the carbon abundance to its original value .",
    "@xcite dismissed the @xcite explanation because of the absence of co emission in high signal - to - noise data .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached from our data , which show only band absorption profiles consistent with a late - type star .",
    "@xcite based their conclusion on the discovery of co first overtone emission in the accretion discs around pre - main sequence stars .",
    "however , co first overtone emission has been detected in few eruptive variables : six classical novae ( nq  vul , v842  cen , v705  cas , v1419  aql , v2274  cyg and v2615  oph ) , in which the co formed in cool , neutral regions in the ejecta @xcite and the peculiar eruptive variable v838 mon @xcite .",
    "we do not therefore expect co emission in rs  oph , as the temperature of the shocked gas is @xmath60k @xcite .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the co bands deepen when the nova ejecta contaminate and sweep past the secondary . @xcite and",
    "@xcite argue that the c is overabundant in the nova ejecta from an analysis of _ chandra _ x - ray data . since the c - enriched ejecta would pollute the rg within hours of the outburst , and any carbon deposited in the atmosphere",
    "would quickly combine with oxygen to form co , @xcite suggest that the co bands deepen shortly after optical maximum .",
    "they then argue that the co weakens , as convection reduces the carbon abundance to the pre - outburst value , which is reached after @xmath61 days . however , the co absorption weakened and then deepened in our data , inconsistent with the behaviour predicted by @xcite .",
    "therefore , contamination of the secondary alone can not explain the evolution of the co.    the weakening in our data of the co absorption and the disappearance of the h@xmath42 opacity minimum peak imply a higher rg temperature in 2007 .",
    "a possible explanation is that the wd heats the rg hemisphere facing the primary . as the star orbits the wd , varying fractions of the irradiated hemisphere of the rg",
    "are presented to the observer and the depths of the molecular bands change with phase @xmath26 .",
    "the problem with this explanation is that the weakest co is observed at @xmath62 , when 26% of the irradiated hemisphere is visible , and not at other phases , when similar or even larger fractions are visible .",
    "we would expect the co absorption to be weakest when we see the largest fraction of the irradiated hemisphere and the effect of irradiation ( and hence destruction of co ) is at its maximum .",
    "@xcite monitored rs  oph in quiesence and observed variability in the absorption from the rg .",
    "from the [ tio]@xmath63 , [ tio]@xmath64 , [ vo ] and [ na ] spectral indices ( defined by @xcite ) , they found that features at shorter wavelengths imply an earlier spectral type than features at longer wavelengths ( see also table  5 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they concluded that the variable blue continuum from the hot component veiled the absorption from the rg .",
    "this effect was noticed in other symbiotic stars by @xcite , who showed that the spectral indices are correlated with the visual brightness of the system .",
    "although this explains variability of optical absorption features , it is unlikely to be responsible for the behaviour of the co , as the contribution from the hot component is negligible at 2.3 . furthermore , the cn bands , which are in the blue part of the spectrum , would show a significant and larger change , but this is not observed in our data .",
    "the only alternative explanation for the behaviour of the co is that the rg is intrinsically variable .",
    "@xcite estimated as m2-iii the spectral type of the rg .",
    "they had monitored rs  oph for 12 years after the 1967 outburst and noted that the secondary is `` perhaps slightly variable '' , although the variability they observed could be due to the blue continuum , as mentioned above .",
    "more pertinent to the subject matter of this paper is the measurement by @xcite of a `` co index '' ( @xmath65 = [ 2.4]-[2.17]$ ] , where @xmath66 $ ] and @xmath67 $ ] are narrow - band magnitudes in the region of the co first overtone bandhead ) in 19851986 , in the aftermath of the 1985 eruption ; @xcite found the co index to be variable .",
    "it is unfortunate that , apart from @xcite and @xcite , there has been no @xmath68 m spectroscopy of rs  oph in quiescence .",
    "the spectroscopic variability of the rg should be confirmed by regular ir monitoring , where the contribution from the hot component is negligible .      in this paper",
    "we show that rs  oph exhibits an excess at @xmath69  ( see figure  [ dust ] ) due to emission from the dust already known to exist in the system .",
    "the dust is present in quiesence and survives the uv flash of the outburst .",
    "@xcite suggest that the dust is largely confined to the binary plane and that this higher density material is effectively shielded from the eruption .",
    "furthermore , if the dust temperature is @xmath70k , the dust is heated in outburst to only @xmath71k , below the sublimation temperature , although the situation is marginal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this dust will then be present at the next eruption , provided it survives the passage of the shock .",
    "the fitting analysis ( see section  [ dc ] and table  [ obs ] ) seems to imply that the dust may not have survived , as the ir excess seems to have disappeared between 2006 september and 2007 june , only to develop again , shortly after .",
    "figure  [ _ vis ] shows that the 2007 spectra ( showing no dust excess ) were obtained during a small - amplitude rebrightening event in the visual light curve , while the earlier and later spectra ( with the dust excess ) were obtained when the visual magnitude was close to the quiescent value . since the 2007 spectra show no ir excess , the rise in the @xmath25 band flux might be interpreted in terms of the dissipation of the dust and its subsequent decline to the formation of new dust in the cooling ejecta . however",
    ", this interpretation of the light curve is unlikely , as the optical depth in the visual due to the pre - outburst dust is only @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the temperature of the newly formed silicate dust would be close to the condensation temperature ( @xmath73k ; @xcite ) , much higher than the temperature we find after the redevelopment of the excess , @xmath74k .",
    "also , as discussed in @xcite , conditions are unlikely to be suitable for dust condensation in the ejecta . moreover , as our data only go as far as 5 , it is in any case possible that an ir excess is still present in 2007 , but at wavelengths longer than are covered by our data .    however , it is interesting that the disappearance of the ir excess shortward of 5  coincides almost exactly with a change in the 9.7  silicate feature in",
    "_ spitzer _",
    "spectra @xcite : the narrower feature is present in 2007 april , @xmath75 months before we see no excess .",
    "we will present a detailed discussion of the circumstellar dust in the rs  oph system in a separate paper .",
    "we have presented ir spectroscopy of the rn rs  oph on eight occasions after the most recent outburst in 2006 february .",
    "the spectra contain emission lines from the outburst superimposed on the spectrum of the rg in the system .",
    "we have fitted synthetic spectra to the data to determine the effective temperature of the rg and dusty envelope .",
    "although the parameters on all observation dates are consistent within the uncertainties , the spectral features from the rg are variable .",
    "this variability can not be explained by contamination of the rg , irradiation , or veiling from the hot component .",
    "the most likely explanation is that the rg is intrinsically variable .",
    "this variability should be confirmed by monitoring of rs  oph in the ir , where the rg dominates the continuum .",
    "the spectra show an ir excess at @xmath69  due to emission from the circumstellar dust detected in earlier studies .",
    "the excess is present in our 2006 and 2008 data , but absent in our 2007 data .",
    "however , it is possible the excess is present in 2007 , but at longer wavelengths than are covered by our data .",

    "<S> we present near infrared spectroscopy of the recurrent nova rs  oph obtained on several occasions after its latest outburst in 2006 february . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0  spectra are dominated by the red giant , but the hi , hei and coronal lines present during the eruption are present in all our observations . from the fits of the computed infrared spectral energy distributions to the observed fluxes we find @xmath1k for the red giant . </S>",
    "<S> the first overtone co bands at 2.3 , formed in the atmosphere of the red giant , are variable . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra clearly exhibit an infrared excess due to dust emission longward of 5 ; we estimate an effective temperature for the emitting dust shell of 500  k , and find that the dust emission is also variable , being beyond the limit of detection in 2007 . </S>",
    "<S> most likely , the secondary star in rs  oph is intrinsically variable .    </S>",
