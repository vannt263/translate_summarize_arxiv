    "developing efficient methods to simulate strongly correlated quantum many - body systems is one of the central tasks in modern condensed matter physics .",
    "recently developed tensor network states ( tns ) methods , including the matrix product states ( mps ) , @xcite and the projected entangled pair states ( peps ) , @xcite string bond states(sbs )  @xcite , multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera )  @xciteetc .",
    "provide a promising scheme to solve the long standing quantum many - body problems . in this scheme",
    "the variational space can be represented by polynomially scaled parameters , instead of exponential ones .",
    "once we have the tns representation of the many - particle wave functions , the ground state energies as well as corresponding wave functions can be obtained variationally .",
    "however , in practice it is still a great challenge to obtain the ground state of some complicate physical systems ( such as , frustrated systems and fermionic systems in two dimension ) in the tns scheme .",
    "several difficulties reduce the efficiency . first , though the polynomial scaling , the computational cost respect to the virtual dimension cut - off @xmath2 is still very high , particularly , in two and higher dimensions .",
    "for example , the scaling is @xmath3 for periodic mps algorithm,@xcite @xmath4 for the peps algorithm@xcite . for many important systems , in particular , the fermionic systems , the parameter @xmath2 should be rather large to capture the key physics .",
    "however , limited by current computation ability , we can only deal with small @xmath2 , typically less than 10 . to overcome this difficulty , in seminal works , sandvik et . al@xcite ( based on mps ) and schuch et .",
    "@xcite ( based on sbs ) introduced a monte carlo ( mc ) sampling technique instead of contraction to reduce the computational cost .",
    "the technique has soon been applied to more general tns , such as peps .",
    "@xcite based on the mc sampling technique , the mps scaling can be reduced from @xmath3 to @xmath5 for periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) .",
    "@xcite for sbs,@xcite the scaling is o(@xmath6 ) for a 2d open boundary condition ( obc ) system and o(@xmath5 ) for a 2d periodic system with mc sampling technique , which is significantly lower than the standard contraction methods . for more general peps case",
    ", the scaling can also be well reduced .",
    "@xcite    secondly , the energy function is a highly non - linear function of the tensors . with the increasing of @xmath2",
    ", the parameter space will be very large and it is very easy to be trapped in some local minima , when minimizing the energies , especially for complicated or frustrated systems with a large number of low energy excitations . here , we focus on overcoming this difficulty .    in this work ,",
    "we develop an efficient algorithm to obtain the ground state energy as well as wave function of a tns based on the mc sampling method .",
    "we map the quantum many - particle problem to a classical mechanical problem , in which we treat the tensor elements as the generalized coordinates of the system .",
    "we optimize the energy of the system using a replica exchange molecular dynamics method.@xcite by exchanging the system configurations among higher and lower temperatures , it can explore large phase space and therefore effectively avoid being stuck in the local minima . the replica exchange method has been proved very successful in treating classical spin glass  @xcite and frustrated spin systems@xcite which also suffer from the local minima problem .",
    "it also has been successfully used to optimize other highly non - linear problems , such as three - tangle of general mixed states .",
    "@xcite here , we introduce this method in the tns scheme for the quantum many - body systems .",
    "we make benchmark tests of the method for a 1d hubbard model  @xcite using mps and the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg model using sbs .",
    "@xcite the results show that this method is efficient and robust .",
    "it is also worth to emphasize that the method introduced here is not limited to the special type of tns , but applies to general tns.@xcite",
    "for simplicity , we describe our method using the example of mps type of wave functions .",
    "the method can be easily generalized to other types of tns , e.g. , sbs  @xcite and peps .",
    "@xcite the many - particle wave functions of one dimensional periodic systems with @xmath7 sites , can be written in the mps@xcite , i.e. , @xmath8 where , @xmath9 is the dimension of the physical indices @xmath10 , and for fixed physical index @xmath10 , @xmath11 are @xmath12 matrices on site @xmath13 , where @xmath2 is the schmidt cut - off . given a hamiltonian @xmath14 for a system , the total energy of this system is a function of the tensors at each lattice site @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "the main task is to find the ground state wave function and its energy , that is , to find the global minimum of the function @xmath16 and the corresponding value of @xmath11 .",
    "this problem can be mapped to optimizing the total energy of a classical mechanical system , in which the elements of the tensor @xmath17 are treated as the generalized coordinates of the system .",
    "we introduce the lagrangian of the _ artificial _ system , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the artificial mass of the `` particles '' , and we use @xmath19=1 in all the simulations .",
    "@xmath20 is the velocity of corresponding matrix @xmath11 defined on each lattice site .",
    "the norm of matrix @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22^ * [ \\dot{a}_{ij}^{s_k}(k ) ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the velocity corresponding to @xmath24 which is the elements of @xmath11 .",
    "we therefore have the euler - lagrange equation ( we drop the site index @xmath13 for simplicity ) , @xmath25 which leads to , @xmath26 the energy and its derivative respect to given @xmath27 can be easily calculated by mc sampling the physical configuration space .",
    "@xcite since the mc sampling method for tns has been described in details in refs .",
    "[ ] , we shall not repeat it here .",

    "@xcite when the temperature approaches zero , both @xmath35 and @xmath36 also approach zero , we then obtain the minimum of @xmath16 , i.e. , the ground state energy of the quantum system , and corresponding wave function . when temperature @xmath31 is sufficiently low , the system can be approximated as harmonic oscillations around their equilibrium positions , and therefore , according to the classical statistics the total energy of the system is @xmath37 .",
    "we can run the md simulation at a given temperature through exchanging energies with a heat bath .",
    "since we are not interested in the real `` dynamics '' of the system , one can use the simplest velocity rescaling thermostat : in order to fix the temperature at @xmath31 , we rescale the velocity @xmath38 by a factor @xmath39 at each md step , where @xmath40 is the instantaneous temperature defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : temperature ] ) .",
    "note that when scaling a tensor @xmath32 to @xmath41 , the energy of the system @xmath42 remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , we normalize the tensors by dividing them the largest absolute value of the elements of each tensor after each md step , to keep the temperature well defined . furthermore , any change of the tensor @xmath32 that is parallel to @xmath32 during the md steps have no contribution to the energy . to improve the efficiency ,",
    "we orthogonalize the velocity @xmath43 to @xmath32 at each md step before we rescaling the velocity to the given temperature , @xmath44 where the inner product of two matrices is defined as , @xmath45    usually the ground state energy of a simple system can be obtained by a simulated annealing method , i.e. , one starts from a high temperature of the system , and gradually decreases the temperature to zero .",
    "if the temperature cooling is sufficiently slow , in principle one should get the _",
    "global _ minimum of the system . however , since the energy is highly non - linear function of the tensors , and for frustrated physical models , which have many metastable states , in practice , it often easily be trapped in some local minima .    here",
    ", we adopt the replica exchange ( also known as parallel tempering )  @xcite md method , which simulates @xmath46 replicas simultaneously , and each at a different temperature @xmath47 covering a range of interest , to avoid being stuck in local minima .",
    "each replica runs independently , except after certain steps the configuration can be exchanged between neighboring temperatures , according to the metropolis criterion , @xmath48 where @xmath49 in which @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the _ average _ energies of the @xmath52th and the @xmath53-th replica in a range of certain md steps .",
    "the inclusion of high-@xmath31 configurations ensures that the lower temperature systems can access a broader phase space and avoid being trapped in local minima . during the simulation , we keep the highest temperature @xmath54 and lowest temperature @xmath55 fixed , whereas the rest temperatures distribute exponentially between the highest and lowest temperatures at the start of simulation . during the simulation , the temperatures ( except @xmath54 and @xmath55 )",
    "are adjusted to ensure that the exchange rates between the replica are roughly equal.@xcite    the lower the minimal temperature @xmath56 , the more accurate the results one can obtain . in principle , @xmath56 has to approach zero to get the real ground state .",
    "however , decrease the @xmath56 will increase the computational cost ( the number of replica temperatures ) .",
    "instead , one could continue to lower the temperature sequentially to a desired low temperature , or adopt a local minimizer ( e.g. , conjugate gradient method ) after we finish the replica exchange md simulations , to get more accurate ground state .",
    "it is worth noting that a direct use of monte carlo method instead of md to update the tensors themselves ( i.e. , one directly change the tensor elements according to the metropolis criterion for the total energy ) are not applicable for the scheme .",
    "the reason is that the energy obtained from mc sampling is not bounded from below .",
    "therefore , it is very easy to be trapped in a _ false _ energy minimum ( i.e. , the energy minimum due to inadequate mc sampling , which may be much lower than the real energy of the system ) , especially if the sampling is not large enough , if a monte carlo updating method is used .",
    "in contrast , the md method does not suffer from this problem .",
    "in this section , we present the benchmark tests of our scheme on one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model and two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0-@xmath1 model . since 1d model has been well studied and has many efficient schemes , we simply present the results without detailed discussion .",
    "we discuss more detailed features of the scheme for the 2d model .",
    "to test our scheme , we compute the ground state energy of the 1d hubbard model,@xcite @xmath57 to simulate the 1d hubbard model , we first transform it to a spin model via jodran - wigner transformation .",
    "the many - particle wave function of the ground state of the corresponding spin model is presented by a mps .",
    "we optimize the energy using the replica exchange md method described in the method section .",
    "we use 48 temperatures , with the highest temperature @xmath58=10@xmath59 , and lowest temperature @xmath60=10@xmath61 . the md time step @xmath62=0.5 . during the replica exchange",
    "md , we use 3000@xmath63 mc ( each spin flip is considered a mc sampling ) samplings per md step , where @xmath64 is the length of the hubbard chain .",
    "we further cool down the temperature sequentially to 10@xmath65 to get more accurate ground state energy , after the replica exchange md simulation .",
    "the number of mc sampling to calculate the final total energy is 50000@xmath63 .",
    "we compare our results to those obtained from the exact diagonalization method in table [ tab : hubbard ] , for a @xmath64=14 sites , half - filling fermion hubbard model , with pbc , for various @xmath66 parameters .",
    "we take schmidt cut - off @xmath2=6 - 14 for the mps . as one",

    "the two types of sbs satisfy both area law  @xcite and size - consistency .",
    "@xcite        in our simulations , we use @xmath46=96 temperatures .",
    "initially , the temperatures distribute exponentially between the highest ( @xmath54 ) and lowest ( @xmath55 ) temperatures . for each temperature , we start from random tensors . during the simulations , we adjust the temperatures after configuration exchange for 10 times , whereas there are 300 md steps between the two configuration exchanges , with a step length @xmath62=0.01 . when sampling the spin configurations , we enforce @xmath81=0 .",
    "for each md step , we sample about 10000 spin configurations .",
    "the energies used for temperature exchange are averaged over 300 md steps .",

    "it can be seen that in all cases the ground state energies optimized by replica - md method are improved from the ones obtained using the original optimization method .",
    "for some points , especially in the strong frustration region , the improvement is significant .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the md optimization scheme developed in this work can apply not only to the mps and sbs types of tns , but also to more general tns , e.g. , peps with some modification .",
