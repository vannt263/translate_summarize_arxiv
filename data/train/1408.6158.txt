    "the importance of accurate knowledge of nuclear masses is not disputed by anybody .",
    "unprecedented numbers of precise measurements are available @xcite , but many particle stable masses are still unknown .",
    "the masses are collected in comprehensive mass tables @xcite which also contain estimates based on smooth extra / interpolations and consistency between a number of related particle and cluster separation energies .",
    "different types of theoretical models are also used to estimate and predict nuclear masses of interest .",
    "they are almost all at some point employing phenomenological parametrization .",
    "the original example is the semi - classical mass formula by von weizcker and bethe @xcite , where four parameters are fitted to known masses and all others can be predicted .",
    "much more sophisticated versions are developed where the same idea of expanding in terms of neutron and proton numbers systematically is exploited in the liquid droplet model @xcite .",
    "the success of the liquid drop models is due to the overall continuous behaviour of nuclear masses as function of neutron and proton numbers , and of course on the inclusion of the correct physics ingredients of volume , surface , coulomb and symmetry terms .",
    "after the bulk part of the nuclear masses are described the smaller contributions are highlighted as the remaining part .",
    "this is much more difficult to describe as the origin is in a number of very different correlations expressed as e.g. shell effects , deformations , and pairing .",
    "these three correlations occur rather systematically and can to some degree be accounted for in the droplet models . however , the severe limitation is that predictions beyond the experimentally known regions quickly become rather inaccurate .",
    "improvement in predictive power is obtained by microscopic mean - field models , i.e. hartee - fock - boguliubov , density functional theory and thomas - fermi calculations @xcite .",
    "now the phenomenology enters as the nucleon - nucleon interactions used as input , and determined from general symmetry principles and by fitting to resulting computed properties . here",
    "the self - consistency is necessary to have reliability beyond the fitted regions . at some level the liquid drop bulk properties",
    "must be reproduced if these models are to be successful .",
    "this is more directly exploited in the micro - macro models where the microscopic fluctuating part first is extracted from a mean - field shell model computation and the average smooth part is replaced by liquid drop expressions @xcite .",
    "the origin of nuclear masses is the nucleon - nucleon interaction which implies that the different nuclei have ( perhaps complicated ) related masses .",
    "this is explored in ab initio calculations of nuclear masses from the basic interaction @xcite .",
    "it is exploited in a completely different way in a series of so - called mass relations where garvey - kelson is the most well - known @xcite .",
    "it is based on counting the number of pairwise interactions in different nuclei and by adding for example three mass difference between two nuclei , the result should be zero .",
    "this is tested to be true for known masses with an average accuracy of about 500  kev @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to test whether the previous mass formulae obey the rather accurate garvey - kelson mass relations .",
    "this turns out to be essentially true for the measured masses , but as soon as extrapolations are involved the accuracy drops by about a factor of two @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology is only really trustworthy within the fitted region .",
    "there is apparently one exception in the duflo - zuker mass formulae constructed from the same principles as the garvey - kelson mass relations @xcite .",
    "a different principle was used in extraction of pairing properties where emphasis rather than cancellation is desired .",
    "odd - even mass differences between neighbouring nuclei already reveal these effects .",
    "an improvement is obtained in the slightly more complicated combination where an average of the two neighbouring mass differences is used @xcite . a further extension to include more masses led jensen et al .",
    "@xcite to formulate mass relations obeying a general principle of cancellation of all smooth terms up to any desired order .",
    "the practical choice is second order , since the necessary nuclei otherwise may differ too much .",
    "it is interesting to note that garvey - kelson relations also eliminate all smooth terms up to second order .",
    "although never emphasized previously , this is obviously a convincing reason for their success .",
    "different mass combinations can now be chosen to either emphasize specific correlations or to avoid them for example by cancellation .",
    "the latter choice produces a combination of masses equal to zero , which means any of these masses can be expressed as a linear combination of the other ones .",
    "thus , if correct such mass relations are directly applicable for one - step extrapolations beyond known mass regions .",
    "similar extrapolations can be made with garvey - kelson mass relations but they do not allow special choices where for example odd - even effects a priori are absent or emphasized .",
    "other correlations could be investigated as well if a mass combination can be found to highlight them .",
    "it has been suggested that nuclear masses have a component of chaotic behaviour amounting to @xmath3  mev @xcite which amounts to between @xmath2 and @xmath4  mev .",
    "this seems to be an exaggeration as suggested by the observation that specific regions exhibit ( unknown ) correlations @xcite accounting for maybe half of this amount .",
    "this is also indicated by the rather small root mean square deviation of less than @xmath5  kev obtained by the @xmath6 point garvey - kelson mass interpolation @xcite .",
    "thus , any mass extrapolation can ultimately only meaningfully aim for an accuracy of at most @xmath7  kev with global mass formulae .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present four linear mass relations between isotopes capable of removing smoothly varying contributions . when applied to isotopes with measured binding energies",
    ", these mass combinations should have a tendency to cancel completely barring influences from other significant contributing factors . expressing unknown masses as linear combinations of known ones",

    "the relatively few assumptions needed to establish the fundamental model is the greatest advantage of the method . as a result",

    "the idea behind the mass relations is that the nuclear many - body systems all are derived from the same basic interactions , and hence different nuclei should have related binding energies .",
    "various principles are applied for different mass relations .",
    "we shall focus on one type where we first describe the general principles , then we derive some useful properties , and finally we specify the applications in the last subsection .",
    "the mass formula is often divided into a sum of three different types of terms . first the dominating term , @xmath8 , describing the smoothly varying gross properties of the binding energy as function of neutron and proton numbers , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is the liquid drop , or droplet , model with the classical four terms , that is volume- , surface- , coulomb- and symmetry - energy .",
    "the specific form and the precise numerical values are not important since the smooth character is only necessary to eliminate unwanted contributions .",
    "this is achieved through suitable linear combinations of the nuclear binding energies as elaborated in sect .",
    "( [ sect . manipulating ] ) .",
    "second , a term accounting for shell effects , @xmath11 , arising from quantum mechanical correlations favouring special ( spherical ) configurations .",
    "third , a term , @xmath12 , describing systematic but not smoothly varying contributions to the binding energy . this can be odd - even and other similar ( short - ranged ) correlation effects . in total",
    ", we have the binding energy separated into such distinct terms , where each is a function of the nucleon numbers @xmath9 , and @xmath10 : @xmath13 explicit addition of terms describing other effects , for instance the possible tendency to form @xmath14-particles within nuclei , could also be included . however , the possible nature of @xmath14-clusters is presently not our prime focus , and furthermore the energy gain from these clusters are also very small or possibly very smoothly varying @xcite .",
    "since the existence of both neutron and proton shells is undeniable , the second term , @xmath11 , is an inescapable necessity .",
    "the major shells are prominent only in relatively narrow regions of nucleon numbers . a slowly varying contribution from @xmath15 between shells",
    "can then essentially be eliminated by the same procedure as @xmath8 .",

    "the systematic third term , @xmath12 , is more complicated since it is composed of several effects .",
    "it includes three different pairing effects , along with the wigner term related to the isospin symmetry , all of which are more subtle in nature than the smooth term .",
    "however , they are all smooth functions of nucleon numbers provided isotopes with same parity are compared and the @xmath16 line is not crossed .",
    "we shall in this paper impose these restrictions on the employed extrapolations , although we expect to encounter occasional signals of these terms .",
    "the terms in eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) do not necessarily constitute a complete expression for the binding energy .",
    "additional overlooked or unknown effects might also contribute in different ways .",
    "however , we expect that any such neglected but significant effects will produce a clear deviation from the systematic results , and thereby reveal itself .",

    "a flexible method to manipulate binding energies was discussed in @xcite with the aim of isolating specific contributing effects .",
    "a possibility is then to study individual effects in relative isolation .",
    "however , this flexibility also indirectly enables the extrapolation of unknown binding energies . the idea is to combine separation energies in a manner reminiscent of a second order difference . @xmath17",
    "the separation energy of @xmath18 neutrons and @xmath19 protons in any isotope is given as a difference between binding energies . @xmath20 calculating @xmath21 using eqs .",
    "( [ b ] ) and ( [ s ] ) results in an expression for @xmath21 , which like the original expression for @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) , can be separated in three terms , i.e. @xmath23    depending on the chosen @xmath24 , some terms will be diminished while others will be emphasized .",
    "the contributions from the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ qs ] ) vary greatly in size depending on the chosen @xmath24 , but common for all configurations is the fact that the smooth terms are almost completely eliminated . interpreting the discrete variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 as global , continuous variables automatically results in an elimination up to and including the second order in the taylor expansion of the smooth terms around @xmath25 .",
    "the leading order contribution to continuous functions , @xmath26 and @xmath27 analogous to @xmath22 and @xmath21 , is then third order in the taylor expansion , that is @xmath28 as seen by direct expansion .",
    "this remaining contribution will always be present for smooth functions when mass relations based on eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) are constructed .",
    "it either has to be corrected for or included in accuracy estimates .    by severe reduction of the smooth contributions to a size like in eq .",
    "( [ 3orde ] ) other effects would stand out .",
    "desired effects can then be emphasized by suitably chosen configurations @xmath29 . the shell effect in particular will figure prominently in certain parts of the nuclear chart , and the validity of some extrapolations in these areas will therefore be more doubtful . however , lacking an accurate expression for the general contributions from shell effects , it is difficult to construct appropriately corrected mass relations .",
    "also any expression describing shell effects would be another source of error in the extrapolations .",
    "thus , we shall not attempt to account for the shell effects , although perhaps detect their presence by observing systematic deviations .    instead of the separation energies in eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) we can use similar combinations arising from @xmath0 values , that is for @xmath30 @xmath31 the advantage is that @xmath0 sometimes is much more accurately known than nuclear masses themselves , and this is especially pronounced for super - heavy nuclei .",
    "this observation is very well established by the experimental techniques where masses are measured relative to other masses .",
    "then it is possible to use eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) with @xmath0 values , which leads to @xmath32 other types of conclusions may then become possible from @xmath0 relations , as , in addition to the better accuracy , only three measured values enters eq .",
    "( [ qalph ] ) in contrast to the four terms arising from eqs .",
    "( [ q ] ) and ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the aim is to find a reliable extrapolation of binding energies through the mass relations in sect .",
    "( [ sect . manipulating ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished by carefully choosing the configuration in eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) such that the result ideally is zero .",
    "if in a certain area of the nuclear chart , limited only by the available measured isotopes , a mass relation is prone to return the value zero , it is reasonable to assume this tendency would continue beyond the known isotopes .",
    "unknown binding energies can then be calculated directly from a given mass relation . however , such extrapolation is only reliable if the chosen mass relation in fact eliminates all contributions from the binding energy in eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "even then care has to be taken to avoid outlandish results .",
    "many mass formulas have a tendency to deviate significantly when extrapolating outside the experimentally known region @xcite .",
    "the present method does not rely on a specific form of a mass formula .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ q ] ) allows for an endless number of possible mass relations by choosing @xmath33 accordingly , and using too great values for @xmath34 and @xmath35 would make the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) as a derivative less accurate .",
    "the likelihood of combining different effects in the result increases when combining isotopes farther apart , and the extrapolation would also be less accurate . similarly , the mass relation could be chosen to eliminate the smooth parts to any order desired .",
    "unfortunately , this would also come at the expense of reliability since isotopes farther apart would be required .",
    "we therefore only apply mass relations where @xmath34 and @xmath35 never are larger than 2 . furthermore , to avoid the quickly varying pairing contribution",
    ", we choose to compare nuclei of the same odd - even character . in total",
    "we use here four mass relations where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "they combine nuclei with fixed @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively , that is defined by @xmath40 the actual nuclei in these four mass relations can be seen in fig .",
    "[ structures.pdf ] where the original six nuclei from eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) and ( [ s ] ) reduce to only four with different weights .",
    "these four mass relations should , ideally , completely eliminate any contributions from pairing effects . of course",
    ", the actual results will not be so idealized , and will at the very least include remnants of the smooth term .",
    "some minor pairing contribution might still remain , since no systematic theory can account for all these effects as discussed by friedman _",

    "the weights assigned to the different isotopes reflect the concatenation of the six terms from eqs .",
    "( [ q ] ) and ( [ s ] ) into four .",
    "[ structures.pdf ] ]",
    "the actual analysis is divided into two subsections .",
    "first the results are examined individually from applying the four mass relations to the available measurements of binding energies .",
    "the tendencies are discussed to emphasize the relevant structures and provide insight into the viability of the general method .",
    "the areas accessible to the mass relations will also be determined in the process .",
    "the measurements are from audi and meng @xcite for isotopes in their ground state with nucleon number , @xmath41 , spanning @xmath42 .",
    "second , the mass relations are applied to @xmath0 values with the purpose of analysing general structures found among the super - heavy elements .",
    "the measurements of @xmath0 are also from audi and meng @xcite , unfortunately , they are not necessarily of isotopes in their ground state .      the general method described in sect .  ( [ sec .",
    "cal mass ] ) is idealized , and constitutes the simplest and most obvious way to perform the extrapolations .",
    "however , a slightly more complicated procedure is applied to increase accuracy and estimate uncertainty .",
    "the fundamental idea is still to combine four different isotopes either horizontally , vertically , or diagonally .",
    "first the mass relation is tested locally , that is with @xmath43 as the example and @xmath44 as the unknown we compute @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "each would be zero if the mass relation is exactly obeyed .",
    "a systematic tendency in the region can be accounted for by computing the non - zero average value which is used for @xmath48 in the prediction of the unknown @xmath44 binding energy . obviously , a systematic tendency is then accounted for in the prediction which furthermore now has an extrapolation uncertainty attached from the spread around the average value of the mass relation .    with the diagonal relations ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) it is impossible to calculate an average based on three preceding values .",
    "this would reduce the available extrapolations almost to none .",
    "instead only the immediately preceding value is used for @xmath49 .",
    "the uncertainties of the actual extrapolations have two general sources .",
    "the uncertainties in the measurements combine with the uncertainty of the predicted ( non - zero ) average value . since this expected average is based on three different , but overlapping applications of the mass relation , this statistical error is the combination of six different uncertainties in measurements . depending on the specific isotopes , and",
    "how well they have been measured , this uncertainty can at times be very significant .",
    "recently , it has been suggested by olofsson _ et al_.  @xcite that the distribution of binding energies inherently is , at least partly , chaotic in nature .",
    "this is still subject to discussion as molinari and weidenmller @xcite interpret the results as being due to residual interactions in the shell model .",
    "however , to account for any ( chaotic ) fluctuations the variation of the average value , computed from the three mass combinations , must be included in the final uncertainty of the extrapolated value .    to achieve this",
    "we combine the two different contributions to the uncertainty , that is from measurement and average .",
    "thus , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 labels the applied relation , @xmath53 is the extrapolated value , @xmath54 is the measurement uncertainty , @xmath55 is the variation , and @xmath56 is the final uncertainty of the extrapolation .",
    "the applicability of this extrapolation method has limits , and some energies can not be meaningfully extrapolated .",
    "consequently , only results where @xmath57 are included , since otherwise the extrapolated values are too uncertain to be of interest .",
    "we now proceed to investigate the systematic behaviour of the mass relations .",
    "the results from all four mass relations are shown in figs .",
    "lige ] and [ fig .",
    "the most prominent visible features arise from the shell effects around the more or less magic numbers .",
    "whenever a shell crossing is involved , a significant deviation from the surrounding binding energies appear .",
    "how the mass relation is positioned relative to the shell defines both the sign and the scale of this deviation .",
    "consequently , because the binding is amplified by the @xmath58 coefficient on the @xmath59 value ( see fig .",
    "[ structures.pdf ] ) , a mass relation computed for a magic number @xmath59 must be significantly greater than for neighbouring isotopes .",
    "a mass relation centred one or possibly even two nucleons before a shell should also have a noticeably greater outcome , though not to the same extent . similarly",
    ", a relation centred two or three nucleons after a shell would have a noticeably smaller outcome , since the @xmath60 coefficient in the relation would be closer to the shell and would therefore dominate over the @xmath58 contribution .",
    "if the relation was centred just after a magic number the @xmath60 and @xmath58 coefficients would probably cancel , and the result might appear as if unaffected by shells altogether .",
    "generally , it is tempting to assume that the extrapolations will be more exact in regions with heavier isotopes , where changes from isotope to isotope are more gradual .",
    "if the changes are more gradual , the expected outcome should presumably be more reliable , as the binding energies themselves would fluctuate less .",
    "this can also be reflected in the attached uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath61 relations are shown in fig .",
    "they only combine nuclear masses horizontally and vertically in the @xmath39 diagram .",
    "they are therefore well suited for extrapolations beyond neutron and proton drip lines , but less well suited for the narrow strips of super - heavy elements .",
    "these two mass relations are also only sensitive to their own type of shell effects as seen in the figures .",
    "this confirms again the almost independence of neutron and proton shell fillings .",
    "the very light isotopes have been omitted , because they disrupted the energy scale and made minor energy changes less obvious .",
    "their binding energies and structure are in any case strongly varying and any meaningful extrapolation would be close to impossible .",
    "the most prominent features in the @xmath61 relation on fig .",
    "lige ] are the shells at @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , but also the shell at @xmath64 is clearly visible .",
    "the trace of these shells extend over numbers corresponding to the range of the mass relations .",
    "as expected the influence is positive below and negative above the shells .",
    "this symmetry extends to both sides of a shell , and is reflected in the size as well .",
    "the absolute values at the shells vary , but is always greater than @xmath65 and often @xmath66 . the results for @xmath59 and @xmath67 , when located at the shell , are nearly identical with opposite sign , which again demonstrates the symmetry of the shell effect .",
    "it is also interesting to note how neutron shells only are visible with @xmath61 at a proton shell , otherwise the mass relation is very small .",
    "this emphasizes how exclusively @xmath61 is concerned with effects relating to protons .",
    "the neutron and proton shells are to a large extent , away from drip lines , filled independently .",
    "the region around @xmath68 where @xmath69 , shows many characteristics otherwise found in shells .",
    "there is an increase in energy just before @xmath68 and a decrease in energy afterwards , with a slight fluctuation at @xmath68 , which is similar to the shell at @xmath70 .",
    "the energy changes are less pronounced than for other shells and the energy changes are also less well - defined . nevertheless , the general smooth behaviour in the region is clearly disrupted , and the result is compatible with @xmath68 as the most prominent subshell .",
    "overall , the @xmath61 relation has away from shells , a very pronounced tendency to more or less vanish .",
    "in particular , the region beyond the @xmath62 shell is smooth and typically less than @xmath71 numerically .",
    "extrapolations from this region should then be very reliable .",
    "this claim will be carefully investigated in sect .",
    "( [ sec . com",
    ". res . ] ) , where we also compare to extrapolations from other mass relations .    the results in fig .",
    "lige ] from @xmath43 are incredibly similar in most regards to the results for @xmath61 . the same tendency to complete cancellation",
    "is observed , though the remains are typically less than @xmath72 when evaluated numerically .",
    "actually , every visible feature appears more distinctly .",
    "the shells at @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are not only obvious , they are sharply defined and confined to the area immediately surrounding the shells .",
    "the symmetry around the shell itself is also still present , and it is as clear as for protons .",
    "the size of the shell deviations are @xmath75 , again very much comparable to the @xmath61 results .",
    "more interesting is the region around @xmath76 , where once again a deviation is visible .",
    "the same region where the @xmath68 subshell was visible with @xmath61 now shows a deviation with @xmath43 .",
    "this is particularly interesting considering that none of the major proton shells are visible away from a neutron shell , which suggest that this is not solely a shell effect .",
    "the deviation has some similarities with the other shells , but it is still decisively different from an ordinary shell .",
    "most strikingly , the energy first increases , then decreases , and then increases again , which again suggests that this effect arises from a more complicated structure than a regular shell effect .    as an example of the possible use of these mass relations we look into this mass region in a little more details .",
    "the figs .",
    "[ fig . lige]a and [ fig .",
    "lige]b clearly show shell structures around @xmath77 .",
    "first , the neutron shell at @xmath78 is less prominent than the well established major shells , but nevertheless unmistakingly recognized by the mass relations deviating from zero .",
    "this observation of a neutron subshell for @xmath79 is discussed in @xcite .    these shells for @xmath80 and @xmath78",
    "do not extend through all the known isotopes . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the structure is absent for @xmath81 , and present for @xmath82 . for @xmath78 , the structure is absent for @xmath83 , and present for @xmath84 .",
    "the explanations can be found by inspecting the fillings of the corresponding neutron and proton shells . for nucleon numbers between @xmath85 and @xmath86 ,",
    "the @xmath87 shell is only partly occupied .",
    "adding more nucleons require occupation of other shells , that is @xmath88 and possibly @xmath89 .",
    "then the neutron shell at @xmath78 disappears when @xmath10 increases beyond @xmath90 .",
    "this is precisely when at least 4 protons occupy the @xmath87 shell which therefore wants to deform to avoid the degeneracy .",
    "the neutron shell is not sufficiently strong to prevent this deformation . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the proton shell is only visible for @xmath9 larger than @xmath91 , which is when the rather close - lying @xmath92 and @xmath93 levels begin to be occupied .",
    "the gain in neutron deformation energy is not sufficient to overcome the rather strong spherical proton shell effect .",
    "the reason is that the neutron single - particle level density only changes relatively little with modest deformation .",
    "the results from using the diagonal relations for @xmath50 and @xmath49 are presented in fig .",
    "the @xmath50 relation is oriented diagonally towards the heavy isotopes in the chart of nuclides .",
    "it should therefore be able to extrapolate to heavier isotopes than any of the other mass relation .",
    "unfortunately , this orientation also rather strongly confines it to the isotopes at the heavy end of known isotopes .",
    "the shells are again very pronounced , but now all the structures from both @xmath61 and @xmath43 appear in @xmath50 .",
    "it is interesting to notice how the neutron shells are more sharply defined than the proton shells , as it also appeared when comparing the results of @xmath61 and @xmath43 .",
    "not surprisingly , the deviation around @xmath76 is even more prominent here , but also the area around @xmath94 shows a rather strong deviation from zero .",
    "this deviation could also be detected with @xmath43 , albeit more faintly , but it was almost invisible with @xmath61 .",
    "a clear and significant effect in this mass region is therefore somewhat surprising , but it demonstrates how well @xmath50 detects the more elusive tendencies .",
    "as @xmath50 includes more effects than @xmath61 and @xmath43 , the results also vary much more .",
    "the reliability of any extrapolated result might therefore be questionable .",
    "this objection is legitimate for extrapolations involving several different shells .",
    "however , away from shells the fluctuations around zero are generally less than @xmath95 .",
    "in particular , a promising mass region with smooth behaviour is @xmath96 and @xmath97 . for heavy or super - heavy isotopes",
    "the results should be as reliable as with @xmath61 or @xmath43 at the drip lines .",
    "this suggests interesting extrapolations with @xmath50 in the less accessible region of heavy or super - heavy nuclei .",
    "finally , the other diagonal relation , @xmath49 , is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig . dia ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is oriented perpendicular to the rather narrow strip of measured masses .",

    "the specific state , in particular , among the super - heavy isotopes are usually unknown",

    "a single mass relation can not be expected to provide perfect predictions , because of the fluctuating , possibly chaotic , nature of the binding energy . however , if a particular isotope could be approached from several different directions , the expected fluctuations could be viewed from several sides , which would provide a clearer image of the given isotope . in other words , if an isotope could be extrapolated by several different mass relations , the results could be examined and used either to select the most accurate of the extrapolations or combined to provide a much more reliable estimate of the binding energy .    comparing different extrapolations",

    "lige ] and [ fig .",
    "these results are marked with a * symbol in table  [ tab .",

    "the marked extrapolations are then excluded , and a new , more plausible , average is calculated .",

    "the extrapolations may be incompatible as in the neighbourhood of closed shells or by crossing the @xmath16 line .",
    "then a meaningful uncertainty is defined as @xmath111 , where @xmath53 only includes the extrapolations used in the final calculation of @xmath106 . as a consequence of this procedure",
    "some results might be based on a single extrapolation , even though multiple mass relations have estimated the isotope .",
    "the other available extrapolations could for instance involve a shell crossing , and would then be discarded if the initial results were incompatible .",
    "actually , some isotopes , which have been estimated by several mass relations , might not have a meaningful resulting average at all , if all the extrapolations had an uncertainty exceeding 500 kev .",

    "some results , notably in this area , were influenced by shell effects , and should be handled with care , but generally the calculated averages seemed to be reliable .",
    "ten isotopes estimated by combining extrapolations were measured after audi and meng complied their initial information .",
    "this allowed for a direct evaluation of the accuracy of the method .",
    "the values for most extrapolations corresponded very well to the extrapolations .",
    "those that deviated significantly were all in the vicinity of shells or subshells , and the inaccuracy of the method in such areas is not surprising , as no attempt has been made to account for these effects . on the contrary , it is more surprising that the extrapolation of @xmath217i is so accurate as this isotope is also close to shells .",
    "the greatest fundamental weakness with the presented method is the use of somewhat removed isotopes .",
    "isotopes are combined over a significant distance , particularly when calculating the variation in the tendencies . combining isotopes over a greater distance increases the likelihood of combining unrelated effects .",
    "it is difficult to account for the effect of one isotope being influenced differently than the others in the extrapolation .",
    "the usual approach has been to apply more compact mass relations .",
    "beginning with the garvey - kelson mass relations , this fear of combining unrelated effects has been an ongoing concern . however , despite the rather large span of the mass relations used here , the results are comparable to the best of other available extrapolations .",
    "although , applying other , possibly more compact , mass relations would be the most obvious way to supplement the results . by combining results from multiple mass relations , and not just the four applied here , this method also allows for convenient extensions and improvements . applying more complex mass relations , could possibly increase the applicability of this method even more . by creating a comprehensive system of extrapolations based on different relations it would probably be possible to determine binding energies with still greater precision , and in greater number .",
    "the actual binding energy would be approached from many directions by several mass relations , and the final result would be all the more credible .    even though the extrapolated binding energies might not be perfectly consistent , the calculated averages should still be very viable and useful estimates .",
    "in particular , results for isotopes unencumbered by shell effects and the like should be more than reliable .    finally , from the evaluations of @xmath21-values along the stability line it was possible to examine general structures in the binding energy of super - heavy isotopes . here",
    "signature of a minor neutron shell at @xmath232 was found . applying the mass relation perpendicular to the stability curve",
    "the behaviour across this neutron number was found to be characteristic of a closed shell .",
    "these findings very clearly suggests there exists a minor neutron shell at @xmath1 .",
    "it is also striking that no other shell is revealed in this region which owes its very existence to stability provided by shell effects .    in conclusion ,",
    "simple four - nucleus mass relations , where smooth contributions to the nuclear binding energy vanish to second order , are used to extrapolate unknown nuclear binding energies with rather good accuracy .",
    "we provide estimates for a series of different nuclei just outside the region of knowledge where a good deal of present nuclear research activities are focussed .",
    "in particular , we apply the method to the super - heavy region where special @xmath21-values are measured very accurately ."
