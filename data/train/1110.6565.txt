    "this kind of neural coherence is also correlated with pathological rhythms associated with neural diseases ( e.g. , epileptic seizures and tremors in the parkinson s disease ) @xcite . here , we are interested in these coherent brain rhythms",
    ". a brain circuit is composed of a few types of excitatory principal cells and diverse types of inhibitory interneurons .",
    "interneuron diversity increases the computational power of principal cells @xcite .",
    "effect of chemical synapses on coherent brain rhythms has been much investigated in neural systems composed of excitatory and/or inhibitory neurons @xcite .",
    "historically , recurrent excitation between principal cells is the conventional coherence mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , when the decay time of the synaptic interaction is enough long , mutual inhibition between interneurons ( rather than excitation ) may synchronize individual neural firings @xcite . by providing a coherent oscillatory output to the principal cells ,",
    "interneuronal networks play the role of the backbones ( i.e. , pacemakers ) of many brain rhythms such as the thalamocortical spindle rhythms @xcite and the fast gamma rhythms in the hippocampus and the neocortex @xcite .",
    "when the feedback between the excitatory and the inhibitory populations is strong , neural coherence occurs via the `` cross - talk '' between the two populations @xcite . in these computational studies of neural coherence ,",
    "different types of network architectures have been considered @xcite ; all - to - all networks where every neuron is coupled to every other neuron , sparse random networks where synaptic connections are sparse , and complex networks such as small - world networks ( with predominantly local connections and rare long - distance connections ) @xcite and scale - free networks ( with a few percent of hub neurons with an exceptionally large number of connections ) @xcite .",
    "neurons in the neural system exhibit a variety of morphological and physiological properties .",
    "however , close to threshold , this remarkable richness may be grouped broadly into two basic types of excitability , often referred to as type i and type ii @xcite . when the strength of a constant input current passes a threshold , type - i neurons can fire at arbitrarily low frequencies and they can smoothly encode the strength of the input into the output firing frequency .",
    "in contrast , type - ii neurons have a non - zero minimum frequency of firing and they fire in a narrow frequency band which is relatively insensitive to changes in the strength of the applied current .",
    "different types of excitability occur because neurons have different bifurcations of resting and spiking states @xcite . for the type",
    "i neurons , oscillations emerge via a saddle - node bifurcation on an invariant circle . as the bifurcation parameter ( i.e. , strength of the injected current ) passes a threshold ,",
    "the stable and the unstable fixed points coalesce and then disappear , leaving a large - amplitude stable periodic orbit .",
    "this is a global bifurcation and the frequency of the global loop can be arbitrarily small .",
    "on the other hand , for type - ii neurons a transition from a resting state to a periodically spiking state occurs through a hopf bifurcations with a finite non - zero firing frequency .",
    "according to their bifurcations , neurons may also be classified into integrators and resonators @xcite .",
    "type - i neurons act as integrators without subthreshold oscillations , and they prefer high - frequency input : the higher the frequency of the input , the sooner they fire . in contrast ,",
    "type - ii neurons exhibit damped subthreshold oscillations and act as resonators : they prefer oscillatory input with the same frequency as that of damped oscillations . according to their excitability type , neurons make distinctly different responses to stimuli which have important implications for their distinct roles in generating population rhythms @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we study inhibitory coherence ( i.e. , collective coherence by synaptic inhibition ) in an ensemble of globally - coupled type - i neurons . neural models exhibiting the type-1 excitability include the connor model for the crab leg axons @xcite , the wang - buzsaki model for inhibitory interneurons @xcite , the hindmarsh - rose model @xcite , and the morris - lecar ( ml ) model @xcite under some circumstances . in section [ sec : he ] , we describe the biological conductance - based ml neuron model with voltage - gated ion channels .",
    "the ml neurons ( used in our study ) exhibit the type - i excitability , and they interact via inhibitory gabaergic synapses whose activity increases fast and decays slowly .",
    "inhibitory coherence ( which is our main concern ) is particularly important because it plays a significant role in integration of sensory and cognitive information ; for example , impaired inhibitory coherence is believed to be associated with schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to understand mechanisms for the emergence of inhibitory coherence . many works exploring mechanisms of neural coherence were done in neural systems composed of spontaneously firing ( i.e. , self - oscillating ) suprathreshold neurons ( above the threshold ) @xcite .",
    "for this case , neural coherence occurs via cooperation of regular firings of suprathreshold neurons . unlike the suprathreshold case , subthreshold neurons ( below the threshold )",
    "can not fire spontaneously without noise ; they can fire only with the help of noise .",
    "stochastic excitatory coherence ( i.e. , collective coherence between noise - induced spikings by synaptic excitation ) was observed in a population of excitatory subthreshold neurons @xcite . due to the stochastic excitatory coherence ,",
    "synaptic current , injected into each individual neuron , becomes temporally coherent .",
    "hence , temporal coherence resonance of an individual subthreshold neuron in the network may be enhanced .",
    "furthermore , stochastic inhibitory coherence ( i.e. , collective coherence between noise - induced spikings by synaptic inhibition ) was also investigated in a population of inhibitory subthreshold ml neurons exhibiting the type - ii excitability @xcite .",
    "weak stochastic inhibitory coherence was thus found to appear via cooperation of individual irregular oscillations ( i.e. , a regular small - amplitude ensemble - averaged oscillation emerges from sparsely synchronized neurons discharging irregularly at lower rates than the network oscillation ) .",
    "these sparsely synchronized neural oscillations have been intensively investigated in other types of neural networks @xcite and they are believed to be associated with cortical rhythms in cognition [ e.g. ultrafast rhythm ( 100 - 200 hz ) , gamma rhythm ( 30 - 100 hz ) and beta rhythm ( 15 - 30 hz ) ] with irregular and sparse neural discharges @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of subthreshold type - ii ml neurons , no stochastic inhibitory coherence is observed in a homogeneous population of subthreshold type - i ml neurons .",
    "hence , subthreshold type - i integrator neurons ( without subthreshold oscillations ) seem to be much more difficult to synchronize by inhibition than subthreshold type - ii resonator neurons ( exhibiting subthreshold oscillations ) . to take into consideration the effect of ( spontaneously firing ) suprathreshold neurons on the inhibitory coherence",
    ", we consider a heterogeneous inhibitory ensemble of subthreshold and suprathreshold type - i ml neurons .",
    "heterogeneity ( or diversity ) has been found to make constructive effects on collective coherence in various physical , biological , neural , and social systems @xcite . in section [ sec : ic ] , we investigate heterogeneity - induced inhibitory coherence by increasing the fraction of suprathreshold neurons @xmath0 in the whole population . as @xmath0 passes a threshold value",
    "@xmath1 suprathreshold neurons begin to synchronize and they play the role of coherent inhibitors for the emergence of inhibitory coherence in the whole heterogeneous population .",
    "thus , for @xmath3 the ensemble - averaged global potential @xmath4 exhibits a regular small - amplitude oscillation . for this coherent case , individual suprathreshold neurons exhibit intermittent spikings phase - locked to @xmath4 at random multiples of the period of @xmath4 . due to the stochastic spike skipping of suprathreshold neurons , the interspike interval ( isi )",
    "histogram has multiple peaks and partial occupation occurs in the raster plot of neural spikes .",
    "in addition to the coherent intermittent spikings , coherent subthreshold ( small - amplitude ) hopping oscillations also appear in the individual potentials of suprathreshold neurons .",
    "thus , sparsely synchronized suprathreshold neurons exhibit coherent mixed - mode oscillations with two well - separated frequencies , a fast subthreshold hopping frequency imposed by the collective network oscillation and a lower firing frequency of individual suprathreshold neurons . by virtue of their coherent inhibition",
    "sparsely synchronized suprathreshold neurons suppress noisy activities of subthreshold neurons .",
    "thus , only coherent fast subthreshold hopping oscillations ( without spikings ) appear in the individual potentials of subthreshold neurons .",
    "we also characterize this heterogeneity - induced inhibitory coherence in terms of `` statistical - mechanical '' spike - based and correlation - based measures , and find that the degree of inhibitory coherence increases as @xmath0 is increased from @xmath1 . in a real brain , each neuron",
    "is coupled to only a certain number of neurons which is much smaller than the total number of neurons .",
    "the effect of sparseness of synaptic connectivity on the inhibitory coherence is briefly discussed by varying the average number of synaptic inputs per neuron @xmath5 in a random network .",
    "emergence of inhibitory coherence is thus found to persist until @xmath5 is larger than a threshold value @xmath6 .",
    "we also confirm the universality of the heterogeneity - induced inhibitory coherence in a population of canonical type - i quadratic integrate - and - fire neurons @xcite .",
    "this kind of heterogeneity - induced weak inhibitory coherence might be associated with cortical rhythms with stochastic and sparse neural discharges which contribute to cognitive functions in the cerebral cortex ( e.g. , information integration , working memory , and selective attention ) @xcite .",

    "<S> we study inhibitory coherence ( i.e. , collective coherence by synaptic inhibition ) in an ensemble of globally - coupled type - i neurons which can fire at arbitrarily low frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> no inhibitory coherence is observed in a homogeneous ensemble composed of only subthreshold neurons ( which can not fire spontaneously without noise ) . by increasing the fraction of ( spontaneously firing ) suprathreshold neurons @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> heterogeneity - induced inhibitory coherence is investigated in a heterogeneous ensemble of subthreshold and suprathreshold neurons . as @xmath0 passes a threshold @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> suprathreshold neurons begin to synchronize and play the role of coherent inhibitors for the emergence of inhibitory coherence . </S>",
    "<S> thus , regularly - oscillating ensemble - averaged global potential appears for @xmath2 . for this coherent case suprathreshold neurons exhibit </S>",
    "<S> coherent mixed - mode oscillations with a fast subthreshold ( small - amplitude ) hopping frequency and a lower spiking frequency . by virtue of their coherent inhibition , </S>",
    "<S> sparsely synchronized suprathreshold neurons suppress noisy activities of subthreshold neurons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , only coherent subthreshold hoppings appear in the individual potentials of subthreshold neurons . </S>",
    "<S> we also characterize the inhibitory coherence in terms of the `` statistical - mechanical '' spike - based and correlation - based measures and find that the degree of inhibitory coherence increases with increasing @xmath0 for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , effect of sparse randomness of synaptic connectivity on the inhibitory coherence and universality of the heterogeneity - induced inhibitory coherence are briefly discussed . </S>"
