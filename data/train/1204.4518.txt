    "a femtocell is a supplementary structure to a cellular network , implemented in areas where the signal from the base station ( bs ) can not properly reach the users , especially ones in indoor areas .",
    "the emerging broadband wireless systems use orthogonal frequency - division multiple access ( ofdma ) @xcite to avoid interference among users . due to the limited spectrum , allocating distinct sub - channels to all users in both macrocell and femtocells must be an inefficient way for interference management between macro - femtocells .    in order to increase the spectrum efficiency , a common approach is to allow the femtocells to reuse the frequency band of the macrocell . a known interference issue when power control is applied to compensate pathloss of signal transmitted to a user at the cell edge is described as follows@xcite . in downlink , this problem occurs when a macro user ( m - ue ) is located nearby a femto - user ( f - ue ) located at the cell edge of femtocell so that femto - bs ( f - bs ) has to raise the transmit power to reach this far f - ue , resulting in interference from the f - bs to the m - ue .",
    "several strategies have been proposed to cope with interference problem in femtocell systems .",
    "this letter discusses two strategies that utilize fading fluctuations in frequency domain , i.e. opportunistic resource allocation ( ora)@xcite and interference alignment ( ia)@xcite-@xcite . in ora , with the variation of fading across different sub - channels , the system needs to find an appropriate sub - channel for a femtocell user , for which this user has a high received power from his bs and less interference from the macrocell transmission on the same sub - channel , such that total sum - rate is maximized . on the other hand",
    ", ia utilizes fading fluctuations in frequency domain to generate pre - coding vectors which create interference - free channels ( degrees of freedom ) .",
    "however , although sub - channels are assigned to users in the way that each user can gain the best signal from fading fluctuation , interference among users sharing the same resource is a key factor of system performance degradation . on the other hand , although ia utilizes frequency fading in order to create interference - free degrees of freedom , the fading fluctuations in this case are somehow averaged , thus suppressing the effect of favorable fading@xcite .    the different mechanisms behind ora or ia , lead to the question which one is the best to be applied to utilize the limited spectrum resources in order to to maximize the system performance .",
    "this letter aims to investigate the trade - off between ora and ia in the femtocell scenarios . here",
    ", the available sub - channels are divided into two groups , i.e. ora group and ia group , and the number of sub - channels allocated to ora group is defined as _ trade - off number _ between ora and ia . by investigating this trade - off , we found that , in low snr regime , the highest sum - rate can be achieved when most of sub - channels are allocated to perform ora . on the other hand ,",
    "when snr is high , sub - channels are mostly allocated to perform ia in order to maximize the sum - rate .",
    "we consider a cellular network consisting of two femtocells within a macrocell as shown in fig .",
    "[ sysmodel ] .",
    "the frequency band in the macrocell is divided into sub - channels based on ofdma and all sub - channels are reused by the femtocells .",
    "only macro - femto interference is assumed , femto - femto interference is neglected@xcite .",
    "here , each femtocell , as well as the macrocell , contains @xmath0 and @xmath1 users uniformly located in their corresponding bs coverage respectively , and all users share @xmath2 sub - channels .",
    "we assume that each sub - channel can only be allocated to a single user in each cell , but one user can have several allocated channels . when all users perform ia , the number of sub - channels must be assigned as @xmath3 , as defined in @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we assign @xmath4 and @xmath5 to facilitate our analysis .",
    "channel between a transmitter and a receiver is based on i. i. d. rayleigh fading .",
    "we consider downlink transmissions only .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the transmission power of macro - bs ( m - bs ) , femtocell 1-bs ( f1-bs ) , and femtocell 2-bs ( f2-bs ) at each sub - channel , respectively .",
    "receive power of macrouser ( m - ue ) @xmath9 from m - bs at sub - channel @xmath10 is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is channel fading at sub - channel @xmath10 , @xmath13 is the amplification factor for power control , and @xmath14 is path loss between m - bs to the user where @xmath15 is unit - less path loss parameter varying with wavelength of rf carrier @xmath16 and reference distance @xmath17 of environment between bs to the user , @xmath18 is path loss exponent for outdoor transmission , and @xmath19 is the distance between m - bs to m - ue @xmath9@xcite . in case of indoor femtocell transmission ,",
    "the received power of femtouser in femtocell 1 ( f1-ue ) @xmath20 from f1-bs at sub - channel @xmath10 is similarly determined as @xmath21 .",
    "we assume perfect power control , adjusted to the propagation losses and ignoring the short - term fading effects . if sub - channel @xmath10 is allocated to m - ue @xmath9 in macrocell and f1-ue @xmath20 in femtocell1 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the receive power at m - ue @xmath9 and f1-ue @xmath20 as desired signal become @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . for indoor - outdoor and outdoor - indoor propagation ,",
    "penetration loss from building walls @xmath26 is also considered .",
    "hence , the receive power at m - ue @xmath9 from f1-bs and f1-ue @xmath20 from m - bs as interference signal become @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . since we consider perfect power control , the system performance determined in this paper is the upper - bound or maximum achievable performance of the network .",
    "in order to study the trade - off between ora and ia , the @xmath2 sub - channels are divided into two groups .",
    "the first group of @xmath29 channels is used for ora and this number @xmath29 is briefly referred to as a _ trade - off number_. the second group of @xmath30 channels is used to perform ia .",
    "basically , ora searches for sub - channels in which there is least interference among the macro / femto transmissions , while ia is used to deal with strong interference among users in macrocell and femtocells .",
    "therefore , channel assignment strategy for ora and ia is in the way that @xmath29 sub - channels are allocated to users in ora group prior to the rest @xmath30 sub - channels allocated to users in ia group , such that users in two groups can do their best with the different level of interference . in our analysis",
    ", we aim to find the optimum trade - off number which can make the network achieve the highest sum - rate with ora - ia scheme .    from this point of view",
    ", it would be straightforward to think that the first @xmath29 sub - channels are allocated to @xmath29 users from each cell , and the rest @xmath31 sub - channels are allocated to the rest @xmath32 users from each cell . here",
    ", the number of sub - channels and the number of users in each cell for both groups fit together . however , there are subtle problems with such an approach .",
    "when @xmath33 , then we can not consistently use the same ora strategy , as there are @xmath34 and only @xmath1 users , such that there should be one user that gets allocated an additional sub - channel .",
    "therefore , we need to define an ora strategy that can be consistently applied for any @xmath35 .",
    "this is done in the following way .",
    "first , we search for users , each from the macrocell and two femtocells , who can achieve the highest sum - rate at each channel .",
    "then , we pick @xmath29 sub - channels which have the highest sum - rate among all @xmath2 sub - channels to be in ora group . by this ora strategy",
    ", we aim to determine the maximum achievable rate of users , so there might be some users assigned to more than one sub - channel .",
    "in addition , in the case that @xmath36 , the number of sub - channels for ia group becomes @xmath37 sub - channel which is not enough to perform ia , thus @xmath29 sub - channels are allocated to ora group and ia is not performed in this case .",
    "the notations of sets used in allocation algorithm is defined as follows : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the set of m - ues , f1-ues , f2-ues and sub - channels respectively , and @xmath9 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath10 denote the index of m - ue , f1-ue , f2-ue and sub - channel in sets @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",

    "( e.g. f1-bs ) , two precoders are applied to carry @xmath65 streams , @xmath66^{t}$ ] , each of which is intended for each user , over @xmath64 sub - channels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ia ] .",

    "next , f1-ue @xmath20 estimates the interference channel from m - bs @xmath77 by using a preamble , and then generates a null vector @xmath78 , @xmath79 such that @xmath80 . after applying this vector to the receive signal ,",
    "outer cell interference is eliminated : @xmath81 , where @xmath82 . with this , there is still intra - cell interference left within the femtocell . in order to enable the f1-bs to cancel the interference among the femtocell users ,",

    "there is a freedom in choosing the transmit / receive vectors , such that we can optimize them in order to maximize the sum - rate achieved by ia .",
