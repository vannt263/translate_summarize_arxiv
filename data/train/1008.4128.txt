    "there has been much recent interest in theories of gravity arising from scenarios with extra spatial dimensions .",
    "many examples of these are based on the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model  @xcite  a @xmath3 dimensional theory with action consisting simply of separate einstein - hilbert terms in the bulk and on a codimension-1 brane , to which standard model particles are also confined .",
    "the model results in a 4d gravitational force law at sufficiently small scales , which transitions to a 5d gravitational force law at a crossover length scale @xmath4 , determined by the @xmath5d and @xmath6d gravitational couplings @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively . to yield interesting cosmological dynamics ,",
    "this crossover scale is usually chosen to be of order the horizon size .",
    "much of the phenomenology of the dgp model is captured by its decoupling limit @xmath8 , @xmath9 with the strong - coupling scale @xmath10 kept fixed  @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the difference between dgp gravity and general relativity is encoded in the behavior of a scalar degree of freedom , @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamics of this scalar are invariant under internal galilean transformations @xmath12 , with @xmath13 a constant and @xmath14 a constant vector .",
    "this symmetry proves to be extremely restrictive , with a leading order self - interaction term which is a higher - derivative coupling cubic in @xmath11 , and yet which yields second order equations of motion .",
    "higher order couplings with these properties were derived independently of the dgp model  @xcite and dubbed  galileons . \"",
    "see  @xcite for cosmological studies of galileon theories .",
    "it is natural to explore induced gravity models in co - dimension greater than one  @xcite , and recently multi - galileon actions arising in the relevant @xmath6-dimensional decoupling limit have been derived  @xcite .",
    "the theories studied in @xcite are invariant under individual galilean transformations of the @xmath11 fields , and also under an internal @xmath2 symmetry rotating the fields into one another , thus forbidding the existence of terms containing an odd number of @xmath11 fields , in contrast to the co - dimension one dgp case .    in this paper",
    "we explore the nature of spherically symmetric solutions in theories with an @xmath2 internal symmetry among the galileon fields , and couplings to matter that respect this symmetry .",
    "spherical solutions for a more general bi - galileon action were discussed in  @xcite , for the specific case of a linear coupling @xmath15 to matter , where @xmath16 is the trace of the matter energy momentum tensor .",
    "this form of coupling arises from decoupling limits of dgp - like theories , because @xmath11 arises through a conformal mixing with the graviton .",
    "however , while this coupling is therefore the natural form to consider in the case of a single galileon field , it breaks the new internal symmetry satisfied by multiple galileons ( and breaks the galilean symmetry if the matter is dynamical ) .",
    "we instead study general non - derivative couplings to matter fields which respect the @xmath2 internal symmetry .    at the background level",
    ", our solution can always be rotated to lie along a single field direction , say @xmath17 , while the other field variables remain trivial , thus exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the solution exhibits vainshtein screening  @xcite , characteristic of galileon theories : we find @xmath18 sufficiently close to the source , whereas @xmath19 far away , with the crossover scale determined by a combination of the galileon self - interaction scale and the coupling to the source .",
    "however , when we turn to the stability of spherically symmetric solutions under small perturbations , we find that , sufficiently close to the source , perturbations in @xmath17 suffer from gradient instabilities along the angular directions .",
    "morever , they propagate superluminally both along the radial and angular directions ( in the regime that angular perturbations are stable ) . perturbations in the remaining @xmath20 galileon fields are stable but propagate superluminally in the radial direction .",
    "the gradient instability and superluminal propagation found here for the @xmath17 field are multi - field generalizations of single galileon instabilities  @xcite .",
    "our findings thus present significant hurdles for @xmath2 galileon models with non - derivative matter coupling .",
    "one of the main lessons to be drawn is that more general matter couplings , including derivative interactions , are necessary for the phenomenological viability of @xmath2 multi - galileon theories .",
    "for instance , the coupling @xmath21 naturally arises from brane - world constructions  @xcite and maintains both the galilean and the internal rotation symmetries .",
    "in co - dimension @xmath22 , the @xmath6-dimensional effective theory contains @xmath22 fields @xmath0 , @xmath23 , representing the @xmath22 brane - bending modes of the full @xmath24-dimensional theory . the extended symmetry of the vacuum lagrangian is ^i=^i _  x^+^i+^i _  j^j  , [ multisymmetry ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constant transformation parameters .",
    "( see @xcite for the geometric setup and origin of this symmetry ) .",
    "this transformation consists of a galilean invariance acting on each of the @xmath0 fields , and an @xmath2 rotation symmetry under which @xmath28 transforms as a vector .",
    "the unique four dimensional lagrangian density respecting this is  @xcite _ = & & -  12_^i^_i + & & - , + where @xmath29 is a coupling with dimension [ mass]@xmath30 , containing the strong interaction mass scale .",
    "the @xmath31 indices are raised and lowered with @xmath32 .",
    "it remains to couple this theory to matter .",
    "the natural coupling we might consider , the lowest dimension coupling that preserves the galilean and internal rotation symmetries , is @xmath21 .",
    "this is the coupling that naturally arises from brane matter in the construction of  @xcite .",
    "however , for static non - relativistic sources @xmath33 , and since @xmath34 for static solutions there are no nontrivial spherically symmetric solutions with this coupling .",
    "linear couplings @xmath35 arise naturally from dgp - like setups , since the @xmath11 s conformally mix with the graviton .",
    "these lead to spherical solutions  @xcite , but break the @xmath2 internal symmetry .",
    "we therefore do not consider these couplings further , and instead concentrate on the most general non - derivative coupling that preserves the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "_ coupling = t2 p(^2 )  , [ couplings ] where @xmath36 is an arbitrary function of the invariant @xmath37 .",
    "our focus is on the existence and viability of spherically symmetric solutions sourced by a delta function mass distribution t = -m ^3(r )  .",
    "the equations of motion , including the coupling  ( [ couplings ] ) , are ^i & - & + & & = mp(^2(0))^i(0)^3(r )  , where @xmath38 . restricting to spherically symmetric configurations",
    "@xmath39 , this reduces to = mp(^2(0))^i(0)^3(r )  , where y^i  , and @xmath40 .",
    "note that , due to the shift symmetry of the lagrangian , the equations of motion of galileon fields always take the form of a total derivative .",
    "thus we can integrate once to obtain the equations of motion [ finalequations ] y^i+2y^i y^2=m4r^3p(^2(0))^i(0 )  .    dividing these equations by each other",
    ", we obtain the relations = ^i(0)^j(0 )  , which , when integrated from the origin , gives = ^i(0)^j(0 )  .the various components of the solution are therefore always proportional to each other .",
    "thus , by a global @xmath2 rotation , we can rotate the solution into one direction in field space , say the @xmath41 direction , so that the solution takes the form @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "this model therefore exhibits a kind of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the internal @xmath2 symmetry , since any non - trivial solution must pick a direction in field space .",
    "equation  ( [ finalequations ] ) now takes the form y+2y^3=m4r^3p(^2(0))(0 )  .",
    "[ otheryeqn ] as @xmath45 ranges from zero to infinity , the left hand side is monotonic , and is positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath46 .",
    "for there to be a continuous solution for @xmath47 as a function of @xmath45 , the left hand side must be invertible when it is positive ( negative ) . for a solution to exist ,",
    "this requires ( for non - trivial @xmath29 ) > 0  .",
    "thus @xmath47 is also positive ( negative ) , is monotonic with @xmath45 , and ranges from zero to ( negative ) infinity as @xmath45 ranges from infinity to zero .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath48 does not cross zero , and hence @xmath11 is monotonic .",
    "equation  ( [ otheryeqn ] ) yields a solution for @xmath47 , and hence @xmath48 , as a function of @xmath45 and the parameters of the theory .",
    "integrated from @xmath49 to infinity , this will give a relation between @xmath50 and the asymptotic value of the field @xmath51 .",
    "the asymptotic field value is essentially a modulus of the theory  it will be set by whatever cosmological expectation value is present .",
    "it is a physically meaningful parameter as it affects the coupling to the source by determining @xmath50 .",
    "near the source , where the non - linear term dominates , the solution is linear in @xmath45 , _",
    "rr_(r ) ~(0)+^1/3r  , whereas far from the source , where the linear term dominates , the solution goes like @xmath52 , _",
    "rr_(r ) ~()-m4p(^2(0))(0)1r  , where the transition between these regimes occurs at the radius r_~(m^2 ^2)^1/6  . [ vainshteinradius ]",
    "note that this crossover radius , and hence the distance at which non - linearities become important , depends on the modulus @xmath50 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath53 is readily solved numerically , and the solution obtained is plotted schematically in fig .",
    "[ figure ] .",
    "while the existence of static , spherically - symmetric configurations is encouraging , there are , of course , other important checks that our solution must pass to be physically viable .",
    "specifically , following  @xcite , we must study the stability of these spherically symmetric solutions and to determine the speed at which fluctuations propagate , since superluminal propagation can be an obstacle to finding an ultraviolet completion of the effective theory  @xcite .",
    "we expand the field in perturbations around the background solution @xmath54 , ^i=^i_0+^i  .away from the source , the linearized equations of motion for the perturbations are of the form -k^t_i(r ) _ t^2 ^i + 1r^2 _ r",

    "r ^i ) + k^_i(r ) _ ^2 ^i = 0  , where the coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 depend on @xmath45 through the background field @xmath39 .",
    "we find k^t_1&=&13r^2dr  ; + k^r_1&=&1 + 6y^2  ; + k^_1&=&12rdr  ; + k^t_i1&=&13r^2dr  ; + k^r_i1&=&1 + 2y^2  ; + k^_i1&=&12rdr  .",

    "[ k2 ]    stability of the spherically symmetric background solutions against small perturbations requires @xmath60 for all @xmath61 s .",
    "the @xmath62 directions in field space are stable , but the @xmath63 direction exhibits a gradient instability sufficiently close to the source along the angular directions . in other words , @xmath64 near the source .",
    "therefore , localized perturbations can be found near the source that lower the energy of the solution through their gradients .",
    "this instability plagues very short - wavelength fluctuations , right down to the uv cutoff , so decay rates are dominated by the shortest distances in the theory and can not be reliably computed within the effective theory .",
    "equations  ( [ k2 ] ) also allow us to compute the speeds of propagation of our small perturbations , in both the radial and angular directions .",
    "these are given by ( c^2)^r_1 & = & k^r_1k^t_1= ( 1 + 6y^2)^2  ; + ( c^2)^_1 & = & k^_1k^t_1=11 - 6y^2  ; + ( c^2)^r_i1 & = & k^r_i1k^t_i1= ( 1 + 2y^2)(1 + 6y^2)1 + 12 ^ 2 y^4  ; + ( c^2)^_i1 & = & k^_i1k^t_i1 = 1 + 2y^21 + 12 ^ 2 y^4  . note that @xmath65 , and hence these perturbations always propagate superluminally .",
    "the same is true of @xmath66 , in regions where these perturbations are stable .",
    "the speed @xmath67 is always superluminal , and @xmath68 is always subluminal .",
    "whether superluminal propagation of signals is problematic for a low - energy effective theory is still an arguable issue , but it seems that at the least it may preclude the possibility of embedding the theory in a local , lorentz - invariant uv completion  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note in passing that if a mechanism exists to tame the instabilities we have identified , then precision tests of gravity within the solar system already place useful constraints on multi - galileon theories .",
    "the galileon is screened at radii below the vainshtein radius @xmath69 , given by equation  ( [ vainshteinradius ] ) , restoring the behavior of general relativity .",
    "requiring the solar system to be screened to @xmath70 thus yields a constraint on @xmath29 and @xmath50 . however , lunar laser ranging data constrain the departure from the gravitational potential predicted by gr to satisfy @xmath71 ( at radius @xmath72 cm ) , and we may translate this into a constraint on a different combination of @xmath29 and @xmath50    for example , consider the choice of @xmath73 , giving a linear coupling between the radial @xmath11 field and matter . in the interesting case when the constraints are saturated , and detection of an effect is therefore imminent ,",
    "the relevant constraint simply becomes 10 ^ -9  ev  .",
    "note that this is an extremely low cutoff for the effective theory , as is also found in the dgp model .",
    "we have derived spherically - symmetric solutions in an @xmath2 multi - galileon theory with general , non - derivative couplings to matter .",
    "these solutions exhibit a vainshtein screening effect , characteristic of galileon models .",
    "however , a study of the behavior of fluctuations around these solutions shows that one of the fields has imaginary sound speed along the angular directions , signaling an instability to anisotropic modes of arbitrarily short wavelength .",
    "moreover fluctuations inevitably propagate superluminally .",
    "these results raise serious concerns about the phenomenological viability of @xmath2 multi - galileon theories .",
    "( of course , this does not preclude their effectiveness in early universe physics  @xcite , for instance during inflation , as long as they become massive or decouple before the present epoch . ) a key input in our analysis is the restriction to non - derivative coupling to matter .",
