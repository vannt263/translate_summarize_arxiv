    "the neutrino magnetic moments ( nmm ) expected in the standard model are very small and proportional to the neutrino masses  @xcite : @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the electron bohr magneton , and @xmath2 is the electron mass . thus any larger value of @xmath3 can arise only from physics beyond the standard model ( a recent review of this subject can be found in ref .",
    "current direct experimental searches  @xcite for a magnetic moment of the electron ( anti)neutrinos from reactors have lowered the upper limit on @xmath3 down to @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "these ultra low background experiments use germanium crystal detectors exposed to the neutrino flux from a reactor and search for scattering events by measuring the energy @xmath5 deposited by the neutrino scattering in the detector .",
    "the sensitivity of such a search to nmm crucially depends on lowering the threshold for the energy transfer @xmath5 , due to the enhancement of the magnetic scattering relative to the standard electroweak one at low @xmath5 .",
    "namely , the differential cross section @xmath6 is given by the incoherent sum of the magnetic and the standard cross section , and for the scattering on free electrons the nmm contribution is given by the formula  @xcite = 4 _ ^2 ( 1 t - 1 e _ ) = ^2 m^2 ( _ _ b ) ^2 ( 1 t - 1 e _ )   [ fe ] where @xmath7 is the energy of the incident neutrino , and displays a @xmath8 enhancement at low energy transfer .",
    "the standard electroweak contribution is constant in @xmath5 at @xmath9 : = g_f^2 m 2 ( 1 + 4 ^2 _ w + 8 ^4 _ w ) 5 10 ^ -48 cm^2 / kev .",
    "[ sew ] in what follows we refer to these two types of contribution to the scattering as , respectively , the magnetic and the weak .    the current experiments have reached threshold values of @xmath5 as low as few kev and are likely to further improve the sensitivity to low energy deposition in the detector . at low energies however one can expect a modification of the free - electron formulas ( [ fe ] ) and ( [ sew ] ) due to the binding of electrons in the germanium atoms , where e.g. the energy of the @xmath10 line , 9.89kev , indicates that at least some of the atomic binding energies are comparable to the already relevant to the experiment values of @xmath5 .",
    "thus a proper treatment of the atomic effects in neutrino scattering is necessary and important for the analysis of the current and even more of the future data with a still lower threshold .",
    "furthermore , there is no known means of independently calibrating experimentally the response of atomic systems , such as the germanium , to the scattering due to the interactions relevant for the neutrino experiments .",
    "therefore one has to rely on a pure theoretical analysis in interpreting the neutrino data .",
    "this problem had been addressed numerically in the past  @xcite and the interest to the problem was renewed in several recent papers , which however are ridden by a ` trial and error ' approach .",
    "the early claim  @xcite of a significant enhancement of the nmm contribution by the atomic effects has been later disproved  @xcite and it was argued  @xcite that the modification of the formulas ( [ fe ] ) and ( [ sew ] ) by the atomic binding effects is insignificant down to very low values of @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite is also generally invalidated by singularities of the relevant correlation function in the complex plane of momentum transfer , so that the claimed behavior of the cross section at low @xmath5 applies only in the semiclassical limit , although , as will be shown here , it gives a very good approximation to the actual behavior for an electron bound by a coulomb potential .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the subject of neutrino scattering on atoms at low energy transfer .",
    "we aim at describing this process at @xmath5 in the range of few kev and lower , so that the motion of the electrons is considered as strictly nonrelativistic .",
    "also in this range the energy of the dominant part of the incident neutrinos from the reactor is much larger than @xmath5 and we thus neglect any terms whose relative value is proportional to @xmath12 ( in particular , in this range one can neglect the @xmath13 term in eq.([fe ] ) in comparison with @xmath8 ) .",
    "furthermore any recoil of the germanium atom as a whole results in an energy transfer less than @xmath14 , which at the typical reactor neutrino energy is well below the considered here kev range of the energy transfer .",
    "thus we formally set the mass of the atomic nucleus to infinity and neglect any recoil by the atom as a whole .",
    "in particular , under these conditions the interaction of the neutrino with the nucleus can be entirely neglected , and only the scattering on the atomic electrons is to be considered .",
    "we find that in the scattering on realistic atoms , such as germanium , the so - called stepping approximation works with a very good accuracy .",
    "the stepping approach , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite from an interpretation of numerical data , treats the process as scattering on individual independent electrons occupying atomic orbitals and suggests that the cross section follows the free - electron behavior in eqs.([fe ] ) and ( [ sew ] ) down to @xmath5 equal to the ionization threshold for the orbital , and that below that energy the electron on the corresponding orbital is ` deactivated ' thus producing a sharp ` step ' in the dependence of the cross section on @xmath5 . in the present paper",

    "we believe that the latter conclusion explains the so - called stepping behavior observed empirically  @xcite in the results of numerical calculations .",
    "namely the calculated cross section @xmath6 for ionization of an electron from an atomic orbital follows the free - electron dependence on @xmath5 all the way down to the threshold for the corresponding orbital with a very small , at most a few percent , deviation .",

    "for this reason we refer to @xmath84 as an _ activation factor_. we conclude here that the stepping approximation is indeed justified with a high accuracy in the approximation of the scattering on independent electrons , i.e. if one neglects the two - electron correlations induced by the interference of terms in the operator @xmath23 in eq.([ne ] ) corresponding to different electrons . in the next section we estimate the effect of such an interference and find that the resulting corrections are small , at least in atoms with large @xmath26 , such as the germanium .",
    "in this section we discuss the correction arising from a correlation between two electrons .",

    "the discussed statistical model is known to approximate the average bulk properties of the atomic electrons with a relative accuracy @xmath157 and as long as the essential distances @xmath124 satisfy the condition @xmath158 , which condition in terms of the scaling variable @xmath159 reads as @xmath160 . in terms of the formula ( [ zeff ] ) for the number of active electrons , the lower bound on the applicability of the model is formally broken at @xmath161 , i.e. at the energy scale of the inner atomic shells .",

    "the deviation from this approximation due to the onset of the ionization near the threshold is less than 5% ( of the height of the step ) for the @xmath142 electrons , if one applies the analytical behavior of this onset that we find for the ground state of a hydrogen - like ion .",
    "we also find that the free - electron expressions for the cross section are not affected by the atomic binding effects in the semiclassical limit and for independent electrons .",
    "for this reason we expect that the deviation of the actual onset from a step function at the threshold for ionization of higher atomic orbitals is even smaller than for the ground state , since the motion in the higher states is closer to the semiclassical limit .",
    "the approximation of independent electrons lacks an account for the two - electron correlations arising from the coulomb interaction between the electrons in the atom .",
    "we estimate this effect in the large @xmath26 limit using the thomas - fermi model and argue that the effect of the correlations is small in germanium for the values of the energy transfer above @xmath170kev .",

    "the sum rule ( [ sr1 ] ) can also be derived from the latter expression in eq.([f1 ] ) .",
