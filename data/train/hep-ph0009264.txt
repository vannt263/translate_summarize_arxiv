    "inclusive cross sections like @xmath4 are measured at a centre - of - mass - energy @xmath5=91.2 gev for example by the delphi detector at lep@xcite .",
    "so far , only phenomenological models , which need to be tuned to the data , are available to describe the fragmentation of quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "a direct qcd calculation for these inclusive cross sections seems difficult because of the importance of non - perturbative effects . in order to be able to include these soft processes",
    ", one should start from an expression for the inclusive cross section which is suitable for non - perturbative calculations .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "the basic relations for single inclusive cross sections are recalled . in section 3",
    "we present our general formalism for the modified effective theory in the case of scalar fields . as a specific example the cross section @xmath6 is considered in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) with massive photons and the theory of quarks interacting with abelian gluons in section 4 .",
    "a path integral representation for inclusive cross sections in the abelian gluon model is derived .",
    "in this section we recall some basic relations for inclusive cross sections .",
    "our notation follows @xcite .",
    "let us consider a single - particle inclusive reaction , i.e @xmath7 to take a simple case , let @xmath8 be spinless particles with masses @xmath9 .",
    "energy squared is @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11-matrix element for the reaction ( [ 2.1 ] ) is given as @xmath12 here we have applied the reduction formula for particle @xmath13 in the final state .",
    "let @xmath14 be a suitable interpolating field for @xmath13 and @xmath15 the corresponding wave function renormalisation constant .",
    "the @xmath16-matrix element is obtained from the @xmath11-matrix element via @xmath17 @xmath18 the single - particle inclusive cross section @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 in the usual way the sum over all states @xmath21 in ( [ 2.5 ] ) can be carried out using completeness and translational invariance @xmath22 rewrite @xmath19 to get time - ordered operators @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 the amplitude @xmath26 will be written as a field - field correlation function in a forward scattering amplitude , but in a modified effective theory .",
    "let us assume that the basic dynamical variables of the original theory are the operators for unrenormalised scalar fields @xmath27 and their conjugate canonical momenta @xmath28 .",
    "we denote @xmath29 collectively as @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the hamiltonian of the system which we split into a free part @xmath32 and an interaction part @xmath3 which may depend explicitly on the time @xmath33 , but should not involve time derivatives of @xmath34 @xmath35 with @xmath36 besides the interacting fields and momenta @xmath37 free fields and momenta @xmath38 are considered with the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath32 .",
    "we assume now as usual that there exist unitary operators @xmath39 that realize the time - dependent canonical transformations relating @xmath37 to @xmath38 @xmath40 taking as boundary condition @xmath41 we get @xmath42.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define furthermore @xmath43 so that the @xmath11-matrix is given as @xmath44.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we return to the single inclusive cross section , where we have to calculate the matrix element @xmath45 following the time - dependence in @xmath46 from the right to the left , we start at time @xmath47 and pass through operators of increasing time arguments until time @xmath48 . then the time sequence changes and we go back in time to time @xmath49 . in a usual matrix element the time arguments should increase instead",
    ". we will now show that we can write the matrix element @xmath46 in the usual form , with time increasing from right to left , if we pass to operators @xmath50 of the form ( [ eqn111 ] ) but with a modified interaction hamiltonian @xmath51 . as the time - sequence in @xmath52 is correct up to @xmath53 , we request @xmath54 with @xmath55.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows @xmath56 for @xmath57 our modified interaction hamiltonian @xmath58 depends on the free fields and momenta at time @xmath59 .",
    "but we know how to express the free fields and momenta at time @xmath59 by their values at time @xmath33 using the free field equations of motion .",
    "thus , we can consider @xmath58 as a nonlocal functional of the dynamical variables @xmath60 at the same time @xmath33 also for @xmath57 @xmath61    therefore , we can consider our matrix element as of the standard type but in the modified theory governed by the total hamiltonian @xmath62 here we denote by @xmath63 matrix elements in the modified theory @xmath64    the matrix element @xmath52 is written in the standard form with an in - state to the right and an out - state to the left .",
    "the prize we have to pay is that we have to use the modified theory where the hamiltonian @xmath65 has a sudden variation at @xmath53 and is nonlocal for @xmath57 .",
    "in this section inclusive reactions are considered in qed coupled to an abelian gluon model .",
    "an example for such a reaction is @xmath66    starting point is the lagrangian describing the interaction of electrons of mass @xmath67 and charge @xmath68 with a massive photon of mass @xmath69 - to avoid any infrared divergences - and of two quark flavours of equal mass @xmath70 and electric charge @xmath71 with the photon and a massive abelian gluon of mass @xmath72 .",
    "as lagrangian we choose @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the abelian gluon field and @xmath75 its field strength tensor , @xmath76 the photon field and @xmath77 its field strength tensor , @xmath78 the electron field and @xmath79 the quark field .",
    "we have a quark field with two flavours and @xmath80 is the usual pauli matrix .    the hamiltonian corresponding to ( [ eqn1000 ] ) can be obtained as usual by a legendre transformation .",
    "only the interaction term has to be altered in order to construct the hamilton operator for the modified theory @xmath81\\nonumber\\\\ \\qquad\\qquad\\mbox{with}\\ \\tilde{y}=(-y^0,\\vec{y}).\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xmath82 the fields at time @xmath83 have to be substituted by the fields at time @xmath84 .",
    "two points should be stressed : first , due to the jump in the interaction , the effective theory has no time translation invariance , so that no longer energy conservation holds at every vertex .",
    "second , the effective interaction contains derivatives .      for unpolarised @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the initial state and summation over spin and flavour of the final state quark",
    "the matrix element reads @xmath88 in order to calculate @xmath52 we expand it in powers of the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath89 .",

    "@xmath94    the distinction between both contributions is given by the fact , that the upper diagram has got an imaginary part , whereas the lower one is completely real so that we get only a contribution from the upper diagram @xmath95 which is , of course , the standard result , which one obtains in considering to lowest order the reaction @xmath96 for two quark flavours of charge @xmath97 .      in the last subsection @xmath52 and",
    "therefore the one - quark - inclusive cross - section could be expressed in terms of quark 6-point - functions after separating the electromagnetic interaction by a perturbative calculation . as the coupling @xmath91",
    "is not assumed to be small we will now derive a representation of these quark 6-point - functions suitable for non - perturbative calculations . for this we consider the hamiltonian path integral in our effective theory obtained from the abelian gluon model .",
    "any green s function of the theory can be written as @xmath98 with @xmath99 here the classical fields @xmath100 and @xmath101 and the grassmann fields @xmath79 and @xmath102 have to be inserted into the part of @xmath103 ( [ eqn16 ] ) which describes the abelian gluon model .",
    "furthermore for @xmath104 the classical and grassmann fields have to be time - shifted .",
    "as the hamiltonian path integral is quadratic in @xmath105 , the fermionic fields can be integrated out . with the green s function @xmath106 of the quark in the modified gluon background @xmath107 the quark propagator",
    "is given as @xmath108 where the brackets @xmath63 on the right hand side denote the average over all gluon fields with the measure dictated by the path - integral @xmath109 inserting the green s function into the matrix element we get the inclusive cross section expressed explicitely in terms of a hamiltonian path integral .",
    "this expression should be a convenient starting point for applying non - perturbative methods to an evaluation of inclusive cross sections .",
    "it should be possible , for instance , to generalise the methods of @xcite to the case of this effective theory here .",
    "we have written the inclusive cross section as imaginary part of an amplitude @xmath110 for which we have given a path integral representation . we have applied our formalism to the reaction @xmath6 and checked that in lowest nontrivial order we get the correct result .",
    "our hope is that our path integral representation will lead to a genuinely non - perturbative evaluation of inclusive cross sections at high energies along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the generalisation to qcd should be straightforward .",
    "our methods should allow a description of inclusive production of hadrons @xmath111 in @xmath85 annihilation at high energies @xmath112 in terms of a genuine ope .",
    "a similar approach should be possible for fracture functions @xcite for hadron - hadron scattering @xmath113"
