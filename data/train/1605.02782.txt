    "viscosity , i.e. the resistance to a flow in which adjacent parts of a fluid move with different velocities , is a basic property of all classical and quantum liquids , and becomes relevant for electron liquids as well , when disorder and coupling to the lattice are not too strong . as a transport coefficient of a fluid associated with the transport of its momentum ,",
    "viscosity is a fourth - rank tensor that connects the stress tensor with the rate of change of the strain tensor according to the formula @xmath3 where @xmath4 are cartesian indices , @xmath5 is the symmetrized gradient of the velocity field @xmath6 , and the stress tensor @xmath7 is obtained from the derivative of the hamiltonian with respect to the metric tensor . in homogeneous rotationally - invariant systems ,",

    "when the tensor is subjected to rigorous scrutiny for a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a perpendicular magnetic field , it is seen that the broken time reversal symmetry allows , besides the conventional shear and bulk viscosities , the existence of a third _ non - dissipative _ component , known as the hall viscosity ( denoted by @xmath10 ) @xcite  also referred to as",
