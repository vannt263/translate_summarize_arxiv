    "a rich variety of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves and oscillations have been detected in the structured solar atmosphere ( e.g. , the reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . while identifying waves / oscillations was possible with radio and optical instruments prior to the 1990s  ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the majority of such observations emerged only after the advent of the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , the transition region and corona explorer ( trace ) , and later hinode , in conjunction with the availability of ground - based instruments with very high temporal and spatial resolution such as the dutch open telescope ( dot ) and the swedish solar telescope ( sst ) .",
    "for instance , imaging and spectroscopic instruments on soho , along with the h@xmath2 measurements with sst and dot have shown that mhd oscillations abound in prominences - cool and dense clouds suspended in the corona ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "instruments with high spatial resolution like the solar optical telescope ( sot ) on board hinode have detected transverse oscillatory loop - like structures accompanied by downflows termed `` coronal rains '' @xcite .",
    "hinode / sot has also detected transverse oscillations in spicules - chromospheric materials isolated from a coronal environment . using the ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ) data",
    ", @xcite detected significant periodic oscillations in h i ly@xmath3 intensities in a coronal hole , the quiet sun and a streamer .",
    "coronal loops offer by far the most samples of mhd oscillations , among which the majority seems to be standing transverse oscillations triggered by flares  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "identifying the observed oscillations with a particular mhd mode collectively supported by a magnetized structure is physically crucial but proves difficult .",
    "this is best illustrated by the substantial controversy associated with interpreting the observed transverse oscillations in terms of alfvn waves  ( for the most recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "this happens with both coronal  @xcite and spicule measurements  @xcite , the interpretation of which as alfvn waves was suggested to be inconsistent with theory by  @xcite and later by  @xcite .",
    "the first unambiguous detection of alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere is due to  @xcite where h@xmath3 observations with sst of a group of magnetic bright points are analyzed .",
    "less controversial is the identification of fast and slow waves .",
    "consider first the coronal case .",
    "flare - triggered transverse oscillations supported by loops are usually fast kink modes  . on the other hand ,",
    "fast sausage modes were also inferred albeit much less abundant  . as for the slow waves ,",
    "they are frequently observed and appear both in the form of standing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and as propagating ones ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for comprehensive reviews ) . when it comes to atmospheric parts other than the corona , sausage waves are directly observed in the photosphere  @xcite and chromosphere  @xcite .",
    "note that in the fine structures examined in the latter study , these fast sausage waves , manifested as intensity oscillations , appear simultaneously with fast kink waves , manifested in the form of transverse displacements . that periodic longitudinal and transverse oscillatory motions may accompany each other was first shown by   for hinode loops . at this point",
    ", it should be noted that adopting a helioseismic approach by working with the power spectra of , say , the doppler shift time series , can greatly improve the capability for wave identification , as was advocated by  .",
    "once identified , the measured properties of waves and oscillations can then be combined with mhd theory to yield parameters of the solar atmosphere that are otherwise difficult to measure .",
    "the idea behind this was put forward as early as in the 1970 s following the pioneering work by  @xcite and @xcite . along with others , roberts and co - workers  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) expressed the idea in the mathematical form now in routine use .",
    "this powerful diagnostic capability , initially termed `` coronal seismology '' , may be properly called `` solar magneto - seismology '' ( sms ) , given that both observations and seismological applications extend well beyond the solar corona ( for recent reviews , see  @xcite  @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite  @xcite ; @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter that is perhaps most frequently inferred is the magnetic field strength .",
    "for instance , measuring the periodic flare - generated transverse displacements in several trace loops leads to concrete estimates of the coronal magnetic field strength  .",
    "this practice was also applied to loops observed by hinode / sot  , and recently by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on board the solar dynamic observatory ( sdo )  .",
    "certainly sms can offer more . as a matter of fact",
    ", slow waves running in active region loops measured by the solar terrestrial relations observatory ( stereo ) enabled  @xcite to infer loop temperatures via the measured propagation speeds .",
    "slow waves measured by hinode also helped derive the effective adiabatic index  @xcite .",
    "multiple periodicities detected in some oscillating structures are playing an increasingly important role in solar magneto - seismology  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "they may have disparate timescales , differing by nearly a factor of @xmath4 as shown in the light curve data obtained by the lyra irradiance experiment , indicative of the coexistence of slow and fast modes  @xcite .",
    "this coexistence can help derive the plasma beta and density contrast of the flare loops where the oscillations are found .",
    "they may have comparable timescales , favoring an interpretation of the coexistence of a fundamental mode with its overtones .",
    "two   and three periodicities   have been found .",
    "one thing peculiar with the multiple periodicities is that the ratio between the period of the fundamental and twice the period of its first overtone , @xmath0 , deviates in general from unity .",
    "for instance , the loops labeled c and d in the trace 171  images on 15 april 2001 exhibit a @xmath0 of 0.91 and 0.82 , respectively  @xcite . a further study using similar trace 171  loops on 23 nov 1998 yields a @xmath0 of 0.9  .",
    "this is not expected for kink modes supported by a longitudinally uniform loop with tiny aspect ratios .",
    "hence the deviation of @xmath0 from @xmath5 may signify some longitudinal structuring .",
    "actually  @xcite come up with a one - to - one look - up diagram where the density scale height along the loop in units of the loop length can be readily deduced once @xmath6 is known .",
    "fundamental or global sausage modes with their first overtones were also found .",
    "for example , flare - associated quasi - periodic pulsations measured with the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ) on 12 jan 2000 contain a global sausage mode with period @xmath7  s , and a higher harmonic with @xmath8  s  .",
    "moreover , high spatial resolution h@xmath2 images of oscillating cool post - flare loops measured with the solar tower telescope at aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences ( aries ) yield a @xmath9  s and a @xmath10  s  @xcite .",
    "flows are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have been found in oscillating structures  .",
    "take the corona for instance .",
    "the frequently found flow speeds , usually @xmath11",
    "@xmath12  and hence well below the alfvn speed , have only weak effects on the periods of the fundamental kink mode and its overtone supported by thin loops  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore it is suggested that the effect of flow may be neglected in the seismological applications of @xmath6 to the corona .",
    "however , the flow speeds may not be always small .",
    "although less frequent , flow speeds reaching the alfvnic range ( @xmath13  @xmath12 ) have been seen associated with explosive events  .",
    "taking into account a siphon flow of the order of the alfvn speed may lead to significant revisions to the loop parameters deduced from seismology . for the standing kink mode measured with trace and soho on 15 sept 2001  @xcite , @xcite show that neglecting the flows leads to an underestimation of the loop magnetic field by up to a factor of three !",
    "such a revision is important in its own right , and also important in the context of coronal heating because the energy flux density carried by the transverse waves is proportional to the magnetic field strength .",
    "given the importance of multiple periodicities in the context of solar magneto - seismology , and the extent to which a flow may affect the seismological applications , it seems natural to examine further how the flows affect multiple periodicities from the theoretical perspective . in the case of cylindrical geometry , this has been done by  @xcite in the thin - tube approximation .",
    "here we consider a slab geometry first , and leave the study of coronal cylinders with finite aspect ratio to a future publication . by doing so , we will complement and expand the only study concerning the period ratios of a coronal slab  , which shows that the transverse structuring may contribute to the deviation of the period ratio from @xmath5 .",
    "this is true even for relatively thin slabs , and is more pronounced for high density contrasts . extending the static slab study by   to incorporate flows , we will examine how the flows affect the dispersion properties and hence the period ratios of both standing kink and sausage modes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_dr_oview ]",
    ", we briefly describe the slab dispersion relation .",
    "section  [ sec_cor_pratio ] deals with coronal slabs by first giving an overview of their dispersion diagrams , then describing a graphical means to derive the period ratios , and also examining in detail how the flow affects the period ratios for the standing kink and sausage modes .",
    "the same approach is also applied to isolated photospheric slabs , the results thus derived are given in section  [ sec_pho_pratio ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec_summary ] summarizes the results , ending with some concluding remarks .",
    "consider a slab of half - width @xmath14 with time - independent siphon flows . as",
    "illustrated in fig.[fig_slab_illus ] , the slab is infinite in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions , but is bordered by two interfaces @xmath17 .",
    "let the subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the otherwise uniform parameters inside and external to the slab , respectively .",
    "the background magnetic fields ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , together with the flow velocities ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , are in the @xmath16direction .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the mass density and thermal pressure . from the force balance condition across the interfaces it follows that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the adiabatic index ,",
    "@xmath28 is the adiabatic sound and @xmath29 the alfvn speed . to proceed",
    ", it proves convenient to introduce the tube speed @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the dispersion relation ( dr ) for the waves supported by a slab with flow has been examined by a number of authors   ( also see  @xcite  @xcite for the waves supported by cylinders with flows ) . restricting oneself to propagation in the @xmath32 plane , and to linear perturbations , one may adopt the ansatz that any perturbation @xmath33 to the equilibrium @xmath34 is in the form @xmath35\\right\\ } , \\label{eq_wav_ansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 means taking the real part of the function .",

    "consequently simultaneously changes the signs of both sides of the drs .",
    "the end result is that , the dispersion diagram expressing @xmath37 as a function of @xmath66 is symmetric about the @xmath69 axis and one needs only to consider the 1st and 4th quadrants , as will be done in figs.[fig_cor_dr ] and [ fig_pho_dr ] . for more details , please see appendix .",

    "when @xmath102 lies in the intervals @xmath103 , @xmath104 , or @xmath105 , the waves are surfaces waves .",
    "otherwise , they are body ones .",
    "as was pointed out by  @xcite ( hereafter nr95 ) , and also evident from fig.[fig_cor_dr ] , no surface waves are introduced by the flow in the coronal case .",
    "the rest of the section complements and expands the study by  nr95 .",
    "figure  [ fig_cor_dr ] shows that the dispersion diagrams demonstrate a clear dependence on the flow speed . with increasing @xmath73",
    ", there is increasingly less symmetry between the lower and upper half of the diagrams , with a perfect symmetry taking place only for a static slab ( fig.[fig_cor_dr]a ) . for",
    "the ease of description , let us consider first the slow modes , namely the waves with @xmath37 of the order of the sound speeds .",
    "the most obvious variation with varying @xmath73 is that the slow modes are shifted upwards , encompassing always the windows @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this is understandable given that for @xmath108 , @xmath109 where @xmath110 with @xmath111 . in the opposite extreme @xmath112 , one may find @xmath113 where @xmath114 with @xmath111 . in eqs.([eq_cor_slow_smallk ] ) and ( [ eq_cor_slow_bigk ] ) , the plus and minus signs correspond to the upper and lower band , respectively .",
    "they also help explain the occurrence of the backward slow waves , labeled bsk and bss , in the upper half of figs.[fig_cor_dr]c and [ fig_cor_dr]d : even though bsk and bss have negative phase speeds in a frame comoving with the internal flow , in the current frame they have positive speeds as long as @xmath115 or @xmath116 . in view of eqs.([eq_hj ] ) and ( [ eq_gj ] ) , there actually exists an infinite number of branches of slow modes .",
    "however , in fig.[fig_cor_dr ] it is neither easy to differentiate these branches , or to distinguish between the kink and sausage modes , since @xmath117 differs only slightly from @xmath118 .",
    "given that the slow modes are nearly nondispersive , and that the deviation from unity of the period ratio @xmath0 is due entirely to wave dispersion in the current study , we will not examine @xmath0 associated with slow modes .",
    "the fast modes are more interesting since they show significant dispersion . with increasing @xmath73 ,",
    "while the modes in the upper half of the @xmath119 plane become less dispersive , the opposite is true for the ones in the lower - half : the phase speeds of fast modes are bounded in the former by @xmath120 and @xmath86 , and bounded by @xmath121 and @xmath122 in the latter .",
    "it can be readily shown that this behavior results from the fact that for @xmath112 , @xmath123 on the other hand , except for the first kink branch , both kink and sausage modes have cutoffs , which are given by @xmath124 where @xmath125}{[(v_{ae}\\mp u_0)^2-c_{0}^2][(v_{ae}\\mp u_0)^2-v_{a0}^2 ] } }   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the first kink branch , an analytic approximation to @xmath37 in the slender slab limit @xmath126 can be found , which reads @xmath127 where @xmath128 ^ 2 ( v_{ae}^2-c_{e}^2)}{(v_{ae}^2+c_{e}^2)v_{ae}^2 ( v_{ae}^2-c_{te}^2 ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath129 and @xmath130 representing the upper and lower branches , respectively .",
    "compared with nr95 , the most relevant study to ours , we have extended the expressions pertaining to slow waves in the slender slab limit ( eq.(16 ) in nr95 ) to accommodate negative values of phase speeds ( see eq.([eq_cor_slow_smallk ] ) ) . in addition",

    "this , together with a negative @xmath37 , yields a positive @xmath152 .",

    "furthermore , the overall tendency for both @xmath193 and @xmath194 to decrease with increasing density contrast agrees closely with fig.10 in  .",

    "the present study has been motivated by two strands of research in the field of solar magneto - seismology . on the one hand , exploiting the measured multiple periods is playing an increasingly important role in deducing the longitudinal structuring of solar atmospheric structures  @xcite on the other hand , it was recently realized that significant flows in coronal structures reaching the alfvnic regime can bring significant revisions to the seismologically deduced physical parameters such as the coronal loop magnetic field strength  @xcite . to complement and expand the only theoretical study on multiple periodicities in coronal slabs  , we examine the consequences the flows may have . to this end",

    "we find that the internal flow has significant effects on the standing modes , for the fast kink and sausage ones alike . for the kink ones , they may reduce the period ratio by up to 23% compared with the static case , and the minimum allowed period ratio may fall below the analytically derived lower limit in the static case . in particular , the reduction due to a finite flow may be significant even for thin slabs . for the sausage modes",
    ", while introducing the flow leads to a reduction in the period ratio that is typically @xmath1% relative to the static case , it has significant effects on the threshold aspect ratio only above which standing sausage modes can be supported . at a given density contrast , this threshold may exceed its static counterpart by several times for the parameters considered , thereby limiting the detectability of standing sausage modes to even wider slabs .",
    "for the isolated photospheric slabs , we find that the internal flow has only a marginal effect on the period ratios @xmath0 for the surface modes , and even less for body modes",
    ". that said , standing modes supported in this case are distinct from the coronal case in a number of aspects .",
    "first , standing sausage modes may be supported by slabs with arbitrary aspect ratios and do not suffer from a cutoff @xmath149 any longer .",
    "second , for standing kink surface modes , @xmath0 deviates from unity even for a zero - width slab , which originates from the @xmath282 dependence of phase speeds of slow kink surface waves in the slender slab limit .",
    "the present study can be extended in several ways .",
    "first , to be able to directly compare with coronal loop oscillations , so far the most observed and the best understood , we need to turn to the cylindrical geometry and examine how introducing the flow affects the dispersion behavior and consequently period ratios and cutoff aspect ratios .",
    "second , allowing the tube parameters to be time - dependent has been found important as far as the seismological applications of the period ratio are concerned  .",
    "this is expected to be also true when the flow speeds are dynamic rather than time - stationary .",
    "third , concerning the period ratios , one important contributor to its deviation from unity that has received much attention is the longitudinal structuring  @xcite , which has yet to be considered in examining the slab period ratios .",
    "nonetheless , the main results presented here , which demonstrated the influences of the introduced flow on the standing kink and sausage modes , point to the need for further investigations into such influences .     before closing , let us recall that solar magneto - seismology ( sms ) has extended well beyond the territory originally taken up by `` coronal seismology '' . one thing to note in particular , as advocated by  @xcite , is to seriously consider applying sms to photospheric structures because there exist ample observations of oscillatory motions on the one hand , relevant theories are available on the other . strictly speaking ,",
    "our results on the sausage modes are more applicable to the lower parts of the solar atmosphere . in this sense ,",

    "for instance , the curve labeled bfk1 in fig.[fig_cor_dr_zeroue_pmu0]a corresponds to ffk1 in fig.[fig_cor_dr_zeroue_pmu0]b , and likewise ffk2 in fig.[fig_cor_dr_zeroue_pmu0]a corresponds to bfk2 in fig.[fig_cor_dr_zeroue_pmu0]b . as a matter of fact ,",
    "this symmetry was present already in figs.4 and 5 in @xcite where wave modes supported by a flowing cylinder is examined .",
    "this is not surprising given that the authors also examined the case where the external background is static , and that the @xmath73 they adopted in constructing fig.4 ( @xmath309 ) is close to the one used for constructing fig.5 ( @xmath310 )",
    ". a perfect symmetry would result if the authors chose a pair of @xmath73 of the same magnitude but with opposite signs .",
    "the second symmetry , which exists only in the absence of external flows , does not invalidate the concept of resonant flow instability ( rfi )   ( see @xcite  @xcite and @xcite  @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "this point can be illustrated if one examines in detail , say , @xcite where the authors address the possible instability a velocity shear between a coronal plume and its environment may introduce .",
    "the authors choose to work in the zero - beta limit , and in a frame in which @xmath254 and @xmath73 is negative . when a continuous alfvn speed profile connects the internal and external values , rfi sets in when the `` originally forward - propagating '' ( in the sense that @xmath37 is positive when @xmath311 ) kink waves reach the continuum of the originally backward - propagating alfvn waves .",
    "this happens at a @xmath73 smaller in magnitude than required by the non - resonant kelvin - helmholtz instability , the difference between the two thresholds being quite significant for high density contrasts between the internal and external media . in light of the symmetry property we discussed",
    ", what fig.3 in  @xcite shows for a negative @xmath73 can help one to foresee what happens when @xmath73 is positive . in that case",
    ", rfi will also happen when @xmath73 reaches exactly the same magnitude , for at this point the originally backward - propagating kink waves reach the continuum of the originally forward - propagating alfvn waves .",
    "extending the present study to address rfi is physically very appealing , but may require quite some effort given the complexity related to solving eigenvalue problems that involve dealing with the dissipative layers at the alfvn resonances and the possible cusp resonances .    figure  [ fig_omegak_zeroue ] shows the wave angular frequency @xmath152 as a function of @xmath66 , constructed from the @xmath312 diagram presented in fig.[fig_cor_dr_zeroue_pmu0 ] . here figs.[fig_omegak_zeroue]a and [ fig_omegak_zeroue]b correspond to @xmath313 and @xmath314 , respectively . only kink",
    "waves are presented , for otherwise the graph will be too crowded .",
    "the first thing to note is that if one insists on @xmath152 being positive , one would need the curves in the 3rd quadrant of a @xmath119 diagram where both @xmath66 and @xmath37 are negative .",
    "however , from symmetry property 1 illustrated in fig.[fig_cor_dr_nonzeroue ] , one can construct the 3rd quadrant curves using the curves in the 4th quadrant by keeping @xmath37 unchanged while reversing the sign of @xmath66 .",
    "second , fig.[fig_omegak_zeroue ] inherits the same symmetry from fig.[fig_cor_dr_zeroue_pmu0 ] .",
    "for instance , the branch labeled bfk1 in fig.[fig_omegak_zeroue]a maps to the one labeled ffk1 in fig.[fig_omegak_zeroue]b .",
    "likewise , ffk1 in fig.[fig_omegak_zeroue]a corresponds to bfk1 in fig.[fig_omegak_zeroue]b .",
    "recall that to compute the period ratios for a given aspect ratio @xmath149 , we simply choose the two curves corresponding to the propagating waves that are to combine to form a standing mode , and then measure @xmath155 and @xmath157 that correspond to the two horizontal cuts resulting in a separation being @xmath273 and twice that , respectively .",
    "it follows from this procedure that the period ratio thus calculated would be the same in figs.[fig_omegak_zeroue]a and  [ fig_omegak_zeroue]b .",
    "evidently , if we choose to work in a frame where the external medium is not static , then the symmetry between figs.[fig_omegak_zeroue]a and  [ fig_omegak_zeroue]b will be broken , meaning that the period ratio for the same @xmath149 derived for a positive @xmath73 will differ from that derived for a negative one , even if the magnitudes of @xmath73 are equal .",
    "this means , at any given non - zero @xmath76 , for one to examine the effects of @xmath73 on the period ratios one would have to first calculate a full range of different @xmath73 , both positive and negative , then construct the @xmath163 diagram , and finally measure @xmath155 and @xmath157 .",
    "this certainly merits a detailed discussion , but is beyond the scope of the present study ."
