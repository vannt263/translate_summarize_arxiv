    "a _ point process _ in a set @xmath3 is a random collection of points in @xmath3 , whose distribution is described by a probability measure @xmath12 on the set of all possible point collections . here",
    "we will take @xmath3 to be @xmath13 , a lattice such as @xmath14 , the torus @xmath15 , a lattice on the torus , or an open subset of any of these .",
    "we always assume that any bounded subset of @xmath3 contains only finitely many points of the collection ( this is of course automatically true if @xmath3 is a lattice ) ; the collection of points is then necessarily countable and we will write it as @xmath16 , with the understanding that the @xmath17 are all distinct .",
    "well known examples of point processes are gibbs measures for equilibrium systems of statistical mechanics .",
    "the points of the process are then interpreted as the positions of particles ; because the particle configuration is identified with a subset of physical space , the models satisfy an exclusion principle : no two particles can occupy the same position .",
    "point processes are also used to model phenomena other than those of statistical mechanics , such as trains of neural spikes @xcite , departure times from queues @xcite , and positions of stars in galaxies @xcite .    in many of these cases the quantities of primary interest , partly because they are the ones most accessible to experiment , are the low order correlations , such as the one particle density @xmath18 and the pair density @xmath19 .",
    "these may be defined in terms of expectations ( averages ) , with respect to the measure @xmath12 , of products of the ( random ) _ empirical field _ @xmath20 describing the process . for continuum systems ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath3 is @xmath13 or an open subset of @xmath13 , @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dirac delta function and the @xmath17 s are as above the ( random ) positions of the points of the process . then , with @xmath23 denoting expectation with respect to @xmath12 , @xmath24 and so on ; in general , @xmath25 equation ( [ defrhon ] ) defines @xmath26 as a measure , and we will always assume that this measure assigns finite mass to any bounded set in @xmath27 ( which means that the number of particles in a bounded set in @xmath13 is a random variable with finite moments up to order @xmath28 ) .",
    "in many cases this measure is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure and we identify @xmath29 with its density , i.e. , @xmath30 is the probability of finding a particle in the infinitesimal box @xmath31 at @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "we will assume that , whenever possible , @xmath26 is extended by continuity to be defined at points where two of its arguments coincide .",
    "the @xmath26 , here and in the lattice case discussed in the next paragraph , are often referred to as the @xmath28-particle distribution functions or correlation functions .",
    "when @xmath3 is discrete , a finite set or a lattice , we will also use the notation ( [ eta ] ) and the definitions ( [ defrho1])([defrhon ] ) , interpreting @xmath34 as the kronecker delta @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 has value 0 or 1 , depending on whether the site @xmath37 is empty or occupied . note that if @xmath38 then @xmath29 , @xmath39 , vanishes whenever @xmath40 for some @xmath41 , and that for distinct sites @xmath42 , @xmath29 is the probability of having particles at these sites .    in this paper",
    "we shall study the following _ realizability problem : _ given functions @xmath18 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , nonnegative and symmetric ,",
    "does there exist a point process for which these are the correlations ?",
    "since only a finite number of correlations are prescribed , the problem may be regarded as an infinite dimensional version of the standard truncated moment problem @xcite .",
    "the full realizability problem , in which all the correlations @xmath4 , @xmath46 are given , was studied by a.  lenard @xcite .",
    "realizability , and the related question of fully describing the realizing process , are long standing problems in the classical theory of fluids @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , recently revived by torquato , stillinger , et al .",
    "this problem has been also investigated in the context of the quantum system see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . an important ingredient in that theory is the introduction of various approximation schemes for computing @xmath47 , such as the percus - yevick and hyper - netted chain approximations @xcite .",
    "it is then of primary interest to determine whether or not the resulting functions @xmath48 in fact correspond to any point process , that is , are in some sense internally consistent .",
    "if so they can provide rigorous bounds for the entropy of the system under consideration .",
    "a novel application of the realizability problem to the determination of the maximal density of sphere packing in high dimensions is discussed in @xcite .",
    "applications of the problem of describing a point process from its low order correlations occur in other contexts , for example , in the study of neural spikes @xcite . in this and other physical situations",
    "it is natural to consider a closely related problem in which the @xmath4 , @xmath49 , are specified only on part of the domain @xmath3 ; for example , on the lattice we might only specify the nearest neighbor correlations .",
    "see @xcite for a similar problem in error correcting codes .",
    "we will not consider this case further here , except for some comments at the end of section 6 .",
    "an important special case is that in which @xmath3 is @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or a periodic version of one of these ( a torus ) , and the point process is translation invariant .",
    "the specified correlation functions will then also be translation invariant and may be written in the form @xmath50 as we often work with @xmath51 , we write @xmath52 .",
    "we will often state our arguments and results in the translation invariant case , but these may frequently be extended to the more general situation ; when we do not impose translation invariance we will use a notation similar to ( [ g ] ) : @xmath53    we now make some general remarks in order to put the realizability problem in context .",
    "first , we observe that if the correlations ( [ rho])([g ] ) can be realized for some density @xmath8 , then they can also be realized , for the same functions @xmath54 , for any @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "to see this , note that if @xmath57 is the empirical field with density @xmath8 , then @xmath58 , where the @xmath59 are independent , identically distributed bernoulli random variables with expectation @xmath60 , is a field with density @xmath55 having the same value for all @xmath61 s .",
    "in other words , the new measure is constructed by independently choosing to delete or retain each point in a configuration , keeping a point with probability @xmath60 .",
    "( we will refer to this construction as _",
    "thinning_. ) in this light it is thus natural to pose the realizability problem in the following form : given the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , what is the least upper bound @xmath63 of the densities for which they can be realized ?",
    "it is of course possible in the continuum case to have @xmath64 ; for example , if @xmath65 for @xmath66 then for any density @xmath67 a poisson process realizes the correlations . for the lattice systems considered here , on the other hand",
    ", we always have @xmath68 .    lacking a full answer to this question ,",
    "one may of course ask rather for upper and lower bounds on @xmath63 .",
    "a lower bound @xmath69 may be obtained by the construction of a process at density @xmath70 ; we discuss such constructions in sections  [ lowrho][subseclee ] and show that @xmath71 under reasonable restrictions on the @xmath61 in ( [ g ] ) .",
    "upper bounds on @xmath63 may be obtained from necessary conditions for realizability , some of which are described in section  [ secneccond ] .    beyond the question of realizability one",
    "may ask about the number or more generally about the types of measures which give rise to a specified set of correlations @xmath4 , @xmath2 . a natural question in the theory of fluids , for example ,",
    "is whether any of these measures are gibbsian for interactions in a particular class ; for example , given @xmath72 and @xmath9 , is there a gibbs measure realizing these correlations which involves only pair interactions ?",
    "this question is considered in section  [ gibbs ] , where we discuss the nature of the realizing measure @xmath12 which maximizes the gibbs - shannon entropy .",
    "the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows . in section  [ secneccond ] , we discuss some necessary conditions for realizability .",
    "( in a separate paper @xcite we will present general necessary and sufficient conditions . )",
    "sections  [ lowrho ] , [ triplet ] , and [ subseclee ] cover proofs of realizability : in section  [ lowrho ] we prove a theorem , a generalization of one proven by r.  v.  ambartzumian and h.  s.  sukiasian @xcite , showing that if @xmath73 is absolutely integrable and @xmath74 satisfies a certain stability condition then the pair @xmath75 is realizable for sufficiently small @xmath8 , with explicitly given higher correlations . in section  [ triplet ]",
    "we show that the construction can be extended to the case in which the third correlation function @xmath76 is also specified , showing in particular that the realization determined by @xmath75 alone is not unique ; in fact since @xmath76 can take an uncountable number of values there are at low values of @xmath8 an uncountable number of measures realizing @xmath75 .",
    "we note also possible extensions to higher order @xmath61 . in section  [ subseclee ]",
    "we give a variant construction for lattice systems , based on the lee - yang theorem @xcite . in section  [ gibbs ]",
    "we show that a problem with specified @xmath75 , on a finite set , e.g. , a periodic lattice , may be realized by a gibbs measure with just one- and two - particle potentials whenever @xmath77 .",
    "we make some concluding remarks in section  [ conclude ] , and in the appendices discuss in some detail an illustrative one - dimensional example and give some technical proofs .",
    "clearly , from ( [ defrhon ] ) , realizability requires that @xmath78 we also know that the covariance matrix of the field @xmath36 , @xmath79 must be positive semi - definite , i.e. , for all functions @xmath80 with bounded support , @xmath81 if we take @xmath82 for @xmath83 a bounded subset of @xmath3 then ( [ covform ] ) becomes @xmath84 d{\\r_1}d\\r_2 \\geq     0 ;    \\label{ftl}\\\\\\ ] ] conversely , if ( [ ftl ] ) holds for all @xmath85 and all @xmath83 , then ( [ covform ] ) holds for all @xmath80 .    in the translation invariant case ( [ ftl ] )",

    "there are corresponding conditions on the torus @xmath15 , the lattice @xmath14 , and the periodic lattice .",
    "if equality holds in ( [ ft ] ) for some @xmath89 then clearly @xmath8 is maximal : @xmath90 .",
    "we note also a necessary condition due to yamada @xcite : if @xmath91 denotes the number of of particles in a region @xmath92 , and if @xmath93 is the fractional part of the mean of @xmath91 , so that @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , then the variance @xmath97 of @xmath91 , @xmath98      d{\\bf r}_1 d{\\bf r}_2 ,    \\label{var }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] must satisfy @xmath99 because @xmath91 is an integer : @xmath100 the above necessary conditions all follow from the more general conditions that we prove in @xcite . in summary",
    "these say that , given any functions @xmath101 , @xmath102 and constant @xmath103 such that , for any @xmath28 points @xmath104 in @xmath3 , @xmath105 , we must have @xmath106 for all @xmath107 .",
    "we prove in fact that in the case @xmath51 , i.e. for the case that only @xmath72 and @xmath9 are given , ( [ all ] ) is also a sufficient condition for realizability under some mild assumptions on the point process .",
    "we remark that in the case @xmath51 all restrictions on @xmath8 and @xmath74 beyond those arising from nonnegativity of @xmath8 and of the covariance matrix @xmath108 of ( [ cov ] ) are due to the fact that we want @xmath36 to be a point process , since we can always find a gaussian process realizing any @xmath72 , @xmath9 with @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "we also note that for @xmath110 one has @xmath111 hence equality in ( [ ft ] ) implies that the variance @xmath97 is growing slower than the volume",

    ", superhomogeneity can hold , for a given @xmath112 , only at the maximal density @xmath90 .",
    "in this section we show the realizability of a given translation invariant @xmath8 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 , for sufficiently small @xmath8 . our arguments extend immediately to the lattice @xmath14 and to the torus , as well as to non - translation invariant @xmath7 , @xmath47 .",
    "our results are an extension of those given by r.  v.  ambartzumian and h.  s.  sukiasian @xcite , and are based closely on the key idea of that paper : given @xmath8 and @xmath112 satisfying suitable conditions , one proves the existence of a translation invariant process for which the correlation functions @xmath26 , @xmath114 , are given by @xmath115 and which therefore solves the realization problem for @xmath8 and @xmath74 .",
    "the ansatz ( [ armansatz ] ) for the dependence on @xmath8 and @xmath74 of the higher order correlations ( which determines the point process uniquely ) is arguably the simplest one possible .",

    "the @xmath572 again satisfy the kirkwood - salsburg equation ( [ ks ] ) in the banach space @xmath557 , but with a modified operator @xmath188 . to define @xmath188 we write @xmath573 for @xmath574 , @xmath575 for @xmath576 , and @xmath577 for @xmath578 .",

    "next , since the factor @xmath587 in ( [ k3def ] ) vanishes unless @xmath588 and @xmath589 lie inside the ball of radius @xmath259 around @xmath351 , the sum over @xmath20 is nonzero only for those @xmath20 s such that all points @xmath590 are inside this ball . on the other hand , the factor @xmath591 implies that @xmath592 vanishes unless all the @xmath588 are separated by a distance at least @xmath261 , so that we may suppose that there are at most @xmath593 ( see ( [ ndef ] ) ) of these points inside the ball .",
