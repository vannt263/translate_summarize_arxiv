    "this is the third paper in a series analyzing the two - dimensional ( 2d ) distribution of gc systems in elliptical galaxies .",

    "these results are qualitatively in agreement with the discovery of complex gc systems in m87  @xcite and ngc4365  @xcite and reinforce the notion that merging and accretion of satellites are important in the evolution of galaxies , as predicted by the @xmath2cdm theory  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as is the case for gcs , low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can also be detected individually in elliptical galaxies , with chandra  ( see review , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing another potential marker of galaxy evolution .",
    "these lmxbs may originate both from the evolution of native stellar binary systems , or be formed by dynamical interactions in gcs  @xcite . in ngc4649 ,",
    "in addition to the inhomogeneities of the gc system , we have also seen a non - uniform distribution in the lmxbs  @xcite .",
    "some lmxbs are associated with gcs , and therefore , not surprisingly , follow the same spatial distribution , but uncorrelated inhomogeneities are also observed in lmxbs in the stellar field of ngc4649 .",
    "these results have potential implications for our understanding of both lmxb formation and the general evolution of the parent galaxy .",
    "it is therefore important to establish how frequent their occurrence may be .",
    "here we report the case of a third galaxy , ngc4278 , where we have been able to detect significant inhomogeneity in both the lmxb and the gc 2d distributions .",
    "ngc4278 is an elliptical galaxy at a distance of @xmath3 mpc  @xcite , which was the subject of deep _ chandra _ observations , resulting in a well - characterized catalog of lmxbs  ( * ? ? ?",

    "they also seem to be approximately aligned along the major axis of the galaxy , with the exclusion of an over - density in the s - w corner of the footprint .",
    "the blue gcs , on the other hand , are more evenly distributed and do not show any clear over- or under - density .",
    "u13 used five archival hst acs pointings to study the properties of the gc system in ngc4278 out to large radial distances .",
    "the sample of gc candidate was selected based on the @xmath17 color , the @xmath18 magnitude and the half - light radii of the sources extracted from the hst images .",
    "contaminants were excluded using a sample of spectroscopically confirmed gcs to determine the optimal selection and by visual inspection of all gc candidates whose half - light radii exceeded 10 pc ( u13 ) .",
    "the final catalog of u13 gc candidates , which is virtually free from contamination , contains 716 sources .",
    "u13 found that the gc candidates follow a bimodal color distribution , and the red and blue classes can be separated using a color threshold @xmath19 , leading to 370 red gcs and 346 blue gcs ( see table  [ tab : summary ] ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of u13 gcs ( figure  [ fig : positions_gc2 ] , left ) shows that the red subpopulation is more centrally concentrated than the blue subpopulation , as commonly observed in elliptical galaxies  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "u13 also checked the azimuthal distribution of gcs in the regions of ngc4278 with complete coverage ( @xmath20 ) , finding that the whole population of gcs and the two color classes separately are all consistent with a uniformly random azimuthal distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : positions_gc2 ] ( right ) compares the positions of the gcs from  b09 with those of the u13 common area .",
    "the two distributions are similar on the region of overlap , except for the core of the galaxy where the u13 catalog seems to be affected by a larger incompleteness than the catalog used by  b09 .",
    "the overall agreement between the two gc catalogs shows that hidden systematics are not likely to affect our results . as for the lmxb data ,",
    "any incompleteness effect would have only a radial dependence , because of the radial worsening of the _ chandra _ psf and of the source crowding in the center .",
    "these effects will not affect any 2d inhomogeneity .",
    "we have analyzed the 2d distributions of lmxbs and gcs , following  @xcite , where a detailed explanation of the method used in this paper is given . in brief , for each sample of lmxbs and gcs , we have first generated density maps using the k - nearest neighbor ( knn ) method of  @xcite . this density is based on the _ local _ distribution of gcs , i.e. on the distance of the @xmath21-th closest gcs from the points where the density is estimated .",
    "we have evaluated the density in each knot of a regular grid covering the region of the sky where gcs and lmxbs are found . for a given @xmath21 value",
    ", the point - density is estimated as :    @xmath22    where @xmath21 is the index of the nearest neighbor used to calculate the density and @xmath23 is the area of the circle with radius equal to the distance of the @xmath21-th nearest neighbor @xmath24 .",
    "the uncertainty on the knn density scales with the square root of k , so that the relative fractional error is inversely proportional to the square root of @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , the fractional accuracy of the method increases with increasing @xmath21 at the expense of the spatial resolution . in this paper , we have reconstructed the density maps of the samples considered using values of @xmath21 ranging from 2 to 10 .",
    "while the `` optimal '' value of @xmath21 depends on the typical size ( expressed as number of members ) of the spatial structures that we want to highlight , this number can not be determined _ a priori_. for this reason , we consider an interval of `` reasonable '' @xmath21 values that are roughly proportional to the average density of sources of the samples for which the density maps are reconstructed . moreover",
    ", large values of @xmath21 would result in over- and under - density structures that are smoothed over large areas and that have lost part of the spatial information they carry .",
    "we produced residual maps , by subtracting from the observed density maps a smooth distribution based on the observed radial number density profiles . using the smooth distribution as seed for monte carlo simulations , we have then estimated the statistical significance of any inhomogeneities apparent in the residual map .",
    "given the relatively sparse data we have used 5000 simulations in each case .",

    "while this structure is not significant _ per se _ , the fact that it is close to a high - significance under - density makes it unlikely that it is due to a random density contrast .",

    "a group of positive residual pixels in the red gcs map are located in the external region of the arc feature ( s - w of the center of ngc4278 ) .",
    "another less significant structure is approximately placed along the n - e streamer . in the residual maps generated with the blue gcs , a fairly significant over - density ( @xmath55 )",
    "is located on the n tip of the streamer feature , while few positive pixels overlap the innermost section of the s - w arc .",
    "our analysis demonstrates the presence of significant inhomogeneity in the projected spatial distribution of lmxbs in ngc4278 , including an arc to the south of the nucleus , a radial streamer , and an over - density at large radii .",
    "these features are reminiscent of those reported in the elliptical galaxies ngc4261  @xcite and ngc4649  @xcite .",
    "the study of the 2d distribution of lmxbs in ngc4261  @xcite was based on a relatively short single chandra observation , leading to the detection of a small number of highly luminous sources .",
    "these results may be questioned by following deeper studies because of source variability ( a. zezas , work in preparation ) . in the case of both ngc4278 and",
    "ngc4649 the lists of lmxbs were derived from the analysis of several coadded deep observations taken over varied time spans , which would average over variability effects . moreover , in ngc4278 a later snapshot , not included in  b09 , was obtained to study long - term variability of luminous lmxbs  @xcite .",
    "the full data set confirms the spatial features discussed in this paper ( see figure 1 of  @xcite ) .",
    "the arc and the over - density at large radii are seen only in the 2d distribution of lmxbs associated with gcs .",
    "the 2d spatial distributions of red and blue gcs also show significant features .",
    "in particular , within the central region of the galaxy , an over - density in the red gc distribution is coincident with the lmxb arc , and features can also be seen loosely correlated with the lmxb streamer . at larger radii , apart from a significant over - density of gcs associated with the position of the galaxy ngc4283 , two main features dominate the spatial distribution of gcs : a significant under - density region located e of ngc4278 and close to the @xmath1 isophote of ngc4283 , most evident in the red gcs map , and a significant over - density on the w side of ngc4278 , which is clearly visible in all residual maps .    as discussed in our previous work",
    "@xcite , these spatial features are strongly suggestive of the effects of galaxy growth by accretion of satellites and merging with neighboring galaxies .",
    "these phenomena have been observed in our local group , and are connected with streams of gcs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gcs are likely to be the individually detectable fossil remnants of these events in more distant galaxies  ( see e.g. , the simulation of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . similarly , x - ray binaries are also individually detectable tracers of their parent stellar population  @xcite .",
    "the three elliptical galaxies we have investigated so far , present a range of properties . ngc4261 and ngc4649 are giant ellipticals with @xmath56 , while ngc4278 is of intermediate stellar mass , with @xmath57  @xcite ; all of them have old stellar populations , with ages ranging from 12 to 16.3 gy  ( see compilation in * ? ? ?",
    "while ngc4649 is in virgo , ngc4261 and ngc4278 are in small groups  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "ngc4261 hosts a luminous radio agn  ( 3c270 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc4649 hosts a low - luminosity nuclear radio source  @xcite and ngc4278 has a liner nucleus , which is also detected in the radio  @xcite .",
    "of the three galaxies , ngc4649 is the only one associated with a prominent luminous extended hot halo  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these three galaxies all present some sign of merging or accretion of external matter , other than our results : ngc4261 has clear boxy isophotes  @xcite , usually suggestive of merging  @xcite .",
    "recent kinematical measurements  @xcite suggest that ngc4649 might be a major dry merger remnant , showing disk - like outer rotation , which suggests a massive lenticular galaxy ( s0 ) progenitor .",
    "ngc4649 has a near neighbor , the spiral galaxy ngc4647 , with which it is likely to be tidally interacting  @xcite . both ngc4261 and ngc4649 are early - type supernova ( sn ) ia host galaxies",
    "sn 1939b , located close to the outer side of the large - scale arc structure of gcs discussed by  @xcite in the s - w quadrant of ngc4261 , was discovered by  @xcite and was later classified as type ia sn .",
    "type ia sn 2004w  @xcite was located 51.6@xmath16 w and 78.7@xmath16 s of the nucleus of ngc4649 , where a low significance over - density of gcs has been determined ( see right plot in figure  3 of  @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of type ia sns in these two galaxies hints at intermediate age stellar population that could be linked to past merger and/or interaction events .",
    "ngc4278 is relatively more isolated , although also has a near neighbor , ngc4283 .",
    "moreover , it has a complex multi - phase ism  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "ngc4278 has a large massive hi ring , extending for 37 kpc  @xcite , which may be slowly accreting  @xcite .",
    "this disk extends down to @xmath581 kpc , where a ionized rotating disk is found  @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the hi ring in ngc4278 has a complex structure , with two faint tail - like structures at large radii , pointing towards s - w and n - e of the center of the galaxy respectively ( see figure  1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "while both hi tails are more spatially extended than the over - densities in the gcs and lmxbs distributions discussed in this paper , we notice that the gcs over - density h ( lower panels of figure  [ fig:2dmapsngc4278_gc_new ] ) overlaps the base on the s - w hi tail - like structure .",
    "@xcite discuss the origin of the neutral gas in early - type galaxies , arguing that while merger or accretion events are thought to be the origin of some of the structures observed in the spatial distribution of hi , the lack of perturbation in the stellar population of some galaxies suggests that cold accretion from the inter - galactic matter ( igm ) could also be responsible for the presence of neutral gas .",
    "the hi disk in ngc4278 is co - located with a disk of x - ray emission and with complex and irregular dusty filaments , which may be streaming towards the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "these features have also been interpreted as due to slow accretion of the hi gas , unaccompanied by star formation , given the old stellar population age ; the x - ray disk may be the result of conduction heating of the incoming material by a more diffuse hotter x - ray emitting ism  ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , the inhomogeneity we have discovered tells a different , perhaps complementary , story . given the old stellar age and the regular appearance of the stellar spheroid , any lmxbs originating for the evolution of native binary systems in the stellar field , ought to be distributed smoothly , closely following the stellar surface brightness .",
    "if the gc populations themselves were also formed early in the history of ngc4278 , the same would hold for the distribution of gcs and their associated lmxbs . while this is true overall in the radial distribution of lmxb number density  ( see figure 4 of b09 ) ,",
    "our results clearly show that there are local perturbations to this picture .",
    "therefore some of the accretion events in ngc4278 may have involved the disruption of dwarf companions or perhaps result in some localized star formation , that while not visible against the preponderant old stellar population may be revealed by the lmxb and gc inhomogeneities .",
    "we have discovered statistically significant spatial inhomogeneities in the 2d distributions of lmxbs and gcs in the intermediate mass elliptical ngc4278 . in particular ,",
    "in the inner region of the galaxy we detect an arc - like feature in the lmxb distribution , which is also reflected in a local over - density of the 2d distribution of red gcs . at larger radii ,",
    "the distribution of gcs is dominated by a very significant over - density likely associated to the nearby galaxy ngc4283 .",
    "two other significant density structures are visible outside of the @xmath1 isophote to the w and e of the center of ngc4278 , associated to an over - density and an under - density respectively .",
    "these features are suggestive of streamers from disrupted and accreted dwarf companions , of which lmxbs and gcs may be the fossil remnants .",
    "ngc4278 is the third galaxy where we have detected this type of feature .",
    "similarly for two previous cases , ngc4261  @xcite and ngc4649  @xcite , the availability of observations has provided us with the ability to characterize the whole gc population of the galaxy and thereby identify the large - scale disturbances with the system .",
    "our exploratory work begs the question of how frequent these features may be .",
    "if they are common , they may revealed widespread continuing galaxy evolution by accretion , in agreement with the predictions of the @xmath2cdm theory  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the study of the 2d distributions of gcs systems ( and lmxbs , when available ) is a valuable tool in these investigations .",
    "the next step will be to obtain good systematic optical coverage of a well chosen sample of elliptical galaxies .",

    "<S> we report significant inhomogeneities in the projected two - dimensional ( 2d ) spatial distributions of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and globular clusters ( gcs ) of the intermediate mass elliptical galaxy ngc4278 . in the inner region of ngc4278 </S>",
    "<S> , a significant arc - like excess of lmxbs extending south of the center at @xmath0 in the western side of the galaxy can be associated to a similar over - density of the spatial distribution of red gcs from  brassington et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2009 ) . using a recent catalog of gcs produced by  @xcite and covering the whole field of the ngc4278 galaxy </S>",
    "<S> , we have discovered two other significant density structures outside the @xmath1 isophote to the w and e of the center of ngc4278 , associated to an over - density and an under - density respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the nature of these structures in the context of the similar spatial inhomogeneities discovered in the lmxbs and gcs populations of ngc4649 and ngc4261 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these features suggest streamers from disrupted and accreted dwarf companions . </S>"
