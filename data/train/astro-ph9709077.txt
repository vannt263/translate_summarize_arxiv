    "thirty - five years after the discovery of the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) , it is still the subject of a great deal of study . on the one hand it offers the possibility of providing an extremely useful tool for the study of large scale structure in the universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and yet on the",
    "other the nature and origin of the xrb is still not well understood .",
    "the deep images made by the rosat satellite have resolved @xmath7 of the @xmath8 background into discrete sources ( @xcite ) and similar observations by the asca satellite have resolved 30% of the @xmath0 background ( @xcite ) . while it is clear that classical active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , i.e. qso s , make a significant contribution to the xrb ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is also clear for a variety of reasons that a substantial contribution must come from some other population . @xmath0 number counts are a factor of @xmath9 to @xmath10 larger than inferred from @xmath11 counts if one assumes a typical agn x - ray spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the spectrum of the xrb is significantly harder that that of agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the strong clustering of qso s is inconsistent with the relatively smooth xrb ( @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "these observations point to a large population of relatively faint ( or highly absorbed ) sources with hard x - ray spectra .",
    "such sources have already begun to be identified with faint galaxies and x - ray bright , narrow emission line galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , comastri et al . (",
    "1995 ) have successfully reproduced the flux and spectrum of the xrb with a model agn luminosity function that includes a large number of highly absorbed seyfert 2s . in either case , if such sources make a substantial contribution then one might expect the x - ray background to be clustered more like galaxies than qsos .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the cross - correlation analysis presented below .    in this paper",
    "we undertake cross - correlation analyses of the ` hard ' ( @xmath0 ) x - ray background with two flux limited radio source surveys , the first survey at 1.4 ghz and the combined gb6/parkes - mit - nrao ( gb6-pmn ) surveys at 4.85 ghz .",
    "while the flux limits of these surveys differ by a factor of @xmath12 , their expected redshift distributions are similar and , therefore , the cross - correlation functions of the two surveys can be directly compared .",
    "the description of the data sets ( x - ray and radio ) and the editing of these sets is described in  2 .",
    "the cross - correlation analysis and significance tests are decribed in  3 .",
    "the formalism to interpret the ccf in terms of a model follows closely the analysis of treyer and lahav ( 1996 ) and is presented in  4 .",
    "the constraints on parameters resulting from the observed ccf s are discussed in  5 .",
    "the heao1 a2 experiment measured the surface brightness of the x - ray background in the @xmath14 band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present data set was constructed from the output of two medium energy detectors ( med ) with different fields of view ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) and two high energy detectors ( hed3 ) with the same fields of view .",
    "these data were collected during the six month period beginning on day 322 of 1978 .",
    "counts from the four detectors were combined and binned in 24,576 @xmath17 pixels in an equatorial quadrilateralized spherical cube projection on the sky ( @xcite ) .",
    "the combined map has a spectral resolution of approximately @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effective point spread function ( psf ) of the map was determined by averaging the psf s of 75 heao1 point sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "the composite psf is well fitted by a gaussian with a full width , half maximum of @xmath19 .",
    "because of the pixelization , the psf varies somewhat with location on the sky ; however , this has little effect on the correlation analysis and so a constant psf is used in the analysis of  4 below .",
    "the dominant feature in the heao map is the galaxy , so all data within @xmath20 of the galactic plane and within @xmath21 of the galactic center were cut from the map .",
    "in addition , @xmath22 diameter regions around @xmath23 discrete x - ray sources with @xmath18 fluxes larger than @xmath24 ( @xcite ) were removed . without this cut",
    "the ccf s were somewhat larger and considerably more noisy due to bright , nearby galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "the resulting `` cleaned '' map covered about 50% the sky . in order to identify additional point sources ,",
    "the map itself was searched for `` sources '' that exceeded the nearby background by a specified amount and @xmath25 diameter regions around these were removed .",
    "cuts were made at several levels from 4 to 10 times the photon noise .",
    "for the most extreme cuts which corresponded to a point source flux of @xmath24 the sky coverage was reduced to about 25% of full sky .",
    "the results of these additional cuts did not significantly affect the correlation analyses and we conclude that the x - ray map contains no point sources with fluxes greater than @xmath24 .",
    "this flux cut is accounted for in the analysis of  4 .",
    "even after cleaning , the x - ray map has several components of large - scale systemic structure which can be corrected for .",
    "if the dipole moment of the cosmic microwave background is a kinematic effect , as it has been widely interpreted ( @xcite ) , then the x - ray background should possess a similar dipole structure ( compton - getting effect ) with an amplitude of @xmath26 .",
    "evidence for this structure is , indeed , found in the heao map ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cleaned map was corrected for this effect .",
    "in addition , a linear time drift in detector sensivity ( @xcite ) results in a large scale structure of known form . finally , the @xmath18 background shows evidence of high latitude galactic emission as well as emission associated with the supergalactic plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "models for these contributions along with the time drift were fit to the x - ray data and subseqently subtracted from the map ( @xcite ) .",
    "these contributions to the x - ray background are on large scales and have little effect on the small angular scale correlation analysis discussed below .    because of the ecliptic longitude scan pattern of the heao satellite , sky coverage and , therefore , photon shot noise are not uniform",
    ". however , the mean variance of the cleaned , corrected map , @xmath27 , is considerably larger than the mean variance of photon shot noise , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the x - ray map is dominated by `` real '' structure ( not photon shot noise ) .",
    "for this reason , in the correlation analyses that follow , we chose to weight each pixel equally .      the first @xmath2 survey is a continuing project to survey @xmath30 square degrees of the north galactic cap ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data used in the analysis below was obtained from the publically available catalog containing @xmath31 sources from observations of 1993 through 1996 .",
    "the catalog covers about @xmath32 square degrees and includes only sources whose peak flux exceeds @xmath33 times the rms noise plus @xmath34 . following cress et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , all pairs of sources within @xmath35 degrees of each other are considered to be part of a single doubled lobed source . for groups of three or more such sources , all sources within @xmath35 degrees of the mean position of the group are considered to be part of a multi - component system and are counted as a single source .",
    "this reduces the total number of sources to @xmath36 .",
    "since noise is not uniform across the coverage region , especially in those areas near very bright sources , the flux limit is not uniform . to correct for this",
    "we have flagged all map areas in which the rms noise is greater than @xmath37 and have removed all sources with peak fluxes less than @xmath38 which corresponds to a @xmath3 detection if @xmath39 .",
    "this further reduces the number of sources to @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that even without the latter correction , the ccf of first sources with the x - ray background is not changed significantly .",
    "this is understandable since non - uniform coverage in the first catalog is not expected to be correlated with systematic structure in the x - ray map .",
    "the remaining first sources are grouped in the same @xmath17 pixels of the quadrilateralized cube projection used for the x - ray map . because of flagged regions as well as the projection itself , not all pixels represent the same solid angle coverage of radio sources .",
    "therefore , the radio coverage of each pixel is used to weight its contribution to the cross - correlation in a way so as not to bias the result . see  3 below .",
    "the number of pixels that contain first data is @xmath41 ; although , somewhat less , @xmath42 , are common to both the first and x - ray maps .",
    "the publically availible parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn ) southern sky survey was made with the 64-m radio telescope at parkes , nsw , australia , and contains about @xmath43 sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the flux limit in this combined survey is not uniform but varies from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . as a compromise between uniform coverage and total number of sources we chose to use a @xmath46 flux limited sample and flagged all portions of the sky",
    "not covered to that level .",
    "this required excluding the zenith zone of the survey .",
    "in addition , only those sources with @xmath47 were included since the northern sources overlapped with the gb6 survey . following loan , wall , & lahav ( 1997 ) we excluded several small regions with extended sources .",
    "finally all regions of the sky within @xmath20 of the galactic plane and within @xmath21 of the galactic center were removed from consideration .",
    "after these cuts 15,233 sources remain in the catalog .",
    "the green bank 6 cm ( gb6 ) survey of the northern sky ( @xmath48 ) was made with the nrao 91 m telescope during 1986 - 7 and contains @xmath49 sources brighter than @xmath50 ( @xcite ) .",
    "rather than worry about comparing the flux calibrations of the gb6 and pmn surveys we chose a somewhat smaller flux limit for the gb6 survey , @xmath51 , which resulted in the equality of the surface density of sources ( @xmath52 ) in the two maps . in any case , the correlation analysis below was performed on the two surveys separatedly as well as on the combined gb6-pmn survey .    the combined gb6-pmn flux limited sources were also grouped in the same @xmath53 pixels as the x - ray map",
    "there are @xmath54 sources and @xmath55 pixels in the combined map which corresponds to @xmath56 sky coverage ; although , only @xmath57 pixels are common to both the gb6-pmn and cleaned x - ray maps .",
    "we define the dimensionless cross - correlation function of the x - ray intensity , @xmath58 , with the radio source number , @xmath59 , as @xmath60 where the sum is over all pairs of pixels , @xmath61 , separated by an angle @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the mean x - ray intensity , and @xmath64 is the mean number of radio sources in the @xmath65 pixel . as discussed in  2.2 ,",
    "the first radio coverage of each @xmath17 pixel is not the same .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the mean surface density of radio sources and @xmath68 is the solid angle of radio coverage of the @xmath65 pixel .",
    "figures 1 and 2 are the ccfs of the @xmath0 heao map with the combined gb6 and pmn surveys and with the first survey . although , the ccfs are shown out to separation angles of @xmath69 , a signficant signal is only detected in the first few bins .",
    "the errors were computed using a `` bootstrap '' analysis ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "100 random radio source catalogs , each of the same size as the original catalog were generated by choosing sources at random from the original catalog . note that this requires some sources will be chosen more than once .",
    "these random catalogs are then cross - correlated with the real x - ray map according to equation ( 3 - 1 ) .",
    "the mean ccf of the random trials was consistent with that of the real data and the rms fluctuation about the mean ccf provides an estimate of the uncertainty due to the additional poisson noise in the distribution of radio sources .",
    "for the first / x - ray ccf , the error estimates where checked in two ways .",
    "a series of 59 radio source maps were generated by a reflection through the celestial equator followed by a rotation about the celestial pole in @xmath70 incremants .",
    "these radio maps were then cross - correlated with the x - ray map which was first transformed into galactic coordinates .",
    "this latter transformation resulted in a pixel coverage nearly the same as that of the original data for small separation angles .",
    "the resulting transformed x - ray and radio maps possessed little small - scale correlation .",
    "the rms scatter of the ccf s of this set of maps agreed with the bootstrap error estimates for @xmath71 and was about @xmath72 larger than the bootstrap estimates for @xmath73 .",
    "an additional rough error estimate was obtained by dividing the two data sets in half and comparing the ccfs of both halves . for two different partitions , north - south and east - west ,",
    "the differences in the two ccfs were consistent with the quoted errors .",
    "both these estimates imply that the bootstrap error estimates are reasonable .",
    "we consider the bootstrap error estimates preferrable in that they reflect the actual distribution of data on the sky . to compare the consistency of the gb6 and pmn portions of the @xmath74 map , the ccf was computed separately for each and the results are plotted in figure 3 .",
    "it is clear that they are consistent with each other ( and with figure 1 ) to within the estimated errors .",
    "figures 1 and 2 demonstrate that there is a statistically significant cross - correlation of radio source counts and the @xmath0 background at the @xmath75 level .",
    "it may appear from the figures that the significance is higher than this ; however , because of the x - ray psf , the error bars are highly correlated .",
    "the correlation coefficients of adjacent errors are typically between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    also evident in figures 1 and 2",
    "is that for @xmath78 the gb6-pmn / x - ray ccf exceeds the first / x - ray ccf by a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , it appears that the latter ccf is more extended than the former .",
    "it is possible that these two properties are related .",
    "it will be shown in  4 that the finite psf of the x - ray map results in a @xmath80 profile similar to that of the gb6-pmn / x - ray ccf even if the only cross - correlation arises from the poisson noise in individual sources . to the extent that the gb6-pmn / x - ray ccf is dominated by poisson noise",
    "it will be both larger in amplitude and more narrow in angular scale than a ccf for which poisson noise is negligible .",
    "we suggest in  4 that this is the case here .",
    "the observed @xmath81 s in  3 , depend on the properties of radio sources and x - ray sources , the spatial clustering of these populations , and the large scale geometry of the universe . among the quantities included in the following model of @xmath81",
    "are the luminosity function of the radio sources , the luminosity ( and density ) evolution of radio sources , the x - ray luminosity of radio sources , the spectrum and evolution of x - ray emissivity , the functional form and evolution of the spatial cross - correlation function , and the cosmological parameters , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "although these parameters provide considerable freedom in fitting the observed @xmath81 , the constraints placed on parameter space are reasonably strong .",
    "the analysis of this section follows closely that of treyer and lahav ( 1996 ) .",
    "the reader is referred to that paper for a detailed analysis .",
    "let @xmath84 be the unnormalized , angular cross - correlation function .",
    "if the sky is divided up into cells of small solid angle @xmath85 , then @xmath86 where @xmath59 and @xmath58 are the number of radio sources in and average x - ray intensity of each cell , and the average is over all cells .",
    "it is straightforward to show that ( @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath87dv_1dv_2\\ ] ] and @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the comoving volume x - ray emissivities of the radio source population and the total x - ray background respectively , @xmath91 is the comoving number density of radio sources , @xmath92 is the luminosity distance , and the integrals are performed over the comoving volumes subtended by the solid angle @xmath85 of the cell . @xmath93 is the spatial cross - correlation function of radio sources with the x - ray background in regions of space separated by a proper distance @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath95\\langle n\\rangle \\langle \\varepsilon_b \\rangle\\ ] ] thus @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 the first term , @xmath99 , arises from poisson fluctuations due to the x - ray emission of the individual radio sources and is equal to the x - ray flux from these sources , i.e. , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mean x - ray intensity of the radio sources . the second term , @xmath102 , is due to the joint clustering of radio sources with the sources of the x - ray background ( including the radio sources ) .    the spatial auto - correlation function ( acf ) of nearby galaxies is well approximated by a power law .",
    "we take this form for the spatial cross - correlation function and assume the standard power law evolution ( @xcite ) @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the proper ( non - comoving ) distance between the sources , @xmath105 is the comoving correlation length , and @xmath106 is a clustering evolution parameter . for ` stable",
    "' clustering @xmath107 while @xmath108 for linearly growing perturbations in an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xcite ) . because the correlation scale length @xmath105 is small , i.e. @xmath109 , sources at significantly different redshifts are uncorrelated . in this case",
    "the integrals in equation ( 4 - 6 ) can be simplified to a single integral over redshift ( @xcite ) , @xmath110 where @xmath111 ; @xmath112 is the angle between @xmath113 and @xmath114 ; @xmath115 ; @xmath116 is the comoving radial coordinate ; and @xmath117 .",
    "this expression can be further simplified by noting that @xmath118 and @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the surface density of radio galaxies at redshift @xmath121 .",
    "following treyer & lahav ( 1996 ) we assume a power law evolution of the @xmath122 xrb volume emissivity , i.e. @xmath123 .",
    "note that @xmath124 includes the `` k - correction '' exponent , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the energy spectral index .",
    "then the expression for @xmath102 becomes @xmath127 equations ( 4 - 7 ) and ( 4 - 10 ) give the value of the cross - correlation at zero separation for an x - ray map with a delta function psf .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for a finite psf and for arbitrary separation angle , @xmath62 , @xmath99 becomes @xmath128 where @xmath129 @xmath130 is the normalized psf , i.e. , @xmath131 , the integration is over the radio cell , and @xmath132 is the location of the x - ray cell relative to the radio cell .",
    "the expression for @xmath133 is again equation ( 4 - 10 ) if @xmath134 is substituted with @xmath135 where @xmath136 indicates an integral over all space .",
    "these two expressions are equivalent to those derived by refregier , helfand , and mcmahon ( 1997 ) recalling that the effective psf used here is the actual psf averaged over an x - ray cell .",
    "it should be noted that , due to the finite psf , the poisson term contributes to the ccf for @xmath137 .",
    "of course , this is why it is problematic to distinguish real clustering from poisson fluctuations .    as an illustration",
    ", figures 1 and 2 show a fit of @xmath138 to the gb6-pmn / x - ray ccf and a fit of @xmath139 to the first / x - ray ccf .",
    "we have chosen @xmath140 to evaluate @xmath134 which is consistent with the auto - correlation function of first sources found by cress et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and similar to the value ( @xmath141 ) for local bright galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "weighted least squares fits to the first 4 data points were performed following a similarity transformation to diagonalize the noise matrix .",
    "as long as the first three points are included , the results are rather insensitive to the number of points included . because of the pixelization of the data , theoretical functions @xmath139 and @xmath138 are evaluted at only those angles appropriate for the data . for aesthetic reasons ,",
    "these points are connected by straight lines in the figures . both of the curves look reasonable for @xmath142 . for @xmath143 , the data of figure 2 fall consistently below the theoretical curve .",
    "this is not unexpected since @xmath144 corresponds to rather large distances at even modest redshifts , e.g. at @xmath145 an angle of @xmath144 corresponds to @xmath146 for an einstein - de sitter universe . on the other hand",
    "the observed galaxy acf displays a break below the power law at lengths @xmath147 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the evolution of very large scale structure in a standard cdm universe ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as an indication of the magnitude of this effect",
    "we have constructed a theoretical ccf from equation ( 4.6 ) with the power - law @xmath148 cutoff above @xmath149 .",
    "figure 4 is a fit of this profile to the first / x - ray ccf .",
    "the discrepancy at large angles is no longer egredious while the amplitude of the fit is nearly the same as in figure 2 .",
    "we make no claim that this model has any particular significance but offer it as an indication of the magnitude of the effect .",
    "the formal @xmath150 for the two fits in figures 1 & 2 are @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively for three degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "fits of @xmath139 to the gb6-pmn / x - ray ccf and of @xmath138 to the first / x - ray ccf give @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "fitting the @xmath138 and @xmath139 profiles simultaneously to the two ccfs does nt improve @xmath150 and , in fact , is consistent with no @xmath138 contribution to the first data and no @xmath139 contribution to the gb6-pmn data .",
    "these results are suggestive that the gb6-pmn ccf is poisson dominated while the first ccf is clustering dominated .",
    "the conclusions are not overly sensitive to @xmath155 .",
    "if @xmath155 is chosen to be that found for the acf of nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath141 , the fit of @xmath134 to the first ccf is somewhat worse ( @xmath156 ) while the @xmath134 profile is even more inconsistent ( @xmath157 ) with the the gb6-pmn ccf .",
    "these matters will be discussed further in  5 .    in order to compare the amplitudes of the predicted @xmath158 with the observed @xmath80s",
    ", a number of parameters must be specified : @xmath155 , @xmath124 , @xmath159 , @xmath106 , @xmath105 , and @xmath160 , the redshift at which x - ray sources `` turn on '' and thus the upper limit to the integral in equation ( 4 - 10 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath161 and @xmath162 require an assumption about the large - scale geometry of the universe , and the distribution of radio sources @xmath163 depends on the evolving luminosity function of radio sources as well as on the geometry of the universe .    in the analysis that follows @xmath163 is computed from the fundamental `` free - form model '' of the radio luminosity function of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) with low flux cutoffs appropriate to the two surveys .",
    "figures 5 and 6 are the @xmath163s computed from this model for the gb6-pmn and first surveys . for the @xmath164 peak flux cut in the first survey ,",

    "we have repeated the analyses using the evolving luminosity and number density model of dunlop & peacock and , although the @xmath163s are somewhat different , the differences in the correlation analyses are small . because @xmath163 falls off at large redshift , the computed values of @xmath102 are rather insensitive to @xmath160 ; however , this parameter is important in constraining x - ray emissivity .",
    "the emissivity @xmath159 of the x - ray background must satisfy the constraint that the integrated intensity equal that observed for the @xmath0 background , i.e. @xmath166 ( @xcite ) .",

    "in addition , it is quite likely that a simple power law evolution is not the best description of x - ray emissivity .",
    "if one arbitrarily sets @xmath167 , then , for an einstein - de sitter universe , the local x - ray emissivities implied for @xmath168 @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath169 are @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",

    "it appears that for power law evolution models , @xmath124 is constained to fall between @xmath9 and @xmath169 . as a somewhat more sophisticated model of evolution",
    "we consider the unified agn model of comastri et al .",

    "model is relatively flat and that a @xmath186 power law evolution gives a flat redshift distribution . in the analysis that follows",
    ", we will use the comastri et al .",
    "model for the evolving x - ray emissivity as our `` best guess '' but will compare the results of this model with those of @xmath187 power law models .    because of the large angular resolution ( @xmath4 ) of the heao map , most of the contribution to the ccf arises from nearly linearly evolving structures . at @xmath145 , @xmath188 corresponds to @xmath189 which is comparable to the transition from the linear to non - linear regime in the local universe . in the `` best guess '' model below , roughly @xmath72 of the contribution to the ccf comes from redshifts below @xmath145 where evolution is modest and @xmath72 comes from redshifts @xmath190 where @xmath188 is in the linear regime .",
    "for this reason we assume for our `` best guess '' model that structure is growing linearly in an einstein - de sitter universe , i.e. , @xmath191 .",
    "however , the change in the results if the clustering is stable , i.e , @xmath192 and for open and `` @xmath193 '' universes will be discussed .",
    "finally one must take into account the flux limit ( @xmath194 ) on x - ray sources .",
    "there is no well - defined procedure to do this for the power law models of emissivity evolution since individual source luminosities are not specified .",
    "however , the flux cut can be directly applied to the comastri et al . model and",
    "we have done so .",
    "the net result is to roll off the x - ray flux at @xmath195 . to the extent that faint ( non - agn )",
    "x - ray sources contribute significantly to the x - ray background this results in an underestimate of @xmath102 . we take the lower limit of the @xmath102 integral to be @xmath196 ( @xmath197 )",

    ", @xmath102 is increased by a factor of @xmath210 .    a change in the value of @xmath155 in our `` best guess '' model changes the slope as well as the amplitude of the model curves in figure 8 .",

    "does the predicted value of @xmath105 exceed the value implied by the `` best guess '' model and such models imply a local x - ray emissivity below that observed . therefore , we consider that , with two caveats , @xmath232 @xmath233 is an upper limit to the cross - correlation scale length .",
    "the first caveat is that the dunlop - peacock radio luminosity function does not seriously overestimate the number of low luminosity sources .",

    "the other caveat is that the universe has a vanishing cosmological constant . in a flat , low @xmath235 universe",

    "suppose that half the amplitude of the observed @xmath237 is due to poisson fluctuations .",
    "correcting for these fluctuations and fitting the clustering term to the residuals implies a clustering amplitude of @xmath238 and a correlation scale length of @xmath239 @xmath233 .",
    "it seems unlikely that the poisson contribution could be more than this and still be consistent with the observed @xmath80 .",
    "the fitted amplitude of @xmath133 to the gb6-pmn data implies @xmath240 @xmath233 ; however , as pointed out in  4 the @xmath80 profile of this data indicates that poisson fluctuations dominate and , therefore , this value is clearly an overestimate . assuming that the observed ccf is entirely due to possion fluctuations , the fitted amplitude of the angular ccf is ( see figure 1 ) @xmath241 . from equation ( 4 - 11 ) @xmath242 where @xmath243 is",
    "the mean intensity of the x - ray background and @xmath101 is the mean x - ray intensity of the radio sources in the survey .",
    "therefore , the fraction of the xrb that is accounted for by the survey radio sources is given by @xmath244 substituting the inferred value of @xmath231 in this expression implies that @xmath245 of the xrb is due to gb6-pmn radio sources .",
    "this is , of course , an overestimate because clustering has not been taken into account .",
    "a better estimate is got by assuming the gb6-pmn / x - ray data has the same normalized clustering as that of the first / x - ray data , i.e. @xmath246 .",
    "subtracting this from the gb6-pmn / x - ray ccf and fitting the residuals to @xmath99 gives a poisson amplitude of @xmath247 which implies @xmath248 of the xrb is due to gb6-pmn radio sources .",
    "it seems unlikely that the fraction of radio source contribution to the x - ray background could be much less than @xmath249 without requiring a much larger clustering contribution than is allowed by the observed @xmath80 profile .",
    "we note in passing that under the assumptions that the radio number counts have a euclidean dependence on radio flux s , i.e. , @xmath250 , and that the average x - ray to radio luminosity is independent of redshift , the contribution of radio sources to the x - ray background saturates at @xmath251 .",
    "we hasten to add , however , that neither of these assumptions is likely to be true .",
    "the profile of the first / x - ray ccf is consistent with no poisson fluctuations .",
    "however , if we assume that half the amplitude @xmath231 of the observed ccf is due to poisson fluctuations then the implied contribution of the first sources to the xrb is @xmath252 .",
    "we consider this to be an upper limit .",
    "treyer and lahav ( 1996 ) suggested that cross - correlation analyses of the type above might enable one to map the x - ray volume emssivity as a function of redshift .",
    "unfortunately , the current result is not very useful in this regard .",
    "although the mean redshift of the two radio surveys is quite large , @xmath253 , the primary contributions to the ccf comes from lower redshifts , i.e. @xmath254 from @xmath255 .",
    "the result is that the ccf analysis is not very senstive to the evolution of emissivity .",
    "for example , the @xmath102 for a model with non - evolving emissivity , @xmath256 @xmath257 , is the same as the @xmath102 for our `` best guess '' model .",
    "although such a model is wildly inconsistent with the level of the xrb , it is quite consistent with both the observed ccf and local x - ray emissivity ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus far only upper limits on the clustering of the hard x - ray background have appeared in the literature .",
    "we are left with the question of how to interpret the cross - correlation reported in this paper .",
    "if one assumes `` linear biasing '' then @xmath258 where @xmath259 is mass density , @xmath260 is radio source density , @xmath261 is x - ray volume emissivity , @xmath262 indicates @xmath263 fluctuations in these quantities , and @xmath264 and @xmath265 are the radio and x - ray bias factors . to the extent that the bias factors are independent of scale , the spatial acfs of the quantities are related by @xmath266 if @xmath267 , then @xmath268 and @xmath269",
    ". then the cross - correlation function satisfies @xmath270 assuming that @xmath271 , the cross - correlation scale length , @xmath272 is equal to the geometric mean of the two auto - correlation scale lengths , i.e. , @xmath273 while it is likely that both of these assumptions are violated to some extent , it seems reasonable that equation ( 5 - 6 ) is a valid approximation .",
    "the expression for the unnormalized acfs for x - ray flux and radio source counts is equation ( 4 - 15 ) with @xmath274 replaced by either @xmath275 for the x - ray acf or @xmath276 for the radio acf . if the psf is a delta function and the cell size is small , the expression for @xmath139 becomes @xmath277 ( @xcite ) where @xmath278 is the solid angle of a cell .",
    "then @xmath279}^{1-\\gamma } dz\\ ] ] where @xmath280 is either @xmath163 or @xmath281 . to obtain the normalized acfs one must divide by either @xmath282 or @xmath283 where @xmath284 or @xmath285 . thus @xmath286^{1-\\gamma}dz \\over ( \\int f(z)dz)^2}.\\ ] ]    the strongest limit on the @xmath0 acf",
    "is from carrera et al .",
    "( 1993 ) where the @xmath287 limit at @xmath288 is @xmath289 . substituting this value into equation ( 5 - 8 ) and using our `` best guess '' model for the xrb we find that @xmath290 .",
    "cress et al . (",
    "1996 ) have recently measured the radio acf for the intial first data release ( about half the number of sources used in this paper ) . from their figure 1",
    "we find that @xmath291 . again substituting this value and the `` best guess '' model parameters into equation ( 5 - 8 ) we find that @xmath292 .",
    "this value agrees with their preliminary reported value ( @xcite ) . substituting these values of @xmath293 and @xmath294 into equation ( 5 - 6 ) implies a constraint on the cross - correlation length of @xmath295 which is consistent with our observed value of @xmath296 . on the other hand , substituting @xmath297 and @xmath298 into equation ( 5 - 6 ) yields @xmath299 which is smaller than the correlation length of galaxies .",
    "this is somewhat bothersome and may imply that either we have underestimated the cross - correlation length scale or that @xmath297 is an overestimate .",
    "the latter will undoubtedly be clarified as more of the first survey is completed .    finally , we pointed out in  4 that the estimate of @xmath272 would be increased if low luminosity radio sources are significantly overestimated by the dunlop - peacock models .",
    "however , the implied constraint on @xmath293 is relatively insensitive to the luminosity function .",
    "for example , if we artificially cut off the radio luminosity function at @xmath300 the inferred limit of @xmath272 increases to @xmath301 while @xmath294 becomes @xmath302 . then equation ( 5 - 6 ) still implies that @xmath299 .",
    "the @xmath0 x - ray background ( at @xmath4 angular resolution ) is signficantly correlated with both @xmath303 first radio source counts and @xmath74 gb6 and parkes - mit - nrao radio source counts .",
    "the amplitude of the cross - correlation functions for these two data sets is @xmath304 for the first / x - ray ccf and @xmath305 for the gb6-pmn / x - ray ccf .",
    "interpreted in terms of a `` best guess '' model ( @xmath181 , linear growth of perturbations , dunlop - peacock radio luminosity function , and a unified agn model of the xrb ) , the first / x - ray ccf implies a comoving correlation length of @xmath306 ( statistical error only ) .",
    "the dependence of this value on model parameters indicates that a reasonable upper limit to the correlation length is @xmath298 . if the first acf correlation length is @xmath297 as has been reported , then the implied xrb acf correlation length is @xmath299 which is somewhat smaller than the galaxy - galaxy correlation length , @xmath307 .",
    "we note in passing that if @xmath308 then the implied x - ray correlation length is @xmath309 and we suggest that future radio observations may reveal the smaller acf implied by this value . in any case ,",
    "a low value of the x - ray correlation length , @xmath310 , is consistent with the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the xrb is due to objects which are less strongly clustered than luminous agns , i.e. qsos .",
