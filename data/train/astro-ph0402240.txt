    "their existence as a class with a different nature than x - ray bursters in the galaxy was first put forward by heise et al .",

    "they introduced an operational definition for xrfs , namely a fast transient source with duration less than 1000  s in the wide field camera ( covering 225  kev ) that did not trigger the gamma ray burst monitor ( covering 40700  kev ) .",
    "bepposax detected 20 such events in the 6 years it was operational ( heise , in t zand , & kippen 2003 ) .",
    "a hete-2 burst is classified as an xrf if its x - ray fluence ( @xmath7 ) exceeds its gamma - ray fluence , i.e. , @xmath8230  kev)/@xmath7(30400  kev)@xmath9 > 0 $ ] ( lamb , donaghy , & graziani 2003 ) .",
    "classical gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are defined as having @xmath8230  kev)/@xmath7(30400  kev)@xmath9 < -0.5 $ ] , while bursts belonging to the intermediate class are classified as x - ray rich grbs , following castro - tirado et al .  ( 1994 ) .",
    "xrfs can be interpreted as the same phenomenon as classical grbs with the difference being that the high energy spectra for xrfs are softer than for grbs ( heise et al .",
    "2001 ; barraud et al .",
    "the high energy spectra ( @xmath10 ) of grbs are well described by the so called band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) , which is composed of two smoothly connected power - laws .",
    "the energy at which the two power - laws connect is referred to as @xmath11 and is where most of the energy usually is emitted . for classical grbs @xmath11 is typically a few 100  kev @xcite .",
    "the high energy spectra of xrfs are also well fitted by the band function , but with values of @xmath11 below 100  kev and in some cases even below 10  kev @xcite .",
    "for classical grbs there is a correlation between spectral hardness , defined as the fluence in the x - ray band divided by the fluence in the gamma - ray band , and the fluence in the gamma - ray band in the sense that hard bursts have a higher total fluence @xcite .",
    "xrfs follow this correlation @xcite .",
    "these properties of grbs and xrfs would be naturally explained if xrfs were grbs at very large redshifts .",
    "however , the lack of excessive time dilation compared to grbs argues against this interpretation @xcite . moreover , amati et al .  ( 2002 ) find in a sample of 12 bepposax grbs with known redshifts that the total isotropic equivalent energy radiated in the 110000  kev range is positively correlated with @xmath11 .",
    "this also argues against very large redshifts for xrfs .",
    "instead the current view is that xrfs are either _",
    "i ) _ the result of classical grbs seen off - axis ( yamazaki et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; dado et al.2003 ; rhoads 2003 ) , _ ii ) _ so - called dirty fireballs , which are relativistic jets with a larger baryon load and hence ( assuming external shocks ) lower @xmath12-factor than those of classical grbs ( dermer , chiang , & bttcher 1999 ; heise et al .",
    "2001 ) , or _",
    "iii ) _ fireballs with large @xmath12-factors and/or low baryon loading that in the case of internal shocks lead to the emission of less energetic photons ( zhang & mszros 2002 ; barraud et al .  2003 ) .",
    "prior to xrf  030723 , four xrfs had been localized to arcmin accuracy .",
    "the first was the bepposax burst xrf  011030 ( e.g. , heise et al .",

    "images were secured at the d1.5 m also on the following night to facilitate detection of the afterglow as a transient source .",
    "comparison of the images from the first and second epoch observations revealed no apparent transients in the error - box @xcite .",
    "this later turned out to be due to the small initial variability of the afterglow : within the errors the afterglow had the same r - band magnitude 4.2  h and 21.0  h after the burst .",
    "the detection of the optical afterglow was subsequently reported by fox et al .",
    "the fact that we had observed an initially flat light curve suggested to us that xrf  030723 was an off - axis grb .",
    "off - axis bursts should only be observable to modest redshifts ( yamazaki et al .",

    "initially each image was run through daophot and allstar to produce a point - spread function ( psf ) and a star list .",
    "subsequently daomaster and daomatch were used on the allstar photometry to derive positional transformations between the images and generate a master star list . from the master star list 7",
    "isolated objects were selected as psf stars and then a new psf was generated for each image using these stars .",
    "after this step , we obtained the final psf photometry using the allframe program ( stetson 1994 ) , with the psfs and positional transformations generated above .",
    "the errorbars reported on the photometry are those produced by allframe .",
    "the relative magnitudes were transformed to the standard system using observations of the mark a field . for the near - ir data we used aperture photometry and used 2mass stars in the field for photometric calibration .",

    "the nearest other galaxy is located about 2 arcsec north of the position of the afterglow .",
    "whereas we can not exclude this object as the host galaxy it is most likely unrelated to xrf  030723 .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath54 to be an upper limit on the magnitude of the host galaxy of xrf  030723 .",
    "further deep imaging is required to reveal the nature of the host galaxy .",
    "this study of xrf  030723 is the first example of an xrf optical afterglow that has been extensively monitored .",
    "the properties of the early light curve and sed are consistent with the hypothesis that xrfs are due to the same phenomenon as classical grbs , but seen at a larger viewing angle . in this scenario",
    "the early light curve is the result of the competition between two effects : _",
    "i ) _ the decrease in observed flux from the afterglow with time as for normal on - axis grbs , and _",
    "ii ) _ an increase in flux from the afterglow as more and more of the jet becomes visible to the observer with time . the combination of these effects results in a flatter early light curve than for grb afterglows and even a rising early light curve for some viewing angles ( see granot et al .  2002 ; rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ; and dado et al .",
    "2003 for a discussion in the case of fireball and cannonball models respectively ) .",
    "in addition , the shape of the jet may be important . in the collapsar model",
    "there is more slowly moving material further away from the jet axis , and the early optical afterglow from an xrf will be dominated by emission from this material ( zhang , woosley , & heger 2003 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "the exact shape of the early light curve will hence be a function of the jet structure , the viewing angle , and the density profile of the environment .",
    "it is possible to reconcile the tentative rotse - iii detection with the off - axis scenario in the following way : the steep decline following the constant phase indicate that this radiation comes from material that is off - axis , i.e. , our line of sight is outside the range of angles in which this material flows out . the decay rate during the rotse observations is poorly constrained , but a steep decay , approximately @xmath55 , is most consistent with our first data point .",
    "that means that this material , too , is viewed off - axis , and very likely is the same material that caused the off - axis prompt emission to which we attribute the xrf .",
    "because the strength of off - axis emission decreases very steeply with angle away from the axis , this suggests that our line of sight is not too far outside the opening angle of the fast material that made the prompt emission . that then does not leave much solid angle for the slower material which caused the plateau .",
    "the time of its break , about 1 day after trigger , implies an opening angle of about 10 degrees for explosion energies and external densities typical of ordinary grbs , and a minimum initial lorentz factor of 510 for this material .",
    "its total energy must be larger than that of the faster material , in order to cause the strong reflare responsible for the flat light curve .",
    "it is important to note that for this interpretation it is not required that the slower material be further off - axis than the fast material : it could also occupy the same cone , but follow behind the fast material and cause a re - energizing of the original forward shock .",
    "we note that flat light curves have been seen also for a few classical grbs .",
    "the optical afterglow of grb  970508 was almost constant from 3  h to 24  h after the burst .",
    "it then rose by about one magnitude before it entered the usual power - law decline ( pedersen et al .",
    "panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) interpret this light curve as the result of a slightly off - axis grb .",
    "the rotse - iii observations of the optical afterglow of grb  030418 showed a rise during the first 600  s and a roughly constant level during the following 1400  s ( smith et al .",
    "finally we note that the light curve of grb  000301c displayed a flat light curve 34 days after the grb ( jensen et al .",
    "2001 ) .    the late afterglow light curve , i.e.  from 1 to 56 days after the burst , is also as expected for off - axis grbs .",

    ") reflecting the slope of the distribution of energies for relativistic electrons producing the afterglow emission in the synchrotron model ( e.g. , van paradijs et al .",
    "2000 ) . finally , the spectral slope of @xmath57 is also typical for grb afterglows ( e.g. , simon et al .",

    "[ fig : lc ] as the signature of a sn .",
    "the putative supernova peaks after about 16 days in the r - band , and the spectral energy distribution after the peak becomes significantly redder than the early power - law spectra ( see sect .  [ sed ] ) .",
    "this motivates us to investigate whether the bump is consistent with a supernova origin , in terms of peak luminosity , timing and sed .",
    "the peak time of approximately 16 days after the xrf is early even for a local supernova .",
    "the light curve peak is also unusually narrow .",
    "fitting a simple gaussian to the peak gives a value of 1.7 mag for @xmath74m@xmath75 , i.e. , the increase in magnitude between peak and 15 days later .",
    "correcting for time dilation corresponding to a reasonable redshift , the intrinsic width gets even smaller ( and @xmath74m@xmath75 larger ) .",
    "early , narrow sn light curve peaks are expected from progenitor stars that have lost ( most of ) their hydrogen ( and helium ) envelopes . of the known supernovae ,",
    "the one we have found to produce the best match to the light curve is the type ic sn  1994i . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] we plot the b - band light curve of sn  1994i redshifted to @xmath76 on top of the light curve of xrf  030723 .",
    "we have subtracted an extrapolation of the power - law afterglow component ( from the beuermann fit ) .",
    "the errors include the photometric error as well as the formal error from the subtraction of the beuermann fit .",
    "as seen , the match is qualitatively acceptable except for data points before the peak .",
    "we can not , however , exclude an afterglow light curve shape that is different from the purely empirical beuermann function",
    ". such a difference would give large systematic errors on the data point prior to the peak .",
    "in particular , a steeper late time decay slope would leave more room for a longer rise time for the sn .",
    "sn  1994i displayed a very fast light curve ( richmond et al .",
    "further , the observations of sn  1994i show that the peak width becomes narrower at shorter wavelengths , so a near - uv light curve will surely be intrinsically more narrow than a b - band light curve , partially canceling the time dilation effect .",
    "in addition , the decline rate , as measured by @xmath77 , also differs considerably between different type ic supernovae .",
    "richmond et al .",
    "( 1996 ) estimate for sn  1994i that @xmath74m@xmath78 ( our estimate ) , @xmath79 , and @xmath74m@xmath80 , while the peak magnitude was reached after 8 , 9 and 10 days ( @xmath81 ) , in the u , b and v bands , respectively . for sn",
    "1998bw we estimate the corresponding numbers from galama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to be @xmath74m@xmath82 , @xmath74m@xmath83 , @xmath74m@xmath84 , and @xmath85 days , @xmath86 days , and @xmath87 days .",
    "finally , sn 2002ap reached maximum brightness in u at 6.2 days , and in v at 9.9 days ( foley et al .",
    "there is thus a large variation in both the rise time and decay time of type ic supernovae .",
    "it is , however , obvious that any supernova connected to xrf  030723 has to have a light curve which is at least as fast as sn  1994i , and quite unlike sn  1998bw .",
    "although sn  1994i is the fastest type ic to date , there is no reason to exclude even faster scenarios . in a simple model ,",
    "the width of the light curve at the peak is set by @xmath88 ( e.g. arnett 1996 ) , where @xmath89 is the total energy , @xmath90 the mass of the ejecta , and @xmath91 the opacity .",
    "a faster light curve could therefore imply a smaller ejecta mass or / and a more energetic explosion .",
    "a lower effective opacity , caused by e.g. , a higher effective temperature , would also decrease @xmath81 . because the estimated c - o core mass of sn  1994i is only @xmath92 ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1994 ) , the most likely reason for a faster time scale is a higher kinetic energy , possibly in combination with a large asymmetry . as several studies have shown ( e.g. , maeda & nomoto 2003 ; woosley & heger 2003 ) , a highly asymmetric explosion may result in a fast rise time .",
    "a less central distribution of the radioactive @xmath93ni would further enhance this effect . because the diffusion time @xmath94 , faster expansion in the polar direction leads to a shorter @xmath95 and a faster rise time ( hflich , wheeler , & wang 1999 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude at the peak is determined by the amount of ejected @xmath93ni , which is not necessarily correlated with the parameters determining the width of the peak .",
    "the late bump of xrf 030723 peaked at @xmath96 .",
    "this may provide a hint as to the redshift for the object . at a redshift of @xmath97",
    ", the apparent supernova bump would be as faint as sn  1994i .",
    "while the putative supernova could in principle be even fainter than the mediocre sn  1994i , even lower redshifts would also make the host an unusually faint galaxy ( see sect .",
    "[ redshift ] ) . on the other hand , for a redshift of @xmath49 , the assumed bump would correspond to a supernova about three times as bright as the powerful sn  1998bw .",
    "there is not much information from the sed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) to confirm a supernova origin for the late bump",
    ". however , the clear red evolution of the sed can exclude many other possible origins ( see below ) .",
    "if the redshift is as high as @xmath98 , most of the observed optical emission ( ubvri ) will correspond to the near - uv regime , which is poorly known for type ib / c supernovae at early phases .",
    "an hst spectrum of sn  1994i does show a strong depression in the uv at 11 days past b maximum ( millard et al .  1999 ) .",
    "this is also seen in type ia and type iip supernovae , and is interpreted as arising from the strong uv blanketing due to the abundance of overlapping lines from especially , and , as well as bound - free absorption by .",
    "the only really early near - uv spectrum of a type ic supernova we are aware of is a hst spectrum of sn  2002ap taken 6 days before maximum ( courtesy of the sins - team , p.i .",
    "kirshner ) .",
    "this spectrum also shows a steep decline into the uv .",
    "the flux decreases by a factor ten between 4300  to 2700  .",
    "we stress , however , that a comparison with the very limited local sample of type ic supernovae may be misleading for several reasons .",
    "it is quite likely that the x - ray flash emerges in the polar direction , where the expansion velocities are highest and the density lowest .",
    "these parts of the ejecta may also have a higher @xmath93ni fraction , and therefore a higher effective temperature .",
    "these factors may together lead to a higher degree of ionization at these stages , which would make uv line blanketing less effective .",
    "a measurable uv flux at the time of the peak - as would be needed to interpret the light curve bump as due to a supernova at @xmath98 , could therefore result .",
    "if we interpret the non - detections in the @xmath99 bands after the peak as due to the uv - blanketing , the redshift would have to be in the range @xmath100 .",
    "the late @xmath101 band detection also argues against a lower redshift , to match the sed of known type ic supernovae ( e.g. , yoshii et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the absence of any supernova features in the spectrum taken in the bump - phase is not surprising since the expected small amplitude undulations in this limited wavelength range are not likely to stand out at this signal - to - noise ratio ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec1 ] ) .",
    "this is true for sne with large expansion velocities like sn  1998bw .",
    "we can , however , probably exclude sne with lower expansion velocities , as for sn  1994i ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spec1 ] ) .",
    "very broad spectral features , and a narrow light curve , are expected from an energetic and asymmetric explosion viewed pole on ( e.g. , iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; hflich et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in summary , an interpretation of the late , red light curve bump as due to",
    "a supernova at redshift @xmath46 appears to be consistent with the observations .",
    "this fits nicely with the recent findings of a firm supernova connection for grb 030329 ( garnavich et al .",
    "2003 ; stanek et al .  2003 ; hjorth et al .",
    "2003a ) and with the spectroscopic redshift ( @xmath102 ) of the probable host of xrf 020903 ( soderberg et al .",
    "2003 ) . regarding the sed we can",
    "only qualitatively say that the sed is consistent with a supernova which is emitting strongly in the uv at maximum , but for which the uv - depression sets in at later phases .",
    "a more secure and quantitative statement is prevented by the poor knowledge of the early uv spectra of type ic supernovae and the lack of a spectroscopic redshift .",
    "other explanations to consider for the bump are _",
    "i ) _ a refreshed shock ( granot , nakar , & piran 2003 and references therein ) , _ ii ) _ a two - jet model as the one proposed for grb  030329 ( berger et al .",
    "2003 ; huang et al .",
    "2003 ) , _ iii ) _ the encounter with the termination shock of the progenitor wind or other density enhancements ( e.g. , ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2001 ) , _ iv ) _ a dust - echo ( esin & blandford 2000 ; reichart 2001 ) , and possibly _ v ) _ microlensing ( garnavich , loeb & stanek 2000 ) .",
    "the sharp rise of the light curve in the bump phase is difficult to explain for density variations or refreshed shocks .",
    "the light curve can be reasonably well described by a two - jet model ( huang et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , the fundamental problem with most of the alternative models is to explain the sed .",
    "a power - law sed is expected at all epochs , and this is clearly excluded by the data . on the other hand , an increasing absorption of blue light is probably a generic feature for a supernova . we find the dust - echo unlikely as the host appears to be a tiny dwarf galaxy that most likely has a very low dust content .",
    "therefore , we consider a sn the most likely explanation for the late light curve bump . within this scenario ,",
    "the evolution of the x - ray afterglow remains to be fully understood .",
    "we have presented the first detailed multi - color study of the afterglow of an xrf .",
    "the properties of the early light curve are in agreement with the predictions for off - axis classical grbs both in the fireball and cannonball models .",
    "after the first week there is a strong bump in the light curve , peaking at around 16 days after the xrf .",
    "the sed after the peak of the bump becomes significantly redder and can no longer be fit by a power - law .",
    "we have considered the possible interpretations of this bump , e.g. , an underlying supernova , a second jet , a refreshed shock or an encounter with a density enhancement .",
    "we conclude that a sn is the most likely explanation since no other model can qualitatively explain the evolution of the sed .",
    "we also present deep spectroscopy of the burst both in the afterglow and in the bump phase .",
    "unfortunately , no redshift determination has resulted from the spectra as there are no significant absorption or emission lines detected .",
    "a firm upper limit of @xmath59 on the redshift is established from the lack of any ly@xmath6 forest lines in the afterglow spectrum .",
    "if the bump in the light curve is indeed due to a supernova the most likely redshift is in the range @xmath180.31.0 .",
    "the lack of significant absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum and the lack of any indication of extinction in the afterglow sed is indicative that the progenitor was in an environment with lower density than typically found for grbs .",

    "<S> this is in qualitative agreement with the prediction that xrfs are off - axis classical grbs . </S>",

    "<S> the sed after the peak becomes significantly redder . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible interpretations of this bump , and conclude that an underlying supernova is the most likely explanation since no other model appears consistent with the evolution of the sed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present deep spectroscopy of the burst both in the afterglow and in the bump phase . a firm upper limit of @xmath5 is placed on the redshift of xrf  030723 from the lack of ly@xmath6 forest lines in the spectrum of the afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of significant absorption and emission lines in either of the two spectra excludes a spectroscopic redshift determination . </S>"
